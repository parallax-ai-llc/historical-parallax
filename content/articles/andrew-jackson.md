## Summary

Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was the seventh President of the United States, serving from 1829 to 1837, and a controversial figure who fundamentally reshaped American politics and democracy. A military hero celebrated for his victory at the Battle of New Orleans and a champion of the common man against elite interests, Jackson was also a brutal Indian fighter, unrepentant slaveholder, and architect of the Trail of Tears.[^1][^2] His presidency ushered in the era of Jacksonian Democracy, expanding political participation for white men while simultaneously orchestrating policies of ethnic cleansing against Native Americans and defending the institution of slavery.[^3] Jackson's legacy remains deeply polarizing, with admirers praising his populist reforms and critics condemning his genocidal policies and authoritarian tendencies.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region, a disputed border area between North and South Carolina.[^5] His parents, Andrew Jackson Sr. and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, were impoverished Scots-Irish Presbyterian immigrants who had emigrated from Ulster, Ireland, in 1765.[^6] Tragedy struck the Jackson family before Andrew's birth when his father died at age 29 in February 1767, just three weeks before his son was born, leaving Elizabeth to raise three boys alone in frontier poverty.[^7]

Jackson's childhood was marked by violence and loss during the Revolutionary War. At age thirteen, he and his brother Robert joined the Continental Army as couriers.[^8] In 1779, his oldest brother Hugh died of heat stroke following the Battle of Stono Ferry.[^9] The war's devastation reached its climax for Jackson in 1781 when he and Robert were captured by British forces. During their imprisonment, a British officer struck Jackson with a saber for refusing to clean his boots, leaving permanent scars on his hand and head—and a lifelong hatred of the British.[^10] Both brothers contracted smallpox in prison; Robert died shortly after their release.[^11]

His mother Elizabeth then traveled to Charleston to nurse American prisoners of war, where she contracted cholera and died in November 1781, leaving fourteen-year-old Andrew an orphan.[^12] This series of traumatic losses during his formative years—losing his entire immediate family to war and disease—profoundly shaped Jackson's fierce temperament and his view of the world as a harsh, unforgiving place where only the strong survived.[^13]

Despite his rough upbringing, Jackson pursued education intermittently and eventually studied law in Salisbury, North Carolina. In 1787, at age twenty, he was admitted to the bar, and the following year he moved west to the frontier settlement of Nashville in what would become Tennessee.[^14] This move to the frontier proved pivotal, allowing the ambitious young lawyer to establish himself in a society less rigid than the established Eastern states.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Jackson's ascent from orphaned frontier lawyer to national political figure was marked by military heroism, political acumen, and ruthless determination. After settling in Nashville, Jackson quickly established himself as a successful attorney and land speculator, accumulating wealth and social standing.[^16] His marriage to Rachel Donelson Robards in 1791, though marred by controversy over the uncertain status of her divorce from her first husband, connected him to one of Tennessee's most prominent families.[^17]

His political career began when Tennessee achieved statehood in 1796, and Jackson became the state's first congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives.[^18] He briefly served in the U.S. Senate (1797-1798) before becoming a Tennessee Superior Court judge from 1798 to 1804.[^19] However, it was military glory rather than political office that would propel Jackson to national prominence.

Jackson became a major general in the Tennessee Militia in 1802, but his opportunity for military distinction came during the War of 1812.[^20] In 1813-1814, he commanded forces in the Creek War, a brutal conflict against the Red Stick Creek Indians allied with the British. On March 27, 1814, Jackson achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, where his forces of 3,300 men—including Cherokee and Lower Creek allies—killed nearly 1,000 Red Stick warriors while suffering only 150 casualties.[^21][^22] Following this victory, Jackson forced the Creek Nation to sign the Treaty of Fort Jackson, ceding 23 million acres—half of present-day Alabama and part of southern Georgia—to the United States.[^23]

In 1818, Jackson further enhanced his military reputation during the First Seminole War when he invaded Spanish Florida without explicit authorization, pursuing Seminole Indians and escaped slaves across international borders.[^24] He captured Spanish forts at St. Marks and Pensacola, occupying the latter for fourteen days and creating an international incident that nearly sparked war with Spain.[^25][^26] While controversial, Jackson's aggressive actions ultimately pressured Spain into ceding Florida to the United States in the Adams-Onís Treaty of 1819.[^27]

But it was the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, that transformed Jackson into a national icon. Leading a diverse force that included regular army troops, militia, free men of color, and even pirates, Jackson's army decimated a superior British force, inflicting over 2,000 casualties while suffering only 71.[^28] Though the battle occurred after the peace treaty ending the War of 1812 had been signed (but before news reached America), it provided Americans with a triumphant conclusion to an otherwise inconclusive war and made Jackson the most celebrated military figure since George Washington.[^29]

Jackson's first run for the presidency in 1824 ended in bitter controversy. He won a plurality of both the popular vote (over 150,000 votes) and electoral votes (99), but failed to secure the required majority.[^30] The election went to the House of Representatives, where Speaker Henry Clay threw his support to John Quincy Adams, who won on the first ballot with 13 states to Jackson's 7.[^31] When Adams subsequently appointed Clay as Secretary of State, Jackson and his supporters denounced what they called a "corrupt bargain," claiming the election had been stolen from the people's choice.[^32][^33] This alleged conspiracy fueled a four-year campaign that culminated in Jackson's landslide victory in the 1828 presidential election, ushering in a new era in American politics.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Andrew Jackson's presidency from 1829 to 1837 fundamentally transformed American politics, governance, and territorial expansion, establishing precedents that resonated for generations. His achievements, though often controversial, reflected his commitment to expanding democracy for white Americans, strengthening presidential power, and pursuing aggressive territorial expansion.

**Democratic Reforms and Political Participation**: Jackson championed what became known as Jacksonian Democracy, a political movement that dramatically expanded political participation among white men.[^35] By the time of Jackson's election, most states had eliminated property requirements for voting, and Jackson rode this wave of democratization while promoting the idea that ordinary citizens should have greater influence in government.[^36] His administration embraced the "spoils system"—rewarding political supporters with government positions—which, despite its corruption, represented a democratization of patronage that had previously been monopolized by Eastern elites.[^37][^38]

**The Bank War**: Perhaps Jackson's most significant domestic policy achievement was his successful campaign against the Second Bank of the United States, which he viewed as a corrupt institution serving wealthy elites at the expense of common people.[^39] When Congress passed a bill to recharter the Bank in 1832, Jackson delivered a stinging veto message on July 10, 1832, arguing that the Bank was "incompatible with justice, sound policy, and the Constitution."[^40][^41] He characterized the Bank as an instrument of the wealthy that created unfair advantages for merchants and speculators while excluding farmers, artisans, and small businesses.[^42] Jackson made the Bank the central issue of his 1828 reelection campaign and won decisively, interpreting his victory as a mandate to destroy the institution.[^43] He subsequently withdrew federal deposits and placed them in state banks, effectively killing the Bank by 1836 when its charter expired.[^44] This victory established presidential power to shape economic policy and appealed to Jackson's agrarian supporters who distrusted centralized financial power.

**The Nullification Crisis**: Jackson demonstrated both his commitment to federal authority and his political skill during the Nullification Crisis of 1832-1833.[^45] When South Carolina, led by Vice President John C. Calhoun, declared the federal tariffs of 1828 and 1832 unconstitutional and threatened to nullify them within state borders, Jackson responded with characteristic force.[^46][^47] On December 10, 1832, he issued a Proclamation to the People of South Carolina, asserting federal supremacy and declaring nullification treasonous.[^48] Jackson persuaded Congress to pass the Force Act authorizing military action against South Carolina while simultaneously supporting a compromise tariff that gradually reduced rates.[^49] This combination of firmness and flexibility resolved the crisis, preserved the Union, and established important precedents about federal authority that would influence debates leading to the Civil War.[^50]

**Military Victories and Territorial Expansion**: Beyond his presidency, Jackson's military achievements significantly expanded American territory. His victory at Horseshoe Bend and the subsequent Treaty of Fort Jackson opened millions of acres to white settlement.[^51] His invasion of Florida and aggressive actions during the First Seminole War pressured Spain into ceding Florida to the United States.[^52] The Battle of New Orleans, while technically fought after the War of 1812 ended, secured American control of the Mississippi River and the port of New Orleans, critical for westward expansion.[^53]

**Strengthening the Presidency**: Jackson fundamentally altered the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, transforming the presidency from a relatively weak office into a powerful institution.[^54] He vetoed more bills than all previous presidents combined, using the veto not merely on constitutional grounds but to advance his policy preferences.[^55] By casting himself as the direct representative of the people against Congress and special interests, Jackson established the modern conception of the president as a popular tribune with an independent power base.[^56]

**Expansion of Suffrage**: While Jackson himself did not engineer the expansion of voting rights—most reforms predated his presidency—his political movement championed and accelerated the trend toward universal white male suffrage.[^57] By the end of his presidency, nearly all property requirements for voting had been eliminated, and presidential electors were chosen by popular vote rather than state legislatures in most states.[^58]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Andrew Jackson's presidency and life were marked by actions and policies that have drawn severe criticism from historians, Native American communities, and civil rights advocates. These controversies have increasingly overshadowed his accomplishments in modern historical assessments.

**The Trail of Tears and Indian Removal**: Jackson's most damning legacy is the Indian Removal Act, which he signed into law on May 28, 1830.[^59] This legislation authorized the president to negotiate removal treaties with Native American tribes east of the Mississippi River, forcing them to relocate to designated Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma.[^60] During Jackson's presidency and that of his successor Martin Van Buren, more than 60,000 Native Americans from at least 18 tribes were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands.[^61]

The most notorious result was the Cherokee Trail of Tears in 1838-1839, when approximately 16,000 Cherokees were forced to march over 1,000 miles to Oklahoma, with roughly 4,000—one quarter of the Cherokee Nation—dying from exposure, disease, and starvation along the way.[^62] Jackson ignored the Supreme Court's ruling in Worcester v. Georgia (1832), which recognized Cherokee sovereignty, allegedly declaring, "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it."[^63] Since the 21st century, scholars have increasingly characterized Indian Removal as state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing, genocide, or settler colonialism.[^64] Jackson and other policymakers claimed the policy would "save" Indigenous peoples from extinction, but this paternalistic justification masks what was fundamentally a land grab motivated by white settlers' desire for Native territory and the discovery of gold on Cherokee lands.[^65]

**Slavery and the Slave Trade**: Jackson was an unrepentant slaveholder who "never questioned the morality of slavery," distinguishing him from earlier slave-owning presidents like Jefferson and Washington who expressed at least rhetorical ambivalence.[^66] Between 1788 and 1865, Jackson and his immediate heirs enslaved 325 people, with Jackson personally owning 95 enslaved individuals when first inaugurated and 150 at his death.[^67] His Hermitage plantation was built on slave labor, primarily producing cotton for profit.[^68]

Jackson's treatment of enslaved people was notably brutal. In 1804, he placed a runaway slave advertisement offering "ten dollars extra, for every hundred lashes any person will give him, to the amount of three hundred"—the only advertisement among 1,200 reviewed where a slaveholder offered financial incentive for beating an enslaved person.[^69] During the Battle of New Orleans, Jackson conscripted approximately 500 enslaved men to fight, allegedly promising freedom to those who served.[^70] However, after the victory, he reneged on these promises, ordering black troops out of New Orleans and forcing them to return to their owners.[^71] According to one account, Jackson declared, "Before a slave of mine should go free, I would put him in a barn and burn him alive."[^72]

**Violence and Dueling**: Jackson's personal life was marked by extreme violence and a hair-trigger temper. Contemporaries described him as "argumentative, physically violent and fond of dueling to solve conflicts."[^73] While estimates of his dueling participation ranged from five to 100, historians confirm he was a principal combatant in at least two formal duels, with the most famous occurring in 1806.[^74]

On May 30, 1806, Jackson killed Charles Dickinson in a duel that originated from a dispute over a horse race and escalated when Dickinson insulted Jackson's wife Rachel, calling her a bigamist.[^75][^76] Dickinson's first shot struck Jackson in the chest near his heart, but Jackson remained standing, took careful aim, and killed his opponent.[^77] In a breach of dueling etiquette that many considered "cold-blooded," when Jackson's pistol initially misfired, he re-cocked and fired again.[^78] Jackson carried Dickinson's bullet in his chest for the rest of his life, suffering chronic pain.[^79]

**Authoritarian Tendencies**: Critics accused Jackson of authoritarian behavior and disregard for constitutional limits. His defiance of the Supreme Court during the Cherokee removal crisis, his aggressive use of executive power, and his purge of government officials earned him the derisive nickname "King Andrew" from political opponents.[^80] His establishment of the "Kitchen Cabinet"—a group of informal advisors including Francis Preston Blair and Amos Kendall who wielded more influence than his official Cabinet—raised concerns about accountability and governance.[^81][^82]

**The Petticoat Affair**: Jackson's first term was consumed by the "Petticoat Affair" or "Eaton Affair," a scandal involving Secretary of War John Eaton's marriage to Margaret "Peggy" Timberlake, a widowed tavern keeper's daughter whom Washington society women shunned as having questionable morals.[^83] Jackson's obsessive defense of Peggy Eaton—partly because attacks on her morality reminded him of the slanders against his own wife Rachel—paralyzed his administration for years and ultimately led to the resignation of his entire Cabinet.[^84]

## Personal Life

Andrew Jackson's personal life was shaped by profound love, devastating loss, and fierce loyalty to those in his inner circle. At the center of his personal world was his relationship with Rachel Donelson Robards, which began under scandalous circumstances but became the foundation of his emotional life.[^85]

Jackson met Rachel in 1788 in Nashville, where she was living separated from her first husband, Lewis Robards.[^86] The exact circumstances remain disputed, but Jackson and Rachel believed Robards had obtained a divorce when they married in 1791.[^87] In reality, Robards had only received permission to file for divorce, which he did not complete until 1793, technically making Rachel's marriage to Jackson bigamous.[^88] Once they discovered the error, Andrew and Rachel remarried in 1794, but the scandal haunted them throughout Jackson's political career.[^89]

Opponents weaponized Rachel's marital history, with Charles Dickinson calling her a bigamist—an insult that led directly to the fatal 1806 duel.[^90] During Jackson's 1828 presidential campaign, political enemies published vicious attacks on Rachel's character, calling her an adulteress and a bigamist.[^91] Jackson later blamed these attacks for Rachel's death from a heart attack on December 22, 1828, just two months before his presidential inauguration.[^92] She was buried on Christmas Eve, and Jackson never remarried during the nearly seventeen years he survived her.[^93]

Rachel's absence profoundly affected Jackson's presidency. Her niece Emily Donelson and later Sarah Yorke Jackson served as White House hostesses, but Jackson wore a miniature portrait of Rachel daily and kept her rooms at the Hermitage as a shrine.[^94] In his view, Rachel's death was not from natural causes but murder by his political enemies—a conviction that intensified his combative approach to politics and his fierce defense of women's reputations, most notably during the Petticoat Affair.[^95]

Jackson and Rachel never had biological children, but they raised several adopted and foster children at the Hermitage, including Andrew Jackson Jr. (the son of Rachel's brother), Lyncoya (a Creek Indian orphan from the Battle of Horseshoe Bend), and several other wards.[^96] Jackson's treatment of Lyncoya reveals his complex and contradictory character: he raised this Native American child in his home with genuine affection while simultaneously orchestrating policies that destroyed Native American nations.[^97]

Jackson's personality was marked by extreme contradictions. He could be extraordinarily loyal and generous to friends and family while being ruthless and vengeful toward enemies.[^98] He suffered from chronic health problems throughout his adult life, including dysentery, tuberculosis, and constant pain from bullets lodged in his body from the Dickinson duel and an 1813 gunfight with the Benton brothers.[^99] Despite these ailments, he projected an image of iron will and physical courage that became central to his public persona as "Old Hickory"—a nickname reflecting his toughness.[^100]

Jackson spent his final years at the Hermitage, his beloved plantation estate outside Nashville, which at its peak spanned over 1,000 acres and produced cotton cultivated by enslaved laborers.[^101] He remained politically active, advising his protégé Martin Van Buren and maintaining extensive correspondence with political allies.[^102] Jackson died on June 8, 1845, at age 78, from a combination of dropsy, tuberculosis, and heart failure, and was buried in the same tomb as Rachel.[^103]

## Legacy

Andrew Jackson's legacy remains one of the most contested in American history, with his influence on American democracy, presidential power, and Native American policy continuing to generate passionate debate nearly two centuries after his presidency.

Jackson fundamentally transformed American political culture. The Democratic Party, which he helped establish, traces its lineage directly to his political movement, and the modern two-party system emerged from the partisan conflicts of his era.[^104][^105] His conception of the presidency as a powerful office representing the popular will against elite interests and Congress established patterns that persist today.[^106] By using vetoes to advance policy preferences rather than merely constitutional objections, Jackson redefined executive power and reversed the tradition of legislative supremacy that had characterized earlier presidencies.[^107]

The expansion of white male democracy during the Jacksonian era—elimination of property requirements for voting, popular election of presidential electors, and the rhetoric of the "common man"—represents a genuine democratization of American politics for its time.[^108] Jackson's campaigns mobilized unprecedented numbers of voters and established partisan newspapers, rallies, and grassroots organization as standard features of American politics.[^109]

However, this democratic expansion for white men came at catastrophic cost to others. Jackson's Indian Removal policy resulted in the deaths of thousands of Native Americans and the destruction of indigenous nations that had inhabited the Southeast for millennia.[^110] The land seized through removal treaties was rapidly filled with cotton plantations worked by enslaved people, extending and strengthening the institution of slavery.[^111] Far from challenging racial hierarchies, Jacksonian Democracy was built on white supremacy and explicitly excluded African Americans, Native Americans, and women from its vision of political equality.[^112]

Jackson's aggressive territorial expansion and support for westward migration by white settlers established patterns that would define American growth throughout the 19th century.[^113] The concept of Manifest Destiny—the belief that American expansion across the continent was both inevitable and divinely ordained—found its practical implementation in Jacksonian policies.[^114]

His economic legacy is more ambiguous. The destruction of the Second Bank of the United States and the proliferation of state-chartered banks led to financial instability, contributing to the Panic of 1837 and subsequent depression.[^115] Yet Jackson's suspicion of concentrated financial power and his defense of hard money against paper currency speculation resonated with many Americans and influenced populist movements for generations.[^116]

In popular memory, Jackson has undergone dramatic reassessment. For most of American history, he was celebrated as a democratic hero, a military icon, and a symbol of American nationalism.[^117] His portrait on the $20 bill (since 1928) reflected this veneration.[^118] Thirteen polls of historians between 1948 and 2009 consistently ranked Jackson among the "great" or "near great" presidents, usually in the top ten.[^119]

However, since the civil rights movement and particularly in recent decades, Jackson's reputation has undergone severe revision. His role in Native American genocide, his brutal treatment of enslaved people, and his authoritarian tendencies have increasingly overshadowed his democratic achievements in historical assessments.[^120] Native American communities and their allies have long opposed honoring Jackson, viewing him as an architect of ethnic cleansing.[^121] In 2016, the Treasury Department announced plans to replace Jackson on the $20 bill with Harriet Tubman, a change that symbolized shifting public values, though implementation has been delayed.[^122]

The scholarly debate over Jackson's legacy has become increasingly one-sided. While some historians still credit him with expanding democracy and strengthening the presidency, most contemporary scholars focus on his role in advancing white supremacy, slavery, and genocide.[^123] As one historian noted, "the recent debate over Jackson's Indian policy has gone mainly one way, with most scholars questioning not whether Jackson acted badly, but whether he acted so badly as to exclude considering anything else he might have done as palliation or excuse."[^124]

Jackson's legacy ultimately embodies the fundamental contradictions of American democracy: a nation founded on principles of equality and self-governance that simultaneously practiced slavery and indigenous dispossession. He expanded political participation for some while orchestrating policies of extermination for others. Understanding Jackson requires grappling with this duality—acknowledging both his genuine contributions to democratic participation and his central role in American racial violence.[^125]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders and admirers of Andrew Jackson emphasize his role as a transformative democratic reformer who broke the power of entrenched elites and expanded political participation for ordinary Americans. This perspective, dominant for much of American history, continues to find support among some historians and political commentators who view Jackson as a populist hero fighting corruption and privilege.

Jackson's supporters credit him with championing the common man against aristocratic interests, particularly through his war against the Second Bank of the United States, which he correctly identified as an institution serving wealthy speculators at the expense of farmers and laborers.[^126] His veto of the Bank recharter is celebrated as a defense of economic democracy against concentrated financial power, a theme that resonates with later populist movements.[^127] Historian Robert Remini, Jackson's most prominent biographer, portrayed him as a genuine democrat who trusted the judgment of ordinary people and worked to expand their political influence.[^128]

Admirers point to Jackson's military heroism and his role in securing American territorial integrity. The Battle of New Orleans made him a symbol of American nationalism and martial prowess, demonstrating that the young republic could defend itself against European powers.[^129] His aggressive pursuit of Florida and his decisive victory over the Creek Nation opened vast territories for American settlement, fulfilling what many Americans saw as their nation's destiny to expand across the continent.[^130]

Jackson's defenders also credit him with strengthening the presidency and establishing it as a co-equal branch of government rather than a subordinate to Congress.[^131] His bold use of executive power, including his willingness to veto legislation on policy grounds, created the modern presidency and provided a template for strong executive leadership.[^132] During the Nullification Crisis, Jackson's firm defense of federal authority and the Union demonstrated presidential leadership that some historians believe prevented early disunion and civil war.[^133]

Some scholars argue that Jackson's Indian policy, while tragic, must be understood in the context of his time, when most white Americans supported removal and when conflict between expanding white settlement and Native nations seemed inevitable.[^134] They contend that Jackson genuinely believed removal would save Native peoples from extinction, even if this belief was paternalistic and ultimately disastrous.[^135] These historians caution against presentism—judging historical figures by modern moral standards they could not have anticipated.[^136]

Political conservatives have sometimes embraced Jackson as a champion of limited government, state's rights (except during nullification), and opposition to centralized federal power, particularly federal banking.[^137] His suspicion of paper money and preference for hard currency appeals to some modern economic libertarians.[^138]

---

### Negative Views

Modern scholarly consensus has shifted dramatically toward critical assessments of Jackson, with historians emphasizing his central role in Native American genocide, the expansion and brutalization of slavery, and the advancement of white supremacist ideology disguised as democratic reform.

The most devastating criticism focuses on Indian Removal. Scholars increasingly describe Jackson's policies as ethnic cleansing and genocide, noting that he deliberately pursued the destruction of Native nations through forced displacement despite knowing the catastrophic human cost.[^139] Jackson ignored legal constraints, including Supreme Court rulings protecting Cherokee sovereignty, demonstrating contempt for the rule of law when it conflicted with his goals.[^140] Historians note that Jackson's stated justification—protecting Native peoples from white encroachment—was demonstrably false, as removal served white land hunger and was implemented with brutal disregard for Native lives.[^141] The Trail of Tears resulted in approximately 4,000 Cherokee deaths alone, with similar mortality rates for other removed tribes.[^142]

Jackson's relationship to slavery has received increased scholarly attention. Unlike some earlier slaveholding presidents who expressed moral ambivalence about the institution, Jackson never questioned slavery's morality and actively participated in the slave trade.[^143] His brutal treatment of enslaved people, including offering bounties for beating runaways and allegedly threatening to burn slaves alive rather than free them, reveals exceptional cruelty even by the standards of his time.[^144] Jackson's expansion of cotton-producing territories through Indian Removal directly strengthened slavery, and his Democratic Party became the primary political defender of the institution, ultimately leading to southern secession.[^145]

Historians criticize the myth of Jacksonian Democracy as excluding the majority of Americans from its benefits. While political participation expanded for white men, Jackson's political movement was explicitly built on racial exclusion and the subordination of women, African Americans, and Native Americans.[^146] Far from being a universal democratizer, Jackson promoted a white man's democracy that entrenched racial hierarchies and justified violence against non-white peoples.[^147] As historian Sean Wilentz notes, Jacksonian Democrats "generally outdid [Whigs] in justifying and promoting ethnic, racial, and sexual exclusion and subordination."[^148]

Jackson's authoritarian tendencies and disregard for constitutional constraints draw strong criticism. His defiance of the Supreme Court, his expansion of executive power beyond constitutional limits, and his use of military force against political opponents (such as his threat to hang nullifiers) reveal anti-democratic impulses beneath his populist rhetoric.[^149] The spoils system he championed, while democratizing patronage, also introduced systematic corruption into government and valued partisan loyalty over competence.[^150]

Recent scholarship has questioned Jackson's economic legacy, noting that his destruction of the Bank of the United States and his opposition to paper currency contributed to financial instability and the Panic of 1837, which caused widespread economic suffering.[^151] His economic policies, driven more by personal vendetta than sound analysis, harmed the very working people he claimed to champion.[^152]

Since the civil rights movement, Jackson's reputation has declined precipitously. Where earlier generations saw a democratic hero, contemporary historians see a white supremacist architect of genocide whose political achievements cannot excuse or outweigh his role in American racial violence.[^153] The movement to remove Jackson from the $20 bill reflects this reassessment, with advocates arguing that honoring Jackson insults the descendants of those he enslaved and attempted to exterminate.[^154]

Historians increasingly argue that understanding Jackson requires centering the experiences of his victims—the thousands of Native Americans who died on removal trails, the hundreds of people he enslaved, and the democratic principles he violated.[^155] From this perspective, Jackson's legacy is primarily one of violence, racism, and the betrayal of America's founding ideals in pursuit of white supremacy and empire.[^156]
