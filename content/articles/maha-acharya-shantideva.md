## Summary

Shantideva was an Indian Buddhist monk and scholar at Nalanda University who composed the Bodhicaryavatara (Guide to the Bodhisattva Way of Life), one of the most beloved texts in all of Buddhism. His poetic treatment of compassion, patience, and wisdom has been central to Tibetan Buddhism. The Dalai Lama frequently teaches from this text. His chapter on patience is considered one of the greatest psychological analyses of anger in any tradition.
