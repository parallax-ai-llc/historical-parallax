## Summary

Kyai Haji Muhammad Hasyim Asy'ari (1871-1947) was one of Indonesia's most influential Islamic scholars and a designated National Hero who founded Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), the world's largest Islamic organization with over 90 million members.[^1] Born in Gedang, Jombang Regency, East Java, he established Pesantren Tebuireng in 1899, which became the largest Islamic boarding school in Java with 4,000 students by 1947.[^2] His most significant political contribution was issuing the Jihad Resolution on October 22, 1945, which mobilized millions of Muslims to defend Indonesian independence against Dutch colonial forces, directly contributing to the Battle of Surabaya.[^3] Descended from Javanese royalty and educated in Mecca under prominent scholars, Hasyim Asy'ari bridged traditional Islamic scholarship with nationalist resistance, leaving a lasting legacy through his descendants including President Abdurrahman Wahid and through the continued influence of NU in Indonesian society.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Muhammad Hasyim was born on February 14, 1871 (though some sources cite April 10, 1875) in Gedang, a village in Jombang Regency, East Java.[^5] He was the third child of Kyai Asy'ari and Halimah, both from prominent families deeply involved in pesantren (Islamic boarding school) administration.[^6] His family's educational lineage was remarkable: his grandfather, Kyai Usman, founded Gedang Pesantren, while his great-grandfather established Tambakberas Pesantren, creating a multigenerational tradition of Islamic education.[^7]

Hasyim Asy'ari's ancestry could be traced to Sultan Hadiwijaya of Pajang and further back to Brawijaya VI (Girindrawardhana), the last king of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire, connecting him to Java's pre-Islamic royal heritage.[^8] This aristocratic lineage gave him significant social capital and legitimacy among Javanese Muslims, who revered both Islamic scholarship and noble descent.

His early education followed the traditional pesantren system, where he studied under his father and other local kiai (Islamic scholars). From a young age, he demonstrated exceptional aptitude for memorizing classical Islamic texts and understanding complex theological concepts.[^9] His family environment emphasized both rigorous Islamic scholarship and the ethical responsibilities of religious leadership, values that would define his later work.

In 1892, at approximately 21 years of age, Hasyim Asy'ari embarked on the pilgrimage to Mecca, which would transform into an extended period of advanced Islamic study lasting several years.[^10] This journey to the heartland of Islam was both a spiritual obligation and an educational opportunity that separated ordinary religious students from future ulama of the highest caliber.

## Rise to Power

Hasyim Asy'ari's rise to prominence began during his extended studies in Mecca from 1892 onward, where he studied under some of the most distinguished Islamic scholars of his era.[^11] His principal teacher was Shaykh Mahfudz of Termas (Pacitan), who was the first Indonesian scholar to teach Sahih Bukhari (one of Islam's most authoritative hadith collections) in Mecca.[^12] He also studied under Ahmad Khatib al-Minangkabawi, who served as Imam at Masjid al-Haram and was a teacher to both modernist and traditionalist Indonesian scholars, including Ahmad Dahlan, the founder of Muhammadiyah.[^13]

Interestingly, despite their later organizational differences, Hasyim Asy'ari and Ahmad Dahlan were friends who studied under the same teachers in Mecca and even boarded with some of the same scholars, including Sholeh Darat from Semarang.[^14] This shared educational background would later manifest in different visions for Islamic reform in Indonesia—with Dahlan emphasizing modernist approaches and Hasyim Asy'ari championing traditionalist methods.

Upon returning to Java, Hasyim Asy'ari founded Pesantren Tebuireng in 1899 in Jombang, East Java.[^15] This institution was deliberately designed as a "pilot project" to improve pesantren educational standards while maintaining traditional Islamic teaching methods.[^16] Unlike many pesantren of the era, Tebuireng introduced systematic reforms: from 1899 to 1916, it used the traditional sorogan and bandongan teaching methods, but gradually incorporated extra-curricular courses including public speaking, Dutch, English, and typing—subjects unusual for traditional Islamic schools.[^17]

By the early 20th century, Pesantren Tebuireng had become the largest pesantren in Java, attracting thousands of students from across the Indonesian archipelago.[^18] Hasyim Asy'ari's reputation as both a master of classical Islamic sciences and an effective educational reformer spread throughout the Muslim community. His students became influential religious leaders themselves, extending his intellectual network across the region.

The critical moment in his organizational leadership came on January 31, 1926, when Hasyim Asy'ari and several traditional Islamic leaders founded Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), meaning "Awakening of the Ulama."[^19] NU was established as an organization for orthodox Ash'ari Muslims and scholars, explicitly positioned in contrast to the modernist policies of Muhammadiyah and PERSIS.[^20] The organization aimed to defend traditional Islamic scholarship, protect the interests of pesantren, and provide a unified voice for traditionalist Muslims in the rapidly changing landscape of colonial Indonesia.

## Major Achievements

**Founding of Pesantren Tebuireng (1899)**

Hasyim Asy'ari's establishment of Pesantren Tebuireng in 1899 represented a watershed moment in Indonesian Islamic education.[^21] The institution successfully balanced preservation of classical Islamic scholarship with pragmatic educational reforms. By 1947, it enrolled approximately 4,000 students, making it the largest pesantren in Java and a model for Islamic education throughout Indonesia.[^22] Tebuireng became the center for reform of traditional Islamic teaching, introducing systematic curriculum development while maintaining the spiritual and ethical foundations of pesantren education.[^23]

The educational philosophy at Tebuireng emphasized character formation (akhlaq), spirituality, and sincerity alongside intellectual mastery of Islamic sciences.[^24] This holistic approach contrasted with purely intellectual or modernist educational models, insisting that Islamic education must transform the whole person, not merely transmit information.

**Founding of Nahdlatul Ulama (1926)**

On January 31, 1926, Hasyim Asy'ari founded Nahdlatul Ulama together with KH. Wahab Chasbullah and other traditional Islamic leaders.[^25] This organization would become the world's largest Islamic organization, with current membership estimated at over 90 million, primarily in Indonesia.[^26] NU provided institutional structure and political representation for traditionalist Muslims who followed the madhhab (schools of Islamic jurisprudence) and respected classical Islamic scholarship.

NU defended the practice of taqlid (following established scholarly interpretations) and traditional Islamic practices that modernists often criticized, including visits to graves of saints, communal Quran recitations, and elaborate religious celebrations.[^27] Under Hasyim Asy'ari's leadership, NU established networks of pesantren, created standardized religious curricula, and advocated for traditional scholars' interests in the colonial bureaucracy.

**Prolific Scholarly Writings**

Hasyim Asy'ari was one of the most productive writing scholars of his time, producing works in both Arabic and Javanese on diverse subjects including aqidah (theology), fiqh (jurisprudence), hadith, tasawuf (mysticism), education, agriculture, social issues, and politics.[^28] His most influential work, "Adab al-'Alim wa al-Muta'allim" (Ethics of the Teacher and Student), completed on Sunday, 22 Jumada al-Tsani 1343 H, became a foundational text for Islamic education throughout Indonesia.[^29]

The book consists of 8 chapters covering the significance of education, the responsibilities and duties of students (including 12 ethics toward teachers and 13 ethics regarding study materials), and the responsibilities and duties of teachers (including 20 ethics for scholars toward themselves).[^30] It synthesized earlier classical works by Sheikh Muhammad bin Sahnun, Sheikh Burhanuddin az-Zarnuji, and Sheikh Ibn Jamaah, adapting their insights for the Indonesian context.[^31]

**The Jihad Resolution (1945)**

Hasyim Asy'ari's most consequential political act was issuing the Jihad Resolution on October 22, 1945, just eight weeks after Indonesia's proclamation of independence.[^32] The resolution declared that defending Indonesian independence was a religious obligation (fard) for Muslims, elevating nationalist struggle to the level of holy war.[^33] The resolution was issued together with KH. Wahab Chasbullah, KH. Abbas Abdul Jamil, KH. Wahid Hasyim (his son), and other scholars.[^34]

The Jihad Resolution contained five key principles: (1) Indonesia's independence proclaimed on August 17 must be defended; (2) The Republic of Indonesia as the only legitimate government must be guarded and helped; (3) The Netherlands returning with British help would use political and military means to recolonize Indonesia; (4) Muslims, especially NU members, must take up arms against Dutch colonizers and their allies; (5) This obligation constitutes jihad and is mandatory for every Muslim living within a 94-kilometer radius, while those living outside must provide material support.[^35]

The immediate impact was the Battle of Surabaya on November 10, 1945, where Indonesian fighters, inspired by the religious fatwa, engaged British and Dutch forces in one of the bloodiest battles of the Indonesian Revolution.[^36] The Jihad Resolution became a unifying force that transcended ethnic, cultural, and regional differences, galvanizing Indonesians from all walks of life to resist colonial re-occupation.[^37]

**National Hero Designation**

In recognition of his contributions to Indonesian independence and Islamic education, President Sukarno designated Hasyim Asy'ari as a National Hero on November 17, 1964, through Presidential Decree No. 24/1964.[^38] The designation acknowledged his major role in strengthening pesantren education and actively resisting colonizers.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

**Collaboration with Japanese Occupation (1942-1945)**

During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945), Hasyim Asy'ari served as chairman of Masyumi, the Islamic organization established by Japanese authorities.[^40] The Japanese decision to appoint Hasyim Asy'ari was based on political motivation—specifically to secure Muslim community support for Japanese efforts to fight Allied forces in the Pacific War.[^41] Japanese authorities sought to enlist both nationalist and Islamic leaders to secure popular acceptance of their rule, and Hasyim Asy'ari's participation in this wartime Masyumi became controversial.[^42]

Critics have questioned whether his chairmanship constituted collaboration with an occupying power. After independence, there was considerable debate about whether to retain the Masyumi name due to its association with Japanese occupiers.[^43] However, defenders note that many Indonesian leaders cooperated with Japanese authorities while secretly supporting independence, and that Hasyim Asy'ari was arrested by the Japanese for refusing to perform seikerei (bowing toward the rising sun as a symbol of respect to the Japanese Emperor), demonstrating his resistance to full collaboration.[^44]

**Traditionalist Resistance to Educational Modernization**

While Hasyim Asy'ari introduced some reforms at Pesantren Tebuireng, his educational philosophy emphasized preserving traditional methods and classical texts over wholesale modernization.[^45] Critics from modernist Islamic movements argued that this conservatism hindered Muslims' ability to compete in colonial and post-colonial economies that increasingly valued Western-style education and scientific knowledge.

The tension between Hasyim Asy'ari's traditionalist approach and Ahmad Dahlan's modernist Muhammadiyah reflected deeper debates about Islamic reform. Modernists criticized traditionalist practices such as grave visitation, elaborate religious ceremonies, and strict adherence to medieval jurisprudential schools as "backward" superstitions that needed purging.[^46] Hasyim Asy'ari's defense of these practices sometimes appeared to modernists as obstinate resistance to progress.

**Political Quietism Before Independence**

Some nationalist historians have noted that Hasyim Asy'ari and traditional ulama generally focused on religious and educational matters rather than explicitly anti-colonial political activism until the very end of Dutch rule.[^47] Unlike secular nationalists who faced imprisonment for political organizing in the 1920s and 1930s, traditional Islamic leaders often worked within colonial structures, serving on advisory councils and accepting government recognition of pesantren.

This political quietism changed dramatically with the Jihad Resolution of 1945, but critics suggest that earlier, more sustained political resistance might have accelerated Indonesian independence. Defenders counter that maintaining pesantren as centers of Islamic identity was itself a form of resistance that preserved Indonesian culture against colonial assimilation.

**Gender Segregation in Education**

Like most pesantren of his era, Tebuireng practiced strict gender segregation, and Hasyim Asy'ari's writings focused almost exclusively on male teachers and students.[^48] His educational philosophy, while progressive in some respects, maintained traditional gender hierarchies that limited women's access to advanced Islamic education. Modern critics note that this exclusion restricted women's religious authority and educational opportunities, though this criticism must be understood within the context of early 20th-century Indonesian society.

---

## Personal Life

Hasyim Asy'ari married seven times, and all of his wives were daughters of ulama, reflecting the strong network of scholarly families in traditional Islamic society.[^49] Four of his wives were named Khadijah, Nafisah, Nafiqah, and Masrurah.[^50] At age twenty, he married his first wife, Khadijah, the daughter of Pesantren Siwalan Panji's leader.[^51] Tragically, Khadijah died after only seven months of marriage, and their son Abdullah died two months later.[^52]

From his marriage to Nafiqah, he had a son named Wahid Hasyim (Abdul Wahid Hasyim), who would become one of the formulators of the Jakarta Charter—the document that shaped the philosophical basis of the Indonesian state—and later served as Minister of Religious Affairs.[^53] Wahid Hasyim married his cousin Solehah, and together they had six children: Abdurrahman Wahid, Aisyah Hamid Baidlowi, Salahuddin Wahid, Umar Wahid, Lily Chodijah Wahid, and Hasyim Wahid.[^54]

The most famous of Hasyim Asy'ari's grandchildren was Abdurrahman Wahid (known as Gus Dur), who became the fourth President of Indonesia (1999-2001) and a globally recognized advocate for religious pluralism and democracy.[^55] This illustrious lineage demonstrated how Hasyim Asy'ari's family continued to shape Indonesian politics and Islamic thought for generations after his death.

Hasyim Asy'ari was known among pesantren ulama as "Hadratussyekh" (The Grand Teacher or Master), a title reflecting the deep respect he commanded in traditionalist circles.[^56] Colleagues and students described him as deeply pious, methodical in his scholarship, and possessing exceptional memory for classical texts. He maintained a rigorous daily schedule of teaching, writing, and worship throughout his life.

His personality combined profound spirituality with practical organizational skills. While he mastered the contemplative dimensions of Islamic mysticism (tasawuf), he also effectively managed Pesantren Tebuireng and navigated complex political situations. This combination of spiritual depth and worldly competence made him an effective leader who could inspire both personal devotion and institutional loyalty.

## Legacy

**Institutional Legacy: Nahdlatul Ulama**

Hasyim Asy'ari's most enduring institutional legacy is Nahdlatul Ulama, which remains the world's largest Islamic organization with an estimated 90 million members, predominantly in Indonesia.[^57] NU has played a crucial role in Indonesian politics, religious life, and social development for nearly a century. The organization's commitment to moderate Islam, tolerance of local cultural practices, and rejection of religious extremism reflects principles Hasyim Asy'ari established.

NU's fundamental principles include adherence to Ash'ari theology, following one of the four Sunni legal schools (madhhab), and practicing Ghazalian Sufism—all representing Hasyim Asy'ari's traditionalist vision.[^58] The organization operates thousands of pesantren throughout Indonesia, educating millions of students in Islamic sciences and providing social services to rural communities.

**Educational Legacy: Pesantren System**

Pesantren Tebuireng continues to operate as one of Indonesia's premier Islamic educational institutions, and the model Hasyim Asy'ari developed has been replicated throughout the archipelago.[^59] His emphasis on combining classical Islamic scholarship with practical education, maintaining spiritual formation alongside intellectual development, and grounding education in ethical transformation rather than mere knowledge transmission continues to influence Indonesian Islamic education.[^60]

His book "Adab al-'Alim wa al-Muta'allim" remains a core text in pesantren curricula, shaping how teachers and students understand their mutual responsibilities and the ethical dimensions of education.[^61] Contemporary Islamic educators continue to study his works for insights on integrating traditional and modern educational approaches.

**Political Legacy: Islamic Nationalism**

Hasyim Asy'ari's Jihad Resolution of 1945 demonstrated that traditional Islamic scholars could provide powerful religious legitimation for nationalist political causes.[^62] His principle of "hubbul wathan minal iman" (love of homeland is part of faith) integrated Islamic identity with Indonesian nationalism, arguing that Muslims could be simultaneously devout and patriotic without contradiction.[^63]

This synthesis influenced how Indonesian Muslims understood the relationship between religion and state. Rather than advocating for an Islamic state or complete secularism, Hasyim Asy'ari's approach suggested that Islamic values could undergird a pluralistic nation-state—a vision his grandson Abdurrahman Wahid would later champion as President.

**Family Legacy: The Wahid Dynasty**

Through his descendants, particularly his son Wahid Hasyim and grandson Abdurrahman Wahid, Hasyim Asy'ari's influence extended directly into Indonesian national politics.[^64] The Wahid family became one of Indonesia's most prominent political dynasties, combining Islamic scholarship with political leadership. Abdurrahman Wahid's presidency (1999-2001) during Indonesia's democratic transition embodied many of his grandfather's values: religious devotion, intellectual openness, and commitment to national unity.

**Philosophical Legacy: Moderate Traditionalism**

Hasyim Asy'ari's moderate political thought has been recognized as a counter to radicalism in contemporary Indonesia.[^65] His emphasis on following established scholarly traditions, respecting diverse interpretations within Islamic law, and maintaining tolerance for local cultural practices provides an alternative to rigid, literalist interpretations of Islam. In an era of increasing religious polarization, his legacy offers resources for promoting religious moderation and pluralism.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

**Champion of Traditional Islamic Scholarship**

Scholars of Indonesian Islam consistently recognize Hasyim Asy'ari as a reformer who successfully revitalized traditional Islamic education without abandoning its foundations.[^66] His contributions to developing the pesantren system while maintaining classical Islamic scholarship are viewed as a significant achievement in preserving Islamic intellectual traditions during the colonial period. Research demonstrates his curriculum development efforts and extra-curricular innovations at Tebuireng represented thoughtful adaptation to modern conditions.[^67]

Academic studies emphasize his relevance for modern Islamic education, arguing that his integration of spiritual development with intellectual rigor offers valuable insights for contemporary educational challenges.[^68] His emphasis on ethics, character formation, and the relationship between teachers and students addresses dimensions often neglected in purely technical or rationalistic educational models.

**Nationalist Hero and Independence Fighter**

Indonesian nationalist historiography celebrates Hasyim Asy'ari as a national hero whose Jihad Resolution mobilized millions to defend independence.[^69] The historical role of Islamic boarding schools (pesantren) in Indonesia's journey to independence is inseparable from his leadership.[^70] His arrest by Japanese authorities for refusing seikerei demonstrates his principled resistance to foreign domination.[^71]

Historians note that his Jihad Resolution uniquely mobilized the santri (pesantren students) and rural Muslim population, complementing the urban nationalist movement led by secular intellectuals.[^72] Without religious legitimation of the independence struggle, the revolution might have lacked the mass participation necessary for success.

**Moderate Islamic Leader**

Contemporary scholars highlight Hasyim Asy'ari's moderate political thought and its relevance for countering extremism.[^73] His commitment to working within established scholarly traditions, respecting diverse interpretations, and avoiding takfir (declaring other Muslims as unbelievers) provides a model for religious tolerance. His teachings emphasize that intellectual disagreement should not cause division and hostility, as "that is a great evil that can destroy the building of society and close the door to goodness everywhere."[^74]

**Educational Innovator**

Recent scholarship recognizes Hasyim Asy'ari as an educational innovator who balanced tradition and adaptation.[^75] His introduction of extra-curricular subjects like Dutch, English, and typing while maintaining classical Islamic sciences demonstrated pragmatic flexibility. His codification of teaching ethics in "Adab al-'Alim wa al-Muta'allim" provided systematic guidelines that professionalized religious education.[^76]

### Negative Views

**Collaboration with Japanese Occupation**

Critics note Hasyim Asy'ari's service as chairman of the Japanese-sponsored Masyumi organization raises questions about collaboration with an occupying power.[^77] While defenders argue many Indonesian leaders cooperated superficially while supporting independence privately, the fact remains that his position provided legitimacy to Japanese rule. The debate over retaining the Masyumi name after independence reflected discomfort with its collaboration history.[^78]

**Conservatism and Resistance to Modernization**

Modernist Islamic critics argue Hasyim Asy'ari's traditionalism hindered Indonesian Muslims' development. His defense of practices like grave visitation, adherence to medieval jurisprudential schools, and emphasis on classical texts over modern sciences allegedly kept Muslims "backward" relative to Western-educated Indonesians.[^79] The contrast with Ahmad Dahlan's Muhammadiyah—which integrated Western-style schools with Islamic education—highlights this criticism.

Secular nationalists sometimes portrayed traditional ulama like Hasyim Asy'ari as obstacles to progress, preferring religious reform that emphasized rationalism and rejected "superstitious" practices. From this perspective, his educational reforms at Tebuireng were insufficiently radical to prepare Muslims for modern economic and political competition.

**Limited Gender Inclusion**

Feminist scholars note that Hasyim Asy'ari's educational philosophy and institutions largely excluded women or relegated them to subordinate roles.[^80] His writings on educational ethics focused almost exclusively on male scholars and students, reflecting and reinforcing patriarchal structures. While understandable in historical context, this exclusion limited women's access to religious authority and advanced Islamic education.

**Political Quietism Before 1945**

Some historians argue that traditional ulama, including Hasyim Asy'ari, were relatively quiescent politically until the final years of colonial rule.[^81] Unlike secular nationalists who organized opposition movements and faced imprisonment throughout the 1920s-1930s, religious leaders often worked within colonial structures. This pragmatic accommodation, while preserving Islamic institutions, may have delayed more radical anti-colonial resistance.

Critics suggest that had Hasyim Asy'ari mobilized mass Islamic resistance earlier, Indonesian independence might have been achieved sooner and with less violence. Defenders respond that preserving Islamic education and identity was itself a form of long-term resistance more sustainable than confrontational politics that invited colonial repression.
