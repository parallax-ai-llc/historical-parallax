## Overview

Aldrich Ames was a CIA counter-intelligence officer who became one of the most damaging mole in US history. Driven by greed (he needed money for his divorce and his new wife's lavish spending), he walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington D.C. in 1985 and offered secrets for cash. For nearly a decade, he sold the names of virtually every CIA asset operating within the Soviet Union. The KGB executed at least 10 of them. He was paid over $4.6 million, which he spent on a Jaguar, a luxury house, and designer clothes, all while driving a modest Volvo to work to blend in.

## "General Polyakov"

One of Ames's most tragic victims was **General Dmitri Polyakov**, the highest-ranking CIA mole in the Soviet military.
He had provided crucial info for 25 years.
Ames sold his name. Polyakov was arrested, tortured, and executed in 1988.

## The Capture (1994)

The CIA knew there was a mole (assets were disappearing).
They formed a special team (led by Sandra Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuille) to hunt the traitor.
**The Clue:** Ames had massive unexplained bank deposits.
**The Takedown:** The FBI arrested him in his Jaguar on the way to work.
When arrested, he said simply: *"You're making a big mistake! You must have the wrong man!"* (He later confessed quickly).
