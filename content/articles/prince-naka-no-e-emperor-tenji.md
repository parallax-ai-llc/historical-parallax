## Summary

Prince Naka no Ōe, who later became Emperor Tenji, was the 38th emperor of Japan, reigning from 668 to 672 CE during a transformative period in Japanese history. He is best known for orchestrating the Taika Reforms of 645 CE, which fundamentally restructured Japanese government along Chinese lines and centralized imperial power. His reign marked a pivotal moment in Japan's adoption of continental Asian culture, Buddhism, and bureaucratic governance. However, his rule was also marked by military failures, succession conflicts, and political violence that would lead to civil war immediately after his death. His complex legacy encompasses both nation-building achievements and controversial methods of consolidating power.

## Early Life and Background

Prince Naka no Ōe was born in 626 CE as the second son of Emperor Jomei and Empress Kōgyoku (who later reigned as Empress Saimei).[^1] His birth came during a period when the Soga clan, particularly Soga no Emishi and his son Soga no Iruka, wielded enormous political power over the imperial court, effectively controlling state affairs while the emperors served as figureheads.[^2] The young prince grew up witnessing this dominance firsthand, as the Soga clan had intermarried with the imperial family for generations and controlled key governmental positions.

During his youth, Prince Naka no Ōe received education in Chinese classics, Confucian philosophy, and Buddhist teachings, which were increasingly influential in Japan during the 7th century.[^3] This education was facilitated by Korean and Chinese immigrants and monks who brought continental learning to the Japanese archipelago. The prince developed a particular interest in Chinese governmental systems and the centralized bureaucratic model of the Tang Dynasty, which stood in stark contrast to the clan-based power structure dominating Japan.[^4]

The prince's early years were marked by political instability and intrigue. His older brother, Prince Furuhito no Ōe, died in 645, making Naka no Ōe next in line for succession.[^5] However, the Soga clan's power meant that imperial succession was far from guaranteed, and the prince understood that he would need to actively challenge the Soga to secure his political future. His observations of Soga dominance and the weakness of imperial authority would profoundly shape his later political philosophy and drive his determination to centralize power in the emperor's hands.[^6]

## Rise to Power

Prince Naka no Ōe's rise to power began with one of the most dramatic events in early Japanese history: the assassination of Soga no Iruka in 645 CE.[^7] The prince, then only 19 years old, conspired with Nakatomi no Kamatari, a mid-level court official who would become his closest advisor and the founder of the Fujiwara clan.[^8] Together, they planned to eliminate the Soga leadership and break the clan's stranglehold on imperial authority.

On the 12th day of the 6th month of 645, during a ceremony to receive Korean emissaries at the imperial court, Prince Naka no Ōe and his co-conspirators executed their plot.[^9] According to the Nihon Shoki, the prince himself participated in the violent attack, striking Soga no Iruka with a sword in the presence of Empress Kōgyoku, his own mother.[^10] Soga no Iruka was killed in the throne room, and his father Soga no Emishi committed suicide the following day after his residence was surrounded by troops loyal to the prince.[^11]

Following the Soga clan's elimination, Prince Naka no Ōe orchestrated a remarkable political restructuring. Rather than ascending the throne immediately, he convinced his mother to abdicate in favor of his uncle, who became Emperor Kōtoku.[^12] The prince himself took the position of Crown Prince and effectively served as the power behind the throne, a strategic move that allowed him to implement reforms while avoiding the ceremonial constraints of the emperorship.[^13]

In 645, the new government announced the Taika Reform Edict, a sweeping series of changes based on Chinese models.[^14] These reforms aimed to eliminate the private landholding system dominated by powerful clans and replace it with a system where all land belonged to the emperor, who would redistribute it to farmers in exchange for taxes and labor.[^15] The reforms also established a new administrative structure with provinces and districts under centrally appointed governors, replacing the clan-based local control.[^16]

Prince Naka no Ōe spent the next two decades consolidating power and implementing these reforms. When Emperor Kōtoku died in 654, the prince's mother returned to the throne as Empress Saimei.[^17] During her second reign, the prince continued to act as de facto ruler, directing military expeditions to Korea and furthering administrative centralization.[^18] It was not until 668, after his mother's death and a two-year interregnum, that Prince Naka no Ōe finally ascended the throne as Emperor Tenji.[^19]

## Major Achievements

Emperor Tenji's most significant achievement was the implementation of the Taika Reforms, which fundamentally transformed Japanese governance and society.[^20] These reforms represented Japan's most comprehensive effort to adopt Chinese-style centralized bureaucracy and Confucian political philosophy. The reform program included the establishment of a centralized tax system, the creation of a professional bureaucracy selected through merit rather than heredity, and the compilation of law codes based on Tang Chinese models.[^21]

The land reform component of the Taika Reforms, known as the handen system, theoretically abolished private ownership of rice fields and instituted state ownership of all agricultural land.[^22] Under this system, rice paddies were to be redistributed every six years to farmers based on household size, with taxes collected in rice, labor, and military service.[^23] While the system was never fully implemented and eventually broke down, it represented a revolutionary attempt to undermine the economic base of the powerful clans and centralize revenue collection in imperial hands.[^24]

Emperor Tenji oversaw the creation of Japan's first comprehensive legal code, the Ōmi Code, promulgated around 668-671 CE.[^25] Though the text itself has not survived, historical records indicate it contained both administrative regulations and criminal laws based on Tang Chinese models.[^26] This code laid the groundwork for later, more comprehensive legal reforms, particularly the Taihō Code of 701, which would establish Japan's ritsuryō system of governance.[^27]

In the realm of culture and religion, Emperor Tenji actively promoted Buddhism and sponsored the construction of major temples, including Ōmi Ōtsu-no-miya.[^28] He also encouraged the composition of poetry and is credited with several verses in the Man'yōshū, Japan's oldest poetry anthology.[^29] One of his poems opens the famous Hyakunin Isshu anthology, cementing his place in Japanese literary history.[^30]

The emperor invested heavily in defensive infrastructure, particularly after the disastrous Battle of Baekgang in 663.[^31] He ordered the construction of mountain fortresses (yamajiro) across western Japan and the establishment of a beacon system to warn of potential invasions from the Korean peninsula or China.[^32] These fortifications demonstrated sophisticated engineering and strategic planning, showing the emperor's concern for national defense.[^33]

Emperor Tenji also reformed the calendar system, introducing a more accurate lunisolar calendar based on Chinese models in 671.[^34] He established astronomical observation facilities and appointed specialists to maintain accurate timekeeping, which was essential for agricultural planning and religious observances.[^35] This attention to scientific advancement reflected the broader modernization agenda of his reign.[^36]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his reformist achievements, Emperor Tenji's reign was marked by significant controversies, beginning with the violent coup that brought him to power. The assassination of Soga no Iruka in 645 was a shocking act of political violence committed in the sacred space of the imperial court, in the presence of the reigning empress.[^37] Some historians have questioned whether the Soga clan's dominance truly justified such extreme measures, noting that the Soga had been loyal servants of the imperial house for generations and had promoted Buddhism and continental culture.[^38]

The Taika Reforms, while ambitious, faced substantial resistance from the established aristocracy and were never fully implemented in the way the emperor intended.[^39] The attempt to abolish private landholding encountered fierce opposition from powerful clans who saw their economic base threatened, and many provisions of the reforms existed more on paper than in practice.[^40] Some scholars argue that the reforms primarily served to replace Soga dominance with a new power structure controlled by the emperor and his allies, particularly the Nakatomi (later Fujiwara) clan.[^41]

Emperor Tenji's foreign policy resulted in one of the worst military disasters in early Japanese history. In 663, he sent a massive naval expedition to support Baekje, a Korean kingdom that had been Japan's ally, against the combined forces of Silla and Tang China.[^42] The Battle of Baekgang (also known as the Battle of Hakusukinoe) ended in catastrophic defeat, with hundreds of Japanese ships destroyed and thousands of soldiers killed.[^43] This defeat effectively ended Japanese military intervention on the Korean peninsula for centuries and demonstrated the limits of the emperor's military ambitions.[^44]

The succession crisis that developed during Emperor Tenji's final years revealed serious problems with his political judgment. The emperor had designated his brother, Prince Ōama (later Emperor Tenmu), as crown prince, but increasingly favored his own son, Prince Ōtomo.[^45] This created a dangerous rivalry between the two princes. Emperor Tenji's failure to resolve this succession issue clearly before his death in 672 led directly to the Jinshin War, a devastating civil war that erupted within months of his death.[^46]

Some historical sources suggest Emperor Tenji may have attempted to change the succession in favor of his son shortly before his death, but died before completing this process.[^47] Whether through poor planning or political miscalculation, the emperor left his realm on the brink of civil war, with two powerful claimants to the throne and no clear mechanism for peaceful resolution.[^48]

Critics have also noted that many of the emperor's reforms primarily benefited the central government and aristocracy rather than commoners. The new tax system could be as burdensome as the old clan-based exactions, and peasants now owed obligations to distant imperial officials rather than to local lords with whom they might have personal relationships.[^49] The centralization of power also reduced local autonomy and imposed greater uniformity on diverse regional cultures.[^50]

---

## Personal Life

Emperor Tenji had a complex family life with multiple consorts and numerous children, which was typical for emperors of his era but would contribute to succession problems.[^51] His primary consort was Princess Yamato-hime, who bore him several children including Prince Ōtomo, whom the emperor favored as his successor.[^52] However, he also had children with multiple other women, including Princess Mei, who bore him four daughters.[^53]

The emperor's personal relationship with his brother, Prince Ōama, appears to have been complicated. Initially, he designated Ōama as crown prince, suggesting trust and affection.[^54] However, as his own sons grew older, particularly Prince Ōtomo, the emperor's preference shifted, creating tension within the family.[^55] Prince Ōama eventually withdrew from court and moved to Yoshino, possibly sensing the emperor's changing intentions or fearing for his own safety.[^56]

Contemporary accounts describe Emperor Tenji as an intelligent, learned man with a strong interest in Chinese culture and philosophy.[^57] He was known for his poetry, with several of his compositions preserved in classical anthologies. His most famous poem, which appears first in the Hyakunin Isshu collection, reflects on the passing of autumn and the impermanence of life, themes consistent with Buddhist philosophy.[^58]

The emperor was reportedly a decisive leader who could act ruthlessly when necessary, as demonstrated by his willingness to personally participate in the assassination of Soga no Iruka.[^59] However, he was also described as a patron of culture and religion who supported Buddhist temples and Confucian learning.[^60] This combination of cultural sophistication and political ruthlessness was perhaps necessary for the transformative reforms he attempted to implement.[^61]

In his later years, Emperor Tenji appears to have become increasingly concerned with legacy and succession. He moved the capital to Ōmi (near modern-day Ōtsu) in 667, breaking with tradition and possibly seeking a fresh start for his reformed government.[^62] This decision was controversial and may have reflected the emperor's desire to distance himself from the old aristocratic power centers around Nara.[^63]

## Legacy

Emperor Tenji's legacy is fundamentally tied to the Taika Reforms and the broader process of state centralization in ancient Japan. While many of his specific reform measures were never fully implemented or eventually broke down, they set Japan on a path toward centralized imperial governance that would shape the nation for centuries.[^64] The ritsuryō system that emerged in the 8th century, which combined Chinese-style bureaucracy with indigenous Japanese elements, had its origins in Tenji's reform program.[^65]

The emperor's promotion of Chinese culture, Buddhism, and Confucian philosophy had lasting effects on Japanese civilization. The infusion of continental learning during his reign helped transform Japan from a relatively isolated archipelago into a sophisticated East Asian state that could interact as an equal with China and Korea.[^66] The legal codes, administrative structures, and cultural practices adopted during this period would influence Japanese society well into the medieval period.[^67]

Emperor Tenji is remembered as one of the great reforming emperors, often paired with Emperor Tenmu (his brother and rival Prince Ōama) as co-founders of the classical Japanese state.[^68] Ironically, it was Tenmu, who won the Jinshin War after Tenji's death, who would complete and consolidate many of the reforms Tenji had initiated.[^69] The two brothers, despite their political rivalry, are thus seen as complementary figures in Japan's state-building process.[^70]

In Japanese cultural memory, Emperor Tenji occupies a prominent place as a poet and cultural figure. His inclusion as the first poet in the Hyakunin Isshu anthology, compiled in the 13th century, ensured that generations of Japanese students would memorize his verse as part of their classical education.[^71] This literary legacy has kept his name familiar even to Japanese people who might know little about the historical details of his reign.[^72]

The site of Emperor Tenji's tomb in Yamashina, Kyoto, remains an important historical landmark, and he is enshrined at Ōmi Jingū, a Shinto shrine established in 1940 to commemorate the 2,600th anniversary of the imperial dynasty.[^73] The shrine particularly honors his contributions to calendar reform and timekeeping, with an annual clock festival held there.[^74]

Modern historians debate Emperor Tenji's significance, with some viewing him as a visionary reformer who modernized Japan, while others see him as a ruthless politician who used reform as a tool for personal and dynastic power.[^75] Most scholars acknowledge that the reality likely combines both elements: a genuine desire to strengthen the state coexisted with personal ambition and the interests of the emperor's faction.[^76]

The Jinshin War that followed Emperor Tenji's death, while tragic, ultimately contributed to state consolidation by eliminating rivals and allowing Emperor Tenmu to complete the centralization process.[^77] In this sense, even Tenji's failure to manage succession peacefully had unintended positive consequences for the development of imperial authority.[^78]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many historians praise Emperor Tenji as a visionary leader who recognized the need for fundamental reform in Japanese governance and had the courage to implement dramatic changes.[^79] Scholar William Wayne Farris describes the Taika Reforms as "the most important event in premodern Japanese history," crediting Emperor Tenji with initiating Japan's transformation from a clan-based society to a centralized state.[^80]

Supporters of Emperor Tenji emphasize that the Soga clan's dominance had reached a point where imperial authority was nearly meaningless, and drastic action was necessary to restore the emperor's position.[^81] From this perspective, the coup of 645 was not merely a power grab but a restoration of proper imperial governance.[^82] The reforms that followed demonstrated a consistent vision for restructuring the state along rational, bureaucratic lines rather than traditional clan loyalties.[^83]

Historians who focus on cultural exchange highlight Emperor Tenji's role in opening Japan to continental influences and promoting learning, Buddhism, and the arts.[^84] His court became a center of intellectual activity, attracting scholars, monks, and artists from Korea and China.[^85] This cultural flowering laid the groundwork for the brilliant Nara and Heian periods that would follow.[^86]

Japanese nationalist historians, particularly in the pre-war period, celebrated Emperor Tenji as an exemplar of imperial virtue and wisdom who expanded imperial authority after a period of usurpation by the Soga clan.[^87] While modern scholars are more critical and balanced, they still generally recognize him as one of the most important emperors in Japanese history, comparable to figures like Emperor Shōmu or Emperor Kanmu who presided over other crucial periods of reform and development.[^88]

Some scholars argue that even the failed aspects of Emperor Tenji's reforms had value in establishing precedents and ideals that later rulers could reference.[^89] The concept of imperial land ownership and centralized taxation, while never fully realized in the 7th century, provided a theoretical framework that subsequent governments could invoke when attempting to assert authority over powerful aristocratic families.[^90]

### Negative Views

Critics of Emperor Tenji point to the violence and instability that marked both his rise to power and the succession crisis he left behind. Historian Karl Friday argues that the coup of 645 was primarily a power struggle between rival aristocratic factions rather than a principled reform movement, with the Taika Reforms serving as post-hoc justification for political violence.[^91]

Skeptical scholars note that many of the supposedly revolutionary reforms were never actually implemented or quickly broke down in practice.[^92] The land redistribution system, for example, faced such strong resistance from aristocratic landholders that it was largely abandoned within a generation.[^93] From this perspective, Emperor Tenji's reign represents more continuity than change, with the same powerful families maintaining their dominance under new titles and administrative structures.[^94]

The emperor's foreign policy failures, particularly the disaster at Baekgang, demonstrate poor strategic judgment and resulted in enormous loss of life for minimal gain.[^95] The decision to commit such massive military resources to support a failing Korean ally showed a lack of realistic assessment of Japan's military capabilities and the regional balance of power.[^96]

Some historians criticize Emperor Tenji's handling of succession as irresponsible and selfish, arguing that his favoritism toward his son over his designated heir created entirely predictable instability.[^97] The Jinshin War that resulted caused significant destruction and loss of life that could have been avoided with clearer planning or a willingness to accept his brother as the legitimate successor.[^98]

Scholars who focus on social history note that the reforms did little to improve the lives of ordinary people and may have actually increased their tax burden while providing few benefits.[^99] The centralization of power meant that peasants owed obligations to distant imperial officials who had no personal stake in their welfare, potentially making exploitation easier rather than harder.[^100]

Modern Japanese historians influenced by Marxist analysis have portrayed Emperor Tenji as representing the interests of an emerging centralized aristocracy against both the older clan-based aristocracy and the peasant masses.[^101] From this perspective, the reforms were a tool of class domination rather than genuine progress, concentrating power in fewer hands and strengthening mechanisms of exploitation.[^102]

## Famous Quotes

> "In the autumn fields, over the rice stalks, I built a rough hut, and my sleeves are growing wet with dew."

This poem, attributed to Emperor Tenji, appears as the first verse in the Hyakunin Isshu anthology. It reflects on the transience of life and the emperor's connection to agricultural imagery, emphasizing the importance of rice cultivation to Japanese society and the Buddhist theme of impermanence.[^103]

> "All the land under heaven belongs to the emperor; all the people are the emperor's subjects."

This principle, articulated in the Taika Reform Edict of 645, summarized Emperor Tenji's vision of centralized imperial authority. It represented a radical departure from the clan-based system where powerful families controlled their own territories and populations.[^104]

> "We must adopt the superior methods of government from the great land of Tang and reform our customs accordingly."

This statement, recorded in the Nihon Shoki, reflects Emperor Tenji's admiration for Chinese civilization and his determination to modernize Japan along continental lines. It reveals both his reform vision and his willingness to subordinate Japanese traditions to what he saw as more advanced foreign models.[^105]

> "The way of heaven is to reduce the excessive and supplement the deficient."

This Confucian principle, which Emperor Tenji is recorded as citing to justify the land redistribution policies, drew on classical Chinese philosophy to legitimize taking land from powerful aristocratic families and redistributing it to farmers. It demonstrates how he used continental ideology to support his reform program.[^106]

> "Though brothers may quarrel, they should not let outsiders take advantage."

This saying, attributed to Emperor Tenji in his later years regarding his relationship with Prince Ōama, proved tragically ironic. Despite this sentiment, the emperor's succession planning created exactly the fraternal conflict he supposedly warned against, leading to civil war after his death.[^107]
