## Summary

Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (1828-1910) was a Russian writer widely regarded as one of the greatest novelists in history. His epic novels *War and Peace* (1869) and *Anna Karenina* (1877) are considered pinnacles of realist fiction, combining vast historical sweep with psychological insight. A wealthy aristocrat who became an ascetic moralist, Tolstoy later rejected organized religion, embraced nonviolent resistance, and influenced Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. His spiritual crisis, documented in *A Confession*, led him to develop a Christian anarchist philosophy emphasizing love, simplicity, and nonviolence. Excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church, Tolstoy died at a remote train station, fleeing his estate in spiritual turmoil.
