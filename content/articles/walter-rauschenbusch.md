## Summary

Walter Rauschenbusch was an American Baptist theologian who was the leading figure of the Social Gospel movement. His books Christianity and the Social Crisis and A Theology for the Social Gospel argued that Christianity demanded systemic social reform, not just individual salvation. He served as pastor in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of New York before becoming a professor. His ideas profoundly influenced Martin Luther King Jr. and subsequent liberation theology.
