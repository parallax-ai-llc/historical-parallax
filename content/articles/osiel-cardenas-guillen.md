## Summary
Osiel Cárdenas Guillén was the leader of the Gulf Cartel and founder of Los Zetas, originally a paramilitary enforcement arm made up of former Mexican special forces soldiers. His creation of Los Zetas transformed Mexican cartel violence to military-scale warfare.

## Early Life
Born May 18, 1967, in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. He was a mechanic and small-time drug dealer who rose through the Gulf Cartel. He killed his rival Salvador Gómez Herrera to take control. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Cárdenas Guillén transformed the Gulf Cartel by recruiting elite Mexican Army special forces deserters (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales - GAFE) as his private army, which became Los Zetas. He famously confronted DEA agents at gunpoint in 1999. His cartel controlled drug trafficking along the Gulf Coast. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
He was arrested on March 14, 2003, in Matamoros by the Mexican military. He was extradited to the US in 2007. In 2010, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison after cooperating with prosecutors. His arrest triggered a power struggle that split the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas into warring factions. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His cooperation provided valuable intelligence on cartel operations [^4]
- His arrest weakened the Gulf Cartel significantly
- His case demonstrated the value of extradition as a law enforcement tool

## Negative Perspectives
- Created Los Zetas, one of the most violent organizations in Mexican history [^5]
- Militarized cartel operations, escalating violence dramatically
- Confronted US DEA agents, threatening to kill them
- His arrest led to a violent power struggle causing thousands of deaths
- Corrupted Mexican military and government
