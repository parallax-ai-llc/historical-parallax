## Summary

Georges Lemaître was a Belgian Catholic priest, theoretical physicist, and astronomer who first proposed the theory of the expanding universe and the Big Bang. He derived Hubble's law two years before Edwin Hubble's observations and proposed the 'primeval atom' hypothesis, now known as the Big Bang theory. His work bridged faith and science in a remarkable way. Lemaître is considered the father of Big Bang cosmology.
