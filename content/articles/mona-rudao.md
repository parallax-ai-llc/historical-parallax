## Summary

Mona Rudao (1880–1930) was a paramount chief of the Seediq tribe in central Taiwan who led the Wushe Incident of October 1930, the last major indigenous uprising against Japanese colonial rule. Born into a hereditary chieftainship in Mahebo village, he succeeded his father Rudao Bai and became one of the most influential leaders in the mountainous Wushe region. In response to decades of forced labor, cultural suppression, and police brutality under Japanese occupation, Mona Rudao mobilized over 300 Seediq warriors to attack Japanese colonial authorities, killing 134 Japanese civilians and officials. The uprising was brutally suppressed with overwhelming military force, chemical weapons, and internecine indigenous warfare, leading to the deaths of over 600 Seediq people. Mona Rudao committed suicide during the conflict to avoid capture, and his legacy has evolved from colonial-era rebel to post-war symbol of indigenous resistance and Taiwanese national identity.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Mona Rudao was born around 1880 in Mahebo village, part of the Wushe region in central Taiwan's mountainous interior, which is now part of Nantou County.[^3] He was the eldest son of Rudao Bai (also known as Bai Rudao), a prominent hereditary chieftain of the Mahebo clan.[^4] The Seediq people to whom Mona Rudao belonged were part of the Austronesian indigenous peoples of Taiwan, specifically from the Tgdaya subgroup of the Seediq nation.[^5] His upbringing was steeped in the traditional Seediq cultural framework known as *gaya*, a comprehensive moral and social code that governed all aspects of tribal life, including hunting, headhunting, weaving, and spiritual beliefs about the afterlife.[^6]

As the hereditary successor to his father's chieftainship, Mona Rudao received training in leadership, warfare, hunting, and negotiation from a young age.[^7] The Seediq culture placed great emphasis on facial tattoos as markers of adulthood and spiritual worthiness—men earned tattoos by successfully taking heads in battle, while women earned them through mastery of weaving.[^8] According to Seediq beliefs, only those with facial tattoos and bloodied hands could cross the rainbow bridge (*hakaw utux*) to reach the ancestral hunting grounds after death.[^9] This spiritual framework would later inform Mona Rudao's willingness to launch a seemingly hopeless uprising against Japanese colonial power.

Mona Rudao succeeded his father as chief of Mahebo village and gradually extended his influence across multiple Seediq villages in the Wushe area, becoming one of the region's most powerful leaders by the early 20th century.[^10] His favored background and abilities helped him become one of only six indigenous Taiwanese to graduate from "normal" school under Japanese colonial rule, giving him a rare level of formal education for an indigenous leader of his era.[^11] He married a woman named Bakan and had at least three children: sons Tado Mona and Baso Mona, and daughter Mahung Mona.[^12] His position as a hereditary chief positioned him for responsibilities including village defense, resource allocation, and negotiations with outside powers—first with Qing Chinese authorities, and later with the Japanese colonial administration that arrived in Taiwan in 1895.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Mona Rudao's rise to prominence occurred during a tumultuous period of Taiwan's history marked by the transition from Qing Chinese to Japanese colonial rule. Following Japan's acquisition of Taiwan through the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, Japanese authorities launched a systematic campaign to subjugate Taiwan's indigenous peoples, whom they classified into categories of "raw savages" (untamed) and "cooked savages" (assimilated).[^14] The Seediq territories in the mountainous interior remained largely autonomous until 1906, when Japanese forces finally entered the Wushe region.[^15]

During the initial phase of Japanese occupation, one of the major conflicts involved the confiscation of all rifles from the Seediq tribes, weapons that were crucial to their traditional hunting way of life and cultural practices.[^16] Mona Rudao initially adopted a pragmatic approach to Japanese colonial rule, recognizing the overwhelming military superiority of the colonizers. He served as a "supported chief" under the Japanese administrative system, which co-opted indigenous leadership structures to facilitate colonial governance.[^17] This collaboration gave him access to Japanese education and privileges unavailable to most indigenous people.

In August 1911, Mona Rudao was selected as one of 43 indigenous leaders to participate in a carefully orchestrated one-month tour of Japan.[^18] The colonial authorities organized these tours to demonstrate Japanese military and industrial power, hoping to impress indigenous chiefs and ensure their continued compliance with colonial policies.[^19] During this visit, Mona Rudao and other Seediq chiefs toured major Japanese cities and military facilities, witnessing firsthand the technological and organizational capabilities of the empire that now ruled their homeland.[^20] The experience profoundly affected Mona Rudao's understanding of Japanese power, making him acutely aware of the vast military disparity between his people and the colonial state.

Despite his collaboration and understanding of Japanese strength, Mona Rudao never fully accepted colonial rule. Japanese colonial reports from the Taishō era noted that he "repeatedly planned an anti-Japanese uprising due to his antipathy towards Japan, but then quit after being caught by the local authorities."[^21] This suggests a pattern of resistance that predated the 1930 uprising by many years, indicating that Mona Rudao's opposition to Japanese rule was deep-seated rather than impulsive. His position as a powerful chief gave him both the authority to mobilize warriors and the strategic perspective to recognize when conditions might favor resistance.

By the late 1920s, conditions in Wushe had deteriorated significantly. The Seediq people faced increasing forced labor obligations, mandatory participation in infrastructure projects, restrictions on traditional hunting and farming practices, cultural suppression including bans on facial tattooing and tooth filing, wage discrimination, and widespread police misconduct.[^22] These accumulated grievances created a volatile situation that Mona Rudao would eventually harness into organized resistance. His influence had grown to encompass not just Mahebo village but multiple settlements across the Wushe region, making him the preeminent indigenous leader capable of coordinating a multi-village uprising.[^23]

## Major Achievements

Mona Rudao's most significant achievement was the planning and execution of the Wushe Incident on October 27, 1930, which became the last major indigenous uprising against Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan and one of the most dramatic acts of anti-colonial resistance in East Asian history.[^24] The uprising demonstrated remarkable strategic planning, coordination across multiple tribal villages, and a willingness to sacrifice everything in defense of indigenous culture and dignity.

The immediate trigger for the uprising occurred when a young Seediq man was beaten by Japanese police, igniting long-standing grievances that Mona Rudao had carefully cultivated into organized resistance.[^25] Recognizing that this moment presented an opportunity to strike against decades of accumulated injustices, Mona Rudao mobilized warriors from six Seediq tribal villages (out of eleven in the Wushe area), coordinating what would become a multi-pronged assault on Japanese colonial installations.[^26]

On the morning of October 27, 1930, Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in a carefully coordinated attack.[^27] The plan involved two primary objectives: first, raids on strategic police substations to capture weapons and ammunition, and second, a mass assault on a school athletic competition where Japanese officials, teachers, students, and families had gathered.[^28] The timing was deliberate—the athletic meet brought together a concentrated population of Japanese civilians and colonial administrators in a location where the Seediq warriors could achieve maximum impact.

At 8:00 AM, as attendees at Wushe Elementary School sang the Japanese national anthem during a flag-raising ceremony, the attack commenced.[^29] A young sword-wielding Seediq warrior vaulted the wall and rushed onto the playing field, followed by hundreds of others.[^30] The assault was devastating: a total of 134 Japanese people were killed, including women and children, along with two Han Taiwanese who were mistakenly killed due to wearing Japanese clothing.[^31] The uprising represented a profound violation of Japanese colonial authority in what had been regarded as one of the most "enlightened and compliant" of Taiwan's indigenous territories.[^32]

Beyond the immediate military action, Mona Rudao's achievement lay in his ability to mobilize and coordinate resistance across traditional village boundaries. The Seediq social structure was based on autonomous village communities, and convincing multiple chiefs and their warriors to participate in a coordinated uprising against overwhelming Japanese power required exceptional leadership and persuasive ability.[^33] His success in this regard demonstrated both his personal authority and the depth of resentment toward Japanese colonial policies throughout Seediq territories.

The uprising also achieved a significant symbolic victory by forcing Japanese colonial authorities to recognize the fundamental failures of their indigenous policies. The colonial power's inability to prevent the massacre in what they considered a successfully pacified region provoked widespread fear of similar nationalist movements potentially emerging in Taiwan, Korea, and even within Japan itself.[^34] Governor General Ishizuka Eizō and his chief civil administrator Hitomi Jirō were forced to resign in January 1931 due to internal and external criticism of their handling of the incident.[^35]

Furthermore, the Wushe Incident led to substantial policy changes in how Japanese authorities treated indigenous peoples in Taiwan. Aboriginals came to be seen as imperial subjects on equal footing with other ethnic groups rather than as "raw savages," and were upgraded in status to *takasagozoku* (高砂族; "tribal peoples of Taiwan").[^36] While these changes came too late for Mona Rudao and his people, they represented a meaningful shift in colonial policy that improved conditions for other indigenous groups across Taiwan.

From a cultural perspective, Mona Rudao's leadership during the uprising embodied the Seediq concept of *Seediq Bale* ("real men")—warriors who lived and died according to the principles of *gaya*, the ancestral moral code.[^37] By choosing to fight rather than submit to cultural extinction, Mona Rudao and his warriors demonstrated their commitment to Seediq identity and their belief that a meaningful death in defense of tradition was preferable to gradual cultural annihilation under colonial rule.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The Wushe Incident and Mona Rudao's leadership remain subjects of significant controversy, with debates surrounding the violence against civilians, strategic judgment, consequences for the Seediq people, and competing historical narratives about his motivations and character.

The most immediate moral controversy centers on the killing of 134 Japanese civilians, including women and children, during the October 27 attack.[^38] From a humanitarian perspective, the deliberate targeting of non-combatants at a school athletic event violated modern ethical standards for armed resistance. Critics argue that these deaths cannot be justified regardless of the grievances motivating the uprising, and that Mona Rudao bears responsibility for authorizing or failing to prevent attacks on civilians. The killing of two Han Taiwanese children who were mistakenly identified as Japanese due to their clothing further underscores the indiscriminate nature of the violence.[^39]

Japanese colonial reports portrayed Mona Rudao negatively, attributing the uprising's initiation to his "personal ambitions and recalcitrant character."[^40] These accounts describe his leadership as driven by "haughty resistance rather than a unified strategic vision," reflecting administrative perspectives that localized blame on individual character flaws rather than systemic colonial oppression.[^41] While these colonial-era assessments must be understood as propaganda designed to delegitimize indigenous resistance, they raise questions about the extent to which personal motivations versus collective grievances drove the uprising.

From a strategic standpoint, Mona Rudao's decision to launch an uprising against overwhelming Japanese military power has been criticized as militarily hopeless and ultimately catastrophic for the Seediq people. Having toured Japan in 1911 and witnessed Japanese military capabilities firsthand, Mona Rudao understood the vast disparity in resources and technology between his warriors and the colonial military.[^42] Critics argue that launching a revolt destined for military failure constituted a reckless decision that condemned his people to destruction.

The Japanese response to the uprising was brutally disproportionate. Governor General Ishizuka Eizō ordered a counter-offensive involving two thousand troops, forcing Seediq fighters to retreat into the mountains.[^43] The colonial military employed overwhelming force including artillery, aerial bombardment, and—most controversially—chemical weapons. Japan's army air corps dropped what were allegedly mustard gas bombs, representing possibly the first use of chemical warfare in Asia.[^44] However, historians debate the exact nature of these weapons, with some sources suggesting chloracetophenone (CN) tear gas was used rather than lethal blistering agents.[^45] Documentary evidence including a telegram from the Taiwan army commander to the Japanese Army Minister dated November 3, 1930, contains a request for blistering agents, indicating intent to use prohibited weapons against indigenous civilians.[^46]

Of the approximately 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, with 290 committing suicide to avoid dishonor according to traditional warrior codes.[^47] The devastation extended beyond the immediate participants: after the initial uprising was suppressed, the Japanese orchestrated what became known as the Second Wushe Incident on April 25, 1931.[^48] Colonial authorities tacitly allowed the Toda tribe—traditional rivals of the Tgdaya Seediq who had participated in the uprising—to attack survivors who had surrendered and been confined to protective custody.[^49] This orchestrated internecine violence killed 216 more Seediq people, with all remaining males over the age of 15 being systematically murdered.[^50]

The catastrophic human cost raises legitimate questions about whether Mona Rudao's leadership served the long-term interests of his people. The surviving Seediq were forcibly relocated to Kawanakajima Village, where Japanese authorities subjected them to intensive surveillance and cultural suppression, calling roll twice daily and banning all traditional activities in an effort to transform them into a "modern and civilized" rice farming community.[^51] These survivors and their descendants lived with the trauma and material consequences of the uprising for generations.

Another controversy involves the treatment of Mona Rudao's remains after his death. Following his suicide during the revolt, his body remained undiscovered until 1933, when it was found in a mountain forest.[^52] Rather than allowing proper burial according to Seediq traditions, Japanese colonial authorities transported his remains to the Department of Archaeology of Taihoku Imperial University (now National Taiwan University), where they were exhibited "as a warning to future rebels."[^53] The skeleton was kept "as if an animal specimen" to send a message about the consequences of resistance.[^54] This treatment of Mona Rudao's remains represents a profound violation of indigenous dignity and spiritual beliefs, compounding the violence of colonial suppression with desecration of the dead.

The remains were not properly buried until decades later, with conflicting accounts suggesting reburials in both 1974 (when they were moved to a warehouse and then to a location near Kawanakajima tribe at the Wushe Incident Memorial Park) and 1981 (when Mona Rudao was reportedly "finally given a proper burial").[^55] The prolonged controversy over his remains highlights broader issues of colonial violence extending beyond physical warfare to include symbolic and spiritual domination.

Contemporary debates about Mona Rudao also reflect tensions in how different groups interpret his legacy. Some critics argue that romanticizing his resistance obscures the human costs and moral complexities of the violence, potentially glorifying tactics that would be considered terrorism in modern contexts. Others contend that imposing contemporary ethical frameworks on colonial-era resistance movements fails to account for the extreme conditions and limited options available to colonized peoples facing cultural extinction.

## Personal Life

Details about Mona Rudao's personal life are limited by the oral traditions of Seediq society, which emphasized patrilineal clan descent over extensive written documentation, and by the traumatic destruction of his family during and after the uprising.[^56] What is known paints a picture of a man deeply embedded in traditional Seediq culture while simultaneously navigating the complexities of colonial power.

Mona Rudao married a woman named Bakan, whose name was revealed through the naming practices of their daughter's descendants.[^57] Together they had at least three children: sons Tado Mona and Baso Mona (also recorded as Bassao Mona), and daughter Mahung Mona.[^58] In Seediq naming conventions, children's names incorporated their father's given name, hence "Tado Mona" and "Mahung Mona" identified them as children of Mona (Rudao being his father's name in his own designation "Mona Rudao").

The tragedy that befell Mona Rudao's family during and after the Wushe Incident exemplifies the catastrophic human cost of the uprising. His son Tado Mona actively participated in the resistance and refused to surrender when Japanese forces overwhelmed the Seediq fighters. Along with four companions, Tado Mona committed suicide rather than face capture, embodying the warrior ethos central to Seediq identity.[^59] This act was consistent with the cultural belief that warriors should die with honor rather than submit to enemies, allowing them to cross the rainbow bridge to the ancestral hunting grounds in the afterlife.

Mona Rudao's daughter Mahung Mona became known posthumously as "the woman who washed her face with tears," a poignant epithet that captures the scale of her losses.[^60] All members of her immediate family died as a result of the Wushe Incident, including her parents (Mona Rudao and Bakan), her brothers (Tado Mona and presumably Baso Mona), her first husband Sapu Pawan, and their children.[^61] Near the end of the rebellion, facing Japanese retribution, Mahung and Sapu Pawan made the horrific decision to kill their young children by throwing them off a cliff before taking their own lives, choosing death over the shame and suffering they anticipated under Japanese revenge.[^62] Mahung survived this tragedy, though the sources do not explain how, and later adopted grandchildren whom she named Mona Pawan (after her father) and Bakan Pawan (after her mother), preserving their memory through naming practices.[^63]

As a leader, Mona Rudao's personality appears to have combined traditional Seediq warrior values with pragmatic political calculation. The 2011 film *Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale* portrayed him as "a calm, authoritative and mature Seediq Tgdaya village chief of Mahebu" who "lived under Japanese rule for 30 years and had been to Japan" and "understands Japan's power, but thinks it brings Seediq people no good, and insists on maintaining their own culture."[^64] While this is a cinematic interpretation, it aligns with historical evidence suggesting Mona Rudao was neither a reckless hothead nor a passive collaborator, but rather a leader who carefully weighed the costs and benefits of resistance over many years.

His 1911 visit to Japan and his education in Japanese colonial schools gave Mona Rudao unusual exposure to the colonizers' world, creating an internal tension between cultural knowledge and cultural loyalty. Unlike many indigenous leaders who had limited understanding of Japanese capabilities, Mona Rudao made his decision to resist with full knowledge of the likely military outcome, suggesting that preserving Seediq cultural identity and the principles of *gaya* held greater value for him than survival under conditions of cultural extinction.

Limited historical records suggest that Mona Rudao maintained strong connections to Seediq spiritual beliefs and practices. The concept of *gaya* governed all aspects of traditional Seediq life, and resistance to Japanese attempts to eradicate these practices—including bans on headhunting, facial tattooing, and traditional ceremonies—represented a fundamental defense of Seediq identity and spiritual integrity.[^65] For Mona Rudao and his generation, the ability to live according to *gaya* and thereby ensure passage across the rainbow bridge after death was not a negotiable cultural preference but an essential component of human dignity and cosmic order.

His decision to commit suicide by shooting himself with a pistol during the revolt, rather than allowing Japanese forces to capture him alive, was consistent with Seediq warrior traditions and his leadership responsibilities.[^66] This final act ensured that he would not be paraded as a captive or used for Japanese propaganda purposes, and demonstrated his commitment to the warrior ethos he had asked his people to embrace.

## Legacy

Mona Rudao's legacy has undergone remarkable transformation from colonial-era rebel to post-war symbol of indigenous resistance and Taiwanese national identity, reflecting broader shifts in how Taiwan understands its own history and relationship to colonialism, indigenous peoples, and national sovereignty.

In the immediate aftermath of the Wushe Incident, Japanese colonial authorities attempted to portray Mona Rudao as a dangerous criminal and cautionary example of the consequences of resisting imperial rule. The exhibition of his skeletal remains at Taihoku Imperial University served this propaganda function, warning other indigenous groups against similar uprisings.[^67] However, this narrative failed to suppress indigenous memory of the uprising as a heroic act of cultural defense, and the brutal Japanese response—particularly the use of chemical weapons and orchestration of internecine indigenous violence—undermined the legitimacy of colonial governance.

Following Taiwan's retrocession to Republic of China control in 1945, Mona Rudao's image began a gradual rehabilitation within Taiwanese nationalist narratives.[^68] The Kuomintang government, seeking to consolidate its authority and construct a narrative of liberation from Japanese imperialism, reframed indigenous resistance against Japanese colonialism as part of a broader anti-Japanese struggle that aligned with Chinese nationalist ideology. In 2005, the Kuomintang displayed a massive photo of Mona Rudao at its headquarters in honor of the 60th anniversary of Taiwan Retrocession Day, explicitly connecting his resistance to narratives of Taiwan's return to Chinese sovereignty.[^69]

However, this appropriation of Mona Rudao's legacy for Chinese nationalist purposes has itself become controversial as Taiwan's political identity has evolved. Contemporary Taiwanese indigenous rights activists emphasize that the Wushe Incident represented Seediq resistance to all forms of colonialism—whether Japanese, Chinese, or any other external power imposing governance on indigenous peoples without their consent.[^70] From this perspective, Mona Rudao's legacy belongs primarily to indigenous peoples' ongoing struggles for autonomy, cultural preservation, and self-determination rather than to competing nationalist narratives.

The most visible symbol of Mona Rudao's incorporation into Taiwanese national identity is his depiction on currency. Between 2001 and 2018, Taiwan issued a bi-metallic 20 New Taiwan Dollar coin featuring Mona Rudao's portrait on the obverse, with the reverse showing three boats of the Yami tribe, emphasizing the interconnectedness of Taiwan's diverse indigenous peoples.[^71] This numismatic honor places Mona Rudao among the most celebrated figures in Taiwanese history, accessible to millions of citizens through everyday economic transactions. The coin's design represents an official recognition that indigenous resistance to colonialism forms a legitimate and honored part of Taiwan's national story.[^72]

The 2011 film *Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale*, directed by Wei Te-sheng, had an enormous impact on popular understanding of Mona Rudao and the Wushe Incident.[^73] As the most expensive film ever produced in Taiwan, released in two parts running over four and a half hours (later edited to approximately two and a half hours for international release), the film brought the story to audiences across Taiwan and internationally.[^74] The film portrayed Mona Rudao as a tragic hero embodying *Seediq Bale*—the ideal of the "real man" who lives and dies according to the moral code of *gaya*.[^75] While critics have debated the film's historical accuracy and its romanticization of violence, it undeniably elevated Mona Rudao from a relatively obscure historical figure to a widely recognized symbol of resistance and indigenous dignity.

The film's impact extended beyond entertainment to spark renewed interest in indigenous history, culture, and contemporary rights issues. It contributed to broader public discussions about the treatment of indigenous peoples in Taiwan, the legacy of Japanese colonialism, and the ongoing challenges faced by indigenous communities in preserving their cultures and asserting their rights.[^76] Educational institutions, museums, and cultural organizations developed materials and programs related to the Wushe Incident, ensuring that new generations of Taiwanese citizens would encounter this history as part of their understanding of national identity.

For the Seediq people specifically, Mona Rudao's legacy remains deeply meaningful and complex. The uprising represents the zenith of Seediq resistance to colonial power and a defining moment in tribal history, but it also marks a devastating rupture that led to massive loss of life, forced relocation, and cultural suppression.[^77] Contemporary Seediq activists and cultural practitioners invoke Mona Rudao's memory in efforts to revitalize traditional practices, including the Alang Tongan Industry Promotion and Development Association's work visiting tribal elders to learn and record traditional hunting, weaving, and farming customs as part of rediscovering *gaya*.[^78]

The Seediq tribe's struggle for official recognition as a distinct indigenous group (finally achieved in April 2008 when they became Taiwan's 14th officially recognized indigenous group) drew symbolic power from the historical precedent of Mona Rudao's assertion of distinct Seediq identity separate from the Atayal classification imposed by previous governments.[^79] In this sense, his legacy continues to inform contemporary indigenous rights struggles, demonstrating connections between historical resistance and present-day activism.

The Wushe Incident Memorial Park, where Mona Rudao was eventually reburied, has become a site of historical memory and pilgrimage for those interested in indigenous history and anti-colonial resistance.[^80] The park serves educational functions, helping visitors understand the events of 1930 and their significance, while also providing a space for Seediq people to honor their ancestors and connect with their history. However, debates continue about how the incident should be commemorated and interpreted, with some arguing for greater emphasis on the tragedy and human costs, while others prioritize the heroism and resistance aspects of the story.

Internationally, Mona Rudao's story has contributed to broader discussions about indigenous rights, decolonization, and the ethics of resistance movements. His willingness to launch a militarily hopeless uprising in defense of cultural survival resonates with indigenous struggles worldwide, while the moral complexities of the violence employed raise difficult questions about the limits of justified resistance that remain relevant to contemporary conflicts.

Academic scholarship on Mona Rudao and the Wushe Incident continues to evolve, with researchers examining the events from multiple perspectives including indigenous history, colonial studies, military history, and cultural analysis. The limited written records from Seediq perspectives have encouraged scholars to incorporate oral histories and indigenous knowledge systems into their analyses, contributing to broader methodological shifts in how colonial history is studied and whose voices are centered in historical narratives.[^81]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and advocates who view Mona Rudao positively emphasize his role as a defender of indigenous sovereignty, cultural integrity, and human dignity in the face of systematic colonial oppression. This perspective, particularly strong in post-democratization Taiwan and among indigenous rights advocates, positions the Wushe Incident as a legitimate act of resistance against cultural genocide rather than as terrorism or criminal violence.

Academic supporters of this interpretation argue that Mona Rudao's leadership represented a rational response to impossible conditions. Japanese colonial policies were systematically destroying the foundations of Seediq culture through forced labor that prevented traditional economic activities, bans on essential cultural practices like facial tattooing and headhunting that determined spiritual salvation according to Seediq beliefs, land dispossession that eliminated the territorial basis of tribal autonomy, and routine police brutality that subjected indigenous people to violence and humiliation.[^82] From this perspective, Mona Rudao faced an existential choice: accept gradual cultural extinction through colonial assimilation policies, or fight to preserve Seediq identity knowing the likely outcome would be physical destruction.[^83]

Defenders of Mona Rudao's legacy emphasize that his 1911 tour of Japan demonstrated he understood Japanese military capabilities and made his decision to resist with full awareness of the likely consequences.[^84] Rather than indicating poor judgment, this knowledge underscores the depth of his commitment to Seediq cultural values and his belief that some things—specifically the ability to live according to *gaya* and secure passage across the rainbow bridge—were worth dying for. This interpretation resonates with broader philosophical traditions that value meaningful death over degrading survival, and positions Mona Rudao as a moral leader rather than a reckless militarist.

The memorial epitaph for Mona Rudao describes his "indomitable spirit" as potentially serving "as a model for our youth," reflecting official recognition of his courage and commitment.[^85] Supporters argue that his willingness to sacrifice everything for cultural preservation provides an enduring example of integrity and resistance to oppression that remains relevant for contemporary struggles against marginalization and assimilation.

Indigenous rights advocates particularly emphasize how the Wushe Incident catalyzed meaningful policy changes in Japanese colonial administration. The handling of the incident provoked widespread criticism both within Japan and internationally, forcing the resignation of Governor General Ishizuka Eizō and his chief civil administrator, and leading to a comprehensive reassessment of indigenous policies.[^86] The subsequent elevation of indigenous Taiwanese from "raw savages" to *takasagozoku* ("tribal peoples of Taiwan") with recognized status as imperial subjects represented a significant improvement in official standing, even if implementation remained problematic.[^87]

Contemporary Seediq cultural activists view Mona Rudao's legacy as inspirational for ongoing efforts to preserve and revitalize traditional practices. His resistance demonstrated that Seediq identity was worth defending, providing a historical precedent that legitimizes contemporary assertions of distinct cultural identity separate from dominant Taiwanese or Chinese nationalist narratives.[^88] The Alang Tongan Industry Promotion and Development Association's work to rediscover *gaya* and encourage young Seediq people to return to their communities explicitly draws on the memory of ancestors like Mona Rudao who sacrificed everything to preserve these traditions.[^89]

Scholars of colonial resistance movements place Mona Rudao within broader patterns of indigenous uprisings against European and Japanese imperialism throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Comparative analysis with other anti-colonial movements—from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 to the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya—reveals common patterns of accumulated grievances, symbolic triggers, and asymmetric warfare that characterize resistance against overwhelming colonial military power. Within this comparative framework, Mona Rudao's leadership demonstrates sophisticated political consciousness and organizational capability that challenges colonial stereotypes of indigenous peoples as unsophisticated or incapable of strategic planning.

The symbolic power of Mona Rudao's legacy has grown as Taiwan's democracy has matured and space has opened for diverse historical narratives beyond official nationalist accounts. His image on the 20 New Taiwan Dollar coin represents not just commemoration but active incorporation into Taiwanese civic identity in a way that recognizes indigenous peoples as foundational to Taiwan's history rather than marginal to it.[^90] This numismatic honor places indigenous resistance on par with other foundational national narratives, challenging historical erasure of indigenous contributions to Taiwan's development.

### Negative Views

Critics of Mona Rudao and the Wushe Incident raise fundamental moral, strategic, and historical concerns that complicate romanticized narratives of heroic resistance. These critical perspectives, while sometimes reflecting colonial-era prejudices, also include legitimate ethical questions about the targeting of civilians, the catastrophic consequences for the Seediq people, and the risks of glorifying violence.

The most serious criticism centers on the deliberate killing of 134 Japanese civilians, including women and children, during the October 27, 1930 attack on the school athletic event.[^91] From a humanitarian ethics perspective, the targeting of non-combatants cannot be justified regardless of the grievances motivating the attack. Critics argue that whatever legitimate complaints the Seediq had against Japanese colonial policies, murdering children at a school event crossed fundamental moral boundaries that should constrain even desperate resistance movements. The additional killing of two Han Taiwanese children mistaken for Japanese due to their clothing further demonstrates the indiscriminate nature of the violence.[^92]

Some historians question whether Mona Rudao adequately considered alternatives to violent uprising. Having collaborated with Japanese authorities for years and possessing unusual access to Japanese education and officials due to his position as a supported chief, he theoretically had channels for pursuing grievances through negotiation or appeals to higher authorities. Critics suggest that his decision to immediately escalate to mass violence may have foreclosed possibilities for reform or accommodation that could have improved conditions without the catastrophic loss of life that resulted.

Japanese colonial reports attributed the uprising to Mona Rudao's "personal ambitions and recalcitrant character" rather than to collective Seediq grievances or justified resistance.[^93] While these accounts are clearly propagandistic and designed to delegitimize indigenous resistance, they raise questions about the extent to which personal factors versus systemic oppression motivated the uprising. The fact that only six of eleven Seediq villages participated in the attack suggests that other chiefs made different calculations about whether violent resistance served their people's interests.[^94] Critics argue that this divided response indicates the uprising reflected Mona Rudao's particular disposition rather than a unified Seediq consensus about necessary action.

From a strategic perspective, the decision to launch a militarily hopeless uprising against overwhelming Japanese power has been characterized as reckless leadership that condemned the Seediq people to destruction. Having toured Japan and witnessed Japanese military capabilities firsthand, Mona Rudao knew his warriors faced artillery, aircraft, and thousands of trained soldiers backed by the resources of an industrial empire.[^95] Critics argue that launching an uprising with no realistic possibility of military success constituted a form of collective suicide that a responsible leader should have avoided. The catastrophic consequences—644 deaths among the 1,200 directly involved, plus 216 additional deaths in the Second Wushe Incident, forced relocation of survivors, and intensive cultural suppression—suggest the uprising ultimately accelerated rather than prevented the cultural destruction Mona Rudao claimed to oppose.[^96]

Some scholars question whether the intense surveillance, cultural bans, and suppression imposed on surviving Seediq after their forced relocation to Kawanakajima Village represented a worse outcome than the pre-uprising status quo. Japanese authorities called roll twice daily and banned all traditional activities, attempting to transform the Seediq into a "modern and civilized" rice farming community.[^97] Critics argue that if Mona Rudao's goal was preserving Seediq culture and autonomy, the uprising achieved precisely the opposite outcome by providing Japanese authorities with justification for comprehensive cultural suppression that might otherwise have faced greater constraints.

The Japanese use of chemical weapons during the suppression, while rightly condemned as a war crime, occurred as a direct response to Mona Rudao's uprising. Critics argue that his decision to initiate violence predictably triggered brutal retaliation that he should have anticipated, making him partially responsible for the disproportionate suffering inflicted on his people. The orchestrated Second Wushe Incident, in which Japanese authorities encouraged the Toda tribe to massacre Seediq survivors, similarly followed from the initial uprising and might have been avoided had Mona Rudao chosen different tactics.[^98]

Contemporary critics worry that romanticizing Mona Rudao's resistance risks glorifying violence and potentially inspiring destructive actions by groups facing oppression today. They argue that highlighting alternative forms of resistance—cultural preservation, legal advocacy, alliance-building, and long-term political organizing—would provide more constructive models for contemporary indigenous rights movements than celebrating a militarily suicidal uprising that killed civilians and ultimately failed to preserve the culture it aimed to defend.

Some Seediq descendants themselves harbor ambivalent feelings about Mona Rudao's legacy, recognizing both the courage of the resistance and the devastating consequences their communities endured for generations. The trauma of mass death, forced relocation, cultural suppression, and the Second Wushe Incident's internecine violence created wounds that extended far beyond the immediate participants. Mahung Mona's designation as "the woman who washed her face with tears" exemplifies the intergenerational grief that many Seediq families carried, complicating simple narratives of heroic sacrifice.[^99]

Critics also point to the treatment of Mona Rudao's remains as evidence that the uprising provided Japanese authorities with propaganda opportunities that harmed indigenous dignity. The exhibition of his skeleton as "a warning to future rebels" and its treatment "as if an animal specimen" violated Seediq spiritual beliefs and human decency, serving colonial interests in ways that might have been avoided had he chosen different forms of resistance.[^100]

Finally, some scholars argue that contemporary appropriation of Mona Rudao's legacy by competing political movements—whether Chinese nationalist narratives about Taiwan's liberation from Japanese imperialism or Taiwanese independence advocates emphasizing distinct identity separate from China—misrepresents his actual motivations and concerns. These competing appropriations risk erasing the specifically indigenous dimensions of the Wushe Incident in favor of nationalist agendas that would likely have been foreign to Mona Rudao's own understanding of Seediq sovereignty and cultural autonomy.

## Famous Quotes

> "There are more Japanese people than the tree leaves in the forest, than the pebbles in the river, but my determination to fight them is more adamant than the Mountain!" - Context: This quote, featured in the 2011 film *Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale*, captures Mona Rudao's recognition of the overwhelming numerical and military superiority of the Japanese colonial forces, while asserting his unwavering commitment to resistance despite impossible odds.[^101]

> "If your civilization wants us to cringe, I'll show you the pride of savages!" - Context: This cinematic quote from *Seediq Bale* articulates the fundamental conflict between Japanese colonial "civilization" policies that demanded cultural assimilation and subordination, and Seediq resistance rooted in pride, dignity, and commitment to traditional ways of life. Mona Rudao embraces the colonial designation of "savage" and transforms it into a badge of honor representing authentic cultural identity.[^102]

> "Living by gaya makes one a seediq bale, or 'true human,' entitled to join the ancestors across the rainbow bridge." - Context: While not a direct quotation from Mona Rudao, this principle from Seediq culture articulates the moral and spiritual framework that informed his decision to resist Japanese colonial suppression of traditional practices. The concept of *gaya* and the rainbow bridge were central to Seediq identity and explain why cultural preservation held greater value than physical survival for Mona Rudao and his warriors.[^103]

> "His indomitable spirit may serve as a model for our youth." - Context: This phrase from Mona Rudao's memorial epitaph reflects how his legacy has been officially commemorated in post-war Taiwan, transforming from colonial-era rebel to recognized symbol of courage and resistance against oppression.[^104]
