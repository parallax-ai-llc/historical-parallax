## Summary
Dennis Lynn Rader, the 'BTK Killer' (Bind, Torture, Kill), murdered 10 people in Wichita, Kansas between 1974 and 1991. A church president and Boy Scout leader, he taunted police and media for decades. He evaded capture for 31 years before being identified through floppy disk metadata in 2005.

## Early Life
Born on March 9, 1945, in Pittsburg, Kansas, Rader grew up in Wichita. He served in the Air Force, earned a degree in administration of justice, and worked for ADT Security and as a Park City compliance officer. He described childhood fantasies about binding and controlling women. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Starting with the murder of four members of the Otero family in January 1974, Rader killed 10 people over 17 years. He bound victims with elaborate knots and strangled them. He sent taunting letters to police and media, coining his own 'BTK' moniker while maintaining an outwardly exemplary civic life. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
After resuming communications in 2004, Rader asked police if a floppy disk could be traced. Metadata on a disk he sent to a TV station led to his church computer. Arrested February 25, 2005, he confessed to all 10 murders and was sentenced to 10 consecutive life terms. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
