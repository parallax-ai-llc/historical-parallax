## Summary

Verónica Michelle Bachelet Jeria is a Chilean politician and physician who served as President of Chile from 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018, becoming the first woman to hold the presidency in her country.[^1] A survivor of torture during Augusto Pinochet's military dictatorship, which also claimed her father's life, Bachelet rose through Chilean politics to break the glass ceiling in Latin American politics.[^2] After her presidential terms, she served as United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2018 to 2022, and in 2025 was nominated as Chile's official candidate for UN Secretary-General.[^3] Her political career has been marked by significant social reforms, economic pragmatism, and a commitment to human rights, though not without controversy and criticism.

## Early Life and Background

Michelle Bachelet was born on September 29, 1951, in Santiago, Chile, specifically in La Cisterna, a middle-class suburb of the capital.[^4] She was the daughter of Alberto Bachelet Martínez, a general in the Chilean Air Force, and Ángela Jeria, an anthropologist.[^5] Her childhood was marked by frequent moves due to her father's military career, which even took the family to Bethesda, Maryland, in the early 1960s when her father was assigned to the Chilean Embassy in Washington, D.C.[^6]

In 1964, the Bachelet family returned to Chile, where Michelle completed her secondary studies as a distinguished and active student at Liceo N° 1, Javiera Carrera High School in Santiago.[^7] She entered the career in medicine at the University of Chile in 1970, the same year she joined the Socialist Youth and became an active supporter of Salvador Allende's Popular Unity coalition.[^8] Her political consciousness was developing during one of Chile's most tumultuous political periods, setting the stage for the trauma that would soon follow.

The 1973 military coup that overthrew President Allende shattered the Bachelet family. Her father, who had been Allende's choice to head a food-rationing program, was arrested for opposing the military junta and was tortured for several months before suffering a heart attack and dying in police custody in March 1974.[^9] This tragedy was followed by an even more personal horror. On January 10, 1975, both Michelle and her mother were arrested by DINA agents (the regime's secret police) and taken to Villa Grimaldi, the regime's main torture and detention center.[^10] There, Bachelet was blindfolded and tied to a chair for long periods, and told that her mother would be executed.[^11]

An old family friend was able to secure their release, and they fled first to Australia—where Bachelet's brother was living—and then to East Germany in 1975.[^12] In exile, Bachelet studied German in Leipzig and enrolled at Humboldt University medical school in Berlin, demonstrating remarkable resilience in continuing her education despite her trauma.[^13] The family returned to Chile in 1979, where Bachelet resumed her medical studies at the University of Chile, graduating near the top of her class in 1982 with a medical degree in surgery, with a specialization in pediatrics and public health.[^14] She later studied military strategy at Chile's National Academy of Strategy and Policy and at the Inter-American Defense College in the United States, unusual educational credentials that would prove crucial to her political rise.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Bachelet's path to political power was gradual and methodical. After completing her medical training, she worked at an organization that helped children with mental health problems whose parents had been victims of the 1973-90 dictatorship, connecting her professional work to her personal experience.[^16] She became an active member of the Socialist Party, joining its Central Committee in 1995 and serving as an active member of the Political Commission from 1998 to 2000.[^17]

Her political breakthrough came in 2000 when President Ricardo Lagos appointed her as Minister of Health, a position in which she implemented healthcare reform to improve attention to primary care facilities with the aim of ensuring better and faster healthcare response for families.[^18] But her most surprising appointment came on January 7, 2002, when Lagos named her Minister of National Defense, making her the first woman in Chile and one of the few women in the world to hold such a position.[^19] This appointment was particularly remarkable given that Bachelet was a Socialist woman with no military background in a traditionally conservative, male-dominated institution, and considering that the military had tortured her and killed her father.[^20]

As Defense Minister from 2002 to 2004, Bachelet worked to modernize the armed forces and improve civil-military relations in post-Pinochet Chile.[^21] Her performance in this role elevated her national profile considerably. She resigned from the Defence Ministry on October 1, 2004, to focus on her presidential campaign.[^22] The Socialist Party chose her as its candidate for the presidency, and her campaign emphasized social inclusion, gender equality, and continuity with the successful economic policies of the Lagos administration.[^23]

Bachelet led the first round of presidential voting in December 2005, and on January 15, 2006, she won the runoff election with 54% of the vote, becoming the first woman elected president of Chile and notably the first woman in the Americas to gain that post without a link to a husband.[^24] Her inauguration marked a historic moment not just for Chile but for Latin America as a whole, where women had rarely held executive power in their own right.[^25]

## Major Achievements

### First Presidential Term (2006-2010)

Bachelet's first presidency was marked by several significant accomplishments, despite facing serious challenges early in her term. Her most praised achievement was her economic management during the global financial crisis of 2008.[^26] When the price of copper—one of Chile's main exports—peaked during the commodity boom of the mid-2000s, she directed the government to set aside the profits rather than spend them immediately.[^27] This counter-cyclical fiscal policy, embodying high-level political consensus, created a sovereign wealth fund that enabled the country to easily weather the global financial crisis of 2008 and funded pension reforms, social programs, and a stimulus package to create jobs.[^28]

In March 2006, Bachelet created an advisory committee to reform Chile's pension system, and in March 2008 she signed the bill into law.[^29] The new legislation established a Basic Solidarity Pension (PBS) and a Solidarity Pension Contribution (APS), guaranteeing a minimum pension for the 60% poorest segment of the population, regardless of their contribution history.[^30] This reform addressed one of Chile's most pressing social issues—inadequate retirement income for millions of citizens.

Bachelet was credited with reducing poverty and improving early childhood education during her first term.[^31] In January 2010, she opened the Museum of Memory and Human Rights in Santiago, a powerful symbol of Chile's commitment to remembering the victims of the Pinochet dictatorship.[^32] When she left office in March 2010, her popular support was at a record 84%, according to conservative polling institute Adimark GfK, one of the highest approval ratings for any departing president in Chilean history.[^33]

### International Leadership (2011-2013)

After her first presidency, Bachelet's international reputation led to her appointment as the first Director of UN Women in 2011, an organization dedicated to fighting for the rights of women and girls internationally.[^34] In this role, she worked on increasing women's political participation, women's economic empowerment, and fighting to end violence against women.[^35] She resigned from UN Women on March 23, 2013, to return to Chile and prepare for another presidential campaign.[^36]

### Second Presidential Term (2014-2018)

Bachelet was re-elected in December 2013 with over 62% of the vote, making her the first President of Chile to be re-elected since 1932.[^37] Her second presidency was far more ambitious in its reform agenda than her first, though also more controversial and less successful in some respects.[^38]

Among her many achievements during her second term, education and tax reforms stood out, as well as the creation of the National Institute for Human Rights and the Museum of Memory and Human Rights, the establishment of the Ministry of Women and Gender Equality, the adoption of quotas to increase women's political participation, and the approval of Civil Union Act legislation.[^39] In 2015, under her leadership, Chile legalized same-sex civil unions, a landmark moment in Latin America signaling growing recognition of LGBTQ+ rights in a region where such issues had long been taboo.[^40]

Bachelet introduced tuition-free higher education, a central campaign promise from 2013.[^41] The 2016 budget law funded tuition-free higher education for students in the bottom half of the income distribution who enrolled in public universities and a set of private institutions that met certain criteria.[^42] By 2016, the government had extended free university education to students in the bottom 60 percent of the household income scale.[^43] The measure was expected to aid about 200,000 students at state universities.[^44]

In September 2017, Bachelet designated a new 720,000 square kilometer marine protection area around Easter Island, protecting at least 142 endemic marine species, including 27 threatened with extinction.[^45] This conservation achievement followed a vote by Easter Island's Rapa Nui inhabitants, 73% of whom favored establishing the zone.[^46]

### UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (2018-2022)

Bachelet was appointed by the UN General Assembly on August 10, 2018, as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, assuming her functions on September 1, 2018.[^47] During her four-year term, she dealt with numerous challenging human rights situations globally.[^48] She stated she was most proud of her Office's support and strong backing of the recognition of the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.[^49]

One of her most significant actions as High Commissioner was her July 2019 report on Venezuela, which denounced the extrajudicial execution of 6,800 people by State forces between January 2018 and May 2019.[^50] The report emphasized that especially since 2016 the presidency of Nicolás Maduro and State institutions had implemented a strategy "aimed at neutralizing, repressing and criminalizing the political opposition and those who criticize the government".[^51] She announced on June 13, 2022, that she would not seek a second term as UN High Commissioner, with her term expiring on August 31, 2022.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her achievements, Bachelet's political career has been marked by significant controversies and failures that have drawn substantial criticism from various quarters.

### First Term Challenges: Transantiago and Student Protests

Early in her first presidency, Bachelet faced the 2006 student protests, known as the "Revolución de los Pingüinos" (Penguins' Revolution—named for students' black and white uniforms).[^53] The protests began just three months after her inauguration, and her reaction was widely deemed slow and insufficient, contributing to the first drop in her approval rating.[^54] On June 1, 2006, following a national strike that drew 935,700 participants across the country, Bachelet addressed the nation by television, announcing several new measures for education that met most of the students' demands.[^55] However, critics argue that the Bachelet administration merely temporarily co-opted the student movement by granting some immediate concessions and creating a presidential advisory committee, without addressing deeper structural issues.[^56]

In February 2007, Santiago's transport system was radically altered with the introduction of Transantiago, a public transportation overhaul designed under the previous administration but implemented under Bachelet.[^57] The system was nearly unanimously condemned by the media, the users, and the opposition, significantly damaging her popularity and leading to the sacking of her Transport minister.[^58] Bachelet's popularity dipped to a low of 35% approval in September 2007, mainly attributed to the Transantiago fiasco.[^59] The transportation disaster became a symbol of government incompetence and poor planning.

### Second Term: Economic Slowdown and Education Reform Backlash

Bachelet's second presidency faced more sustained criticism than her first. Critics blamed her tax reforms for complexity that drove away investment and for the slowdown of the Chilean economy during her second period in office.[^60] The ambitious education reforms also faced attacks from multiple sides. Leftist students complained that the reforms would benefit only a minority of the approximately 720,000 students, as students who attend private and autonomous universities would remain excluded, and with the 60% income requirement, only about 232,000 students would have access to free education.[^61] Opposition parties, lower middle class voters, and certain members of Bachelet's Nueva Mayoría coalition attacked the proposals, arguing that the law preventing individuals from earning profits on public resources would not address improvements in quality of education.[^62]

Academic assessments of her second term were mixed. A book-length study on the Bachelet administration published in the U.S. left an impression of a failed presidency, though scholars debated whether the disappointment reflected genuine performance issues or whether "her political and sexual difference created a higher standard of achievement for her among scholars."[^63]

### UN Human Rights Commissioner Controversies

Bachelet's tenure as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights was marred by significant controversies, particularly regarding her handling of China and other authoritarian regimes. Her visit to Xinjiang in May 2022 marked the first time in 17 years a UN human rights chief visited the region, but it was heavily criticized by organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Campaign for Uyghurs, and the World Uyghur Congress.[^64]

Amnesty International stated that Bachelet had "failed to condemn crimes against humanity and other grave human rights violations by the Chinese authorities."[^65] Critics accused her of whitewashing the crimes of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, noting that she parroted Beijing's language about "counter-terrorism" and "de-radicalisation," praised China's role in "multilateralism," and trumpeted the CCP's achievements in eradicating poverty.[^66] She even used Chinese terminology, describing internment camps as educational and vocational training centers.[^67]

A report by UN Watch titled "Blind Eye to Dictatorships" documented how Bachelet's statements on China over four years turned a blind eye to Beijing's violations against women, children, and migrants, including forced labor which she mentioned once only in passing.[^68] The report criticized her for ignoring arbitrary detentions, reprisals against human rights defenders and their families, and widespread violations in Tibet.[^69] Human Rights Watch described Bachelet as "widely and justifiably criticized by governments and rights groups after her recent visit to China for failing to condemn the Chinese government's abysmal rights record, notably the persecution of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims in Xinjiang."[^70]

Foreign Policy magazine published an analysis titled "Michelle Bachelet's Xinjiang Disaster Taints Her Legacy at the United Nations," and The Diplomat ran a piece called "Michelle Bachelet's Spectacular Fall From Grace."[^71][^72] These assessments suggested that her final months as High Commissioner had significantly damaged her previously strong reputation as a human rights defender.

## Personal Life

Michelle Bachelet married Jorge Dávalos (also known as Jorge Leopoldo Dávalos Cartes), an architect and fellow Chilean exile, in Germany in 1977 or 1979.[^73] Together they had two children: Jorge Alberto Sebastián, born in 1978 in Leipzig, Germany, and Francisca Valentina, born in February 1984.[^74] Some time after the birth of their second child, Bachelet and Dávalos legally separated, though they were unable to divorce because Chile's conservative family law statutes prohibited divorce at the time.[^75] Bachelet later had a third child, Sofia, in the early 1990s with a fellow physician.[^76]

Bachelet's personal experiences profoundly shaped her political identity and worldview. The torture she endured at Villa Grimaldi and the death of her father in custody under Pinochet's dictatorship gave her an intimate understanding of human rights violations and political persecution.[^77] These experiences informed both her domestic policies as president and her later work as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.[^78]

She has been notably open about her identity, famously stating: "As the old joke goes, I have all the sins together. I am a woman, a Socialist, separated and agnostic."[^79] This self-deprecating humor about her departure from Chile's traditionally conservative Catholic social norms endeared her to progressive voters while also highlighting the barriers she had overcome.

Bachelet's leadership style has been described as emphasizing gender parity and creating a "gobierno ciudadano" (citizen's government).[^80] She promised new faces in the cabinet and made good on her commitment to gender equality by appointing women to half of her cabinet positions, a radical step in Chilean politics.[^81] Time magazine ranked her the world's 15th most influential person in 2008, recognizing her impact beyond Chile's borders.[^82]

## Legacy

Michelle Bachelet's legacy is complex and multifaceted, encompassing her groundbreaking role as Latin America's first independently elected female president, her significant policy achievements, and the controversies that marked the later stages of her career.

As a trailblazer for women in politics, Bachelet's impact cannot be overstated. She became the first woman elected president of Chile in 2006 and the first woman in the Americas to gain that post without a link to a husband, breaking a significant glass ceiling in a region with strong patriarchal traditions.[^83] Even before her presidency, as Minister of National Defense from 2002, she was the first woman in a Latin American country and one of the few in the world to hold this position.[^84] Her success demonstrated that women could lead even in traditionally male-dominated arenas like national defense and executive governance.

Her policy legacy from her first presidential term is largely positive, particularly her economic stewardship during the global financial crisis. The copper windfall management and counter-cyclical fiscal policy became a model for resource-rich countries, showing how prudent economic management could buffer against external shocks.[^85] The pension reforms she implemented provided crucial social protection for Chile's most vulnerable citizens.[^86]

Her second term's education reforms, despite their controversies, represented a significant attempt to address Chile's highly unequal education system and reduce the role of profit-making in higher education.[^87] The legalization of same-sex civil unions advanced LGBTQ+ rights in a socially conservative country.[^88] The marine protection area around Easter Island represented a major environmental conservation achievement.[^89]

However, her legacy is complicated by the failures of Transantiago, which became a symbol of government incompetence, and by the student protests that erupted in both 2006 and—following unmet expectations—in 2011 after her first term ended.[^90] Many newspapers and analysts have traced the 2011 protests back to the 2006 Penguin Revolution, claiming that the Bachelet administration elevated and aggravated student expectations by failing to follow through on promises.[^91]

Her tenure as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, which could have cemented her legacy as an international human rights champion, was instead tarnished by widespread criticism of her approach to China and other authoritarian regimes.[^92] The perception that she had been co-opted by Beijing significantly damaged her reputation among human rights organizations and activists.[^93]

Despite these controversies, Bachelet's nomination by Chilean President Gabriel Boric on September 23, 2025, to become the next Secretary-General of the United Nations upon the end of António Guterres' tenure in 2026 suggests that her supporters believe she still has much to contribute on the global stage.[^94] PassBlue survey results showed her leading the race with 29.1% support, more than doubling the support for her nearest competitor.[^95]

Ultimately, Bachelet's legacy is that of a pioneering leader who shattered barriers for women in politics, implemented significant social and economic reforms, survived personal trauma to reach the highest levels of power, yet also faced substantial criticism for policy failures and perceived compromises with authoritarian regimes. While breaking the glass ceiling of reaching the presidency was historic, scholars note that her lasting legacy is governing with unusual skill and distinction in her first term, even as her second term and UN tenure proved more controversial.[^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholars who view Bachelet positively emphasize her role as a trailblazer who opened doors for women in politics not just in Chile but throughout Latin America. The Council of Women World Leaders has highlighted her leadership, noting that she governed with courage and conviction while reforming Chilean society.[^97] Her achievement of an 84% approval rating at the end of her first presidential term is cited as evidence of her effective governance and ability to connect with the Chilean people.[^98]

Economists and policy analysts have praised her counter-cyclical fiscal policy during the copper boom, which demonstrated sophisticated economic management and allowed Chile to weather the 2008 global financial crisis better than many other countries.[^99] The creation of a sovereign wealth fund from copper revenues, which was then used to fund pension reforms and social programs, is often cited as a model for other resource-rich nations.[^100]

Her defenders argue that the education reforms of her second term, despite their implementation challenges, represented a bold attempt to address fundamental inequalities in Chilean society and to reduce the commodification of education.[^101] Supporters note that she was attempting to undo decades of neoliberal education policy in a highly polarized political environment.[^102]

As UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, her supporters emphasize her work on recognizing the human right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, and her willingness to issue critical reports on human rights situations, including her devastating critique of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.[^103] They argue that her role required navigating complex political dynamics while maintaining the credibility of the UN human rights system.[^104]

Gender equality advocates point to her consistent emphasis on women's rights throughout her career, from her work at UN Women to her implementation of gender parity in cabinet appointments and her support for quotas to increase women's political participation.[^105] Her message to women—"We can do it. We are capable of doing almost anything, but we must learn we cannot do it all at once, we need to prioritize"—has inspired many.[^106]

### Negative Views

Critics of Bachelet argue that she failed to live up to the transformative promise of her presidencies, particularly during her second term. Conservative opponents criticized her tax and education reforms for damaging Chile's economic competitiveness and for ideological overreach.[^107] They point to the economic slowdown during her second term as evidence that her policies were misguided.[^108]

From the left, critics argue that Bachelet did not go far enough in challenging Chile's neoliberal economic model. Student activists and leftist political movements criticized her education reforms as insufficient because they left many students excluded from free tuition and did not adequately address quality issues.[^109] The fact that protests erupted in both 2006 and 2011 (the latter during her successor's term but traceable to unmet expectations from her first presidency) suggests to critics that she failed to fundamentally transform Chile's education system despite promises to do so.[^110]

The Transantiago debacle is cited by critics as evidence of poor administrative competence and failure to adequately prepare for the implementation of a complex public policy.[^111] The sharp drop in her approval ratings in 2007, from the high 50s to 35%, demonstrated the political cost of this failure.[^112]

Her tenure as UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has drawn the most severe criticism. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, condemned her approach to China as a betrayal of her mandate to defend human rights.[^113] Critics accused her of whitewashing the Chinese government's crimes against Uyghurs and other minorities, using Beijing's own propaganda language, and failing to press for access to detention facilities and victims.[^114] UN Watch's comprehensive report "Blind Eye to Dictatorships" documented what it characterized as a systematic pattern of downplaying human rights abuses by authoritarian regimes.[^115]

Academic assessments have questioned whether her two presidencies represented genuine transformation or merely modest tinkering within Chile's established neoliberal framework. Some scholars suggest that gender and political biases may have led to harsher assessments of her performance compared to male predecessors, while others argue that the criticism is warranted based on policy outcomes.[^116]
