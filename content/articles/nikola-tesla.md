## Summary

Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, and physicist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. A visionary genius and showman, Tesla held over 300 patents and pioneered work including the AC motor, wireless communication, X-rays, radio, remote control, and the Tesla coil. He competed with Thomas Edison in the "War of Currents," with Tesla's AC system ultimately prevailing. Despite brilliant inventions, Tesla died impoverished and largely forgotten, his later claims about death rays and wireless power towers dismissed as eccentric. Today he's recognized as one of history's greatest inventors, an icon of mad genius and overlooked brilliance, though his life story has been mythologized with both hero worship and exaggeration.

## Early Life

Born July 10, 1856, in Smiljan (Austrian Empire, now Croatia) during a lightning storm—fitting for future electrical genius. Father was Serbian Orthodox priest; mother invented household appliances.

Showed extraordinary memory and visualization abilities from childhood. Could perform calculus mentally and visualize inventions in complete detail without drawings.

Studied engineering at Austrian Polytechnic, Graz (1875), excelling initially but becoming disillusioned. Left without degree.

## Europe and Edison (1882-1888)

Worked for telegraph and electrical companies in Budapest and Paris. Invented AC induction motor (1882) while walking in park—complete design visualization in instant.

In 1884, age 28, emigrated to New York with letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison. Edison hired Tesla at Edison Machine Works.

### The Edison Years

Tesla and Edison clashed:
- **Edison**: Practical, DC (direct current) advocate, empirical trial-and-error
- **Tesla**: Theoretical, AC advocate, visualized solutions mentally

**Famous Promise:**
Edison allegedly promised Tesla $50,000 to improve DC dynamos. Tesla succeeded but Edison called it a "joke"—Tesla quit.

---

## War of Currents (1886-1892)

Tesla partnered with George Westinghouse (rival to Edison) to develop AC power system.

**AC vs. DC:**
- **DC (Edison)**: Low voltage, can't travel far (needs power station every mile)
- **AC (Tesla/Westinghouse)**: High voltage transmission, transforms to low voltage
- AC clearly superior for power distribution

**Edison's Campaign:**
Edison fought dirty, conducting public demonstrations:
- Electrocuting animals (including elephant Topsy) with AC to show it's "dangerous"
- Backed AC electric chair for executions ("Westinghoused")
- Propaganda campaign painting AC as deadly

**Tesla's Victory:**
- 1893: Chicago World's Fair illuminated by Westinghouse AC system
- 1896: Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant used Tesla's system
- AC became standard worldwide

## Major Inventions

### AC Induction Motor

Invented 1882, patented 1888. Uses rotating magnetic field, no commutator needed. Revolutionized industry—still powers most appliances and machines.

### Tesla Coil (1891)

High-voltage transformer producing spectacular electrical discharges. Uses:
- Radio transmission
- Wireless power demonstrations
- Scientific experiments
- Modern: entertainment, education

Tesla demonstrated at lectures, creating lightning bolts and lighting fluorescent tubes wirelessly—audiences amazed.

### Radio

Tesla filed radio patents before Marconi. Supreme Court (1943) ruled Tesla invented radio first, though Marconi got credit initially and Nobel Prize (1909). Dispute continues.

### Remote Control

Demonstrated radio-controlled boat at Madison Square Garden (1898). Crowd thought it was magic or telepathy. First remote-controlled device.

### X-Rays

Independently experimented with X-rays, called them "shadowgraphs." Photographed bones. Röntgen published first, got credit.

### Other Contributions

- Wireless communication
- Neon and fluorescent lighting
- Bladeless turbine
- Improved dynamos, motors, generators
- Wireless energy transfer experiments

---

## Wardenclyffe Tower (1901-1906)

Tesla's most ambitious project: wireless transmission of electrical power and communications worldwide.

**Wardenclyffe Tower** (Long Island):
- 187-foot tower
- Intended to transmit power wirelessly
- Financed initially by J.P. Morgan

**Failure:**
- Costs exceeded budget
- Morgan withdrew funding (wanted communication, not free power)
- Marconi achieved transatlantic radio, undermining Tesla's pitch
- Project abandoned 1906, tower demolished 1917

This failure devastated Tesla financially and emotionally.

## Later Years and Eccentricities

### Personal Quirks

Tesla never married, claiming celibacy helped his scientific work. Developed increasing obsessive-compulsive behaviors:
- **Number 3**: Did everything in threes (hotel rooms divisible by 3)
- **Pigeons**: Fed pigeons daily, fell in love with white pigeon, devastated when it died
- **Germophobia**: Avoided shaking hands, used napkins to handle objects
- **Isolation**: Lived alone in hotels, worked in seclusion

### Grand Claims

In later years made increasingly wild claims:
- **Death Ray**: Particle beam weapon
- **Thought Photography**: Photographing thoughts
- **Earthquake Machine**: Small vibrator allegedly caused earthquake in New York
- **Wireless Power**: Global wireless energy

Some may have had basis in real experiments; most unproven.

### Poverty

Despite past successes, Tesla died poor:
- Westinghouse tore up contracts (giving up royalties) to save company
- Poor businessman, exploited by financiers
- Spent money on experiments, not savings
- Lived on credit in hotels, accruing debts

## Death and Legacy

Died January 7, 1943, age 86, alone in New York Hotel New Yorker room 3327. Found by maid two days later. Died penniless despite transforming world.

**FBI Investigation:**
FBI seized Tesla's papers after death (feared foreign powers would get them). Eventually released to Tesla Museum in Belgrade.

### Modern Recognition

**Scientific Legacy:**
- AC power runs modern world
- Motors, transformers based on Tesla's patents
- Tesla recognized as peer of Edison, not inferior

**Cultural Icon:**
- "Mad scientist" archetype
- Overlooked genius vs. Edison (credit thief)
- Symbol of pure science vs. commercialism
- Electric car company "Tesla" named for him (by Elon Musk)

**SI Unit:**
Tesla (T) = unit of magnetic flux density

**Myths vs. Reality:**
Tesla's story often exaggerated:
- **Myth**: Edison stole all Tesla's ideas
- **Reality**: They competed; both brilliant in different ways
- **Myth**: Tesla could have provided free energy for world
- **Reality**: Wireless power works short distances, not globally economically
- **Myth**: Government suppressed Tesla's inventions
- **Reality**: Some ideas impractical; some ahead of their time

## Famous Quotes

> "The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."

> "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration."

> "The day science begins to study non-physical phenomena, it will make more progress in one decade than in all the previous centuries of its existence."

> "Of all the frictional resistances, the one that most retards human movement is ignorance."

> "I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men."
