## Summary

Edsger Dijkstra was a Dutch computer scientist who made fundamental contributions to programming methodology, algorithm design, and the theory of concurrent computing. He invented Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths and the semaphore mechanism for concurrent programming. His famous 'Go To Statement Considered Harmful' letter helped establish structured programming. He received the Turing Award in 1972.
