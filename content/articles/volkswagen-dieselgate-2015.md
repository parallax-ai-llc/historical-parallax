## Overview

The Volkswagen emissions scandal, known as "Dieselgate," began in September 2015 when the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice of violation to the German automaker. VW had intentionally installed "defeat device" software in 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. This software detected when the car was undergoing emissions testing and turned on pollution controls. During normal driving, the controls were turned off to improve performance/mileage, causing cars to emit up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxides (NOx). The scandal shattered VW's reputation for engineering ("Clean Diesel"), cost the company $30+ billion, and accelerated the global industry shift toward electric vehicles.

## The Deception

### "Clean Diesel"

**Marketing:**
VW marketed diesel cars in US as eco-friendly alternative to hybrids. "Fun to drive" + "Clean."

**The Engineering Problem:**
Meeting strict US NOx standards required bulky/expensive "AdBlue" urea tanks or miserable performance. VW engineers couldn't fix it legally within budget/time.

**The Solution (Cheat):**
Bosh supplied software for testing. VW engineers adapted it:
- If steering wheel isn't moving + hood open + specific speed pattern = **TEST MODE** (Low emissions).
- Steering moving = **DRIVE MODE** (Pollution controls off).

## The Discovery

### West Virginia University (2013-2014)

**The Study:**
ICCT (Clean transportation non-profit) commissioned tiny study to *prove* European diesels were clean. Hired WVU researchers.
They tested a Passat and Jetta on the road (using portable equipment).

**The Result:**
Emissions were 40x higher on road than in lab.
They thought their equipment was broken. It wasn't.

### EPA Investigation

EPA pressed VW for explanation. VW stalled for a year ("technical glitches").
**Ultimatum:**
EPA threatened to withhold certification for 2016 models.
**Confession (Sept 3, 2015):** VW engineer finally admitted existence of defeat device.

## The Fallout

**September 18, 2015:**
EPA public announcement.
VW stock crashed 35% in two days.

**Resignations:**
CEO Martin Winterkorn resigned ("I am stunned").

**Recalls:**
11 million cars affected globally (500k in US).
US Buyback program (owners got huge payouts).

**Criminal Charges:**
- VW pled guilty to criminal charges.
- Paid $2.8 billion criminal fine.
- Executives charged/arrested (Oliver Schmidt jailed in US).

## Legacy

**Death of Diesel:**
Diesel sales collapsed in Europe and US.

**Rise of EV:**
VW pivoted aggressively to electric (ID series) to rebuild image. "Dieselgate" ironically birthed the rapid EV transition of the 2020s.
