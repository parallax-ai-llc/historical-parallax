## Summary

Niels Henrik Abel was a Norwegian mathematician who made pioneering contributions to algebra despite dying at just 26. He proved the impossibility of solving the general quintic equation by radicals and made foundational contributions to the theory of elliptic functions. The Abel Prize in mathematics is named in his honor. His work on Abelian groups and functions became fundamental to modern algebra.
