## Summary

Hulagu Khan (c. 1217 – February 8, 1265) was a Mongol ruler who conquered much of Western Asia and founded the Ilkhanate in Persia.[^1] As a grandson of Genghis Khan and brother of Möngke Khan and Kublai Khan, he led one of history's most devastating military campaigns, destroying the Nizari Ismaili Assassins' stronghold at Alamut in 1256 and sacking Baghdad in 1258, thereby ending the Abbasid Caliphate and the Islamic Golden Age.[^2] His legacy remains deeply controversial—reviled in the Islamic world for unprecedented destruction yet recognized by some historians as a transformative figure who laid the foundations for centralized rule in Persia and ultimately the modern nation of Iran.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Hulagu Khan was born circa 1217 to Tolui, the youngest son of Genghis Khan, and Sorghaghtani Beki, an influential Keraite princess of Nestorian Christian faith.[^4] His mother was renowned for her political acumen and successfully navigated the treacherous landscape of Mongol court politics to ensure all her sons achieved positions of leadership within the empire.[^5] Sorghaghtani Beki's influence on Hulagu's upbringing was profound, instilling in him a degree of religious tolerance uncommon among Mongol commanders, particularly toward Christians.

Little is documented about Hulagu's childhood, but one significant anecdote recorded in Jami' al-Tawarikh describes how in 1224, at approximately seven years old, Hulagu accompanied his brother Kublai to meet their grandfather Genghis Khan, who was returning from campaigns in Transoxiana and Iran.[^6] During this meeting, Genghis Khan ritually anointed the bowstring fingers of both grandsons with fat from slain game, a ceremonial act symbolizing their initiation into warrior status and marking their entry into the martial traditions of the Mongol nobility.[^7]

As with other Mongol princes of his generation, Hulagu's education lacked formal institutional structure but centered on the practical mastery of warfare essentials: archery from horseback, endurance riding across vast distances, wrestling, and strategic coordination through organized hunts that replicated army maneuvers on a smaller scale.[^8] These skills were honed from childhood under familial oversight and the tutelage of experienced warriors, preparing him for military command without recorded scholarly pursuits beyond basic literacy in the Uighur-Mongol script used for administrative purposes.[^9] Growing up in the Mongol heartland during a period of unprecedented expansion, Hulagu was trained in warfare, diplomacy, and leadership from a young age, observing firsthand the methods by which his family had conquered much of the known world.[^10]

---

## Rise to Power

Hulagu's path to prominence accelerated dramatically following the accession of his brother Möngke Khan to the Mongol throne in 1251.[^11] As the new Great Khan, Möngke sought to consolidate and expand Mongol power through systematic campaigns in multiple directions. In one of his first major strategic decisions, Möngke appointed Hulagu to lead a massive expedition westward into the Islamic territories of Southwest Asia, tasking him with subduing regions that had resisted Mongol authority and eliminating threats to the empire's southwestern frontier.[^12]

In 1253, Hulagu departed Mongolia at the head of perhaps the largest Mongol army ever assembled for a single campaign.[^13] By order of Möngke Khan, two-tenths of the entire empire's fighting men—drawn from across the vast Mongol domains—were gathered for Hulagu's expedition, creating a multinational force estimated at over 138,000 troops.[^14] This deliberate concentration of military power reflected Möngke's determination to achieve decisive victory in the west and signaled the campaign's paramount importance to overall Mongol strategic objectives.

The army's march westward was methodical and deliberate, designed to allow time for logistical preparation and the integration of units from diverse regions.[^15] Hulagu's forces reached Transoxiana in 1255, where he established forward bases and gathered intelligence about his primary targets.[^16] The expedition's first major objective was the elimination of the Nizari Ismaili state, known in Crusader sources as the Order of Assassins, which had defied previous Mongol ultimatums and posed a continued security threat through its network of fortified strongholds and program of political assassinations.[^17]

From this position of overwhelming strength, Hulagu transformed from a Mongol prince into a conqueror in his own right, wielding unprecedented military power in a region that had known centuries of Islamic rule. His methodical approach—combining military might with diplomatic pressure and strategic patience—would characterize the campaigns that followed and establish him as one of the most formidable commanders of the Mongol age.[^18]

## Major Achievements

### Destruction of the Nizari Ismaili State (1256)

Hulagu's first major triumph came with his systematic dismantling of the Nizari Ismaili state in 1256.[^19] The Nizari Ismailis, founded by Hassan-i Sabbah after seizing Alamut Castle in 1090, had established a decentralized network of fortified strongholds throughout Persia and Syria, from which they conducted a campaign of targeted political assassinations against rulers who threatened their interests.[^20] For over 150 years, these fortress-sanctuaries had proven impregnable to conventional sieges, earning the sect a fearsome reputation.

Beginning his campaign in early 1256, Hulagu employed a combination of overwhelming force and psychological warfare.[^21] On November 8, 1256, he established his main siege camp on a hilltop facing the primary Nizari fortifications.[^22] The sheer size of the Mongol army, coupled with intelligence reports of its devastation elsewhere, convinced the young Nizari Imam Rukn al-Din Khurshah that resistance was futile. On November 19, 1256, Khurshah surrendered Alamut to the Mongols, and subsidiary fortresses soon followed.[^23]

The conquest's most tragic dimension was the destruction of Alamut's legendary library, which housed centuries of Ismaili scholarship, scientific works, and rare manuscripts.[^24] Under Hulagu's permission, the Persian historian Juvayni, who traveled with the Mongol army, explored the library and salvaged a few works he deemed worthy before the remainder was consigned to flames.[^25] Möngke Khan subsequently ordered a massacre of Nizari Ismailis throughout Persia, with estimates of the dead reaching nearly 100,000.[^26] Rukn al-Din Khurshah himself, who had traveled to Mongolia hoping to negotiate with the Great Khan, was killed by his Mongol guards en route.[^27]

### Fall of Baghdad and End of the Abbasid Caliphate (1258)

The sack of Baghdad in 1258 stands as Hulagu's most historically significant and controversial achievement.[^28] Baghdad, founded in 762 CE as the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, had become the intellectual and cultural heart of the Islamic world. The city hosted the House of Wisdom, astronomical observatories, countless libraries, colleges, and scholars representing every field of medieval knowledge, making it "the intellectual capital of the planet."[^29]

In November 1257, Hulagu's army set out for Baghdad after Caliph al-Musta'sim repeatedly rebuffed Mongol demands for submission and military support.[^30] The Mongol forces, approaching from multiple directions, systematically isolated the city. On January 17, 1258, they routed a sortie by flooding the opposing camp, then invested the city, which was defended by approximately 30,000 troops.[^31] The assault began in late January, with Mongol siege engines—operated by Chinese engineers under General Guo Kan—breaching Baghdad's ancient fortifications within days.[^32]

On February 10, 1258, Caliph al-Musta'sim surrendered the city, but this capitulation did not spare Baghdad from devastation.[^33] Three days later, Mongol troops began a systematic sack that lasted approximately one week. The destruction was comprehensive: mosques, palaces, libraries, hospitals, and grand buildings that had been the work of generations were burned to the ground.[^34] Historical accounts describe streets running with blood and the Tigris River turning black from ink of destroyed manuscripts.[^35] Hulagu later estimated the death toll at around 200,000, though the true number remains unknown and was likely increased by subsequent epidemics.[^36]

The execution of Caliph al-Musta'sim on February 20, 1258, carried profound symbolic weight, as it marked the end of the Abbasid Caliphate that had ruled the Islamic world for over 500 years.[^37] This event is widely regarded as marking the definitive end of the Islamic Golden Age, fundamentally reshaping the political and religious landscape of the Middle East.[^38]

### Conquest of Syria (1259-1260)

Following the fall of Baghdad, Hulagu turned his attention toward Syria and the Levant. In autumn 1259, his forces advanced from Azerbaijan, quickly overwhelming organized resistance.[^39] Aleppo fell after a short siege, and Damascus surrendered without significant combat on March 1, 1260, under the Christian Mongol general Kitbuqa.[^40] By early summer 1260, Mongol forces had reached Gaza on the frontier with Egypt, representing the western high-water mark of their expansion.[^41]

### Establishment of the Ilkhanate

Hulagu's conquests created a vast territorial domain in Southwest Asia that required governance. He established his capital at Maragheh in Azerbaijan and founded the Ilkhanate, which would rule Persia and surrounding regions until 1335.[^42] The Ilkhanate represented a new synthesis of Mongol military power and Persian administrative traditions, laying foundations that would influence the region's political development for centuries.[^43]

### Patronage of Science and Culture

Despite his reputation as a destroyer, Hulagu also patronized learning and scientific advancement. In 1259, he authorized the construction of the Maragheh Observatory under the direction of the brilliant Persian scientist Nasir al-Din al-Tusi.[^44] Hulagu became the first ruler in history to fund an observatory through a religious endowment (waqf), demonstrating his interest in astronomy—motivated partly by his Buddhist beliefs and partly by the practical applications of astrology in Mongol decision-making.[^45] The Maragheh Observatory became far more than a place for observing stars; it evolved into a major center for inquiry in mathematics, various sciences, and philosophy, attracting scholars from across the Islamic world and as far as China.[^46] The facility remained active for over 50 years and employed more than a hundred astronomers during its lifespan.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Unprecedented Scale of Destruction

Hulagu Khan's military campaigns are remembered in the Islamic world as among the most catastrophic events in Muslim history.[^48] The destruction of Baghdad in particular is viewed as both a military catastrophe and a cultural apocalypse, with one contemporary historian stating that the calamities were "so terrible and calamities so stupendous that neither day nor night have ever brought forth the like."[^49] Estimates suggest that millions of Muslims were killed during Hulagu's campaigns across Persia, Mesopotamia, and Syria.[^50]

The physical destruction extended far beyond human casualties. Irrigation systems that had sustained agriculture for millennia were destroyed, fields of crops were burned, and economic infrastructure was demolished beyond repair.[^51] Entire regions were depopulated, and some areas would not recover their pre-Mongol population levels for centuries. Libraries containing irreplaceable manuscripts—the accumulated knowledge of Islamic civilization—were burned, resulting in an incalculable loss to human heritage.[^52]

### Targeting of Civilian Populations

Unlike military campaigns focused primarily on defeating armed forces, Hulagu's conquests systematically targeted civilian populations as part of a deliberate strategy of terror.[^53] The week-long massacre following Baghdad's surrender exemplifies this approach: the killing continued even after military resistance had ceased, with non-combatants bearing the brunt of Mongol violence. Historical sources describe indiscriminate slaughter of men, women, and children, with only some Christian communities spared due to the intercession of Hulagu's Christian wife, Doquz Khatun.[^54]

### Cultural and Religious Iconoclasm

The deliberate destruction of cultural and religious sites represents another dimension of controversy. The House of Wisdom in Baghdad, which had preserved and expanded upon Greek, Persian, and Indian scientific and philosophical works, was destroyed along with countless other centers of learning.[^55] Mosques, theological colleges, and hospitals that had served their communities for centuries were systematically demolished. Some historians argue that Hulagu "did more than anyone else to destroy medieval Iranian culture," though this assessment must be balanced against the later cultural flourishing under the Ilkhanate.[^56]

### Ethnic and Religious Discrimination

Hulagu's religious policies favored Buddhists and Christians over Muslims, creating deep resentment and long-lasting tensions in his territories.[^57] While his tolerance toward Christians stemmed partly from familial influences—his mother and principal wife were both Nestorian Christians—this preferential treatment was perceived as deliberate humiliation by Muslim subjects who formed the overwhelming majority of the population in his domains.

### Diplomatic Brutality

Hulagu's treatment of envoys and diplomatic negotiations violated even the harsh norms of 13th-century warfare. When the Mamluk Sultan Qutuz responded to Hulagu's demands for Egypt's surrender, Qutuz had the Mongol envoys killed and their heads displayed on the Bab Zuweila gate of Cairo.[^58] This execution, while shocking, was itself a response to Hulagu's threatening correspondence and his established pattern of utterly annihilating cities that resisted Mongol demands.

### Long-term Political Fragmentation

The abolition of the Abbasid Caliphate created a political and religious vacuum in the Islamic world that was never fully resolved.[^59] While Abbasid authority had been declining for centuries, the caliphate provided symbolic unity and religious legitimacy to Muslim rulers across vast distances. Its elimination accelerated the political fragmentation of the Islamic world and shifted power balances, particularly strengthening the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, which would become the new center of Islamic political authority.

## Personal Life

### Family Background and Siblings

As the son of Tolui and Sorghaghtani Beki, Hulagu belonged to one of the most powerful families in world history.[^60] His brothers included some of the era's most significant rulers: Möngke Khan, who became the fourth Khagan of the Mongol Empire; Kublai Khan, who would establish the Yuan Dynasty in China; and Ariq Böke, who contested succession with Kublai after Möngke's death.[^61] This fraternal network placed Hulagu at the center of Mongol power politics and provided him with crucial support for his western campaigns.

### Marriages and Wives

Hulagu had fourteen wives and concubines, reflecting the polygamous practices of Mongol nobility.[^62] His principal wife, Doquz Khatun (died 1265), was a Nestorian Christian princess of the Keraite tribe and the granddaughter of the powerful Wang Khan (Toghrul).[^63] According to Mongol custom, Doquz had originally been married to Hulagu's father Tolui in 1232, shortly before Tolui's death, and was then passed on to Hulagu as his primary consort.[^64]

Doquz Khatun wielded considerable influence over Hulagu and his policies. Before the conquest of Baghdad, the Great Khan Möngke specifically advised Hulagu to heed Doquz's counsel, and her intercession is credited with persuading Hulagu to spare Christian communities during the massacre of Baghdad's inhabitants.[^65] She established a mobile church equipped with bells within her ordo (royal camp), enabling the practice of Christian worship amid the nomadic Ilkhanid court.[^66] Her death in 1265, shortly after Hulagu's own demise, was deeply mourned throughout the empire, testifying to her significant role in Ilkhanate politics and religious affairs.[^67]

### Children and Succession

Hulagu fathered at least 21 children from his various marriages.[^68] His most significant sons were Abaqa, who succeeded him as the second Ilkhan, ruling from 1265 to 1282; Teguder Ahmad, who became the third Ilkhan from 1282 to 1284 after converting to Islam; and Taraqai, whose son Baydu would briefly rule as Ilkhan in 1295.[^69] The succession of Abaqa established Hulagu's direct lineage as the ruling dynasty of the Ilkhanate, ensuring his political legacy extended beyond his lifetime.

### Religious Beliefs and Buddhist Faith

Although Hulagu was generally favorable to Christianity due to familial influences, he was personally a devout Buddhist following the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism.[^70] This religious orientation was relatively uncommon among Mongol rulers of his generation but reflected the religious diversity within the imperial family. His Buddhist faith influenced his patronage decisions and his worldview, though he maintained the traditional Mongol policy of religious pragmatism, supporting multiple faiths simultaneously for political advantage.[^71]

Some sources indicate that Hulagu converted to Buddhism or reaffirmed his commitment to the faith as he neared death, though his wife Doquz Khatun reportedly opposed this decision, hoping he would embrace Christianity instead.[^72] His funeral on Shahi Island in Lake Urmia was the only Ilkhanate funeral to feature human sacrifice, suggesting a blend of Buddhist, traditional Mongol, and perhaps shamanistic elements in his final rites.[^73]

### Personality and Character

Historical sources paint a complex portrait of Hulagu's personality. Mongol traditions emphasized that Möngke Khan ordered Hulagu to "treat kindly those who submitted, and utterly destroy those who did not," and Hulagu vigorously carried out the latter part of these instructions.[^74] This suggests a commander who was ruthlessly efficient in executing his mandate, showing no mercy to those who resisted Mongol authority.

Yet Hulagu was not merely a destroyer. Unlike some of his predecessors, he sought to govern and rebuild the territories he conquered.[^75] He promoted trade, agriculture, and the arts within his domains, and his court became a cultural crossroads hosting Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and representatives of other faiths.[^76] His patronage of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and the Maragheh Observatory demonstrates intellectual curiosity and appreciation for scientific advancement.[^77]

## Legacy

### Immediate Political Impact

Hulagu Khan's conquests fundamentally reshaped the political landscape of the Middle East and Southwest Asia. The destruction of the Abbasid Caliphate eliminated an institution that had provided symbolic unity to the Islamic world for over five centuries.[^78] While the caliphate's political power had diminished significantly in preceding centuries, its abolition created a legitimacy vacuum that contributed to the political fragmentation of Muslim lands. The shift of Islamic political and religious influence to the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo represented a permanent geographic reorientation of power within the Islamic world.[^79]

The establishment of the Ilkhanate created a new political entity that would govern Persia and surrounding regions until 1335.[^80] This state introduced Mongol military administration and governance practices to a region with ancient Persian bureaucratic traditions, creating a hybrid system that influenced subsequent Iranian political development. The Ilkhanate unified much of Iran following several centuries of political fragmentation, establishing patterns of centralized authority that later dynasties would emulate.[^81]

### Cultural and Intellectual Consequences

The destruction of Baghdad and its libraries represents one of history's great cultural catastrophes, with incalculable losses to human knowledge.[^82] The House of Wisdom and countless other repositories of learning were destroyed, eliminating manuscripts that recorded centuries of scientific, philosophical, and literary achievement. This loss was particularly devastating because many texts existed in unique copies and represented knowledge accumulated from Greek, Persian, Indian, and early Islamic sources.

However, the longer-term cultural impact was more nuanced than simple destruction. The Ilkhanate, under Hulagu and his successors, eventually became a significant patron of learning and the arts.[^83] The Maragheh Observatory produced important astronomical work and attracted scholars from across Asia.[^84] Under Hulagu's dynasty, Iranian historians began writing in Persian rather than Arabic, a shift that contributed to a revival of pride in Iran's ancient cultural legacy and fostered the development of a distinctive Persian literary and cultural tradition.[^85]

### Foundation of Modern Iran

Perhaps Hulagu's most lasting legacy was laying the foundations that would eventually lead to the modern nation of Iran.[^86] By ending centuries of political fragmentation and establishing centralized rule over a territory roughly corresponding to historic Persia, the Ilkhanate created administrative and territorial precedents that subsequent dynasties would build upon. The Ilkhanate's adoption of Islam under Hulagu's successors, and particularly the eventual establishment of Twelver Shi'a Islam as a distinctive Iranian expression of the faith, created religious and cultural patterns that define Iran to this day.[^87]

The dynasty's promotion of Persian language and culture, its patronage of Persian arts and literature, and its integration of Mongol military traditions with Persian administrative practices created a synthesis that influenced the later Safavid dynasty (1501-1736) and ultimately the modern Iranian state.[^88] In this sense, Hulagu inadvertently contributed to the preservation and renewal of Persian identity even as he destroyed much of its medieval cultural heritage.

### Military and Strategic Legacy

From a military perspective, Hulagu demonstrated the effectiveness of combined-arms warfare, integrating cavalry tactics with Chinese siege engineering and systematic logistics.[^89] His campaigns showed both the overwhelming power of Mongol military organization at its peak and its limitations—the defeat at Ain Jalut in 1260 established that Mongol armies were not invincible and could be defeated by forces employing appropriate tactics and strategy.[^90]

The Berke-Hulagu War (1262-1265) marked a crucial turning point in Mongol history, as it represented the first major military conflict between different branches of Genghis Khan's empire.[^91] This civil war contributed significantly to the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire into separate khanates that would increasingly pursue independent policies, ending the era of unified Mongol expansion.

### Religious and Demographic Changes

Hulagu's campaigns had profound demographic consequences for the Middle East. The massacres and destruction depopulated entire regions, with some areas requiring centuries to recover their pre-Mongol population levels.[^92] The destruction of irrigation systems and agricultural infrastructure in Mesopotamia had particularly long-lasting effects, contributing to the economic decline of a region that had been one of the world's most prosperous agricultural zones since ancient times.[^93]

The religious landscape was also permanently altered. The elimination of the Abbasid Caliphate and the subsequent weakening of Sunni institutional structures, combined with the Ilkhanate's eventual adoption of Islam and later support for Shi'a interpretations, contributed to sectarian realignments whose effects remain visible in modern Middle Eastern religious geography.[^94]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some historians and scholars recognize Hulagu Khan as a transformative figure who, despite his destructive methods, initiated significant positive changes in the regions he conquered.[^95] For Persians and certain historians, he represents a leader who ended centuries of feudal fragmentation and initiated an era of centralized rule that ultimately benefited political stability and economic development.[^96]

The Persian historian Juvayni, who traveled with Hulagu's army, described his victory over the Nizari Ismailis in glowing terms, portraying Hulagu as a "sword of Islam" carrying out God's will against a heretical sect that had terrorized the Muslim world for decades.[^97] Juvayni's account presents Hulagu's campaigns as a more "civilized" form of conquest compared to the earlier campaigns of Genghis Khan, suggesting that Hulagu demonstrated greater discrimination in his use of violence and more interest in governance rather than mere plunder.[^98]

Modern scholars have highlighted Hulagu's patronage of science and learning as evidence of his multifaceted character. His establishment of the Maragheh Observatory represented a significant contribution to astronomical knowledge and demonstrated commitment to scientific advancement.[^99] His support for Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, one of the era's greatest scientists, enabled important research that influenced both Islamic and later European astronomy.[^100]

The administrative and governmental structures established by the Ilkhanate contributed to what historians have described as a "Persian Renaissance."[^101] The dynasty's eventual adoption of Islam and patronage of Persian arts and literature fostered a flourishing of Persian culture that influenced the region for centuries.[^102] The shift from Arabic to Persian as the primary language of historical writing under Hulagu's dynasty contributed to a revival of Iranian cultural identity and pride in ancient Persian heritage.[^103]

From a political perspective, Hulagu's unification of Iran created a template for centralized governance that subsequent Iranian dynasties would emulate and build upon, ultimately contributing to the formation of the modern Iranian state.[^104] His promotion of trade, agriculture, and infrastructure development—once initial conquests were complete—demonstrated capacity for constructive governance beyond mere military conquest.[^105]

### Negative Views

In the Islamic world, Hulagu Khan is overwhelmingly remembered as one of history's great villains, responsible for unprecedented destruction of Muslim civilization.[^106] The sack of Baghdad in 1258 is viewed as both a military catastrophe and a cultural apocalypse that ended the Islamic Golden Age and destroyed centuries of accumulated knowledge.[^107] Contemporary Muslim chroniclers described his campaigns in apocalyptic terms, viewing them as divine punishment for the sins of the age.

Modern historians critical of Hulagu emphasize the scale of human suffering his campaigns caused. Estimates of deaths during his conquests range from hundreds of thousands to millions, with entire cities experiencing massacres of their populations.[^108] The deliberate targeting of civilian populations and systematic destruction of cultural infrastructure represent what some scholars characterize as genocidal policies designed to terrorize populations into submission.[^109]

The destruction of libraries and centers of learning constitutes one of history's great cultural losses. Some historians argue that Hulagu "did more than anyone else to destroy medieval Iranian culture," eliminating manuscripts and architectural monuments that represented irreplaceable heritage.[^110] The burning of the Alamut library and Baghdad's House of Wisdom destroyed unique texts that might have advanced human knowledge in ways we can never recover or assess.

Environmental and economic historians have documented the long-term damage Hulagu's campaigns inflicted on Mesopotamian agriculture and irrigation systems.[^111] The destruction of complex hydraulic infrastructure that had taken centuries to develop contributed to the economic decline of regions that had been prosperous since ancient times. Some areas affected by Mongol destruction never fully recovered their agricultural productivity, with consequences lasting into the modern era.

Religious scholars and historians emphasize how Hulagu's elimination of the Abbasid Caliphate created a religious and political crisis in the Islamic world.[^112] The execution of the caliph—spiritual leader of Sunni Islam—was viewed as sacrilege and contributed to lasting trauma in Islamic historical memory. The political fragmentation that followed the caliphate's destruction weakened the Islamic world's ability to respond to subsequent challenges, including later Crusades and eventually European colonialism.

Critics also point to Hulagu's role in initiating the Mongol civil wars through his conflicts with his cousin Berke Khan of the Golden Horde.[^113] These internal Mongol conflicts, fought partly over Hulagu's destruction of Muslim lands, contributed to the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire and resulted in additional warfare and suffering across Eurasia.

The assessment of Hulagu Khan as "not merely a brutal conqueror but a transformative figure" remains deeply contested.[^114] While acknowledging his role in reshaping political structures and inadvertently contributing to later cultural developments, critics maintain that these outcomes cannot justify or mitigate the immense human suffering his campaigns caused. The transformation he initiated came at a cost measured in millions of lives and incalculable cultural losses that humanity will never recover.
