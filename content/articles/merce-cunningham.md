## Summary

Merce Cunningham was an American dancer and choreographer who revolutionized modern dance by separating movement from music and narrative. His collaborations with John Cage, Robert Rauschenberg, and other artists created some of the most important works of postwar art. His use of chance operations and later computer software challenged every assumption about dance.
