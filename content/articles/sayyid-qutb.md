## Summary

Sayyid Ibrahim Husayn Shadhili Qutb (1906-1966) was an Egyptian political theorist, Islamic scholar, and leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood who profoundly influenced modern Islamist ideology. Initially a secular literary critic and educator, he underwent a radical transformation in the late 1940s to become one of the most influential Islamist thinkers of the twentieth century. His concepts of jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic ignorance) and hakimiyyah (God's sovereignty) revolutionized political Islam, inspiring movements from the Muslim Brotherhood to al-Qaeda. Executed by hanging under Nasser's regime in 1966 after being convicted of plotting to assassinate the Egyptian president, Qutb became a martyr whose ideas continue to shape Islamic political movements worldwide.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Sayyid Qutb was born on October 9, 1906, in the village of Musha, located in Upper Egypt's Asyut Province. His father, whose sixth great-grandfather was an Indian Muslim, was an Upper Egyptian landowner and administrator of the family estate, well known for his political activism and for holding weekly meetings to discuss political events and Qur'anic recitation. His mother, Fātimah Husayn 'Uthmān, had a particular love for the Qur'an and was determined that her children should all become huffāz (memorizers of the holy book). She would invite professional Koran reciters to their home during the month of Ramadan, and young Sayyid would listen to the sacred verses at his mother's side.[^3][^4]

The family, which traces its ancestry ultimately to Central Asia via India, consisted of father and mother, two brothers and three sisters, of whom Sayyid Qutb was the eldest. His brother Muhammad and two of his sisters, Aminah and Hamidah, were also writers active in Islamic causes; all suffered arrest for their views along with their brother in 1965.[^5]

At a young age, Sayyid first learned about melodic recitations of the Qur'an, which would fuel the artistic side of his personality. By age 10, he had memorized the entire Qur'an while studying at the village kuttab (religious school). At age 13 he moved to Cairo for further study and entered the Dar al-'Ulum secondary school (established 1872), which offered an essentially secular education with the purpose of preparing students for government employment.[^6][^7]

Between 1929 and 1933, Qutb received an education based on the British style of schooling before starting his career as a teacher in the Ministry of Public Instruction. From 1933 to 1952 he worked in the Ministry of Education, first as a teacher and later as an inspector and administrator. During this period, he also became one of the secular literary elite prominent at the time, publishing more than 100 poems as well as articles and books on literary and social topics.[^8][^9]

---

## Rise to Prominence

Qutb's early career was entirely secular and literary. He wrote his first article in the literary magazine al-Balagh in 1922, while still a teenager, and his first book, "Muhimmat al-Sha'ir fi al-Haya wa Shi'r al-Jil al-Hadir" (The Mission of the Poet in Life and the Poetry of the Present Generation), in 1932, when he was 25. His early writings included novels such as "Ashwak" (Thorns), essays, poems, and various autobiographical pieces. He even helped elevate Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz from obscurity.[^10][^11]

The pivotal transformation in Qutb's life occurred during his two-year sojourn in the United States from 1948 to 1950. Qutb was sent to America by Egypt's Ministry of Education, ostensibly to study American educational systems and curricula, though this was partly arranged by concerned friends to ensure his safety after his writings drew unfavorable attention from the Egyptian government. He departed Egypt in November 1948 and spent the Christmas season in New York City, then studied English at Wilson's Teachers College in Washington, D.C., before traveling to Greeley, Colorado in June 1949, where he spent six months at Colorado State College of Education (now the University of Northern Colorado).[^12][^13]

Despite Greeley being a conservative town founded on principles of temperance, moral uprightness, tolerance, cooperation, family, religion, education, agriculture and irrigation, Qutb saw things that others did not. He seethed at what he perceived as the brutishness and materialism of American society, condemning even trivial cultural differences. What he witnessed prompted him to condemn America as a soulless, materialistic place that no Muslim should aspire to live in. He documented his observations in his 1951 essay, "The America I Have Seen," which revealed his profound disillusionment with Western civilization.[^14][^15]

Qutb cut short his stay in America and returned to Egypt in 1951, shortly after the assassination of Hassan al-Banna, founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, which occurred on February 12, 1949. Disgusted by what he perceived as the moral bankruptcy of Western society, Qutb joined the Muslim Brotherhood in 1951 upon his return to Egypt. While he never worked directly under al-Banna's leadership, Qutb played a crucial role in theorizing jihad and militancy within the organization.[^16][^17]

In 1948, Qutb rather abruptly began to publish Islamist articles, and the next year published his first major theoretical work of religious social criticism, "Al-'adala al-Ijtima'iyya fi-l-Islam" (Social Justice in Islam), during his time in the West. The book articulated for the first time a major and widely felt concern of the Muslim world and has been translated into numerous Islamic languages, including Persian, Turkish, Urdu, and Malay/Indonesian.[^18][^19]

---

## Major Achievements

Sayyid Qutb authored 24 published books, with around 30 unpublished for different reasons (mainly destruction by the state), and at least 581 articles, including novels, literary arts critique and works on education. His most influential contributions to Islamic political thought came through his major works written during and after his time in prison.[^20]

**In the Shade of the Qur'an (Fi Zilal al-Qur'an)**

His magnum opus, this 30-volume commentary on the Qur'an was written during 1951-1965, with most of the original volumes written while in prison following an attempted assassination of Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1954. The first volume was published in 1952. This highly influential commentary represents Qutb's mature theological and political thought, encompassing his radically anti-secular and anti-Western claims.[^21][^22]

**Milestones (Ma'alim fi al-Tariq)**

First published in 1964, Milestones is probably Qutb's most famous and influential work and one of the most influential Islamist tracts ever written. In this short book, Qutb makes a call to action and lays out a plan to re-create the "extinct" Muslim world on strictly Quranic grounds, casting off what he calls Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic ignorance). Written in prison, where Qutb spent 10 years under charges of political conspiracy, excerpts from the book were used to incriminate him and he was found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in 1966. Four of the thirteen chapters of Milestones were originally written for his Quranic commentary, Fi Zilal al-Qur'an.[^23][^24]

**Revolutionary Concepts**

Qutb's best known and most distinctive doctrine is his interpretation of jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic ignorance) as characterizing all of the societies of his time, including the Muslim ones. He claimed that contemporary societies, both Islamic and non-Islamic, are in a state of jahiliyyah resembling the 'state of ignorance' of pre-Islamic Arab societies because they are organized on the basis of man-made laws instead of the Shariah bequeathed by God to humanity through Prophet Muhammad.[^25][^26]

Another central doctrine was his interpretation of faith in one God only (tawhid) as entailing the absolute sovereignty of God (hakimiyyat Allah) and the liberation of humans from service to other humans instead of God. In his vision of the Islamic State of hakimiyyah, God is the supreme legislator, the justice and the ultimate source of governmental and legal authority. God does not descend to govern, but descended his shari'ah (law) to govern.[^27][^28]

**The Revolutionary Vanguard Theory**

Qutb advocated for a revolutionary vanguard to fight jahiliyyah with a twofold approach: preaching, and using "physical power and jihad" to "abolish" the organizations and authorities of the Jahili system. His vision calls for a counter-society (jamaah) to combat jahiliyya and establish a true Islamic state. While Hassan al-Banna had sought the Islamization of the Egyptian people before the creation of an Islamic state, Qutb went further, suggesting that an Islamic state should be established by a revolutionary vanguard that would Islamize the state from above. This program bears resemblance to Vladimir Lenin's conception of revolution, with scholars identifying what they call Qutb's "Leninist background."[^29][^30][^31]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Following an alleged assassination attempt on Nasser by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood in October 1954, Qutb was arrested and severely tortured, despite his frail health. During his first three years in prison, conditions were bad and Qutb was tortured. He was exhausted from torture after two months of incarceration, was made to stand for six hours in inhumane positions before court, and took off his shirt in the courtroom to show the traces of torture on his back—Sayyid Qutb and his cellmates had been whipped and subjected to psychological abuse.[^32][^33]

In 1954 he was accused of conspiring to assassinate President Nasser and was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment. Many, including Sayyid Qutb and Zaynab al-Ghazali, were tortured for months during the 1965 crackdown when about 18,000 people were arrested, 100–200 were imprisoned, and 38 of these were killed in custody during the investigation. One common explanation for Qutb's radicalization is that the conditions he witnessed in prison from 1954 to 1964, including the torture and murder of the Muslim Brotherhood members, convinced him that only a government bound by Islamic law could prevent such abuses.[^34][^35]

Qutb was released from prison in December 1964, probably due to ill health. However, as Milestones' circulation spread rapidly, he was rearrested in August 1965 and sentenced to death for sedition. On August 21, 1966, Qutb was found guilty by an Egyptian court. Despite international appeals to spare his life, he was hanged on August 29, 1966.[^36][^37]

**Academic and Religious Criticism**

Moderate Muslims questioned Qutb's understanding of sharia, particularly that it is not only perfect and complete, but completely accessible to people and thus the solution to any of their problems. Also criticized is his dismissal of not only all non-Muslim culture, but many centuries of Muslim learning, culture and beauty following the first four caliphs as un-Islamic and thus worthless. Islamic scholar and moderate Abou el Fadl complained that "neither Qutb nor Mawdudi were trained jurists, and their knowledge of the Islamic jurisprudential tradition was minimal."[^38][^39]

The ulama of Al-Azhar University school took the unusual step following his death of putting Sayyid Qutb on their index of heresy, declaring him a "deviant" (munharif). Salafi scholars like Albani, Rabee bin Hadi, Ibn Baz, Ibn Jibreen, Ibn Uthaymeen, Saalih al-Fawzan, and Muqbil ibn Hadi condemned Qutb as a heretic for takfiri views. Many Muslim leaders felt that Qutb had gone too far, and his influential work Milestones was denounced both by the spiritual leader of the Ikhwan and by Al-Azhar University, which condemned the book as heretical.[^40][^41]

Iranian Shi'ite clerics such as Abū Faḍl Raẓavī Ardakānī, Sayyid Ibrāhīm Mīlānī, and Morteza Mutahhari wrote several treatises opposing the ideas of Qutb, his anti-clerical rhetoric and condemned those who spread his works in Iran. Most of the participants expressed negative views on Qutb, considering him as a proponent of extremist ideas.[^42]

---

## Personal Life

Qutb never married, in part because of his steadfast religious convictions. Since he never married, Sayyid Qutb had no children. He was the eldest of his siblings, with a brother Muhammad and sisters Aminah and Hamidah. His brother Muhammad became particularly influential after Sayyid's death, moving to Saudi Arabia following his release from prison in Egypt and becoming a professor of Islamic Studies. Muhammad edited, published and promoted his brother Sayyid's work, and the influence on al-Qaeda was felt through Sayyid's writing, his followers and especially through Muhammad Qutb.[^43][^44][^45]

Qutb suffered from respiratory and other health problems throughout his life, and was known for "his introvertedness, isolation, depression and concern." In appearance he was described as "pale with sleepy eyes."[^46]

Despite his later denunciation of his early secular works, Qutb's autobiography of his childhood "Tifl min al-Qarya" (A Child From the Village) makes little mention of Islam or political theory and is typically classified as a secular, literary work that provides insights into his formative years in rural Egypt.[^47]

## Legacy

Sayyid Qutb has been described as a key originator of Islamist ideology and inspiration for violent Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda, and is widely regarded as one of the most influential Muslim thinkers or activists of the modern era. Alongside notable Islamists like Abul A'la Mawdudi, Hasan al-Banna, and Ruhollah Khomeini, Qutb is considered one of the most leading Islamist ideologues of the twentieth century, not only for his ideas but also for what many see as his martyr's death.[^48][^49]

**Influence on Al-Qaeda and Global Jihadism**

His writings—particularly Milestones and In the Shade of the Quran—are believed to have inspired the leaders of future Islamist terror groups, including al-Qaeda founders Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri. Osama bin Laden was acquainted with Sayyid's brother, Muhammad Qutb, and regularly attended weekly public lectures by Muhammad Qutb at King Abdulaziz University, reading Sayyid Qutb's works. The 9/11 Commission Report cites Qutb for influencing Osama bin Laden's worldview.[^50][^51][^52]

Ayman al-Zawahiri, one of Qutb's students, went on to become a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and later a mentor of Osama bin Laden and a leading member of al-Qaeda. Al-Zawahiri began his decades-long path of terrorism in 1966, inspired by Qutb's message and then outraged by his execution. He asserted that Qutb's execution lit "the jihadist fire" and reshaped the direction of the Islamist movement. Al-Zawahiri saw Qutb as a revolutionary and a martyr whom he aspired to emulate, and almost every publication by al-Zawahiri included admiring references to Sayyid Qutb and his contribution to modern Islamic revival.[^53][^54][^55]

**Ideological Foundations of Modern Islamism**

Strengthened by his status as a martyr, Qutb's ideas on Jahiliyya and his close linking of implementation of sharia with Tawhid has highly influenced contemporary Islamist and Jihadist movements. As Muslim jihad volunteers from around the world exchanged religious ideas during the Afghan-Soviet War, Qutbism merged with Salafism and Wahhabism, culminating in the formation of Salafi jihadism. Qutbism has gained prominence due to its influence on notable Jihadist figures of contemporary era such as Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Saif al-Adel.[^56][^57]

**Continuing Influence**

The image of him as the man who stood up for his ideas, and died without renouncing them, led many people, in particular Islamist youth, to read his work with admiration and respect. Over the decades following his execution, Qutb refined a violent political theology from the raw anti-modernism of his American interlude, and a direct line of influence runs from Sayyid Qutb to Osama bin Laden and to bin Laden's Egyptian partner in terror, Ayman al-Zawahiri.[^58][^59]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

**Defenders and Admirers in Islamist Movements**

Saudi Arabian Islamic scholar Hamud ibn Uqla Ash-Shu'aybi, the leader of the Shu'aybi school, wrote an influential treatise "A Word of Truth on Sayyid Qutb" defending Sayyid Qutb from his theological opponents. Ibn Uqla praised Qutb as a "Mujaddid" (renewer of the faith), and extolled Qutb as a martyr who upheld Tawhid and defended sharia in the face of tyrants.[^60]

Within the Muslim Brotherhood, the establishment Banni factions favour a gradualist approach to establish Islamic states through mainstream political participation, but also strongly defend Qutb's legacy to shore up support from their conservative base. Qutbist ideologues continue to exert inordinate influence in various echelons of the Muslim Brotherhood.[^61]

American Salafi preacher Ali al-Tamimi, considered "arguably the first American born activist Salafi preacher", has Qutb as one of his main intellectual influences. The Yemeni Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki also cited Qutb's writings as formative to his ideology. Even the current Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, translated his work into Persian, demonstrating Qutb's influence across different Islamic movements and sectarian divides.[^62][^63]

**Scholarly Recognition**

Academic scholars have produced extensive research recognizing Qutb's intellectual significance. John Calvert's "Sayyid Qutb and the Origins of Radical Islamism" (Columbia University Press, 2010) provides excellent and clear treatment of Qutb's whole life and the development of his thinking, based on painstaking research into Arabic sources with extensive archival research in Egypt. James Toth's "Sayyid Qutb: The Life and Legacy of a Radical Islamic Intellectual" (Oxford University Press) traces the life and thought of Qutb, giving attention not only to his well-known Signposts on the Road, but also to his less-studied works.[^64][^65]

Giedre Šabaseviciute's "Sayyid Qutb" (Syracuse University Press), which won the 2022 Czech Academy of Sciences Book Award, draws upon unexplored material on Qutb's life—book reviews, criticism, intellectual collaborations, memoirs, and personal interviews with his former acquaintances—and unveils the unexplored dimensions of Qutb's involvement in Cairo's burgeoning cultural scene.[^66]

### Negative Views

**Western and Secular Criticism**

Many Western observers and some Muslims see Qutb as a key originator of Islamist ideology and an inspiration for violent Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda. His critical reinterpretation of classical Islamic ideas jahiliyyah and hakimiyyah articulates a radical division of the world into Muslim and non-Muslim societies, while posing an alternative to secular notions of sovereignty that many scholars find troubling.[^67]

Qutb has been criticized by traditional scholars on particular points of fiqh and history and generally for making judgments about religion without the sort of training they consider necessary. Conservative criticism went further, condemning Qutb's Islamist/reformist ideas proposed in his earlier works in the 1950s such as "Social Justice in Islam" – like social justice and redistributive economics, banning of slavery – as "western" and bid'ah or innovative.[^68]

**Condemnation by Islamic Authorities**

The most significant religious condemnation came from Al-Azhar University, one of Islam's oldest and most prestigious institutions of learning. The ulama of Al-Azhar took the unusual step following his death of putting Sayyid Qutb on their index of heresy, declaring him a "deviant" (munharif). Many Muslim leaders felt that Qutb had gone too far, and his influential work Milestones was denounced both by the spiritual leader of the Ikhwan and by Al-Azhar University, which condemned the book as heretical.[^69]

Multiple prominent Salafi scholars condemned Qutb as a heretic for his takfiri views (declaring other Muslims as apostates). Scholars like Albani, Rabee bin Hadi, Ibn Baz, Ibn Jibreen, Ibn Uthaymeen, Saalih al-Fawzan, and Muqbil ibn Hadi all rejected Qutb's interpretations of Islamic doctrine.[^70]

Iranian Shi'ite clerics were particularly critical. Scholars such as Abū Faḍl Raẓavī Ardakānī, Sayyid Ibrāhīm Mīlānī, and Morteza Mutahhari wrote several treatises opposing the ideas of Qutb, his anti-clerical rhetoric and condemned those who spread his works in Iran. Most Iranian religious scholars expressed negative views on Qutb, considering him as a proponent of extremist ideas.[^71]
