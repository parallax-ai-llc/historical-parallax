## Summary

Wally Amos founded Famous Amos cookies in 1975, creating one of the first celebrity brand food companies. He was a talent agent who turned his passion for baking into a nationally recognized brand. He lost control of the Famous Amos brand and his right to use his own name in a business deal. He later founded Uncle Wally's Muffins and Chip & Cookie. His story is both an entrepreneurial triumph and a cautionary tale about brand ownership.
