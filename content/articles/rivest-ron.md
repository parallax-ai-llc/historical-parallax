## Summary

Ron Rivest co-invented the RSA public-key cryptosystem with Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman in 1977, which became the most widely used encryption algorithm. RSA security is based on the practical difficulty of factoring large prime numbers. He received the 2002 Turing Award and also designed the widely-used MD5 hash function.
