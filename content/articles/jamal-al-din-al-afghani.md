## Summary

Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838–1897) was a pioneering Islamic modernist, political activist, and philosopher who championed pan-Islamism and resistance to Western imperialism across the Muslim world.[^1] Despite his adopted name "al-Afghani," scholarly evidence suggests he was born in Asadabad, Persia (modern-day Iran) into a Shiite family, though he presented himself as Sunni Afghan to gain wider acceptance.[^2] He traveled extensively throughout the Islamic world—including India, Afghanistan, Egypt, Turkey, Iran, and Europe—spreading his vision of Muslim unity and modernization.[^3] His influence extended through his renowned student Muhammad Abduh, their groundbreaking newspaper Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa, and his role in major political movements including the 1891 Iranian Tobacco Protest and his alleged involvement in the assassination of Shah Nasir al-Din.[^4] Al-Afghani remains a controversial yet foundational figure in Islamic political thought, embodying the tensions between religious tradition and modernity, reform and revolution.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

The circumstances of Jamal al-Din al-Afghani's birth remain one of the most enduring controversies in Islamic intellectual history.[^6] According to the pioneering research of scholar Nikki Keddie, now accepted by most modern historians, he was born in 1838 in Asadabad, a small town near Hamadan in Persia (Iran), into a Turkic-speaking Shiite family.[^7] However, al-Afghani himself consistently claimed Afghan origins, presenting himself as having been born in Asadabad, Afghanistan—a different town with the same name—and as a Sunni Muslim.[^8] This self-fashioned identity was likely strategic: in the predominantly Sunni Muslim world where he sought influence, Persian Shiite origins could have undermined his authority and pan-Islamic message.[^9]

Very little is definitively known about al-Afghani's family or upbringing, as he left few personal records and cultivated an aura of mystery throughout his life.[^10] What is clear is that he received an exceptional education in Islamic sciences, philosophy, and mysticism during his youth.[^11] In 1855-56, as a young man of approximately seventeen, he traveled to India to continue his advanced studies.[^12] This journey proved formative in ways that would shape his entire political worldview.

Al-Afghani arrived in India during one of the most turbulent periods in its history—the great uprising of 1857-1858, known variously as the Sepoy Mutiny or the First War of Independence.[^13] As a twenty-year-old witness to these revolutionary events, he observed how Muslims and Hindus successfully cooperated in opposing British colonial domination.[^14] He saw firsthand the power of religion to mobilize diverse local groups for anti-imperial purposes, a lesson that would become central to his later activism.[^15] Equally important, he witnessed the devastating aftermath: the systematic destruction of Muslim political power in India and the discriminatory policies that followed, with Muslims being excluded from government appointments and marginalized in religious and educational institutions.[^16]

These formative experiences in India instilled in the young al-Afghani a profound awareness of British imperialism's threat to the Islamic world and convinced him that Muslim unity—transcending sectarian and ethnic divisions—was essential for survival and resistance.[^17] The destruction he witnessed would haunt him throughout his career, driving his untiring quest for Muslim solidarity against Western encroachment.[^18]

## Rise to Prominence

Al-Afghani's emergence as a major political figure began in Afghanistan in 1866, though his time there was brief and tempestuous.[^19] At the end of 1866, he appeared in Kandahar during the power struggle between rival claimants to the Afghan throne.[^20] He immediately became the confidential counselor to Amir Muhammad A'zam Khan, following him to Kabul when A'zam captured the capital.[^21] In this capacity, al-Afghani vigorously advocated for Afghanistan to resist British influence and expansion, urging the emir to take a confrontational stance against British imperial designs in the region.[^22]

However, al-Afghani's political influence proved short-lived. In 1868, when a new emir came to power, al-Afghani was expelled from Afghanistan—the only time he would actually visit the country whose name he had adopted.[^23] This pattern of gaining rapid influence followed by forced exile would repeat throughout his career, as rulers initially attracted to his charisma and intellect became wary of his revolutionary ideas and political agitation.[^24]

Following his expulsion from Afghanistan, al-Afghani traveled to Istanbul in 1869, where he was initially well-received and even invited to give public lectures.[^25] However, his provocative ideas soon aroused the suspicion of the Ottoman religious establishment, and he was expelled from Turkey in 1871.[^26] This rejection sent him to Egypt, where he would spend the most intellectually productive period of his life and establish his greatest legacy.[^27]

From 1871 to 1879, al-Afghani resided in Cairo, teaching philosophy at Al-Azhar University and attracting a devoted circle of young intellectuals and Islamic scholars who studied at this leading institution of Sunni learning.[^28] Through his classes, public lectures, and informal gatherings, he developed and disseminated his vision of Islamic modernism—the idea that traditional Islamic culture could find a modus vivendi with the philosophical and scientific challenges of the modern West.[^29] During this period, he met a young student who would become his most devoted disciple and intellectual heir: Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), who later became the leading figure of the Islamic modernist movement.[^30]

Al-Afghani's Egyptian period was marked by increasingly bold political activism. He used Freemasonry—which he had joined at the Lodge of the Pyramids in Alexandria in 1864—as an organizational base for his political activities, viewing it as a means to advance his anti-colonial and pan-Islamic causes.[^31] He sought the removal of Khedive Isma'il Pasha's regime, which he viewed as pro-British and subservient to foreign interests.[^32] However, after realizing that the Freemasons were politically allied with the British Empire rather than opposed to it, he eventually left the organization.[^33]

By 1879, al-Afghani's revolutionary agitation had become intolerable to the Egyptian authorities, and he was forced to leave the country.[^34] He settled briefly in Hyderabad, India, before continuing his peripatetic career across the Muslim world and Europe.[^35]

## Major Achievements

Al-Afghani's most enduring achievement was developing the ideological framework for Islamic modernism and political pan-Islamism that continues to influence Muslim political thought today.[^36] His central insight was that Islam and its revealed law were compatible with rationality, meaning Muslims could achieve political unity and modernization while maintaining their faith and religious social morality.[^37] He argued that the Muslim world's decline was not caused by contact with the West, but that Western pressure revealed a long-dormant but essential element of Islamic tradition: rational, scientific thought.[^38] This reinterpretation challenged both conservative Muslims who rejected all Western innovations and secularists who believed Islam was incompatible with progress.[^39]

His political program of pan-Islamism, which he called "ittihad-i islam" (Islamic unity), sought to mobilize Muslim nations to fight against Western imperialism while gaining military and technological power through modern science.[^40] Unlike nationalists who organized resistance along ethnic or linguistic lines, al-Afghani feared that nationalism would divide the Muslim world and insisted that Muslim unity was more important than ethnic identity.[^41] He was less interested in minor differences in Islamic jurisprudence between Sunni and Shia or among legal schools than in organizing a united Muslim response to Western colonial pressure.[^42]

Between March and October 1884, al-Afghani and Muhammad Abduh published Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa ("The Firmest Bond," a phrase taken from Quran 2:256) from Paris.[^43] Though only eighteen issues appeared before the journal ceased publication due to lack of funds, it became extraordinarily influential throughout the Muslim world.[^44] The newspaper's subsidized distribution enhanced its reach, with political articles championing the struggle against British imperialism in Muslim lands and theoretical articles offering an activist reinterpretation of Islamic ideas and calling for Muslim unity.[^45] Al-Urwah al-Wuthqa was the first major forum in which al-Afghani systematically articulated the concept of pan-Islam, and it contributed immensely to his fame and that of Abduh.[^46]

In 1881, al-Afghani published his polemical treatise Al-Radd 'ala al-dahriyyin ("Refutation of the Materialists"), which became one of his most widely read works.[^47] Written in Persian and translated into Arabic by Muhammad Abduh, the book attacked materialist philosophy and included one of the earliest Islamic arguments against Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species.[^48] Though ostensibly defending religion against atheistic materialism, the treatise's true target was Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan, the pro-British Indian Muslim reformer who had argued that science was more important than religion in the rise of civilizations.[^49] By attacking Ahmad Khan's ideas, al-Afghani sought to undermine his pro-British political influence among Indian Muslims.[^50]

Al-Afghani played a crucial role in the 1891 Iranian Tobacco Protest, one of the first successful mass movements against foreign economic concessions in the Middle East.[^51] When Shah Nasir al-Din granted a monopoly over Iranian tobacco production and sales to a British company, al-Afghani agitated against this concession as a betrayal of Iranian sovereignty.[^52] He had been preaching against the Shah from the Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine near Tehran for seven months before being arrested and expelled to Ottoman Iraq in 1891.[^53] At the request of expelled cleric Sayyid Ali Akbar, al-Afghani wrote to the leading religious authority, Mirza Shirazi, urging the mujtahids to "save and defend [the] country" from "this criminal who has offered the provinces of the land of Iran to auction amongst the Great Powers."[^54] His agitation was one of the "fountain-heads" that led to Grand Ayatollah Mirza Shirazi's widely obeyed fatwa prohibiting tobacco use in December 1891, which forced the Shah to cancel the concession.[^55]

Through his charismatic teaching, al-Afghani influenced an entire generation of Muslim intellectuals and reformers.[^56] Beyond Muhammad Abduh, his circle of students and followers spread his ideas across the Islamic world, adapting his pan-Islamic vision to local contexts from Egypt to India to Iran.[^57] The major leaders of the pan-Islamist movement formed a triad: al-Afghani (1838–1897), Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905), and Rashid Rida (1865–1935), who were active in anti-colonial efforts to confront European penetration of Muslim lands.[^58]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his enormous influence, al-Afghani remains one of the most controversial figures in modern Islamic history, with debates about his true beliefs, motivations, and methods continuing to the present day.[^59] The most fundamental controversy concerns his religious identity and authenticity. His deliberate concealment of his Persian Shiite origins in favor of presenting himself as an Afghan Sunni has raised questions about his honesty and the depth of his religious commitment.[^60] Some historians argue that this deception was pragmatic and necessary for his pan-Islamic mission, while others see it as evidence of a fundamentally cynical attitude toward religious identity.[^61]

More troubling are writings and testimonies suggesting that al-Afghani had a rather heterodox, even skeptical view of Islam itself.[^62] His 1883 "Answer to Renan," written in response to French philosopher Ernest Renan's criticism of Islam as intellectually backward, implied that revealed religion might be untrue but useful for controlling the masses—a statement that shocked many Muslims when it was widely discussed during the 1960s.[^63] Some translators omitted controversial portions of al-Afghani's response because they deemed what he said about Islam inappropriate and potentially blasphemous.[^64] These writings have led some scholars to portray him as "heterodox," intellectually inconsistent, or even "irreligious," suggesting he used religion instrumentally to achieve political aims rather than being a sincere believer.[^65]

Al-Afghani's scholarship also came under criticism. His arguments against Charles Darwin's theory of evolution in "Refutation of the Materialists" allegedly misrepresented and caricatured evolutionary biology, provoking criticism that he had not actually read Darwin's writings carefully.[^66] Ironically, al-Afghani's own views on evolution seemed to soften over time, and he later expressed ideas similar to those of Darwin.[^67] This intellectual flexibility—or inconsistency—has fueled debates about whether he was a serious thinker or primarily a propagandist willing to take whatever philosophical position served his political goals.[^68]

His political methods were often manipulative and sometimes violent. Al-Afghani cultivated relationships with multiple rulers simultaneously, secretly grooming each for the role of caliph who would unite the Muslim world, apparently assuming that world leaders acted independently of one another.[^69] This duplicitous policy backfired repeatedly, leading to his expulsion from multiple countries and ultimately costing him his freedom.[^70] Most notoriously, he was involved in his follower Mirza Reza Kermani's successful assassination of Shah Nasir al-Din in 1896.[^71] While visiting al-Afghani in Istanbul in 1895, Kermani and al-Afghani allegedly planned the assassination together.[^72] Al-Afghani "reserved his strongest hatred for the Shah," whom he accused of weakening Islam by granting concessions to Europeans and squandering state revenues.[^73] When Iranian officials demanded al-Afghani's extradition for his role in the assassination, Sultan Abdulhamid II refused, as the Ottoman ruler valued al-Afghani's pan-Islamic ideology.[^74] Kermani was executed in August 1897, shortly after al-Afghani's own death.[^75]

Al-Afghani's political philosophy itself contained troubling authoritarian elements. Although sometimes described as "liberal," he did not actually advocate constitutional government or democratic participation.[^76] Instead, he simply envisioned "the overthrow of individual rulers who were lax or subservient to foreigners, and their replacement by strong and patriotic men"—essentially advocating for enlightened despotism rather than popular sovereignty.[^77] This authoritarian streak in his thought has influenced some later Islamist movements that prioritize strong leadership over democratic processes.[^78]

## Personal Life

Remarkably little is known about al-Afghani's personal life, family relationships, or intimate affairs—a silence that stands in stark contrast to the extensive documentation of his public political activities.[^79] Very little is definitively known about his family or upbringing, and he appears to have left no personal correspondence that reveals his private thoughts or domestic arrangements.[^80] This absence of personal information has contributed to the aura of mystery that surrounded him during his life and continues to perplex historians.[^81]

The available evidence suggests that al-Afghani never married and had no children.[^82] This is particularly noteworthy given that he lived for nearly sixty years during an era when marriage and family were nearly universal among Muslim men of his social standing.[^83] The absence of any mention of a spouse or children in multiple biographical sources strongly indicates that he remained unmarried throughout his life, dedicating himself entirely to his political and intellectual pursuits across the Muslim world.[^84]

In 1865-66, he briefly stopped with his family in his hometown of Asadabad while traveling through Iran, indicating he maintained some connection to his relatives.[^85] However, beyond this passing reference, no specific information about parents, siblings, or other family members appears in the historical record.[^86]

When al-Afghani died of jaw cancer on March 9, 1897, in Istanbul, he died "in the arms of his Christian servant"—a poignant detail that suggests he had no family members present at his death.[^87] The fact that only a servant is mentioned at this intimate moment, with no reference to a spouse, children, or other close relatives, reinforces the impression that al-Afghani lived a solitary personal life despite his gregarious public persona and wide network of students and political associates.[^88]

Those who knew him described al-Afghani as extraordinarily charismatic, capable of attracting devoted followers through the force of his personality and eloquence.[^89] His ability to gather circles of young intellectuals around him wherever he traveled—in Afghanistan, Egypt, Paris, Istanbul—suggests he possessed remarkable interpersonal skills and the capacity to inspire loyalty.[^90] Yet this public charisma appears to have been channeled entirely into political and intellectual mentorship rather than into building a family or maintaining long-term personal relationships.[^91]

His peripatetic lifestyle—constantly traveling, being expelled from countries, and moving from one political intrigue to another—would have made family life nearly impossible.[^92] Whether his solitary personal life was a deliberate choice to avoid the encumbrances of family responsibilities or a consequence of his revolutionary lifestyle remains unknown.[^93] What is clear is that al-Afghani embodied the archetype of the rootless revolutionary intellectual, unbound by family ties and free to dedicate himself completely to his pan-Islamic political vision.[^94]

## Legacy

Jamal al-Din al-Afghani's impact on Islamic political thought and Muslim anti-colonial movements has been profound and enduring, even as his legacy remains deeply contested.[^95] He is universally recognized as the founding father of Islamic modernism, the intellectual movement that sought to reconcile Islamic tradition with modern science, philosophy, and political organization.[^96] Through his student Muhammad Abduh and subsequent generations of reformers, his ideas about the compatibility of Islam and reason, the necessity of ijtihad (independent reasoning) to address modern challenges, and the potential for Islamic societies to adopt beneficial aspects of Western civilization while maintaining their religious identity have shaped Muslim intellectual discourse for over a century.[^97]

His vision of pan-Islamism—the political unity of Muslims across ethnic and sectarian lines to resist Western imperialism—inspired multiple movements throughout the twentieth century and continues to resonate today.[^98] His untiring quest for Muslim solidarity directly influenced Egypt's nationalist movement, Iran's constitutional revolution of 1905-1911, and the later Islamic Revolution of 1979.[^99] Modern Islamist movements, from the Muslim Brotherhood to various iterations of political Islam, trace intellectual lineage to al-Afghani's fusion of Islamic identity with political activism and anti-imperialism.[^100]

Al-Afghani's legacy of practical, anti-imperialist political activism remains of great importance to the modern Islamic world.[^101] He demonstrated that Islamic scholars and intellectuals could engage directly in political struggle rather than merely offering quietist guidance, helping to create the model of the activist religious intellectual that has become central to contemporary Islamic political movements.[^102] His emphasis on Muslim solidarity against "the Christian and imperial West" and his modernist, pragmatic, anti-imperialist reinterpretation of Islam continue to make him popular in the Muslim world today.[^103]

However, his legacy is complicated by the authoritarian and sometimes violent methods he employed and advocated.[^104] His involvement in the assassination of Shah Nasir al-Din and his general willingness to use any means necessary to achieve his political ends have made him a problematic figure for those seeking to develop democratic and nonviolent approaches to Islamic reform.[^105] Some later extremist movements have cited his example to justify political violence in pursuit of pan-Islamic goals, though this represents a selective reading of his complex thought.[^106]

The ongoing scholarly debates about al-Afghani's true religious beliefs and motivations have also complicated his legacy.[^107] Reinterpretations suggesting he was heterodox or even irreligious have provoked angry reactions not only in Egypt but throughout the Arab and Muslim worlds, where he remains a revered figure.[^108] These controversies reflect deeper anxieties in contemporary Islam about the relationship between faith and politics, tradition and modernity—precisely the tensions that al-Afghani himself navigated and embodied.[^109]

His influence on the trajectory of modern Islamic thought is impossible to overstate.[^110] Whether viewed as a visionary reformer or a cynical manipulator, a sincere Muslim or a heterodox opportunist, a freedom fighter or a conspirator, al-Afghani fundamentally shaped how Muslims have understood their relationship to modernity, the West, and political power.[^111] His career as a thinker and activist had a deep impact on the Islamic world and continues to be a source of inspiration and controversy today.[^112]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers have celebrated al-Afghani as a pioneering intellectual who courageously confronted the existential challenges facing the Muslim world during its most vulnerable period.[^113] Historian Albert Hourani, in his influential work "Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age 1798–1939" (1962), portrayed al-Afghani as a crucial bridge between traditional Islamic learning and modern political consciousness, arguing that his synthesis enabled subsequent generations to engage with modernity without abandoning their Islamic identity.[^114]

Many Muslim intellectuals view al-Afghani as a hero of anti-colonial resistance who recognized earlier than most the threat that Western imperialism posed to Muslim societies and dedicated his life to organizing opposition.[^115] His advocacy for technological and scientific advancement within an Islamic framework offered a path forward that neither blindly rejected Western innovations nor required the abandonment of Islamic civilization.[^116] His emphasis on the rational foundations of Islam and his argument that true Islam was compatible with science and progress provided intellectual ammunition for reformers seeking to modernize Muslim societies without westernizing them entirely.[^117]

Supporters emphasize that his strategic concealment of his Shiite Persian origins was not dishonesty but rather a pragmatic recognition that sectarian divisions weakened Muslim resistance to colonialism.[^118] By presenting himself as Afghan and transcending sectarian boundaries, he embodied the very pan-Islamic unity he preached.[^119] His use of Freemasonry, relationships with multiple rulers, and even involvement in revolutionary activities demonstrated his commitment to using whatever means available to achieve Muslim independence and dignity.[^120]

Contemporary Islamist movements often invoke al-Afghani as a founding figure who demonstrated that Islamic identity could be the basis for effective political mobilization and resistance to oppression.[^121] His legacy of combining religious authenticity with political pragmatism continues to inspire activists seeking to assert Islamic values in the modern world while adapting to contemporary circumstances.[^122] His influence on Muhammad Abduh, who became the grand mufti of Egypt and the leading Islamic reformer of his generation, demonstrates the productive potential of his thought when channeled through more systematic and less conspiratorial methods.[^123]

### Negative Views

Critics have challenged nearly every aspect of al-Afghani's reputation, questioning his intellectual honesty, religious sincerity, and political ethics.[^124] Elie Kedourie, in his controversial work "Afghani and 'Abduh: An Essay on Religious Unbelief and Political Activism in Modern Islam" (1966), argued that al-Afghani was essentially an irreligious manipulator who cynically used Islam as a tool for political mobilization while privately holding heterodox or even atheistic views.[^125] Kedourie's interpretation, based partly on al-Afghani's "Answer to Renan" and other writings suggesting skepticism about revealed religion, portrays him as a nihilistic conspirator rather than a sincere reformer.[^126]

Scholars have criticized al-Afghani's intellectual rigor and consistency.[^127] His "Refutation of the Materialists" demonstrated superficial engagement with Darwin's ideas, misrepresenting evolutionary theory in ways that suggest he had not carefully read the works he was criticizing.[^128] His philosophical positions seemed to shift depending on his audience and political objectives, raising questions about whether he had genuine intellectual convictions or simply deployed whatever arguments served his immediate purposes.[^129] This intellectual opportunism, critics argue, undermined the quality and coherence of his contribution to Islamic thought.[^130]

His political methods have drawn harsh condemnation. The deliberate deception about his origins, his manipulation of multiple rulers simultaneously, and especially his involvement in the assassination of Shah Nasir al-Din reveal a willingness to employ unethical means that critics argue disqualifies him from being considered a moral leader or legitimate reformer.[^131] Some scholars argue that his authoritarian political vision—replacing "bad" rulers with "good" despots rather than advocating for constitutional limits on power or popular participation—contributed to the authoritarian tendencies in later Islamist movements.[^132]

Critics note that al-Afghani's pan-Islamism, while rhetorically appealing, proved entirely impractical and produced no lasting institutional achievements during his lifetime.[^133] His constant expulsions from countries, inability to maintain long-term relationships with patrons, and failure to build enduring organizations demonstrate that his conspiratorial approach was counterproductive.[^134] Rather than uniting Muslims, his activities often created suspicion and division, with rulers viewing him as a dangerous agitator rather than a constructive reformer.[^135]

Some scholars argue that al-Afghani's legacy has been more harmful than beneficial, providing intellectual cover for violent extremism and authoritarian Islamism.[^136] His elevation of political struggle over spiritual development and his willingness to use any means necessary have inspired movements that prioritize power over ethics and view violence as a legitimate tool for achieving Islamic goals.[^137] From this perspective, the reverence with which he is still regarded in many Muslim circles reflects nostalgia for a charismatic figure rather than serious engagement with the problematic dimensions of his thought and practice.[^138]
