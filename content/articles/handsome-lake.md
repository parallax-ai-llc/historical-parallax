## Summary

Handsome Lake (Ganioda'yo) was a Seneca prophet who founded the Longhouse Religion (Code of Handsome Lake), a revitalization movement among the Iroquois/Haudenosaunee peoples. In 1799, he experienced visions that called for moral reform, the abandonment of alcohol, and the preservation of traditional ceremonies. His code blended Iroquois traditions with Quaker-influenced moral teachings. The Longhouse Religion continues to be practiced by thousands of Haudenosaunee people today.
