## Summary

Buffon was a French naturalist who wrote the 36-volume 'Histoire Naturelle,' one of the most comprehensive works on natural history ever written. He proposed that the Earth was much older than the Biblical account suggested (at least 75,000 years). He influenced later evolutionary thinking and was one of the first to question the fixity of species.
