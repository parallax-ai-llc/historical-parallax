## Summary

Shoko Asahara (born **Chizuo Matsumoto**) was the founder and leader of **Aum Shinrikyo** (Supreme Truth), a Japanese doomsday cult responsible for the **1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack**. Claiming to be a divine being who could transfer spiritual power to his followers, Asahara attracted some of Japan's brightest young scientists and engineers. Under his direction, the cult weaponized chemical and biological agents, including sarin, VX, and anthrax, in a bid to hasten an apocalypse he prophesied. He was executed by hanging in 2018.

## Early Life and Background

### Childhood and Disability
Born in Yatsushiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, Chizuo Matsumoto was the fourth son in a poor family of tatami mat makers. He was born with infantile glaucoma, resulting in total blindness in his left eye and partial blindness in his right. He attended a boarding school for the blind, where he reportedly bullied other students, using his limited sight to dominate those who were fully blind. He demanded money and favors from peers, foreshadowing his later exploitative behavior.

### Failed Ambitions
Matsumoto had high aspirations, reportedly telling classmates he would one day be Prime Minister of Japan. However, he failed the entrance exams for Tokyo University, Japan's most prestigious institution. He turned to studying acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine. In 1978, he married Tomoko Matsumoto. His early business venture, a pharmacy in Chiba, ended in disgrace in 1982 when he was arrested and fined for selling fake herbal cures (made of tangerine peels) as potent medicine. This failure bankrupted him and pushed him toward religious extremism.

## Rise to Power

### Founding Aum Shinrikyo
In 1984, Matsumoto started a yoga school called *Aum Shinsen-no-kai*. In 1987, he rebranded it as **Aum Shinrikyo** and adopted the name **Shoko Asahara**.
*   **Levitation Claims:** Asahara famously marketed a photo of himself appearing to levitate in mid-air (actually hopping in a lotus position). This "miracle" attracted young people interested in the occult and supernatural.
*   **Recruitment:** The cult targeted elite university students ("sheeple" disillusioned with Japan's corporate grind), promising them supernatural powers and spiritual salvation.

### Scientific Lieutenants
Asahara recruited highly educated scientists to build his arsenal:
*   **Hideo Murai:** An astrophysicist and the cult's "Science and Technology Minister." He led the chemical weapons program.
*   **Kiyohide Hayakawa:** The cult's "Construction Minister," responsible for acquiring Russian military hardware (including a Mil Mi-17 helicopter) and uranium for potential nuclear weapons.
*   **Seiichi Endo:** A genetic engineer who worked on the cult's biological weapons (anthrax and botulinum toxin).

## Ideology and Bizarre Practices

### Syncretic Doom
Asahara's teachings were a dangerous mix of Tibetan Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian millennialism, and the prophecies of Nostradamus. He taught that the United States would start World War III (Armageddon) in 1997, and only Aum members would survive to build a new society.

### "Poa" (Phowa)
Asahara twisted the Tibetan Buddhist concept of "phowa" (consciousness transfer at death) to justify murder. He taught that killing someone with bad karma (e.g., police, judges, defectors) was an act of mercy, as it prevented them from accumulating more bad karma, thus "saving" their soul.

### Initiation Rituals
Initiations were designed to break the recruit's will and extract money:
*   **Blood Initiation:** Members paid thousands of dollars to drink a vial of Asahara's blood (often mixed with grape juice).
*   **Bathwater:** Followers purchased and drank Asahara's dirty bathwater, believing it contained his "DNA" and spiritual energy.
*   **LSD and Drugs:** The cult manufactured LSD and methamphetamines, using them in rituals to induce "religious experiences" and ensure obedience.
*   **PSI (Perfect Salvation Initiation):** A headset worn by devotees that delivered electrical shocks to the head, supposedly to synchronize their brainwaves with Asahara's.

## Terrorist Activities

### The 1990 Election Failure
In 1990, Asahara and 24 followers ran for the Japanese Diet (parliament) under the "Truth Party." They campaigned in outlandish costumes, singing cult songs. They were soundly defeated, receiving very few votes. This public humiliation deeply embittered Asahara, leading him to declare war on society and accelerate his weapons program.

### Chemical and Biological Weapons
*   **Anthrax:** In 1993, the cult attempted to release anthrax spores from a rooftop in Tokyo. The attack failed because they used a harmless vaccine strain of the bacteria.
*   **VX Gas:** Aum synthesized VX nerve agent and used it to assassinate enemies on the street.
*   **Sarin Plant:** The cult built a massive chemical plant (Satian 7) capable of producing tons of sarin.

### Matsumoto Sarin Attack (1994)
On June 27, 1994, Aum released sarin gas in a residential neighborhood in Matsumoto to kill judges overseeing a lawsuit against the cult. Seven people were killed and over 500 injured. Police initially blamed an innocent local man, failing to suspect the cult.

### Tokyo Subway Sarin Attack (1995)
On March 20, 1995, five cult members boarded different subway lines converging on the government district. They carried plastic bags of liquid sarin wrapped in newspaper. At the peak of rush hour, they punctured the bags with umbrella tips and fled.
*   **Casualties:** 13 dead, over 5,500 injured.
*   **Impact:** The attack caused panic across Tokyo and exposed the helplessness of authorities against chemical terrorism.

## Downfall and Execution

### Arrest
Following the subway attack, police raided Aum's headquarters near Mount Fuji. They found torture chambers, chemical labs, and a hidden crude microwave weapon. In May 1995, Asahara was found hiding in a small, secret compartment inside a wall, lying on a stash of cash.

### Trial and Silence
During his eight-year trial, Asahara was often incoherent, mumbling or remaining silent. He never explained his motives or apologized. He was convicted of 13 crimes, including the murders of the Sakamoto family (a lawyer, his wife, and infant son) in 1989.

### Execution
Shoko Asahara was executed by hanging on July 6, 2018, along with six of his lieutenants (including Endo and Hayakawa). Six more members were executed later that month.
