## Summary

Marco Polo (c. 1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant, explorer, and writer who traveled extensively through Asia along the Silk Road from 1271 to 1295. His account of 24 years spent in the East—including 17 years serving Mongol ruler Kublai Khan—became one of the most influential travel books in history. *The Travels of Marco Polo* introduced Europeans to the wonders of China, India, and Southeast Asia, describing paper money, coal, the Grand Canal, and Kublai Khan's magnificent court. Though some scholars question the accuracy of his claims, Polo's book profoundly influenced European understanding of Asia and inspired later explorers, including Christopher Columbus.

Other historians argue:
- Chinese records rarely mentioned foreigners
