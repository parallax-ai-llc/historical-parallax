## Summary

Marco Polo (1254-1324) was a Venetian merchant and explorer who traveled extensively through Asia along the Silk Road (1271-1295), serving in the court of Mongol ruler Kublai Khan for 17 years. His book *The Travels of Marco Polo*, dictated while imprisoned in Genoa, introduced Europeans to Central Asian and Chinese cultures, geography, and goods, inspiring future explorers (including Columbus). Though some scholars question details of his account, Polo's descriptions of China's wealth, technology (paper money, coal), and customs significantly influenced European knowledge of the East and stimulated interest in Asian trade routes.
