## Summary

Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio on December 17, 1936, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, served as the 266th Pope of the Catholic Church and sovereign of Vatican City from March 13, 2013, until his death on April 21, 2025, at age 88.[^1] He made history as the first Jesuit pope, the first pope from the Americas, and the first from the Southern Hemisphere.[^2] His pontificate was marked by progressive reforms, emphasis on pastoral care over doctrinal rigidity, and outspoken advocacy for the poor, migrants, and environmental protection.[^3] Throughout his twelve-year papacy, Francis challenged traditional Catholic approaches while facing significant opposition from conservative factions within the Church.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born on December 17, 1936, in the Flores neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina, the eldest of five children born to Mario José Bergoglio and Regina María Sívori.[^5] His father, Mario, was an Italian immigrant accountant from Piedmont who fled Italy in 1929 to escape Benito Mussolini's fascist regime, while his mother Regina was a housewife born in Buenos Aires to a family of northern Italian origin.[^6] According to María Elena Bergoglio, the Pope's only surviving sibling, the family did not emigrate for economic reasons but rather political ones.[^7]

Bergoglio's early education took place at Wilfrid Barón de los Santos Ángeles, a school run by the Salesians of Don Bosco in Ramos Mejía, Buenos Aires Province, where he attended sixth grade.[^8] He graduated from a technical school as a chemical technician before beginning his religious formation.[^9] At age 21, during his second year of seminary in 1957, Bergoglio faced a serious health crisis when he suffered from a severe respiratory illness that required surgery to remove the upper right lobe of his lung due to three cysts and pleural effusion.[^10] This early health challenge would foreshadow respiratory issues that would persist throughout his life.

The young Bergoglio felt called to religious life and entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus on March 11, 1958, after recovering from his illness.[^11] He completed his humanities studies in Chile before returning to Argentina, where he obtained a degree in philosophy in 1963 at Saint Joseph College in San Miguel.[^12] From 1964 to 1966, he taught literature and psychology at educational institutions in Santa Fé and Buenos Aires, demonstrating his commitment to education and formation of young people.[^13] Between 1967 and 1970, he studied theology, also graduating from Saint Joseph College, building the intellectual foundation that would guide his future ministry.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was ordained a priest on December 13, 1969, by Bishop Ramón José Castellano, just four years before one of the most significant and controversial appointments of his early career.[^15] He completed his final stage of spiritual training as a Jesuit, known as tertianship, at Alcalá de Henares, Spain, and took his final vows as a Jesuit on April 22, 1973, including the fourth vow of special obedience to the pope regarding missionary assignments.[^16]

In July 1973, at the remarkably young age of 36 and only four years after his ordination, Bergoglio was appointed Provincial Superior of the Society of Jesus in Argentina, a position he would hold for six years until 1979.[^17] This appointment came during one of the most turbulent periods in Argentine history, coinciding with the country's military dictatorship and the "Dirty War," during which as many as 30,000 Argentines were kidnapped, tortured, murdered, or disappeared.[^18] His tenure as provincial superior would later become the subject of intense scrutiny and controversy regarding his actions—or inactions—during this dark chapter of Argentine history.

Bergoglio's episcopal career began on May 20, 1992, when he was named Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires and was consecrated on June 27, 1992, as titular bishop of Auca.[^19] His rise through the Church hierarchy accelerated when he was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Buenos Aires on June 3, 1997, and became metropolitan archbishop after Cardinal Antonio Quarracino's death on February 28, 1998.[^20] His leadership in Buenos Aires earned him recognition for his pastoral approach, particularly his work in the city's impoverished neighborhoods, which led some to call him the "shanty town priest."[^21]

Pope John Paul II elevated Bergoglio to cardinal on February 21, 2001, bringing him into the elite group of Church leaders who would eventually elect the next pope.[^22] Between 2005 and 2011, Bergoglio served as president of the Argentine Episcopal Conference, demonstrating his growing influence within the Latin American Church.[^23] When he turned 75 in December 2011, he submitted his resignation as archbishop of Buenos Aires to Pope Benedict XVI, as required by canon law, though he continued to serve until Benedict's historic resignation in February 2013.[^24]

The papal conclave held on March 12-13, 2013, following Benedict XVI's unprecedented resignation, elected Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio on the fifth ballot after two days of deliberation.[^25] When white smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel chimney on March 13, Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran announced "Habemus Papam" ("We have a pope"), and Bergoglio chose the name Francis, becoming the first pope to take this name in honor of St. Francis of Assisi.[^26] His election marked multiple historic firsts: the first Jesuit pope, the first from the Americas, the first from the Southern Hemisphere, and the first non-European elected in almost 1,300 years.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Pope Francis's papacy was characterized by ambitious reforms across multiple dimensions of Church governance, theology, and social engagement. His most significant achievements reflected his vision of a "Church which is poor and for the poor," announced just days after his election.[^28]

### Vatican Financial Reform

Francis was elected on a mandate for bureaucratic reform after centuries of waste and mismanagement had put the Vatican's financial health at risk.[^29] He imposed sweeping regulations to bring order, transparency, and modern accounting practices to Vatican finances, including competitive bidding procedures, caps on gifts, salary cuts for cardinals, and centralization of assets.[^30] He created a Secretariat for the Economy staffed mostly with lay experts and ordered the cleansing of the Vatican Bank, closing approximately 5,000 dormant accounts.[^31] These reforms represented the most comprehensive overhaul of Vatican finances in modern history.

### Roman Curia Reform

The pope sought to carry out a deep reform of the Roman Curia—the Church's central governing body—to strengthen both the proclamation of the Gospel and the responsiveness to local churches.[^32] In 2022, these efforts culminated in a new apostolic constitution that reorganized the Vatican's departments (dicasteries) and placed priority on evangelization.[^33] This constitutional reform fundamentally altered how the Catholic Church's central administration operated, shifting power dynamics that had existed for centuries.

### Environmental Leadership and Laudato Si'

One of Francis's most celebrated achievements was his 2015 papal encyclical *Laudato si'* ("Praise Be to You"), which addressed the climate crisis and championed environmental stewardship.[^34] The document proposed an "integral ecology" that acknowledged the interconnectedness of creation and linked environmental degradation to economic injustice.[^35] This groundbreaking encyclical established the Catholic Church as a major voice in global climate discussions and influenced environmental policy debates worldwide.

### Synod on Synodality

Francis launched an unprecedented three-year global process called the Synod on Synodality in October 2021, which has been described as the culmination of his papacy and potentially the most important event in the Church since the Second Vatican Council.[^36] The synod, which concluded in October 2024, significantly expanded the role of lay faithful in Church governance and, for the first time in Catholic history, allowed women to vote in a Synod of Bishops.[^37] In a departure from tradition, Francis adopted the final document directly as part of the ordinary Magisterium rather than writing a separate apostolic exhortation, stating: "[The final document] participates in the ordinary magisterium of the successor of Peter, and as such, I ask that it be accepted."[^38]

### Clergy Sexual Abuse Response

Francis took significant steps to address the clergy sexual abuse crisis that had devastated the Church's credibility. In 2019, he expelled former U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was found guilty of abusing minors, demonstrating a zero-tolerance stance.[^39] He established a commission for the protection of minors and convened an unprecedented Vatican summit in 2019 that brought together nearly 200 church leaders.[^40] Concrete measures followed, including removal of the pontifical secret over such crimes, mandatory reporting by clerics to their hierarchy, and creation of listening platforms in dioceses worldwide.[^41]

### Diplomatic Achievements

Francis worked extensively to restore diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba, with his efforts leading to a historic meeting between President Barack Obama and Cuban leader Raúl Castro in Panama in April 2015.[^42] This diplomatic breakthrough culminated in President Obama's visit to Cuba in March 2016, marking the normalization of ties between the two countries.[^43] In March 2021, Francis became the first pope to visit Iraq, meeting with the country's top Shiite Muslim cleric in a historic gesture of interfaith dialogue.[^44]

### Interfaith Relations

Francis prioritized interfaith dialogue throughout his pontificate, particularly with Islam and Judaism. His historic 2019 visit to the United Arab Emirates marked the first time a pope visited the Arabian Peninsula.[^45] During this visit, he co-signed the "Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together" with Sheikh Ahmad el-Tayeb, the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar mosque and university.[^46] He also met with Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill of Moscow in Cuba in 2016, signing a joint declaration in what was a landmark moment for Christian unity.[^47]

### LGBTQ+ Inclusion

In December 2023, the Vatican issued the doctrinal declaration *Fiducia supplicans* ("Supplicating Trust"), announcing that Francis had formally approved the blessing of same-sex couples, under the condition that such blessings not be administered during formal rituals or liturgies.[^48] This decision represented one of the most controversial yet significant shifts in the Church's pastoral approach to LGBTQ+ Catholics, though it drew fierce criticism from conservative bishops, particularly in Africa, where all episcopal conferences announced they would reject such blessings.[^49]

### Economic Justice Teachings

Francis became a powerful voice for economic justice, repeatedly criticizing "an economy of exclusion and inequality" and declaring that "such an economy kills."[^50] In his 2013 apostolic exhortation *Evangelii Gaudium* ("The Joy of the Gospel"), he criticized trickle-down economics and championed "the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the state" as necessary for income equality.[^51] His document used the word "love" 154 times, "joy" 109 times, "the poor" 91 times, demonstrating his priorities.[^52]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Pope Francis's progressive reforms and outspoken positions generated substantial controversy and opposition, particularly from conservative Catholics who viewed his papacy as a departure from tradition.

### Traditional Latin Mass Restrictions

In July 2021, Francis issued *Traditionis custodes*, reversing Pope Benedict XVI's decision to liberalize the Traditional Latin Mass and imposing new restrictions.[^53] This move drew sharp criticism from conservative prelates and lay faithful who valued the pre-Vatican II liturgy, with many viewing it as an attack on traditional Catholic worship.[^54] The decision became emblematic of the tension between Francis's vision for the Church and traditional elements within it.

### Amazon Synod and Pachamama Controversy

The 2019 Synod of Bishops on the Amazon sparked intense controversy over Indigenous spirituality, particularly regarding a statue identified as Pachamama, an Indigenous goddess of fertility, which was displayed during Vatican events.[^55] Conservative Catholics denounced what they saw as idolatry being introduced into Church spaces, while defenders argued it represented legitimate inculturation and respect for Indigenous traditions.[^56]

### Same-Sex Blessings and LGBTQ+ Controversies

The approval of blessings for same-sex couples became one of the most divisive decisions of Francis's papacy.[^57] African bishops conferences uniformly rejected the policy, highlighting deep cultural and theological divisions within the global Church.[^58] Additionally, Francis allegedly employed a highly offensive slur toward the LGBTQ+ community during a 2024 closed-door gathering with Italian bishops, contradicting his public statements of pastoral outreach while reiterating opposition to admitting gay individuals to the priesthood.[^59]

### Divorced and Remarried Catholics

Francis's 2016 apostolic exhortation *Amoris Laetitia* included ambiguous language about providing communion to remarried divorcees on a case-by-case basis, causing significant backlash.[^60] Four prominent conservative cardinals, including U.S. Cardinal Raymond Burke, penned five *dubia* (formal questions) to Francis questioning the validity of the document's teachings, which they felt undermined Church doctrine on the indissolubility of marriage.[^61]

### Clergy Sexual Abuse Response Criticisms

Despite his initiatives, Francis faced criticism for inconsistent application of abuse policies. He still had not mandated a "one strike and you're out" requirement globally.[^62] He was criticized for not meeting the authors of a major 2021 report into sexual abuse within the French Church and for urging caution in interpreting its claim that about 330,000 minors had been abused over 70 years.[^63] Survivors' advocates argued that his considerable talk had not translated into comprehensive action.

### Argentina's Dirty War Allegations

The most persistent and troubling controversy surrounding Francis concerned his role during Argentina's military dictatorship and "Dirty War" (1976-1983). The main allegation was that Bergoglio, as Jesuit provincial, either failed to protect or even facilitated the kidnapping of two Jesuit priests, Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jálics, who were taken by Navy officers in May 1976 and held under inhumane conditions allegedly because of their missionary work in slums.[^64] Francis called the allegations "slander" and insisted he worked behind the scenes to save the priests, stating, "I did what I felt I had to do to defend them. It was a very painful affair."[^65] He was questioned about his conduct "for four hours and 10 minutes" and claimed his innocence was established.[^66] While Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel stated Bergoglio was no accomplice of the dictatorship, historians note that the full truth may never be known.[^67]

### Economic and Political Views

Conservative American commentators accused Francis of espousing "pure Marxism" following his criticism of free-market economics and "trickle-down" economics in 2013.[^68] His acceptance of a crucifix shaped like a hammer and sickle from Bolivian President Evo Morales in 2015 and his meeting with Fidel Castro during a Cuba stopover fueled conservative suspicions about his political leanings.[^69]

### Women's Ordination

Despite calls for greater inclusion of women in Church leadership, Francis remained firmly opposed to women's ordination as priests, a position that infuriated many Catholic women.[^70] In late 2024, he appeared to reject the idea of women deacons, saying that "holy orders is reserved for men," disappointing those who had hoped for progress on this issue.[^71]

### Conservative Opposition and Internal Divisions

Francis faced unprecedented opposition from within the Church hierarchy. Cardinal Raymond Burke, who had been sidelined by Francis early in his pontificate, emerged as a vocal critic and was eventually cut off financially after questioning Francis's 2023 synod.[^72] Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the Vatican's former ambassador to the United States, became Francis's most vocal conservative critic, publishing a 2018 letter accusing Francis of covering up sexual abuse reports and asking him to resign.[^73] Viganò's positions became increasingly radical, criticizing the Second Vatican Council, condemning COVID-19 vaccines, and praising Vladimir Putin, eventually leading to his excommunication for schism in 2024.[^74] Critics accused Francis of "an overly laxist doctrinal vision and a certain authoritarianism in Church management."[^75]

## Personal Life

Pope Francis, as a celibate Catholic priest who took vows of chastity, did not have a wife or biological children, having committed to abstaining from marriage to fully dedicate himself to the service of the Church.[^76] His family background and relationships with his siblings and extended family remained important to him throughout his life.

Jorge Mario Bergoglio was the eldest of five children born to Mario José Bergoglio and Regina María Sívori.[^77] His siblings were Oscar Adrián, Marta Regina, Alberto Horacio, and María Elena, with María Elena being his only surviving sibling at the time of his death.[^78] His other siblings died over the preceding decades: Oscar in 1997, Marta in 2007, and Alberto in 2010.[^79] According to María Elena, Jorge called her regularly from Rome, and they stayed in touch through long, heartfelt conversations, maintaining close family bonds despite his papal responsibilities.[^80]

His extended family included nieces and nephews whom he followed closely. His niece, Cristina Bergoglio, worked as a painter based in Madrid, Spain.[^81] Francis spoke frequently with his sister and stayed current with the lives of his nephews; one founded a non-profit to help the poor in Buenos Aires, inspired by the Pope's message at World Youth Day in 2013, while another became a priest.[^82]

Throughout his life, Francis demonstrated a simple, austere personal style that set him apart from his predecessors. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, he was known as the "shanty town priest" for his work in impoverished neighborhoods.[^83] Upon becoming pope, he famously chose to live in the Vatican guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, rather than the traditional papal apartments, and he continued driving a modest car and eschewing many of the ceremonial trappings of the papacy.[^84] His choice of the name Francis, after St. Francis of Assisi, reflected his commitment to poverty, simplicity, and service to the marginalized.

Francis's personality was characterized by warmth, spontaneity, and a pastoral approach that emphasized mercy over rigid adherence to rules. He was known for making impromptu phone calls to ordinary Catholics who wrote to him, visiting prisons, washing the feet of prisoners and refugees during Holy Thursday services, and using accessible, colloquial language in his homilies and public addresses.[^85] His personal motto, "Miserando atque eligendo" ("By having mercy and by choosing him"), reflected his theological emphasis on God's mercy as the foundation of Christian life.

## Legacy

Pope Francis's death on April 21, 2025, at age 88, ended a twelve-year pontificate that fundamentally reshaped the Catholic Church's priorities, governance structures, and public witness.[^86] His legacy represents what scholars have called "a bridge between tradition and modernity, championing a faith that prioritizes compassion over condemnation."[^87]

Three major contributions stand out as integral and distinctive parts of Francis's legacy: a redefinition of the papal office, the globalization of Catholicism, and prioritizing pastoral care over doctrinal rigidity.[^88] Throughout his pontificate, Francis shifted the mark of a true Christian from doctrinal purity to living Catholic social teaching in the world, fundamentally changing how Catholics talked to one another and what issues they focused on.[^89] A church historian called Francis's Council of Cardinal Advisers "the most important step in the history of the church for the past 10 centuries," while others suggested his pontificate would be "the decisive moment in the history of the church in which the full force of the Second Vatican Council's reformist vision was finally realized."[^90]

Francis brought important social issues to the forefront of Catholic discourse, including climate change, LGBTQ+ and women's rights, poverty, and the continual violence of war.[^91] His 2015 encyclical *Laudato si'* proposed an "integral ecology" that acknowledged the interconnectedness of creation and established the Catholic Church as a major voice in global environmental discussions.[^92] He changed the style of being pope, attacked clericalism, empowered the laity, opened the church to conversation and debate, and changed the pastoral and public priorities of the institution.[^93]

However, Francis's legacy remains deeply contested. His pontificate became caught up in increasing politicization between the liberal and conservative wings of the Catholic Church, with both sides seeing him as doing too little and too much for the other.[^94] He softened the church's stance on divisive social issues, promoting pastoral care over doctrinal rigidity, which endeared him to progressive Catholics but drew fierce criticism from traditionalists.[^95] Some critics argued that Francis "was at heart a conservative" who had a habit of floating progressive ideas and then retreating when met with pushback from the right.[^96]

His economic teachings, which declared that "an economy of exclusion and inequality... kills," represented a fierce urgency for economic justice, with Francis having no qualms about denouncing grave economic injustices in the strongest, most prophetic terms.[^97] His call for "the legitimate redistribution of economic benefits by the state" and his critique of capitalism's excesses positioned the Church firmly on the side of the poor and marginalized.[^98]

The Synod on Synodality, with its expanded lay participation and structural reforms, represents perhaps Francis's most enduring institutional legacy, setting in motion a three-year implementation phase culminating in an ecclesial assembly in 2028.[^99] His approval of the synod's final document as part of the ordinary Magisterium ensured that future popes would inherit a Church structurally different from the one he had received.[^100]

Francis's legacy to the global Catholic Church included profound changes in governance, a renewed emphasis on mercy and inclusion, and an unequivocal call to serve the poor and protect creation. Whether future historians view him as a transformative reformer or a controversial figure who sowed division will depend largely on how the Church navigates the path he charted and whether his reforms endure or are reversed by his successors.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and progressive theologians celebrate Pope Francis as a transformative reformer who rescued the Catholic Church from institutional sclerosis and reconnected it with the modern world. Cardinal Michael Czerny emphasized the "coherent development" of Pope Francis's magisterium, from *Evangelii Gaudium* to the later encyclicals *Laudato si'* and *Fratelli Tutti*, arguing that his teachings represented a unified vision of integral human development.[^101] Progressive Catholics argue that Francis "lived up to his nickname as the 'Great Reformer' and left behind a progressive legacy that transformed the Catholic Church for its 1.4 billion followers, centered on one transformative shift: Francis changed how Catholics talked to one another and what issues they focused on."[^102]

Scholars emphasize Francis's engagement with the humanities and appreciation for history as one of his greatest achievements. A medieval history professor praised Francis as "a religious leader who embraces history and scholarship and encourages others to do the same."[^103] His emphasis on synodality—understood as "walking together"—represented a foundational pillar of his Petrine ministry that empowered local churches and gave voice to the laity in unprecedented ways.[^104] The expansion of lay participation in Church governance, including allowing women to vote in the synod for the first time in Catholic history, represented a historic breakthrough for those seeking greater inclusivity.[^105]

Defenders of his economic justice teachings note that Francis brought a "fierce urgency to economic justice discourse," positioning the Church as a prophetic voice against inequality and environmental degradation.[^106] His insistence that "every economic and political theory or action must set about providing each inhabitant of the planet with the minimum wherewithal to live in dignity and freedom" established clear moral parameters for economic systems.[^107] Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel defended Francis against allegations regarding the Dirty War, stating he was no accomplice of the dictatorship and could not be accused of such.[^108]

Theologian Massimo Faggioli described *Evangelii Gaudium* as "the manifesto of Francis" and a "Magna Carta for church reform," arguing that it provided the theological foundation for all his subsequent initiatives.[^109] Progressive Catholics appreciated his pastoral approach, which emphasized accompaniment of individuals in difficult situations rather than rigid enforcement of rules, seeing this as a more authentic expression of Gospel mercy.[^110]

### Negative Views

Conservative critics and traditional Catholics condemned Francis's pontificate as a dangerous departure from orthodoxy that sowed confusion and division within the Church. After twelve years of his papacy, critics noted that "not for centuries had a Pope aroused such explicit opposition within the episcopate itself."[^111] Cardinal Raymond Burke and other conservative prelates emerged as opposition leaders, with Burke arguing that Francis's reforms threatened the Church's doctrinal integrity and liturgical tradition.[^112]

Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò's 2018 letter accusing Francis of covering up sexual abuse represented the most extreme conservative critique, with Viganò demanding Francis's resignation and subsequently denouncing the Second Vatican Council itself.[^113] While Viganò's positions became increasingly radical, his initial criticisms resonated with conservatives who felt Francis was undermining Church teaching on marriage, sexuality, and other moral issues.[^114] Conservative Catholics particularly objected to *Amoris Laetitia*'s ambiguous language on communion for divorced and remarried Catholics, with four cardinals submitting formal *dubia* questioning its orthodoxy.[^115]

The decision to restrict the Traditional Latin Mass through *Traditionis custodes* was seen by traditionalists as an act of aggression against those who valued pre-Vatican II liturgy, with critics arguing that Francis preached mercy while showing none to traditional Catholics.[^116] The African bishops' universal rejection of same-sex blessings highlighted deep cultural and theological divisions, with critics arguing that Francis's Western progressivism ignored the moral sensibilities of the Global South.[^117]

Some critics from both left and right argued that Francis "was at heart a conservative" who engaged in symbolic gestures without fundamental change, floating progressive ideas only to retreat when facing conservative backlash.[^118] Abuse survivors and their advocates criticized Francis for failing to implement a global "one strike and you're out" policy for abusive clergy and for inconsistent application of accountability measures.[^119] His refusal to meet with authors of the French Church abuse report and his cautious response to its findings disappointed those expecting more decisive action.[^120]

Scholarly critics questioned whether Francis's reforms would endure, noting that "depending on one's theological perspective, [he] was either woefully deficient in understanding basic sociological facts or a master manipulator who used media to bypass ecclesial apparatus and speak directly to 'the people.'"[^121] This assessment suggested that his legacy remained deeply ambiguous and contested, with future popes potentially reversing his initiatives just as he had reversed Benedict XVI's liberalization of the Latin Mass.[^122]

Conservative Catholics accused Francis of "an overly laxist doctrinal vision and a certain authoritarianism in Church management," arguing that he promoted dialogue and collegiality while silencing critics and sidelining those who disagreed with his vision.[^123] The financial cutoff of Cardinal Burke and the excommunication of Archbishop Viganò were cited as examples of Francis's authoritarian approach to dissent, contradicting his rhetoric of openness and accompaniment.[^124]
