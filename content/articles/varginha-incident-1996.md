## Summary

The Varginha UFO incident (Incidente em Varginha) is often widely referred to as **"The Roswell of Brazil."** In January 1996, a series of extraordinary events unfolded in the city of Varginha, involving multiple witness sightings of unknown bipedal creatures, reports of a UFO crash, and a swift military intervention. 

Following a reported UFO crash nearby, three young women stumbled upon a strange, crouching creature in a vacant lot, describing it as having brown oily skin, a large head with three protuberances, and glowing red eyes.[^1] The incident escalated with reports of military cordons, the capture of one or more creatures, and the mysterious death of a military police officer who allegedly came into physical contact with the being. Despite the Brazilian military's explanation that the "creature" was a local homeless man known as "Mudinho" and the UFOs were routine exercises, the case remains one of the most compelling and detailed close encounter cases in ufology.[^2]

## The Events

### Preliminary Sightings (Mid-January 1996)
Before the famous creature sighting, residents in southern Minas Gerais reported unusual aerial activity.
*   **January 13, 1996:** Pilot Carlos de Souza reported seeing a cigar-shaped object issuing smoke and losing altitude, seemingly crashing near Varginha. He drove to the site but was reportedly turned away by a military blockade already in place.[^3]
*   **Animal Disturbances:** Farmers in the region reported their livestock panic-stricken, and some claimed unidentified animals died under mysterious circumstances at the local zoo.[^4]

### The Encounter (January 20, 1996)
Around 3:30 PM on January 20, three young women—sisters Liliane and Valquíria Silva (16 and 14) and their friend Kátia Andrade Xavier (22)—were walking home through a vacant lot in the Jardim Andere district.
*   **The Sighting:** They saw a strange creature crouching by a wall, about 20 feet away.
*   **The Description:** They described it as roughly 1.6 meters (5 feet) tall, with dark brown, oily/greasy skin, a triangular head with three horn-like ridges, and huge, red, vertical eyes. They said it seemed "wobbly" or weak.
*   **The Reaction:** Terrified and believing it to be the devil or a demon, the girls ran home. Their mother returned to the site but found only a strange smell of ammonia and flattened grass.[^5]

### Alleged Capture and Military Involvement
Throughout that day and the following days, Varginha was abuzz with reports of military trucks (Brazilian Army) and firefighters sweeping the area.
*   **The Capture:** Whistleblowers and anonymous sources claimed that the military police and firefighters captured one creature in the morning (prior to the girls' sighting) and another later that evening.
*   **The Hospital Transfer:** Witnesses reported seeing military conveyances rushing to the Humanitas Hospital and the Regional Hospital of Varginha. Staff were allegedly told to clear wings and sworn to secrecy.[^6]

### The Death of Marco Eli Chereze
One of the darkest chapters of the incident involves Corporal **Marco Eli Chereze**, a 23-year-old military police officer.
*   **The Conflict:** Chereze was reportedly involved in the physical capture of one of the creatures without protective gear.
*   **The Illness:** Within days, he fell ill with a mysterious infection. He developed a boil that grew rapidly, followed by fever and paralysis. He died on February 15, 1996.
*   **The Controversy:** Official records listed the cause of death as pneumonia/sepsis, but family members and researchers claim medical tests revealed toxic substances in his blood unknown to doctors, fueling the theory he was infected by an alien pathogen.[^7]

## Detailed Description of the "Varginha ET"

Based on the testimony of the three girls and other alleged witnesses, the creature is iconic in Brazilian pop culture:
*   **Height:** Approx. 1.2 to 1.6 meters (4-5 feet).
*   **Head:** Large, bald, with three distinct ridges or "horns."
*   **Eyes:** Very large, red, and potentially glowing; no pupils.
*   **Skin:** Dark brown, viscid/oily, and veiny.
*   **Body:** Thin, frail-looking limbs, long arms, and alleged "V-shaped" feet (two toes).
*   **Odor:** Distinctive smell of ammonia or sulfur.[^8]

## Official Explanations and Skepticism

### The "Mudinho" Theory
The Brazilian military's official inquiry (IPM) concluded that the sisters had actually seen **Luiz Antônio de Paula**, a local homeless man nicknamed "Mudinho" (The Little Mute).
*   **Explanation:** Mudinho was known to crouch in that area and had physical disabilities giving him a non-standard gait. Muddy and dirty from the rain, the terrified girls mistook him for a monster.
*   **Critique:** The girls and their families vehemently rejected this, stating they knew Mudinho well and he looked nothing like the creature with red eyes and oily skin.[^9]

### The "Dwarf Couple" Theory
Regarding reports of "creatures" being taken to the hospital, official sources claimed witnesses had seen an expectant couple with dwarfism entering the maternity ward, which was misinterpreted in the hysteria.[^10]

## Legacy

The Varginha incident holds a unique place in UFO history due to the high number of witnesses and the speed of the investigation.
*   **UFO Capital:** Varginha embraced its fame. The city now features a UFO-shaped water tower and bus stops. The "Varginha ET" is a city mascot.
*   **The "Brazilian Roswell":** Like Roswell, the core narrative involves a crash, a retrieval, a military cover-up, and a shift from "it happened" to "it was nothing" (weather balloon vs. Mudinho).
*   **Media Impact:** The case received massive coverage in Brazil (e.g., on *Fantástico*) and internationally (featured in *The Wall Street Journal*), cementing Brazil's reputation as a hotspot for UFO research.[^11]
