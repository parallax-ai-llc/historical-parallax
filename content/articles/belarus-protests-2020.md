## Summary

In August 2020, Belarus experienced the largest protests in its post-Soviet history. The trigger: a blatantly fraudulent election in which long-time dictator Alexander Lukashenko—"Europe's last dictator"—claimed 80% of the vote despite overwhelming evidence he had lost to opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. Hundreds of thousands of Belarusians, dressed in white and red (the pre-Soviet national colors), took to the streets demanding his resignation.[^1]

The opposition was remarkable for its symbols: women leading marches in white, workers striking from Soviet-era factories, and a population long thought passive finding its voice. Tsikhanouskaya, a former English teacher with no political experience who had entered the race after her blogger husband was imprisoned, became the face of democratic Belarus. Most observers believe she actually won the election.[^2]

Lukashenko's response was immediate brutality. In the first days alone, over 7,000 were arrested; security forces systematically tortured hundreds. More than 50,000 people have been detained since August 2020; over 1,200 remain political prisoners. Key opposition leaders are in prison or exile. With Russian backing, Lukashenko survived and intensified repression. Belarus now functions as a Russian satellite state. But the 2020 uprising revealed a society transformed—one that Lukashenko may control but cannot reclaim.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Lukashenko's Belarus

Alexander Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994:

- First freely elected president; quickly consolidated power
- Rigged subsequent elections (1996 constitution expanded powers)
- Maintained Soviet-style command economy
- Known for authoritarian control, lack of reforms
- Called "Europe's last dictator"

Unlike other post-Soviet autocrats, Lukashenko relied less on personal wealth accumulation than on KGB (retained Soviet name) control and Russian support.[^4]

### Pre-2020 Opposition

Previous challenges to Lukashenko largely failed:

- **2006:** Election protests ("Jeans Revolution") crushed
- **2010:** Post-election crackdown; hundreds arrested
- **2017:** Tax protests; rare but limited

The 2020 election was supposed to be another managed affair.[^5]

### COVID-19 Context

Lukashenko dismissed COVID-19 as "psychosis," recommending vodka and saunas. His mishandling of the pandemic—as Belarus saw significant mortality—angered citizens and contributed to mobilization.[^6]

## The 2020 Election

### Pre-Election Crackdowns

Lukashenko's main potential rivals were eliminated before the vote:

- **Siarhei Tsikhanouski:** Popular blogger; arrested in May 2020
- **Viktar Babaryka:** Banker; arrested in June 2020
- **Valery Tsepkalo:** Tech entrepreneur; fled before arrest

### Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya

When her husband was arrested, Tsikhanouskaya registered as a candidate:

- 37-year-old English teacher; no political background
- United with campaigns of Babaryka and Tsepkalo
- Campaigned as three women (with Maria Kalesnikava and Veranika Tsepkala)
- Drew massive crowds; genuine popular enthusiasm[^7]

### August 9, 2020: Election Day

Official results: Lukashenko 80.1%; Tsikhanouskaya 10.1%

**Reality:** Independent observers, exit polls, leaked local results showed Tsikhanouskaya winning—possibly 60-70% in some areas. Ballot stuffing documented; poll workers later testified to fraud.[^8]

---

## The Protests

### First Wave (August 9-12)

After polls closed:

- Spontaneous protests erupted in Minsk and cities
- Security forces used stun grenades, rubber bullets, tear gas
- Nearly 7,000 arrested in first three days
- At least two killed; systematic torture began immediately[^9]

### Mass Mobilization (August-September)

**August 16:** Up to 200,000+ marched in Minsk ("March for Freedom")—unprecedented

**Key features:**

- White-red-white flags (pre-Soviet symbols)
- Peaceful, family atmosphere
- Women's marches every Saturday
- Worker strikes at major factories (including iconic Minsk Tractor Works)

**Slogans:** "Go away!" (aimed at Lukashenko)[^10]

### Symbols and Tactics

- **White clothing:** Solidarity; symbolizing peaceful intent
- **Flower protests:** Women with flowers facing riot police
- **Neighborhood marches:** Decentralized demonstrations
- **Worker strikes:** Historic in Soviet-style economy
- **Telegram channels:** NEXTA coordinated protests with millions of subscribers[^11]

---

## The Crackdown

### Initial Brutality

In the first days post-election:

- Mass arrests (7,000+)
- Systematic torture: beatings, electric shocks, stress positions, sexual violence
- Detention centers overwhelmed
- Released detainees showed severe injuries
- International outcry[^12]

### Escalation

Despite initial shock, protests continued; regime intensified response:

- Mass trials
- Targeting of leaders
- Media crackdowns
- Forced exile of Tsikhanouskaya (to Lithuania)
- Arrest of Maria Kalesnikava (tore up her passport to prevent deportation)
- Raman Bandarenka killed after detention (November 2020)[^13]

### Long-Term Repression

Scale of political repression:

- **50,000+** detained for political reasons (since August 2020)
- **1,200+** political prisoners (as of 2024)
- **7,400+** politically motivated convictions
- Viasna (human rights center) leaders imprisoned
- Independent media destroyed
- Mass emigration[^14]

---

## Death Toll and Casualties

**Direct protest deaths:** At least 7-10 confirmed, including:

- Aliaksandr Taraikouski (shot August 10)
- Aliaksandr Vikhor (died after detention)
- Henadz Shutau (shot August 11)
- Raman Bandarenka (beaten, died November 12)

**Deaths in custody:** Multiple, including:

- Vitold Ashurak
- Mikalai Klimovich
- Ales Pushkin

**Injuries:** Hundreds documented with severe trauma from torture

**Torture:** 450+ documented cases (UN); likely far higher[^15]

### Opposition

| Name                     | Role                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya | Opposition leader; in exile (Lithuania) |

| Viktar Babaryka          | Banker/candidate; imprisoned (14 years) |
| Siarhei Tsikhanouski     | Blogger; imprisoned (18 years)          |
| Ales Bialiatski          | Nobel Peace Prize laureate; imprisoned  |

### Regime

| Name                 | Role                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| Vladimir Putin       | Russian support crucial for survival |

---

## International Response

### Western

- EU, US, UK imposed sanctions on Lukashenko and officials
- Election not recognized as legitimate
- Support for Belarusian civil society
- Intensified after Ryanair forced landing (May 2021)

### Russia

- Putin backed Lukashenko; offered police assistance if needed
- Russian loans and political support
- Belarus became increasingly dependent[^16]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Historic Awakening:** 2020 revealed Belarusians wanted change—contradicting the myth of passive acceptance. The movement was genuinely popular, peaceful, and diverse: workers, women, youth, professionals. Lukashenko's "80%" was a fiction; the actual vote showed his illegitimacy.[^17]

**Structural Defeat:** Despite mass mobilization, the movement could not overcome a security apparatus willing to torture and a dictator backed by Russia. Without military defections or Russian neutrality, street protests proved insufficient.

### Regime Perspective

**Official Narrative:** Protests were a Western-backed "color revolution" attempt to destabilize Belarus. Security forces protected constitutional order. Lukashenko won legitimately.

### Critical Analysis

**Russia as Backstop:** Unlike Armenia (2018) or Ukraine (2014), Belarus had no path because Russia provided unconditional support. Lukashenko survived by becoming a Russian client.

**Diaspora and Future:** The Belarusian opposition in exile remains organized. Tsikhanouskaya maintains democratic credentials. The question is what happens when Lukashenko—or Putin—is no longer in power.[^18]

## Aftermath

### Belarus Today

- Intensified repression
- Complete integration with Russia (especially post-Ukraine invasion)
- Belarus used as staging ground for 2022 Russian attack
- Independent civil society destroyed
- Mass emigration (tens of thousands)

### Political Prisoners

- 1,200+ remain imprisoned
- High-profile leaders serving long sentences
- December 2025: Some releases in exchange for US sanctions relief[^19]

---

## Legacy

### For Belarus

- Revealed depth of discontent
- Created diaspora opposition infrastructure
- Demonstrated regime's brutality and dependence on Russia
- August 2020 now a reference point for Belarusian identity

### For Europe

- Showed limits of EU soft power
- Russia's willingness to prop up friendly dictators
- Migration crisis (regime weaponized migrants 2021)
- Belarus as co-belligerent in Ukraine war[^20]
