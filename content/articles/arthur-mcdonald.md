## Summary

Arthur McDonald is a Canadian astrophysicist who shared the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics with Takaaki Kajita for the discovery of neutrino oscillations. He led the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory experiment that solved the solar neutrino problem by showing that electron neutrinos from the sun transform into other types. His work proved that neutrinos have mass, requiring physics beyond the Standard Model.
