## Summary

Mahmud II was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, ruling from 1808 until his death in 1839.[^1] Often called the "Peter the Great of Turkey," he implemented extensive administrative, military, and fiscal reforms that fundamentally transformed Ottoman governance and society.[^2] His most dramatic act was the 1826 abolition of the centuries-old Janissary Corps in the violent "Auspicious Incident," clearing the path for comprehensive modernization.[^3] Though his reign witnessed significant territorial losses including Greek independence and defeats by Egyptian forces, his reforms established the foundation for the subsequent Tanzimat era of reform.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Mahmud II was born on July 20, 1785, in Constantinople (modern Istanbul), the son of Sultan Abdülhamid I and his seventh consort Nakşidil Kadın.[^5] He was the youngest son of his father and had an elder brother, Şehzade Seyfullah Murad, and a younger sister, Saliha Sultan, both of whom died in infancy.[^6] When his father died on April 7, 1789, Mahmud was not yet four years old, and according to Ottoman tradition, he was confined in the Kafes (cage), a secluded area of Topkapı Palace where potential heirs were kept isolated.[^7]

His cousin, Sultan Selim III, who had no children of his own, assumed responsibility for Mahmud's protection, upbringing, and instruction.[^8] Conforming to longstanding Ottoman customs for imperial heirs, Mahmud's training emphasized religious scholarship, mastery of classical languages including Arabic, Persian, and Ottoman Turkish, alongside studies in history, poetry, calligraphy, and rudimentary governance principles.[^9] The highly intelligent and energetic Mahmud escaped the debilitating weakness trapping other Ottoman princes through the exceptional instruction accorded him by Selim III between the latter's dethronement in May 1807 and his execution in July 1808.[^10]

This education proved invaluable when Mahmud faced mortal danger in 1808. During the conservative Janissary revolt that deposed Selim III, Mahmud's half-brother Mustafa IV ascended the throne and, fearing rival claimants, ordered the execution of both Selim III and Mahmud.[^11] While Selim was strangled to death while playing a reed flute and resisting futilely, Mahmud managed to hide, reportedly concealing himself in an empty furnace while his mother aided in protecting him.[^12] When Alemdar Mustafa Pasha arrived with armed forces intending to restore Selim III, he discovered the reformist sultan already dead and immediately proclaimed the surviving Mahmud as the new sultan on July 28, 1808.[^13]

---

## Rise to Power

Mahmud II's accession to the throne came through the dramatic July 1808 coup led by Alemdar Mustafa Pasha, the ayan (local notable) of Rusçuk (now Ruse, Bulgaria).[^14] Alemdar, a strong supporter of Selim III's reforms, had marched on Constantinople with approximately 15,000 men in an event known as the Alemdar Incident.[^15] Upon discovering Selim III's murder, Alemdar had no choice but to elevate the 23-year-old Mahmud to the sultanate, making him the sole surviving male member of the Ottoman dynasty at that critical moment.[^16]

The early years of Mahmud's reign were precarious. Alemdar Mustafa Pasha established himself as Grand Vizier and effectively ruled as a dictator with the Sultan as figurehead.[^17] However, before the year 1808 was out, conservative Janissaries revolted against the reforms, killing Alemdar and forcing Mahmud to delay his comprehensive reform program until he had consolidated sufficient power.[^18] This traumatic beginning taught Mahmud the necessity of careful preparation and absolute determination when confronting entrenched opposition.

A critical demographic crisis added urgency to Mahmud's position: no sons were born in the Ottoman dynasty until 1812, meaning Sultan Mahmud maintained his dangerous position as the only man in the imperial family for several years.[^19] This vulnerability made him acutely aware of the fragility of Ottoman succession and the need to secure the dynasty's future through successful governance and reform.

Between 1812 and 1820, Mahmud II gradually strengthened his position by eliminating most provincial warlords in the Balkans, Anatolia, and northern Syria.[^20] The Treaty of Bucharest signed with Russia in 1812 ensured that Wallachia, Moldavia, and Serbia remained under Ottoman sovereignty, providing temporary stability on the empire's northern frontier.[^21] Once the powerful regional notables (ayans) were eliminated or subdued, they were replaced by governors directly appointed from Istanbul, significantly tightening central government control over distant regions.[^22]

## Major Achievements

### The Auspicious Incident and Military Transformation

Mahmud II's most dramatic and consequential achievement was the forcible disbandment of the Janissary Corps on June 15, 1826, in what became known as the "Auspicious Incident" (Vaka-i Hayriye).[^23] By the 19th century, the Janissaries had ceased to function as an elite military force and had become a privileged hereditary class whose tax exemptions made them deeply unpopular with the general population.[^24] The number of Janissaries had grown from 20,000 in 1575 to 135,000 in 1826, with many not actually serving as soldiers but still collecting pay from the empire.[^25] Any sultan who attempted to diminish their status or power was immediately either killed or deposed.[^26]

When the Janissaries mounted a demonstration against Mahmud's proposed military reforms, he responded with overwhelming force, having their barracks fired upon with artillery.[^27] In the ensuing conflagration, approximately 4,000 Janissaries died in the burning barracks, while 6,000 or more were executed, exiled, or imprisoned in the aftermath.[^28] Mahmud also banned the Bektashi religious order closely associated with the Janissaries.[^29] This violent purge, though brutal, removed the major obstacle that had thwarted reform efforts for generations and created the political space for comprehensive modernization.

Following the destruction of the Janissaries, Mahmud established a modern Ottoman army named the Asakir-i Mansure-i Muhammediye (Victorious Soldiers of Muhammad).[^30] This European-style conscript army was recruited mainly from Turkish speakers from both Rumelia (the European territories) and Anatolia.[^31] The new force wore European-style uniforms and trained under European military systems, with officers studying in England and instructors imported from Prussia and other European powers.[^32] The training system was based on the French model, with teachers drawn from across Europe and parts of the curriculum taught in French.[^33]

### Administrative and Bureaucratic Reforms

Mahmud II made sweeping reforms to the bureaucracy to reestablish royal authority and increase administrative efficiency.[^34] He abolished old offices, introduced new lines of responsibility, and raised salaries in an attempt to end endemic bribery.[^35] Ministries based on European models were established with clear personnel policies defining hierarchies and ranks.[^36] In 1838, Mahmud established the Supreme Council of Judicial Ordinances, and the following year, he introduced a Council of Ministers to coordinate the running of the empire.[^37]

Among his most important administrative innovations, Mahmud adopted the cabinet system of government, provided for a census and land survey to reassess taxable properties, and inaugurated a postal service in 1834.[^38] In 1831, he established an official gazette, Takvim-i Vekayi (Calendar of Events), which was the first newspaper published in Ottoman Turkish and became required reading for all civil servants.[^39] He also established permanent European embassies, with the first in Paris in 1834, fundamentally changing Ottoman diplomatic practice.[^40]

Mahmud abolished the timar feudal system, bringing all land under state control and replacing provincial warlords with appointed governors accountable to Istanbul.[^41] The sheep tax was reformed by mandating payment in kind rather than cash, reducing opportunities for corruption.[^42] Military fiefs granted to cavalrymen were abolished in 1831, further centralizing financial and military authority.[^43]

### Educational and Cultural Reforms

Sultan Mahmud II declared an edict in 1824 emphasizing education's importance and making primary education compulsory throughout Ottoman territories, though implementation remained incomplete until 1839.[^44] He stated that the Janissaries needed to be replaced by a new army directed by reason and "by science," ordering the construction of several new military and medical schools to demonstrate this commitment.[^45]

Specifically, Mahmud established the Seraskerlik (equivalent to a modern Ministry of Defense) in 1826, the Imperial School of Medicine in 1827, and the Harbiye Military School in 1834.[^46] A new Military Academy was founded in 1834, providing cadets with European-style education.[^47] The medical school for army surgeons became operational in 1827, with instruction in French, representing a dramatic departure from traditional Ottoman educational practices.[^48]

### Naval Modernization

Following the devastating loss of the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino in 1827, where British, French, and Russian naval forces destroyed the combined Ottoman and Egyptian squadrons, Mahmud II gave top priority to rebuilding a strong Ottoman naval force.[^49] The first steamships of the Ottoman Navy were acquired in 1828, marking a significant technological advancement.[^50]

In 1829, the world's largest warship for many years, the massive ship of the line Mahmudiye, was built at the Imperial Arsenal on the Golden Horn in Constantinople.[^51] Measuring 76.15 meters by 21.22 meters, it mounted 128 cannons on three decks and carried 1,280 sailors.[^52] The United States agreed to provide technical support to the Ottoman Navy, sending experts who launched steamship construction activities at the Imperial Naval Arsenal.[^53] In 1831, Scottish-American shipbuilder Henry Eckford arrived in Constantinople with the goal of improving the technical infrastructure of the arsenal and educating Ottoman youth to become future naval engineers, emphasizing knowledge transfer rather than mere ship construction.[^54]

### Clothing and Symbolic Reforms

In 1827, Mahmud II mandated the use of the fez as a modern headdress for his new army, and in 1829, he issued new regulations requiring all civil and religious officials to wear the fez.[^55] The intention was to replace the turban, which acted as a marker of identity that divided rather than unified the population.[^56] The proclamation abolished elaborate codes dictating the style of turban to be worn by each class and replaced them with a simple directive: officials of every rank would wear the plain fez.[^57] The law applied to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, and in a state that had long institutionalized differentiation, Mahmud's new bureaucrats would be characterized by sameness rather than communal divisions.[^58]

Civilians also adopted European frock coats and capes, preferring trousers instead of robes and black leather boots instead of slippers.[^59] These clothing reforms symbolized the broader transformation of Ottoman society and governance, making visible the empire's commitment to modernization. Ironically, a century later in 1925, the fez itself was outlawed in Turkey as part of Atatürk's secularizing reforms.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Greek War of Independence

Mahmud II's reign witnessed one of the most damaging nationalist rebellions in Ottoman history: the Greek War of Independence beginning in 1821.[^61] The Greeks in the Morea (Peloponnese) rebelled, and Mahmud summoned Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt for military assistance.[^62] The conflict was marked by massacres on both sides, with Mahmud responding to Greek atrocities with brutal repression of his own.[^63]

In a particularly notorious act, Mahmud ordered the execution of the Orthodox Patriarch in Istanbul and authorized the massacre of civilians on the island of Chios, yet his armies continued to falter.[^64] Ottoman forces struggled to suppress the Greek revolt due to the weakness of the Ottoman navy, which had relied heavily on Greek sailors who now fought against their former masters.[^65] The failure to suppress the rebellion at its outset, especially the heavy defeat at the Morea campaign in 1822, prompted questioning of the legitimacy of Mahmud's rule by the Janissaries and wider populace.[^66]

The situation deteriorated further when the British, French, and Russian fleets intervened, destroying the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet at the Battle of Navarino on October 20, 1827.[^67] Following the subsequent Russo-Turkish War of 1828-29, in which Ottoman forces were decisively defeated, Mahmud was forced to acknowledge Greek independence in 1830.[^68] This humiliating loss demonstrated the empire's military weakness and emboldened other nationalist movements throughout the Balkans.

### The Egyptian Crisis and Military Defeats

Following the Ottoman-Egyptian collaboration against the Greek War of Independence, Muhammad Ali Pasha of Egypt sought substantial rewards for his military support.[^69] By 1830, he formally demanded the pashalik of Syria from Sultan Mahmud II as compensation, but the Sultan refused.[^70] This refusal led to the Egyptian-Ottoman War of 1831-1833, in which Mahmud's reformed but still inadequate military forces were comprehensively defeated.

The decisive Ottoman rout at the Battle of Konya on December 21, 1832, where Ibrahim Pasha's Egyptian army overwhelmed the Grand Vizier's troops with Ottoman losses exceeding 10,000, brought Egyptian forces within striking distance of Istanbul itself.[^71] This catastrophic defeat forced Mahmud to request Russian military intervention in February 1833, with Russia deploying 15,000 troops to the Bosphorus, underscoring the failure of incremental reforms to produce a viable defense.[^72] The Convention of Kütahya signed on May 4, 1833, granted Muhammad Ali hereditary rule over Egypt and nominal governorship of Syria, Adana, and Crete, a humiliating compromise.[^73]

Determined to take revenge, Mahmud sent his army against the Egyptians in Syria once more but was severely defeated at the Battle of Nizip on June 24, 1839, just days before his own death.[^74] These repeated military failures demonstrated that while Mahmud had eliminated obstacles to reform, he had not yet succeeded in creating military forces capable of defending the empire against determined adversaries.

### Religious Opposition and the "Infidel Sultan"

Mahmud's comprehensive westernization program provoked intense opposition from conservative Muslim subjects who viewed European-style reforms as un-Islamic innovations.[^75] Despite—or rather because of—his well-meant efforts at reform, Mahmud was hated by many of his Muslim subjects and stigmatized as an "infidel" and a traitor to Islam.[^76] His adoption of European dress, reliance on Christian European advisors, and perceived weakening of Islamic institutions generated deep resentment among traditional religious scholars and the general population.

The violent destruction of the Janissaries, an institution with centuries of tradition and religious sanction through the Bektashi order, was seen by many as sacrilege rather than necessary reform.[^77] Conservative critics argued that Mahmud was abandoning Islamic authenticity in a futile attempt to imitate European powers, and that the empire's military defeats proved divine displeasure with his policies.

### Territorial Losses and Nationalist Challenges

Mahmud's failure to deal decisively with nationalism and separatism demonstrated the primary challenge facing the Ottoman Empire during its declining years.[^78] Beyond Greek independence, his reign witnessed increasing autonomy for Serbia, with Serbian autonomy recognized in 1830 and extended over the full area of the Serbian state in 1833.[^79] The Treaty of Adrianople signed on September 14, 1829, after the Russo-Turkish War, granted Russia significant territorial gains along the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube, opened the Dardanelles to all commercial vessels, granted autonomy to Serbia, and promised autonomy for Greece.[^80] Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia until Turkey paid a large indemnity, and Turkey recognized Russian sovereignty over parts of present-day northwest Armenia.[^81]

By the time of Mahmud's death in 1839, the Ottoman Empire was significantly diminished in extent, having lost Greece entirely, effective control over Egypt and much of Syria, and facing autonomous provinces in the Balkans that would eventually achieve full independence.[^82] These losses occurred despite—or perhaps partly because of—Mahmud's reform efforts, as his elimination of the Janissaries temporarily weakened Ottoman military capabilities during a critical period.

## Personal Life

### Family and Marriages

Mahmud II had multiple consorts in his harem, reflecting traditional Ottoman imperial practices.[^83] His consorts included Hacıye Pertevpiyale Nevfidan Kadın, who was Mahmud's concubine when he was still a prince and became BaşKadin (First Consort) after the death of Alicenab, and was the mother of at least one son and four daughters.[^84] Other consorts included Hacıye Hoş-yâr Kadınefendi, Âşûb-i Cân Kadınefendi, Zer-nigâr Kadınefendi, Bezmialem (who later became Valide Sultan as mother of the next sultan), and Dilseza Kadın, who served as Second Kadın and was mother of at least two sons.[^85]

Mahmud had a large family, though unfortunately most of his children died in infancy.[^86] His most notable sons who survived to adulthood were Abdülmecid I and Abdülaziz, both of whom later became Sultans and continued his reform programs.[^87] He also had several daughters who survived to adulthood, including Saliha Sultan, Mihrimah Sultan, Atiye Sultan, and Adile Sultan.[^88]

### Personality and Character

Sultan Mahmud was characterized by extraordinary energy and an intellectual curiosity that led him to follow closely the reforms occurring in Europe.[^89] He was a master calligrapher, demonstrating the traditional Ottoman cultural accomplishments alongside his modernizing impulses.[^90] German military advisor Helmuth von Moltke recorded in his memoirs that "Sultan Mahmud's religious feelings were so strong the fact that a few days before his demise, he had himself carried to the Bayezid Mosque for Friday prayer in a half-dead situation proves this."[^91]

Mahmud was deeply religious, spending nights in various barracks mosques such as Eyüp, Davud Pasha, and Topçular Mosques engaged in dhikr (devotional remembrance), prayer, and religious conversations.[^92] He was a fellow of the Mevlevi Order (the whirling dervishes) under his uncle Sultan Selim III's influence, and later entered the Naqshbandi Sufi order.[^93] During his reign, emphasis was placed on his role as caliph, with Mahmud II proclaimed to be the caliph of all Muslims who sat on the throne of khilafat al-kubra, a phrase generally used only in connection with the first four political successors (caliphs) of the Prophet Muhammad.[^94]

Despite his personal Islamic piety, Mahmud demonstrated remarkable tolerance toward religious minorities. He famously stated: "I would like to get to know Muslims from my subjects only in the mosque, Christians in the church and Jews in the synagogue. There is no other difference between them at all. My love and justice are strong to all and they are all my true children."[^95] This statement reflected a vision of Ottoman citizenship transcending religious divisions, anticipating the later Tanzimat reforms that would formalize legal equality.

Sultan Mahmud II provided a valuable personal example of good sense and economy, organizing the imperial household, suppressing all titles without duties, and eliminating all salaried officials without actual functions.[^96] His personal discipline and commitment to efficient administration set the tone for the bureaucratic reforms he demanded of others.

## Legacy

### Foundation of the Tanzimat Era

Mahmud II's greatest achievement, in the words of historian Malcolm Yapp, "was to establish the respectability of change," demonstrating where previous sultans like Selim III had tried and failed that reform was both a positive and necessary force.[^97] The closing years of Mahmud's rule saw the beginning of the Tanzimat (meaning "reorganization") of the Ottoman Empire, and it was due to Mahmud's efforts that later sultans were able to continue the Tanzimat reforms.[^98]

His son Abdülmecid I, who succeeded him on July 2, 1839, at only sixteen years of age, announced the Tanzimat Edict (Gülhane Hatt-ı Hümayunu) upon his accession, beginning an era of comprehensive modernization that built directly on Mahmud's foundations.[^99] The Tanzimat reforms from 1839-1876 expanded Mahmud's policies, culminating in the empire's first constitution.[^100] The 1846 comprehensive plan for state education and the 1869 Regulation of Public Instruction that introduced an empire-wide school system producing bureaucrats and military officers equipped with modern skills were direct continuations of Mahmud's educational initiatives.[^101]

### Long-Term Impact on Turkey and the Modern Middle East

Mahmud II's reign represents a critical turning point in the Ottoman Empire's history, balancing tradition and reform to ensure its survival in an era of significant transformation.[^102] Though the Ottoman Empire ultimately collapsed after World War I, Mahmud's secularizing reforms directly influenced Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's creation of modern Turkey.[^103] The administrative structures, military organization, educational institutions, and conception of a centralized state bureaucracy that Atatürk inherited and adapted had their origins in Mahmud's reforms.

Those educated in the schools established during the Tanzimat period that emerged from Mahmud's foundations included major personalities of the nation-states that would develop from the Ottoman Empire.[^104] The new army Mahmud created became an instrument of political centralization and provided the major motive for continued modernization throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.[^105]

### Comparative Historical Significance

Mahmud II is frequently described as the "Peter the Great of Turkey" due to the comprehensiveness of his reforms and his willingness to employ violent means to overcome conservative opposition.[^106] Like Peter the Great's westernization of Russia, Mahmud's reforms fundamentally reoriented his empire toward European models while attempting to preserve its independence and core identity.

By dismantling medieval structures and cautiously embracing selective westernization, Mahmud proved that even declining empires could reinvent themselves, though the ultimate success of such efforts remained uncertain.[^107] His disbandment of the conservative Janissary Corps removed a major obstacle to reform, creating the foundations of the subsequent Tanzimat era that his successors would build upon.[^108]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern historians generally recognize Mahmud II as a transformative figure who undertook necessary, though painful, reforms in response to existential threats to the Ottoman Empire.[^109] Scholars praise his political courage in confronting the Janissaries, noting that numerous previous sultans had been deposed or killed for attempting lesser reforms.[^110] His success in destroying this entrenched interest group demonstrated decisive leadership and created political space for comprehensive modernization.

The administrative and bureaucratic reforms Mahmud instituted are viewed as essential steps toward creating a functional modern state apparatus.[^111] His establishment of ministries with clear hierarchies, merit-based advancement, the official gazette, and the Council of Ministers created structures that enabled more efficient governance and greater state capacity.[^112] These innovations allowed the Ottoman state to extract resources more effectively, implement policy more consistently, and respond more rapidly to challenges.

Educational historians credit Mahmud with initiating the transformation of Ottoman education from traditional religious schools to modern institutions capable of producing technically skilled administrators, officers, and professionals.[^113] The medical school, military academy, and emphasis on European languages and sciences created a new generation of Ottoman elites who would lead further reforms.

Mahmud's vision of religious tolerance and his statement about treating all subjects equally regardless of faith is seen as remarkably progressive for its time and prefiguring the later Tanzimat guarantees of legal equality.[^114] His personal example of Islamic piety combined with openness to European knowledge demonstrated that modernization need not require abandoning religious identity.

### Negative Views

Critics of Mahmud II emphasize the authoritarianism and violence of his methods, particularly the mass killings during the Auspicious Incident.[^115] While the destruction of the Janissaries may have been necessary, the execution or exile of thousands without trial violated principles of justice and created lasting resentment among conservative Muslims.[^116] Some historians argue that a more gradual, negotiated reform of the Janissaries might have been possible with greater patience and political skill.

The repeated military defeats during Mahmud's reign—the loss of Greece, the humiliation by Egyptian forces, the disastrous Russo-Turkish Wars—suggest that his reforms failed to achieve their primary objective of strengthening the empire militarily.[^117] Critics contend that the destruction of the Janissaries created a dangerous power vacuum at precisely the moment when the empire faced multiple external threats, and that Mahmud's new military forces proved inadequate in actual combat for many years.[^118]

Some scholars question whether Mahmud's westernizing reforms were appropriate for Ottoman society and whether they alienated the Muslim majority without delivering compensating benefits.[^119] The stigmatization of Mahmud as an "infidel sultan" by his own subjects indicates deep cultural resistance to European-style modernization.[^120] This cultural conflict arguably weakened Ottoman cohesion and contributed to the rise of Turkish nationalism and other identity movements that would eventually fragment the empire.

Economic historians note that despite Mahmud's reforms, the Ottoman Empire continued to lose economic ground to European powers and became increasingly dependent on European loans and economic intervention.[^121] The territorial losses during his reign—Greece, effective control over Egypt, autonomy for Serbia—represented not merely military defeats but also significant economic losses that weakened the empire's fiscal capacity.[^122]

Finally, critics argue that Mahmud's centralization efforts, while administratively rational, destroyed local power structures and traditional forms of governance without creating effective replacements, contributing to administrative chaos and provincial alienation.[^123] The elimination of ayans and derebeys removed leaders who had local knowledge and legitimacy, replacing them with appointed governors who often lacked both.[^124]
