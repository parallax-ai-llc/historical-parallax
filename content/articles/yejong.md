## Summary

Yejong (born February 12, 1450; died December 31, 1469) was the 8th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning for only 14 months (1468–1469). He was the second son of **King Sejo**. Physically frail but politically ambitious, Yejong attempted to strengthen royal power and curb the influence of the powerful Merit Subjects (Hungu faction) left behind by his father. However, his sudden death at the age of 19 cut his reforms short. His reign is most noted for the controversial **Nam I Rebellion**, a purge of a promising young general that many historians view as a frame-up by the conservative old guard.[^1]

## Short and Strict Reign

Yejong ascended the throne at age 18 after Sejo's abdication.
*   **Strict Rule:** Known for his strict adherence to law and order, arguably influenced by his father Sejo's iron-fisted rule. He personally inspected troops and tried to discipline the court reforms.[^2]
*   **Weak Health:** He suffered from severe foot gangrene (a complication often linked to the "curse" of Queen Soheon or genetic issues), which plagued him until his death.[^3]

## General Nam I's Rebellion (1468)

The defining event of his short reign was the execution of **General Nam I**.
*   **The Hero:** Nam I was a brilliant young general (late 20s) who had distinguished himself in suppressing the Yi Si-ae Rebellion and fighting the Jurchens. He was a favorite of King Sejo.
*   **The Purge:** After Sejo's death, the old Merit Subjects (like Yu Ja-gwang) felt threatened by Nam I. They accused him of composing a treasonous poem. Yejong, who reportedly disliked Nam I's arrogance, ordered his execution. This secured the power of the conservative faction for decades.[^4]
