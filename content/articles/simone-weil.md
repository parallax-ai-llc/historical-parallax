## Summary

Simone Weil was a French philosopher and mystic who, though deeply drawn to Christianity, never formally joined the Church. Her writings on suffering, justice, attention, and grace profoundly influenced theology and philosophy. She worked in factories and fought in the Spanish Civil War to understand the experience of the oppressed. She died at 34 from tuberculosis aggravated by her refusal to eat more than those in occupied France.
