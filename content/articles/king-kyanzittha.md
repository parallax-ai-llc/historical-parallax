## Summary

King Kyanzittha (1030-1113) was the third monarch of the Pagan Dynasty and one of Myanmar's greatest rulers, reigning from 1084 to 1113. Born as a minor prince, he rose to prominence as one of the legendary Four Paladins under King Anawrahta, endured multiple exiles due to forbidden love affairs, and ultimately saved the nascent Pagan Empire from collapse during a Mon rebellion. His 28-year reign transformed Pagan into a major Southeast Asian power recognized by China's Song Dynasty and India's Chola Dynasty, while his patronage of Buddhism and temple building—most notably the magnificent Ananda Temple—established a cultural synthesis of Burman, Mon, and Pyu traditions that defined Burmese civilization.[^1][^2][^3]

---

## Early Life and Background

Kyanzittha was born on July 21, 1030, according to Zata, the most reliable chronicle for dating Pagan and Ava kings, though historical sources disagree on exact dates.[^4] The circumstances of his birth were shrouded in controversy from the beginning. According to the chronicles, he was born to Princess Pyinsa Kalayani of Wethali and Anawrahta, then a senior prince at the court of King Sokkate. However, his parentage remains uncertain, with some chronicles speculating that his real father might have been Yazataman, the Pagan official who escorted Pyinsa Kalayani to Pagan, rather than Anawrahta himself.[^4][^5]

His birth name has been lost to history, adding to the mystery surrounding his origins. Before Kyanzittha's birth, Anawrahta banished his pregnant mother to the countryside after being led to believe she was not of royal blood. As a result, Kyanzittha grew up in relative obscurity, far from the centers of power and courtly intrigue that would later define his life.[^4][^5] This humble upbringing, though born of royal lineage, would paradoxically shape his future political acumen and his appreciation for the cultures and peoples outside the Burman elite.

Anawrahta eventually recalled his son, likely by his early teens, recognizing the young man's potential. At Anawrahta's court, Kyanzittha found himself in the shadow of his elder half-brother Saw Lu, serving as a minor prince and royal cadet in the Pagan army. Despite this secondary status, he quickly distinguished himself through martial prowess and strategic thinking. The young prince learned warfare, statecraft, and the complex dynamics of managing a multi-ethnic empire that included Burmans, Mons, and Pyu peoples.[^5][^6]

His early military training proved exceptional. Kyanzittha participated in all of Anawrahta's major military expeditions, including campaigns to the Nanzhao Kingdom in the north and the conquest of Thaton in 1057. These experiences exposed him to diverse cultures and Buddhist traditions, particularly the Mon culture of Lower Burma, which would profoundly influence his later reign. Much of Kyanzittha's early life remains shrouded in legend, with Burmese chronicles containing stories embellished with literary flourish that make it difficult to separate historical fact from mythological embellishment.[^5][^7]

---

## Rise to Power

Kyanzittha's ascent to power was neither straightforward nor inevitable—it was marked by extraordinary military achievements, romantic scandal, repeated exile, and ultimately, dramatic rescue missions that secured his legendary status. His rise began in earnest during the invasion of Thaton in 1057, where he gained fame as one of the Four Paladins, four legendary generals serving King Anawrahta who were each said to possess the combined might of an entire legion.[^8][^9]

The Four Paladins consisted of Kyanzittha (paragon of both physical and mental strength), Nga Htwe Yu (paragon of agility), Nga Lon Letpe (paragon of might), and Nyaung-U Hpi (paragon of stamina). Following the conquest of Thaton after a three-month siege, the Four Paladins were dispatched to take control of Tenasserim, where they defeated a Khmer army and incorporated the region into the Pagan Empire.[^8][^9] The mission to defend Pegu in the early 1070s became the most famous episode in their military careers, when warriors from Bagan easily repelled Yuan-Khmer raiders in just one day, to the amazement of the local population.[^9][^10]

However, Kyanzittha's military success was overshadowed by a romantic entanglement that would define the rest of his life. After successfully driving invaders from Pegu, he was assigned to escort Lady Manisanda, who was being brought as a gift to King Anawrahta. During the long journey, they fell deeply in love. When their affair was reported to Anawrahta, the king nearly killed Kyanzittha but instead banished his adopted son and best general for the rest of his reign.[^11][^12]

When Anawrahta died in 1077, his son Saw Lu reluctantly recalled Kyanzittha to Pagan at the urging of Shin Arahan, the primate of Pagan, to help administer the kingdom. Saw Lu had always viewed Kyanzittha as a rival, and his suspicions proved justified when Kyanzittha renewed his affair with Khin U (now titled Manisanda), who had become one of Saw Lu's queens. Kyanzittha was promptly exiled again, this time much farther away to Dala, in the region of modern-day Yangon.[^11][^12]

The crisis that brought Kyanzittha back came in 1082, when Saw Lu faced a serious rebellion led by his childhood friend Yamankan, whom he had appointed governor of Pegu. At a battle near Magwe in November 1082, Saw Lu was captured by the rebels. Ministers offered Kyanzittha the crown, but he refused, demonstrating remarkable loyalty by personally attempting to rescue Saw Lu through a daring nighttime raid on the enemy camp.[^11][^12] Despite his heroic efforts, Saw Lu was ultimately killed by the Mon rebellion in 1084, and Kyanzittha finally ascended to the Pagan throne after suppressing the rebellion. Upon becoming king, he married his beloved Manisanda, for whom he had twice endured exile, and made her his chief queen.[^12][^13]

## Major Achievements

Kyanzittha's 28-year reign from 1084 to 1113 transformed Pagan from a struggling kingdom into an internationally recognized power and major center of Buddhist civilization. His reign was characterized by three major areas of achievement: religious and cultural patronage, monumental temple construction, and diplomatic success that established Pagan as a regional superpower.

### Religious and Cultural Synthesis

During Kyanzittha's reign, the synthesis of Burman, Mon, Pyu, and Buddhist practices into a unified Burmese cultural tradition reached a level of maturity.[^1][^2] Having spent seven years in Mon country during his exiles, the king had genuine respect for Mon culture and maintained Mon scholars at his court. He pursued a conciliatory policy toward the Mon of the south, built Mon-style temples including Abeyadana and Nagayon, and used Mon language extensively in his epigraphs—likely because the Burmese script was still developing.[^14][^15] Mon language dominated the corpus of stone inscriptions during his reign and appeared in captions beneath Pagan's earliest wall art.[^14]

However, Kyanzittha's cultural vision extended beyond mere tolerance. He actively promoted the intermingling of Burmans and Mons, marrying his daughter Shwe Einthi to Prince Saw Yun, the son of the late King Saw Lu, and proclaiming their child rather than his own son as the legitimate successor.[^1][^16] This policy of integration helped heal the wounds from decades of conflict between the Burman and Mon kingdoms.

### Buddhist Patronage and International Relations

Guided by Shin Arahan, Kyanzittha continued Anawrahta's policies to reform Buddhism in Pagan and proselytized Theravada Buddhism throughout Southeast Asia.[^1][^2] His most extraordinary act of Buddhist devotion came around 1095, when he sent a mission to the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya in India—the site of Buddha's enlightenment—to carry out restorations. An inscription at Shwesandaw Pagoda in Prome records: "King Kyanzittha got together jewels of diverse kind and sent them in a ship with intent to build up the holy temple of the glorious Vajrasana… The great temple built by King Dhammasoka, which had fallen into utter ruin, His Majesty proceeded to build anew, making it finer than even before."[^17][^18]

This mission represented the first evidence of repairs to the Mahabodhi Temple by parties from outside India, reflecting Buddhism's gradual decline in the subcontinent and its ascendancy elsewhere in Asia.[^17][^18] Kyanzittha also sent a contingent to copy plans of the Mahabodhi Temple to build a similar structure in Pagan, demonstrating his commitment to establishing Pagan as a major center of Buddhist learning.[^18]

### Monumental Architecture

Kyanzittha's architectural legacy remains visible today in the temples of Bagan. He completed Anawrahta's Shwezigon Pagoda, which became the architectural prototype for stupas across Myanmar. Construction began under Anawrahta in 1059-1060 and was completed in 1102 under Kyanzittha.[^19][^20] The pagoda's graceful golden bell reaches 160 feet in height, supported on a square base with an octagonal intermediate base and three square terraces. It is believed to enshrine a bone and tooth of Gautama Buddha.[^19][^20]

However, Kyanzittha's crowning architectural achievement was the Ananda Temple, founded in 1091. According to legend, eight monks met Kyanzittha and described the Nandamula cave from which they came. Moved by their evocative description, he commissioned a grand temple in Bagan to replicate those caves.[^21][^22] The result was one of the largest and best-preserved Buddhist temples in Bagan, featuring a cruciform plan, four monumental standing Buddha images measuring approximately 9.5 meters tall, and a central spire rising about 52 meters.[^21][^22] The temple served to educate people in Theravada Buddhism's religious ethos while reflecting Kyanzittha's personal beliefs.[^22]

### Economic Prosperity and Political Stability

His reign was largely peaceful, allowing Pagan to grow wealthy from agriculture and trade. Large-scale temple building began in earnest, supported by this economic prosperity.[^1][^23] Pagan became an internationally recognized power, emerging as a major force alongside the Khmer Empire in Southeast Asia, and was recognized as a sovereign kingdom by China's Song Dynasty and India's Chola Dynasty.[^1][^2][^23] This international recognition facilitated trade and cultural exchange, further enriching the kingdom.

### The First Mention of "Myanmar"

A historically significant achievement occurred between December 1101 and April 1102, when the first recorded mention of the word "Myanmar"—the literary name of the Burmans—appeared in the epigraph of Kyanzittha's new palace.[^1][^24] This represents the earliest known written record of the term that would eventually give the nation its name.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite Kyanzittha's celebrated achievements, his reign and the historical accounts surrounding it have been subject to scholarly debate, questions of legitimacy, and moral ambiguities that complicate his legacy.

### Questions of Legitimacy and Paternity

The most fundamental controversy surrounding Kyanzittha concerns his very legitimacy as Anawrahta's son. Chronicles speculate that his real father might not have been Anawrahta but rather Yazataman, the Pagan official who guarded his mother during her journey to Pagan.[^4][^5] This uncertainty about his parentage raised questions about his right to the throne, particularly given the dynastic politics of the era. Whether this speculation had any basis in historical fact or was merely court gossip designed to undermine his legitimacy remains impossible to determine.

### The Manisanda Affairs and Political Instability

Kyanzittha's romantic entanglement with Manisanda, while portrayed in chronicles as a tale of passionate devotion, created significant political instability. His affair with her while she was intended for King Anawrahta led to his exile and removed the kingdom's best general from service during Anawrahta's later years.[^11][^12] When he renewed the affair after Saw Lu made Manisanda his queen, it further destabilized an already fragile succession, creating personal animosity between the king and his most capable military commander.[^11][^12]

Critics could argue that Kyanzittha placed personal desire above duty to the kingdom on multiple occasions. His actions contributed to the weakened state of Saw Lu's reign and potentially emboldened rebels who saw division within the royal family. The fact that he ultimately married Manisanda and made her chief queen after Saw Lu's death could be interpreted as profiting from the very instability his affairs had created.

### The Circumstances of His Accession

While chronicles portray Kyanzittha as heroically attempting to rescue Saw Lu from captivity, ultimately ascending to the throne only after suppressing the rebellion that killed the king, questions remain about the exact sequence of events.[^11][^12] Some historians have wondered whether Kyanzittha's rescue attempt was as sincere as portrayed or whether he calculated that Saw Lu's death would clear his path to the throne. The chronicles' claim that ministers offered him the crown immediately upon Saw Lu's capture, before the king's death, suggests that some at court may have been ready to abandon Saw Lu entirely.

### Historical Reliability and Fabrication

Modern scholars, particularly Michael Aung-Thwin, have questioned the reliability of many stories about Kyanzittha found in later chronicles. Aung-Thwin argues that key events in Burmese history had been invented or embellished by historians of the late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly Gordon H. Luce, who were "caught in their own intellectual and political world."[^25][^26] The chronicles give mostly fables with slight resemblance to original inscriptions, with the pre-reign narratives described as "fabulous, full of mistakes and contradictions, but still of value."[^7]

Kyanzittha's own inscriptions hardly ever allude to his pre-reign period and never once mention King Anawrahta (Aniruddha), whom he served.[^7] This conspicuous silence raises questions about what he chose not to record and why. Was he attempting to obscure controversial aspects of his rise to power, or did he simply see his pre-reign life as irrelevant to his royal identity?

### The Thaton Conquest Controversy

Historian Michael Aung-Thwin accepts Anawrahta's conquest of Lower Burma but argues that the chronicle narrative of the conquest of Thaton is a post-Pagan legend with little historical basis.[^7][^25] Since Kyanzittha played a major role in this campaign as one of the Four Paladins, questions about the historicity of the Thaton conquest cast doubt on one of the foundational military achievements attributed to him.

### Treatment of His Biological Son

While Kyanzittha is praised for promoting Burman-Mon unity by passing the throne to his grandson through his daughter's marriage to a Mon-connected prince, this decision effectively disinherited his biological son Yazakumar (also called Rajakumara).[^27][^28] Yazakumar, born to a wife during Kyanzittha's exile in the 1070s, made no claim to the throne. Whether this was due to his father's explicit wishes, political pressure, or personal choice remains unclear. Some historians suggest that Kyanzittha initially believed he had no son when he crowned the infant Sithu (later Alaungsithu), but the Myazedi Inscription of 1113 records a deathbed reconciliation between Kyanzittha and his estranged son, whom he had apparently disinherited through the peace-producing compromise of 1084.[^28][^29]

---

## Personal Life

Kyanzittha's personal life was marked by intense romantic passion, complex family relationships, and the challenges of managing multiple marriages and royal obligations. Unlike many monarchs whose personal lives remain obscure, Kyanzittha's romantic entanglements became central to the historical narrative of his reign.

### The Great Love: Manisanda

The defining relationship of Kyanzittha's life was undoubtedly his love affair with Manisanda, a woman for whom he endured two exiles and risked his political career multiple times. Lady Manisanda was originally intended as a gift to King Anawrahta, but during the journey from Pegu, she and Kyanzittha fell so deeply in love that their affair had to be reported to the king.[^11][^12] After Anawrahta's death and Kyanzittha's recall to Pagan, he renewed the affair even after she became one of Saw Lu's queens, resulting in his second and more distant exile to Dala.[^11][^12]

When Kyanzittha finally became king in 1084, he married Manisanda and made her his chief queen, fulfilling a love that had survived decades of separation, exile, and political obstacles.[^12][^13] Their relationship represents one of history's great royal romances, though it also demonstrates how personal passion could intersect with and complicate affairs of state.

### Multiple Queens and Consorts

Despite his enduring love for Manisanda, Kyanzittha maintained relationships with multiple women, as was customary for monarchs of the period. His chief queen consort was Apeyadana (also spelled Abeyadana), whose name means "Beloved Treasure."[^30][^31] She married Kyanzittha when he was just a young officer in the army, before his coronation, and according to some sources, she was an Indian princess from the Comilla region of present-day Bangladesh.[^30][^31] Apeyadana was the mother of Shwe Einthi, Kyanzittha's favorite daughter, whose son would become King Alaungsithu.[^30][^31]

According to chronicles, Apeyadana was of Mahayana Buddhist faith, highlighting the religious diversity within the royal household.[^31] After Kyanzittha became king, his personal life grew more complex. Apeyadana was succeeded as chief queen by Thanbula, and he also married other queens including Khin Tan, daughter of a feudal chieftain, and Thanbula, a commoner whom he met during his exile in the Sagaing region.[^31] The Apeyadana Temple in Bagan, built around 1102-1103, was named in her honor.[^30][^31]

### Children and Succession

Kyanzittha's children and the question of succession reveal much about his character and political calculations. His daughter Shwe Einthi, born to Queen Apeyadana, was his only daughter and became a central figure in ensuring dynastic continuity.[^27][^28] Kyanzittha forbade her from marrying a foreign prince, instead arranging her marriage to Prince Saw Yun, son of the late King Saw Lu.[^28] This union served multiple political purposes: it reconciled the families that had been at odds during Saw Lu's reign, promoted Burman-Mon unity, and legitimized the succession through a connection to the previous king.

Shwe Einthi had children with Saw Yun, including Alaung Sotho (later known as Alaungsithu), who succeeded Kyanzittha.[^28] The king was so delighted at the birth of Sithu that he crowned the infant as king, apparently believing at the time that he had no son of his own.[^28] However, Kyanzittha did have a biological son named Yazakumar (also called Rajakumara) by a wife during one of his exiles in the 1070s.[^27][^28] Yazakumar inscribed the famous Myazedi Inscription in 1113, and the text records a deathbed reconciliation between father and son, though Yazakumar made no claim to the throne.[^27][^28][^29]

### Personality and Character

The chronicles and inscriptions provide glimpses of Kyanzittha's personality. The name "Kyanzittha" itself was a title given by Anawrahta, meaning "the remaining/last standing soldier," reflecting his reputation for surviving in battle.[^32] This martial prowess was balanced by genuine intellectual curiosity and cultural appreciation. His years in Mon territory during exile fostered a deep respect for Mon culture that went beyond political calculation to become a defining feature of his reign.[^14][^15]

Kyanzittha demonstrated remarkable loyalty even to those who had wronged him, most notably in his attempt to rescue Saw Lu despite their troubled relationship.[^11][^12] Yet he also showed steely determination in pursuing his personal desires, regardless of social conventions or political consequences. His refusal to immediately accept the throne when offered, insisting on attempting to rescue Saw Lu, suggests either genuine nobility of character or sophisticated political calculation—or perhaps both.[^11][^12]

## Legacy

King Kyanzittha's death in either 1112 or 1113, at age 82 or 83, marked the end of an era that fundamentally shaped Burmese civilization.[^33][^34] His legacy extends far beyond his military victories and architectural achievements to encompass lasting transformations in culture, religion, language, and political identity that continue to influence Myanmar to this day.

### Cultural Synthesis and National Identity

Perhaps Kyanzittha's most enduring legacy was the cultural synthesis he fostered. His reign is generally understood as the time when the assimilation of various cultural traditions—Mon, Pyu, and Burman—began to meld into a common Burmese cultural tradition that would come to dominate the Irrawaddy valley.[^14][^15] This synthesis was not imposed through force but cultivated through patronage, intermarriage, and genuine respect for diverse traditions. The multilingual nature of his kingdom, reflected in inscriptions using Pali, Pyu, Mon, and Burmese, represented a cosmopolitan vision rare in medieval states.[^14][^35]

The first recorded use of the word "Myanmar" in his palace inscription of 1101-1102 represents a milestone in national identity formation.[^1][^24] While the full emergence of Burmese national consciousness would take centuries, Kyanzittha's reign marked a crucial transition from separate ethnic kingdoms toward a more unified political and cultural identity.

### Architectural and Religious Heritage

The temples Kyanzittha built continue to define Bagan's landscape and serve as active sites of worship over nine centuries later. The Ananda Temple remains one of Myanmar's most revered religious sites and a masterpiece of religious architecture that successfully blends Mon architectural traditions with Burman religious devotion.[^21][^22] The Shwezigon Pagoda established the prototype for Burmese stupas that would be replicated throughout the country for centuries.[^19][^20]

Beyond individual monuments, Kyanzittha's reign established temple-building as a defining feature of Burmese Buddhist kingship. It was under him that Bagan became known as the "city of four million pagodas," a tradition of royal temple patronage that subsequent monarchs would emulate.[^19] His mission to restore the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodhgaya established a precedent for Myanmar's ongoing engagement with international Buddhism and positioned the kingdom as a major Buddhist civilization rather than merely a regional power.[^17][^18]

### The Myazedi Inscription and Linguistic Legacy

The Myazedi Inscription of 1113, inscribed by his son Prince Rajakumara shortly before or after Kyanzittha's death, represents a remarkable linguistic and historical artifact.[^29][^35] Written in four languages—Pali, Pyu, Mon, and Burmese—it served as a Rosetta Stone that allowed scholars to decipher the previously unknown Pyu language.[^29][^35] The inscription's existence demonstrates the multilingual sophistication of Kyanzittha's court and provides invaluable evidence for understanding the linguistic landscape of early medieval Burma.

Significantly, the Myazedi inscription represents the last substantial use of the Pyu language, suggesting that during and after Kyanzittha's reign, Pyu culture was being absorbed into the broader Burmese synthesis.[^14][^35] The gradual decline in formal use of Pali and Mon, and the rise of Burmese as a mature literary language, reflects linguistic shifts that Kyanzittha's policies both reflected and accelerated.[^35]

### Political and Dynastic Legacy

Kyanzittha's grandson Alaungsithu faced no opposition to the throne when Kyanzittha died in 1112, ensuring a smooth transition that testified to the political stability Kyanzittha had established.[^33][^34] Alaungsithu would reign for 53 years, continuing his grandfather's policies and building traditions. The dynasty Kyanzittha saved from collapse during the 1084 rebellion would continue until 1287, when Mongol invasions ended the Pagan Kingdom's independence.

His model of kingship—combining military prowess with Buddhist piety, cultural patronage with political pragmatism, and personal charisma with institutional building—established a template for Burmese monarchy that persisted for centuries. Later Burmese kings measured themselves against the standard Kyanzittha set, particularly in temple building and Buddhist patronage.

### International Standing

Kyanzittha elevated Pagan to international recognition, establishing diplomatic and commercial relations with China's Song Dynasty and India's Chola Dynasty.[^1][^2][^23] This international standing facilitated trade, cultural exchange, and recognition of Pagan as a major Southeast Asian power alongside the Khmer Empire. The mission to Bodhgaya connected Myanmar to broader Buddhist networks extending from Sri Lanka to China, positioning the kingdom as a significant player in trans-Asian Buddhist civilization.

His cultivation of relations with the Chola dynasty through commercial ties and religious patronage demonstrated sophisticated diplomacy. Studies of Chola inscriptions reveal that in 1090, Kulottunga I renewed an endowment to a Buddhist monastery in Nagapattinam, reflecting friendly commercial ties expressed through religious patronage, and Kulottunga sought to cultivate diplomatic and marital ties with Bagan, recognizing it as an important stopping point for Tamil shipping.[^36]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern and historical scholars have consistently ranked Kyanzittha among Myanmar's greatest monarchs, with assessments emphasizing his role in establishing Burmese civilization's cultural foundations and his political achievements in stabilizing and expanding the Pagan Empire.

Kyanzittha is regarded as one of the greatest Burmese monarchs for saving the nascent Pagan Empire during the crisis of 1084 and making it stronger through wise governance and cultural patronage.[^1][^2][^23] His continuation of Anawrahta's social, economic, and religious policies transformed Pagan from a regional kingdom into a major regional power recognized internationally. Scholars particularly praise his cultural synthesis: the blending of Burman, Mon, and Pyu traditions into a unified Burmese cultural identity represents a rare example of successful multicultural integration in medieval Southeast Asia.[^1][^14][^15]

Gordon H. Luce, the pioneering scholar of Burmese history, extensively studied Kyanzittha's reign in works such as "The Career of Htilaing Min (Kyanzittha)" published in 1966.[^25][^37] Luce argued that under Kyanzittha and his successors, Singhalese Theravada Buddhism based on the Mahavihara canon became dominant in Burma, representing a crucial religious transformation that would define the region's spiritual character for centuries.[^37] Luce's meticulous work deciphering Old Burmese, Mon, and Pyu inscriptions revealed the sophistication of Kyanzittha's administration and his patronage of multiple linguistic traditions.

Contemporary Buddhist scholars praise Kyanzittha's genuine religious devotion, particularly his extraordinary mission to restore the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodhgaya. This act demonstrated that his Buddhist patronage extended beyond political utility to encompass sincere faith and commitment to preserving Buddhism's sacred sites.[^17][^18] His support for Buddhist learning transformed Pagan into a major center of Theravada scholarship, attracting monks and texts from Sri Lanka and contributing to the religion's preservation during its decline in India.

Architectural historians celebrate Kyanzittha's temple building as representing a golden age of Burmese religious architecture. The Ananda Temple in particular is recognized as a masterpiece that successfully synthesizes Mon architectural traditions with innovative design elements, creating a uniquely Burmese style.[^21][^22] The fact that these structures have survived over 900 years and continue to function as active religious sites testifies to both their construction quality and their enduring religious significance.

Scholars of Southeast Asian history emphasize Kyanzittha's successful navigation of regional power dynamics, establishing Pagan as a major power alongside the Khmer Empire while maintaining peaceful relations and fostering profitable trade.[^1][^2] His diplomatic recognition by both China's Song Dynasty and India's Chola Dynasty placed Myanmar within broader Asian political and economic networks, facilitating cultural exchange that enriched Burmese civilization.

### Negative Views

While Kyanzittha's reign is generally celebrated, modern scholarly reassessment has raised important critiques regarding both the historical king and the narratives surrounding him. The most significant criticism comes from historian Michael Aung-Thwin, who challenges much of the orthodox historiography established by colonial-era scholars.

Aung-Thwin argues that key events in Burmese history had been invented or embellished by historians of the late 19th and 20th centuries, particularly Gordon H. Luce, who were "caught in their own intellectual and political world."[^25][^26] He contends that much of our understanding of Kyanzittha comes from chronicles written centuries after the events, which give "mostly fables with slight resemblance to original inscriptions."[^7][^25] According to Aung-Thwin, narratives about Kyanzittha's pre-reign period are "fabulous, full of mistakes and contradictions," making it difficult to separate historical fact from literary embellishment.[^7]

The controversy surrounding the Thaton conquest—in which Kyanzittha played a prominent role as one of the Four Paladins—exemplifies these historiographical debates. Aung-Thwin accepts Anawrahta's conquest of Lower Burma but argues that the chronicle narrative of Thaton's conquest is a post-Pagan legend with limited historical basis.[^7][^25] If true, this would undermine one of the foundational military achievements attributed to Kyanzittha and call into question the historical accuracy of the Four Paladins narrative.

Some historians note the problematic aspects of Kyanzittha's personal conduct, particularly his repeated affairs that created political instability. His relationship with Manisanda, while romanticized in chronicles, resulted in the exile of the kingdom's best general during critical periods and created personal animosity between Kyanzittha and King Saw Lu that weakened the monarchy.[^11][^12] Critics could argue that Kyanzittha prioritized personal desire over duty to the kingdom, and that the political instability his actions created may have contributed to the conditions that led to Saw Lu's capture and death.

The circumstances surrounding Kyanzittha's accession remain somewhat murky. While he is credited with attempting to rescue Saw Lu, some scholars have questioned whether his efforts were as sincere as portrayed or whether he recognized that Saw Lu's death would clear his path to the throne. The fact that ministers offered him the crown immediately upon Saw Lu's capture, before the king's death, suggests that some at court were prepared to abandon Saw Lu entirely, raising questions about the political dynamics at play.[^11][^12]

Kyanzittha's treatment of his biological son Yazakumar, effectively disinherited through the succession arrangement favoring his grandson, represents another morally complex aspect of his reign. The Myazedi Inscription records a deathbed reconciliation between father and son, suggesting years of estrangement resulting from Kyanzittha's succession decisions.[^28][^29] While his choice to pass the throne to his daughter's son promoted Burman-Mon unity and political stability, it came at the personal cost of his relationship with his biological son.

Finally, the conspicuous silence in Kyanzittha's own inscriptions about his pre-reign period and his failure to even mention King Anawrahta, whom he served for decades, raises questions about what he chose not to record and why.[^7] This selective memory suggests a calculated approach to historical narrative that obscures potentially controversial aspects of his rise to power.

However, Aung-Thwin himself acknowledges the pioneering scholars' achievements: "Not that the pioneers of Burma's history were shallow, careless, ill-trained, or slipshod. On the contrary, they were the first to identify, collect, decipher, and read Old Burmese, Mon, and Pyu inscriptions, careful to a fault, and obsessively thorough."[^25][^26] This balanced assessment suggests that while specific narratives may be questioned, the fundamental achievements of Kyanzittha's reign remain historically solid.
