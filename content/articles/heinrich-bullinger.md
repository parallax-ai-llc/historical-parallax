## Summary

Heinrich Bullinger was a Swiss Reformer who succeeded Huldrych Zwingli as head of the Zurich church for 44 years. He wrote the Second Helvetic Confession, one of the most widely adopted Reformed confessions. He corresponded with leaders across Europe, including English reformers, shaping the Reformed tradition broadly. His Decades — fifty sermons on Reformed doctrine — were required reading for English clergy.
