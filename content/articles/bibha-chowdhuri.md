## Summary

Bibha Chowdhuri was an Indian physicist who contributed to the discovery of the pi meson (pion) through her cosmic ray research in the 1930s-40s. Working with D.M. Bose at the Bose Institute, she used photographic emulsions to detect cosmic ray particles. Despite her early contributions, she received little recognition compared to her male colleagues.
