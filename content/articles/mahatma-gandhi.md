## Summary

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948), honorifically called Mahatma ("great soul"), was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. Gandhi inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world through his philosophy of satyagraha ("truth force")—peaceful civil disobedience. Born in British India, he trained as a lawyer in London, then spent 21 years in South Africa fighting discrimination against Indians. Returning to India (1915), he organized peasants, farmers, and urban laborers to protest excessive land-tax and discrimination. Leading nationwide campaigns for self-rule (swaraj), Gandhi became the preeminent leader of Indian nationalism. Assassinated in 1948 by a Hindu nationalist who opposed his tolerance toward Muslims, Gandhi's legacy of nonviolence influenced Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and countless others.
