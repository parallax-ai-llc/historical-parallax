## Summary

Ii Naomasa (井伊 直政, March 4, 1561 – March 24, 1602) was one of the most celebrated samurai generals of the Sengoku period, serving as a trusted commander under Tokugawa Ieyasu and recognized as the youngest of the Tokugawa Shitennō (Four Heavenly Kings). Born into tragedy when his father was executed for false treason charges, Naomasa rose from orphaned obscurity to become one of Japan's most formidable military leaders, commanding the fearsome "Red Devils" (Akaoni) unit whose crimson armor struck terror into enemy ranks. His dual mastery of diplomatic negotiation and battlefield prowess made him indispensable to Ieyasu's rise to power, though his aggressive combat style ultimately led to his premature death at age 41 from wounds sustained at the Battle of Sekigahara. His descendants would rule the prestigious Hikone domain for over 260 years, cementing the Ii clan's enduring influence in Japanese history.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Ii Naomasa was born on March 4, 1561, in Hōda Village of Tōtōmi Province (present-day western Shizuoka Prefecture), with the childhood name Toramatsu (虎松), later changed to Manchiyo (万千代). He was born into the Ii clan, a hereditary samurai family that had long served the Imagawa clan and claimed descent from Fujiwara Tomoyasu, the son of the sixth descendant of Fujiwara Fuyutsugu (775-826), who lived in the Ii Valley (Iinoya).[^3][^4] The Ii clan historically held equal standing with the Tokugawa clan, a relationship that would prove crucial to Naomasa's later career.[^5]

Tragedy struck when Naomasa was merely two years old. His father, Ii Naochika, was falsely accused of treason by Imagawa Ujizane, the son of Imagawa Yoshimoto, following the latter's death at the Battle of Okehazama in 1560. This accusation led to Naochika's exile and subsequent execution in January 1563.[^6][^7] At the tender age of three, Naomasa became an orphan, facing the very real threat of being hunted down to eliminate any potential revenge from the Ii line.

The young Toramatsu's survival depended on protection and subterfuge. He was taken under the guardianship of Ii Naotora, a remarkable female leader who succeeded as head of the Ii clan during this crisis period.[^8][^9] To further protect the child from danger, his mother Hiyo married Matsushita Kiyokage, a vassal of the Tokugawa clan, and adopted Toramatsu into the Matsushita family, effectively hiding his true identity.[^10] The house of Ii clan invested greatly in Naomasa's education during these hidden years, preparing to eventually entrust him to Tokugawa Ieyasu as a strategic bid to save the Ii clan from complete extinction.[^11]

In 1575, when Naomasa was 15 years old, his true identity was discovered by Ieyasu himself. The young man was allowed to return to the Ii clan and changed his name to Manchiyo, marking the beginning of his meteoric rise in Tokugawa service.[^12] Following the death of his guardian Ii Naotora in September 1582, he formally assumed leadership of the Ii clan and adopted the name Naomasa.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Ii Naomasa commenced his service to the Tokugawa in the mid-1570s, immediately distinguishing himself through both martial prowess and keen intelligence. His youth was no impediment; Tokugawa Ieyasu recognized Naomasa's inherent abilities and took him on as a close apprentice, understanding the critical need not only for military power but also for exceptional negotiating ability in the tumultuous Sengoku period.[^14][^15] Despite being 19 years younger than Ieyasu, Naomasa quickly earned his lord's highest regard and trust.[^16]

At age 22, Naomasa performed a distinguishing military service against the Takeda clan at the Siege of Takatenjin in 1581.[^17] However, his rise to prominence truly accelerated following the collapse of the Takeda clan in 1582. In March of that year, Naomasa demonstrated both strategic thinking and diplomatic skill by absorbing many of the defeated Takeda samurai vassals into his own ranks. He made a blood pact with 70 samurai warriors from the Tsuchiya clan that had formerly served one of the Twenty-Four Generals of Takeda Shingen.[^18][^19]

This absorption of former Takeda warriors proved pivotal in multiple ways. Naomasa adopted the distinctive practice of Yamagata Masakage, one of Takeda Shingen's most feared generals, whose elite cavalry wore crimson armor for psychological impact.[^20][^21] The tradition of red-armored troops (akazonae) had reportedly been started by Obu Toramasa, Masakage's elder brother, and represented the pinnacle of Takeda military tactics.[^22] Modern historian Michifumi Isoda has argued that this incorporation of former Takeda vassals, including Yamagata Masakage's elite red brigade cavalry entering Naomasa's command, was a crucial factor in why the Tokugawa clan ultimately conquered Japan.[^23][^24]

The young general's diplomatic acumen was tested early and often. In 1582, during a tense standoff between the Tokugawa and Hōjō clans, Ieyasu chose the 22-year-old Naomasa—still a relatively unknown figure—to negotiate peace. The selection was strategic: the Imagawa clan, to which the Ii family had historically served, had maintained an alliance with the Hōjō clan. Based on this historical connection and Naomasa's position as head of the Ii family, the Hōjō clan welcomed him as a negotiator.[^25][^26] The Hōjō sent Hōjō Ujinobu as their representative, while Tokugawa sent Naomasa, and the negotiations successfully averted conflict.[^27]

Following peace negotiations between Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Naomasa's diplomatic skills were again put to use when Hideyoshi's mother, Ōmandokoro, was sent to stay with Naomasa in what amounted to gentle captivity, cementing an alliance between the Tokugawa and the Toyotomi.[^28][^29] This arrangement demonstrated the extraordinary trust both sides placed in the young general's diplomatic handling.

## Major Achievements

### The Birth of the Red Devils

Naomasa's most iconic achievement was the creation and leadership of the legendary "Ii's Red Devils" (Ii no Akaoni or Akazonae). Not satisfied with merely adopting red armor for his samurai, Naomasa outfitted his entire force in crimson: infantry, riflemen, archers wore red armor, horses were adorned with red barding, and red banners were crafted for all units.[^30][^31] His elite troops became synonymous with red armor in Japan, and the psychological impact was immense.[^32]

The Red Devils' baptism of fire came at the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute in 1584 against Hashiba (later Toyotomi) Hideyoshi. On April 9, 1584, during the Battle of Nagakute, the 24-year-old Naomasa was entrusted to lead approximately 3,000 soldiers on the left wing of the Tokugawa forces.[^33][^34] At around 10 a.m., Naomasa's forces clashed against the troops of Ikeda Tsuneoki. The fearsome sight of a wall of red-armored samurai crashing down on the enemy put fear into their ranks.[^35][^36]

The battle lasted over two hours, as Naomasa's units repeatedly foiled attempted charges toward his position by Tsuneoki and Mori Nagayoshi's troops with devastating musket rifle barrages. Eventually, Nagayoshi was shot and killed in action, causing the Tokugawa forces to gain the upper hand amid the chaos.[^37] Naomasa, commanding approximately three thousand musketeers with distinction, contributed to the collapse of the Toyotomi formation by pressing the attack, forcing survivors to flee toward Nagakute.[^38][^39] His performance was so exceptional that it elicited praise from Toyotomi Hideyoshi himself, despite being on the opposing side.[^40]

### Diplomatic Mastermind

While Naomasa's military exploits earned him fame, his diplomatic achievements were equally significant. Ieyasu repeatedly chose Naomasa for the most sensitive diplomatic missions, recognizing his exceptional skills in negotiation and statecraft.[^41] During the recruitment of former Takeda samurai, Naomasa played a pivotal diplomatic role, receiving around 41 letters from many former Takeda clan vassals seeking to submit to Ieyasu.[^42]

Between 1598 and 1600, as tensions built toward the decisive conflict at Sekigahara, Ieyasu tasked Naomasa with negotiating for Toyotomi generals to conclude alliances with the Tokugawa.[^43] This was no simple task—these were proud, powerful warriors who had served under Hideyoshi, and convincing them to betray or abandon their former allegiances required extraordinary persuasive ability. Naomasa succeeded brilliantly, attracting Hideyoshi's brave generals such as Fukushima Masanori and Katō Kiyomasa to join the Tokugawa faction.[^44] Additionally, he managed to force the powerful Mori clan to refrain from entering the battlefield, significantly weakening the Western forces before battle was even joined.[^45]

### Siege of Odawara (1590)

During the 1590 siege of Odawara Castle, Naomasa again demonstrated innovative tactical thinking. While the rest of the Tokugawa army was content to wait for the Hōjō defenders to starve into submission—a conventional siege approach—Naomasa took initiative. He had engineers dig a tunnel underneath the castle walls, then moved all his troops through it in the middle of the night, catching the defenders completely off guard.[^46] His actions played a pivotal role in breaching the castle defenses and led to the surrender of the Hōjō clan.[^47] For this achievement, he was awarded Minowa Castle in Takasaki, Gunma, making him the largest landholder among Tokugawa retainers with holdings worth some 120,000 koku.[^48][^49]

### Battle of Sekigahara (1600)

The Battle of Sekigahara on October 21, 1600, would prove to be both Naomasa's finest hour and the beginning of his end. By this time, he had been assigned as Assistant Deputy General of the Eastern Camp along with Honda Tadakatsu, becoming a key figure in commanding the Eastern forces.[^50] Naomasa commanded a key division of shock troops in Ieyasu's army, and his crimson-clad warriors were positioned to make the critical first strike.[^51]

On the morning of October 21, a thick fog blanketed the valley until 8:00 a.m. As the fog lifted, Naomasa's shock troops circumvented their own vanguard command—breaking Ieyasu's designated battle order—and made contact with the Ukita forces, drawing the "first blood" of the battle.[^52][^53] Modern historians debate whether this was deliberate insubordination or the result of confusion caused by the heavy fog; some suggest Naomasa may have unintentionally started the first clash against the enemy due to poor visibility.[^54]

Regardless of intent, Naomasa's force was the first of the Eastern Army to engage with Ishida Mitsunari's Western Army, and they fought with characteristic ferocity.[^55] The battle raged for seven hours, with Naomasa's Red Devils at the forefront of the conflict. Near the battle's conclusion, when Mitsunari's defeat was apparent, Naomasa engaged Shimazu Yoshihiro, who had held a stationary position.[^56]

At approximately 1:30 p.m., Yoshihiro and his men began their famous "retreat of honor," fighting their way through encircling forces. As Naomasa pursued them, a volley of arquebus fire struck him.[^57] According to detailed accounts, a Satsuma samurai named Kashiwagi Gendo took this opportunity to shoot at Ii Naomasa, hitting him squarely—some sources say in the chest, others in the right arm—and knocking him off his horse.[^58][^59] The matchlock rifle used to shoot Ii Naomasa is currently preserved in the collection of the Shoko Shuseikan Museum.[^60]

Despite his severe wound, Naomasa insisted on remaining on the battlefield until the Eastern victory was complete.[^61] The Shimazu troops only managed to break their encirclement after devastating casualties, escaping with only 200 soldiers remaining out of their original force.[^62]

For his extraordinary service at Sekigahara, Naomasa received the Sawayama Domain in Ōmi Province, which had previously belonged to the defeated Ishida Mitsunari. His fief was increased from 120,000 koku to an impressive 180,000 koku, making him one of the most powerful daimyo in Japan.[^63][^64][^65] After the battle, when Katsunari immediately wrote to Ii Naomasa asking that Ieyasu pardon Tanenaga, Ieyasu accepted, demonstrating the influence Naomasa wielded.[^66]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his legendary status, Ii Naomasa was not without flaws or critics, both during his lifetime and in subsequent historical analysis. Modern scholarship has increasingly challenged the purely heroic narrative, revealing a more complex and sometimes problematic figure.

### Recklessness and Poor Command Judgment

One of the most significant criticisms came from his own contemporaries. Honda Tadakatsu, one of his fellow members of the Tokugawa Four Heavenly Kings, criticized Naomasa's recklessness on multiple occasions.[^67] Modern historian Hiroyuki Kikuchi has questioned Naomasa's leadership quality, citing research by Noda Hiroko showing that during the Battle of Komaki-Nagakute, Naomasa acted recklessly by personally fighting on the frontline and engaging in melee combat with enemy soldiers rather than commanding from the rear.[^68][^69]

This prompted his subordinate, Andō Naotsugu, to openly chastise Naomasa for his recklessness, arguing that a military commander should focus on giving commands rather than fighting like a common soldier.[^70] This criticism didn't initially sink in; during the Tenshō-Jingo Conflict, Naomasa's lone charge placed himself and many others in danger, demonstrating a pattern of behavior that prioritized personal glory over sound tactical command.[^71]

### Perfectionism and Judgmental Nature

Naomasa was known as a harsh perfectionist who was highly judgmental of others. If someone didn't act to his standards, he had a habit of saying "No good. No good at all."[^72] This created tension within the ranks and made him a difficult commander to serve under. Initially, Naomasa believed he was capable of defending the Tokugawa on his own terms, judging all others to be either too obedient or too inadequate to be proper guards.[^73] He was too prideful to listen to the counsel of his elders like Tadakatsu, instead choosing to be hostile toward those who questioned his methods.[^74]

### Insubordination at Sekigahara

The incident at Sekigahara where Naomasa's forces circumvented their own vanguard command and struck first has been interpreted by some historians as deliberate insubordination. While modern scholars debate whether heavy fog caused confusion or whether Naomasa intentionally broke Ieyasu's orders to claim the honor of first blood, the fact remains that his actions contradicted the established battle plan.[^75] This competitive drive to outpace other generals such as Fukushima Masanori in claiming glory could have jeopardized the coordinated Eastern strategy had circumstances been different.[^76]

### Self-Destructive Combat Style

Naomasa is often characterized as the opposite of Honda Tadakatsu in terms of combat philosophy. While Honda famously survived countless battles without suffering significant injuries through careful tactical positioning, Naomasa suffered terrible injuries throughout his career due to his aggressive, frontline combat style.[^77] He would gladly dash headfirst into danger with no regard for his own safety, often not aware of how much others worried that his resolve might prove self-destructive.[^78] This prediction ultimately proved correct when his wounds from Sekigahara led to his premature death, depriving the Tokugawa administration of one of its most talented commanders and diplomats at a crucial period of consolidation.

## Personal Life

### Marriage and Family

Ii Naomasa married Tobai-in (also referred to as Hana in some sources), who was the daughter of Matsudaira Yasuchika and an adopted daughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu himself.[^79][^80] This strategic marriage built close relations between the Ii clan and the Matsudaira clan, further cementing Naomasa's position within the inner circle of Tokugawa power.[^81]

Naomasa had five children, including several sons who would continue his legacy.[^82] His son Ii Naokatsu completed the construction of Hikone Castle in 1622, twenty years after his father's death and long after the initial construction had begun.[^83] However, family succession proved complicated. Naomasa had wished for his illegitimate son Ii Naotaka to inherit his domain, but instead, Ii Naokatsu succeeded him, contrary to his father's final wishes.[^84]

The Ii family would prove to be one of the most durable and influential samurai lineages in Japanese history. The Hikone domain, passed down through generations of Naomasa's descendants, survived until 1871, with its last ruler from the Ii clan being Ii Naonori.[^85] After the establishment of the Edo shogunate, the Ii family ruled as feudal lords of the Hikone domain throughout the entire period, remaining highly influential as loyal retainers and advisers to the Tokugawa for over 260 years.[^86][^87]

One of the most famous descendants was Ii Naosuke, who served as Tairō (Great Elder) at the end of the shogunate period and led the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan.[^88] Like his ancestor, Naosuke shared the nickname "the Red Ghost of Ii" (井伊の赤鬼).[^89] In more recent times, the sixteenth scion of the Hikone Ii family, Naoyoshi, served as mayor of Hikone from 1953 to 1989, demonstrating the family's continued prominence in regional affairs.[^90]

### Personality and Character

Ii Naomasa was known for his unwavering loyalty toward his clan and his steadfast adherence to the code of Bushido, making him an honorable warrior who was always true to his word.[^91][^92] He possessed a willingness to put his life on the line for what he believed was right, a quality that earned him deep respect but also led to his premature demise.[^93]

Despite his tough exterior and fierce reputation on the battlefield, Naomasa had a softer side. He cared deeply for his fellow warriors and offered support when needed.[^94] His youthful strength and collected character drew admiration from others, even as his perfectionist tendencies created challenges.[^95]

Naomasa underwent significant personal growth throughout his career. Initially too prideful and reckless, he eventually learned to collaborate with his comrades and gained newfound maturity, which led others to entrust him with Ii clan leadership.[^96] He is characterized by confidence, assertiveness, and a strong sense of control, particularly in his leadership style and willingness to take charge in difficult situations.[^97] His exceptional leadership skills allowed him to rally warriors and inspire them to face formidable foes.[^98]

### Physical Appearance and Equipment

Despite his small physical stature, Naomasa fought ferociously on the battlefield wearing distinguishable red armor and a helmet with long golden horns, which earned him the nickname "Aka-oni" (red demon).[^99] The armor Naomasa wore reached an impressive 60 kg in weight, fully coated in shu-urushi (red lacquer).[^100] His sets of armor are all preserved and exhibited within Hikone Castle Museum, providing tangible connections to this legendary warrior.[^101]

When explaining his choice of red armor, Naomasa reportedly said: "I do it so that I stand out. I want everyone to know that the Ii are on the battlefield. Some enemies flee at the very sight."[^102] This statement encapsulates his understanding of psychological warfare and his desire to build a reputation that would precede him into battle.

## Legacy

### Immediate Impact and Death

Ii Naomasa's wound from Sekigahara was one from which he would never fully recover.[^103] Unable to participate in the mopping-up operations against Mitsunari's allies following the battle, he withdrew to manage his new domain.[^104] At first, he resided in Sawayama Castle, but he was dissatisfied with its situation. The castle was considered obsolete with weak defenses, divided between hilltop and hillside areas, and it carried strong associations with the former regime as the stronghold of the defeated enemy leader.[^105][^106]

It was decided to move the castle from Sawayama to Hikoneyama, and the fief became known as Hikone.[^107] Construction began on what would become the magnificent Hikone Castle, using materials from the dismantled castles at Sawayama, Ōtsu, Odani, and Kanon-ji.[^108] In an act symbolizing the complete break with the past, Sawayama Castle was dismantled completely, with workers scraping off the top of the mountain down to about fifteen meters to remove nearly all trace of the keep, exposing the bedrock.[^109]

However, Naomasa died on March 24, 1602, when construction had just begun, his death evidently resulting from his Sekigahara wound.[^110][^111] Most sources confirm he died in 1602, though one account suggests he may have died in 1601, just one year after sustaining his injuries.[^112] He was only 41 years old, cut down in what should have been the prime of his administrative career, at a time when his diplomatic skills and military experience would have been invaluable to the newly established Tokugawa order.

### The Continuation of the Red Devils

Though Naomasa died young, his legacy lived on through his descendants and his legendary military unit. His sons took over command of the Red Devils, and at the Battle of Osaka in 1615, they were front and center of the blood-soaked conflict, charging in an epic attack that crushed enemy forces and left over half of the opposing force—including their clan leadership—dead or dying on the field.[^113]

### The Hikone Domain's Influence

The Hikone domain continued to receive strong support from the shogunate and produced five Tairō (Great Elders), the highest ranks of Tokugawa administration, steadfastly backing the shogunate for 260 years.[^114] This demonstrates the enduring trust and influence the Ii clan maintained throughout the Edo period, a testament to the foundation Naomasa had built.

The family's loyalty and administrative competence ensured their position among the most prestigious and powerful daimyo families in Japan. The Ii clan's equal historical standing with the Tokugawa clan, dating back to before Naomasa's time, combined with his achievements, created a unique position where the Ii could serve as trusted counselors while maintaining significant autonomy.[^115]

### Cultural and Symbolic Impact

So well known were the Akazonae (red guards) of the Ii clan that they became synonymous with red armor in Japan.[^116] The image of crimson-clad samurai became indelibly associated with elite military prowess and unwavering loyalty. The psychological impact of the Red Devils was so significant that the tradition influenced military thinking and iconography for generations.

Naomasa's armor and weapons, preserved in the Hikone Castle Museum, continue to attract visitors and scholars, serving as tangible connections to the Sengoku period.[^117] The Portrait of Ii Naomasa, also housed in the museum, depicts the first head of the Ii family who became a vassal of Tokugawa Ieyasu at age 15, commemorating his remarkable rise from orphaned child to one of Japan's most powerful lords.[^118]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Traditional historiography has long celebrated Ii Naomasa as one of the greatest samurai of his era. According to Sakakibara clan historical records, among Ieyasu's generals, Honda Tadakatsu excelled in bravery and Sakakibara Yasumasa excelled in leadership, while Ii Naomasa uniquely possessed both qualities in equal measure.[^119] This assessment places him as perhaps the most balanced and complete warrior among the legendary Four Heavenly Kings.

His recognition as one of the Four Guardians of the Tokugawa alongside Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Sakai Tadatsugu speaks to his exceptional status.[^120] What makes this achievement even more remarkable is that Naomasa was the only one of the four Tokugawa Shitennō who did not come from Mikawa, Ieyasu's home province.[^121] His outsider status, combined with the tragic circumstances of his childhood, makes his rise to the inner circle of Tokugawa power all the more impressive.

Modern historiography, while more critical in some respects, still affirms Naomasa's tactical acumen and diplomatic genius. Scholars recognize that his adept negotiating skills continuously played a pivotal role in Ieyasu's efforts toward national unification.[^122] The successful recruitment of Fukushima Masanori, Katō Kiyomasa, and the neutralization of the Mori clan before Sekigahara represent diplomatic achievements of the highest order, potentially as important to the Eastern victory as any military maneuvers on the battlefield itself.[^123]

The incorporation of former Takeda vassals into the Tokugawa forces, facilitated by Naomasa, is now recognized by historians such as Michifumi Isoda as a crucial factor in the Tokugawa conquest of Japan.[^124] This demonstrates strategic vision beyond mere battlefield tactics—Naomasa understood that winning the hearts and minds of defeated enemies could be as valuable as destroying them.

### Negative Views and Scholarly Critiques

Modern scholarship has increasingly challenged aspects of the traditional heroic narrative, presenting a more nuanced and sometimes critical assessment. The research by historian Noda Hiroko, highlighted by Hiroyuki Kikuchi, raises serious questions about Naomasa's command capabilities. The evidence that he personally engaged in frontline melee combat rather than directing his forces from an appropriate command position suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of a general's role, or at minimum, an inability to control his aggressive impulses even when they compromised his command responsibilities.[^125]

The criticism from Andō Naotsugu, Naomasa's own subordinate, is particularly damning because it comes from within his command structure. That a subordinate felt compelled to openly chastise his commanding officer for not behaving like a proper military commander indicates the severity of the problem.[^126] This wasn't merely a difference in tactical philosophy; it represented a potential danger to the entire unit when their commander was engaged in personal combat rather than directing operations.

Some modern historians view the incident at Sekigahara where Naomasa's forces struck first as potentially problematic insubordination rather than heroic initiative. The reassessment suggests that confusion caused by heavy fog may have led to an accidental breaking of Ieyasu's orders rather than a calculated tactical decision.[^127] If true, this reframes what was traditionally seen as bold leadership as potentially dangerous lack of coordination that could have disrupted the Eastern army's battle plan.

Critics also point to Naomasa's self-destructive combat style as evidence of poor judgment and misplaced priorities. Unlike Honda Tadakatsu, who survived countless battles through skillful tactics and careful positioning, Naomasa's approach resulted in repeated serious injuries that culminated in his death at 41.[^128] From a strategic perspective, a commander who gets himself killed—thus depriving his lord of his services—has failed in a fundamental duty, regardless of how brave or effective he was in individual combat encounters.
