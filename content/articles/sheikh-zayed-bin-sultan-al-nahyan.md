## Summary

Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (6 May 1918 – 2 November 2004) was the founding father and first president of the United Arab Emirates, serving from the nation's independence in 1971 until his death in 2004.[^1] Known as the "Father of the Nation," he transformed Abu Dhabi from a desert sheikhdom dependent on pearl diving into one of the world's wealthiest and most modern states through strategic use of oil revenues.[^2] His visionary leadership unified seven disparate emirates into a single federation, while his commitment to education, healthcare, and infrastructure development created lasting prosperity for Emirati citizens.[^3] Beyond the UAE's borders, Sheikh Zayed became renowned as a wise Arab statesman, generous philanthropist, and pioneering environmentalist who planted millions of trees in the desert and saved endangered species from extinction.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan was born on 6 May 1918 at Qasr Al Hosn in Abu Dhabi, though the exact date remains uncertain in some historical records.[^1] He was the youngest of four sons born to Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who ruled Abu Dhabi from 1922 to 1926, and his mother was Sheikha Salama bint Butti.[^5] The young Zayed was named after his illustrious grandfather, Sheikh Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, known as "Zayed the Great," who had ruled the emirate from 1855 to 1909 and was remembered as a powerful and respected leader throughout the region.[^6]

The world into which Sheikh Zayed was born bore little resemblance to the modern metropolis Abu Dhabi would become. The emirate was desperately poor, with an economy based primarily on pearl diving, fishing, and limited agriculture in scattered inland oases.[^7] The harsh desert environment shaped the character of its people, who relied on Bedouin traditions of hospitality, tribal loyalty, and resilience in the face of adversity. Young Zayed received a traditional Islamic education, learning the Quran and absorbing the values and customs of his people.[^8]

When Sheikh Zayed's father died in 1926, the boy was only eight years old. He moved from Abu Dhabi to the inland oasis city of Al Ain, where he would spend formative years that deeply influenced his worldview.[^9] In Al Ain, Zayed developed a profound connection to the desert and its ecology, learning traditional water management through the falaj irrigation system and developing expertise in falconry and desert survival skills that would remain lifelong passions.[^10] The experience of living close to the land in Al Ain also instilled in him an early appreciation for agriculture and environmental conservation, values that would later define much of his legacy.

During his youth, Zayed observed the struggles of his people and the challenges facing the ruling family. His eldest brother, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan, became the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1928 and would govern for nearly four decades.[^11] Young Zayed learned patience, diplomacy, and the art of leadership through observation and participation in the traditional majlis system, where rulers held open councils to hear the concerns of their subjects. These early experiences taught him that effective leadership required accessibility, listening, and responding to the needs of ordinary people—principles that would guide his own governing philosophy.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Sheikh Zayed's path to leadership began in 1946 when his brother, Sheikh Shakhbut, appointed him as the Ruler's Representative in the Eastern Region, which included the oasis city of Al Ain.[^13] This appointment gave Zayed his first opportunity to demonstrate his administrative capabilities and vision for development. For twenty years, from 1946 to 1966, he governed the Eastern Region with remarkable effectiveness, implementing progressive policies that improved agriculture, built schools, and strengthened tribal relations.[^14] He settled disputes among Bedouin tribes, modernized the falaj irrigation systems, and encouraged agricultural development, earning a reputation as a fair and innovative administrator.

The discovery of oil in Abu Dhabi in 1958, with exports beginning in 1962, marked a turning point that would eventually lead to Sheikh Zayed's ascension to power.[^15] The newly found petroleum wealth created enormous potential for transforming the impoverished emirate, yet Sheikh Shakhbut proved extremely cautious—many said excessively so—about spending oil revenues on development projects.[^16] While Abu Dhabi's coffers filled with oil money, the emirate remained largely undeveloped, lacking basic infrastructure, modern healthcare, and educational institutions. Frustration grew among members of the ruling Al Nahyan family and within the broader population about missed opportunities for progress.

On 6 August 1966, the family's patience reached its breaking point. With the unanimous backing of the Al Nahyan family and the acquiescence of the British, who still oversaw foreign affairs and defense in the Trucial States, Sheikh Shakhbut was deposed in a bloodless palace coup.[^17] Sheikh Zayed replaced his brother as Ruler of Abu Dhabi, immediately signaling his intent to use oil wealth for rapid modernization and development.[^18] The transition, while representing a significant change in leadership, was conducted peacefully and respectfully, with Sheikh Shakhbut retiring comfortably—a testament to Zayed's character and the family's unity.

As Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Zayed quickly began implementing the development vision he had refined during his years in Al Ain. He launched massive infrastructure projects, built hospitals and schools, constructed roads and housing, and established systems to distribute oil wealth among citizens.[^19] His success in transforming Abu Dhabi soon attracted attention throughout the region. When Britain announced in 1968 its intention to withdraw from the Persian Gulf by 1971, Sheikh Zayed emerged as the driving force behind efforts to unite the Trucial States into a single federation.[^20]

Sheikh Zayed pursued the unification project with determination and diplomatic skill, overcoming significant obstacles including territorial disputes, tribal rivalries, and competing interests among the various rulers. He offered to share Abu Dhabi's oil wealth with less fortunate emirates, demonstrating the generosity and strategic vision that would characterize his leadership.[^21] On 2 December 1971, six emirates—Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm Al Quwain, and Fujairah—formally established the United Arab Emirates, with Sheikh Zayed elected as the federation's first president.[^22] Ras Al Khaimah joined shortly afterward in February 1972, completing the seven-emirate union that exists today.[^23]

## Major Achievements

Sheikh Zayed's most monumental achievement was the creation and successful consolidation of the United Arab Emirates itself. Unifying seven independent sheikhdoms with distinct ruling families, tribal allegiances, and sometimes competing interests required extraordinary diplomatic skill, patience, and vision.[^24] Where many observers predicted the federation would collapse within years, Sheikh Zayed built institutional structures and fostered a sense of shared national identity that has endured for over five decades. He was re-elected as president six consecutive times, serving continuously from 1971 until his death in 2004—a testament to his leadership and the trust placed in him by his fellow rulers and citizens.[^25]

The transformation of the UAE's physical infrastructure and economy under Sheikh Zayed's leadership was nothing short of miraculous. When he became ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966, the emirate had virtually no paved roads, modern buildings, or public services. By the time of his death in 2004, the UAE boasted world-class cities with towering skyscrapers, an extensive highway network, state-of-the-art airports, modern seaports, and telecommunications infrastructure rivaling any developed nation.[^26] From 1968 to 2002, more than AED 162 billion was allocated for development projects in Abu Dhabi alone, including homes, healthcare facilities, educational institutions, roads, bridges, electricity, and water systems.[^27]

Sheikh Zayed revolutionized education and healthcare in the UAE, making both free and universally accessible to all citizens. He understood that human capital was the nation's most valuable resource, famously declaring: "The real asset of any advanced nation is its people, especially the educated ones, and the prosperity and success of the people are measured by the standard of their education."[^28] Under his leadership, the UAE established universities, technical colleges, and thousands of schools, while sending countless students abroad for higher education. Literacy rates soared, and Emiratis gained access to educational opportunities their grandparents could never have imagined.[^29]

In healthcare, Sheikh Zayed oversaw the construction of modern hospitals and clinics throughout the emirates, ensuring that even residents in remote areas had access to quality medical care. The transformation in public health was dramatic—infant mortality rates plummeted, life expectancy increased substantially, and diseases that once plagued the region were brought under control.[^30] Sheikh Zayed also pioneered progressive policies regarding women's rights, supporting women's education and participation in society while respecting Islamic values, stating: "Islam affords women their rightful status, and encourages them to work in all sectors, as long as they are afforded appropriate respect."[^31]

Economic diversification was another cornerstone of Sheikh Zayed's vision. While oil wealth provided the foundation for development, he recognized the dangers of over-dependence on a single commodity. "We must not rely on oil alone as the main source of our national income," he declared. "We have to diversify the sources of our revenue and construct economic projects that will ensure a free, stable and dignified life for the people."[^32] Under his leadership, the UAE invested heavily in aluminum production, petrochemicals, banking and finance, tourism, and other sectors, laying the groundwork for the diversified economy the nation enjoys today.

Sheikh Zayed's commitment to environmental conservation set him apart from many leaders of oil-producing nations. Despite the country's petroleum-based wealth, he launched ambitious programs to green the desert, ordering the planting of more than 140 million trees throughout Abu Dhabi.[^33] He established forestry and forestation projects in the 1970s, promoted sustainable agriculture, and planted extensive mangrove forests along the coastline.[^34] His efforts to save endangered species, particularly the Arabian oryx, achieved remarkable success—in 1978, only four Arabian oryx were transferred from Al Ain to Sir Bani Yas Island for breeding; today, the population exceeds 6,200.[^35]

On the regional and international stage, Sheikh Zayed established himself as a respected Arab statesman and generous philanthropist. He was a founding member and leading force behind the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), working to unite Gulf countries with similar economies and social structures into a formal regional entity.[^36] During the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, he demonstrated his commitment to Arab solidarity by supporting Egypt and Syria and imposing an oil boycott, famously declaring: "Arab oil is not dearer than Arab blood."[^37] Through the Abu Dhabi Fund for Arab Economic Development and the Zayed Charitable and Humanitarian Foundation, he channeled substantial resources to approximately forty less fortunate Islamic nations in Asia and Africa.[^38]

Sheikh Zayed's governing philosophy centered on accessibility and responsiveness to his people. He maintained the traditional majlis system, holding regular open councils where any citizen could approach him directly with concerns or requests.[^39] These majlises ensured social cohesion, fostered economic reform, and gave ordinary people a direct voice in policy decisions. His method of governance, combining traditional Arab values with modern administrative efficiency, created a unique political model that balanced rapid development with cultural continuity.[^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his widespread acclaim within the UAE and much of the Arab world, Sheikh Zayed's legacy includes aspects that have drawn criticism from international observers and human rights organizations. The political system he established maintained absolute monarchy without elected representative institutions or political parties.[^41] While the Federal National Council exists as a consultative body, it has historically lacked legislative power, and political freedoms remain restricted compared to democratic nations. Critics argue that the UAE's authoritarian governance structure, consolidated under Sheikh Zayed's leadership, limits political expression and denies citizens meaningful participation in governance.[^42]

Press freedom and civil liberties faced significant constraints throughout Sheikh Zayed's rule. Media censorship, restrictions on freedom of assembly, and limitations on civil society organizations characterized the UAE's political environment.[^43] While Sheikh Zayed's open majlis system allowed direct petitioning, it operated within strict boundaries that discouraged fundamental challenges to the ruling system. International human rights organizations have documented concerns about political prisoners, restrictions on freedom of expression, and the absence of robust legal protections for dissent.[^44]

The treatment of migrant workers, who constitute the vast majority of the UAE's population, represents perhaps the most significant ongoing criticism related to policies established during Sheikh Zayed's era. The kafala (sponsorship) system, which ties workers' legal status to their employers, has been widely criticized for creating conditions vulnerable to exploitation and abuse.[^45] While Sheikh Zayed oversaw economic development that created employment for millions of foreign workers, labor rights protections remained inadequate. Reports of poor working conditions, wage theft, passport confiscation, and inadequate housing for construction workers and domestic employees have persisted.[^46]

Women's rights, while advanced compared to some regional neighbors under Sheikh Zayed's rule, remained constrained by laws and social norms that limited equality. Personal status laws based on conservative interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence gave men advantages in divorce, child custody, and inheritance.[^47] While Sheikh Zayed supported women's education and workforce participation, structural inequalities persisted. Male guardianship requirements, limitations on women's independence, and legal discrimination in various areas drew criticism from international women's rights advocates.[^48]

Sheikh Zayed's foreign policy decisions occasionally generated controversy. His support for various Arab and Islamic causes sometimes involved backing groups or governments criticized internationally. The UAE's positions on regional conflicts, its relationships with various political movements, and its role in broader Middle Eastern politics drew scrutiny and criticism from different quarters.[^49] Critics have also questioned the wisdom of the UAE's military interventions and foreign policy stances adopted or initiated during his leadership, arguing they entangled the young nation in costly and controversial regional conflicts.[^50]

Environmental critics point to contradictions between Sheikh Zayed's celebrated tree-planting initiatives and the UAE's enormous per-capita carbon footprint and environmental impact from oil extraction, energy-intensive desalination, and construction.[^51] While his conservation efforts were genuine and achieved real results, they coexisted with an economic model based on fossil fuel extraction and resource-intensive development that contributed significantly to climate change and environmental degradation.[^52]

The enormous wealth disparity between Emirati citizens, who enjoy generous welfare benefits and subsidies, and the millions of expatriate workers who built the nation's infrastructure has raised questions about distributive justice.[^53] While Sheikh Zayed's policies ensured prosperity for his citizens, critics argue this created a rigid two-tier system that denies basic rights and pathways to citizenship for the majority of the UAE's long-term residents.[^54]

## Personal Life

Sheikh Zayed married multiple times throughout his life, a practice permissible under Islamic law and common among Gulf rulers of his generation. Sources indicate he married six wives, though some accounts vary on the exact number.[^55] Among his wives were Sheikha Hassa bint Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, his first wife who was born on 17 June 1922 and died on 28 January 2018; Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi, who became one of his most influential wives and a prominent advocate for women's rights in the UAE; and Sheikha Mouza bint Suhail Al Khaili.[^56] Sheikha Hassa was Sheikh Zayed's first cousin on both her father's and mother's sides, reflecting the common practice of cousin marriage within Gulf ruling families to maintain tribal bonds and political alliances.[^57]

Sheikh Zayed fathered a large family, with sources reporting between 29 and 30 children.[^58] His sons and daughters would go on to play prominent roles in the UAE's government, military, business sector, and diplomatic corps. Among his most prominent sons are Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who succeeded him as President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi; Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who became Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and later succeeded Sheikh Khalifa as president; and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, whose mother is Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak Al Ketbi, and who has served in various government positions while also becoming known internationally for his ownership of Manchester City Football Club.[^59]

Despite his political power and immense wealth, those who knew Sheikh Zayed described him as personally modest and deeply rooted in Bedouin traditions. He maintained a preference for traditional dress, spoke in the Bedouin dialect, and regularly engaged in falconry and camel racing—sports that connected him to his cultural heritage.[^60] His love for the desert and its wildlife was genuine and lifelong, not merely ceremonial. He would often spend time in the desert, where he felt most at home, and his passion for falcons was legendary among those close to him.[^61]

Sheikh Zayed's personality combined patience with determination, generosity with shrewdness, and traditional values with progressive vision. He earned the title "the wise man of the Arabs" for his diplomatic skill, measured judgment, and ability to mediate disputes among regional leaders.[^62] His open majlis sessions revealed a leader who genuinely listened to his subjects, regardless of their social status. Stories of his personal generosity are numerous—he would often respond to individual requests for assistance with immediate financial support or intervention to solve problems.[^63]

His daily routine reflected his hands-on leadership style. Sheikh Zayed rose early, attended to correspondence and meetings, held majlis sessions where citizens could approach him directly, and remained engaged with both domestic and international affairs late into the evening.[^64] Despite the demands of leadership, he maintained close family relationships and ensured his children understood their responsibilities as members of the ruling family. He instilled in them the values of service, the importance of education, and the duty to use their privilege for the benefit of society.[^65]

Sheikh Zayed's health declined in his later years, though he remained active in leadership until the end. He underwent kidney transplant surgery in 2000 and faced various health challenges associated with advanced age.[^66] He passed away on 2 November 2004 at the age of 86, leaving behind a transformed nation and a legacy that continues to shape the UAE's trajectory.[^67] His death was mourned throughout the UAE and the wider Arab world, with leaders from across the globe paying tribute to his vision and achievements.[^68]

## Legacy

Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan left an indelible mark not only on the United Arab Emirates but on the broader Arab world and international community. His most enduring legacy is the UAE itself—a stable, prosperous federation that has defied predictions of its collapse and become a model of development in the region.[^69] The institutional structures he built, the national identity he fostered, and the political system he established have proven remarkably durable, surviving leadership transitions and regional upheavals.[^70]

Within the UAE, Sheikh Zayed is revered with near-universal admiration as the "Father of the Nation." His image adorns currency, public buildings, and countless streets, schools, and institutions named in his honor.[^71] The government declared 2018 the "Year of Zayed" to commemorate the centenary of his birth, reflecting his continued central importance to Emirati national consciousness.[^72] For Emirati citizens who remember the pre-oil era of poverty and hardship, Sheikh Zayed's transformation of their lives from subsistence to prosperity inspires deep gratitude and loyalty that extends to his descendants.[^73]

The physical transformation of the UAE stands as perhaps the most visible aspect of Sheikh Zayed's legacy. Abu Dhabi evolved from a small settlement of barasti (palm frond) houses into a gleaming modern capital with iconic architecture, world-class infrastructure, and a quality of life ranking among the highest globally.[^74] Dubai, while developing somewhat independently under the Al Maktoum family, benefited from the federation's stability and Abu Dhabi's financial support facilitated by Sheikh Zayed's generosity.[^75] The highways, airports, ports, hospitals, universities, and other infrastructure created during his era form the foundation upon which the modern UAE continues to build.[^76]

Sheikh Zayed's environmental legacy extends beyond the UAE's borders. His pioneering work in desert greening, species conservation, and environmental protection established principles that influenced regional approaches to environmental management.[^77] He received international recognition for these efforts, including a Gold Medal from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in 1995 for agricultural development, and the Gold Panda Award from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in 1997 for environmental and wildlife conservation.[^78] The Zayed Sustainability Prize, established in 2008, continues his commitment to environmental causes by supporting innovative solutions to global sustainability challenges.[^79]

His diplomatic legacy shaped the UAE's approach to regional and international relations. Sheikh Zayed's philosophy of dialogue, moderation, and balanced foreign policy became hallmarks of Emirati diplomacy.[^80] His emphasis on humanitarian aid and development assistance established the UAE as one of the world's most generous donors per capita, a distinction the country maintains today.[^81] The Abu Dhabi Fund for Development and various charitable institutions he established continue to channel resources to developing nations across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.[^82]

The Gulf Cooperation Council, which Sheikh Zayed helped found and strengthen, remains the primary regional organization for Gulf states, facilitating cooperation on economic, security, and political matters.[^83] While the GCC has faced challenges and tensions, particularly in recent years, the framework Sheikh Zayed helped build continues to provide a platform for regional coordination.[^84]

Sheikh Zayed's governing philosophy—combining traditional Arab values with modern administrative practices—created a distinctive political model that has influenced other Gulf states. His emphasis on accessible leadership through the majlis system, generous distribution of oil wealth to citizens, and consultative decision-making established patterns that persist in the UAE and have been emulated elsewhere in the region.[^85] Whether this model remains appropriate for the 21st century and future generations is a subject of ongoing debate, but its historical impact is undeniable.[^86]

In the broader Arab world, Sheikh Zayed is remembered as a unifying figure who used his wealth and influence to support Arab causes while advocating for moderation and dialogue. His mediation efforts in various regional disputes, his support for Palestinian causes, and his leadership during critical moments like the 1973 oil embargo established him as a respected Arab statesman whose counsel was valued by leaders throughout the region.[^87] His death in 2004 was mourned across the Arab world as the loss of one of the last links to an earlier generation of Arab leaders.[^88]

For future generations, Sheikh Zayed's legacy presents both inspiration and challenges. His successors, particularly his son Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, have sought to build on his foundation while adapting to new realities.[^89] The diversification efforts Sheikh Zayed initiated have accelerated, with the UAE working to reduce oil dependence and develop a knowledge-based economy. His environmental principles have evolved into more comprehensive sustainability initiatives addressing climate change and renewable energy.[^90] The question of how to modernize the political system while preserving stability and the positive aspects of his legacy remains an ongoing challenge for the UAE's leadership and citizens.[^91]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic scholars and political analysts who view Sheikh Zayed favorably emphasize his extraordinary achievement in building a stable, prosperous nation from disparate sheikhdoms with limited resources beyond oil. Political scientist Christopher M. Davidson and other scholars of Gulf politics note that Sheikh Zayed's diplomatic skill and strategic vision were essential to the UAE's successful formation and consolidation—without his leadership, the federation likely would have collapsed or never formed at all.[^92] His ability to balance the interests of various emirates, mediate disputes, and create a sense of shared national identity demonstrated exceptional political acumen.[^93]

Economists and development specialists praise Sheikh Zayed's strategic use of oil revenues for long-term development rather than short-term consumption. His investments in infrastructure, education, and healthcare created lasting value that continues to benefit the UAE decades after the projects were initiated.[^94] The economic diversification efforts he began, though incomplete during his lifetime, positioned the UAE to transition away from oil dependence more successfully than many petroleum-producing nations.[^95] His establishment of sovereign wealth funds and strategic investments ensured that oil wealth would benefit future generations rather than being squandered by a single generation.[^96]

Environmental historians and conservationists celebrate Sheikh Zayed as a pioneering environmentalist who recognized the importance of conservation decades before it became mainstream. His tree-planting initiatives, species preservation programs, and sustainable agriculture projects demonstrated remarkable foresight about environmental challenges.[^97] The successful rescue of the Arabian oryx from the brink of extinction stands as a concrete achievement in wildlife conservation with global significance.[^98] His understanding that development and environmental stewardship could coexist influenced environmental policy throughout the Gulf region.[^99]

Within Arab and Islamic contexts, Sheikh Zayed is widely admired as a leader who successfully modernized his nation while maintaining cultural identity and Islamic values. Islamic scholars and Arab intellectuals praise his emphasis on education, his respect for traditional consultation methods, and his generous humanitarian assistance to Muslim communities worldwide.[^100] His support for Islamic causes, funding of mosques and Islamic centers globally, and promotion of moderate Islam earned him respect across the Muslim world.[^101] His famous statement that "wealth is not money, wealth lies in men" reflected an understanding that human development, not material accumulation, defines true prosperity.[^102]

Diplomats and foreign policy analysts credit Sheikh Zayed with establishing the UAE as a responsible international actor that punches above its weight in global affairs. His emphasis on dialogue, mediation, and diplomatic solutions to conflicts created a foreign policy tradition that has served the UAE well.[^103] His generosity in providing humanitarian aid and development assistance established the UAE's reputation as a constructive global citizen.[^104] His ability to maintain relationships with diverse actors—Western powers, Arab states, and various Asian and African nations—demonstrated diplomatic flexibility and pragmatism.[^105]

Emirati citizens and many Arabs view Sheikh Zayed with deep affection and gratitude for transforming lives and creating opportunities that previous generations could never have imagined. Personal testimonies from Emiratis who lived through the transformation describe him as genuinely caring about his people's welfare, accessible to ordinary citizens, and committed to ensuring all shared in the nation's prosperity.[^106] His emphasis on Emirati identity and cultural pride helped forge a sense of national belonging that transcends tribal and regional differences.[^107]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars and human rights advocates argue that Sheikh Zayed's political legacy institutionalized authoritarian governance that denies basic democratic rights and political freedoms to UAE residents. Political scientist Kristian Coates Ulrichsen and other critics contend that the ruling bargain Sheikh Zayed established—material prosperity in exchange for political acquiescence—creates an unsustainable model that suppresses human potential and prevents genuine political development.[^108] They argue that the absence of representative institutions, political parties, and free expression creates a democratic deficit that becomes increasingly problematic as the population becomes more educated and globally connected.[^109]

Labor rights advocates and human rights organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented extensive abuses within the kafala system that governs migrant workers—a system consolidated during Sheikh Zayed's rule. Critics argue that the exploitation of millions of foreign workers who built the UAE's infrastructure represents a moral failure that taints the legacy of development.[^110] The vast wealth disparity between citizens and the migrant majority, combined with the absence of pathways to citizenship or permanent residency, creates what critics describe as a "caste system" incompatible with human dignity and justice.[^111]

Feminist scholars and women's rights activists argue that while Sheikh Zayed supported some improvements in women's status, he maintained patriarchal legal structures and social norms that fundamentally limited women's autonomy and equality. Legal discrimination in personal status laws, male guardianship requirements, and structural barriers to women's full participation in public life persisted throughout his rule.[^112] Critics contend that incremental reforms, while welcome, fell far short of gender equality and reflected a paternalistic approach that granted privileges rather than recognizing inherent rights.[^113]

Environmental critics challenge the narrative of Sheikh Zayed as an environmental pioneer, pointing to the UAE's enormous per-capita carbon footprint, massive energy consumption, and environmental degradation associated with rapid urbanization and oil extraction. Scholar Rami Zurayk and other environmental critics argue that tree-planting, while symbolically important, cannot offset the fundamental unsustainability of the UAE's development model based on fossil fuel extraction and resource-intensive consumption.[^114] They contend that genuine environmental leadership requires confronting climate change and transitioning away from oil dependence—steps that remained incomplete during Sheikh Zayed's lifetime.[^115]

Some Arab intellectuals and political activists criticize Sheikh Zayed's foreign policy as too accommodating to Western interests, particularly regarding relationships with the United States and United Kingdom. Critics argue that despite his rhetoric supporting Arab causes, his pragmatic diplomacy sometimes prioritized regime stability and economic interests over solidarity with Arab and Islamic movements challenging Western influence in the region.[^116] His cooperation with British and American strategic interests, particularly during the Cold War era, drew criticism from Arab nationalists and anti-imperialist movements.[^117]

Economic critics question whether oil-funded prosperity represents genuine development or simply resource redistribution that creates dependency rather than productivity. Some economists argue that the rentier state model Sheikh Zayed established—where government distributes oil revenues rather than collecting taxes—creates economic distortions, stifles entrepreneurship, and leaves citizens dependent on government largesse rather than developing productive capabilities.[^118] The relatively small number of Emiratis engaged in productive private sector employment suggests that oil wealth may have created comfortable lifestyles without fostering the economic dynamism necessary for long-term sustainability.[^119]

Regional analysts critical of UAE foreign policy under subsequent leaders argue that more interventionist and assertive positions adopted after Sheikh Zayed's death represent departures from his wisdom and moderation.[^120] Some critics suggest that his centralized power structure and authoritarian governance model enabled the more controversial policies pursued by his successors, raising questions about accountability and institutional constraints on leadership.[^121] These critics view aspects of current UAE foreign policy as betraying Sheikh Zayed's stated principles of dialogue and moderation, though supporters counter that adaptations to changing regional circumstances are necessary and would have earned his approval.[^122]
