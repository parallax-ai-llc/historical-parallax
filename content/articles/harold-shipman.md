## Summary
Harold Frederick Shipman was a British doctor and one of the most prolific serial killers in recorded history. He was convicted of murdering 15 patients but a subsequent inquiry concluded he was responsible for at least 218 deaths over a 23-year period. Shipman used lethal injections of diamorphine (heroin) to kill his mostly elderly patients while serving as their trusted general practitioner.

## Early Life
Harold Shipman was born on January 14, 1946, in Nottingham, England, to a working-class family. He was close to his mother, who died of lung cancer when he was 17 — an event that deeply affected him, particularly watching her receive morphine injections for pain relief. He studied medicine at Leeds School of Medicine and qualified as a doctor in 1970. He joined a group practice in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, but was dismissed in 1975 after forging prescriptions for pethidine for his own use. [^1]

## Criminal Career
After rehabilitating from his drug addiction, Shipman joined the Donneybrook Medical Practice in Hyde, Greater Manchester, in 1977. He later opened his own single-handed practice. Over the next two decades, he systematically murdered patients, primarily elderly women, by administering lethal doses of diamorphine during home visits. He would then falsify medical records to indicate poor health and sign death certificates listing natural causes. The Shipman Inquiry estimated he killed at least 218 patients between 1975 and 1998. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Suspicions arose when Dr. Linda Reynolds of the Brooke Surgery noticed an unusually high death rate among Shipman's patients. The final catalyst was the death of Kathleen Grundy, a healthy 81-year-old former mayoress, in June 1998. Her daughter, solicitor Angela Woodruff, discovered a crudely forged will naming Shipman as beneficiary. Police investigation revealed Grundy had been injected with a lethal dose of morphine. Shipman was arrested on September 7, 1998, and convicted of 15 murders on January 31, 2000. He hanged himself in his cell at Wakefield Prison on January 13, 2004. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Many of his patients who were not victimized remembered him as a caring and attentive doctor [^4]
- His case led to the Shipman Inquiry and comprehensive reforms in death certification procedures in the UK
- Prompted establishment of new monitoring systems for controlled drug prescriptions in medical practice

## Negative Perspectives
- Believed to have murdered at least 218 patients, making him one of the most prolific serial killers in history [^5]
- Exploited the trust inherent in the doctor-patient relationship
- Targeted vulnerable elderly patients, predominantly women living alone
- Forged medical records and death certificates to cover his crimes
- Attempted to forge the will of his final victim for financial gain
- His crimes went undetected for over two decades due to systemic failures
