## Summary

Onisaburo Deguchi was the co-founder and organizer of Oomoto, one of Japan's most dynamic new religious movements. He married Nao Deguchi's daughter and systematized the movement's theology. He was an extraordinarily prolific writer and artist, dictating the 81-volume Reikai Monogatari (Tales from the Spirit World). Oomoto was suppressed twice by the Japanese government (1921 and 1935) for its challenge to State Shinto.
