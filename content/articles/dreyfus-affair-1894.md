## Overview

The Dreyfus Affair was a political scandal that divided the Third French Republic from 1894 until its resolution in 1906. Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a young Jewish artillery officer, was wrongly convicted of treason for allegedly passing military secrets to Germany. He was sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil's Island. It later emerged that the real culprit was Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy, but high-ranking military officials suppressed the new evidence to cover their error, relying on antisemitism and forged documents. The affair split France into "Dreyfusards" (pro-republican, anticlerical, justice) and "Anti-Dreyfusards" (army, church, nationalist). It culminated in Emile Zola's famous open letter *"J'Accuse...!"*.

## The Conviction (1894)

**The Crime:**
French spy in German Embassy found a torn note (*bordereau*) in wastebasket promising secrets.

**The Suspect:**
Handwriting was similar to Dreyfus. He was Jewish (easy scapegoat).
Despite lack of motive (Dreyfus was wealthy), he was arrested.

**Degradation:**
Publicly stripped of rank in courtyard of École Militaire. Crowd shouted "Death to the Jews!"
Sent to Devil's Island (Hellish prison off French Guiana).

## The Discovery (1896)

**Georges Picquart:**
New head of counter-intelligence. Found out that the spy was still active.
Identified real traitor: **Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy** (gambling debts).
Picquart reported this to generals. He was told to stay silent and transferred to Tunisia (silenced).

## J'Accuse...! (1898)

**The Acquittal of Esterhazy:**
Military court acquitted Esterhazy in 2 minutes despite evidence.

**Zola's Letter (Jan 13, 1898):**
Novelist **Émile Zola** published open letter to President on front page of *L'Aurore*.
Headline: **"J'ACCUSE...!"** (I Accuse).
Named specific generals. Accused them of conspiracy.
Zola convicted of libel and fled to England, but he blew the case wide open.

## Resolution

**Retrial (1899):**
Dreyfus brought back. Convicted *again* (10 years) with "extenuating circumstances" (absurd for treason).
President pardoned him.

**Exoneration (1906):**
Supreme Court annulled verdict. Dreyfus reinstated as Major. Received Legion of Honour.

## Legacy

Major turning point in:
- **Zionism:** Theodor Herzl covered trial as journalist. Concluded Jews rarely safe in Europe -> founded modern Zionism.
- **French Secularism:** Discredited Church/Army influence -> 1905 Separation of Church and State.
