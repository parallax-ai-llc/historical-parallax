## Summary

Aidan of Lindisfarne was an Irish monk from Iona who became the apostle of Northumbria and the founder of the Lindisfarne monastery. He was invited by King Oswald of Northumbria to evangelize the north of England. His gentle, pastoral approach — traveling on foot, teaching, and serving the poor — was enormously effective. Lindisfarne became one of the most important centers of Celtic Christianity and produced the Lindisfarne Gospels.
