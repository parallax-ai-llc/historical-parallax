## Overview

The Battle of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg) was the final and bloodiest major battle of the Pacific War. Fought from April 1 to June 22, 1945, it was the "dress rehearsal" for the invasion of mainland Japan. The Japanese, knowing they could not win, aimed to make the battle so bloody ("The Typhoon of Steel") that the Americans would sue for peace rather than invade Tokyo. They succeeded in the bloodiness: Kamikazes sank 36 US ships, and charging infantry inflicted 50,000 US casualties. The Japanese defending army eventually collapsed, but not before 100,000 civilians—caught in the crossfire or forced to commit suicide—perished.

## The Civilian Tragedy

Okinawa was a prefecture of Japan (home territory), unlike Iwo Jima.
**Population:** ~300,000.
**Propaganda:** Japanese army told civilians Americans would rape, torture, and eat them.
**Suicide Cliffs:** Thousands jumped off cliffs (Marpi Point) or blew themselves up with grenades given by soldiers.
**Result:** ~100,000 to 150,000 civilians died (1/3 of population).

## Strategic Consequence

**Decision:** Drop the Atomic Bombs on Hiroshima/Nagasaki to force surrender without invasion.
