## Summary

Harvey Alter is an American virologist who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of the Hepatitis C virus. His systematic studies of transfusion-associated hepatitis led to the identification of a new virus distinct from Hepatitis A and B. This discovery eventually led to blood screening tests and antiviral treatments that have saved millions of lives.
