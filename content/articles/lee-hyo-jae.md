## Summary

Lee Hyo-jae (이효재, November 4, 1924 – October 4, 2020) was a pioneering South Korean sociologist, feminist scholar, and social activist who dedicated her life to advancing women's rights and democracy in South Korea.[^1] She founded the sociology department at Ewha Womans University in 1958 and established South Korea's first women's studies program in 1977, training generations of feminist leaders.[^2] Her activism spanned four decades and encompassed campaigns to abolish patriarchal family laws, advocate for comfort women survivors, challenge military dictatorships, and promote gender equality in employment and politics.[^3] President Moon Jae-in described her as "the pioneer of Korean women's movement," noting she "played an enormous role in democracy and social movement."[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Lee Hyo-jae was born on November 4, 1924, in Masan, a precinct of Changwon in Gyeongsang Province, during the Japanese occupation of Korea.[^5] Her father, Lee Yak-shin, was a Presbyterian minister and church leader, while her mother, Lee Oak-kyung, founded and ran an orphanage.[^6] This religious and socially-conscious upbringing profoundly influenced her later dedication to women's rights and social justice.

When Lee was a young woman, her parents brought her to Seoul for an arranged marriage.[^7] In a defining act of independence that would characterize her entire life, she ran away, believing that marriage would interfere with her ambitions.[^8] She never married, choosing instead to dedicate her life to scholarship and activism.[^9]

In 1945, Lee's life took a transformative turn when an American serviceman named Jobe Couch, attached to the U.S. Embassy in Korea, became impressed by Lee's younger sister Hyo-suk and offered to take her to the United States for a college education.[^10] However, the sister refused to go without Lee, so Couch agreed to bring both sisters to America.[^11] Couch enlisted the help of Alabama Congressman Carl Elliott to obtain visas and lobby the University of Alabama to accept the sisters on full scholarships, despite the fact they did not speak English.[^12]

Lee Hyo-jae earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Alabama and subsequently obtained a master's degree in sociology from Columbia University.[^13] During her studies in the United States through the 1940s and 1950s, she was exposed to Western feminist thought and sociological theories that would shape her groundbreaking work upon returning to Korea.[^14]

---

## Rise to Academic Prominence

Lee Hyo-jae returned to South Korea in 1957 with a mission to modernize Korean sociology and introduce feminist perspectives to academic discourse.[^15] In 1958, she helped found the department of sociology at Ewha Womans University, one of South Korea's most prestigious women's universities.[^16] This position gave her a platform to influence generations of young women and develop theoretical frameworks for understanding gender inequality in Korean society.

As a professor at Ewha, Lee quickly established herself as an innovative thinker who challenged traditional academic boundaries.[^17] Her teaching integrated sociological analysis with feminist theory, providing students with tools to critically examine the patriarchal structures that governed Korean society. Her reputation grew not only as a rigorous scholar but also as a mentor who encouraged her students to become activists and change-makers.[^18]

In 1977, Lee took a momentous step by establishing the first course on women's studies at Ewha Womans University—the first such course in all of Korea.[^19] This pioneering program examined the social, economic, and political status of women through an academic lens, legitimizing feminist scholarship in a country where such perspectives had been marginalized. The course grew rapidly in popularity and influence, leading to the establishment of South Korea's first graduate-level women's studies program in 1981.[^20]

Many of Lee's students became leading feminists who rose to key positions in liberal governments, creating a powerful network of feminist leaders across South Korean society.[^21] Her academic work included formulating theories in Korean women's studies and publishing extensively on gender inequality, family structures, and women's labor.[^22] At her death, she was a professor emeritus of sociology at Ewha Womans University, having inspired generations of young women over more than four decades.[^23]

## Major Achievements

### Challenging Patriarchal Family Law

Lee Hyo-jae was at the vanguard of nearly every major movement to enhance women's rights in Korea for four decades from 1958 to 1997.[^24] Her campaigns advocated for the reexamination of patriarchal customs in South Korea, including male-headed household registration systems and discrimination against women in property inheritance.[^25]

One of her most significant achievements was advocating for the abolition of the hoju system—a patriarchal household registration system where all family members were registered under a male head of household.[^26] Opponents, including Lee, considered this system innately patriarchal and a violation of the right to gender equality. Her persistent advocacy contributed to the Constitutional Court's 2005 decision that the hoju system was incompatible with constitutional guarantees of equality.[^27] The system was finally replaced by the modern Family Relations Register through a reform of the Civil Code in 2008.[^28]

Lee also pioneered the movement to use two surnames to represent the heritage of both mother and father, successfully advocating for the abolishment of South Korea's patriarchal naming system that only recognized paternal lineage.[^29] This reform allowed people to use both parents' surnames, acknowledging women's contributions to family heritage.[^30]

### Economic and Political Gender Equality

Lee pushed vigorously for gender quotas in employment and advocated for wage equality between men and women.[^31] She helped establish a rule that required half of the candidates for proportional representation seats in South Korea's National Assembly to be women, though full implementation of this quota system has remained incomplete.[^32] Her work laid the groundwork for future gender equity legislation in South Korean politics and workplaces.

### Comfort Women Advocacy

When Lee learned of a university colleague's research into Korean comfort women—women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War II—she came to view this government-sanctioned enslavement as one of history's most brutal war crimes.[^33] She spent the next two decades fighting to bring attention to the issue and to secure redress from Japan.[^34]

Lee co-founded the Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan in November 1990, alongside Yun Chung-ok, serving as co-chairwoman.[^35] She worked on the staff of the Korean Council during its first ten years and was instrumental in bringing comfort woman survivor Kim Hak-soon to public attention.[^36] Kim's historic testimony on August 14, 1991, was the first public testimony by a Korean comfort woman, breaking decades of silence and opening the door for other survivors to come forward.[^37]

Lee's activism helped pressure the Japanese government, which had long denied involvement, to acknowledge its role in the comfort women system in 1992.[^38] South Korea and Japan reached a settlement in 2015 that involved a Japanese apology and $8.3 million for surviving women, though this agreement remained controversial among activists and survivors.[^39]

### Peace Activism

In 2015, at age 90, Lee participated in a groundbreaking peace initiative.[^40] She was among a group of 30 female activists, including Gloria Steinem and Nobel Peace laureates Leymah Gbowee and Mairead Corrigan-Maguire, who crossed the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea to promote disarmament and peace between the two countries.[^41] This rare crossing received international attention and demonstrated Lee's commitment to peace advocacy even in her final years.[^42]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Firing Under Military Dictatorship

Lee Hyo-jae's commitment to democracy brought her into direct conflict with South Korea's authoritarian rulers. In 1980, when General Chun Doo-hwan seized power through a military coup, Lee took a public stance against the dictatorship.[^43] She was among the pro-democracy intellectuals wanted by the Chun Doo-hwan regime for supporting opposition politician Kim Dae-jung.[^44] As a result, she was fired from her post at Ewha Womans University in 1980.[^45]

This persecution occurred in the wake of the brutal suppression of the Gwangju Uprising in May 1980, where government forces massacred hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators.[^46] Lee's support for Kim Dae-jung—who was arrested on charges of instigating protests and would later become South Korea's first opposition president in 1997—marked her as a threat to the military regime.[^47]

### Principled Rejection of State Honors

In a remarkable demonstration of her principles, Lee declined a national medal in 1996 because the same medal was being given to someone whom she believed to be a government agent planted in the women's movement.[^48] This refusal illustrated her unwillingness to accept state recognition when she believed it compromised the integrity of feminist activism or served to legitimize government surveillance of social movements.

### Debates Within Feminist Movements

While Lee was universally respected as a pioneer, her work occasionally intersected with complex debates within feminist movements about nationalism, state cooperation, and strategic priorities. Her role in comfort women advocacy, for instance, operated within broader tensions about how to balance feminist solidarity with nationalist narratives and whether to engage with state-mediated solutions like the 2015 Japan-Korea agreement.[^49]

---

## Personal Life

Lee Hyo-jae never married, having run away from an arranged marriage in her youth.[^50] This decision was extraordinary for a woman of her generation in Korea, where marriage was considered virtually obligatory and unmarried women faced significant social stigma. Her choice to remain single allowed her to dedicate herself fully to academic work and activism without the constraints of traditional domestic roles.

Lee was deeply close to her younger sister Hyo-suk, with whom she traveled to America in 1945.[^51] The sisters' bond was so strong that Hyo-suk refused the opportunity to study in the United States unless her older sister could come as well.[^52] This family loyalty characterized Lee's personal relationships throughout her life.

By all accounts, Lee possessed a formidable intellect combined with deep compassion for the marginalized. Her students remembered her as both rigorous and nurturing, demanding excellence while providing unwavering support.[^53] She inspired loyalty and dedication among her followers, many of whom became leaders in their own right.

Lee's personality combined scholarly discipline with activist passion. She was known for her courage in confronting authority, as demonstrated by her public opposition to military dictatorship despite personal consequences.[^54] At the same time, she possessed the patience and strategic thinking necessary to build institutions like academic programs and advocacy organizations that would outlast her own lifetime.

Throughout her 95 years, Lee maintained her commitment to social justice and women's empowerment. Even in her final years, she participated in peace activism, crossing the DMZ at age 90 in an act that captured international attention.[^55]

## Legacy

Lee Hyo-jae died on October 4, 2020, from sepsis at a hospital in Changwon, South Korea, at the age of 95.[^56] Her death prompted widespread tributes from across Korean society, reflecting the enormous impact she had on the nation's development.

Democratic Party Chairman Lee Nak-yeon stated: "It is not at all an exaggeration to say every woman who lives today owes a debt to Lee Hyo-jae."[^57] President Moon Jae-in issued a statement describing her as "the pioneer of Korean women's movement and played an enormous role in democracy and social movement," adding, "She was among the big stars, in those dark days when the stars shone so brightly."[^58] He posthumously awarded her a national medal, though notably she had declined such honors in the past.[^59]

Lee's legacy is visible in multiple dimensions of Korean society. The women's studies programs she pioneered have multiplied across South Korean universities, producing thousands of scholars and activists.[^60] The legal reforms she championed—from family law changes to gender quotas—have fundamentally altered the status of women in Korean society, even as struggles for full equality continue.[^61]

Her students formed a powerful network of feminist leaders who occupied important positions in liberal governments, media, academia, and civil society organizations.[^62] This multigenerational impact ensured that Lee's vision for gender equality would continue to shape Korean society long after her death.

The comfort women issue, which Lee helped bring to international attention, remains a significant historical memory in Korea and a continued point of tension with Japan.[^63] August 14 is now commemorated as International Comfort Women Memorial Day, memorializing the date when Kim Hak-soon gave her historic testimony—testimony that Lee helped facilitate.[^64]

A biography described Lee's comprehensive impact: "Among women who are living today, there is not a single person who doesn't owe Lee Hyo-jae."[^65] This assessment reflects how her work touched virtually every aspect of women's lives in modern Korea, from family law to political representation, from academic opportunity to historical memory.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and activists across generations have recognized Lee Hyo-jae as one of the most important figures in modern Korean history. Her pioneering establishment of women's studies programs legitimized feminist scholarship and created institutional infrastructure for gender research that continues to produce knowledge and train activists.[^66]

Lee's role in challenging patriarchal family law is viewed as foundational to the advancement of women's legal status in South Korea. The abolition of the hoju system, which Lee fought for over decades, represented a fundamental shift in how Korean society conceptualized family, gender, and citizenship.[^67] Legal scholars credit her persistent advocacy with creating the political will necessary for this transformation.

Her comfort women activism is celebrated for breaking the silence surrounding one of the twentieth century's most systematic violations of women's rights. By helping survivors tell their stories and demanding accountability from the Japanese government, Lee contributed to global awareness of wartime sexual violence and inspired similar movements for historical justice worldwide.[^68]

Democracy advocates honor Lee's courage in opposing military dictatorship at personal cost. Her firing in 1980 and her status as a wanted intellectual under the Chun regime demonstrated that she was willing to sacrifice career security for principle.[^69] This moral courage inspired other intellectuals and activists during Korea's democratization movement.

The Korea Herald published a tribute titled "Legacy of a pioneer feminist thinker and activist," reflecting scholarly recognition of her theoretical contributions alongside her practical activism.[^70] Lee's work demonstrated that rigorous academic analysis and grassroots organizing could reinforce each other, creating lasting social change.

### Negative Views

While Lee is overwhelmingly celebrated, some conservative voices in South Korea have criticized feminist activists like her for allegedly importing Western ideologies incompatible with Korean values. Critics argued that challenges to traditional family structures threatened social cohesion and disrespected Korean cultural heritage.[^71]

The recent backlash against feminism in South Korea, particularly strong among young men, has created a political environment where feminist pioneers like Lee face posthumous criticism from anti-feminist movements.[^72] Some conservative politicians and commentators have characterized the feminist movement she helped build as divisive and blamed it for social tensions, though these criticisms typically target contemporary feminism rather than Lee specifically.[^73]

Debates within feminist movements have occasionally questioned strategic choices made by Lee's generation of activists. Some younger feminists have critiqued the comfort women movement's emphasis on nationalist narratives over transnational feminist solidarity, or questioned whether state-mediated solutions like the 2015 Japan-Korea agreement served survivors' interests.[^74] However, these critiques generally acknowledge Lee's crucial role while debating strategic directions.

Her decision to work within institutional frameworks—academia, government consultation, established women's organizations—has been questioned by more radical feminists who prefer grassroots, anti-institutional approaches. Yet most acknowledge that Lee's institutional work created essential infrastructure for feminist movements.[^75]
