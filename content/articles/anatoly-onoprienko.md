## Summary
Anatoly Onoprienko, 'The Beast of Ukraine,' murdered 52 people between 1989 and 1996. He attacked isolated rural homes, killing entire families and burning the houses. He was convicted in 1999 and died in prison in 2013.

## Early Life
Born July 25, 1959, in Lasky, Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine. His mother died when he was four, and he was placed in an orphanage while his brother remained with their father. This rejection profoundly affected him. He drifted through various jobs. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1989 and 1996, Onoprienko murdered 52 people across western Ukraine. He would break into isolated rural homes at night, shooting inhabitants and then burning the houses. He sometimes killed witnesses on nearby roads. He operated in pairs initially, later alone. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
The 'Terminator,' as media called him, was arrested on April 16, 1996, at a relative's apartment after a tip. He confessed to all 52 murders. Convicted and sentenced to life in 1999 (Ukraine had abolished the death penalty). He died in prison on August 27, 2013. [^3]
