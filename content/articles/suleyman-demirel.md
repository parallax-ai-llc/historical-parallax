## Summary

Süleyman Demirel was one of Turkey's most dominant political figures of the 20th century, serving as prime minister seven times between 1965 and 1993, and as the ninth president from 1993 to 2000. A civil engineer by training, he earned the moniker "King of Dams" for his extensive infrastructure projects before entering politics. His political career spanned decades of Turkish turbulence, surviving two military coups and a decade-long political ban, yet always managing to return to power. With over 10 years as premier, his tenure ranks as the third longest in Turkish history, behind only İsmet İnönü and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Sami Süleyman Gündoğdu Demirel was born on November 1, 1924, in İslamköy, a small village in the Atabey district of Isparta Province in southwestern Turkey. He was born to Hacı Yahya Demirel (1894–1972) and Hacı Ümmühan Demirel (1902–1979), a family of peasant farmers.[^3] As a child, Demirel worked as a shepherd, tending his family's livestock in the rural Anatolian countryside—an experience that would later become central to his political identity as a "man of the people."[^4]

Unlike the traditional Turkish political elite who typically emerged from military-bureaucratic circles or landowning families, Demirel's humble village origins set him apart and became a powerful element of his public image throughout his career.[^5] He attended elementary school in his hometown before moving to attend middle and high schools in Isparta, Muğla, and Afyon.[^6] Demonstrating academic aptitude from an early age, Demirel pursued higher education at the prestigious Istanbul Technical University, where he studied civil engineering—a field that would define the first phase of his professional life.[^7]

In 1948, while still completing his studies, Demirel married Nazmiye Şener, his second cousin, in what would become a 65-year marriage.[^8] He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of Istanbul Technical University in February 1949, at age 25, launching a career that would take him from engineering projects to the highest offices in Turkey.[^9] His village background, combined with his technical expertise, created a unique profile that resonated with both rural and modernizing constituencies in Turkish society.

## Rise to Power

Upon graduation in 1949, Demirel immediately began working for the Electric Works Study Administration (EIEI), where he quickly distinguished himself as a talented engineer.[^10] His expertise in hydraulic engineering and dam construction earned him opportunities for advanced study abroad. Between 1949 and 1950, and again from 1954 to 1955, Demirel traveled to the United States to study irrigation, electrical technologies, and dam construction.[^11] During his 1949 visit, the 25-year-old Demirel was placed in the Nevada Desert with a crew building the Hoover Dam, an experience that profoundly influenced his vision for Turkey's infrastructure development.[^12] In 1954, Eisenhower Fellowships selected him to represent Turkey, further cementing his international credentials.[^13]

Demirel's engineering career advanced rapidly. During the construction of the Seyhan Dam, he worked as a project engineer, and in 1954 was appointed head of the Department of Dams at the State Hydraulic Works (DSI).[^14] Just one year later, in 1955, at the remarkably young age of 31, he was appointed director general of the DSI, where he supervised the development of numerous dams, power plants, and irrigation systems aimed at flood control, hydropower generation, and agricultural expansion across Turkey.[^15] This role established his reputation as an expert in water resource management and earned him the moniker "Chief Engineer" and later "King of Dams."[^16] Over 600 dams were built under his engineering influence by the 1990s.[^17]

After the military coup d'état of 1960, Demirel was drafted into the Turkish Army for compulsory military service.[^18] Between 1960 and 1962, he worked as an independent consultant and engineer, and also taught at the Middle East Technical University (ODTÜ).[^19] His transition from engineering to politics began in 1962 when he joined the General Administrative Committee of the Justice Party (AP), a center-right party that positioned itself as the successor to the banned Democrat Party.[^20]

The turning point came in 1964 when Demirel was elected Chairman of the Justice Party on November 28, following the death of its previous leader Ragıp Gümüşpala.[^21] Between February and October 1965, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and State Minister in a caretaker coalition government.[^22] The October 1965 general election proved to be Demirel's breakthrough moment. His Justice Party won an unprecedented 53% of the vote and secured 240 seats out of 450 in the Grand National Assembly, ending years of fragile coalition governments.[^23] On October 27, 1965, Süleyman Demirel became Turkey's youngest prime minister at age 40, launching a political career that would span nearly three decades.[^24]

## Major Achievements

Süleyman Demirel's achievements as prime minister and president were substantial and wide-ranging, touching infrastructure, economics, social policy, and foreign relations. His engineering background profoundly shaped his governance philosophy, which prioritized tangible development projects and economic growth.

### Infrastructure Development and Modernization

Demirel's most visible legacy lies in Turkey's infrastructure transformation. He oversaw the construction of major projects during his time as Prime Minister, including the Keban Dam, the Bosphorus Bridge, and an oil pipeline.[^25] Construction of the first Bosphorus Bridge started in February 1970, with ceremonies attended by President Cevdet Sunay and Prime Minister Süleyman Demirel.[^26] As a civil engineer-turned-Prime Minister, Demirel had signed an agreement with British firm Freeman, Fox and Partners in 1968 to build the intercontinental bridge connecting Ortaköy to Beylerbeyi.[^27] When the bridge finally opened on October 30, 1973—one day after the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey—it was hailed as a modern marvel and the zenith of Turkey's Cold War-era modernization project.[^28] At the time of completion, it had the fourth-longest suspension bridge span in the world.[^29]

Beyond the iconic Bosphorus Bridge, Demirel undertook massive industrialization projects, including the İskenderun steel mill, Seydişehir aluminum mill, and Petkim petrochemical complex.[^30] Under his leadership, Turkey's motorway network expanded significantly, and electricity generation and transmission grids were built across the country.[^31] His Justice Party campaigned in the 1970s under the promise of "water and roads," with political advertisements featuring the party's white horse symbol over depictions of the Bosphorus Bridge.[^32]

Perhaps his most ambitious initiative was the Southeast Anatolian Project (GAP), one of the largest water-related development projects in the world.[^33] At the heart of this strategic development was the ultimate goal of constructing twenty-two dams and nineteen hydropower plants in southeastern Turkey.[^34] Demirel saw industrialization as the key to generating prosperity for larger segments of society, which he believed would eventually become the backbone of a democratic regime.[^35]

### Economic Growth and Development

Under Demirel's governance in the 1960s, Turkey experienced impressive economic growth. The yearly inflation rate averaged approximately 5 percent while economic growth was about 7 percent during his term—figures that represented significant prosperity and stability for the era.[^36] His emphasis on infrastructure development, industrial expansion, and rural development created jobs and improved living standards for many Turks, particularly in previously underdeveloped regions.

### Social and Political Reforms

During his final term as Prime Minister and his presidency, Demirel implemented several important social and political reforms. He acknowledged the distinction of Kurds being a different ethnicity from Turks—a groundbreaking recognition in Turkish politics.[^37] In 1992, during a visit to Diyarbakır, Demirel used the phrase "We recognize Kurdish reality," which had massive symbolic meaning as it indicated the end of the policy of denial of the physical existence of Kurds.[^38] He declared that "Turkey's border, flag, and official language cannot be debated, but ethnic groups' demand to retain their own ethnic identity and culture should not be rejected … They have their own history, language, and folklore."[^39]

His government reformed criminal procedure law, removed the ban on all party names and abbreviations accumulated from previous military coups, and ratified international conventions on trade union freedoms.[^40] The "Green Card" social security program was established during his administration, and the age requirement for retirement was abolished.[^41] These reforms represented significant steps toward democratization and social welfare expansion in Turkey.

### Foreign Policy Achievements

Though a pro-Western-oriented politician, Demirel was aware of Turkey's necessity to pursue a more autonomous foreign policy without abandoning the West.[^42] In the 1990s, as President, he built the foundation of Turkish-Israeli ties, including the Turkey-Israel Free Trade Agreement.[^43] He also participated in international peace efforts, serving in 2001 as a member of the committee that drafted the Mitchell Report on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.[^44]

### Political Longevity and Democratic Resilience

With 10 years and 5 months as premier, Demirel's tenure ranks as the third longest in Turkish history.[^45] He formed more governments than any other Turkish politician and served as the longest-serving prime minister in modern Turkish political history, a testament to his political adaptability and popular appeal.[^46] His ability to return to power repeatedly after setbacks, including two military coups and a decade-long political ban, demonstrated remarkable political resilience and mastery of Turkey's complex political landscape.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Süleyman Demirel's political career was marked by substantial controversies and criticisms that tarnished his legacy in the eyes of many observers.

### Political Violence and the 1970s Crisis

Perhaps the most serious criticism leveled against Demirel concerns the political violence that engulfed Turkey during his governments in the 1970s. Many blamed Demirel for turning a blind eye to his nationalist coalition partners, who openly incited violence that saw dozens killed weekly in clashes between left- and right-wing gangs.[^47] Critics, including leftist opposition parties, contended that Demirel's alignment with nationalists fueled asymmetrical retaliation rather than impartial enforcement, with security forces disproportionately targeting left-wing suspects while rightist violence received de facto impunity.[^48] This period of chaos and bloodshed ultimately created the conditions that enabled and arguably justified the 1980 military coup.

### Relationship with the Military and Coups

Demirel's relationship with Turkey's powerful military establishment was complex and controversial. He was forced to resign in the 1971 coup, which became known as the "coup by memorandum" when the army presented him with a written ultimatum rather than sending tanks onto the streets.[^49] When he refused to allow the military to assume a policy-making role in efforts to combat terrorism, Turkey's military commanders forced him to resign in March 1971.[^50] 

The coup of September 12, 1980—the third in the history of the Turkish republic—saw Demirel's government overthrown, and he was subsequently hit with a ban from all political activity and sent into temporary internal exile at a military camp.[^51] He was banned from involvement in active politics for 10 years.[^52]

Most controversially, Demirel's role in the 1997 "Postmodern Coup" remains hotly debated. Some accused him of leading the effort to bring down Necmettin Erbakan's REFAHYOL government in collusion with military generals, while others claimed that he prevented a complete military takeover by easing the tension.[^53] Critics accused him of not supporting the democratically elected government against the military during the February 28 Military Memorandum—also known as the "Post-modern coup"—when generals forced Erbakan to sign critical decisions at a National Security Council meeting.[^54] This stance led to accusations that he had betrayed the historical mission of Turkish conservatism by allying himself with the nationalist-secularist military-bureaucratic establishment.[^55]

### Corruption and Patronage

Throughout his political career, critics argued that Demirel symbolized a culture in which power came before principles and helped entrench patronage and corruption in Turkish politics.[^56] They point to a notorious "family photograph," which pictured Demirel surrounded by relatives and associates from the business world—some of whom were later jailed for corruption.[^57] Critics, including economists and reformist analysts, argued that such patronage networks prioritized short-term electoral gains over fiscal discipline, fostering inefficiency and vulnerability that contributed to economic crises and ultimately military interventions.[^58]

While Demirel faced accusations of involvement in corruption throughout his political career, he consistently denied these claims and was never personally convicted of any corruption charges.[^59]

### Political Opportunism

Critics frequently accused Demirel of being a political chameleon, willing to make common cause with disparate political forces—from the far right to Islamists led by Necmettin Erbakan, the father of political Islam in Turkey.[^60] This pragmatic approach to coalition-building, while politically effective, led many to question his ideological consistency and principles.

### Sivas Massacre Response

President Demirel faced criticism for his comments following the Sivas Massacre, in which 35 intellectuals and artists were killed when a hotel was set on fire by an Islamist mob in 1993.[^61] His response was seen by some as insufficiently strong and failing to adequately condemn religious extremism.

### Limitations of Kurdish Reforms

While Demirel is credited with recognizing "Kurdish reality," his actual policy achievements in this area were limited. When he ruled out granting full autonomy to Turkey's Kurdish population, his decision marked another crushing blow to this long-suffering minority.[^62] Though Demirel came to power in October 1991 promising a compassionate policy toward Turkey's Kurds, the escalating Kurdish insurgency ultimately led to a shift toward military solutions rather than meaningful political reforms.[^63] The gap between his rhetoric and actual policy implementation disappointed many who hoped for genuine resolution of Turkey's Kurdish question.

## Personal Life

Süleyman Demirel's personal life was marked by stability, simplicity, and a long marriage that contrasted with the turbulence of his political career. In 1948, at age 24, he married Nazmiye Şener, his second cousin, while still completing his engineering studies.[^64] Their marriage would last 65 years until Nazmiye's death in 2013.[^65] The couple did not have any children, living together in Ankara throughout Demirel's long political career.[^66]

Nazmiye Demirel died on May 27, 2013, in a hospital where she had been receiving treatment for Alzheimer's disease.[^67] Her death came just two years before Süleyman's own passing, and she was later buried in the mausoleum in Demirel's hometown, where he would eventually join her.[^68]

Demirel was known for several distinctive personal characteristics that became part of his public image. His fedora hat became a famous trademark, appearing in countless photographs and political cartoons throughout his career.[^69] He was renowned as a powerful orator with a unique way with words, producing many memorable quotes and aphorisms that entered Turkish political discourse.[^70] His village background and childhood as a shepherd remained central to his self-presentation, allowing him to maintain an image as a "man of the people" despite decades in the highest offices of state.[^71]

Colleagues and observers noted Demirel's sense of humor, his talent for efficient oratory, and his passion for industrialization and infrastructure projects—characteristics that stemmed from his engineering background.[^72] Unlike many Turkish politicians who came from military, bureaucratic, or aristocratic backgrounds, Demirel's peasant origins and technical education gave him a distinctive profile that resonated with both rural and modernizing urban constituencies.

Throughout his career, Demirel maintained strong ties to his native Isparta Province, and his connection to his rural roots remained a source of political strength. His ability to bridge the gap between traditional rural Turkey and modernizing urban centers was one of his key political assets.

## Legacy

Süleyman Demirel's legacy in Turkish political history is complex and multifaceted, combining genuine achievements in infrastructure and economic development with controversies over his role during periods of political violence and military intervention.

### Political Legacy and Longevity

Demirel is remembered as one of the most dominant figures of Turkish political life, owing to his survival skills, sense of humor, talent for efficient oratory, passion for industrialization, and his sponsorship of immense infrastructure projects.[^73] His political longevity is remarkable: with 10 years and 5 months as premier, his tenure ranks as the third longest in Turkish history, after İsmet İnönü and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.[^74] He formed more governments than any other politician in Turkish history and served as the youngest prime minister at age 41.[^75]

His ability to survive two military coups and a decade-long political ban, yet still return to serve as president, demonstrates exceptional political adaptability and resilience.[^76] After the 1980 coup banned him from politics, Demirel launched a successful campaign in 1986 for the lifting of pre-1980 politicians' political bans and initiated a referendum on the issue.[^77] Only 18 days after his political ban was rescinded, he was elected chairman at the extraordinary convention of the True Path Party (DYP).[^78]

### Infrastructure and Development Legacy

Demirel's most tangible legacy lies in Turkey's physical infrastructure. The dams, bridges, highways, power plants, and industrial facilities built under his leadership transformed Turkey's landscape and economy. The Bosphorus Bridge remains an iconic symbol of Turkey's modernization, connecting Europe and Asia and serving as a daily reminder of Demirel's development vision.[^79] The Southeast Anatolia Project (GAP), though controversial for its environmental and social impacts, represents one of the world's most ambitious regional development initiatives.[^80]

Multiple institutions bear his name today, including Süleyman Demirel University in Isparta, numerous high schools across the country, and Süleyman Demirel Airport in Isparta.[^81] In 2019, the Süleyman Demirel Mausoleum was completed and opened to visitors in his hometown, where both he and his wife Nazmiye are buried.[^82]

### Economic Impact

Under Demirel's governance, Turkey experienced significant economic growth in the 1960s, with yearly inflation averaging 5 percent while growth reached about 7 percent.[^83] His emphasis on industrialization was driven by the belief that it was key to generating prosperity for larger segments of society, which would eventually become the backbone of a democratic regime.[^84] The industrial facilities he championed—including the İskenderun steel mill, Seydişehir aluminum mill, and Petkim petrochemical complex—created thousands of jobs and contributed to Turkey's industrial capacity for decades.[^85]

### Foreign Policy Contributions

Though a pro-Western politician, Demirel was aware of Turkey's need to pursue a more autonomous foreign policy without abandoning the West.[^86] His work in the 1990s building the foundation of Turkish-Israeli ties, including the Turkey-Israel Free Trade Agreement, established important regional relationships.[^87] His participation in the 2001 Mitchell Report committee on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict demonstrated his continued engagement in international affairs even after leaving office.[^88]

### Symbolic Significance

Demirel's childhood as a shepherd set him apart from the traditional political elite of Turkey, who usually came from the military-bureaucratic or landowning classes.[^89] This background became a powerful symbol that he used effectively for his public image throughout his career, representing the possibility of upward mobility in Republican Turkey and the integration of rural Anatolia into the modern Turkish state.

### Critical Assessment

A more critical assessment notes Demirel's evolution from conservatism to secularism and accuses him of having betrayed the historical mission of Turkish conservatism by allying himself with the nationalist-secularist military-bureaucratic establishment.[^90] Critics argue that Demirel abandoned the center-right's historical mission in 1997, when as president he was instrumental in bringing down an Islamist-led coalition government in collusion with the General Staff.[^91] As a typical representative of the modernizing Turkish state elite, Demirel has been characterized as primarily preoccupied with safeguarding the pre-eminence of the state and shoring up the legitimacy of the state elite.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Süleyman Demirel emphasize his role as a transformative modernizer who brought infrastructure development and economic growth to Turkey. Scholars and political analysts who view him favorably point to his remarkable political survival skills and his ability to navigate Turkey's turbulent political landscape for over three decades. The Washington Institute's memorial statement upon his death in 2015 praised his contributions to Turkish-American relations and his role as a stabilizing force in Turkish politics.[^93]

Demirel is credited with genuine efforts at democratization, particularly his recognition of "Kurdish reality" in the 1990s, which represented a significant departure from the traditional Turkish state policy of denial.[^94] His statement "We recognize Kurdish reality" in Diyarbakır in 1992 is seen by some historians as a courageous acknowledgment that helped pave the way for later discussions of minority rights in Turkey.[^95]

His defenders argue that his pragmatic approach to coalition-building and his willingness to work with diverse political forces—from nationalists to Islamists—represented democratic flexibility rather than opportunism. They note that he consistently returned to power through democratic elections, suggesting genuine popular support for his leadership. His infrastructure projects, particularly the hundreds of dams built under his influence, brought electricity, irrigation, and economic development to previously neglected rural areas.[^96]

Admirers also highlight his role in preventing complete military takeovers on several occasions, arguing that his political skill helped preserve elements of democratic governance even during Turkey's most turbulent periods. His longevity in office—the third longest premiership in Turkish history—is seen as evidence of political competence and public trust.[^97]

The Daily Sabah's portrait of Demirel emphasizes his "dream for a 'Great Turkey'" and his vision of transforming the country through industrialization and modernization.[^98] This perspective views him as a nation-builder who understood that economic development and infrastructure were prerequisites for a strong, independent Turkey.

### Negative Views

Critics of Demirel present a far less flattering assessment, characterizing him as an opportunistic politician who prioritized power over principles and enabled some of Turkey's darkest periods. Left-wing intellectuals and historians particularly criticize his role during the political violence of the 1970s, when his governments allegedly turned a blind eye to right-wing violence while security forces cracked down disproportionately on leftists.[^99] This asymmetrical approach to political violence, critics argue, contributed directly to the chaos that precipitated the brutal 1980 military coup.

Scholars critical of Demirel's legacy point to his role in entrenching patronage and corruption in Turkish politics. The notorious "family photograph" showing Demirel surrounded by business associates—some later convicted of corruption—is cited as emblematic of a political culture that valued personal loyalty and business connections over merit and transparency.[^100] Economists and reformist analysts argue that such networks prioritized short-term electoral gains over fiscal discipline, creating structural weaknesses in Turkey's economy.[^101]

His relationship with the military establishment draws particular criticism. While he was removed by coups in 1971 and 1980, his role in the 1997 "Postmodern Coup" against the Islamist-led government of Necmettin Erbakan suggests a willingness to collaborate with military intervention when it suited his interests.[^102] Turkish Analyst's article "Süleyman Demirel's Odyssey From Conservatism to Secularism" argues that he betrayed the historical mission of Turkish conservatism by ultimately siding with the secular military-bureaucratic establishment against elected Islamist politicians.[^103]

Critics also note the gap between Demirel's rhetoric on Kurdish rights and his actual policies. While he recognized "Kurdish reality" in words, his government ultimately ruled out meaningful autonomy for Kurdish regions and increasingly relied on military solutions to the Kurdish insurgency.[^104] This disconnect between progressive rhetoric and regressive policy implementation is seen as characteristic of Demirel's political style.

Environmental and human rights critics point to the massive dam projects, particularly GAP, as causing displacement of communities, destruction of archaeological sites, and environmental damage.[^105] The prioritization of development over environmental and cultural preservation is seen as reflecting a narrow, engineering-focused vision of progress.

Middle East Eye's obituary noted that while Demirel survived two coups, his survival came at the cost of accommodation with military power rather than principled resistance.[^106] This perspective suggests that his political longevity reflected adaptability to authoritarian pressures rather than democratic heroism.
