## Overview

The DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was a revolutionary venture capital fund run by code, not people. It raised $150 million in Ether (crowdfunding record).
**The Hack:**
On June 17, 2016, a hacker exploited a "recursive call bug" in the smart contract.
The hacker drained 3.6 million ETH (worth $50m then, billions today) into a "Child DAO."
**The Hacker's Letter:**
The hacker seemingly posted an open letter claiming the action was legal: *"I have made use of this feature... 'Code is Law'."*

## The Hard Fork

The Ethereum community faced an existential crisis.
**Option 1:** Do nothing. "Code is Law." The hacker keeps the money. (This became Ethereum Classic / ETC).
**Option 2:** Rewrite history. Create a "Hard Fork" to return the stolen funds. (This became Ethereum / ETH).
Vitalik Buterin and the majority chose Option 2, proving that decentralized blockchains are still subject to human consensus when enough money is at stake.
