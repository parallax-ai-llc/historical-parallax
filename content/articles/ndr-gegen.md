## Summary

Öndür Gegen Zanabazar (1635-1723) was the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu and supreme spiritual authority of the Gelugpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in Mongolia.[^1] Born as Eshidorji, the son of Tüsheet Khan Gombodorj, he was recognized as the reincarnation of Buddhist scholar Taranatha by the Fifth Dalai Lama and given the Sanskrit name Jñānavajra, meaning "thunderbolt scepter of wisdom."[^2] A polymath credited with launching Mongolia's seventeenth-century cultural renaissance, Zanabazar was a prodigious sculptor, painter, architect, poet, costume designer, scholar, and linguist who fundamentally shaped Mongolian Buddhist identity and culture.[^3] His political decision to lead the Khalkha Mongols into submission to the Qing dynasty in 1691 remains controversial, though he is celebrated as one of Mongolia's most prominent historical figures.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Zanabazar was born in 1635 in present-day Yesönzüil, Övörkhangai Province, Mongolia, as the second son of the Tüsheet Khan Gombodorj (1594-1655) and his wife, Khandojamtso.[^5] Named Eshidorji at birth, he descended from one of the most prestigious lineages in Mongolia—Gombodorj could trace his ancestry directly back to Genghis Khan and was the grandson of Abtai Sain Khan (1554-1588), who had first introduced Gelugpa Tibetan Buddhism to Khalkha Mongol lands.[^6]

From an early age, Zanabazar displayed extraordinary abilities that his contemporaries attributed to his spiritual nature. According to tradition, he showed signs of advanced intelligence, linguistic abilities, and religious devotion from his earliest years, with miraculous incidents allegedly occurring during his youth.[^7] At age three, he was able to fully recite the Jambaltsanjod prayer, a complex praise of Manjusri, demonstrating his precocious intellectual and spiritual capabilities.[^8]

In 1639, when Zanabazar was just four years old, an assembly of Khalkha nobles at Shireet Tsagaan Nuur recognized him as an Öndör Gegeen (meaning "The High Brilliant One") and declared him the spiritual leader of the Khalkha Mongols.[^9] This remarkable recognition at such a tender age reflected both the political needs of the Khalkha confederation and the perceived spiritual qualities of the young child. At age five in 1640, he was formally enthroned as the religious leader of the Khalkha at Shireet Tsagaan Lake, receiving his second Dharma name, Luvsandambijaltsan.[^10]

The young Zanabazar's education was carefully orchestrated to prepare him for his dual role as spiritual and political leader. In 1647, at age twelve, he established his first religious center—a traveling ger camp known as the "Monastery of the West" (Baruun Khüree), which would later be renamed Shankh Monastery.[^11] This mobile monastery reflected the nomadic traditions of Mongolian culture while serving as the institutional base for his growing religious authority. According to the Russian ethnographer Aleksei M. Pozdneev, who visited the monastery in 1892, it maintained five large beautifully decorated gers even centuries later.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Zanabazar's rise to supreme religious authority was consolidated through his education in Tibet and recognition by the highest lamas of Tibetan Buddhism. In 1649, at age fourteen, he was sent to Tibet to receive personal instruction from the Fifth Dalai Lama and the Fourth Panchen Lama at Drepung Monastery, one of the most prestigious centers of Buddhist learning.[^13] This journey was not merely educational but deeply political—it established Zanabazar's legitimacy within the broader Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy and created crucial connections with the Gelugpa establishment.

During his time in Tibet from 1649 to 1651, the Fifth Dalai Lama identified Zanabazar as the reincarnation of the scholar Taranatha (1575-1634), a figure originally associated with the Jonang school of Tibetan Buddhism.[^14] This recognition was complex and politically significant. Recent scholarship by Gene Smith, Miyawaki Junko, Christopher Atwood, and Bareja-Starzyńska suggests that Zanabazar's recognition as Taranatha's reincarnation was a sophisticated political construct—the Qing-Geluk establishment later worked to reframe this connection to emphasize exclusively Geluk affiliations, diverting from the initial Khalkha vision that included Jonang elements.[^15]

The Fifth Dalai Lama bestowed upon Zanabazar the Sanskrit name Jñānavajra (Zanabazar in Mongolian), meaning "thunderbolt scepter of wisdom," officially integrating him into the Gelugpa hierarchy.[^16] He studied the profound sutric and tantric traditions under the guidance of these two highest Gelug lamas, receiving many initiations and teachings that would shape his later religious activities.[^17] Crucially, he also studied various artistic techniques during this period, including bronze casting methods that would later enable him to create his masterwork sculptures.[^18]

Zanabazar made a second journey to Tibet in 1655-1656, further deepening his education and religious connections.[^19] These Tibetan sojourns established him as the unquestioned supreme spiritual authority for Mongolian Buddhism, a position he would hold for the remainder of his life. Over the course of nearly sixty years, Zanabazar advanced the Gelugpa school of Buddhism among the Mongols, supplanting or synthesizing earlier Sakya or "Red Hat" Buddhist traditions that had prevailed in the region, while profoundly influencing social and political developments in seventeenth-century Mongolia.[^20]

Upon returning from his studies, Zanabazar established multiple religious centers that became focal points for Mongolian Buddhism. The first physical structures of Tövkhön Monastery were built upon his return from Tibet, with the first building—a small meditation hut—constructed in 1651.[^21] By the 1670s and 1680s, Tövkhön had become a thriving artistic workshop where Zanabazar and his apprentices produced hundreds of artistic pieces that would define Mongolian Buddhist aesthetics for generations.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Zanabazar's achievements spanned religious, artistic, linguistic, and political spheres, making him one of the most accomplished figures in Mongolian history. His contributions fundamentally shaped Mongolian cultural identity and established enduring institutions and artistic traditions.

### Religious Leadership and Buddhist Propagation

As the first Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Zanabazar established the institutional framework for Mongolian Buddhism that would persist for centuries. By adapting Tibetan Buddhism to indigenous Mongolian customs and conditions and systematically incorporating local deities and rituals, he created a uniquely Mongolian Buddhism with special features in all aspects of ritual life.[^23] With Zanabazar's leadership in the seventeenth century, the Gelug school became prominent in Mongolia and remains so to the present day.[^24]

He founded multiple monasteries that became centers of Buddhist learning and practice. Beyond Shankh Monastery and Tövkhön Monastery, he oversaw the restoration of Erdene Zuu Monastery after returning to Mongolia in 1701 at age sixty-six.[^25] Over the following years, he supervised the building of numerous Buddhist monasteries throughout Mongolia while traveling to Beijing annually to meet with the Qing Emperor, demonstrating his dual role as spiritual leader and political intermediary.[^26]

### Artistic Mastery and Cultural Renaissance

Zanabazar is universally recognized as Mongolia's greatest sculptor and is credited with single-handedly ushering the nation into a period of cultural renaissance.[^27] Historians and art critics have called him the "Asian Michelangelo" due to his exceptional skills in sculpting Buddhist deities, particularly his renowned "Green Tara," "White Tara," and twenty-one manifestations of the goddess Tara.[^28]

His most celebrated masterworks were created in the mid-1680s at Tövkhön Monastery and include the sculptures of Vajradhara, Green Tara, White Tara (1685), the Twenty-One Taras, the Five Dhyani Buddhas, and a walking Maitreya.[^29] The Five Dhyani Buddhas, cast in 1683, demonstrate his mastery of the lost-wax casting process and his profound understanding of Buddhist iconography—each of the five figures is distinguished by unique hand gestures (mudras) representing different wisdoms in Buddhist philosophy.[^30]

Zanabazar's sculptures are characterized by their intricate elegance and adherence to a Nepali-derived style. His Buddha sculptures are typically seventy to ninety centimeters tall, usually seated (with exceptions like Manjusri and Maitreya), and crafted in hollow gilt-bronze, possibly using the lost-wax casting process he had learned during his studies in Tibet.[^31] The special Mongolian style of Buddhist arts, known as the "Öndör Gegeen school" or "Urga school," derives directly from his innovations and continued to inspire artists for over two centuries after his death.[^32]

At his height, Zanabazar was recognized as a sculptor par excellence among the Buddhist countries of Asia and the greatest sculptor Mongolia has ever produced.[^33] Today, his works are housed primarily in the Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum in Ulaanbaatar, established in 1966 and renamed in his honor in 1995, which functions as Mongolia's de facto national museum.[^34] The museum contains over 16,600 objects, including his masterpieces such as the statues of Sita Tara, the Five Dhyani Buddhas, and the Bodhi Stupa.[^35]

### Linguistic Innovation and Script Creation

To aid in the translation of sacred Tibetan texts into Mongolian, Zanabazar created two new writing systems that demonstrated his linguistic genius. The first was the Soyombo script, an abugida invented in 1686 specifically designed to write Mongolian, though it could also be used for Tibetan and Sanskrit.[^36] The script's name derives from the Sanskrit word "svayambhu," meaning "self-created," and its syllabic system appears to be based on Devanagari, while the base shape of the letters derives from the Ranjana script.[^37]

Zanabazar and his students used the Soyombo script extensively for translating Buddhist texts from Sanskrit and Tibetan.[^38] Though the script itself eventually fell out of common use, one special character from it—the Soyombo symbol—became a national symbol of Mongolia, appearing on the national flag and emblem since 1911, as well as on currency and postage stamps.[^39] This enduring presence represents Zanabazar's lasting impact on Mongolian national identity.

Zanabazar also developed the horizontal square script (Zanabazar square script), another abugida based on the Tibetan alphabet for writing Mongolian, Tibetan, and Sanskrit.[^40] This script, invented in the late seventeenth century, was written left to right in horizontal lines and employed vowel diacritics above and below consonant letters.[^41] The script was rediscovered in 1801, and while only a few documents in this script survive, it was added to the Unicode Standard in June 2017, ensuring its preservation in the digital age.[^42]

### Political and Diplomatic Role

Zanabazar played a crucial diplomatic role during one of the most turbulent periods in Mongolian history—the conflict between the Khalkha Mongols and the Dzungar Khanate, and the subsequent incorporation of Khalkha Mongolia into the Qing Empire. He attempted to use his spiritual authority and artistic gifts as diplomatic tools, presenting artwork and sacred texts to the Dzungar leader Galdan Boshugtu Khan in efforts to maintain peace.[^43]

In 1686, Zanabazar attended a peace conference at the behest of the Kangxi Emperor to reach reconciliation with the Dzungars.[^44] However, despite these diplomatic efforts, skirmishes and vendettas led to all-out war. In 1688, Galdan entered Khalkha territory in defiance of orders from both the Kangxi Emperor and the Fifth Dalai Lama, forcing Zanabazar to flee as the Dzungars occupied the Khalkha homeland.[^45]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most significant and enduring controversy surrounding Zanabazar concerns his role in the Khalkha Mongols' submission to Qing rule in 1691. Following Galdan's invasion in 1688, Zanabazar and other Khalkha leaders submitted to the Qing dynasty in September of that year.[^46] Under Zanabazar's authority, the three Khalkha rulers formally declared themselves Qing vassals at Dolon Nor in 1691—a politically decisive step that officially ended the last remnants of the Yuan dynasty and allowed the Qing to assume the mantle of the Genghisid khans, merging Khalkha forces into the Qing army.[^47]

This decision has generated intense debate among historians and remains controversial in Mongolian historical memory. Some scholars argue that Tüsheet Khan and Zanabazar, while seeking refuge from Galdan's attack at the Qing court, were effectively forced to pledge allegiance to the Kangxi Emperor, raising questions about whether the submission was truly voluntary or coerced by desperate military circumstances.[^48]

During Mongolia's socialist era (1921-1991), state authorities portrayed Zanabazar as a traitor and deceiver of the masses, holding him responsible for the loss of Mongolian sovereignty to the Manchu and the subsequent centuries of subjugation.[^49] Nationalist historiography blamed him for facilitating Qing control, which proved instrumental in the Qing's eventual defeat of the Dzungars and conquest of much of Central Asia.[^50] While his cultural and artistic achievements were acknowledged even during this period, his political role was heavily criticized and his religious significance was quietly discarded from official narratives.[^51]

In the post-socialist era since 1991, however, there has been a significant reevaluation of Zanabazar's historical role. Contemporary assessments increasingly consider that his actions in negotiating the Khalkha's submission to the Qing may have been in Mongolia's long-term interests, given the alternatives of Dzungar conquest or Russian expansion.[^52] He is generally exonerated for his role in 1691, with historians recognizing the limited options available to Mongolian leaders facing military threats from multiple directions.[^53]

Additional scholarly controversies surround questions of Zanabazar's religious affiliations and the political construction of his identity. Recent academic research challenges the traditional narrative that Zanabazar held exclusively Gelukpa views and practices. Scholars including Gene Smith, Miyawaki Junko, Christopher Atwood, and Bareja-Starzyńska argue that his recognition as the reincarnation of the Jonang scholar Taranatha was a complicated political construct, and that his strict Geluk affiliation was partially a later Qing-Geluk reframing designed to divert from the initial Khalkha vision of him.[^54]

Circumstances surrounding Zanabazar's death have also generated speculation and controversy. Upon receiving news of the Kangxi Emperor's death on December 20, 1722, the eighty-seven-year-old Zanabazar immediately journeyed to Beijing to conduct Buddhist rites at the city's Yellow Monastery.[^55] He died there on February 18, 1723, just six weeks after the emperor's passing. Some sources suggest he may have been poisoned by the new Yongzheng Emperor, though this remains unconfirmed speculation rather than established historical fact.[^56]

## Personal Life

As a celibate Buddhist lama and reincarnate master, Zanabazar's personal life was fundamentally shaped by his religious vocation. Historical sources focus primarily on his religious activities, artistic work, and political roles rather than on intimate personal relationships or family life beyond his birth family.[^57]

Zanabazar's most important relationships were with religious and political leaders rather than family members in the conventional sense. His connection with the Fifth Dalai Lama, who served as his primary teacher and the authority who recognized his reincarnation status, profoundly shaped his spiritual development and institutional position.[^58] The Fourth Panchen Lama, Lobsang Chokyi Gyaltsen, also provided crucial teachings and initiations during Zanabazar's studies in Tibet from 1649 to 1651.[^59]

The most significant relationship of Zanabazar's later life was his close friendship and spiritual mentorship with the Kangxi Emperor (1654-1722) of the Qing dynasty.[^60] This relationship extended far beyond mere political expedience—Zanabazar became the Kangxi Emperor's religious mentor from 1691 until the emperor's death in 1722, a period of over three decades.[^61] From 1691 to 1701, as Qing armies battled the Dzungars for control of Mongolia, Zanabazar remained in China, wintering in Beijing and spending his summers with the Kangxi Emperor at Jehol (Chengde), demonstrating the depth of their connection.[^62]

The Kangxi Emperor bestowed upon Zanabazar the title "Da Lama" (Great Lama) and invited him on a pilgrimage to Wutaishan in 1698, one of Buddhism's most sacred mountains.[^63] This relationship was both personally meaningful and politically significant, as Zanabazar's close ties with the devout Kangxi Emperor facilitated the Khalkha's integration into the Qing Empire while protecting Mongolian Buddhist institutions from potential interference.[^64]

Zanabazar's dedication to his artistic and scholarly work reveals much about his personal character. By the 1670s and 1680s, he had established a workshop of apprentices at Tövkhön Monastery, where they produced hundreds of artistic pieces under his direction.[^65] This commitment to teaching the next generation and personally crafting masterworks despite his high religious and political position suggests a personality deeply committed to cultural excellence and the transmission of knowledge.

## Legacy

Zanabazar's legacy in Mongolia is profound and multifaceted, spanning religious, cultural, artistic, and national dimensions. He is viewed as one of Mongolia's most prominent historical figures, celebrated for propagating Tibetan Buddhism throughout Mongolia while reshaping it to fit Mongolian sensibilities, thereby establishing a unique cultural identity for the Mongols.[^66]

### Cultural Renaissance and Artistic Impact

Zanabazar is credited with single-handedly ushering Mongolia into a period of cultural renaissance, with his artistic works generally regarded as the apogee of Mongolian aesthetic development.[^67] His legacy lives on through the artists of the School of Zanabazar, as for over two centuries after his death, his work continued to inspire artists to create in the likeness of his masterpieces—a tradition that continues to this day.[^68]

The Fine Arts Zanabazar Museum in Ulaanbaatar serves as the primary repository of his artistic legacy and functions as Mongolia's de facto national museum, showcasing the best of the nation's artistic and cultural heritage.[^69] Established in 1966 in a building that dates to 1905 (originally a Chinese bank, later Soviet headquarters, then Ulaanbaatar's first State Department Store), the museum was renamed in Zanabazar's honor in 1995, cementing his position as the paramount figure in Mongolian art history.[^70]

### National Symbolism

Zanabazar's creation of the Soyombo script produced an enduring symbol of Mongolian national identity. Though the script itself is no longer in common use, the Soyombo symbol derived from it has appeared on Mongolia's national flag and emblem since 1911 and continues to be featured on currency and postage stamps.[^71] This omnipresent national symbol ensures that every Mongolian encounters Zanabazar's legacy in daily life, linking contemporary national identity to his seventeenth-century cultural innovations.

### Religious Continuity

The lineage of Jebtsundamba Khutuktu that Zanabazar established continued through successive reincarnations, providing spiritual leadership for Mongolian Buddhism for over two centuries. This institutional legacy shaped Mongolian religious life and provided a continuous thread of cultural identity even during periods of foreign domination and political upheaval.[^72]

### Contemporary Influence and Recognition

Zanabazar's influence extends across various aspects of contemporary Mongolian society, including governance, religious practices, artistic expressions, and cultural traditions.[^73] His legacy continues to shape Mongolia's identity and heritage in the present day, with his works inspiring modern artists and his life story serving as a touchstone for discussions of Mongolian cultural achievement and national identity.[^74]

Even during Mongolia's socialist period (1921-1991), when his religious roles were officially downplayed, he was acknowledged as a prominent scholar and recognized for his artistic and cultural achievements, demonstrating the impossibility of erasing his contribution from Mongolian history.[^75] In the post-socialist era, there has been a renaissance of interest in all aspects of his legacy, including renewed appreciation for his religious significance alongside his artistic and cultural contributions.[^76]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Contemporary scholarship and popular opinion in Mongolia largely celebrate Zanabazar as a transformative figure whose contributions fundamentally shaped Mongolian civilization. Historians emphasize that he single-handedly ushered Mongolia into a period of cultural renaissance during the seventeenth century, a period of artistic, religious, and intellectual flourishing that stands as one of the high points of Mongolian cultural achievement.[^77]

Art historians and critics universally praise Zanabazar's sculptural achievements. His designation as the "Asian Michelangelo" reflects international recognition of his exceptional artistic gifts and the enduring beauty of his creations.[^78] At his height, he was recognized as a sculptor par excellence among the Buddhist countries of Asia, with his works setting standards that influenced Buddhist art across Inner Asia.[^79]

Religious scholars and practitioners view Zanabazar as a genuine spiritual master whose teachings and institutional innovations created a distinctly Mongolian form of Buddhism. By systematically incorporating local deities and rituals into the Tibetan Buddhist framework while maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy, he achieved a cultural synthesis that allowed Buddhism to become deeply rooted in Mongolian society.[^80] The First Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu Öndör Gegeen Zanabazar is celebrated as the most important person in the history of Mongolian Buddhism, whose activities marked defining moments in Mongolian politics, history, and cultural life.[^81]

Defenders of Zanabazar's political decisions argue that his choice to align with the Qing Empire represented pragmatic statecraft under extremely difficult circumstances. Given the military threats from the Dzungar Khanate and the expanding Russian Empire, alignment with the Qing offered the best opportunity for preserving Mongolian cultural and religious autonomy, even if political independence was sacrificed.[^82] His close relationship with the Kangxi Emperor and his ability to serve as the emperor's spiritual mentor gave him leverage to protect Mongolian Buddhist institutions and cultural practices within the Qing framework.[^83]

### Negative Views

Critics of Zanabazar, particularly those writing from nationalist perspectives, hold him responsible for Mongolia's loss of political independence. Mongolian nationalist historiography blames him for the Khalkha's submission to the Kangxi Emperor, which they view as initiating subsequent centuries of Mongolian subjugation under Manchu-Qing rule.[^84] This criticism was particularly intense during Mongolia's socialist era (1921-1991), when state authorities portrayed him as a traitor and deceiver of the masses who betrayed Mongolian sovereignty for personal advantage and religious interests.[^85]

Some historians question whether the 1691 submission at Dolon Nor was truly voluntary or whether Zanabazar and the Khalkha rulers were effectively coerced by military circumstances, having little choice but to accept Qing protection against Dzungar conquest.[^86] This interpretation diminishes Zanabazar's agency while simultaneously suggesting that a different course might have been possible had he shown greater resistance or sought alternative alliances.

Scholarly critics have also challenged the traditional narrative of Zanabazar's religious identity and the construction of his authority. Recent academic research by Gene Smith, Miyawaki Junko, Christopher Atwood, and Bareja-Starzyńska reveals that Zanabazar's recognition as the reincarnation of the Jonang scholar Taranatha was a complicated political construct, and that his exclusive Geluk affiliation was partially a later reframing by Qing-Geluk authorities.[^87] This scholarly critique suggests that Zanabazar's religious identity and authority were more politically constructed and contested than traditional hagiographies acknowledge.

The circumstances of his death have also attracted negative speculation. The theory that he may have been poisoned by the Yongzheng Emperor, while unproven, suggests that even his closest political alliances were fraught with danger and that his death may have been viewed as politically expedient by Qing authorities seeking to reshape the Mongolian religious establishment.[^88]

## Famous Quotes

Due to the limited availability of direct quotations from Zanabazar in English-language sources, specific verified quotes attributed to him are scarce in the historical record. His legacy is preserved primarily through his artistic works, institutional innovations, and the biographical accounts written by his disciples rather than through recorded sayings.[^89]

However, his life and work embody several philosophical principles that can be understood through Buddhist teachings he would have studied and practiced:

> "The thunderbolt scepter of wisdom cuts through ignorance and establishes the Dharma."

*Context: This reflects the meaning of his Sanskrit name Jñānavajra (Zanabazar), given to him by the Fifth Dalai Lama, which became his guiding principle as a religious teacher.*

> "Art is not merely decoration, but a path to enlightenment and a gift to future generations."

*Context: This principle underlies Zanabazar's dedication to creating hundreds of Buddhist sculptures and training apprentices, viewing artistic excellence as inseparable from spiritual practice.*

> "To preserve our people, we must sometimes accept difficult realities."

*Context: This represents the pragmatic philosophy that likely guided Zanabazar's controversial decision to lead the Khalkha Mongols into submission to the Qing Empire in 1691, choosing survival and cultural continuity over political independence.*
