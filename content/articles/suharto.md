## Summary

Suharto was an Indonesian military leader who served as the second president of Indonesia from 1967 to 1998, ruling for 31 years in what became known as the "New Order" regime. Rising to power following the controversial 1965-66 transition period that saw the fall of Indonesia's founding president Sukarno, Suharto established an authoritarian government that brought economic development and political stability while simultaneously engaging in widespread human rights abuses, corruption, and suppression of dissent. His regime oversaw Indonesia's transformation into a rapidly developing economy but was also responsible for mass killings, the occupation of East Timor, and the systematic enrichment of his family and cronies. Forced to resign in 1998 amid economic crisis and popular protests, Suharto left a complex and deeply contested legacy as both a modernizer and a dictator whose rule caused immense suffering.

## Early Life and Background

Suharto was born on June 8, 1921, in a small village called Kemusuk, near Yogyakarta in central Java, during the Dutch colonial period. His birth name was simply Suharto—like many Javanese of his era, he used only one name. The circumstances of his early life were humble and somewhat unstable. His father, Kertosudiro, was a village irrigation official, while his mother, Sukirah, came from a slightly higher social standing. However, his parents' marriage was troubled, and they divorced when Suharto was young, leading to a childhood marked by frequent moves between the homes of various relatives.[^1]

This peripatetic upbringing exposed young Suharto to different social environments and may have contributed to the adaptability and political cunning he would later display. He received only a basic education, attending a Dutch-language primary school but never completing secondary education. During his youth, Suharto worked various jobs, including as a bank clerk, before finding his calling in the military.[^2]

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia from 1942 to 1945 proved to be a turning point for Suharto, as it was for many Indonesians of his generation. He joined the Japanese-sponsored militia and received military training, marking the beginning of his military career. When Indonesia declared independence in 1945 following Japan's surrender, Suharto joined the newly formed Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) and participated in the Indonesian National Revolution against the returning Dutch colonial forces. These formative years of combat shaped his worldview and established him within the military hierarchy that would later propel him to power.[^3]

Suharto's early military career was marked by steady advancement, though he was not among the most prominent revolutionary heroes. He demonstrated competence as a battalion and later regimental commander during the revolution and subsequent conflicts. His Javanese cultural background, with its emphasis on hierarchy, patience, and indirect communication, would profoundly influence his political style. Unlike the charismatic and ideologically driven Sukarno, Suharto was methodical, pragmatic, and skilled in the traditional Javanese art of political maneuvering.[^4]

## Rise to Power

Suharto's ascent to supreme power was gradual and opportunistic, culminating in the tumultuous events of 1965-66 that remain controversial to this day. Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, he advanced through the military ranks, commanding various units and serving in Central Java and Jakarta. By 1965, he had achieved the rank of major general and commanded the Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad), a significant but not supreme position within the Indonesian military.[^5]

The critical turning point came on the night of September 30, 1965, when a group of military officers kidnapped and murdered six senior army generals in what became known as the "30 September Movement" or G30S. The exact nature and motivations of this movement remain disputed, with official accounts claiming it was a communist coup attempt, while alternative interpretations suggest it may have been an internal military conflict or even a provocation. Suharto, who was not targeted in the kidnappings, moved quickly to suppress the movement, taking command of the army in the power vacuum created by the deaths of senior officers.[^6]

In the aftermath of the failed movement, Suharto orchestrated a systematic campaign to destroy the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), which was blamed for the events. What followed was one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century. Between October 1965 and early 1966, an estimated 500,000 to 1 million alleged communists, ethnic Chinese, and other perceived enemies were killed in a wave of violence involving the military, religious groups, and civilian militias. Suharto's role in directing or permitting these killings has been extensively documented, though he consistently denied direct responsibility.[^7]

Using the chaos and anti-communist fervor, Suharto gradually maneuvered to sideline President Sukarno, Indonesia's founding father and leader since independence. In March 1966, Sukarno signed the Supersemar document, which granted Suharto emergency powers to restore order—a document whose authenticity and the circumstances of its signing remain disputed. Suharto used these powers to consolidate control, banning the PKI, purging Sukarno loyalists, and reversing Indonesia's foreign policy from the non-aligned movement toward the Western bloc.[^8]

By 1967, the People's Consultative Assembly stripped Sukarno of his remaining powers and appointed Suharto acting president. In 1968, he was formally elected president, beginning what would become a 31-year reign. This transition period, euphemistically called the "transition to the New Order," was marked by violence, propaganda, and the systematic elimination of political opposition. Suharto had successfully transformed himself from a mid-ranking general to the unquestioned leader of Indonesia.[^9]

## Major Achievements

Suharto's supporters point to significant economic development and political stability during his three-decade rule as his primary achievements. When he took power, Indonesia was in economic chaos, with hyperinflation exceeding 600%, food shortages, and a collapsing infrastructure. Working with a group of American-educated economists known as the "Berkeley Mafia," Suharto implemented market-oriented reforms, opened Indonesia to foreign investment, and pursued export-led growth strategies.[^10]

The results were impressive by conventional economic measures. Indonesia's GDP grew at an average of 7% annually between 1968 and 1997, transforming the country from one of the world's poorest nations into a middle-income economy. Poverty rates declined substantially, from approximately 60% in 1970 to 11% by 1996. Infrastructure development was extensive, with roads, schools, hospitals, and telecommunications networks expanding across the vast archipelago. The Green Revolution in agriculture, promoted through programs like BIMAS and INMAS, helped Indonesia achieve rice self-sufficiency by 1984, a significant accomplishment for a nation that had been a major rice importer.[^11]

Education and healthcare saw measurable improvements during the Suharto era. Primary school enrollment became nearly universal, literacy rates increased dramatically, and life expectancy rose from 45 years in 1965 to 65 years by 1997. The government implemented family planning programs that successfully reduced fertility rates, easing population pressures. These social indicators represented genuine improvements in the lives of millions of Indonesians.[^12]

Suharto also maintained Indonesia's territorial integrity and national unity during a period when many post-colonial nations fragmented. He suppressed separatist movements in various regions, though often through brutal military operations. The New Order regime promoted a homogenizing national identity through the state ideology of Pancasila, national language policies, and transmigration programs that relocated Javanese to outer islands.[^13]

In foreign policy, Suharto positioned Indonesia as a leading member of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and a key American ally during the Cold War. Indonesia became a stabilizing force in Southeast Asia, mediating regional conflicts and promoting economic cooperation. Western governments and international financial institutions praised Suharto's Indonesia as a model of development and political stability in the developing world.[^14]

The regime also invested in certain cultural projects, including the restoration of historical sites like Borobudur, the promotion of Indonesian arts and crafts, and the development of museums and cultural institutions. Tourism became an important economic sector, showcasing Indonesia's cultural heritage to the world.[^15]

From a technocratic perspective, Suharto's government demonstrated competence in macroeconomic management for most of his rule, maintaining relatively low inflation, manageable debt levels, and stable exchange rates until the late 1990s. The bureaucracy, while corrupt, functioned well enough to implement large-scale development programs and maintain order across the diverse archipelago.[^16]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The dark side of Suharto's legacy is extensive and deeply troubling, involving systematic human rights abuses, corruption on an extraordinary scale, and the violent suppression of dissent. The mass killings of 1965-66, which brought him to power, represent one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century. International scholars and human rights organizations have documented the systematic nature of these killings, with evidence of military coordination and Suharto's central role. The anti-communist purge destroyed not only the PKI but also Indonesia's vibrant civil society, trade unions, and political pluralism.[^17]

The invasion and occupation of East Timor in 1975 stands as another major crime of the Suharto regime. Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese colony shortly after its declaration of independence, beginning an occupation that would last 24 years and result in the deaths of an estimated 100,000-180,000 East Timorese—nearly a quarter of the pre-invasion population—through violence, starvation, and disease. The international community largely acquiesced to this aggression, with the United States and Australia providing diplomatic cover and military support. The occupation involved widespread human rights abuses, including torture, sexual violence, forced displacement, and cultural suppression.[^18]

Throughout his rule, Suharto's military engaged in brutal counterinsurgency operations in Papua, Aceh, and other regions where separatist movements existed. These operations involved extrajudicial killings, torture, disappearances, and the targeting of civilian populations. The Operasi Koteka in Papua and the military emergency in Aceh involved systematic human rights violations that have been documented by numerous human rights organizations.[^19]

Political repression was a defining feature of the New Order. Suharto banned all political parties except two neutered opposition parties and his own ruling Golkar organization. The military intelligence services, particularly the feared Kopkamtib and later Bakin, maintained extensive surveillance networks, infiltrated civil society organizations, and routinely arrested, tortured, and killed dissidents. Thousands of suspected communists were imprisoned without trial on the prison island of Buru, where many died from harsh conditions.[^20]

Press freedom was severely restricted, with publications required to have government licenses that could be revoked at any time. Journalists practiced self-censorship, and critical publications were regularly banned. The regime controlled television and radio broadcasting, using media as a propaganda tool. Academic freedom was similarly constrained, with scholars who expressed critical views risking dismissal or arrest.[^21]

Perhaps most shocking was the scale of corruption under Suharto. Transparency International has estimated that Suharto embezzled between $15 billion and $35 billion during his rule, potentially making him the most corrupt leader in modern history. His six children and other family members controlled vast business empires, receiving monopolies, licenses, and contracts through their political connections. This "KKN" (Korupsi, Kolusi, Nepotisme—Corruption, Collusion, Nepotism) system permeated all levels of government and business, distorting the economy and creating massive inequality.[^22]

The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis exposed the structural weaknesses of Indonesia's crony capitalist system. The economy contracted sharply, unemployment soared, and food prices skyrocketed, causing widespread suffering. The crisis revealed how much of Indonesia's apparent economic success had been built on unsustainable foundations of foreign debt, connected lending, and monopolistic practices.[^23]

Environmental destruction accelerated under Suharto, with massive deforestation driven by logging concessions granted to regime cronies, plantation development, and transmigration programs. Indigenous communities were displaced, biodiversity declined, and Indonesia became one of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters due to deforestation and peatland fires.[^24]

The regime's treatment of ethnic Chinese Indonesians was particularly hypocritical—while Chinese businessmen like Liem Sioe Liong were key Suharto cronies, the broader Chinese Indonesian community faced systematic discrimination, cultural suppression, and periodic violence, culminating in the May 1998 riots in which Chinese-owned properties were targeted and numerous Chinese Indonesian women were raped.[^25]

## Personal Life

Suharto married Siti Hartinah, commonly known as Madame Tien, in 1947, and their marriage lasted until her death in 1996. The couple had six children: Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana (Tutut), Sigit Harjojudanto, Bambang Trihatmodjo, Siti Hediati Hariyadi (Titiek), Hutomo Mandala Putra (Tommy), and Siti Hutami Endang Adiningsih (Mamiek). Tien was a significant political figure in her own right, often called "Madame Tien Percent" for her alleged involvement in demanding kickbacks on government contracts. Her death in 1996 was seen by many as removing a stabilizing influence on Suharto, contributing to his increasingly erratic leadership in his final years.[^26]

The Suharto children became notorious for their business empires and lavish lifestyles. Each controlled major corporations in sectors ranging from telecommunications to petrochemicals to toll roads, typically built on monopolies or favorable regulations. Tommy Suharto, the youngest son, was perhaps the most controversial, with business interests in petroleum, automobiles, and the Timor national car project. After his father's fall, Tommy was convicted of ordering the assassination of a Supreme Court judge and served prison time, though critics argued he received preferential treatment.[^27]

Suharto himself cultivated an image of Javanese humility and traditional values, often wearing simple batik shirts and presenting himself as a father figure to the nation. He practiced Javanese mysticism and was known to consult with spiritual advisors. Despite ruling over vast corruption, he maintained a relatively modest personal lifestyle compared to some dictators, though his family's wealth was astronomical. His official residence at Cendana Street in Jakarta became a symbol of power and patronage.[^28]

Those who knew Suharto personally often described him as soft-spoken, methodical, and inscrutable. He preferred indirect communication and was a master of the Javanese political arts of ambiguity and patience. Unlike the flamboyant Sukarno, Suharto rarely gave lengthy speeches or engaged in ideological debates. He was a voracious reader of intelligence reports and maintained detailed knowledge of military and political affairs. Some observers noted his capacity for ruthlessness combined with personal charm.[^29]

Suharto had a passion for wayang (traditional puppet theater) and Javanese gamelan music, seeing himself as a guardian of Javanese culture even as his regime promoted a homogenized national identity. He was also known to enjoy golf and maintained several properties across Java where he could retreat from the pressures of office.[^30]

In his final decade of rule, particularly after Tien's death, Suharto became increasingly isolated, surrounded by sycophants who shielded him from bad news. This isolation contributed to his disastrous handling of the 1997-98 economic crisis and his apparent surprise at the scale of public opposition that ultimately forced his resignation.[^31]

After his resignation in May 1998, Suharto lived quietly in Jakarta under house arrest and later with restricted movement. Efforts to prosecute him for corruption and human rights abuses were repeatedly derailed by claims of poor health. He suffered a series of strokes that left him partially incapacitated. Many Indonesians felt cheated that he never faced justice for his crimes. Suharto died on January 27, 2008, at age 86, receiving a state funeral that reflected the ambivalence Indonesians felt toward their former leader.[^32]

## Legacy

Suharto's legacy remains intensely contested in Indonesia and internationally. His 31-year rule fundamentally shaped modern Indonesia, and debates about his impact continue to divide scholars, politicians, and ordinary Indonesians. The question of whether his economic development justified his authoritarian methods remains unresolved and perhaps unresolvable.[^33]

Economically, Suharto left Indonesia significantly more developed than he found it, with better infrastructure, lower poverty rates, and a larger middle class. However, the 1997-98 crisis revealed that much of this development was built on unsustainable foundations. The crony capitalism he fostered created oligarchic structures that persist in Indonesian politics and business today. Inequality increased during his rule, with wealth concentrated in the hands of a small elite connected to the regime.[^34]

Politically, Suharto's New Order destroyed Indonesia's nascent democracy and created authoritarian structures that have proven difficult to fully dismantle. The military's dwifungsi (dual function) doctrine, which justified military involvement in civilian affairs, was formally ended after his fall but continues to influence Indonesian politics. The political parties he neutered took years to rebuild genuine grassroots organizations. Civil society, crushed in 1965-66, is still recovering.[^35]

The culture of corruption that Suharto institutionalized remains one of Indonesia's greatest challenges. Despite reform efforts since 1998, Indonesia continues to rank poorly on corruption indices. The networks of patronage and collusion that characterized the New Order have adapted to democratic conditions but remain entrenched. Many of Suharto's former associates and their descendants continue to wield significant influence.[^36]

For human rights, Suharto's legacy is unambiguously negative. The mass killings of 1965-66 have never been fully acknowledged or addressed. Victims and their families have received no justice or compensation. The occupation of East Timor ended only in 1999, and reconciliation remains incomplete. Papua and Aceh continue to experience tensions rooted in New Order-era violence and marginalization.[^37]

Indonesia's national identity was significantly shaped by Suharto's homogenizing policies. While he maintained territorial integrity, this came at the cost of suppressing regional identities and minority cultures. The transmigration program created ethnic tensions that persist in many regions. The enforced promotion of Bahasa Indonesia and Pancasila created a degree of national unity but also alienated many non-Javanese Indonesians.[^38]

Internationally, Suharto transformed Indonesia from a non-aligned revolutionary state into a pro-Western, capitalist-oriented regional power. ASEAN became more cohesive under his leadership, and Southeast Asia enjoyed relative stability during the Cold War. However, this came with Western complicity in his human rights abuses, as the United States, Australia, and European nations provided military aid and diplomatic support despite knowing about atrocities.[^39]

Environmental degradation during the Suharto era created problems that will take generations to address. Deforestation rates were among the world's highest, biodiversity declined, and climate change commitments were ignored. The logging and plantation interests he enriched continue to resist environmental protection measures.[^40]

Culturally, there are paradoxes in Suharto's legacy. While he suppressed political and press freedom, his regime saw the growth of Indonesian popular culture, including music, film, and literature (within strict boundaries). Education expansion created a more literate population, even if critical thinking was discouraged. The restoration of historical sites preserved cultural heritage, though often in service of nationalist mythology.[^41]

In the years since his death, there has been concerning nostalgia for the Suharto era among some Indonesians, particularly those frustrated with the messy democratic politics and continued corruption of the post-1998 period. This selective memory focuses on economic growth and stability while minimizing or ignoring the violence and repression. Understanding why authoritarian nostalgia persists remains important for Indonesian democracy.[^42]

The failure to achieve transitional justice after Suharto's fall has had long-term consequences. Without truth-telling, accountability, or reparations for New Order victims, Indonesia has struggled to fully confront its authoritarian past. This incomplete reckoning affects contemporary politics and makes democratic backsliding more possible.[^43]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders and some scholars argue that Suharto should be evaluated in the context of Indonesia's situation when he took power and the challenges he faced. In this view, Indonesia in 1965 was on the verge of disintegration, with economic collapse, political chaos, and the threat of communist takeover. Suharto's authoritarian rule provided the stability necessary for economic development and nation-building in a diverse archipelago with little prior experience of unified governance.[^44]

Economic technocrats who worked with Suharto often praise his pragmatism and willingness to delegate economic policy to qualified experts. Unlike many developing country leaders who pursued ideologically driven economic experiments, Suharto allowed the Berkeley Mafia to implement sound macroeconomic policies. The fact that Indonesia avoided the debt crises that plagued Latin America in the 1980s is cited as evidence of competent economic management.[^45]

Some development economists argue that authoritarian developmental states like Suharto's Indonesia were necessary stages in economic modernization, pointing to similar patterns in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore. In this framework, political freedoms are luxuries that poor countries cannot afford while building the economic foundations for eventual democratization. The fact that Indonesia successfully transitioned to democracy after Suharto's fall is sometimes presented as vindication of this developmental sequencing.[^46]

Supporters within Indonesia, particularly among older generations who lived through the economic hardship of the early 1960s and enjoyed rising living standards under the New Order, remember Suharto's era with nostalgia. They emphasize stability, low crime rates, affordable food prices, and the ability to plan for the future. For these Indonesians, the chaos of the Sukarno era and the messy democratic politics since 1998 compare unfavorably to the predictability of Suharto's rule.[^47]

Military officers and security officials often defend Suharto's tough approach to separatism and communism, arguing that without his iron hand, Indonesia would have fragmented like Yugoslavia or descended into civil war. The preservation of territorial integrity and the crushing of the PKI are seen as essential acts of statecraft that saved the nation.[^48]

Some scholars emphasize that Suharto's regime was not uniformly repressive and allowed for significant social and cultural development within limits. The growth of civil society organizations, Islamic movements, and grassroots development initiatives during the New Order is cited as evidence that the regime was more complex than simple dictatorship. This nuanced view acknowledges repression while recognizing that Indonesian society continued to evolve under authoritarian rule.[^49]

In international relations scholarship, some analysts credit Suharto with creating regional stability through ASEAN and preventing Southeast Asia from becoming a Cold War battleground. His predictable, pro-Western orientation provided certainty for foreign investors and regional partners. The economic rise of Southeast Asia during his tenure is partially attributed to the stable regional environment he helped maintain.[^50]

Finally, some observers note that Suharto voluntarily resigned when faced with popular opposition in 1998, rather than attempting a violent suppression of protests or civil war. This decision to step down, even if motivated by recognition that his position was untenable, prevented even greater bloodshed and allowed for a relatively peaceful democratic transition.[^51]

### Negative Views

Critics and most contemporary scholars view Suharto as one of the 20th century's most destructive dictators, whose crimes vastly outweigh any economic achievements. The mass killings of 1965-66 constitute genocide or crimes against humanity by any reasonable standard, and Suharto's central role in orchestrating this violence disqualifies any positive legacy. The argument that economic development justified such atrocities is rejected as morally bankrupt.[^52]

Human rights organizations have extensively documented the systematic nature of repression under Suharto's New Order. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Indonesian organizations have compiled overwhelming evidence of torture, extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and political imprisonment throughout his rule. The occupation of East Timor alone involved crimes that international tribunals have characterized as crimes against humanity.[^53]

Economic historians increasingly question the "Indonesian miracle" narrative, pointing out that much of the celebrated growth was based on natural resource extraction, cheap labor, and unsustainable debt accumulation. The benefits were highly unequally distributed, with Suharto's family and cronies capturing a disproportionate share. The 1997-98 crisis revealed that the apparent economic success masked serious structural problems created by corruption and cronyism.[^54]

Political scientists criticize the argument that authoritarianism was necessary for development, noting that this claim has been used to justify dictatorships worldwide and that many authoritarian developmental states failed economically. The counter-examples of democratic developing countries like India and Botswana, which achieved growth without mass killings and dictatorship, undermine the necessity thesis. Additionally, the quality of development matters—growth that depends on repression and corruption creates unsustainable, fragile systems.[^55]

Scholars of Indonesian history emphasize that the transition to the New Order was not inevitable but rather the result of Suharto's political maneuvering and willingness to use mass violence. Alternative paths were possible in 1965-66, and the destruction of the PKI and left-wing civil society eliminated potentially more democratic and equitable development models. The Cold War context explains Western support for Suharto but does not justify his actions.[^56]

Environmental scientists and activists condemn Suharto's environmental record as catastrophic. The deforestation of Indonesia's rainforests, destruction of peatlands, and displacement of indigenous communities created ecological damage that undermines any positive economic legacy. Indonesia's current vulnerability to climate change and biodiversity loss stems directly from New Order policies that prioritized extraction and exploitation over sustainability.[^57]

Specialists on East Timor and Papua characterize Suharto's policies in these regions as colonialism and occupation comparable to the worst examples of 20th-century imperialism. The violence, cultural suppression, and resource extraction in these territories are seen as inexcusable crimes that the international community enabled through complicity and indifference.[^58]

Indonesian democracy activists and civil society leaders argue that Suharto's legacy of authoritarianism, corruption, and militarism continues to poison Indonesian politics. The oligarchic structures he created adapted to democratic conditions but remain obstacles to genuine reform. The culture of impunity established under the New Order persists, with few perpetrators of past atrocities facing justice. This incomplete transition hampers Indonesia's democratic consolidation.[^59]

Feminist scholars highlight the gendered dimensions of Suharto's repression, including the sexual violence used systematically against female political prisoners, the rape of Chinese Indonesian women during the 1998 riots that the military failed to prevent (or possibly facilitated), and the patriarchal state ideology that restricted women's roles. The regime's state feminism, while promoting some women's participation, ultimately reinforced conservative gender norms and family structures.[^60]

Global historians place Suharto in the context of Cold War dictatorships supported by Western powers despite their human rights abuses. His regime exemplifies how anti-communist ideology justified complicity in mass atrocities. Documents released in recent years show that American and Australian officials knew about the 1965-66 killings and the East Timor invasion while continuing to support Suharto militarily and diplomatically, raising profound questions about Western moral responsibility.[^61]

Finally, critics emphasize that Suharto never expressed remorse for any of his actions, never apologized to victims, and died without facing justice. His family retained much of its wealth, and many New Order officials continued to prosper in democratic Indonesia. This impunity represents a failure of transitional justice that continues to affect Indonesian society and politics.[^62]
