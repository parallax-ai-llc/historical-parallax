## Summary

Eugène Freyssinet is considered the father of prestressed concrete, developing the technique of pre-tensioning concrete with steel cables to greatly improve its structural performance. His innovations enabled longer bridge spans, thinner structures, and more efficient construction. Prestressed concrete became one of the most important materials in modern construction.
