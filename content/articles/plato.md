## Summary

Plato (428/427 – 348/347 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher, student of Socrates, teacher of Aristotle, and founder of the Academy in Athens—the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. Born into an aristocratic Athenian family, Plato witnessed his beloved teacher Socrates' execution (399 BC), which profoundly shaped his philosophy. He wrote approximately 36 dialogues featuring Socrates as protagonist, developing a comprehensive philosophical system addressing metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, politics, and aesthetics. His Theory of Forms—arguing that abstract, perfect Forms are more real than physical objects—became one of history's most influential philosophical ideas. Plato's *Republic* outlined an ideal state ruled by philosopher-kings, while his Academy educated thinkers for nearly 900 years. His influence on Western philosophy led Alfred North Whitehead to say that all subsequent philosophy consists of "footnotes to Plato."

## The Academy (387 BC)

**Foundation:**
- Established c. 387 BC in grove sacred to hero Academus
- First organized institution of higher learning
- Curriculum: mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, law
- Motto: "Let no one ignorant of geometry enter"
- Operated for 900 years until closed by Emperor Justinian (529 AD)

**Purpose:**
- Train future leaders and legislators
- Pursue truth through dialectical inquiry
- Study mathematics as path to Forms
- Notable student: Aristotle (studied there 20 years)

## Theory of Forms

**Central Doctrine:**

**Two Realms:**
1. **Realm of Forms** (intelligible world):
   - Eternal, unchanging, perfect archetypes
   - True reality
   - Accessible only through reason
   
2. **Physical World** (sensible world):
   - Imperfect copies of Forms
   - Constantly changing
   - Perceived through senses
   - Mere shadows of reality

**Examples:**
- **Form of the Good**: Highest Form, source of all other Forms
- **Mathematical Forms**: Perfect circle, triangle (physical circles imperfect approximations)
- **Moral Forms**: Form of Justice, Beauty, Courage
- **Form of the Bed**: Perfect "bed-ness" of which all physical beds are copies

**Allegory of the Cave** (*Republic*, Book VII):
- Prisoners chained in cave see only shadows
- Shadows are illusions cast by fire
- Philosopher escapes, sees real objects and sunlight (Forms and the Good)
- Returns to free others but is mocked/killed
- Represents human condition and philosopher's mission

**Epistemology:**
- True knowledge (episteme) concerns Forms
- Opinion (doxa) concerns physical world
- Soul remembers Forms from before birth (theory of recollection)
- Learning is remembering

## Political Philosophy (*Republic*)

**The Ideal State:**

**Three Classes** (corresponding to three parts of soul):
1. **Guardians/Rulers** (Philosopher-Kings):
   - Reason governs
   - Love wisdom above all
   - No private property or family
   - Rule not for power but duty
   
2. **Auxiliaries** (Warriors):
   - Spirit/courage
   - Protect state
   - Obey Guardians
   
3. **Producers** (Farmers, Craftsmen):
   - Appetite/desire
   - Provide economic needs
   - Limited political voice

**Justice:**
- Each class performs its proper function
- Justice is harmony of three classes (like harmonious soul)

**Education:**
- Extensive training for Guardians
- Mathematics, dialectics, philosophy
- Study of Forms culminating in Form of the Good
- Only philosophers fit to rule (have knowledge, not mere opinion)

**Controversies:**
- Totalitarian aspects (censorship, lying for state's benefit)
- Communism for Guardians
- Eugenics (selective breeding)
- Criticized by Aristotle and many others

---

## Psychology

**Tripartite Soul:**
1. **Reason** (logistikon): Seeks truth, should rule
2. **Spirit** (thumos): Emotions, honor, courage
3. **Appetite** (epithumia): Physical desires

**Justice in Individual:**
- Reason governs spirit and appetite
- Harmony between three parts
- Virtues correspond to parts:
  - Wisdom (reason)
  - Courage (spirit)
  - Temperance (appetite controlled)
  - Justice (all three harmonious)

**Immortality of Soul** (*Phaedo*):
- Soul existed before birth
- Survives death
- Multiple arguments for immortality
- Reincarnation based on previous life's virtue

---

## Epistemology

**Divided Line** (*Republic*, Book VI):
From less to more real:
1. **Images** (shadows, reflections) - imagination
2. **Physical Objects** - belief
3. **Mathematical Objects** - thought
4. **Forms** - understanding/knowledge

**Dialectic:**
- Philosophical dialogue ascending to Forms
- Socratic method refined
- Questions and answers reveal truth
- Culminates in direct apprehension of Forms

---

## Major Dialogues

**Early** (Socratic dialogues):
- *Apology*: Socrates' defense at trial
- *Crito*: Why Socrates refused escape
- *Euthyphro*: Nature of piety

**Middle** (Theory of Forms developed):
- *Phaedo*: Immortality of soul, death of Socrates
- *Symposium*: Nature of love
- *Republic*: Justice, ideal state, Forms
- *Phaedrus*: Love, rhetoric, soul

**Late** (Critical self-examination):
- *Parmenides*: Criticizes Theory of Forms
- *Theaetetus*: Nature of knowledge
- *Sophist*: Being and non-being
- *Timaeus*: Cosmology, creation myth
- *Laws*: Practical legislation (less ideal than *Republic*)

---

## Influence and Legacy

**Philosophy:**
- Founded Western idealism
- Influenced Neoplatonism, Christianity, Islamic philosophy
- Shaped conception of abstract reality
- Model for systematic philosophy

**Christianity:**
- Church Fathers (Augustine) incorporated Platonic ideas
- Forms became Divine Ideas in God's mind
- Immortal soul doctrine
- Separation of spiritual and material

**Science:**
- Emphasized mathematics as key to reality
- Inspired later mathematical physics
- Though empirical science rejected Forms

**Politics:**
- Influenced utopian thinking
- Criticized for totalitarian implications
- Ideal of philosopher-rulers recurs
