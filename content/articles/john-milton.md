## Summary

John Milton (1608-1674) was an English poet, polemicist, and intellectual who is widely regarded as one of the greatest writers in the English language and one of the most significant figures of the English Revolution. He is best known for his epic poem *Paradise Lost*, which reimagined the biblical story of the Fall of Man and established him as a literary giant comparable to Homer, Virgil, and Dante. Beyond his literary achievements, Milton was a passionate political activist who served as Latin Secretary under Oliver Cromwell's Commonwealth government and wrote influential tracts defending republicanism, freedom of the press, and divorce reform. His life spanned one of the most tumultuous periods in English history, and his works continue to shape Western literature, political thought, and theological debate.

## Early Life and Background

John Milton was born on December 9, 1608, in Bread Street, Cheapside, London, to John Milton Sr., a prosperous scrivener and composer, and Sarah Jeffrey.[^1] His father's success in business and music provided the family with considerable wealth, allowing young Milton to receive an exceptional education that would shape his intellectual development. The elder Milton was a Protestant convert who had been disinherited by his Catholic father, an experience that likely influenced the family's strong Puritan convictions.[^2]

Milton's early education began at home with private tutors, where he demonstrated extraordinary intellectual gifts and developed a voracious appetite for learning. From a young age, he was known to study until midnight or later, a habit that may have contributed to his later blindness.[^3] In 1620, at age twelve, he entered St. Paul's School in London, one of England's finest educational institutions, where he studied under the renowned headmaster Alexander Gil and was exposed to classical languages, literature, and humanist learning.[^4]

His intellectual prowess continued to flourish at Christ's College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1625. At Cambridge, Milton earned the nickname "the Lady of Christ's" due to his fair complexion, delicate features, and refined manner, though this apparently mocking epithet did not diminish his academic standing.[^5] He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1629 and his Master of Arts in 1632, excelling particularly in classical languages, rhetoric, and theology.[^6] During his university years, Milton began writing poetry in both Latin and English, producing works such as "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity" (1629), which already displayed his remarkable command of language and complex theological ideas.

After leaving Cambridge, Milton did not immediately pursue a career in the Church of England, as was expected of someone with his education, largely because he found the ecclesiastical establishment too hierarchical and corrupt.[^7] Instead, he returned to his family's estates, first at Hammersmith and then at Horton in Buckinghamshire, where he embarked on an intensive six-year period of self-directed study (1632-1638). During this time, he read extensively in classical and modern literature, philosophy, theology, and history, preparing himself for what he believed would be a great literary calling. This period produced some of his most celebrated early poems, including "L'Allegro," "Il Penseroso," the masque *Comus* (1634), and the pastoral elegy "Lycidas" (1638).[^8]

## Rise to Prominence

Milton's rise to prominence occurred in two distinct but interconnected spheres: literary and political. His early reputation was established through his poetry, but his true celebrity came through his controversial political and religious writings during the English Civil War period.

In 1638-1639, Milton embarked on a continental tour, primarily to Italy, which was the customary "Grand Tour" for educated young Englishmen of means.[^9] He traveled through France to Italy, where he visited Florence, Rome, and Naples, meeting prominent intellectuals including the aged astronomer Galileo Galilei, who was under house arrest by the Inquisition—an encounter that would deeply influence Milton's thinking about freedom of thought and ecclesiastical tyranny.[^10] He had planned to extend his travels to Sicily and Greece, but news of the brewing political crisis in England caused him to return home in 1639, later writing that he "thought it base to be traveling for amusement abroad, while my fellow-citizens were fighting for liberty at home."[^11]

Upon his return to England, as tensions escalated between King Charles I and Parliament, Milton established himself in London and began taking private pupils, including his nephews John and Edward Phillips.[^12] However, the political upheaval soon drew him into public controversy. Between 1641 and 1660, Milton largely abandoned poetry to devote himself to prose pamphlets addressing the religious and political crises of the day. His first major intervention came with his anti-episcopal tracts (1641-1642), including *Of Reformation* and *The Reason of Church Government*, which attacked the hierarchical structure of the Church of England and advocated for Presbyterian church governance.[^13]

Milton's reputation as a controversial radical was cemented by his divorce tracts, written following his disastrous marriage to Mary Powell in 1642. When his seventeen-year-old bride left him after only a few weeks, Milton produced a series of pamphlets arguing for divorce on grounds of incompatibility, not merely adultery or desertion as the law allowed.[^14] Works such as *The Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce* (1643) scandalized contemporary society and brought Milton both notoriety and condemnation from Parliament and the Presbyterian clergy.[^15]

His most influential work of this period, and arguably his most important prose work, was *Areopagitica* (1644), a passionate defense of freedom of the press written in response to Parliament's Licensing Order of 1643, which required government approval before publication.[^16] In this eloquent tract, Milton articulated principles of free speech and the marketplace of ideas that would influence liberal political thought for centuries, famously declaring, "Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties."[^17]

Milton's political career reached its apex when he was appointed Latin Secretary to the Council of State in 1649, shortly after the execution of Charles I.[^18] In this role, he served as the Commonwealth's chief propagandist and diplomatic correspondent, composing state papers in Latin (the international language of diplomacy) and defending the regicide and republican government in works such as *The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates* (1649) and *Eikonoklastes* (1649), a response to the royalist *Eikon Basilike*.[^19] His *Defensio pro Populo Anglicano* (First Defence, 1651), written in response to the continental scholar Salmasius's attack on the English Revolution, brought Milton international fame—and infamy—as the learned defender of the revolutionary regime.[^20]

## Major Achievements

Milton's major achievements span both his political prose and his monumental poetic works, representing some of the highest accomplishments in English literature and political thought.

In the realm of political philosophy, Milton's contributions to the theory of religious liberty, freedom of expression, and republicanism were groundbreaking for his time. *Areopagitica* remains one of the most powerful defenses of free speech ever written, arguing that truth emerges through open debate and that censorship is both ineffective and morally wrong.[^21] His argument that "books are not absolutely dead things, but do contain a potency of life in them" and that "a good book is the precious life-blood of a master spirit" elevated the status of intellectual freedom to a sacred principle.[^22] Though his views were not consistently libertarian by modern standards—he excluded Catholics and advocated censorship of "popery and open superstition"—his principles laid groundwork for Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke and John Stuart Mill.[^23]

His regicide tracts, particularly *The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates* and his Defences, articulated a radical theory of popular sovereignty and the right of people to remove tyrannical rulers.[^24] Writing in the immediate aftermath of Charles I's execution, Milton argued that kings derive their authority from the people and can be deposed when they violate the social contract—ideas that would resonate in later revolutionary movements, including the American and French Revolutions.[^25]

Milton's divorce tracts, though controversial and largely unsuccessful in changing law during his lifetime, represented pioneering thinking about marriage as a companionate relationship based on intellectual and spiritual compatibility rather than merely a legal or property arrangement.[^26] His argument that "a meet and happy conversation is the chiefest and noblest end of marriage" challenged traditional patriarchal and religious conceptions of matrimony.[^27]

However, Milton's supreme achievement, and the work for which he is most celebrated, is his epic poem *Paradise Lost*, published in 1667 after years of composition during which he was completely blind.[^28] This monumental work of over 10,000 lines of blank verse retells the biblical story of the Fall of Man, from Satan's rebellion against God through the temptation of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from Eden. The poem is remarkable for its linguistic grandeur, psychological complexity, theological depth, and ambiguous treatment of its characters, particularly Satan, who emerges as one of literature's most compelling anti-heroes.[^29]

*Paradise Lost* revolutionized English poetry through its use of blank verse for epic poetry (previously, English epics had used rhyme), its Latinate syntax and vocabulary, and its sublime style that sought to "justify the ways of God to men" while grappling with profound questions of free will, theodicy, and the nature of evil.[^30] The poem's influence on subsequent English and world literature can hardly be overstated, shaping the works of countless poets, novelists, and thinkers from William Blake and Mary Shelley to C.S. Lewis and Philip Pullman.[^31]

Milton followed *Paradise Lost* with *Paradise Regained* (1671), a brief epic focused on Christ's temptation in the wilderness, which presents a very different heroic ideal centered on patience and renunciation rather than martial valor.[^32] Published in the same volume was *Samson Agonistes*, a dramatic poem in the style of Greek tragedy that tells the story of the biblical Samson and has been read by many scholars as an allegory of Milton's own experience of political defeat and blindness.[^33]

Beyond these masterpieces, Milton's earlier poetry includes gems of English verse such as "Lycidas," considered one of the finest pastoral elegies in the language; the companion poems "L'Allegro" and "Il Penseroso," which explore the contrasting pleasures of mirth and contemplation; and his sonnets, which adapted the Italian form to English and addressed both personal and political themes with remarkable compression and power.[^34]

Milton's *De Doctrina Christiana* (On Christian Doctrine), a systematic theology discovered and published only in 1825, revealed the extent of his heterodox religious views, including his rejection of the Trinity, his belief in mortalism (the idea that the soul dies with the body until resurrection), and his subordination of the Son to the Father—positions that would have been considered heretical by both Protestant and Catholic orthodoxy.[^35] This work demonstrated Milton's fearless intellectual independence and willingness to follow his reading of Scripture even when it led him to radical conclusions.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Milton's life and works have been subject to substantial controversy, both in his own time and subsequently. His political activities during the Interregnum made him a target of fierce criticism and genuine danger after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660.

As a defender of regicide and the Commonwealth government, Milton was considered a traitor by royalists and faced potential execution when the monarchy was restored.[^36] He went into hiding and his books were publicly burned by the hangman. Only through the intervention of friends, possibly including the poet Andrew Marvell, and perhaps some bribery, was Milton's name removed from the list of those exempted from pardon, allowing him to avoid execution or lengthy imprisonment, though he was briefly jailed and financially ruined by fines.[^37]

Milton's divorce tracts brought him condemnation from multiple quarters, with both Presbyterian clergy and Parliament denouncing his views as licentious and dangerous to social order.[^38] The Westminster Assembly considered bringing charges against him, though these were never pursued.[^39] Even many who supported Parliament in the Civil War found his positions on marriage shockingly radical and potentially subversive of family and social hierarchy.

His religious heterodoxy, particularly his anti-Trinitarianism, was discovered in *De Doctrina Christiana* long after his death, leading to shocked reassessments of his theology and prompting questions about how his heretical views might have shaped his poetry.[^40] Some scholars have argued that had these views been known during his lifetime, Milton might have faced charges of heresy.[^41]

Milton's views on women and gender have been extensively criticized by modern scholars and readers, particularly feminists who note the patriarchal assumptions throughout his work. In *Paradise Lost*, despite some moments where Eve demonstrates intelligence and agency, the overall structure reinforces traditional gender hierarchy, with Adam described as "for God only" while Eve is "for God in him," and the Fall often attributed primarily to Eve's weakness and vanity.[^42] His divorce tracts, while innovative in some respects, assume male superiority and primarily consider divorce from the husband's perspective.[^43]

His treatment of his daughters has also drawn criticism. After becoming blind, Milton required readers and amanuenses to help him compose his later works, and he reportedly trained his daughters to read languages they did not understand so they could recite texts to him—a use of their labor that some biographers have characterized as exploitative, especially given that he apparently did not provide them with substantial education or inheritance.[^44]

Milton's political writings contained views that are disturbing by modern standards, including his support for limited religious toleration that explicitly excluded Catholics and his defense of the English conquest of Ireland.[^45] While he opposed censorship in *Areopagitica*, this opposition did not extend to "popery and open superstition," revealing the limits of his liberal principles.[^46]

The political ambiguity and apparent sympathy for Satan in *Paradise Lost* has been a subject of controversy since the Romantic period. William Blake famously declared that Milton was "of the Devil's party without knowing it," suggesting that the poet's sympathies lay more with the rebellious Satan than with the authoritarian God.[^47] This interpretation has been debated by scholars, with some arguing it reflects Milton's own revolutionary sympathies and others contending it simply demonstrates his dramatic skill in creating a compelling antagonist.[^48]

Some scholars have also criticized Milton's elitism and his apparent contempt for ordinary people, evident in works like *The Readie and Easie Way to Establish a Free Commonwealth* (1660), where he proposed that a small educated elite should govern, suggesting an aristocratic republicanism rather than democracy.[^49] His reference to the "inconsiderate multitude" and fear of mob rule has led critics to question his commitment to genuine popular sovereignty.[^50]

## Personal Life

John Milton's personal life was marked by both tragedy and triumph, shaped by three marriages, troubled family relationships, and the profound challenge of blindness.

Milton married Mary Powell in 1642, when he was thirty-three and she was seventeen.[^51] The marriage was disastrous from the start; Mary came from a Royalist family, creating political tension, and she left Milton after only a few weeks to return to her family's home in Oxfordshire.[^52] This abandonment prompted Milton to write his controversial divorce tracts. However, the couple reconciled in 1645, possibly due to the Powell family's financial difficulties and the changing fortunes of the Civil War.[^53] Mary bore Milton four children—Anne (1646), Mary (1648), John (1651), and Deborah (1652)—before dying in 1652, shortly after the birth of Deborah. The infant John also died, leaving Milton a widower with three young daughters.[^54]

In 1656, Milton married Katherine Woodcock, who was in her twenties.[^55] This marriage appears to have been happy, but it was tragically brief. Katherine died in February 1658, shortly after giving birth to a daughter who also died. Milton memorialized his second wife in one of his most moving sonnets, "Methought I saw my late espoused saint," though some scholars debate whether this sonnet refers to Katherine or to Mary Powell.[^56]

Milton's third marriage, to Elizabeth Minshull in 1663, when he was fifty-four and she was twenty-four, lasted until his death and by most accounts was harmonious, with Elizabeth caring for the aging and blind poet.[^57] Unlike his earlier wives, Elizabeth survived him by many years and provided important testimony about his final years to his early biographers.[^58]

Milton's relationship with his daughters, particularly the elder two, Anne and Mary, appears to have been strained. Early biographers reported that they resented being used as readers and servants for their father, that they sold some of his books, and that they may have spoken of him with bitterness.[^59] However, some modern scholars question the reliability of these accounts, suggesting they may have been exaggerated by biographers with particular agendas.[^60] Milton did not leave his daughters substantial inheritances, leaving the bulk of his estate to Elizabeth, which caused family disputes.[^61]

The defining physical challenge of Milton's later life was his progressive blindness, which was complete by 1652 when he was forty-three years old.[^62] The exact cause remains debated—possibilities include glaucoma, retinal detachment, or other conditions—but the psychological and practical impact was enormous.[^63] Milton addressed his blindness in several sonnets, most notably "When I consider how my light is spent," where he grappled with anxiety about whether he could continue to serve God without his sight, concluding with the famous line "They also serve who only stand and wait."[^64]

Despite his blindness, Milton continued his literary work through dictation, composing *Paradise Lost*, *Paradise Regained*, and *Samson Agonistes* entirely without sight, an extraordinary achievement that rivals Homer's legendary blindness and that Milton himself invoked in the opening of Book III of *Paradise Lost*.[^65] He required readers and amanuenses, including his daughters, Andrew Marvell, and various young men who assisted him, to whom he would dictate verses that he had composed in his mind, often producing as many as forty lines overnight.[^66]

Contemporary descriptions of Milton's personality vary. Some portrayed him as stern, doctrinaire, and difficult, while others emphasized his learning, conversational ability, and kindness to students.[^67] His nephew Edward Phillips, who studied under him and later wrote a biography, depicted him as a demanding but effective teacher.[^68] Milton appears to have been deeply learned, multilingual (fluent in Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, French, and Spanish), and possessed of remarkable memory, which became even more crucial after he lost his sight.[^69]

Milton lived modestly in his later years, residing in various London locations including Bunhill Fields, where he composed his greatest works in relative obscurity during the Restoration, a defeated republican in a restored monarchy.[^70] He died on November 8, 1674, likely from complications of gout, and was buried beside his father in St. Giles Church, Cripplegate.[^71]

## Legacy

John Milton's legacy is multifaceted and enduring, extending across literature, political thought, theology, and cultural influence. He stands as one of the towering figures of English and world literature, and his impact continues to resonate more than three centuries after his death.

In the literary sphere, Milton's influence on English poetry is incalculable. *Paradise Lost* established a new standard for epic poetry in English and demonstrated the power of blank verse for extended narrative, influencing virtually every major English poet who followed. The Romantic poets—Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, and Byron—all engaged deeply with Milton's work, sometimes in admiration, sometimes in rebellion.[^72] The twentieth century saw continued Miltonic influence in poets like T.S. Eliot (despite his personal ambivalence about Milton) and Seamus Heaney, who translated classical epics while explicitly acknowledging Milton's mediating influence.[^73]

Milton's impact extends far beyond poetry into prose fiction. Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* uses *Paradise Lost* as a central intertext, with the creature reading the poem and identifying with Satan.[^74] Philip Pullman's *His Dark Materials* trilogy represents an extended engagement with and reinterpretation of Milton's epic, deliberately inverting its theology.[^75] C.S. Lewis's *Perelandra* rewrites the temptation story in a science fiction setting, while his critical work *A Preface to Paradise Lost* shaped mid-twentieth-century Milton scholarship.[^76]

In political philosophy, Milton's influence on liberal thought is profound, though often indirect. His arguments for freedom of expression in *Areopagitica* anticipated and influenced Enlightenment thinkers, particularly John Locke, whose *Two Treatises of Government* echoes Miltonic ideas about popular sovereignty and the right to resist tyranny.[^77] The American founding fathers knew Milton's political works, and his republican ideas contributed to revolutionary ideology in both America and France.[^78] John Adams quoted Milton, and Thomas Jefferson recommended his works.[^79]

The concept of freedom of the press and the "marketplace of ideas" owes much to Milton's eloquent defense in *Areopagitica*, even though his actual position was more qualified than later liberal interpreters sometimes acknowledge.[^80] Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis cited Milton in his famous defense of free speech, and the work continues to be invoked in debates about censorship and intellectual freedom.[^81]

Milton's theological legacy is more contested. His heterodox views, particularly his anti-Trinitarianism, were largely unknown until the nineteenth century, and when discovered, they created consternation among those who had claimed Milton as an orthodox Protestant champion.[^82] However, his theological writings and the theological dimensions of his poetry have influenced religious thinkers across the spectrum, from evangelical Christians who appreciate his biblical focus to liberal theologians interested in his emphasis on individual conscience and interpretation.[^83]

The figure of Milton's Satan has had an extraordinary cultural afterlife, shaping representations of the Devil, anti-heroes, and rebels in Western culture. The Romantic conception of the "Byronic hero"—proud, defiant, psychologically complex—owes much to Milton's Satan.[^84] The character has been analyzed from countless perspectives: political (as revolutionary or as tyrant), psychological (as narcissist or as freedom fighter), and theological (as embodiment of evil or as tragic hero).[^85]

Milton's reputation and critical assessment have fluctuated over the centuries. The eighteenth century generally revered him, with Joseph Addison's *Spectator* essays popularizing *Paradise Lost* and establishing Milton as a national poet comparable to the classical epic poets.[^86] The Romantics complicated this reception, admiring Milton's power while sometimes questioning his theology and politics.[^87]

The twentieth century saw intense scholarly debate about Milton's value. T.S. Eliot and F.R. Leavis famously criticized Milton's style as artificial and his influence on English poetry as pernicious, arguing that his Latinate syntax and elevated diction led poetry away from living speech.[^88] However, defenders like C.S. Lewis and Christopher Ricks argued for Milton's technical mastery and the appropriateness of his grand style to his epic themes.[^89]

Feminist criticism from the 1970s onward has challenged Milton's treatment of gender, leading to sophisticated debates about whether *Paradise Lost* simply reinforces patriarchy or whether it contains subversive elements and complexities that complicate easy readings.[^90] Critics like Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar analyzed how later women writers responded to Milton's gender ideology, while scholars like Christine Froula explored the poem's sexual politics.[^91]

Postcolonial criticism has examined Milton's attitudes toward empire, race, and cultural difference, producing new readings of his political works and of passages in *Paradise Lost* dealing with exploration, conquest, and otherness.[^92] These approaches have made Milton studies more global and historically nuanced.

In popular culture, Milton's influence persists, though often mediated and transformed. His portrayal of Hell and Satan has shaped countless films, novels, and artworks. References to *Paradise Lost* appear in works ranging from Herman Melville's *Moby-Dick* to contemporary science fiction and fantasy.[^93] The phrase "Paradise Lost" itself has become proverbial, applied to everything from environmental destruction to lost innocence.

Educational institutions have honored Milton extensively. Numerous colleges, schools, and libraries bear his name, and his works remain central to English literature curricula worldwide. Milton studies constitutes a significant subfield of literary scholarship, with dedicated journals, societies, and regular international conferences.[^94]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and critical admiration for Milton spans centuries and encompasses multiple dimensions of his achievement. Samuel Johnson, despite personal reservations about Milton's politics and theology, famously acknowledged in *Lives of the Poets* that *Paradise Lost* was a work of unparalleled grandeur, noting that Milton "wrote no language" but rather created a distinctive poetic idiom of sublime power.[^95] Johnson's assessment, though mixed, recognized that Milton had achieved something extraordinary in English literature.

The Romantic poets elevated Milton to heroic status, particularly celebrating his political radicalism and poetic ambition. William Wordsworth declared Milton's soul was "like a star and dwelt apart" in his famous sonnet "London, 1802," invoking Milton as a moral exemplar whose "soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart."[^96] Percy Bysshe Shelley, in his *Defence of Poetry*, praised Milton's Satan as a magnificent creation and Milton himself as a champion of liberty who dared to imagine "things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme."[^97]

Twentieth-century defenders of Milton, particularly the critic C.S. Lewis in *A Preface to Paradise Lost*, argued powerfully for the theological and artistic coherence of Milton's epic, contending that modern readers who sympathized with Satan were simply misreading the poem and that Milton successfully portrayed both the seductive appeal and the ultimate emptiness of Satanic rebellion.[^98] Lewis's reading, though now considered somewhat reductive, provided a sophisticated theological defense of Milton's vision.

The scholar Christopher Ricks, in *Milton's Grand Style*, offered a brilliant defense of Milton's poetic technique against modernist critics like Eliot and Leavis, demonstrating through close reading how Milton's apparently artificial syntax and diction created precise effects and profound meanings.[^99] Ricks showed that what seemed like excessive Latinate construction was actually carefully controlled artistry serving thematic purposes.

Stanley Fish, in *Surprised by Sin*, argued that *Paradise Lost* is deliberately constructed to implicate readers in the fall, making us experience the seductions of Satanic rhetoric so that we understand temptation from within—a reading that elevated Milton's psychological and pedagogical sophistication.[^100] Fish's approach emphasized Milton's artistry as a teacher who shapes reader response through formal techniques.

Historians of political thought have increasingly recognized Milton's contributions to republican theory and liberty. Quentin Skinner and other scholars of early modern political thought have situated Milton within the classical republican tradition, showing how his arguments about freedom, self-governance, and resistance to tyranny drew on ancient sources while adapting them to revolutionary circumstances.[^101] Milton emerges in these accounts as a serious political philosopher, not merely a polemicist.

Barbara Lewalski's magisterial biography *The Life of John Milton* presented Milton as a figure of extraordinary intellectual courage and creative achievement, emphasizing his principled stands on controversial issues and his ability to produce sublime art even in the face of political defeat and physical blindness.[^102] Lewalski's scholarship has been particularly important in establishing Milton's centrality to early modern English culture and thought.

Scholars of toleration and freedom of expression consistently cite Milton's *Areopagitica* as a landmark text. Though acknowledging its limitations, historians of ideas recognize that Milton articulated principles about the value of intellectual freedom, the dangers of censorship, and the importance of debate that became foundational to liberal political theory.[^103] His metaphor of truth and falsehood grappling in free and open encounter remains powerful and influential.

Recent scholarship has also highlighted Milton's learning and intellectual range. Readers have noted his profound engagement with classical literature, patristic theology, Renaissance humanism, and contemporary science (including his meeting with Galileo).[^104] Milton emerges as one of the last great Renaissance polymaths, whose command of multiple languages, literary traditions, and fields of knowledge informed his creative achievement.

Admirers of Milton's poetry consistently emphasize its sonic power, its capacity to create sublime effects through rhythm, sound, and syntax. His blank verse is recognized as perhaps the most accomplished in English, capable of extraordinary flexibility, from the thunderous rhetoric of Satan's speeches to the tender intimacy of Adam and Eve's conversations before the fall.[^105]

### Negative Views

Criticism of Milton has been equally vigorous and multifaceted. The most influential twentieth-century attack came from T.S. Eliot, who in essays such as "Milton I" and "Milton II" argued that Milton's influence on English poetry had been largely pernicious.[^106] Eliot claimed that Milton's grand style, with its Latinate syntax and elaborate artifice, led poetry away from the rhythms of living speech and created an unfortunate model that subsequent poets followed to the detriment of English verse.[^107] Though Eliot later moderated his views somewhat, his criticism shaped mid-century attitudes toward Milton.

F.R. Leavis extended and intensified Eliot's critique in essays and in *Revaluation*, arguing that Milton's poetry exhibited a "callousness to the intrinsic nature of English" and that his verse was more concerned with sonorous grandeur than with precise meaning or felt experience.[^108] Leavis influentially argued that Milton should be removed from the central canon of English poetry, a position that sparked extensive scholarly debate.

Feminist scholars have mounted sustained critiques of Milton's gender politics. Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar, in *The Madwoman in the Attic*, argued that Milton's portrayal of Eve established a paradigm of female subordination and secondary creation that profoundly influenced subsequent literature and culture.[^109] They contended that Milton's Eve, created from Adam's rib and "for God in him," embodied a patriarchal ideology that women writers have had to struggle against for centuries.

Christine Froula's influential essay "When Eve Reads Milton" analyzed how Milton's epic participates in and perpetuates what she called a "patriarchal literary tradition" that marginalizes women's voices and perspectives.[^110] She argued that the poem's structure fundamentally privileges male authority and that even apparently sympathetic moments in the portrayal of Eve ultimately reinforce her subordination.

Mary Nyquist and others have examined the troubling politics of gender in Milton's divorce tracts, noting that despite their innovative elements, these works assume male superiority and primarily consider divorce from the husband's perspective, with the wife's incompatibility defined largely by her failure to provide adequate intellectual companionship to her husband.[^111] The tracts, in this view, reflect Milton's assumption that marriage exists primarily for male fulfillment.

Critics of Milton's politics have noted authoritarian and elitist elements in his political thought. His proposals in *The Readie and Easie Way* for a "perpetual senate" of the educated few to govern England have been read as revealing an aristocratic republicanism incompatible with genuine democracy.[^112] His contemptuous references to the "rabble" and his fear of mob rule suggest, to these critics, that Milton's commitment to liberty extended primarily to people like himself—educated, property-owning men.[^113]

William Empson, in *Milton's God*, mounted a provocative critique of the theology of *Paradise Lost*, arguing that the God depicted in the poem is actually a tyrannical bully and that Milton, perhaps unconsciously, revealed the moral bankruptcy of orthodox Christianity.[^114] Empson contended that readers rightly sympathize with Satan because God's arbitrary power and harsh punishments are genuinely unjust, and that the poem inadvertently exposes rather than justifies divine ways.

Scholars have also criticized Milton's treatment of Catholicism and his anti-Catholic bigotry, which was virulent even by seventeenth-century Protestant standards. His exclusion of Catholics from toleration and his inflammatory rhetoric about "popery" reveal prejudices that modern readers find troubling.[^115] Similarly, his support for English colonialism in Ireland and his apparent acceptance of aggressive Protestant imperialism have been criticized by postcolonial scholars.[^116]

Some readers and scholars have found Milton's theology in *Paradise Lost* to be incoherent or contradictory, particularly regarding free will and predestination. How can Adam and Eve be truly free if God is omniscient and omnipotent? How can their fall be fortunate if it results in eternal damnation for many? These theological puzzles have led some critics to see the poem as philosophically confused rather than profound.[^117]

Biographical critics have sometimes portrayed Milton unfavorably based on his personal relationships, particularly his treatment of his daughters and his apparent harshness as a father and teacher. Though some of these accounts may be exaggerated or unreliable, they have contributed to a portrait of Milton as cold, demanding, and self-absorbed.[^118]

Political historians have noted that Milton's actual political effectiveness was limited and that some of his political writings, particularly his defenses of the Commonwealth regime, defended positions and actions (such as the conquest of Ireland) that we now recognize as morally problematic.[^119] His work as a propagandist for a military dictatorship complicates his image as a champion of liberty.

Some critics have argued that *Paradise Lost* is essentially unreadable for modern audiences, that its theological framework is alien to contemporary readers, and that its length, difficulty, and assumptions make it more admired than actually read and enjoyed.[^120] Harold Bloom, while acknowledging Milton's stature, suggested that his influence might ultimately prove stifling rather than enabling for subsequent poets.[^121]
