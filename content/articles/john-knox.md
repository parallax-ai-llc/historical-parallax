## Summary

John Knox (c. 1514 – 24 November 1572) was a Scottish minister, Reformed theologian, and writer who led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland. As the foremost leader of the Scottish Reformation, Knox set the austere moral tone of the Church of Scotland and shaped the democratic Presbyterian form of government it adopted[^1]. His powerful preaching, theological writings, and uncompromising stance against Catholic monarchs transformed Scotland's religious landscape forever. Knox's influence extended far beyond Scotland, establishing Presbyterianism as a major Protestant denomination and contributing to theories of resistance against tyrannical rulers that would later influence democratic movements worldwide[^2].

---

## Early Life and Background

John Knox was born sometime between 1505 and 1515 in or near Haddington, the county town of East Lothian, Scotland[^3]. His father, William Knox, was a merchant, and his mother's maiden name was Sinclair; she died when John Knox was a child[^4]. Knox was probably educated at the grammar school in Haddington, his first school being that of the Church of St Mary, Haddington, where he learned to read and write[^5].

Knox is believed to have been educated at the University of St Andrews, where he studied rhetoric—for which he was afterward so famed—and canon law, to enable him to maintain a suitable profession[^6]. One of Knox's most influential tutors was John Mair, who advocated the power of General Councils over that of the Pope, an idea that would later influence Knox's own ecclesiastical thinking[^7]. Knox was ordained as a Catholic priest at Easter 1536, and in 1543, he became an apostolic notary, serving as a Church official responsible for drafting official Church documents[^8].

The real turning point in Knox's early life came in 1543, when he was hired as a tutor to the sons of two East Lothian gentlemen, which brought him into contact with Protestant ideas[^9]. Influenced by early church reformers such as George Wishart, Knox joined the movement to reform the Scottish Church[^10]. He was converted by Wishart sometime around 1543, and when Wishart traveled throughout Scotland preaching in favor of the Reformation in East Lothian, Knox became one of his closest associates and acted as his bodyguard, bearing a two-handed sword to defend him[^11].

In December 1543, the regent for the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, along with the Queen Mother Mary of Guise and Cardinal David Beaton, decided to persecute the Protestant sect in Scotland[^12]. In December 1545, Wishart was seized on Beaton's orders by the Earl of Bothwell and taken to the Castle of St Andrews. On 1 March 1546, Wishart was burnt at the stake in the presence of Beaton, an event that profoundly affected Knox and solidified his commitment to the Protestant cause[^13].

---

## Rise to Power

After George Wishart's martyrdom in 1546, Protestant nobles murdered Cardinal David Beaton and seized St. Andrews Castle[^14]. In 1547, Knox was called to preach by Chaplain John Rough and preached his first sermon in the parish church of St. Andrews Castle, marking the beginning of his career as a reformer[^15]. However, in June 1547, a French fleet under Leo Strozzi appeared before St. Andrews to assist in the reduction of the castle, and after a brave resistance, the besieged were forced to capitulate on July 31st[^16].

The capitulation was violated, and the Protestant nobles and others, including Knox, were taken prisoner and forced to row in the French galleys at the solicitation of the pope and Scottish clergy[^17]. Knox, with a few others, was confined on board the galleys; in addition to the rigors of ordinary captivity, he was loaded with chains and exposed to all the indignities with which Papists were accustomed to treat those whom they regarded as heretics[^18]. The galley slaves were chained to benches and rowed throughout the day without a change of posture while an officer watched over them with a whip in hand[^19]. In mid-1548, the galleys returned to Scotland to scout for English ships, and Knox's health was now at its lowest point due to the severity of his confinement—he was ill with a fever and others on the ship were afraid for his life[^20].

In February 1549, after spending a total of 19 months in the galley-prison, Knox was released, probably through the influence of England, now ruled by the Protestant Edward VI[^21]. Released early in 1549, Knox made his way to England and became a licensed preacher, first at Berwick, then at Newcastle, and finally in London, where he was one of the six chaplains to the young King, Edward VI[^22]. In England, Knox became a popular preacher, was associated with Thomas Cranmer, revised the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, and rose in the ranks to serve as a royal chaplain to King Edward VI of England[^23].

Edward's successor, Mary Tudor, re-established Roman Catholicism in England and restored the Mass in all the churches. With the country no longer safe for Protestant preachers, Knox left for the Continent in January 1554 on the advice of friends[^24]. Knox disembarked in Dieppe, France, and continued to Geneva, where John Calvin had established his authority[^25]. His principal place of sojourn was that "perfect school of Christ," Calvin's Geneva, where he became a close associate of John Calvin and adopted much of his theology as well as that of Heinrich Bullinger, who had influenced Calvin[^26]. In Geneva, Knox led a busy life, preaching three sermons a week, each lasting well over two hours[^27].

## Major Achievements

### Leadership of the Scottish Reformation

John Knox was the foremost leader of the Scottish Reformation, who set the austere moral tone of the Church of Scotland and shaped the democratic form of government it adopted[^28]. Knox led the Protestant Reformation in Scotland in partnership with the Scottish Protestant nobility, transforming the religious landscape of the nation[^29]. In 1559, Knox returned to Scotland, and his preaching triggered a Protestant rebellion against Mary of Guise[^30]. His powerful sermons attracted large crowds and ignited a widespread movement for reform throughout Scotland[^31].

### Establishment of Presbyterianism

Knox was notable for assuring the replacement of the established Christian religion with Presbyterianism rather than Anglicanism[^32]. He is famous for establishing the Presbyterian Church of Scotland, rejecting the papacy and distrusting having a monarch rule the church[^33]. The building blocks and general vision of presbyterianism were in place under Knox, who swept away papal and monarchical alternatives and led a quest for government of the church by its own officers[^34]. Knox adopted Calvin's ideas regarding the Presbyterian form of church government, which is governed by representative assemblies of elders, creating a democratic structure that stood out among surrounding Catholic and Church of England rulers[^35].

### Key Written Works and Constitutional Documents

Knox created a new order of service, The Forme of Prayers, which was eventually adopted by the Reformed Church in Scotland and came to be known as the Book of Common Order[^36]. This liturgical book was composed in Geneva in 1556 and was adopted by the Church of Scotland in 1562[^37].

In 1560, Knox and five other ministers, all called John, were called upon to draw up a new confession of faith. Within four days, the Scots Confession was presented to Parliament, voted upon, and approved on 27 August 1560[^38]. Although the Confession and its accompanying documents were the product of the joint effort of the Six Johns, its authorship is customarily attributed to John Knox[^39]. The Scots Confession was the recognized creed of the Reformed Church in Scotland from 1560 until 1647[^40].

Knox also helped author the First Book of Discipline, which contains a complete and statesmanlike scheme for the ecclesiastical administration of the realm of Scotland, for the conduct of its schools and colleges, for the relief of its poor, and for the control of its social relations[^41]. Together with the Scots Confession and the Book of Common Order, these three documents established the doctrinal and organizational foundation for the Reformed Church of Scotland during the 1560 Reformation[^42].

### Educational Vision

Knox produced visionary ideals for Scotland, with the First Book of Discipline being a kind of manifesto for a Christian commonwealth that was far-seeing about the need for universal education for children, about universities, and about relief for the poor[^43]. The plan included a system of national education based on universality as a fundamental principle, allowing for the education of the "lad o' pairts" (gifted child from a poor family who has the ability to benefit from it)[^44]. The outcome of his labors was a compulsory, universal system of free education involving character formation and enabling all to achieve the limit of their potential[^45]. The Book of Discipline (1560) provided a blueprint for a national education scheme, which included parish primary schools, burgh grammar schools, high schools, and the development of the three existing ancient universities of St Andrew's, Glasgow, and Aberdeen[^46].

### Historical and Theological Writings

Knox wrote his five-volume The History of the Reformation in Scotland between 1559 and 1566, which was his most important literary work[^47]. This remarkable work was originally dictated to his secretaries between 1559 and 1571, telling the story of his times and the progress of the Reformation in Scotland[^48]. These writings ensured that Knox's perspective on the Scottish Reformation would be preserved for future generations and established him as both a participant in and chronicler of one of history's great religious movements.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women

Knox's most infamous and controversial work was The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the Monstrous Regiment of Women, a polemical work published in 1558 that attacks female monarchs, arguing that rule by women is contrary to the Bible[^49]. The term "regiment of women" does not refer to a military-style regiment of women, but means "rule by women," and in calling the "regiment" or rule of women "monstrous," he meant that it was "unnatural"[^50]. The pamphlet has been called a classic of misogyny, using strong language to describe women as foolish, vain, sinful, weak, cruel, and irrational[^51].

The women rulers that Knox had in mind were Queen Mary I of England and Marie de Guise-Lorraine, the Dowager Queen of Scotland and regent on behalf of her daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots[^52]. The timing of the publication proved catastrophic for Knox's political ambitions. Shortly after Knox published The First Blast, Mary I died and was succeeded by a Protestant, Elizabeth I[^53]. Elizabeth remained so displeased by The First Blast that she refused to grant Knox a passport to travel through England in 1559[^54]. In a letter to Anna Locke on 6 April 1569, John Knox admitted, "To me it is written that my First Blast hath blown from me all my friends in England"[^55].

The English government quickly denounced The First Blast, and in June 1558 Mary I issued a royal proclamation banning heretical and treasonous writings from abroad, stating that anyone possessing such writings should burn them immediately or risk being executed[^56]. Even Protestant leader John Calvin disapproved of the pamphlet, assuring Elizabeth's secretary of state, William Cecil, that Knox had published it without his approval[^57]. Some scholars have debated whether Knox was truly misogynistic, with Susan M. Felch arguing that Knox was not misogynistic but just passionate about maintaining the natural order of things, noting that while Knox was writing The First Blast he was writing letters to women which were "remarkably free of gendered rhetoric"[^58].

### Conflict with Mary, Queen of Scots

Knox continued to serve as the religious leader of the Protestants throughout Mary's reign, and in several interviews with the Queen, he admonished her for supporting Catholic practices[^59]. Knox's relationship with Mary, Queen of Scots was informed by his views of women in positions of authority and by her religion, as she was a Catholic monarch ruling an increasingly Protestant country[^60]. The two met on several occasions, during which Mary tried to find a compromise to their differences, which Knox rejected[^61]. After Mary was imprisoned for her alleged role in the murder of her husband Lord Darnley, Knox openly called for her execution[^62].

### Revolutionary Resistance Theory

Knox was unique among sixteenth-century reformers in insisting that if circumstances were right, Christians had the obligation to revolt against a tyrannical monarch[^63]. Most sixteenth-century reformers didn't believe forcible resistance was ever justified—until John Knox came along[^64]. In his work "Appellation," Knox called for the right of armed resistance against ungodly rulers[^65]. Knox believed that the ruler's highest obligation was to preserve pure faith and worship; if the sovereign was Catholic, then the faithful were obliged to rid the country of such an idolatrous ruler[^66].

By spring 1558, increased persecution and four years of exile had pushed Knox into full-blown resistance theory, and in 1558 Knox wrote a series of pamphlets justifying armed resistance against "ungodly" rulers[^67]. His emphasis on the responsibilities of the "lesser magistrates" to overthrow tyrannical "greater magistrates" furthered the cause of religious freedom in Scotland but also alarmed many who feared social chaos[^68].

### Scholarly Criticism

Scholars like John Gray criticize Knox for his intensity and "exaggeration," while Quentin Skinner describes Knox's writings as "inflammatory"[^69]. He's become a bogey figure blamed for various ills, thought of as a misogynist and woman hater, and seen as an insolent, arrogant person given to harshness and even cruelty[^70]. He readily defamed his opponents but resisted criticism of himself, and was inclined to "shoot first and ask questions later" and tended to see the glass as "permanently half empty"[^71]. The misogynist tone of Knox's First Blast made him repellent to Elizabeth I and blunted any further penetration that either Knox or Geneva could make into the Church of England[^72].

## Personal Life

### First Marriage

It is not recorded exactly when Knox married his first wife, Margery Bowes, in England, though she died c. 1560[^73]. Knox attempted to obtain the consent of the Bowes family, but her father and her brother Robert Bowes were opposed to the marriage[^74]. His first wife, Marjorie Bowes, had died in December 1560, leaving him with two small sons, Nathaniel and Eleazer[^75]. This first marriage union brought into the family two sons, who were both youngsters at the time of her death[^76].

### Second Marriage and Controversy

On 26 March 1564, Knox stirred controversy again when he married Margaret Stewart, the daughter of an old friend, Andrew Stewart, 2nd Lord Ochiltree, a member of the Stuart family and a distant relative of the Queen, Mary Stuart[^77]. The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen[^78]. The marriage caused consternation from Mary, Queen of Scots, as the couple had married without having obtained royal consent[^79].

From his second marriage to Margaret Stewart, they had three daughters: Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth[^80]. Margaret lived as his wife, with a family of five—three daughters and two adopted sons—for the next eight years[^81]. All three daughters married and brought forth children of their own to continue the line of John Knox[^82]. Following Knox's death in November 1572, the General Assembly, at the suggestion of the Regent, Morton, allowed Margaret to receive, for the year succeeding her husband's death, his pension of 500 merks[^83]. In January 1574, she married her second husband, Sir Andrew Ker of Faldonside[^84].

### Personality and Preaching Style

John Knox was known as "the thundering Scot" whose fiery preaching style stirred emotions and led to significant social and political changes[^85]. His contemporaries said he preached with the sound of "ten thousand trumpets"[^86]. Despite needing help to walk to church and being lifted into the pulpit where he had to lean at first, when Knox reached the application portion of his sermon he became so active and vigorous that he was like to beat the pulpit into pieces and fly out of it[^87]. His preaching brightened his intellect, enlivened his imagination, clarified his judgment, inflamed his courage, and gave fiery energy to his utterances[^88].

Knox typically spent half an hour calmly exegeting a biblical passage, then as he applied the text to the Scottish situation, he became "active and vigorous" and would violently pound the pulpit[^89]. One note taker said "he made me so to grew [quake] and tremble, that I could not hold pen to write"[^90]. In the pulpit, he was at his most powerful, mesmerizing thousands of Scots who were prepared to lay their lives down for Protestantism at his behest, molding both nobility and ordinary folk into a formidable fighting force[^91].

## Legacy

### Foundation of Presbyterianism

John Knox is considered the notional founder of the Presbyterian denomination and was the founder of the Church of Scotland[^92]. As the foremost leader of the Scottish Reformation, Knox set the austere moral tone of the Church of Scotland and shaped the democratic form of government it adopted[^93]. In establishing Presbyterianism in Scotland, Knox allowed the Scottish Reformed church to stand out among surrounding Catholic and Church of England rulers, as the Presbyterian structure was democratic, being governed by church leaders and elders rather than placing authority in the hands of one person, a pope or monarch[^94].

### Impact on Scotland

While Scotland might have had some form of Reformation without Knox, it was from him that the Scottish Reformation received much of its character and direction[^95]. It is said of Knox that in reforming a church he formed a nation, and even to this day the impact of Knox's life and work is part of the whole framework of Scottish life[^96]. Knox's writings and his determination to fight for Scotland to be Protestant saw the Scottish nation and its identity changed forever, with Scotland's national religion remaining Protestant in nature today[^97].

### Global Influence

That Reformation, through the export of presbyterianism, had an impact on various parts of the world including North America[^98]. It has been said that the American Revolution is a Presbyterian revolution—many of its leaders were Presbyterian, having imbibed the fierce Scottish sense of independence[^99]. Knox has been described as having contributed to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change[^100].

### Educational Legacy

Although the Parliament did not approve the plan laid out in the First Book of Discipline, mainly for reasons of finance, many of its educational elements were adopted over time[^101]. Knox's vision of universal education eventually became a reality in Scotland, establishing a tradition of educational excellence that continues to distinguish Scottish culture.

### Death and Remembrance

John Knox died on 24 November 1572, having suffered a stroke in July 1570 which affected at least one of his arms[^102]. His funeral took place on November 26, 1572, two days after he died, and he was interred in the church-yard of St. Giles[^103]. Knox was the last individual to be buried in the St Giles graveyard, and his burial there was allowed by special permission after the graveyard had been closed[^104]. His funeral was attended by the newly-elected regent, Morton, by all the nobility who were in the city, and a great concourse of people[^105]. At the graveside, the regent famously said: "There lies he who never feared the face of man"[^106]. Today, the approximate site of his grave is beneath parking space number twenty-three in Parliament Square behind St. Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, marked with a stone and plaque indicating his burial location[^107].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Knox remained an instrumental figure who helped advance Reformed thinking[^108]. Knox was the most important preacher and leader of reform by a long way, and clearly must have been a major drafter of The Scots Confession and The First Book of Discipline[^109]. Knox produced visionary ideals for Scotland, with The First Book of Discipline being a kind of manifesto for a Christian commonwealth that was far-seeing about the need for universal education for children, about universities, and about relief for the poor[^110].

An early scholarly study challenged the traditional view of Knox as simply an obnoxious bigot, explaining the provocation for Knox's polemics and emphasizing his contribution to building the Scottish Kirk[^111]. Sylvester Horne claimed that John Knox "united to the statesmanship of Calvin the fiery eloquence of a Savonarola"[^112]. Modern historians recognize that while there is a bit of substance in criticisms of Knox, the modern picture is greatly exaggerated and reflects little awareness of Knox and his work[^113].

Knox's influence on democratic governance has been recognized by scholars who note that his resistance theory, though controversial in its time, contributed to later democratic movements and the principle that rulers are accountable to both God and the people[^114]. His insistence on education for all, regardless of social class, was revolutionary for his time and laid the groundwork for Scotland's later reputation for educational excellence[^115].

### Negative Views

Nevertheless, Knox's legacy is not without significant criticism. Scholars like John Gray criticize Knox for his intensity and "exaggeration," while Quentin Skinner describes Knox's writings as "inflammatory"[^116]. He's become a bogey figure blamed for various ills, thought of as a misogynist and woman hater, and seen as an insolent, arrogant person given to harshness and even cruelty[^117]. He readily defamed his opponents but resisted criticism of himself, and was inclined to "shoot first and ask questions later" and tended to see the glass as "permanently half empty"[^118].

The misogynist tone of Knox's First Blast made him repellent to Elizabeth I and blunted any further penetration that either Knox or Geneva could make into the Church of England[^119]. This single pamphlet arguably cost the Protestant movement significant political capital and prevented Knox from exerting influence in England comparable to what he achieved in Scotland[^120].

Critics also point to Knox's uncompromising nature and his willingness to advocate for violent resistance against rulers he deemed ungodly as evidence of religious extremism[^121]. His confrontational relationship with Mary, Queen of Scots, and his call for her execution have been viewed by some historians as examples of his inability to find moderate solutions to political and religious conflicts[^122]. While Knox's supporters argue that these actions were necessary in the context of the Reformation struggle, critics contend that his inflexibility contributed to the religious violence and political instability of the period[^123].
