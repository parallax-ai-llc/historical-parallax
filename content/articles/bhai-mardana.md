## Summary

Bhai Mardana was the first disciple and lifelong companion of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. He was a Muslim rebab (stringed instrument) player who accompanied Guru Nanak on all four of his great journeys (udasis) across South Asia and the Middle East. He set Guru Nanak's hymns to music. His close relationship with Guru Nanak across the Hindu-Muslim divide embodied Sikh ideals of interfaith unity.
