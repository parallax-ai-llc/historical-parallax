## Summary

On March 24, 1976, the Argentine military seized power. What followed was not just another Latin American dictatorship—it was a systematic campaign of state terror that would claim up to 30,000 lives. The generals called their regime the "National Reorganization Process." Their opponents called it the Dirty War. The victims—students, workers, journalists, anyone suspected of left-wing sympathies—simply disappeared.[^1]

The desaparecidos—the "disappeared"—became the defining feature of Argentine horror. Secret police would arrive at homes in the night. People would vanish without trial, without record, without trace. They were taken to clandestine detention centers where they were tortured and killed. Some were drugged and thrown from planes into the Atlantic Ocean. Pregnant women were kept alive until they gave birth, then murdered; their babies were given to military families. An entire generation was erased.[^2]

The Dirty War ended in 1983, brought down by military failure in the Falklands War. But the wound remains. The Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo still march. Stolen children—now adults—still discover their true identities. And Argentina still grapples with how a country that saw itself as cultured and European became a laboratory for state terror.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Argentina Before the Coup

**The Perón legacy:**
- Juan Perón: Dominant figure 1946-1955, 1973-1974
- Peronism: Populist movement; loved and hated
- Perón died July 1974
- **Isabel Perón:** His wife; became president
- Incompetent, dependent on advisers
- Triple A (Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance): Death squads already operating

**Political chaos (1974-1976):**
- Left-wing guerrillas: Montoneros, ERP (People's Revolutionary Army)
- Right-wing death squads
- Economic crisis: 600%+ inflation
- Violence from all sides
- Society polarized[^4]

## The Dirty War

### The System

**"Process of National Reorganization":**
- Congress dissolved
- Political parties banned
- Press censored
- Unions crushed
- Universities purged

**But the public surface was only part of the story.**

### Clandestine Detention Centers

**Approximately 340 secret prisons:**
- ESMA (Navy Mechanics School, Buenos Aires): Most notorious
- Campo de Mayo: Military base
- El Vesubio, El Olimpo, Automotores Orletti: Others

**What happened there:**
- Torture: Electric shock, waterboarding, beatings, rape
- Interrogation: Often pointless; victims had no information
- Execution: After extracting names of others
- Bodies disappeared

**The goal was not just information but terror.**[^6]

### Methods of Disappearance

**The "task forces":**
- Green Ford Falcons (unmarked cars) became symbol of abduction
- Night raids on homes
- Taken from workplaces, streets, universities
- Hooded, bound, transported

**"Death flights":**
- Prisoners drugged but alive
- Loaded onto military aircraft
- Thrown into the Río de la Plata or Atlantic Ocean
- Bodies washed up on beaches (some)
- **Naval Aviator Adolfo Scilingo** later confessed to participating

**No records kept. No bodies found.** Families told nothing.[^7]

### The Stolen Children

**Special horror:**
- Pregnant prisoners kept alive until giving birth
- Babies seized
- Mothers killed
- Children given to military families or regime supporters
- Identities erased
- Raised not knowing their true parents

**Estimates: ~500 babies stolen**

**Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo have identified 133 as of 2024.**[^8]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Cold War context:**
- Military saw leftist threat everywhere
- US supported (Operation Condor)
- Catholic Church largely silent or complicit
- Business elite welcomed "order"

**National factors:**
- Peronist chaos created opening
- Military tradition of intervention
- Society willing to accept junta initially
- "Subversives" dehumanized

### How Did Society Respond?

**During:**
- Most knew something was wrong
- Many didn't know extent
- Fear enforced silence
- Some cooperated willingly

**"Algo habrán hecho"** ("They must have done something")—common justification

**After:**
- Shock at revelations
- Trials broadly supported
- Memory activism strong
- But divisions persist[^13]

### Comparison

| Feature | Argentina | Chile (Pinochet) | Brazil |
|---------|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Deaths | 10,000-30,000 | 3,000+ | 434+ |
| Disappearances | Central feature | Also used | Fewer |
| Trials | Extensive | Limited | Very limited |
| Memory | Strong activism | Divided | Suppressed |

**Argentina's Dirty War was among the worst in South American history.**[^14]
