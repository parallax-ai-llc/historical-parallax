## Summary

King Myeongjong (1534-1567), personal name Yi Hwan, was the 13th monarch of the Joseon Dynasty who reigned from 1545 to 1567. Ascending to the throne at age twelve following his half-brother King Injong's sudden death, Myeongjong spent most of his reign under his mother Queen Munjeong's regency, which lasted until her death in 1565.[^1][^2] His reign was characterized by political instability, factional conflicts, widespread corruption under his maternal uncle Yun Won-hyeong, and a controversial Buddhist revival. After finally assuming direct control in 1565, Myeongjong attempted reforms by rehabilitating exiled Sarim scholars, but died only two years later at age 33 without male issue, necessitating the first collateral succession in Joseon history.[^3][^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Born on July 3, 1534, Yi Hwan was the second son of King Jungjong and Queen Munjeong of the prominent Papyeong Yun clan.[^5] Unlike his elder half-brother Crown Prince Yi Ho (later King Injong), who was born to Queen Janggyeong and raised as heir apparent, Yi Hwan grew up without expectation of ascending the throne.[^6] His early education followed the rigorous Confucian curriculum prescribed for royal princes, emphasizing the Four Books and Five Classics, though historical records provide limited detail about his childhood experiences.[^7]

The political landscape of his youth was dominated by intense factional rivalries between the established Hungu faction, composed of merit subjects and their descendants who had helped establish the dynasty, and the emerging Sarim faction of Neo-Confucian scholar-officials.[^8] These tensions had already manifested in three major literati purges (sahwa) before Myeongjong's birth—in 1498, 1504, and 1519—decimating reformist scholars and creating an atmosphere of political paranoia at court.[^9]

Yi Hwan's mother, Queen Munjeong, was a formidable political figure even before her regency. Born in 1501 to the Papyeong Yun clan, she entered the palace as a concubine to King Jungjong and gave birth to Yi Hwan in 1534.[^10] Her brother Yun Won-hyeong and her faction, known as the "Lesser Yun," would become central to the political machinations that brought her son to power.[^11] The sudden death of King Injong after only eight months of reign in August 1545—under circumstances that some historians suspect involved poisoning orchestrated by Queen Munjeong or the Lesser Yun faction—dramatically altered Yi Hwan's destiny.[^12][^13]

At age eleven, Yi Hwan found himself thrust into succession debates. Yun Im, leader of the rival "Greater Yun" faction and Injong's maternal uncle, attempted to exclude Grand Prince Gyeongwon (Yi Hwan's princely title) from succession, citing an eye disease.[^14] However, Queen Munjeong's political maneuvering and support from officials like Yi Eon-jeok secured his succession, and on August 7, 1545, the twelve-year-old prince ascended the throne as King Myeongjong.[^15]

---

## Rise to Power

Myeongjong's accession marked not his own rise to power but rather his mother's. Since he was too young to govern, Queen Munjeong immediately assumed the role of regent, formally holding this position from 1545 to 1553, though she continued to wield de facto control until her death in 1565—making her regency the longest by any woman in Joseon history.[^16][^17] This extended period of maternal dominance would define the entire character of Myeongjong's reign.

The transition of power unleashed the Fourth Literati Purge of 1545, known as Eulsa Sahwa (을사사화). Unlike the previous three purges, which had been ideological conflicts between reformist Sarim scholars and conservative Hungu officials, this purge was fundamentally a power struggle between royal in-laws—the Greater Yun faction loyal to the deceased King Injong and the Lesser Yun faction supporting Myeongjong and Queen Munjeong.[^18][^19]

Yun Won-hyeong, Queen Munjeong's brother, accused Yun Im and his supporters of plotting treason by attempting to place a different prince on the throne. Initially, this accusation backfired, leading to Yun Won-hyeong's brief exile.[^20] However, persistent rumors and renewed accusations eventually resulted in the execution of Yun Im, nine of his supporters, and numerous Sarim scholars in 1545.[^21] Over the following five years, Yun Won-hyeong continued purging rivals until the death toll exceeded one hundred, making the Fourth Literati Purge the most intense and deadly of all four sahwa in Joseon history.[^22]

This political bloodletting consolidated the Lesser Yun faction's control over the government. Yun Won-hyeong's ascent was meteoric: he became Minister of Personnel in 1548, Left State Councilor in 1551, and ultimately Chief State Councilor (the highest government position) in 1563.[^23] His second wife, Jeong Nan-jeong, leveraged her close relationship with Queen Munjeong to wield considerable influence over court appointments and decisions.[^24]

The young king remained politically marginalized throughout this period. Historical records suggest that even after Queen Munjeong formally stepped down from the regency in 1553, she retained sufficient power to function as the de facto ruler.[^25] The fact that the king's words were immediately conveyed to the queen dowager indicates that Myeongjong never completely escaped from his mother's shadow during her lifetime.[^26]

## Major Achievements

Despite the political turbulence and limited personal authority, several significant developments occurred during Myeongjong's reign, though most should be attributed to Queen Munjeong's policies rather than the king's initiatives.

### Buddhist Revival

The most notable cultural achievement of this era was an unprecedented Buddhist revival in the strongly Neo-Confucian Joseon state. Throughout the dynasty, Buddhism had been actively suppressed, with monks relegated to slave-equivalent social status and forbidden from entering the capital city.[^27][^28] Queen Munjeong, a devout Buddhist, systematically worked to reverse these policies.

In 1548, she ordered the reconstruction of Bongeunsa Temple in Seoul and appointed the monk Bo-wu to oversee the project.[^29] By 1551, Bongeunsa became the main temple of the Jogye Seon Order and the headquarters for Korean Buddhism's overall restoration.[^30] Bo-wu revived the official examination system for training and selecting monks in both the Seon (meditative) and Gyo (scholastic) traditions—a system first established in the 13th century but abolished in 1501.[^31]

The expansion was dramatic: approximately 40 memorial shrines (naewondang) existed in 1545, but by 1550 this had increased to 79 large temples, expanding to 400 by 1554, and nearly all temples in the kingdom had been registered as naewondang by 1565.[^32] From 1552 to 1564, Bongeunsa served as the center for the Buddhist National Exam.[^33]

### Educational Development

In 1550, King Myeongjong granted royal authorization to Sosu Seowon, the country's first private Neo-Confucian academy, bestowing a nameplate inscribed in his own handwriting at the request of the renowned scholar Yi Hwang (Toegye).[^34][^35] This established a precedent for royal patronage of seowon (Confucian academies), which would become the most common educational institutions in Joseon and centers of Sarim intellectual life.[^36] The seowon system would eventually produce nine institutions recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2019.[^37]

### Military and Coastal Defense

During Myeongjong's reign, Joseon faced persistent security challenges from multiple directions. Japanese pirates (wokou) conducted large-scale raids along the Korean coast, with particularly severe attacks during the Saryangjin and Eulmyo years.[^38] In response, the Joseon navy developed the Panokseon (板屋船), a warship design that would later prove crucial during the Imjin War against Japanese invasion.[^39]

The rebel leader Im Kkeok-jeong led a peasant uprising in Hwanghae Province from 1559 to 1562, sparked by heavy taxation. His forces raided government offices in Hwanghae and Gyeonggi provinces, killed officials, seized grain and valuables from warehouses, and redistributed resources to the poor.[^40] Im Kkeok-jeong was eventually arrested and executed in 1562.[^41]

Jurchen tribes attacked the northern frontier numerous times, seriously depleting military resources.[^42] The Joseon Dynasty had to remobilize its army and navy to protect its borders against these multiple external threats.[^43]

### Historiographical Development

During Myeongjong's reign, a historiographical practice suspended under King Injong was reinstated: requiring diarist-historians to sign their names on their records, making them personally accountable for historical documentation.[^44] After the devastating Imjin War (1592-1598), the Veritable Records up through Myeongjong's reign were reproduced in a massive project from 1603 to 1606, creating five complete sets to safeguard this irreplaceable historical documentation.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Myeongjong's reign is remembered primarily for its failures, corruption, and political instability—problems largely beyond the young king's control but which defined his historical legacy.

### The Yun Won-hyeong Corruption Scandal

The most damaging aspect of this era was the corruption that flourished under Yun Won-hyeong's administration. Protected by his sister Queen Munjeong, Yun Won-hyeong and the Lesser Yun faction (Soyun) engaged in systematic corruption so egregious that it provoked widespread popular resentment.[^46][^47] While the kingdom suffered instability, external threats from Jurchens, Japanese pirates, and internal rebellions rampaged unchecked, threatening the government itself.[^48]

Yun Won-hyeong's second wife, Jeong Nan-jeong, leveraged her close relationship with Queen Munjeong to accumulate power and wealth alongside her husband.[^49] Together they controlled court appointments, extracted bribes, and enriched themselves while governance deteriorated. The extent of their corruption became a symbol of the reign's dysfunction.

### The Fourth Literati Purge

The brutal elimination of over one hundred scholars, officials, and political rivals during the Fourth Literati Purge created a climate of fear and intellectual stagnation.[^50] Unlike previous purges that targeted specific ideological positions, this massacre was transparently about consolidating family power. Many talented Sarim scholars, including Yi Eon-jeok, were executed or exiled.[^51]

The purge drove surviving Sarim scholars to rural villages, where they built seowon academies, effectively removing reformist voices from central government for two decades.[^52] The renowned Neo-Confucian philosopher Yi Hwang left politics in the aftermath and refused to return despite repeated royal summons.[^53]

### Buddhist Revival Backlash

Queen Munjeong's aggressive Buddhist revival sparked intense controversy in the rigidly Neo-Confucian state. Confucian scholars considered it unacceptable to revive Buddhism at the state level in Joseon, which had been founded on the principle of suppressing Buddhism.[^54] Even officials loyal to Queen Munjeong articulated opposition to her pro-Buddhist policies, revealing the depth of resistance.[^55]

The monk Bo-wu himself was controversial. Historical records suggest he "stealthily recognized [Queen Munjeong's] wishful thinking and set himself up" rather than being a legitimate spiritual leader, implying opportunism.[^56] Immediately after Queen Munjeong's death in 1565, Bo-wu was killed by anti-Buddhist officials, and Buddhist institutions quickly lost their privileged status.[^57]

### Weak Royal Authority

Perhaps the most fundamental criticism was Myeongjong's inability to exercise royal authority. For the first twenty years of his reign, he remained politically impotent while his mother and uncle controlled the government.[^58] Even after reaching adulthood, Queen Munjeong continued to dominate, and the king's words were immediately conveyed to her, suggesting he never completely escaped her shadow.[^59]

In a revealing exchange recorded in the Veritable Records, Myeongjong asked his uncle Yun Won-hyeong, "What should I do if my maternal relative commits a grave sin?" Yun Won-hyeong scolded him: "Jusang [Your Majesty], do you think you would have become king if it were not for your mother and maternal uncle?"[^60] This stark reminder of his dependence on the Lesser Yun faction for his throne encapsulates the king's powerlessness.

### Natural Disasters and Famine

In 1554, a severe famine struck the Yeongnam region (Gyeongsang-do province). The Veritable Records describe desperate conditions where people had nothing to eat and some attempted to consume cottonseed, resulting in deaths.[^61] To address such crises, the government published Guhwang chwaryo, a book describing relief crops for poor harvests.[^62] However, the government's corruption and ineffectiveness limited the impact of such measures.

---

## Personal Life

Historical records provide relatively limited information about Myeongjong's personal character and private life, as most documentation focuses on political events during his mother's regency.

### Health and Physical Constitution

Myeongjong suffered from a lifelong frail constitution and chronic ailments. He was diagnosed with simyeol (심열, heart heat syndrome)—a traditional Korean medical condition involving perceived excess heat associated with emotional strain—alongside persistent indigestion and general physical weakness.[^63] These conditions intensified dramatically in 1567, rendering him bedridden and unable to govern effectively by mid-year.[^64] His poor health may have been exacerbated by the stress of his political situation and his inability to exercise meaningful authority for most of his reign.

### Marriage and Family

In 1544, before becoming king, Yi Hwan married Lady Sim (1532-1575), who would become Queen Insun upon his accession.[^65] In 1551, Queen Insun gave birth to their son, Yi Bu, titled Crown Prince Sunhoe.[^66] The birth of an heir was celebrated as securing the succession, and in 1557, at age six, Prince Sunhoe was formally designated Crown Prince.[^67]

Tragedy struck in 1563 when Crown Prince Sunhoe died suddenly at Gyeongbokgung Palace on October 6, at age twelve or thirteen.[^68] Historical sources indicate the cause was poison, though the circumstances remain unclear.[^69] The Crown Prince's widow, Crown Princess Gonghoe, became a widow at approximately age ten and never had children; Queen Insun permitted her to remain in the palace for life.[^70]

The death of his only son left Myeongjong without direct heirs. Despite four more years of marriage, Queen Insun bore no additional children. This succession crisis would have profound consequences when Myeongjong died in 1567.

### Personality and Character

The fragmentary evidence suggests Myeongjong was a well-intentioned but politically weak ruler. After his mother's death freed him from her regency in 1565, he immediately moved to reform the government by executing Yun Won-hyeong and Jeong Nan-jeong and rehabilitating exiled Sarim scholars—demonstrating an awareness of his reign's problems and a desire for reform.[^71][^72] However, his frail health, limited administrative experience after twenty years of political marginalization, and early death prevented these reforms from achieving meaningful impact.

Scholarly assessments suggest Myeongjong lacked the forceful personality necessary to assert authority over his domineering mother and corrupt uncle.[^73] Whether this reflected genuine weakness of character or simply the impossible position of a child king raised in political subordination remains debated.

## Legacy

King Myeongjong's legacy is complex and predominantly negative, though modern scholarship attempts more nuanced assessments.

### Immediate Succession Crisis

Myeongjong's death on the 28th day of the 6th lunar month in 1567 (August 12, 1567, in the Gregorian calendar) at Yangsimdang in Gyeongbokgung Palace at age 33-34 created an unprecedented succession crisis.[^74] With no surviving sons, daughters, or other direct descendants, the throne could not pass to a direct heir for the first time since Joseon's founding in 1392.[^75]

The succession passed to Yi Gyun (also known as Yi Yeon or Yi Hon), Prince Haseong, Myeongjong's fourteen-year-old half-nephew—the son of Myeongjong's deceased half-brother Grand Internal Prince Deokheung.[^76] This collateral succession, facilitated by Queen Insun adopting Prince Haseong in consultation with senior officials, marked a significant moment in dynastic history.[^77] The new king, known as Seonjo, would rule for 41 years and face the devastating Imjin War (1592-1598).

### Political Transformation

Ironically, Myeongjong's reign—despite its dysfunction—set the stage for profound political transformation. The Hungu faction, which had dominated Joseon politics since the dynasty's founding, wielded power through Myeongjong's reign but permanently lost influence with Seonjo's ascension in 1567.[^78] The Sarim faction, decimated in the literati purges but preserved in rural seowon academies, gained control of central government under Seonjo and dominated Joseon politics thereafter.[^79]

This shift had lasting consequences. The Sarim faction's Neo-Confucian ideology, emphasis on moral governance, and resistance to centralized power would shape Joseon political culture for the dynasty's remaining three centuries. The seowon system that flourished during Myeongjong's reign despite political persecution became the institutional foundation for Sarim intellectual and political networks.

### Buddhist Resurgence—Brief but Significant

The Buddhist revival under Queen Munjeong, though quickly reversed after her death, represented the final significant state-sponsored flourishing of Buddhism in Joseon history.[^80] While Myeongjong's government resumed suppression policies after 1565, the brief revival demonstrated Buddhism's enduring cultural presence and the religion's resilience despite official persecution.[^81] Bongeunsa Temple, reconstructed during this period, remains a significant Buddhist institution in modern Seoul.

### Historical Reputation

Myeongjong is buried at Gangneung Royal Tomb (강릉) in Seoul's Hwarang-dong, adjacent to his mother's tomb at Taereung.[^82] Both tombs were designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2009 as part of the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.[^83]

His reign is generally considered one of the weakest and most troubled in Joseon history. The Veritable Records of King Myeongjong (명종실록), compiled by post-reign Neo-Confucian officials, portray him as ineffectual and overly filial to his mother, though modern scholars note these compilations reflect the biases of their compilers—Sarim scholars who had suffered under his reign and sought to justify their own subsequent political dominance.[^84]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Few scholars offer unqualified praise for Myeongjong's reign, but some defend the king and contextualize the period's difficulties.

**Sympathetic Reassessment of the King**: Modern historians argue that Myeongjong faced impossible circumstances. Ascending the throne at twelve, he spent his formative years politically marginalized by his mother's regency and uncle's corruption.[^85] When he finally gained control at age 31 in 1565, he moved decisively to reform the government, executing Yun Won-hyeong and Jeong Nan-jeong and rehabilitating purged Sarim scholars.[^86] His early death only two years later prevented these reforms from bearing fruit. From this perspective, Myeongjong should be seen as a tragic figure rather than a weak ruler.

**Queen Munjeong's Administrative Competence**: Some scholars, particularly Jongmyung Kim (2014) and others, re-evaluate Queen Munjeong's regency more favorably.[^87] They argue she was "an effective administrator" who maintained governmental stability during a period of factional conflict.[^88] Her Buddhist revival represented "continuity with pre-Joseon traditions rather than aberration," challenging the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy that had marginalized other philosophical and religious traditions.[^89] Her twenty-year regency, the longest by any woman in Joseon history, demonstrated political acumen in a patriarchal system.

**Cultural Achievements**: The reign saw significant cultural developments, including the royal authorization of Sosu Seowon in 1550, establishing the seowon system that became central to Korean Confucian education.[^90] The Buddhist revival, though controversial, preserved artistic traditions and supported architectural projects. The development of the Panokseon warship during this period would prove crucial to Korean naval victories in the subsequent Imjin War.[^91]

**Historiographical Contributions**: The reinstatement of signed historical records and the later reproduction of the Veritable Records through Myeongjong's reign preserved invaluable historical documentation.[^92] These records, despite their biases, provide unprecedented detail about mid-16th century Korean politics and society.

### Negative Views

The scholarly consensus remains predominantly critical of Myeongjong's reign, with harsh assessments from both contemporary and modern historians.

**Weak and Ineffectual Leadership**: The most common criticism is that Myeongjong was a weak ruler who never effectively governed. One Korean scholarly source bluntly states: "There is little performance that [shows] it was a decent king even when [we] see his tracks."[^93] For twenty years, he remained subordinate to his mother and uncle, failing to assert royal authority even after reaching adulthood. His frail health and passive personality made him unsuitable for the demands of kingship.

**Era of Corruption and Misgovernment**: Historians universally condemn the corruption that flourished under Yun Won-hyeong's administration. One source notes: "The corruption of the Soyun faction (the king's maternal uncle Yun Won-hyeong) who had gained power was so severe that they aroused the resentment of the people."[^94] The king's inability or unwillingness to check his uncle's abuses represents a fundamental failure of governance. While Jurchens, Japanese pirates, and rebels threatened the state, the government focused on factional purges and personal enrichment.[^95]

**The Fourth Literati Purge**: The massacre of over one hundred scholars and officials purely for factional advantage is considered one of the darkest episodes in Joseon history.[^96] Unlike earlier purges that had ideological dimensions, the 1545 purge was transparently about consolidating the Lesser Yun faction's power. The two-decade exile of talented Sarim scholars deprived the government of capable administrators and reformist voices precisely when they were most needed.

**Controversial Buddhist Revival**: Neo-Confucian scholars, both contemporary and modern, view Queen Munjeong's Buddhist policies as ideologically inappropriate and politically divisive. In a state founded on Neo-Confucian principles with Buddhism suppression as official policy, her aggressive revival was seen as illegitimate.[^97] The perception that the monk Bo-wu opportunistically manipulated the queen for personal advancement further taints this initiative.[^98] The swift reversal of Buddhist policies after Queen Munjeong's death demonstrates the lack of genuine support for these reforms.

**Historiographical Bias and Political Opportunism**: The Myeongjong sillok (annals) were compiled by Sarim officials who had suffered persecution during his reign and sought to justify their subsequent political dominance under Seonjo.[^99] These compilers had incentives to portray Myeongjong as ineffectual and to amplify the regency's failures. However, even accounting for this bias, the substantive evidence of corruption, political instability, and weak governance remains overwhelming.

## Famous Quotes

Historical records preserve few direct quotes from King Myeongjong himself, reflecting his limited political voice during most of his reign. The following quotations capture the political dynamics of the period:

> "What should I do if my maternal relative commits a grave sin?" — King Myeongjong to his uncle Yun Won-hyeong

This poignant question, recorded in the Veritable Records, reveals Myeongjong's awareness of his uncle's corruption and his own powerlessness to address it. Yun Won-hyeong's response was brutally direct: "Jusang [Your Majesty], do you think you would have become king if it were not for your mother and maternal uncle?" This exchange encapsulates the king's tragic political position—trapped by dependence on the very relatives whose abuses he could not check.[^100]

> "The fact that the king's words were immediately conveyed to the queen dowager means that Queen Munjeong did not completely withdraw from politics." — Observation from the Veritable Records

This administrative note, rather than a direct quote, nevertheless speaks volumes about the power dynamics during Myeongjong's reign. Even after formally stepping down as regent, Queen Munjeong maintained ultimate authority, with the king unable to act independently.[^101]

> "There is little performance that it was a decent king even when we see his tracks." — Korean scholarly assessment

While not a contemporary quote, this harsh modern evaluation from Korean historical scholarship summarizes the consensus view of Myeongjong's effectiveness as a ruler.[^102]

Regarding the Buddhist revival under Queen Munjeong:

> "The Queen Mother attempted to restore Buddhism but there was no proper monk to assume it, and she searched for such a monk by tracing rumors but ended in failure, while the monk Bou stealthily recognized her wishful thinking and set himself up." — Historical record regarding monk Bo-wu

This critical assessment, recorded in historical documents, reflects Neo-Confucian scholars' view that the Buddhist revival was opportunistic rather than spiritually legitimate.[^103]
