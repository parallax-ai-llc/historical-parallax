## Summary

Chen Yonghua (陳永華, 1634–1680), courtesy name Fufu (復甫), was a prominent scholar-official and chief minister of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan during the late 17th century. Serving as the principal advisor to Zheng Jing, son of the legendary Koxinga, Chen is credited with establishing the foundation of Han Chinese culture in Taiwan through his comprehensive administrative, educational, and economic reforms. He built Taiwan's first Confucian temple and academy, introduced revolutionary agricultural techniques including sugarcane cultivation for export, and implemented governmental systems that transformed Taiwan from a military outpost into a functioning civil society. Despite his pivotal role in Taiwan's early development, Chen fell victim to court intrigue in 1680 and died shortly after being ousted from power.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Chen Yonghua was born in 1634 in the region near modern-day Quanzhou in Fujian Province, during the final years of the Ming Dynasty.[^3] Little is definitively known about his early childhood, but historical records indicate he came from a scholarly family committed to Confucian learning and the Ming cause. His formative years coincided with the tumultuous period of the Ming-Qing transition, when Manchu forces were conquering China and establishing the Qing Dynasty.

The defining tragedy of Chen's youth occurred in 1648 when he was merely fourteen years old. Qing forces invaded Tongan County in Fujian, and during this assault, Chen's father was forced to commit suicide by the invading Qing army.[^4] This traumatic event would shape Chen's entire life trajectory, instilling in him a deep-seated opposition to Qing rule and unwavering loyalty to the Ming loyalist cause. Orphaned and displaced by war, the young Chen sought refuge with Zheng Chenggong, better known as Koxinga, the powerful Ming loyalist general who controlled significant maritime forces along China's southeastern coast.

Under Koxinga's protection, Chen Yonghua's exceptional scholarly abilities and strategic acumen became apparent. He was appointed as tutor to Koxinga's son, Zheng Jing, a position that would prove crucial to his future career.[^5] This tutorship established a relationship of trust and intellectual companionship between Chen and the younger Zheng that would last throughout their lives. Chen's education emphasized classical Confucian texts, military strategy, and statecraft, preparing him uniquely for the role he would later assume in governing Taiwan.

When Koxinga successfully expelled the Dutch East India Company from Taiwan in 1662, establishing the Kingdom of Tungning as the last bastion of Ming resistance, Chen Yonghua followed the Zheng family to the island. However, Koxinga died unexpectedly just months after this victory, plunging the nascent kingdom into uncertainty and creating the conditions for Chen's rise to prominence.[^6]

---

## Rise to Power

Following Koxinga's sudden death in June 1662, the Kingdom of Tungning faced an immediate succession crisis that threatened to tear the young regime apart. A power struggle erupted between Zheng Jing, who had been stationed in Fujian commanding mainland operations, and Koxinga's fifth son Zheng Xi, who was in Taiwan.[^7] A faction of officials, headed by Huang Zhao and Xiao Gongchen, opposed Zheng Jing's succession, citing his absence from Taiwan and questioning his legitimacy.

Chen Yonghua demonstrated both his military capabilities and political loyalty during this critical juncture. He led an army alongside other supporters to confront Huang Zhao's faction in Tainan.[^8] The forces of Zheng Jing and Zheng Xi clashed off the coast of Chikan (present-day Tainan), and in the ensuing battle, Huang Zhao was defeated and killed. Zheng Xi was subsequently placed under house arrest, and those who had initially supported him surrendered to Zheng Jing.[^9] Chen's decisive military action and unwavering support proved instrumental in securing Zheng Jing's ascension to power.

As a reward for his loyalty and recognizing his administrative talents, Zheng Jing promoted Chen Yonghua to the position of Chief Minister of Tungning.[^10] Chen's role in the Kingdom of Tungning has been likened by historians to that of a modern prime minister, with Zheng Jing entrusting him with oversight of all governmental affairs.[^11] The young ruler, preferring military campaigns to administrative duties, delegated the day-to-day governance of the kingdom to his former tutor. Oversight of all affairs was given to Chen Yonghua, the Advisory Staff Officers, and Feng Xifan, head of the Imperial Bodyguard, though Chen held the preeminent position.[^12]

This arrangement granted Chen Yonghua extraordinary authority to reshape Taiwan's governmental, economic, and cultural institutions. Unlike many advisors whose influence remained theoretical, Chen possessed both the vision and the practical power to implement comprehensive reforms. In 1674, this relationship was further cemented when Chen's daughter married Crown Prince Zheng Kezang, creating a familial bond between the Chen and Zheng families.[^13] When Zheng Jing departed Taiwan in 1674 to participate in the Revolt of the Three Feudatories on the mainland, he left Chen in complete charge of the kingdom, demonstrating absolute trust in his chief minister's capabilities.[^14]

## Major Achievements

Chen Yonghua's tenure as Chief Minister of the Kingdom of Tungning from 1662 to 1680 represents one of the most transformative periods in early Taiwanese history. His comprehensive reforms touched virtually every aspect of society, laying foundations that would persist long after the kingdom's fall.

### Educational and Cultural Reforms

Perhaps Chen's most enduring legacy was the establishment of Taiwan's first formal education system. In 1665, Chen built the Tainan Confucian Temple, Taiwan's first Confucian temple, along with an associated academy known as the National Academy (Guo Xue).[^15] Located on the site that became known as "Quan Tai Shou Xue" (全臺首學), literally meaning "First Academy of Taiwan," this institution established Confucian learning as the foundation of Taiwanese culture and administration.[^16] The temple complex included the Ming-Lun Hall, which served as a place for instructors to offer lectures and cultivate intellectuals, effectively creating Taiwan's first center of public education.[^17]

Chen's educational vision went beyond mere building construction. He created a comprehensive curriculum based on Confucian classics, established examination systems modeled on the imperial examinations, and recruited qualified teachers from the mainland. This systematization of learning helped transform Taiwan from a frontier military outpost into a cultured society capable of producing its own administrative class. The emphasis on Confucian values also served a political purpose, reinforcing the kingdom's claim to represent legitimate Ming culture against what loyalists viewed as barbarian Qing usurpers.

### Agricultural and Economic Innovations

Chen Yonghua is credited with introducing revolutionary agricultural techniques that fundamentally altered Taiwan's economy and landscape. Most significantly, he promoted the deliberate cultivation of sugarcane as a cash crop for trade with Europeans and other Asian markets, establishing Taiwan's sugar industry that would remain economically vital for centuries.[^18] He introduced cooperative unit machinery for mass refining of sugar, greatly increasing production efficiency and quality.[^19]

Beyond sugar, Chen implemented water-storage systems for Taiwan's annual dry periods, enabling more reliable year-round agriculture.[^20] He initiated policies that boosted food production, ensuring that by 1666, grain harvests were sufficient to keep soldiers and civilians well-nourished.[^21] Under his administration, areas under cultivation in Taiwan reached 43,699.7 hectares by 1684, more than triple the 12,500 hectares cultivated at the end of Dutch rule in 1660.[^22]

Chen also revolutionized Taiwan's salt production by introducing mass salt drying through evaporation in coastal areas, creating much higher quality salt than could be obtained from the rare rock salt deposits on the island.[^23] This innovation made Tungning self-sufficient in salt, an essential commodity for food preservation and a significant source of government revenue. His policies also promoted brick production, creating materials necessary for the kingdom's building programs.[^24]

### Administrative and Fiscal Reforms

Chen created comprehensive governmental policies to develop Tungning's agriculture, education, finance, industry, and trade.[^25] He established a systematic tax system to fund the kingdom's operations, though historical sources note this taxation was "almost as harsh as that of the Dutch colonials," indicating that his economic efficiency came at a cost to the common people.[^26] When Qing blockades caused cloth and other imports to become prohibitively expensive, Chen advised Zheng Jing to bribe Qing commanders enforcing the embargo, a pragmatic solution that successfully restored the flow of goods to the island.[^27]

His administrative approach balanced military necessity with civil development, maintaining the garrison farming system (tuntian) where soldiers doubled as farmers, ensuring both military readiness and economic productivity. This system helped the kingdom maintain its defensive capabilities while developing its agricultural base.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his undeniable achievements, Chen Yonghua's governance was not without significant controversies and criticisms that reveal the complex realities of his administration.

### Harsh Taxation Policies

Historical records indicate that Chen implemented a tax system described as "almost as harsh as that of the Dutch colonials."[^28] This characterization suggests that while Chen's policies successfully funded governmental operations and development projects, they imposed substantial burdens on the common people. The comparison to Dutch taxation—remembered negatively by the Chinese population—indicates widespread resentment of the fiscal demands placed on farmers and merchants. The need to support both military operations and ambitious development programs required extracting significant resources from a relatively small population, creating tensions between the government and the governed.

### Political Vulnerability and Court Intrigue

Chen's position, while powerful, ultimately proved fragile. His influence derived entirely from Zheng Jing's personal trust rather than any independent power base. When Zheng Jing returned from a failed mainland campaign in 1680, rival officials Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan successfully orchestrated Chen's removal from power.[^29] Historical accounts attribute their success to jealousy of Chen's authority and influence.[^30] Feng Xifan reportedly tricked Chen into resigning from his posts in June 1680, effectively excluding him from the center of power.[^31]

This vulnerability highlights a potential criticism of Chen's political acumen—despite his administrative brilliance, he failed to build sufficient political alliances or safeguards to protect himself from court factions. His complete reliance on Zheng Jing's favor meant that shifts in political winds could instantly erase decades of service.

### Questions About Military Strategy

While Chen successfully helped Zheng Jing secure power in 1662, the Kingdom of Tungning's overall strategic position deteriorated during his tenure as chief minister. The failed 1680 mainland campaign that preceded his ouster suggests possible shortcomings in long-term strategic planning. Whether Chen bears responsibility for encouraging unrealistic mainland ambitions or failing to adequately prepare military forces remains debated by historians.

### Limited Social Reforms

Despite his comprehensive governmental reforms, Chen's administration largely preserved hierarchical social structures and offered little to indigenous Taiwanese populations. His reforms primarily benefited Chinese settlers and did little to integrate or protect the rights of Taiwan's aboriginal peoples, who faced increasing marginalization as Chinese settlement expanded. This limitation reflects the Ming loyalist ideology that viewed Chinese culture as superior and worthy of transplantation, rather than any multicultural vision.

## Personal Life

Details about Chen Yonghua's personal life remain relatively sparse in historical records, which focus primarily on his official activities. However, the available information reveals important dimensions of his character and relationships.

Chen's personality appears to have been characterized by scholarly discipline, administrative diligence, and unwavering loyalty to the Ming cause and the Zheng family. His early trauma—witnessing his father's forced suicide at Qing hands—likely instilled both a deep hatred for the Qing dynasty and a solemn sense of duty to preserve Ming culture and governance. This formative experience transformed him from merely a scholar-official into an ideological warrior fighting to preserve Chinese civilization as he understood it.

His relationship with Zheng Jing transcended typical minister-ruler dynamics, having its roots in Chen's role as Zheng's childhood tutor. This long-standing personal connection created bonds of trust that enabled Chen's extraordinary authority. When Chen's daughter married Crown Prince Zheng Kezang in 1674, it formalized the familial connection between the two families.[^32] This marriage alliance was part of Zheng Jing's broader strategy of binding his most trusted officials to the royal family through matrimonial ties—Zheng Keshuang, another prince, married the daughter of Feng Xifan.[^33]

The marriage of Chen's daughter to the crown prince provides glimpses into Chen's family life and suggests he had children, though historical records provide few details about his wife or other family members. The tragic fate of his daughter—Princess Chen committed suicide following the death of Zheng Jing and the murder of her husband Zheng Kezang in the Tungning Coup of 1681—occurred after Chen's own death and represents the ultimate tragedy of the loyalist cause both families served.[^34]

Chen's final months reveal the isolation that could accompany political downfall. After Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan successfully maneuvered him out of power in June 1680, Chen withdrew from political life.[^35] Just one month later, in July 1680, Chen fell ill and died.[^36] Whether his death resulted from natural illness exacerbated by the stress of his downfall, or from more sinister causes, remains unclear in historical records. He was buried in the mountains near Tainan, where his grave became a site of historical memory.[^37]

## Legacy

Chen Yonghua's influence on Taiwan extended far beyond his eighteen years of governance, establishing cultural and institutional foundations that shaped the island's development for centuries.

### Cultural and Educational Impact

The Tainan Confucian Temple that Chen established in 1665 remained a vital center of learning and cultural preservation throughout the Qing period and into modern times. It stands today as both a historical monument and an active site for Confucian ceremonies, serving as Taiwan's oldest surviving Confucian temple.[^38] The educational system Chen pioneered—emphasizing classical learning, examination culture, and Confucian values—created Taiwan's scholarly class and established patterns of education that persisted through multiple regime changes.

Chen is widely recognized as having done more than any other single individual to lay the foundation for Han Chinese culture in Taiwan.[^39] This assessment, while reflecting certain biases about whose culture "mattered" in Taiwan's development, acknowledges his transformative role in establishing the institutions, practices, and values that would characterize Taiwan's Chinese population.

### Agricultural and Economic Legacy

The agricultural innovations Chen introduced—particularly sugarcane cultivation and sugar refining—established Taiwan's sugar industry, which became the island's economic backbone for the next three centuries. Under Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945), Taiwan became one of the world's major sugar exporters, building directly on the foundations Chen laid. His water management techniques and crop diversification strategies contributed to making Taiwan agriculturally productive and economically valuable.

The expansion of cultivated land from 12,500 hectares in 1660 to over 43,699 hectares by 1684 represented a transformation of Taiwan's landscape that accelerated Chinese settlement and economic integration.[^40] This agricultural development created the economic surplus necessary to support Taiwan's growing population and governmental institutions.

### Literary and Popular Cultural Legacy

Chen Yonghua achieved a unique form of immortality through his transformation into the character Chen Jinnan in Louis Cha's (Jin Yong) famous wuxia novel "The Deer and the Cauldron" (鹿鼎記).[^41] In the novel, Chen Jinnan appears as the heroic martial arts master and leader of the Tiandihui (Heaven and Earth Society), an anti-Qing secret organization. The fictional Chen Jinnan embodies idealized qualities of loyalty, righteousness, and martial prowess, becoming one of the novel's most admired characters.

This literary legacy has introduced Chen Yonghua to millions of readers across the Chinese-speaking world who might never otherwise have encountered this historical figure. The multiple film and television adaptations of the novel have further popularized this fictionalized version of Chen, though they often bear little resemblance to the historical administrator. This dual existence—as both historical figure and literary hero—has secured Chen's place in Chinese cultural memory.

### Historical Commemoration

In Taiwan, particularly in Tainan where Chen spent his years of governance, various sites commemorate his contributions. His grave in the mountains near Tainan became a site of historical pilgrimage, and temples were erected in his honor.[^42] These physical monuments ensure that Chen's memory remains tangible in Taiwan's cultural landscape.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern historians and Taiwanese cultural commentators frequently identify Chen Yonghua as one of Taiwan's most important historical figures, particularly in the island's early Chinese period. He is characterized as a brilliant administrator whose comprehensive reforms demonstrated both strategic vision and practical implementation skills.

Scholars particularly praise Chen's educational reforms as visionary, noting that establishing formal Confucian education in what was then a frontier society showed remarkable foresight about Taiwan's future development. By creating institutions for cultivating local talent, Chen helped ensure Taiwan could develop its own administrative class rather than remaining perpetually dependent on mainland officials. His emphasis on education reflected Confucian ideals that learning and moral cultivation formed the foundation of good governance.

Economic historians credit Chen with transforming Taiwan's economy from subsistence-level agriculture to a productive system capable of generating export commodities and government revenues. His introduction of sugarcane cultivation demonstrated economic insight in recognizing Taiwan's climatic advantages and the commercial opportunities presented by European and Asian trade networks. The fact that sugar remained Taiwan's primary export for centuries validates his economic strategy.

Chen's role in preserving and transmitting Chinese culture during a period of conquest and transition receives particular emphasis from scholars sympathetic to Ming loyalist perspectives. During the chaos of the Ming-Qing transition, when traditional Chinese institutions faced destruction or transformation, Chen created a space where Ming governmental forms, Confucian learning, and Chinese cultural practices could be preserved and practiced. From this perspective, Chen served as a cultural guardian who ensured continuity of Chinese civilization.

Taiwanese historians sometimes view Chen as an early contributor to a distinctly Taiwanese identity, noting that his reforms helped create local institutions and practices that would differentiate Taiwan from mainland China. While Chen himself would have identified primarily as a Ming loyalist and Chinese Confucian scholar, his work in establishing Taiwan-based education and governance contributed to the island's gradual development of unique characteristics.

### Negative Views

Critical historians point to several problematic aspects of Chen's legacy. His harsh taxation policies imposed substantial burdens on ordinary people, and the comparison to Dutch colonial taxation suggests his administration prioritized state needs over popular welfare. The efficiency and effectiveness that characterize his positive reputation came at a cost to those who bore the tax burden.

Chen's political vulnerabilities and ultimate downfall raise questions about his political wisdom. Despite serving as chief minister for nearly two decades, he failed to build sufficient political alliances or institutional safeguards to protect himself when rivals emerged. His complete dependence on Zheng Jing's personal favor represented a significant political miscalculation that left him defenseless when court factions turned against him.

From indigenous perspectives, Chen's legacy appears far more problematic. His agricultural policies accelerated Chinese settlement and land development, which increasingly displaced aboriginal populations from their traditional territories. The expansion of cultivated land from 12,500 to over 43,699 hectares represented not just economic development but also the appropriation of indigenous lands. Chen's governance gave no consideration to indigenous rights or welfare, viewing Taiwan purely as territory to be developed for Chinese settlement.

Postcolonial scholars critique the uncritical celebration of Chen as a "founder" of Taiwanese culture, noting that this narrative privileges Chinese settlers' perspectives while marginalizing indigenous peoples who had inhabited Taiwan for millennia before Chinese arrival. The characterization of Chen as bringing "civilization" to Taiwan reflects colonial mindsets that devalue non-Chinese cultures.

Some historians question whether Chen's focus on cultural and administrative development, while neglecting military modernization, contributed to the Kingdom of Tungning's eventual fall. The failed 1680 mainland campaign and the kingdom's ultimate defeat by Qing forces in 1683 suggest possible strategic shortcomings. Whether Chen bears responsibility for encouraging unrealistic mainland ambitions while failing to strengthen Taiwan's defenses remains debated.
