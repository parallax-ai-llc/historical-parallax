## Summary

Wasaburo Ooishi was a Japanese meteorologist who discovered the jet stream in the 1920s by tracking weather balloons over Japan. He published his findings in Esperanto, which limited their international impact. His discovery of these high-altitude, high-speed wind currents was decades ahead of Western recognition of the jet stream.
