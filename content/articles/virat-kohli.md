The former captain of the Indian national cricket team across all formats, Kohli has amassed 84 international centuries—second only to Sachin Tendulkar—and holds the record for most ODI centuries with 53[^2]. His aggressive batting style, exceptional fitness standards, and transformative leadership redefined Indian cricket's culture, particularly in overseas Test matches[^3]. Kohli's influence extends beyond the cricket field through his business ventures, brand endorsements, and his role as a global sporting icon who represents the confident, unapologetic India of the 21st century[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Virat Kohli was born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi into a middle-class Punjabi Hindu family[^5]. His father, Prem Nath Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, while his mother, Saroj Kohli, is a homemaker[^6]. He has an elder brother, Vikas, and an elder sister, Bhawna[^7]. The family resided in Uttam Nagar during his formative years before moving to Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar, where Kohli spent most of his childhood[^8].

Recognizing their son's potential and passion for cricket at an early age, Kohli's parents enrolled him at the West Delhi Cricket Academy when he was just nine years old[^9]. There, he began training under Rajkumar Sharma, who would play a pivotal role in shaping his cricketing career[^10]. Kohli also played matches at the Sumit Dogra Academy while receiving his early education from Vishal Bharti Public School[^11].

A defining moment in young Virat's life came on December 18, 2006, when his father died due to a cerebral attack[^12]. This tragic event had a profound impact on the teenager. According to his mother, Kohli's demeanor shifted noticeably after his father's death—he took on cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport[^13]. The very next day after his father's cremation, Kohli returned to the cricket field to continue a Ranji Trophy match, scoring 90 runs in a display of remarkable mental fortitude that would become characteristic of his career[^14].

Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh[^15]. During the 2003-04 season of the Polly Umrigar Trophy, the young batsman's leadership qualities were already evident when he was appointed captain of the Delhi U-15 team[^16]. These early experiences in domestic cricket laid the foundation for what would become one of the most illustrious careers in international cricket.

## Rise to Prominence

Virat Kohli's journey from promising domestic player to international superstar began with his captaincy of India's U-19 cricket team at the 2008 ICC U-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia[^17]. Leading from the front, Kohli amassed 235 runs at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer[^18]. His memorable century—a blistering 100 runs off just 74 balls against the West Indies U-19s in a group stage encounter—showcased the aggressive intent that would become his trademark[^19]. India defeated South Africa in the rain-affected final by 12 runs on the Duckworth-Lewis method, with Kohli lifting the trophy as captain[^20].

The U-19 World Cup triumph catapulted Kohli into national recognition, earning him a "surprise call-up" to the senior ODI squad for India's tour of Sri Lanka in August 2008[^21]. On August 18, 2008, just months after turning 20, Kohli made his international debut at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium[^22]. Opening the batting due to injuries to senior players, he managed only 12 runs before being dismissed by Nuwan Kulasekara in his first outing[^23]. However, he scored his first half-century in the fourth match of the series, demonstrating the temperament required at the highest level[^24].

Kohli's maiden ODI century came in December 2009 against Sri Lanka, marking the beginning of his record-breaking journey[^25]. His entry into Test cricket came in June 2011 against the West Indies, though his early Test career was marked by inconsistency, particularly against swing bowling[^26]. The turning point came during the 2014-15 tour of Australia, where Kohli became the first Indian to score four centuries in a single overseas Test series, amassing 692 runs at an average of 86.50[^27]. This series transformed perceptions of Kohli from a limited-overs specialist to a complete batsman capable of dominating in all conditions.

Simultaneously, Kohli's Indian Premier League (IPL) career flourished with Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), the only franchise he has represented since making his IPL debut shortly after the 2008 U-19 World Cup win[^28]. Appointed RCB captain in 2013, Kohli led the team to three IPL finals, though an elusive title remained just beyond reach[^29]. His loyalty to RCB, despite the lack of championships, has endeared him to fans and made him synonymous with the franchise[^30].

## Major Achievements

### International Cricket Records

Virat Kohli's statistical achievements place him among the all-time greats of cricket. With 84 centuries across all international formats—30 in Tests, 53 in ODIs, and 1 in T20Is—he stands second only to Sachin Tendulkar's 100 international centuries[^31]. In November 2023, Kohli surpassed his idol Tendulkar's record for most ODI centuries when he scored his 50th century in the format during the 2023 Cricket World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, finishing with 117 runs[^32].

His Test career, which concluded in 2025, saw him accumulate 9,230 runs across 123 matches with a batting average above 49[^33]. Kohli holds the record for the most double centuries (seven) by an Indian in Test cricket and is the only Indian to score seven Test centuries in Australia, surpassing even Sachin Tendulkar[^34]. He became the first batsman to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series, establishing himself as a master of converting starts into monumental scores[^35].

In ODI cricket, Kohli's dominance is particularly pronounced in chases. He holds the record for most ODI centuries while chasing with 27, earning him the moniker "Chase Master"[^36]. His record of 10 centuries against Sri Lanka represents the most centuries against any single opponent in ODI history[^37]. Kohli is the fastest batsman to reach multiple ODI milestones—8,000 runs (175 innings), 9,000 runs (194 innings), 10,000 runs, 11,000 runs (222 innings), 12,000 runs (242 innings), and 13,000 runs (267 innings)[^38]. In 2025, he became the fastest to 14,000 ODI runs during the Champions Trophy[^39].

### IPL Supremacy

Kohli's IPL career is equally decorated with records. As the only player to have scored over 8,000 IPL runs, he has amassed 8,661 runs across 267 matches at an average of 39.55[^40]. His eight IPL centuries—more than any other batsman—and 63 half-centuries (second only to David Warner's 66) demonstrate remarkable consistency[^41]. 

The 2016 IPL season stands as perhaps the greatest individual T20 performance in history. Kohli scored an astronomical 973 runs in just 16 games with an average of 81.08 and a strike rate of 152.03[^42]. He became the first and only player to score four centuries in a single IPL season, with scores of 100*, 108, 109, and 113—the last coming despite having seven stitches on his hand due to split webbing[^43]. That season, Kohli also formed a record 229-run partnership with AB de Villiers, the highest partnership for any wicket in T20 cricket history[^44]. For his extraordinary efforts, he was named the Most Valuable Player of IPL 2016[^45]. He won the Orange Cap (awarded to the tournament's leading run-scorer) twice, in 2016 and 2024[^46].

### Leadership Excellence

As captain of the Indian cricket team, Kohli revolutionized the team's culture and approach. Under his Test captaincy from 2014 to 2022, India won 40 out of 68 Tests, making him the fourth-most successful captain in the world behind Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting, and Steve Waugh[^47]. More significantly, Kohli became India's most successful Test captain with the most wins and three consecutive ICC Test Championship Mace retainments[^48]. He led India to a record five consecutive years as the No. 1 Test team from 2016 to 2021 and guided them to the final of the first-ever World Test Championship[^49].

Kohli's leadership was characterized by an aggressive, uncompromising approach and an emphasis on fitness that changed Indian cricket fundamentally[^50]. The yo-yo test results that ended several illustrious careers stand as testimony to his unforgiving work ethic and high standards[^51]. Under his captaincy, India achieved historic Test series victories in Australia (2018-19, winning 2-1), marking the first time an Indian team had won a Test series on Australian soil[^52]. This achievement buried decades of inferiority and established India as a formidable force in overseas conditions[^53].

### Awards and Honors

Kohli's achievements have been recognized with numerous awards. He has won ten ICC Awards—more than any player in international cricket history[^54]. He won the ICC ODI Player of the Year award four times (2012, 2017, 2018, and 2023) and was named Cricketer of the Decade for 2011 to 2020[^55]. In 2018, he became the first player to win all three major ICC awards in the same year: ICC Cricketer of the Year, ICC ODI Player of the Year, and ICC Test Player of the Year[^56]. That same year, he was ranked number one in all three international formats simultaneously, making him the only Indian cricketer to achieve this distinction[^57].

The Indian government has honored Kohli with the nation's highest sporting and civilian awards. He received the Arjuna Award in 2013 for outstanding performances in cricket, the Padma Shri (India's fourth-highest civilian award) in 2017, and the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award (now renamed Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award), India's highest sporting honor, in 2018[^58][^59][^60].

### World Cup Triumphs

Kohli was a crucial member of India's successful campaigns in multiple ICC tournaments. He was part of MS Dhoni's team that won the 2011 ODI World Cup, accumulating 282 runs in nine matches including a century[^61]. In the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy triumph in England, Kohli scored 176 runs in five games, including a match-winning 43 off 34 balls in the final against England[^62]. His Player of the Match performance in the 2024 T20 World Cup final—a knock of 76 off 59 balls that powered India to a competitive 176/7—secured India's second T20 World Cup title[^63]. Most recently, in 2025, he was instrumental in India's Champions Trophy victory, scoring a century and becoming the fastest to 14,000 ODI runs[^64].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his immense success, Virat Kohli's career has been punctuated by controversies stemming primarily from his aggressive on-field demeanor and occasional off-field statements. His passionate, confrontational style—while admired by many as competitive spirit—has frequently crossed the line according to critics.

### On-Field Aggression

One of the most memorable early incidents occurred during a 2013 IPL match between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Kolkata Knight Riders, when Kohli had an ugly argument with Gautam Gambhir[^65]. The confrontation required intervention from other players and set the tone for Kohli's reputation as a fiery competitor willing to engage in verbal duels.

During India's tour of Australia in 2012, Kohli showed his middle finger to Australian fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground during the second Test[^66]. While he later apologized, the incident highlighted the thin line between passion and inappropriate conduct. His battles with Australian crowds and players became a recurring theme throughout his career.

Perhaps one of the most controversial moments came during the third Test against South Africa in Cape Town in 2022. After a contentious DRS decision went against India—with Dean Elgar given not out on an LBW despite ball-tracking showing the ball clipping the stumps—Kohli lost his composure[^67]. Walking up to the stump microphone, he openly questioned the broadcaster, technology, and fairness of the game, with his comments broadcast worldwide[^68]. The incident drew criticism for undermining the spirit of the game and questioning the integrity of match officials.

In the 2025 IPL season, Kohli faced backlash for sledging young Punjab Kings player Musheer Khan, with critics questioning why an established superstar needed to target a rookie[^69]. The alleged mocking remark—"The guy who was delivering water bottles is now out to bat"—was seen by many as punching down rather than competing with peers[^70].

### Off-Field Controversies

Kohli's 2018 comments about Indian cricket fans sparked significant controversy. When questioned about fans criticizing player selection, Kohli suggested that those who didn't support Indian cricketers shouldn't come to watch them play[^71]. The perceived arrogance of telling paying fans to stay away drew widespread condemnation and forced clarifications.

His relationship with head coach Anil Kumble became a source of controversy in 2017. Reports indicated that Kohli refused to work with the legendary spinner, which ultimately forced Kumble to resign from his position despite a successful tenure[^72]. The incident raised questions about player power and the appropriate relationship between captain and coach.

A 2025 Instagram controversy erupted when Kohli accidentally liked a fan page post of actress Avneet Kaur on his wife Anushka Sharma's birthday[^73]. The incident went viral, forcing Kohli to issue a public Instagram story clarifying there was "no intent" and suggesting it may have been algorithm-triggered[^74]. While seemingly trivial, the episode illustrated the intense scrutiny every aspect of Kohli's life receives.

### Performance Criticisms

Beyond behavioral issues, Kohli has faced intense criticism for performance slumps, particularly in his later career. Former teammate Irfan Pathan raised significant concerns about Kohli's recent performances and commitment to self-improvement, questioning his place in the Indian Test team following the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2024-25[^75]. Critics pointed out that Kohli's Test average fell below 47 for the first time since 2016, with his average in first innings of Tests in 2024 being just 15[^76]. During the 2024-25 Australia series, aside from a lone century in Perth, Kohli managed only 190 runs across eight innings at an average of 23.75[^77].

Some commentators suggested Kohli was "beyond his best" and described the 36-year-old (at the time) as an "used bullet"[^78]. The criticism became so intense that defenders like AB de Villiers felt compelled to speak out, with de Villiers stating: "I feel Virat has taken unnecessary criticism over the past few seasons. He's batting incredibly well"[^79]. Former South African captain Graeme Smith called much of the criticism "completely unfair," noting that Kohli "single-handedly carried RCB's batting lineup when others around him weren't delivering"[^80].

Yet Kohli himself has acknowledged being hurt when critics go personal, distinguishing between legitimate performance critiques and attacks on his character or lifestyle[^81]. The nature of criticism he has faced—extending to questioning his dietary choices, fitness regime, and personal decisions—demonstrates the enormous pressure and scrutiny India's premier cricket icon endures.

## Personal Life

Virat Kohli's personal life has been subject to intense public interest, particularly his relationship with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma. The couple first met in 2013 during the shoot of a television commercial and began dating shortly thereafter[^82]. Their relationship became one of India's most high-profile celebrity romances, with fans dubbing them "Virushka."

On December 11, 2017, Kohli and Sharma married in an intimate ceremony in Tuscany, Italy, attended only by close friends and family[^83]. The couple has been remarkably successful in maintaining privacy despite their celebrity status. They have two children: daughter Vamika, born on January 11, 2021, and son Akaay, born on February 15, 2024[^84][^85].

Both Kohli and Sharma have been vocal about protecting their children's privacy. Sharma publicly criticized the Times Group for sharing unauthorized photographs of Vamika taken during a vacation and has repeatedly requested media and paparazzi to refrain from publishing pictures of their children[^86]. This stance reflects the couple's desire to give their children as normal a childhood as possible despite their parents' fame.

Anushka Sharma, born May 1, 1988, in Ayodhya, is an accomplished actress, producer, and was co-founder of the production company Clean Slate Filmz[^87]. Her own successful career means the couple represents a modern partnership of equals, each accomplished in their respective fields. In 2023, Sharma and Kohli announced their new philanthropic venture "SEVVA," with their daughter Vamika as a partner, focusing on charitable work[^88].

### Lifestyle and Philosophy

Kohli's transformation into a fitness icon has been one of the most significant aspects of his personal evolution. In 2018, during a tour of South Africa, Kohli faced health issues related to his cervical spine that were attributed to his high meat consumption leading to excessive stomach acidity[^89]. His body was producing too much uric acid, causing calcium to be pulled from his bones[^90]. This health scare prompted Kohli to adopt a predominantly plant-based diet, eliminating meat completely and reducing dairy consumption to minimal levels[^91].

His current diet is 90% free from dairy and animal protein, with lentils, legumes, tofu, and quinoa serving as staple protein sources[^92]. Approximately 90% of his food is steamed or boiled with minimal seasoning—only salt, pepper, and lime[^93]. Kohli has completely eliminated refined sugar from his diet and maintains a low-carb, high-protein composition to keep his body fat percentage low while ensuring energy and agility[^94]. He drinks 3 to 4 cups of green tea with lemon daily and prefers Evian natural spring water for hydration[^95].

His fitness regime is equally rigorous. Kohli works out five days each week, combining weights and cardio workouts to build lean, strong muscles[^96]. During the off-season, he spends four hours daily in the gym across two sessions, maintaining at least one and a half hours of training during the playing season[^97]. This commitment to fitness has not only extended his career but fundamentally changed standards across Indian cricket.

Kohli's personal philosophy centers on what he calls "betterment"—the concept of becoming better each day than one's former self[^98]. This drive for continuous improvement manifests in his famous quotes: "Self-belief and hard work will always earn you success" and "Irrespective of whether you have talent or not, one has to work hard. Just being talented doesn't mean anything; you can end up wasting it before you realize"[^99][^100]. His approach to pressure is equally telling: "I love playing under pressure. In fact, if there's no pressure, then I'm not in the perfect zone" and "Pressure is something you feel when you don't know what you're doing"[^101][^102].

### Business Ventures

Beyond cricket, Kohli has built an impressive business empire. His One8 brand started as a premium athleisure line and diversified into a chain of restaurants across India called "One8 Commune"[^103]. In a recent major move, Kohli sold the One8 lifestyle brand to sportswear start-up Agilitas and invested an additional ₹40 crore, signing an exclusive endorsement deal that bars him from endorsing other sports brands[^104].

His investment portfolio is extensive. Kohli partnered with Chisel Fitness and CSE in 2015, investing ₹90 crore in establishing fitness centers across India[^105]. He's an athlete-investor in wellness brand Hyperice, which he also represents as global brand ambassador[^106]. In the fashion industry, Kohli co-created WROGN, a casual wear brand offering streetwear-style clothing, footwear, and accessories, backed by investors including the Aditya Birla Group and Flipkart[^107].

Other notable investments include a ₹2.2 crore investment in Digit Insurance (alongside wife Anushka Sharma), a 12% stake in FC Goa football club, ₹19.3 crore in Universal Sportsbiz Pvt Ltd (USPL), and an investor-ambassador role with Rage Coffee[^108][^109][^110][^111]. Today, Kohli reportedly endorses more than 30 brands across multiple sectors, including HSBC (finance), Vivo (technology), Blue Star (consumer durables), and Myntra (e-commerce)[^112]. His partnership with MRF, renewed in 2017 for eight years at approximately ₹100 crore, made him the only Indian athlete at the time to have two ₹100-crore-plus endorsement deals (the other being with Puma)[^113].

## Legacy

Virat Kohli's impact on cricket extends far beyond statistics and records. According to former Australian captain Greg Chappell, Kohli "has been Indian cricket's most influential figure" because "he changed not just results but mindsets"[^114]. This transformation of Indian cricket's culture represents perhaps his most enduring legacy.

### Cultural Transformation

Before Kohli's rise to prominence, Indian cricket teams were often perceived as talented but mentally fragile, particularly in overseas conditions. Kohli fundamentally altered this narrative by building a culture that emphasized preparation, discipline, fitness, and fearlessness[^115]. His insistence on rigorous fitness standards revolutionized the sport in India—before his leadership, fitness was not prioritized to the same degree[^116]. The yo-yo test became a non-negotiable requirement, ending several careers but raising the overall athletic standards of the team[^117].

His legacy is truly reflected in the fitter, tougher, and more combative Indian team that believed in its ability to win anywhere in the world[^118]. Under his captaincy, India achieved historic Test series victories in Australia, South Africa, and England, fundamentally changing perceptions of Indian cricket's capabilities abroad[^119]. As observers noted, his leadership marked a shift in how India competed overseas—with aggression, belief, and a refusal to settle for second best[^120].

### Blueprint for Modern Cricketers

Kohli became the blueprint for the modern Indian cricketer—relentlessly professional, obsessively fit, and mentally ironclad[^121]. His emphasis on fitness and aggressive yet competitive gameplay set new standards that future generations would be expected to meet[^122]. The way he valued both skill and leadership brought unity and professionalism to the team, setting a precedent for future generations in handling high-pressure situations[^123].

He inspired a generation of cricketers to treat Test cricket as the ultimate stage of character and skill, taking pride in the white uniform at a time when T20 leagues were threatening the format's relevance[^124]. His impact on Indian cricket will be felt for decades to come, as young cricketers model their approach on his dedication, preparation, and unwavering self-belief[^125].

### Symbol of Modern India

Beyond cricket, Kohli symbolizes the self-assured, unapologetic India of the 21st century[^126]. His confidence, assertiveness, and refusal to conform to traditional expectations of deference reflect broader changes in Indian society. He represents a generation of successful Indians who are confident about their abilities without apologizing, being aggressively assertive at all times[^127]. This cultural significance extends his influence beyond sports into the broader national consciousness.

### Enduring Impact

In every sense of the word, "King Kohli" reigned over an era of Indian cricket, and his influence will persist long after the roar of the crowd has faded[^128]. The BCCI's congratulatory message upon his Test retirement acknowledged his "legendary career" and transformative impact[^129]. Whether measured by records broken, matches won, standards raised, or mindsets changed, Virat Kohli's legacy as one of cricket's all-time greats and Indian cricket's most influential figure appears secure.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Cricket experts and former players have overwhelmingly praised Kohli's contributions to the sport. Greg Chappell, who controversially coached India during Kohli's early career, later wrote that Kohli redefined expectations, challenged conventions, and became Indian cricket's most influential figure by changing not just results but the very mindset of Indian cricket[^130]. This assessment focuses on Kohli's cultural impact rather than merely his statistical achievements.

AB de Villiers, Kohli's longtime RCB teammate and close friend, has been a vocal defender, stating: "I feel Virat has taken unnecessary criticism over the past few seasons. He's batting incredibly well"[^131]. De Villiers' perspective as someone who witnessed Kohli's preparation and dedication firsthand carries significant weight in assessing his true value beyond temporary form slumps.

Former South African captain Graeme Smith similarly called criticism of Kohli "completely unfair," noting that "he single-handedly carried RCB's batting lineup when others around him weren't delivering"[^132]. This defense highlights Kohli's ability to perform despite lacking the support systems available to players in more balanced teams.

Scholars and cricket historians emphasize Kohli's role in globalizing cricket's appeal and modernizing its culture. His emphasis on fitness transformed not just Indian cricket but influenced global standards, with other cricket boards adopting similar rigorous physical requirements[^133]. His success in all three formats during an era of increasing specialization demonstrated a versatility that few contemporaries could match[^134].

The BCCI's official statement upon his Test retirement praised his "legendary Test career" and acknowledged the transformative impact of his leadership and batting prowess[^135]. The organization he served recognized that Kohli's contributions extended beyond individual milestones to fundamental changes in how Indian cricket operated and competed.

### Negative Views

Critics of Kohli focus on several perceived shortcomings despite his statistical success. Former teammate Irfan Pathan questioned Kohli's commitment to self-improvement in his later career, asking whether the team deserved a senior player whose performances had declined significantly[^136]. This critique highlights concerns that Kohli's status and past achievements may have led to selection based on reputation rather than current form.

Statistical analysts point to concerning trends in Kohli's later Test career. His Test average falling below 47 for the first time since 2016, combined with a first-innings average of just 15 in 2024, suggested a batsman struggling with technical issues he once mastered[^137]. During the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, aside from a century in Perth, Kohli managed only 190 runs across eight innings at an average of 23.75—a stark decline for someone who previously dominated Australian bowling[^138].

Some commentators have suggested Kohli is now "beyond his best," describing the aging champion as an "used bullet"[^139]. This harsh assessment reflects frustration that Kohli's decline coincided with India's need for experienced players to guide a transition to a new generation. Critics argue he should have stepped aside earlier to allow younger players opportunities.

The lack of IPL championships despite Kohli's individual brilliance at RCB has been cited as evidence of shortcomings in his tactical captaincy and team-building abilities[^140]. While he transformed India's Test culture and overseas competitiveness, his tenure as white-ball captain did not produce ICC trophy victories, with India falling short in the 2017 Champions Trophy final and 2019 World Cup semi-final[^141].

Behavioral criticisms persist regarding Kohli's on-field aggression and confrontational approach. Critics who have played cricket at the highest level have gone to "gutter level" to criticize Kohli, suggesting his behavior sometimes crossed lines of sportsmanship[^142]. The sledging incidents, confrontations with umpires and match officials, and perceived arrogance in interviews have provided ammunition for those arguing that Kohli's competitiveness sometimes manifested as poor sportsmanship.
