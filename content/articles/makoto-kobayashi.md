## Summary

Makoto Kobayashi is a Japanese physicist who shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics with Toshihide Maskawa for the discovery of the origin of broken symmetry that predicts the existence of at least three families of quarks. The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix describes quark mixing and CP violation. Their work helped explain why the universe contains more matter than antimatter.
