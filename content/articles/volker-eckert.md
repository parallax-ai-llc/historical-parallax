## Summary
Volker Eckert was a German long-haul truck driver and serial killer who murdered at least six women across Europe between 1974 and 2006. He strangled women in Spain, France, and Germany. He was identified through DNA and hanged himself in his cell in 2007.

## Early Life
Born July 1, 1959, in Plauen, East Germany. He worked as a long-haul truck driver, which gave him mobility across Europe. He had a previous conviction for attempted murder in 1987. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1974 and 2006, Eckert murdered at least six women in Germany, France, and Spain. He strangled his victims, all women, often sex workers he encountered during his trucking routes. His mobility across European borders made detection difficult. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
In 2007, DNA evidence linked Eckert to murders in multiple countries through the European DNA database. He was arrested and confessed. He hanged himself in his cell at Bayreuth prison on July 2, 2007, before trial. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered at least six women across three countries [^5]
