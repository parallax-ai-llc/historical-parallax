## Overview

The Hindenburg disaster occurred on May 6, 1937, when the German passenger airship LZ 129 Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey. Of the 97 people aboard, 35 died, along with one ground worker. The disaster was captured on film and recorded by radio reporter Herbert Morrison, whose anguished cry "Oh, the humanity!" became one of the most famous phrases in broadcast history. Though most aboard survived, the spectacular images of the burning airship ended the era of rigid airships as passenger transport. To this day, the exact cause of the fire remains debated.

## The Hindenburg

### Pride of Nazi Germany

**Specifications:**
- Length: 804 feet (245 meters)—longer than three Boeing 747s
- Diameter: 135 feet (41 meters)
- Gross lift: 112 tons
- Cruising speed: 78 mph (126 km/h)
- Passenger capacity: 50-72
- Crew: 40-61

**Luxury:**
- Dining room, lounge, writing room
- Promenade decks with windows
- Smoking room (ironic given hydrogen)
- Grand piano, showers

**Propaganda:**
Bore Nazi swastikas on tail fins. Flew over Berlin Olympics (1936). Symbol of German technological prowess.

### Hydrogen vs. Helium

**Fatal Choice:**
Designed for helium (non-flammable), but U.S. controlled world's helium supply and refused to sell to Nazi Germany.

Hindenburg flew with 7 million cubic feet of hydrogen—highly flammable.

## The Flight

### Final Voyage

**Departed:** Frankfurt, Germany, May 3, 1937
**Destination:** Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey
**Passengers:** 36
**Crew:** 61
**Route:** Transatlantic crossing (scheduled ~65 hours)

### Delay at Lakehurst

**May 6, 1937:**
Storm over New Jersey. Captain Max Pruss circled for hours waiting for weather to clear.

**7:00 PM:**
Conditions improved. Pruss began landing approach.

**7:21 PM:**
Landing lines dropped to ground crew.

## The Disaster

### 7:25 PM

**Ignition:**
Fire erupted near the stern, at top of the ship (near tail fin).

**32 Seconds:**
Entire ship consumed by flames and crashed to ground in 32-37 seconds.

### The Scene

**Witnessed by:**
- Hundreds of spectators
- News cameras
- Newsreel crews

**Herbert Morrison's Broadcast:**
Radio reporter Herbert Morrison was recording arrival for WLS Chicago:

> "It's burst into flames! Get out of the way, please! It's burning, bursting into flames and is falling on the mooring mast... This is terrible, this is one of the worst catastrophes in the world... Oh, the humanity!"

His emotional narration, paired with newsreel footage, created one of the most powerful media moments of the 20th century.

## Survivors and Casualties

### Statistics

**Aboard:** 97 (36 passengers, 61 crew)
**Survived:** 62 (23 passengers, 39 crew)
**Died:** 35 aboard + 1 ground crew = 36 total

### How Anyone Survived

**Hydrogen Burns Upward:**
Fire rose quickly. Those on lower decks or who jumped early had time to escape.

**Speed of Descent:**
Ship fell relatively slowly (hydrogen provides lift even while burning).

### Notable Survivors

- **Werner Franz (14):** Cabin boy. Water tank burst over him, protecting from flames. Jumped out window.
- **Captain Max Pruss:** Severely burned, survived.
- **Captain Ernst Lehmann:** Walked away from wreckage, died next day.

## Cause of the Fire

### Investigations

**German and American Investigations:**
Both concluded fire occurred, but did not definitively determine cause.

### Theories

**1. Static Spark + Hydrogen Leak:**
Most accepted theory. Static electricity (storm conditions) ignited hydrogen leaking from stern gas cell.

**2. Incendiary Paint:**
Addison Bain (NASA, 1990s) proposed skin coating (iron oxide + aluminum) ignited. Theory largely debunked—paint burns but not explosively.

**3. Sabotage:**
Some suspected anti-Nazi sabotage. Never proven. Hugo Eckener (airship designer) believed it.

**4. Engine Backfire:**
Discredited.

## End of Airships

### Psychological Impact

Though 62 survived (64%), images of flaming airship terrified public.

**Contrast:**
Airplane crashes of era killed at similar rates but weren't filmed dramatically.

### Aftermath

**Hindenburg's Sister Ship:**
LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II built but never carried passengers.

**Passenger Airship Era Ended:**
No more transatlantic passenger airships flew. Airplanes took over long-distance travel.

## Legacy

### "Oh, the humanity!"

Morrison's phrase entered lexicon as expression of tragic witnessing.

### Media Milestone

First major disaster captured live on audio. Film footage shown globally. Demonstrated power of media to shape perception.

### Zeppelin Company

Continued making blimps (non-rigid) for advertising, observation. No more rigid airships.
