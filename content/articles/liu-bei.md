## Summary

Liu Bei (161–223 CE) was a pivotal warlord and political leader during the tumultuous final decades of the Eastern Han Dynasty and the subsequent Three Kingdoms period in ancient China. Rising from humble origins as a mat-weaver and sandal-seller, he eventually established himself as the founding emperor of the Shu Han state, claiming legitimacy as a distant descendant of the Han imperial family. His life and career have been heavily romanticized in Chinese literature, particularly in the 14th-century historical novel _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, which portrays him as a virtuous and benevolent ruler committed to restoring the Han Dynasty. Liu Bei's enduring legacy rests on his reputation for righteousness, his famous sworn brotherhood with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and his role as one of the three major powers competing for control of China during one of its most legendary historical periods.

## Early Life and Background

Liu Bei was born in 161 CE in Zhuo County, Zhuo Commandery (in present-day Hebei Province), during the reign of Emperor Huan of the Eastern Han Dynasty[^1]. According to traditional accounts, he was a descendant of Liu Sheng, a prince of the Western Han Dynasty and son of Emperor Jing, though this lineage placed him so far removed from the imperial succession that his family had long since fallen into poverty[^2]. His father, Liu Hong, died when Liu Bei was young, leaving him and his mother to survive through humble means—selling straw sandals and weaving mats for a living[^3].

Despite his impoverished circumstances, Liu Bei received an education under Lu Zhi, a renowned Confucian scholar who would later become an important official and military commander[^4]. This education gave Liu Bei exposure to classical learning and administrative principles, though historical sources suggest he was more interested in military pursuits and chivalrous ideals than scholarly endeavors[^5]. According to the _Records of the Three Kingdoms_ (_Sanguozhi_), Liu Bei was described as a man of few words who treated others with respect and showed little emotion on his face, attracting a following of young men despite his poverty[^6].

The formative event of Liu Bei's early life was the outbreak of the Yellow Turban Rebellion in 184 CE, a massive peasant uprising that threatened to topple the already weakening Han Dynasty[^7]. Responding to the government's call for volunteers to suppress the rebels, Liu Bei organized a small military force with financial backing from two local merchants[^8]. It was during this period that he formed his legendary sworn brotherhood with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, two warriors who would become his most trusted generals and closest companions[^9]. The famous "Oath of the Peach Garden," though likely a later literary embellishment, symbolizes their commitment to mutual loyalty and their shared goal of restoring order to the empire[^10].

Liu Bei distinguished himself in the campaigns against the Yellow Turbans, earning official recognition and his first military appointments[^11]. However, these early positions were relatively minor, and he spent the next decade navigating the dangerous political landscape of the collapsing Han Dynasty, serving under various regional warlords including Gongsun Zan and Tao Qian[^12]. His early career was marked by frequent setbacks, territorial losses, and periods of refuge under more powerful figures, establishing a pattern of resilience and opportunism that would characterize his rise to power[^13].

## Rise to Power

Liu Bei's ascent from minor military officer to major warlord was a prolonged and turbulent process spanning nearly three decades. After serving under the warlord Gongsun Zan in the early 190s, Liu Bei received control of Pingyuan County, giving him his first independent power base[^14]. However, his position remained precarious as northern China fell increasingly under the domination of the powerful warlord Cao Cao, who controlled the Han imperial court and claimed to act in its name[^15].

A crucial turning point came in 201 CE when Liu Bei, after suffering defeats and losing his territories, sought refuge with Liu Biao, the governor of Jing Province in central China[^16]. Although treated well by Liu Biao, Liu Bei held no real authority and spent several years in a state of dependency[^17]. This changed dramatically in 207 CE when Liu Bei made three personal visits to the wilderness cottage of Zhuge Liang, a brilliant strategist and political advisor[^18]. The famous "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage" resulted in Zhuge Liang entering Liu Bei's service, providing him with the strategic vision and administrative expertise he had previously lacked[^19].

Zhuge Liang's first major contribution was the formulation of the "Longzhong Plan," a strategic blueprint that advised Liu Bei to secure Jing Province and Yi Province (modern Sichuan), creating a two-pronged base from which to eventually challenge Cao Cao for control of China[^20]. The plan recognized that Liu Bei could not compete with Cao Cao's superior resources in direct confrontation but could establish a strong regional foundation by controlling the strategically valuable and agriculturally rich provinces of central and southwestern China[^21].

The opportunity to implement this strategy came in 208 CE when Cao Cao launched a massive invasion of Jing Province after Liu Biao's death[^22]. Initially forced to retreat with thousands of refugee followers, Liu Bei formed a crucial alliance with the warlord Sun Quan, who controlled the prosperous territories south of the Yangtze River[^23]. This alliance culminated in the Battle of Red Cliffs (also called the Battle of Chibi), one of the most famous military engagements in Chinese history[^24]. Though the specific details remain debated by historians, the battle resulted in a decisive defeat for Cao Cao's forces, primarily due to a fire attack on his naval fleet[^25]. This victory fundamentally altered the balance of power in China, preventing Cao Cao from unifying the country and allowing Liu Bei and Sun Quan to establish independent power bases[^26].

Following Red Cliffs, Liu Bei secured control over significant portions of Jing Province, though the exact territories and the nature of his authority remained points of contention with his ally Sun Quan[^27]. Between 212 and 214 CE, Liu Bei undertook the conquest of Yi Province, ostensibly responding to an invitation from its governor Liu Zhang to help defend against external threats, but ultimately turning against his host and seizing control of the province for himself[^28]. This conquest, though strategically necessary according to the Longzhong Plan, marked Liu Bei's transition from a relatively powerless refugee to a major regional power controlling some of China's most defensible and productive territories[^29].

By 219 CE, Liu Bei had achieved the height of his military success, capturing the strategic Hanzhong Commandery from Cao Cao's forces after a prolonged campaign[^30]. This victory secured the northern approaches to Yi Province and led Liu Bei to proclaim himself "King of Hanzhong," a title that implied his claim to eventually restore the Han Dynasty[^31]. However, this triumph was soon overshadowed by the death of Guan Yu, who was captured and executed by Sun Quan's forces after losing Jing Province in a devastating military reversal[^32].

## Major Achievements

Liu Bei's most significant achievement was the establishment of the Shu Han state in 221 CE, making him one of the three major powers dividing China during the Three Kingdoms period[^33]. Following the death of the last Han emperor and Cao Cao's son Cao Pi's establishment of the Wei Dynasty in 220 CE, Liu Bei declared himself emperor, positioning his regime as the legitimate continuation of the Han Dynasty[^34]. This claim to legitimacy, based on his purported descent from the Han imperial family and his position as a former Han official, became central to his political identity and propaganda[^35].

Under Liu Bei's rule, the Shu Han state implemented effective administrative systems that enabled a relatively small population base to support prolonged military campaigns and maintain independence against the much larger Wei state to the north[^36]. While much credit for this administrative success belongs to Zhuge Liang and other talented advisors, Liu Bei's ability to identify, recruit, and retain capable officials was itself a significant accomplishment[^37]. His government attracted numerous talented individuals who might otherwise have served other regimes, drawn by his reputation for virtue and the ideological appeal of his claim to restore the Han Dynasty[^38].

Liu Bei's military achievements, while mixed in their ultimate results, included several notable victories. His participation in the alliance that defeated Cao Cao at Red Cliffs prevented the unification of China under Wei control and established the three-way division of power that defined the era[^39]. His conquest of Yi Province demonstrated both military capability and strategic patience, as he carefully cultivated relationships within the province before making his move[^40]. The capture of Hanzhong in 219 CE marked his greatest military triumph, securing a crucial buffer zone against northern invasion and validating his status as a major power[^41].

Beyond military and political accomplishments, Liu Bei's greatest achievement may have been his success in cultivating a powerful personal image and legend. Historical sources consistently emphasize his ability to inspire loyalty and devotion among his followers, even during periods of defeat and hardship[^42]. The _Records of the Three Kingdoms_ notes numerous instances of Liu Bei's officers and soldiers refusing to abandon him despite opportunities to serve more successful warlords[^43]. This personal charisma and the loyalty it generated became a crucial asset, allowing him to recover from repeated setbacks that would have ended the careers of less compelling leaders[^44].

Liu Bei's patronage of Confucian scholars and his public commitment to restoring the Han Dynasty created an ideological foundation for his state that resonated with contemporary political culture[^45]. While other warlords explicitly rejected Han legitimacy or paid it mere lip service, Liu Bei maintained a consistent rhetorical commitment to restoration, appealing to those who viewed the Han Dynasty's collapse as a civilizational crisis requiring rectification[^46]. This ideological positioning, though it did not prevent his state's eventual defeat, helped establish the narrative framework through which later generations would understand the Three Kingdoms period[^47].

The establishment of stable governance in Shu Han territories, particularly in Yi Province, represented another significant achievement. Despite the region's distance from traditional Chinese cultural centers and its history of independence from central control, Liu Bei and his advisors successfully integrated it into their state system[^48]. They implemented agricultural reforms, maintained infrastructure, and created administrative structures that would continue to function effectively under Zhuge Liang's regency after Liu Bei's death[^49].

Liu Bei's ability to maintain the crucial alliance with Sun Quan for extended periods, despite inherent conflicts over territory and resources, demonstrated considerable diplomatic skill[^50]. Though this alliance eventually fractured, leading to catastrophic consequences for Liu Bei's regime, his success in balancing competition and cooperation with Sun Quan for over a decade enabled both powers to resist Cao Cao's attempts at unification[^51].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his generally positive historical reputation, Liu Bei's career included numerous controversial actions and decisions that historians have debated for centuries. The most significant criticism concerns his betrayal of Liu Zhang, the governor of Yi Province who had invited Liu Bei to help defend against external threats[^52]. After accepting Liu Zhang's hospitality and support, Liu Bei turned against his benefactor and seized control of the province through military force[^53]. This act of treachery contradicts the image of Liu Bei as a paragon of Confucian virtue and loyalty, revealing a ruthless pragmatism that characterized many of his strategic decisions[^54].

Contemporary sources and later historians have questioned the sincerity of Liu Bei's claim to restore the Han Dynasty. Chen Shou, the author of the _Records of the Three Kingdoms_ and a former Shu Han official, subtly criticizes Liu Bei's actions while maintaining a generally favorable portrayal[^55]. Modern historians have noted that Liu Bei's establishment of an independent imperial regime in 221 CE, while rhetorically framed as continuing the Han Dynasty, effectively represented the creation of a new dynasty competing for control of China[^56]. His actions often prioritized personal power accumulation over genuine restoration of Han authority[^57].

Liu Bei's decision to launch a massive military campaign against Sun Quan in 221-222 CE to avenge Guan Yu's death stands as his greatest strategic blunder and has generated substantial historical criticism[^58]. Despite warnings from his advisors, including Zhuge Liang and Zhao Yun, Liu Bei committed the bulk of his military forces to an invasion of Sun Quan's territory, culminating in the catastrophic Battle of Xiaoting (also called the Battle of Yiling)[^59]. The campaign resulted in devastating losses, including the destruction of most of Shu Han's main army and the deaths of numerous experienced generals[^60]. This disastrous defeat, driven primarily by Liu Bei's emotional desire for revenge rather than strategic calculation, permanently weakened Shu Han and eliminated any realistic possibility of unifying China[^61].

Historical sources suggest Liu Bei could be cruel and ruthless when politically convenient. The _Sanguozhi_ records instances where Liu Bei ordered executions and engaged in violence that contradicted his cultivated image of benevolence[^62]. His treatment of rivals and potential threats within his own territories demonstrated the same hard-edged pragmatism common to other warlords of his era, despite his reputation for virtue[^63].

Critics have also pointed to Liu Bei's frequent territorial losses and military defeats throughout his career as evidence of limited strategic and tactical ability[^64]. Before the conquest of Yi Province, Liu Bei's career was characterized by repeated failures to maintain independent power bases, often requiring him to seek refuge under other warlords[^65]. While his supporters attribute these setbacks to unfavorable circumstances and superior enemy forces, critics argue they reflect genuine limitations in Liu Bei's military capabilities[^66].

Some historians have questioned whether Liu Bei's personal qualities were truly as exceptional as traditional accounts suggest, arguing that much of his positive reputation derives from literary embellishment rather than historical fact[^67]. The _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, written over a millennium after Liu Bei's death, significantly amplified and exaggerated his virtues while minimizing his flaws, creating a semi-mythological figure that may bear limited resemblance to the historical individual[^68].

The allocation of offices and rewards in Liu Bei's regime has also drawn criticism for favoring those from his home region and longtime followers over more qualified candidates from Yi Province and other newly acquired territories[^69]. This favoritism created tensions within his administration and may have limited the regime's effectiveness and stability[^70].

## Personal Life

Historical sources provide limited but intriguing details about Liu Bei's personal life and character. He was married at least four times, though the exact number and identities of all his wives remain uncertain due to incomplete historical records[^71]. His first two wives were captured when Cao Cao's forces defeated him at Xiaopei, and their ultimate fates are unknown[^72]. His most historically significant marriage was to Lady Sun, a sister of the warlord Sun Quan, arranged as part of the political alliance between their two powers[^73]. This marriage, while politically motivated, reportedly involved genuine affection, though Lady Sun eventually returned to her brother's territory when relations between Liu Bei and Sun Quan deteriorated[^74].

Liu Bei's principal empress was Lady Gan, who bore his first son Liu Shan, though she died before Liu Bei proclaimed himself emperor[^75]. After her death, Lady Wu became empress and was known for her virtue and adherence to proper protocol[^76]. These marriages reflected both personal preference and political necessity, as marriage alliances were crucial tools of statecraft during the Three Kingdoms period[^77].

Contemporary descriptions of Liu Bei's physical appearance have become famous in Chinese cultural memory. The _Records of the Three Kingdoms_ describes him as having arms long enough that when standing, his hands reached below his knees, and ears so large he could see them by turning his head—features interpreted as auspicious signs of imperial destiny[^78]. While these descriptions likely contain elements of embellishment meant to portray Liu Bei as physically remarkable, they established iconic visual characteristics that persisted in artistic representations for centuries[^79].

Liu Bei's personality, as portrayed in historical sources, combined accessibility with carefully maintained emotional control. He was known for weeping easily, particularly when parting with allies or confronting setbacks, a characteristic that demonstrated emotional engagement while potentially serving as a calculated political tool to display his humanity and sincerity[^80]. His ability to remain calm and composed in most situations, showing little emotion on his face, contrasted with these displays of tears and created an image of depth and complexity[^81].

Relationships with his sworn brothers Guan Yu and Zhang Fei dominated Liu Bei's personal life and emotional attachments. Historical accounts suggest these bonds, while possibly formalized through actual oath-taking ceremonies, represented genuine affection and loyalty that transcended typical political alliances[^82]. Liu Bei reportedly shared sleeping quarters with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei during his early career, treating them as brothers rather than subordinates, though he maintained proper protocol in public settings[^83]. The depth of his grief at Guan Yu's death, which motivated his disastrous campaign against Sun Quan, suggests the emotional intensity of these relationships[^84].

Liu Bei's lifestyle, even after achieving power and wealth, reportedly retained elements of his humble origins. Unlike some warlords who indulged in luxury, historical accounts portray Liu Bei as relatively modest in his personal habits, using this restraint to reinforce his image as a virtuous leader focused on public welfare rather than private pleasure[^85]. Whether this modesty was genuine or performed for political effect remains debatable, but it contributed to his reputation and appeal among followers[^86].

His relationships with his sons, particularly Liu Shan who succeeded him as emperor of Shu Han, receive limited attention in historical sources. Liu Bei's famous deathbed instruction to Liu Shan to consult Zhuge Liang on all matters and his statement that Zhuge Liang should replace Liu Shan if the latter proved incompetent suggests both genuine concern for his state's survival and possible doubts about his son's capabilities[^87].

## Legacy

Liu Bei's legacy extends far beyond his actual historical achievements, making him one of the most culturally significant figures in Chinese civilization. His image as a virtuous, benevolent ruler committed to righteousness became an archetype of ideal leadership in Chinese political culture, influencing how subsequent generations understood the relationship between moral character and political legitimacy[^88]. The Confucian values he purportedly embodied—loyalty, benevolence, righteousness, and humility—made him a model figure in traditional Chinese ethics and political philosophy[^89].

The _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_, written by Luo Guanzhong in the 14th century, transformed Liu Bei from a historical figure into a legendary hero[^90]. This novel, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, shaped popular understanding of the Three Kingdoms period for centuries and remains enormously influential in Chinese-speaking communities worldwide[^91]. The novel's portrayal of Liu Bei as the embodiment of virtue, contrasted with Cao Cao's cunning and Sun Quan's opportunism, created a moral framework that dominated cultural interpretations of the era[^92].

Liu Bei's influence extends throughout East Asian popular culture, appearing in countless adaptations including operas, television series, films, video games, and other media[^93]. The story of the Three Kingdoms, with Liu Bei as a central protagonist, has been adapted and reinterpreted continuously for over seven centuries, making these characters and narratives among the most widely known in Chinese cultural history[^94]. Modern video game franchises like _Dynasty Warriors_ and _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_ have introduced Liu Bei and his contemporaries to global audiences, extending his cultural influence beyond traditional Chinese cultural spheres[^95].

In political discourse, Liu Bei has been invoked as both a positive and negative example by various Chinese political movements and leaders. Traditional Confucian scholars praised him as an exemplar of virtue in leadership, while revolutionaries and reformers sometimes criticized him as representing failed traditionalism[^96]. During the Cultural Revolution, Liu Bei and the _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_ were subject to political reinterpretation, with some interpretations criticizing the novel's "feudal ideology" while others found revolutionary lessons in its narratives of struggle and resistance[^97].

The concept of the "Peach Garden Oath" attributed to Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei became a powerful symbol of loyalty, brotherhood, and honorable alliance in Chinese culture[^98]. This oath, while likely a later literary invention rather than historical fact, influenced how Chinese culture understood personal loyalty and created a model for sworn brotherhoods that was emulated by various organizations, including secret societies and fraternal groups[^99].

Temples and shrines dedicated to Liu Bei exist throughout China, Taiwan, and other Chinese communities, often alongside those honoring Guan Yu (who became deified as a god of war and righteousness)[^100]. These religious and commemorative sites reflect Liu Bei's transition from historical figure to cultural icon and object of veneration[^101].

Liu Bei's legacy in strategic and military thought is more mixed. While the Longzhong Plan attributed to his advisor Zhuge Liang is studied as an example of long-term strategic planning, Liu Bei's own tactical and strategic decisions receive limited attention in military literature compared to contemporaries like Cao Cao[^102]. His disastrous Xiaoting campaign serves as a cautionary example of how personal emotion can override strategic judgment[^103].

The Shu Han state he founded survived until 263 CE, outlasting Liu Bei himself by four decades but ultimately falling to Wei forces[^104]. Despite its eventual defeat, Shu Han's resistance against the numerically and economically superior Wei regime became a narrative of virtuous struggle against overwhelming odds, reinforcing Liu Bei's image as a tragic hero[^105].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and scholars who view Liu Bei favorably emphasize his exceptional personal qualities and moral character as distinguishing features in an era dominated by ruthless warlords. Chen Shou, despite his occasional subtle criticisms, overall portrays Liu Bei positively in the _Records of the Three Kingdoms_, describing him as magnanimous, skilled at treating people well, and possessing the demeanor of a true leader[^106]. Chen Shou particularly emphasizes Liu Bei's ability to recognize and employ talented individuals, suggesting this capacity for identifying capable advisors and generals was his greatest strength[^107].

Pei Songzhi, the 5th-century commentator on the _Records of the Three Kingdoms_, defends Liu Bei against various criticisms, arguing that his actions must be understood within the context of his era's political necessities[^108]. Pei argues that Liu Bei's seizure of Yi Province, while morally questionable, was strategically essential for survival and that Liu Bei showed considerable restraint compared to other warlords who committed far worse atrocities[^109].

Traditional Confucian scholars have long praised Liu Bei as exemplifying the principle that virtue, rather than mere military force, constitutes the foundation of legitimate rule[^110]. His humble origins and rise to imperial status through personal merit rather than inherited privilege made him an appealing figure for those who believed in social mobility and the importance of character over birth[^111]. The Ming Dynasty scholar Li Zhi argued that Liu Bei's sincerity and genuine benevolence were authentic rather than calculated, pointing to his consistent behavior across decades as evidence of true virtue rather than political performance[^112].

Modern historians sympathetic to Liu Bei emphasize his genuine commitment to Confucian values and his sincere belief in the importance of restoring Han Dynasty legitimacy. Scholars such as Rafe de Crespigny have argued that Liu Bei's political ideology was not mere propaganda but reflected deeply held convictions about proper governance and legitimate authority[^113]. These historians suggest that Liu Bei's actions, while sometimes pragmatic and self-serving, were constrained by his ideological commitments in ways that distinguished him from purely opportunistic warlords[^114].

Defenders of Liu Bei's military reputation argue that his repeated setbacks resulted primarily from consistently facing more powerful opponents rather than from personal incompetence[^115]. They note that Liu Bei successfully maintained military resistance against superior forces for decades, preserving his regime and eventually establishing a state that survived forty years after his death[^116]. His conquest of Yi Province and capture of Hanzhong demonstrated genuine military capability when properly supported by adequate resources and sound advice[^117].

Scholars have also praised Liu Bei's political acumen in maintaining the alliance with Sun Quan for extended periods despite inherent conflicts, suggesting sophisticated diplomatic skills[^118]. His ability to cultivate loyalty among subordinates, including persuading talented individuals like Zhuge Liang to serve him despite his initially weak position, demonstrates exceptional leadership qualities[^119].

Some modern Chinese scholars view Liu Bei as representing an alternative model of leadership that emphasized moral authority and popular support rather than pure military domination, making him relevant to contemporary discussions about political legitimacy and governance[^120]. His image as a leader who cared for common people and maintained ethical standards even in politically expedient situations provides a counterpoint to amoral realpolitik[^121].

### Negative Views

Critical historians have questioned nearly every aspect of Liu Bei's positive reputation, arguing that careful examination of primary sources reveals a figure far more conventional and self-serving than traditional accounts suggest. The Japanese scholar Yoshikawa Eiji and others have argued that Liu Bei's claim to Han imperial descent was likely fabricated or at least greatly exaggerated, suggesting his legitimacy claims were purely propagandistic[^122]. These scholars note the extreme distance between Liu Bei and any confirmed imperial lineage, making his descent claim functionally meaningless even if technically accurate[^123].

Critics emphasize Liu Bei's betrayal of Liu Zhang as revealing his true character beneath the cultivated image of virtue[^124]. They argue that this act of treachery against a benefactor who had welcomed him demonstrates that Liu Bei's moral principles were readily abandoned when political advantage required it[^125]. Some historians suggest this betrayal was particularly egregious because Liu Zhang and Liu Bei shared a surname and clan affiliation, making the betrayal a violation of kinship obligations[^126].

The catastrophic Xiaoting campaign has been cited as evidence of Liu Bei's fundamental unfitness for supreme command[^127]. Critics note that he ignored sound advice from experienced generals, allowed personal emotion to override strategic judgment, and made basic tactical errors that competent commanders would have avoided[^128]. The campaign's disastrous outcome permanently crippled Shu Han's military capability and eliminated any realistic possibility of fulfilling Liu Bei's stated goal of restoring the Han Dynasty, making it an act of spectacular strategic malpractice[^129].

Some scholars argue that Liu Bei's reputation for virtue and benevolence derives almost entirely from literary embellishment rather than historical reality[^130]. They point out that primary historical sources contain limited concrete evidence of exceptional moral behavior, with most stories of Liu Bei's virtue appearing in later, less reliable accounts or in the obviously fictionalized _Romance of the Three Kingdoms_[^131]. These critics suggest that Liu Bei was merely average in moral terms for his era, neither notably better nor worse than other major warlords[^132].

Historians critical of Liu Bei's military abilities note his consistently poor record in independent command before acquiring Yi Province[^133]. They argue that his eventual success owed far more to talented subordinates like Zhuge Liang and his generals than to his own capabilities[^134]. Some suggest that Liu Bei's primary skill was in cultivating a personal image that attracted talented followers, while his actual strategic and tactical judgment was mediocre at best[^135].

The efficiency and stability of Shu Han governance is sometimes attributed entirely to Zhuge Liang rather than Liu Bei, with critics suggesting Liu Bei's main contribution was avoiding interference with his advisor's superior judgment[^136]. They note that Shu Han's most effective administrative and military policies were implemented after Liu Bei's death under Zhuge Liang's regency, suggesting that Liu Bei may have actually constrained his state's potential[^137].

Modern critical scholars have questioned whether Liu Bei's ideology represented genuine conviction or calculated political positioning[^138]. They note that claiming Han legitimacy was an obvious strategic choice for someone with imperial ambitions but limited territorial base, making it impossible to distinguish sincere belief from pragmatic propaganda[^139]. His establishment of an independent imperial regime, rather than serving as a regent for a Han restoration, suggests his rhetoric and actions diverged significantly[^140].

Some historians argue that Liu Bei's legacy has been disproportionately positive due to successful propaganda by the Shu Han regime and later cultural developments, rather than reflecting his actual historical significance[^141]. They note that Shu Han was the weakest and ultimately least successful of the Three Kingdoms, making the cultural prominence of Liu Bei and his state incongruous with their actual historical impact[^142].
