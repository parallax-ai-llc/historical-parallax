## Summary

Suzuki Umetaro was a Japanese chemist who isolated the first vitamin (thiamine/vitamin B1) from rice bran in 1910, publishing his findings as aberic acid (Oryzanin). He published his discovery before Casimir Funk, but his paper was in Japanese and lacked the claim of a new nutrient class, so he did not receive full credit internationally.
