## Summary

Wasaburo Oishi was a Japanese meteorologist who discovered the jet stream in the 1920s by tracking high-altitude weather balloons. His observations at Mount Fuji revealed strong west-to-east winds at high altitudes. His discovery, published in Esperanto, went largely unnoticed outside Japan and was independently rediscovered by American pilots during World War II.
