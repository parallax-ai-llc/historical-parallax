## Summary

Crown Prince Sado (1735-1762) was the second son of King Yeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty and heir apparent to the Korean throne. Despite his considerable talents in martial arts, calligraphy, and painting, he suffered from severe mental illness that manifested in violent outbursts and erratic behavior.[^1] His deteriorating condition and increasingly dangerous actions led his father to order him confined in a rice chest on July 4, 1762, where he died eight days later at age 27.[^2] His tragic death remains one of the most controversial events in Korean royal history, sparking centuries of debate about mental illness, political intrigue, and royal duty.[^3] His son later became King Jeongjo, one of Korea's greatest monarchs, who spent his reign attempting to rehabilitate his father's memory.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Crown Prince Sado was born Yi Seon on February 13, 1735, to King Yeongjo and Royal Noble Consort Yeong of the Jeonui Yi clan.[^5] His birth brought great joy to the Joseon court, as the death of Crown Prince Hyojang nearly seven years earlier had left King Yeongjo without a male heir.[^6] Despite this auspicious beginning, Sado's childhood was marked by emotional distance from his father and unusual pressures that would shape his tragic destiny.

When Sado was only one year old, he was invested as crown prince, an unusually early designation that reflected both his importance as the sole male heir and his father's anxiety about succession.[^7] King Yeongjo, deeply insecure about his own legitimacy due to rumors that his mother had been a mere palace servant, became obsessed with molding his son into a perfect Confucian ruler.[^8] This obsession manifested in an educational regimen of extraordinary rigor and harshness.

Sado commenced formal education at age five in 1740, adhering to Joseon dynasty customs for royal heirs.[^9] His instruction centered on Confucian classics such as the Analects, Mencius, and the Book of Changes, alongside historical texts and moral philosophy. Lessons occurred at the Sejasi-gangwon, a specialized academy established exclusively for the crown prince, featuring up to twenty scholars for intensive daily sessions involving recitation, textual explication, and ethical discourse.[^10] King Yeongjo prioritized elite tutors, commissioning searches for top literati to oversee Sado's studies, reflecting an intent to cultivate a sage-king through unyielding discipline rather than affection.[^11]

However, this intense educational pressure came at a severe emotional cost. King Yeongjo started visiting Sado less and less as he got older, which upset the young prince greatly.[^12] The court ladies who cared for the crown prince were often rude to his mother, Royal Noble Consort Yeong, because they considered her to be of common birth, and King Yeongjo simply avoided the situation by visiting his son even less frequently.[^13] Yeongjo had ordered Sado to be brought up in a palace quite far from the main residence, so Lady Yi did not personally oversee his upbringing in his early years.[^14]

As Sado grew older, he developed a strong interest in martial arts rather than scholarly pursuits, excelling at archery and swordsmanship.[^15] He even authored a martial arts book called Muye Shinbo, and there are records of him displaying amazing skill with the Cheongryongeonwoldo (a type of sword) at age 15.[^16] He was also identified as a talented artist and calligrapher.[^17] Unfortunately, King Yeongjo disapproved of these interests in martial arts, believing scholarly study was more important, and this became yet another source of friction between father and son.[^18]

## Rise to Power

Crown Prince Sado's formal ascent to governmental authority began on March 11, 1749, when he was appointed regent at the age of 14.[^19] This was an atypical arrangement under King Yeongjo's ongoing rule, intended to afford the prince hands-on governance experience and bolster central authority amid factional rivalries that threatened the stability of the Joseon court.[^20] When Sado came of age at 15, his father gave him the power to make decisions on administrative matters, as Yeongjo wanted Sado to have experience of ruling the country.[^21]

In 1744, before his regency began, the nine-year-old Crown Prince Sado had been married to eight-year-old Lady Hong (later known as Lady Hyegyeong) in an elaborate ceremony that lasted seven days.[^22] The wedding took place on January 9, 1744, when both were approximately eight years old.[^23] While the wedding ceremony occurred in 1744, the marriage was consummated in the same month as the 14-year-old Prince Sado's capping ceremony in 1749, which was the traditional coming-of-age ceremony in Korean culture.[^24] This marriage would prove to be the most important source of historical information about Sado's life, as Lady Hyegyeong later wrote detailed memoirs that remain our primary window into the crown prince's troubled existence.

Sado's regency persisted from 1749 until July 4, 1762, shortly before his death, during which he engaged in state deliberations, including participation in the State Council (Uijeongbu), where he advocated policies perceived as reformist.[^25] However, this period of governmental responsibility was marked by constant disappointment and criticism from his father. Lady Hyegyŏng describes King Yeongjo as perpetually dissatisfied with whichever course of action Sado chose.[^26] The king's treatment was harsh—Yeongjo also always made sure to chastise his son in front of a large crowd, publicly humiliating him.[^27]

During Sado's regency, the dispute between the Soron and Noron factions became stronger, much to King Yeongjo's disappointment.[^28] Two rival in-law factions vied for influence over Crown Prince Sado, and the Crown Prince Sado incident became deeply entangled with existing factional politics within the Joseon court.[^29] Additionally, Yeongjo did not permit Sado to visit the ancestral tombs until as late as 1756, nor was he allowed to attend auspicious court events, further marginalizing him despite his official role as regent.[^30]

The constant criticism, public humiliation, and impossible expectations created an atmosphere of severe anxiety for Sado. The tense relationship between Sado and his father King Yeongjo led to him experiencing severe anxiety whenever in his father's presence.[^31] This psychological pressure, combined with other factors, would eventually contribute to the manifestation of serious mental illness.

## Major Achievements

Despite his relatively brief regency and the constraints placed upon him by his father, Crown Prince Sado managed several notable accomplishments that demonstrated both his capabilities and the tragedy of his unrealized potential.

**Martial Arts Contributions**: Crown Prince Sado's most significant documented achievement was his contribution to Korean martial arts. He authored the Muye Shinbo, a martial arts book that became the basis for the later Martial Arts Dobotongji, an important compilation of Korean military techniques.[^32] According to the Annals, Crown Prince Sado was healthy enough to learn martial arts and go outdoors to hunt, and he displayed exceptional skill with various weapons.[^33] His expertise in archery and swordsmanship was widely recognized, and at age 15, he demonstrated amazing skill with the Cheongryongeonwoldo, a type of Korean sword.[^34]

**Artistic Talents**: Sado was identified as both an artist and calligrapher of considerable skill.[^35] Crown Prince Sado had a portrait painted by Byeon Sang-byeok, a famous painter at the time, when he went to Pyongyang, though this painting was not received during his lifetime but by King Jeongjo and Lady Hyegyeonggung Hong ten years after it was painted.[^36] His artistic pursuits represented a more cultured and multifaceted approach to royal education than the purely Confucian scholarship his father demanded.

**Administrative Experience**: During his thirteen-year regency from 1749 to 1762, Sado gained substantial experience in governance, participating in the State Council and engaging with complex administrative matters.[^37] He advocated for policies perceived as reformist, though the specific details of these reforms have been largely lost to history due to King Yeongjo's later suppression of records related to his son.[^38]

**Family Legacy**: Perhaps Sado's greatest achievement was his role as father to Yi San, who would become King Jeongjo, widely regarded as one of the greatest monarchs in Korean history.[^39] Sado was proud of his son's appointment as Grand Heir, and despite his deteriorating mental state, he had violent outbursts directed at his children yet managed to raise a son who would become a transformative ruler.[^40] King Jeongjo's achievements—establishing the Kyujanggak royal library, expanding social mobility, and encouraging Neo-Confucian scholarship during a cultural and political renaissance—can be seen as an indirect legacy of Sado's life.[^41]

**Military Leadership Potential**: Historical records indicate that Sado possessed the physical capabilities and strategic understanding for military leadership. His interest in practical martial skills rather than purely theoretical Confucian scholarship suggested a more pragmatic approach to kingship that might have served Korea well in the turbulent eighteenth century.[^42]

However, all these achievements were overshadowed by the tragedy of his mental illness and the constraints imposed by his relationship with King Yeongjo. His father's disapproval of his martial arts interests and practical skills meant that Sado's genuine talents were never fully appreciated or utilized during his lifetime.[^43] One of the reasons King Yeongjo was disappointed in the crown prince was precisely because he neglected his studies and was good at "miscellaneous science and martial arts," though he was physically strong.[^44]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Crown Prince Sado's life was marked by increasingly disturbing behavior that has generated controversy and debate for over 250 years. The historical record, particularly as documented in Lady Hyegyeong's memoirs, the Hanjungnok, paints a harrowing picture of mental illness manifesting in violent and erratic actions.

**Mental Illness and First Symptoms**: Between the years of 1752-1753, Prince Sado started showing signs of serious mental illness.[^45] In 1752, Sado read a Taoist text called Okchugyeong and while reading, he hallucinated that he saw the Thunder God.[^46] Henceforth, he was terrified of thunder and refused to touch any object engraved with the characters of the book. When his sister Princess Hwahyeop died in 1752, Sado was reported to have grieved intensely, and this loss appears to have been a significant trigger for his deteriorating mental state.[^47]

In 1745, the prince had suffered a severe illness during which he often lost consciousness, and although he recovered, the psychological effects were lasting.[^48] Prince Sado suffered from psychiatric symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, suicidal behavior, aggressive behavior, and persecutory delusion from the age of 13 to 27.[^49] Modern medical analysis suggests he could have been suffering from bipolar disorder, with other studies mentioning obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and anxiety.[^50] A profiler suggested Prince Sado probably had metastatic schizophrenia.[^51]

**Vestiphobia and Obsessive Behaviors**: By 1758, a previous phobia of Sado's regarding clothing (vestiphobia) became intensely problematic.[^52] Sado developed vestiphobia—a fear of clothing—insisting on daily rituals of burning and selecting dozens of outfits under threat of violence.[^53] The prince became obsessed with clothes, and in 1760 his symptoms became worse—he was more violent, his clothing phobia wasn't getting better, and he was hallucinating regularly.[^54]

**Violence and Murder**: The most disturbing aspect of Sado's deteriorating condition was his violence toward palace servants and court members. As a way of dealing with his frustration and rage, Sado beat his eunuchs, and after Queen Jeongseong's burial in 1757, he walked into his chambers holding a severed head of a eunuch he had killed, forcing court members to view it.[^55] This was Sado's first documented murder, and Lady Hyegyeong recorded that he presented the severed head to his horrified wife.[^56]

Historical records indicate he frequently killed palace staff and assaulted and raped ladies-in-waiting.[^57] He would call people with professions, such as doctors, astronomers, and servants, and if he didn't like what they said, he would either injure or kill them.[^58] Reportedly, if anything went slightly wrong Sado would fly into a rage and kill a string of servants, and there are reports that several bodies were removed from his palace every day.[^59] When asked why he was behaving this way, Sado replied that his anger could only be soothed by killing something or someone.[^60]

Aggressive episodes escalated into documented violence, particularly against palace servants, with Sado's reckless killings of attendants alarming officials and prompting repeated interventions.[^61] Over the years following his first murder, he slaughtered countless palace staff and raped women in the court.[^62]

**Threats Against the King**: Late at night, Sado reportedly said he wanted to go to the king's quarters "with a sword" and "end it all"—threatening to kill King Yeongjo.[^63] When a rumor started circulating that Sado had entered the palace with the intention of killing his father, his own mother, Consort Yeong, apparently went to Yeongjo that same day and told him that Sado was out of control and had to be executed.[^64]

**Violence Toward His Own Children**: Sado had particularly violent outbursts—he yelled at his own children, who were all under ten, and kicked them out of his rooms.[^65]

**Historical Suppression**: King Yeongjo enacted a stringent taboo barring any reference to Sado's personal name for the duration of his reign; official chronicles were expurgated, with chroniclers instructed to elide graphic particulars of Sado's violent outbursts—such as the slayings of servants.[^66] King Yeongjo wrote the words to be carved on Sado's tombstone: "Of all the wicked rulers in history, none were like this."[^67]

---

## Personal Life

Crown Prince Sado's personal life was marked by complexity, tragedy, and the devastating impact of mental illness on his relationships with family members.

**Marriage and Wife**: In 1744, when both were approximately eight years old, Sado married Lady Hong (later known as Lady Hyegyeong) in an elaborate seven-day ceremony.[^68] The wedding took place on January 9, 1744, though the marriage was not consummated until 1749, when both reached the age considered appropriate in Korean tradition.[^69] Lady Hyegyeong proved to be a devoted wife who endured extraordinary hardship, including witnessing her husband's descent into madness and the horror of his violent acts, such as when he presented her with the severed head of a eunuch he had murdered.[^70]

Her daughter-in-law recorded that Royal Noble Consort Yeong (Sado's mother) was affectionate toward her children but very strict and taught them "as if she were not their mother," though she tended to her children personally when they fell ill.[^71] Lady Hyegyeong's memoirs, written decades after Sado's death, remain the most comprehensive and intimate account of his life, providing invaluable historical detail about court life and the crown prince's mental deterioration.[^72]

**Children**: Crown Prince Sado had seven children with multiple consorts. With Lady Hyegyeong, he had four children: Yi Jeong, Crown Prince Uiso (first son, 1750-1752, who died at age two), Grand Heir Yi San (second son, later King Jeongjo, 1752-1800), Royal Princess Cheongyeon (first daughter, 1754-1821), and Royal Princess Cheongseon (second daughter, 1756-1802).[^73] With Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Buan Im clan, Sado had Yi In, Prince Euneon (third son, 1754-1801) and Yi Jin, Prince Eunsin (fourth son, 1755-1771).[^74] He also fathered Princess Cheonggeun with Court Lady Park (Royal Noble Consort Gyeong).[^75]

**Relationship with His Mother**: Crown Prince Sado's relationship with his mother, Royal Noble Consort Yeong, was complicated by the circumstances of palace life and his mental illness. She was aware that her son was suffering from a serious mental illness and that he was killing ladies-in-waiting and eunuchs, as Crown Princess Hyegyeong went to her for advice after Sado's first murder in 1757.[^76] Initially Lady Yi wanted to talk to Sado, but her daughter-in-law persuaded her not to, fearing for her safety.[^77] Eventually, Sado's behavior became too out of control for his mother, and when rumors circulated that he intended to kill his father, she went to King Yeongjo and told him that Sado had to be executed.[^78] Royal Consort Yeong even provided a heartbreaking statement: "Since the prince's illness has become quite critical and his case is hopeless, it is only proper you should protect yourself and the royal grandson in order to keep the kingdom at peace. I request you eliminate the prince even though such a suggestion is outrageous and a sin against humanity."[^79]

**Relationship with Siblings**: Sado formed a strong bond with his sister Princess Hwahyeop, who was similarly disfavoured by their father, and when she died in 1752, Sado was reported to have grieved intensely.[^80] This loss appears to have been one of the triggers for his mental deterioration.

**Relationship with Queen Inwon and Queen Jeongseong**: Sado had been close to both Queen Inwon and Queen Jeongseong, and after the deaths of both in 1757, there was a marked deterioration in his mental health and relationship with his father.[^81] These royal consorts apparently provided some emotional support and mediation between Sado and King Yeongjo, and their loss removed crucial stabilizing influences from his life.

**Physical Appearance and Personality**: Historical sources provide limited information about Sado's physical appearance, though we know a portrait was painted by the famous artist Byeon Sang-byeok, though unfortunately the whereabouts of this portrait are unclear today.[^82] Before his illness became severe, Sado was described as physically strong and talented in martial arts.[^83] Despite his troubled life and the horrific acts he committed during his illness, he is generally thought of with pity rather than disgust in Korean historical memory.[^84]

## Legacy

Crown Prince Sado's death in 1762 created ripples that transformed Korean history for generations, primarily through the actions of his son and the ongoing debates about the nature of his life and death.

**King Jeongjo's Rehabilitation Efforts**: Sado's most significant legacy came through his son Yi San, who became King Jeongjo upon succeeding his grandfather in 1776. On the day he was crowned, Jeongjo sat on his throne and declared "I am the son of the Crown Prince Sado," a bold statement since King Yeongjo had banned any mention of the prince's name for the rest of his reign.[^85] This declaration set the tone for Jeongjo's entire reign, as he sought to clear his father's name, balance political factions, and strengthen royal authority.[^86]

Prince Sado was reinstated as crown prince fifteen days after he died, though Yeongjo forbade further mention of him.[^87] King Jeongjo changed his father's posthumous name to a longer one, which is the origin of Sado's alternative title, Crown Prince Jangheon.[^88] The original posthumous title "Sado" given by King Yeongjo meant "thinking of with great sorrow."[^89]

**Memorial Projects**: King Jeongjo undertook several major projects to honor his father's memory. His body was moved by King Jeongjo to its current location in 1789, then called Hyeonnyungwon near Suwon, 30 kilometres south of Seoul.[^90] Five years later, the Hwaseong Fortress was built by King Jeongjo specifically to memorialize and honour his father's tomb, with construction lasting from 1794 to 1796.[^91] Lady Hyegyŏng died and was buried with her husband in 1816.[^92]

**Posthumous Elevation**: Prince Sado and Lady Hyegyŏng were posthumously elevated in status and given the titles Emperor Yangjo and Empress Heonyeong in 1899 during the reign of Emperor Gwangmu (Gojong), and their tomb was upgraded accordingly and renamed Yungneung.[^93] The tomb is now part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty and is located in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province.[^94]

**Political Legacy**: During King Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged as the ruling Noron faction split further between the Byeokpa and Sipa, two groups which differed in their attitudes concerning Yeongjo's execution of his son.[^95] Byeokpa (Dogmatists) clung to orthodoxy and defended Sado's execution, while Sipa (Realists) pushed reform and defended Sado's memory.[^96] The Noron faction had made Crown Prince Sado die while fallen from grace, and later tried to shame and kill King Jeongjo throughout his life and reign.[^97]

**Cultural Impact**: The tragic death of Crown Prince Sado in 1762 has been the subject of much discussion, not only in the academic world but also in South Korean popular culture.[^98] Crown Prince Sado was portrayed by Lee Je-hoon in the 2014 SBS TV series Secret Door and by Yoo Ah-in in the 2015 film The Throne.[^99] These productions present Crown Prince Sado as a tragic hero in South Korean popular culture, and for the public, Sado has become the epitome of a tragic hero who fell victim to the forces of the establishment.[^100]

**Lady Hyegyeong's Memoirs**: Lady Hyegyeong wrote a memoir in 1805 detailing their life together, which remains an important historical source about his life and death.[^101] The Memoirs of Lady Hyegyong, known in Korean as "Han-jung-nok" (literally, "Records Written in Silence"), is a collection of four autobiographical pieces written within the ten-year period 1795 to 1805.[^102] These memoirs, which recount the chilling murder of her husband by his father, form one of the best known and most popular classics of Korean literature.[^103]

**Enduring Memory**: Despite the horrific nature of many of his actions, Sado is generally thought of with pity rather than disgust in Korean historical memory.[^104] Few historians would assign such comprehensive influence to even the longest-serving and most powerful monarchs, and far less to the tragic crown prince, Sado, whose manner of death admittedly cast a long shadow.[^105]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship and popular culture have increasingly portrayed Crown Prince Sado in sympathetic terms, emphasizing the tragic dimensions of his life rather than focusing solely on his violent acts.

**Victim of Mental Illness**: The prevailing scholarly consensus today recognizes that Crown Prince Sado suffered from genuine psychiatric disorders. The opinion that it is credible based on the recent findings as to Prince Sado's symptoms of mental illness described in Lady Hyegyeong's memoirs is gaining weight.[^106] Prince Sado suffered from psychiatric symptoms, including depressed mood, anxiety, suicidal behavior, aggressive behavior, and persecutory delusion from the age of 13 to 27, and modern medical analysis suggests he could have been suffering from bipolar disorder.[^107] This interpretation casts him as a victim of an era that lacked understanding of mental health and appropriate treatment methods.

**Victim of Political Intrigue**: Some historians emphasize the role of factional politics in Sado's downfall. Modern historiography evolved from mid-20th-century acceptance of Sado's madness to 1980s emphases on factional intrigue, positing his death as a Noron-Soron power sacrifice amid Yeongjo's Tangpyeongchaek (impartiality policy).[^108] According to some historical narratives, a faction of the "Old Doctrine" (Noron) Party maneuvered to frame Sado and thus force King Yeongjo to sentence him to death.[^109]

**Victim of Parental Abuse**: Many scholars and popular accounts emphasize the psychological damage inflicted by King Yeongjo's harsh treatment. Lady Hyegyŏng describes King Yeongjo as perpetually dissatisfied with whichever course of action Sado chose, and the king's treatment was harsh—Yeongjo also always made sure to chastise his son in front of a large crowd.[^110] King Yeongjo struggled with insecurities about his mother having been a palace servant and rumors that he poisoned his older half-brother, which made Yeongjo obsessed with perfection, including in his son.[^111] This constant criticism and public humiliation is seen as contributing significantly to Sado's mental deterioration.

**Talented Individual with Unrealized Potential**: Defenders of Sado's memory point to his considerable talents in martial arts, art, and calligraphy as evidence of what he might have achieved under different circumstances.[^112] He authored the Muye Shinbo, a martial arts book that became the basis for important later compilations, and displayed exceptional skill with weapons.[^113]

**Popular Culture Glorification**: In contrast to historical data that suggest Sado was mentally ill and violent, popular culture has presented him in a more sympathetic light as a victim, blaming political power struggles for his alienation from his father King Yeongjo and his eventual death.[^114] The 2014 TV series Secret Door and the 2015 film The Throne portrayed him as a tragic hero, and these depictions have significantly influenced public perception.[^115] For the public, Sado has become the epitome of a tragic hero who fell victim to the forces of the establishment.[^116]

### Negative Views

Despite the sympathetic reinterpretations, substantial historical evidence supports more critical assessments of Crown Prince Sado's actions and their threat to the Joseon court.

**Documented Violence**: According to historians, there is no evidence that Sado was the victim of a conspiracy, and the historical data suggest that Sado was mentally ill and a violent person whose death was necessary to safeguard the position of the Yi royal house.[^117] The primary historical sources, particularly Lady Hyegyeong's memoirs and the Annals of King Yeongjo, provide detailed accounts of his violent actions that cannot be dismissed.[^118]

Historical records document that he frequently killed palace staff and assaulted and raped ladies-in-waiting, with reports that several bodies were removed from his palace every day.[^119] He would call people with professions, such as doctors, astronomers, and servants, and if he didn't like what they said, he would either injure or kill them.[^120] When asked why he was behaving this way, Sado replied that his anger could only be soothed by killing something or someone.[^121]

**Threat to Dynastic Stability**: Scholars debate the extent to which Sado's behaviors justified King Yeongjo's extreme measure of confinement in a rice chest, with some emphasizing his unpredictability as a threat to dynastic stability.[^122] The fact that he reportedly threatened to kill the king—saying late at night that he wanted to go to the king's quarters "with a sword" and "end it all"—represented a direct threat to the monarchy itself.[^123]

**Mental Illness Not an Excuse**: Some historians argue that while Sado's mental illness is well-documented, it does not absolve him of responsibility for murders and sexual assaults. King Yeongjo wrote on Sado's tombstone: "Of all the wicked rulers in history, none were like this," reflecting the severity of his son's actions.[^124]

**Rejection of Conspiracy Theories**: According to historians, there is no evidence that Sado was the victim of a conspiracy, though throughout the 19th century, rumors circled that Sado was never ill and had been framed by his political opponents.[^125] Modern scholars largely reject these conspiracy theories in favor of the mental illness explanation, but this rejection also means accepting the reality of his violent acts.

**Historiographical Debate**: The question of whether his death was retribution for his actual misconduct or if he was the victim of a conspiracy by his political opponents continues to generate scholarly debate.[^126] Crown Prince Sado was either a sadistic madman, the victim of poor mental health care and societal taboos, or the focus of an insidious conspiracy to control the Korean royal family—or perhaps some combination of all three.[^127]
