## Summary

Lee Jae-myung (born December 22, 1964) is the current President of South Korea, having been elected as the 14th President in June 2025 following the impeachment of Yoon Suk-yeol.[^1] A former factory worker who overcame poverty to become a human rights lawyer, Lee rose to national prominence as the "Cider" (refreshingly blunt) Mayor of Seongnam and Governor of Gyeonggi Province, known for his bold welfare policies like universal basic income.[^2] After a narrow defeat in the 2022 election and surviving an assassination attempt in 2024, he led the opposition's resistance against the Yoon administration, playing a pivotal role in the anti-martial law movement that swept him into power.[^3]

## Early Life and Struggles

Lee Jae-myung was born in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province, into extreme poverty. His family moved to Seongnam when he was young, where he worked in factories instead of attending middle and high school.[^4] During this time, he suffered an industrial accident that permanently disabled his left arm, exempting him from military service.[^5]

Despite these hardships, he passed the high school equivalency exam and entered Chung-Ang University on a scholarship. Influenced by the democratization movement, he chose to become a human rights lawyer and labor activist in Seongnam, rather than pursuing a comfortable career as a judge or prosecutor.[^6]

## Political Career

### Mayor of Seongnam
Lee elected Mayor of Seongnam in 2010. He gained fame for his moratorium on the city's debt and his implementation of expanded social welfare programs, including free uniforms for students and youth dividends.[^7] His decisive administrative style and effective use of social media earned him a strong following among younger voters.

### Governor of Gyeonggi Province
In 2018, he was elected Governor of Gyeonggi Province, South Korea's most populous province. There, he gained a reputation for his strict handling of the COVID-19 pandemic (including raiding the headquarters of a cult spreading the virus) and his crackdown on illegal valley businesses.[^8]

### 2022 Presidential Bid and Opposition Leader
Lee ran for president in 2022 but lost to Yoon Suk-yeol by a margin of just 0.73%—the closest presidential race in South Korean history.[^9] Following his defeat, he was elected leader of the Democratic Party. His leadership was marked by intense legal battles, as prosecutors launched multiple investigations into allegations of corruption during his time as mayor (the Daejang-dong scandal). Lee characterized these investigations as political persecution.[^10]

## The Path to Presidency

### Assassination Attempt
In January 2024, Lee survived a near-fatal knife attack during a visit to Busan, sustaining a stab wound to his neck.[^11] The incident rallied his supporters and highlighted the deepening polarization in South Korean politics.

### Martial Law and Impeachment
The turning point came in December 2024, when President Yoon Suk-yeol declared martial law. Lee live-streamed himself climbing the fence of the National Assembly to enter the building and lead the vote to nullify the decree.[^12] His leadership during this constitutional crisis cemented his status as the defender of democracy. Following Yoon's removal in April 2025, Lee won the snap election in June with a decisive mandate.[^13]

## Presidency (2025–Present)

Inaugurated on June 4, 2025, Lee vowed to heal the nation's wounds and implement his vision of a "Basic Society" (guaranteeing basic income, housing, and finance).

### "New Republic" Reforms
His administration immediately launched a sweeping reform of the prosecution service and government agencies to prevent the abuse of power seen in the previous administration.[^14] He also pledged to tackle the demographic crisis with radical state support for childcare and housing.

### Foreign Policy
Lee signaled a shift from Yoon's hardline stance, advocating for a "pragmatic diplomacy" that balances relations between the United States and China while seeking to restart dialogue with North Korea.[^15]

## Controversies

### Daejang-dong Scandal
Allegations that he granted favors to private developers for the Daejang-dong land development project while Mayor of Seongnam have shadowed him for years. While he denies all charges, the legal risks remain a point of contention.[^16]

### Populism Accusations
Critics label his economic policies, such as universal basic income and massive cash handouts, as dangerous populism that could bankrupt the nation and fuel inflation.[^17]

## Legacy

As the current president, Lee's legacy is still being written. However, his journey from a child laborer to the presidency represents a powerful narrative of social mobility in South Korea. He is defined by his resilience and his controversial but transformative policy ideas.[^18]

## Historical Assessment

1.  **Doer and Administrator:** Supporters view him as a "man who gets things done," citing his high administrative approval ratings as governor and mayor. They value his ability to deliver tangible benefits to citizens.[^19]
2.  **Defender of Democracy:** His actions during the 2024 martial law crisis are celebrated as heroic, positioning him as the leader who saved the country from a return to dictatorship.[^20]
3.  **Welfare Visionary:** Proponents argue his "Basic Society" vision offers the only real solution to extreme inequality and the looming AI-driven job crisis.[^21]

### Negative Views

1.  **Legal and Moral Risks:** Opponents argue he is deeply corrupt, pointing to the numerous criminal investigations and the curse of "surrounding deaths" (several people linked to his scandals have died).[^22]
2.  **Divisive Populist:** Conservatives view him as a dangerous demagogue who exploits class warfare and recklessly spends taxpayer money to buy votes.[^23]
