## Summary

Lee Jae-myung (born December 22, 1964) is the 14th President of South Korea, elected in June 2025 following the impeachment of Yoon Suk-yeol.[^1] A self-made man who rose from extreme poverty as a child factory worker to become a human rights lawyer, Lee is known for his fiery populism and "Cider" (refreshingly blunt) political style.[^2] He gained national fame as an effective administrator while Mayor of Seongnam and Governor of Gyeonggi Province, where he implemented bold welfare experiments like Basic Income.[^3] Having survived a near-fatal assassination attempt in 2024, he led the opposition's resistance to Yoon Suk-yeol's martial law declaration, cementing his image as the defender of Korean democracy.[^4]

## Early Life and Struggles

Lee Jae-myung was born on December 22, 1964, in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province. His family was destitute, reportedly "too poor to even possess a secure spoon."[^5] They moved to Seongnam, a satellite city of slums near Seoul, where Lee worked in factories instead of attending middle and high school.

### The Industrial Accident

At age 13, his left arm was permanently crushed in a press machine accident at a factory. The disability (Joint Grade 6) exempted him from military service but left him with a lifelong physical reminder of his working-class roots.[^6] During this time, he suffered from depression and attempted suicide twice, but eventually found solace in study.

Despite his lack of formal schooling, he passed the high school equivalency exams and entered Chung-Ang University on a scholarship. Initially aspiring to be a judge for the stable income, he was radicalized by the democratization movement and the lecture of a visiting lawyer named Roh Moo-hyun. He chose instead to become a human rights lawyer in Seongnam, defending labor unionists and activists.[^7]

## Political Career: "The Doer"

### Mayor of Seongnam (2010–2018)

In 2010, Lee was elected Mayor of Seongnam. He inherited a city on the brink of bankruptcy.

- **Moratorium:** He famously declared a moratorium on the city's debts, froze spending, and cracked down on tax evasion.
- **Welfare Expansion:** With the saved money, he launched signature welfare programs: a "Youth Dividend" (cash payments to 24-year-olds), free school uniforms, and free postnatal care centers.[^8] These policies made him a hero to progressives and a villain to conservatives, who labeled him a populist.

### Governor of Gyeonggi Province (2018–2021)

As Governor of South Korea's most populous province, Lee's reputation for ruthless efficiency grew.

- **Valley Cleanup:** He forcibly removed hundreds of illegal businesses (restaurants and platforms) that had occupied public valleys and streams for decades, returning the nature to the public. He personally confronted business owners, boosting his popularity.[^9]
- **Shincheonji Raid:** During the initial COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, centered around the secretive Shincheonji cult, Lee personally led a team of officials to raid their headquarters to seize their membership list for contact tracing, threatening to break down the doors if they didn't comply.[^10]

### 2022 Presidential Bid

Lee won the Democratic Party nomination but lost the 2022 presidential election to Yoon Suk-yeol by a margin of just **0.73%** (247,000 votes), the closest race in South Korean history.[^11]

---

## The Opposition Leader and Crisis

Following his defeat, Lee faced intense legal persecution. Prosecutors launched nearly 400 raids on his properties and associates related to the **Daejang-dong Development Scandal** (allegations of reducing private developers' profits to fund public projects) and corporate sponsorship allegations.[^12]

### Assassination Attempt

On January 2, 2024, while visiting the construction site of the Gadeokdo New Airport in Busan, Lee was stabbed in the neck by a 67-year-old man posing as a supporter asking for an autograph.[^13] The knife pierced his jugular vein, missing the carotid artery by millimeters. He underwent emergency surgery and survived, returning to the campaign trail weeks later with a visible scar.[^14]

### The Martial Law Hero

The defining moment of his career came on the night of December 3, 2024. When President Yoon declared martial law, Lee live-streamed his desperate journey to the National Assembly. With troops blocking the main gates, the 60-year-old Lee was filmed **climbing over the perimeter fence** to enter the legislative grounds.[^15] Inside, he rallied opposition and ruling party lawmakers alike to unanimously vote to nullify the martial law decree, effectively saving the republic.

---

## Presidency (2025–Present)

With Yoon removed, Lee won the snap election on June 3, 2025, with a comfortable margin.

### Vision: The "Basic Society"

Lee's governing philosophy is the creation of a **"Basic Society,"** where the state guarantees a minimum standard of living for all citizens as a right, not charity.[^16]

- **Basic Income:** His long-term goal is a universal basic income of 500,000 won ($400) per month, funded by a land value tax and carbon tax.
- **Basic Housing:** Supply of high-quality public rental housing in prime locations ("Station-area Basic Homes") to solve the housing crisis.
- **Basic Finance:** A state-guaranteed "Basic Loan" of up to 10 million won ($8,000) for all citizens at low interest rates, preventing the poor from turning to loan sharks.[^17]

### Foreign Policy: Pragmatic Realism

Rejecting Yoon's "values-based diplomacy," Lee advocates for **"Pragmatic Diplomacy."** He seeks to balance relations between the US and China, arguing that South Korea's economy relies on China while its security relies on the US. He has also moved to restart humanitarian aid and dialogue with North Korea to lower tensions.[^18]

## Controversies

### Legal Risks

Lee remains an indicted defendant in multiple ongoing trials. While the presidency grants him immunity from prosecution while in office, the trials (Daejang-dong, election law violations) cast a shadow over his legitimacy. His opponents call him a "criminal suspect president."[^19]

### Populism Concerns

Economists warn that his "Basic Series" policies could bankrupt the state, exacerbate inflation, and discourage work. His proposal to distribute "citizen dividends" is criticized as vote-buying.[^20]

---

## Legacy

As a sitting president, Lee's legacy is active. He represents the first South Korean president to come from the true urban working poor (unlike Moon or Roh, who were rural poor). His rise highlights the demand for radical redistribution in a society plagued by inequality.[^21]

### Historical Assessment

**Positive Views:**

1.  **Administrative Genius:** Supporters point to his track record in Seongnam and Gyeonggi-do as proof that he can "fix" the broken Korean state machine.[^22]
2.  **Defender of Democracy:** His physical courage during the martial law crisis is widely credited with preventing a second military dictatorship.[^23]
3.  **Visionary:** He is seen as the only politician addressing the coming AI job displacement crisis with his Basic Income proposals.[^24]

**Negative Views:**

1.  **Demagogue:** Critics compare him to populist strongmen, arguing he has authoritarian tendencies and demonizes his opponents.[^25]
2.  **Moral Hazards:** The scandals surrounding his wife (corporate card misuse) and his past profanity-laced phone calls haunt his public image.[^26]
