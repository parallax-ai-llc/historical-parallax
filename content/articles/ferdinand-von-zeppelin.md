## Summary

Ferdinand von Zeppelin was a German general and inventor who developed the rigid airship that bears his name. His Zeppelin airships became the first commercially successful aircraft, operating passenger flights across Europe and the Atlantic. The Zeppelin became a symbol of technological progress in the early 20th century, though the Hindenburg disaster in 1937 ended the airship era.
