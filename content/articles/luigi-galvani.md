## Summary

Luigi Galvani discovered 'animal electricity' when he observed that the legs of dead frogs twitched when touched by metal probes. His experiments, published in 1791, launched the study of bioelectricity and inspired Volta's invention of the battery. The term 'galvanism' is named after him, and his work founded electrophysiology.
