## Summary

Yoon Suk-yeol (born December 18, 1960) served as the 13th President of South Korea from 2022 until his impeachment and removal from office in 2025.[^1] A career prosecutor who rose to fame for investigating high-profile corruption scandals involving former presidents, Yoon entered politics as an outsider and won the 2022 election by a razor-thin margin.[^2] His presidency was characterized by a hardline stance on North Korea, a strengthening of the US-South Korea alliance, and a controversial attempt to relocate the presidential office.[^3] However, his term ended abruptly after he declared martial law in December 2024, an unconstitutional move that led to his impeachment by the National Assembly and subsequent removal by the Constitutional Court in April 2025, making him the second president in South Korean history to be removed from office.[^4]

## Early Life and Legal Career

Yoon Suk-yeol was born in Seoul in 1960 to academic parents. He studied law at Seoul National University but struggled with the bar exam, passing it on his ninth attempt in 1991.[^5]

As a prosecutor, Yoon developed a reputation as a fierce, independent investigator who did not bow to political pressure. He gained national prominence in 2013 for investigating the National Intelligence Service's election interference, famously stating, "I am not loyal to people" (implying loyalty only to the organization/law).[^6] In 2016, he led the special investigation team that indicted President Park Geun-hye for the Choi Soon-sil gate scandal, which led to her impeachment.[^7]

Appointed Prosecutor General by President Moon Jae-in in 2019, Yoon later clashed with the Moon administration over the investigation of Justice Minister Cho Kuk, turning him into a hero for the conservative opposition.[^8]

## Presidency (2022–2025)

Yoon narrowly defeated liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung in the 2022 presidential election.[^9]

### Relocation and "Imperial Presidency"
One of his first acts was to fulfill a campaign pledge to move the presidential office out of the Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae) to the Ministry of National Defense compound in Yongsan, aiming to end the "imperial presidential culture." This move was criticized for its high cost and security concerns.[^10]

### Foreign Policy and Defense
Yoon adopted a "peace through strength" approach, resuming large-scale military exercises with the United States and taking a tougher line against North Korea's nuclear provocations.[^11] He also prioritized improving frayed ties with Japan, making controversial concessions on the forced labor issue to solidify trilateral security cooperation with the US and Japan.[^12]

### Domestic Struggles
Domestically, Yoon struggled with low approval ratings throughout his tenure alongside a hostile, opposition-controlled National Assembly.[^13] His administration faced repeated criticism for its lack of communication, the "Scallion Incident" (appearing out of touch with inflation), and ongoing controversies surrounding his wife, First Lady Kim Keon-hee.[^14]

## The December Martial Law Crisis

On the night of December 3, 2024, facing political deadlock and impending impeachment motions against his cabinet members, President Yoon declared **emergency martial law**, accusing the opposition Democratic Party of "anti-state" activities and paralyzing the government.[^15]

The declaration shocked the nation and the world. Troops attempted to enter the National Assembly building, but lawmakers managed to convene and unanimously voted to lift the martial law in the early hours of December 4.[^16] The military withdrew, and the decree was rescinded.

### Impeachment and Removal
The failed martial law declaration was widely condemned as an act of insurrection. The National Assembly voted to impeach Yoon on December 14, 2024.[^17] On April 10, 2025, the Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment, stripping him of his office and presidential immunity, ending his presidency after less than three years.

## Controversies

### "First Lady Risks"
Throughout his term, allegations involving First Lady Kim Keon-hee—ranging from stock manipulation to the acceptance of a luxury Dior bag—plagued his administration. Yoon's repeated use of the presidential veto to block special investigations into his wife fueled public anger.[^18]

### Erosion of Democracy
Critics argued that Yoon used the prosecution service as a political tool to target opponents and the media, leading to a decline in South Korea's democracy indices.[^19] The V-Dem Institute notably downgraded South Korea's democratic status during his term.[^20]

## Legacy

Yoon Suk-yeol's legacy is defined by his catastrophic end. While he sought to realign South Korea's foreign policy and establish the rule of law, his authoritarian turn in declaring martial law cemented his image as a threat to the very democracy he pledged to protect.[^21] He is remembered as a warning against the politicization of the prosecution and the dangers of unchecked executive power.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

1.  **Strengthened Alliance:** Supporters credit him with restoring the South Korea-US alliance and normalizing relations with Japan, which they argue was necessary for national security in the face of North Korean and Chinese threats.[^22]
2.  **Anti-Cartel Drive:** His focus on breaking up what he termed "interest cartels" (e.g., in unions and the construction sector) was seen by some conservatives as a necessary structural reform.[^23]

### Negative Views

1.  **Martial Law Dictator:** The declaration of martial law in 2024 is viewed as the darkest moment in South Korean democracy since the military dictatorships, effectively erasing any other achievements.[^24]
2.  **Incompetence and Stubbornness:** Critics argue his "prosecutor mindset"—seeing the world in black and white—made him unsuited for the nuance of politics, leading to constant conflict and policy paralysis.[^25]
3.  **Veto Politics:** His frequent use of the presidential veto to protect his family and reject opposition bills showed a disregard for the legislative branch and the will of the people.[^26]
