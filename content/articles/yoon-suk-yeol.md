## Summary

Yoon Suk-yeol (born December 18, 1960) served as the 13th President of South Korea from 2022 until his impeachment and removal from office in 2025.[^1] A career prosecutor who rose to fame for investigating high-profile corruption scandals involving former presidents, Yoon entered politics as a conservative outsider and won the 2022 election by the narrowest margin in history (0.73%).[^2] His presidency was characterized by a staunchly pro-American foreign policy, including the historic **Camp David Summit** and a controversial rapprochement with Japan.[^3] However, his tenure ended in catastrophe after he declared **Emergency Martial Law** on December 3, 2024. This unconstitutional act led to his immediate impeachment by the National Assembly and his subsequent removal by the Constitutional Court on April 4, 2025, making him the second president in South Korean history to be removed from office.[^4]

## Early Life and Legal Career

Yoon Suk-yeol was born in Seoul in 1960 to academic parents; his father was a renowned economics professor at Yonsei University.[^5] He studied law at the prestigious Seoul National University. Famous for his stubborn streak, it took him nine attempts to pass the bar exam, finally succeeding in 1991 at the age of 30.[^6]

As a prosecutor, Yoon developed a reputation as a fierce, independent investigator who "did not bow to people." He gained national prominence in 2013 for investigating the National Intelligence Service's election interference, famously stating during a parliamentary hearing, **"I am not loyal to people,"** implying his loyalty was only to the law and the organization.[^7] In 2016, he led the special investigation team that indicted President Park Geun-hye and her confidante Choi Soon-sil, leading to Park's impeachment.[^8]

Appointed Prosecutor General by President Moon Jae-in in 2019, Yoon later clashed violently with the Moon administration over the corruption investigation of Justice Minister Cho Kuk. This conflict transformed him into an icon of the conservative opposition and a presidential contender.[^9]

## Presidency (2022–2025)

Yoon defeated liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung in the 2022 election. His presidency was marked by a dramatic shift in foreign policy and persistent domestic political deadlock.

### Relocation to Yongsan
One of his first acts was to fulfill a campaign pledge to move the presidential office out of the "imperial" Blue House (Cheong Wa Dae) to the Ministry of National Defense compound in Yongsan. This move, intended to improve communication with the public, was criticized for its high cost, security risks, and hastiness.[^10]

### Foreign Policy: The "Global Pivotal State"
Yoon adopted a "peace through strength" approach.
*   **Japan Rapprochement:** In March 2023, he announced a "third-party reimbursement" plan for victims of wartime forced labor, effectively absolving Japanese companies of direct liability. While deeply unpopular domestically, this move thawed frozen relations with Tokyo.[^11]
*   **Camp David Summit:** In August 2023, Yoon joined US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at Camp David for a historic trilateral summit. They established the "Camp David Principles," committing to unprecedented security cooperation and consulting on threats, effectively cementing a trilateral quasi-alliance.[^12]

### Domestic Struggles
Domestically, Yoon faced a hostile, opposition-controlled National Assembly and stubbornly low approval ratings (often below 30%). His administration was plagued by the **"First Lady Risks"** involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee (allegations of stock manipulation and the acceptance of a luxury Christian Dior bag). Yoon's repeated use of the presidential veto to block special investigations into his wife fueled public anger and accusations of hypocrisy.[^13]

## The December Martial Law Crisis

The defining moment of his presidency began on the night of **December 3, 2024**.

### The Declaration
At **10:27 PM**, facing impending impeachment motions against his top auditor and prosecutors, President Yoon appeared on live television and declared **Emergency Martial Law**. He accused the opposition Democratic Party of being "anti-state forces" paralyzed by pro-North Korean sympathies and vowed to "eradicate the shameless pro-North anti-state forces."[^14]

### The Night of Chaos
For the first time since 1980, martial law troops were deployed to the National Assembly. Soldiers smashed windows and attempted to storm the main chamber to arrest lawmakers. However, opposition leader **Lee Jae-myung** and Speaker **Woo Won-shik**, along with other lawmakers, managed to scale fences and enter the building before the military could secure it.[^15]

### The Lift
At **1:00 AM on December 4**, with 190 lawmakers present, the National Assembly unanimously voted to lift the martial law. Under the constitution, the president must comply. At **4:30 AM**, Yoon rescinded the order, ending the six-hour crisis.[^16]

### Impeachment and Removal
The failed coup attempt was widely condemned as an act of insurrection.
*   **Dec 14, 2024:** The National Assembly voted overwhelmingly to impeach Yoon.[^17]
*   **Jan 15, 2025:** Yoon was arrested and detained while awaiting trial.
*   **Apr 4, 2025:** The Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment, stripping him of his office. He is currently standing trial for rebellion.[^18]

## Legacy

Yoon Suk-yeol's legacy is catastrophic. He is the only president in South Korea's democratic history to attempt a self-coup (autogolpe) via martial law.[^19] While his foreign policy realigned South Korea with the West, his domestic authoritarianism erased those achievements. He serves as a grim warning about the fragility of democracy and the dangers of unchecked executive power.

### Historical Assessment

**Positive Views (Pre-Martial Law):**
1.  **Strategic Clarity:** Supporters argued he correctly identified the threats from North Korea and China, and prioritized the alliance with the US and Japan, which was essential for long-term security.[^20]
2.  **Labor Reform:** His crackdown on militant labor unions and "construction site cartels" was initially welcomed by the business community as necessary for economic competitiveness.[^21]

**Negative Views:**
1.  **Destroyer of Democracy:** The martial law declaration is viewed as an unforgivable treason that traumatized the nation and nearly destroyed the constitutional order.[^22]
2.  **Prosecutorial Republic:** Critics argue he ran the country like a prosecutor's office, seeing politics as a criminal investigation—enemies to be jailed rather than opponents to be negotiated with.[^23]
3.  **Incompetence:** From the "Scallion Incident" (showing ignorance of grocery prices) to the panicked martial law declaration, his administration is often characterized by sheer political incompetence.[^24]
