## Summary

Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni (973-1048 CE) was a Khwarazmian-Persian polymath during the Islamic Golden Age who made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, astronomy, geography, anthropology, and comparative religion.[^1][^2] Born in Khwarezm (modern-day Uzbekistan), he became one of the most original and productive scholars the Islamic world had ever known, authoring 146 works averaging 90 folios each.[^3] His masterwork on India, *Tarikh al-Hind*, established him as the founder of Indology and comparative religious studies, while his astronomical and mathematical innovations influenced European science for centuries.[^4][^5] George Sarton, founder of the History of Science discipline, designated the 11th century as "the Al-Biruni Age" in recognition of his unparalleled scholarly achievements.[^6]

## Early Life and Background

Abu Rayhan Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Biruni was born on September 4, 973 CE in an outlying district of Kath, the capital of the Afrighid kingdom of Khwarazm, a region adjoining the Aral Sea in what is now Karakalpakstan, Uzbekistan.[^7][^8] His name derives from the Persian word *bērūn* or *bīrūn* meaning "outskirts," reflecting his birthplace on the periphery of the city.[^9] Little is known about al-Biruni's early life, and he himself claimed in a poem preserved in a medieval biographical dictionary that he did not know his own father, much less his family origins.[^10][^11] He came from what he described as an "average" family of Tajik origin, not part of any affluent or well-known lineage.[^12]

Despite these humble beginnings, al-Biruni received an exceptional education under the tutelage of Abu Nasr Mansur ibn Iraq, a member of the ruling Khwarezm-Shah dynasty and possibly his patron.[^13][^14] This educational relationship proved formative, developing into a long-standing intellectual collaboration in which teacher and student would ask each other to undertake specific research projects to support their respective work.[^15] The young al-Biruni demonstrated extraordinary precocity; by the age of seventeen, he was already engaged in serious scientific work, computing the latitude of Kath in 990 CE by observing the maximum altitude of the sun.[^16]

Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm, where he studied an astonishingly broad curriculum including Islamic jurisprudence, theology, grammar, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.[^17] A gifted linguist, he became conversant in his native Khwarezmian, as well as Persian, Arabic, and later Sanskrit, and also possessed knowledge of Greek, Hebrew, and Syriac.[^18][^19] This linguistic facility would prove essential to his later groundbreaking work in cross-cultural scholarship and translation.

One character trait consistent throughout his education and adult life was what contemporaries described as "an indefatigable seeker of knowledge with no love for sensuous pursuits."[^20] This dedication to learning appears to have defined his entire existence, with no evidence of marriage or children found in historical records.[^21] Al-Biruni's complete absorption in his studies shaped not only his scholarly achievements but also his personal philosophy, which he would later articulate in his famous statement preferring "to be criticized in Arabic rather than be praised in Persian," reflecting his intellectual rigor and preference for constructive criticism over empty compliments.[^22]

## Rise to Prominence

Al-Biruni's path to scholarly prominence unfolded against a backdrop of extraordinary political turbulence in the eastern Islamic world. He served more than six different princes throughout his career, all known for their bellicose activities, with many meeting violent ends.[^23][^24] This instability, while dangerous, exposed al-Biruni to diverse intellectual centers and patronage networks that facilitated his research.

His early career in Khwarezm was interrupted by political upheaval around 995 CE, forcing him to flee to Rayy (near modern Tehran), where he found refuge at the court of the Buyid prince Fakhr al-Dawla.[^25] This period in Rayy, however, was "peppered with academic disputes and criticism of his work and theories," suggesting that al-Biruni's uncompromising intellectual standards sometimes created friction with other scholars.[^26] During this time, he engaged in notable correspondences with other leading intellectuals, including a rather confrontational written debate with the famous physician-philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) about the nature of heat and light, and criticizing the Peripatetic school's adherence to Aristotelian physics.[^27][^28]

After Fakhr al-Dawla's death in 997 CE, al-Biruni returned to Khwarezm, where he enjoyed a productive period under the patronage of the Ma'munid dynasty. However, this stability ended abruptly in 1017 CE when the powerful Ghaznavid sultan Mahmud of Ghazni conquered Khwarezm.[^29] Most scholars, including al-Biruni, were taken to Ghazni (in modern Afghanistan), where he was appointed court astrologer.[^30] While this forced relocation might have seemed a setback, it became the catalyst for al-Biruni's most significant scholarly achievement.

Accompanying Mahmud on his military invasions into the Indian subcontinent beginning in 1017, al-Biruni, then forty-four years old, seized the opportunity to conduct an unprecedented systematic study of Indian civilization.[^31][^32] Unlike many of his contemporaries who viewed non-Muslim cultures with suspicion or disdain, al-Biruni approached India with genuine scientific curiosity and methodological rigor. Over the course of thirteen years, he made extensive travels throughout India, visiting regions including Sindh (where he met several major Isma'ili scholars in the city of Multan) and parts of Punjab, including Lahore.[^33][^34]

During these travels, al-Biruni undertook the extraordinary effort of learning Sanskrit, a feat almost unheard of for a Muslim scholar of his era.[^35] Over time, he won the welcome of Hindu scholars and collected books, studying intensively to become fluent enough in Sanskrit to translate works between Arabic and Sanskrit in both directions.[^36][^37] This linguistic and cultural immersion was not mere academic exercise but reflected al-Biruni's revolutionary methodological approach: to understand a culture "both analytically, in a manner that could be verified or rejected based on available evidence, and on its own terms."[^38]

His scholarly objectivity and impartial treatment of the customs and creeds of various nations earned him the honorific title *al-Ustadh* ("The Master"), and his work gained recognition throughout the Islamic world.[^39] By the time al-Biruni settled permanently in Ghazni, he had established himself as the preeminent polymath of his age, with his reputation extending from Central Asia to the Middle East and beyond.

## Major Achievements

Al-Biruni's scholarly production was staggering in both quantity and quality. He authored a total of 146 books, each averaging approximately 90 folios, with nearly half devoted to astronomy, mathematics, and related subjects like mathematical geography.[^40][^41] His achievements across multiple disciplines established new methodologies and advanced human knowledge in ways that would influence scholarship for centuries.

### Astronomy and Physics

In astronomy, al-Biruni's contributions were revolutionary. His magnum opus *Al-Qanun al-Mas'udi* (The Mas'udi Canon) stands as a comprehensive astronomical encyclopedia containing detailed calculations of planetary motions, eclipses, and the Earth's circumference.[^42] Through refined observational techniques, he discovered that the apogee of the sun has its own motion, distinct from the motion of precession—a significant finding that challenged prevailing models.[^43] He developed new algebraic techniques for solving third-degree equations and drew subtle distinctions between different types of celestial motion, exploring numerous applied mathematical techniques to achieve unprecedented precision in tabulated astronomical results.[^44]

One of his most remarkable achievements was his measurement of Earth's radius. Al-Biruni was the first scholar to obtain a simple formula for measuring Earth's radius, developing a new method based on sine trigonometric functions.[^45][^46] Using this innovative technique, he calculated Earth's radius to be 6,339.9 kilometers—an astonishing 99.5% accuracy compared to modern measurements.[^47] This work established him as the founder of geodesy, the science of measuring Earth's size and shape.[^48]

Al-Biruni also demonstrated insights into the nature of light that were centuries ahead of his time. He wrote that light's velocity "must be immense when compared to the speed of sound," a remarkable deduction made purely through observation and reasoning.[^49] His work on astronomy and mathematical techniques, along with that of his contemporary Ibn Yunus, laid foundations that would later influence European astronomers such as Copernicus during the Renaissance.[^50]

### Mathematics and Geography

Al-Biruni's mathematical contributions extended beyond astronomy into pure and applied mathematics. He advanced trigonometry significantly, developing sophisticated trigonometric tables and pioneering applications of spherical trigonometry in astronomical calculations.[^51] His masterpiece in mathematical geography, *Tahrid nihayat al-amakin* (Determination of the Coordinates of Places), defended the essential role of mathematical sciences in geography and provided comprehensive instruction on determining longitudes and latitudes on land.[^52]

### Indology and Comparative Religion

Perhaps al-Biruni's most enduring legacy lies in his groundbreaking work on India. His monumental treatise *Kitab al-Hind* (Tarikh al-Hind, or "The History of India") remains, in the eyes of many scholars, the most important work on Indian history and culture produced by anyone before the twentieth century.[^53][^54] This work was not merely descriptive but analytical, delving into the social, political, and religious sources of Indian advances in mathematics, astronomy, and other sciences.[^55]

To produce this work, al-Biruni translated twenty-seven classical works from Sanskrit into Arabic, having learned Sanskrit himself—a feat of extraordinary dedication.[^56] He also translated works from Arabic into Sanskrit, demonstrating genuine bidirectional cultural exchange.[^57] His comparative studies of religions, especially Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam, were marked by unusual objectivity and fairness, rare in medieval scholarship.[^58] This earned him the titles "Father of Comparative Religion," "Founder of Indology," and recognition as the first anthropologist.[^59][^60]

### Methodology and Scientific Approach

Al-Biruni's methodology was as important as his specific findings. He defended the pursuit of knowledge itself, stating that knowledge is "the virtue that distinguishes mankind from all the animals" and is "pursued for the sake of knowledge itself."[^61] He emphasized that "the good cannot be brought forth, and evil cannot be avoided, except by knowledge."[^62] His approach to research emphasized going "beyond what is necessary" in each matter, believing that through such diligent exercise one "will be lifted from the physical to the divine teachings."[^63]

His total contribution to science, mathematics, astronomy, geography, anthropology, and cross-cultural understanding established him as what many consider the most original polymath the Islamic world had ever known.[^64]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his towering reputation, al-Biruni's work and methods generated significant controversy during his lifetime and have been subject to critical assessment by later scholars.

### Religious Controversies and Sectarian Tensions

Al-Biruni's relationship with Islamic orthodoxy was complex and occasionally contentious. He rejected hadiths (sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad) that contradicted scientific evidence or reason, including the fasting hadith on Ashura reported in the canonical collection *Sahih al-Bukhari*, basing his rejection on historical and scientific reasoning.[^65] According to Islamic scholar Yasir Qadhi, al-Biruni was "not pro-Hadith" and was "sceptical of the Hadith," an unusual position for a Muslim scholar of his era.[^66]

Intriguingly, al-Biruni did not identify explicitly as either Sunni or Shia, describing himself only as "a Muslim."[^67] Some scholars have suggested that it is possible al-Biruni "feigned sectarian indifference to disarm criticism of the impassioned pro-Shiʿite writings of his youth," implying a strategic ambiguity about his religious allegiances.[^68] While he displayed remarkable fairness and open-mindedness toward non-Muslim faiths such as Hinduism and Zoroastrianism, avoiding both syncretism and religious relativism, "the open-mindedness he displayed in treating non-Muslim religions was less apparent when he turned to Muslim 'heresies.'"[^69]

### Academic Conflicts

Al-Biruni was not shy about directing harsh criticism toward those he deemed intellectually dishonest or incompetent. He directed his "most sarcastic diatribes at astrologers such as Abū Maʿšar Balḵī, who reconstructed history to fit their theories of astral influences," demonstrating his contempt for what he considered pseudoscience.[^70] He was also "sharply critical of religious and specifically Brahmin attempts to oppose new knowledge, and scathing towards Brahmagupta for conceding to the religious explanation of solar eclipses," showing that his critical eye extended to scholars of all backgrounds when he felt they subordinated evidence to dogma.[^71]

### Methodological Limitations

While al-Biruni's work on India is celebrated for its objectivity, it was not without limitations. His writing style was "very poetic, which may diminish some historical value for modern times," and his general disinterest in military and political affairs meant that "the lack of description of battle and politics makes those parts of the picture completely lost."[^72] This selective focus, while reflecting his scholarly interests, created gaps in the historical record he produced.

Modern scholars have also noted specific errors in al-Biruni's work. He "erroneously attributed a curious version of the story of Jacob and Esau to 'the Torah,'" suggesting that even his extensive learning had limits when it came to sources he could not directly access or verify.[^73]

### Questions of Reliability

The question "Can we trust Al-Biruni's historical accounts of India?" has been raised by modern scholars, reflecting ongoing debates about the reliability of his observations and the extent to which his own cultural biases may have colored his interpretations, despite his efforts at objectivity.[^74] While al-Biruni demonstrated "intelligent skepticism" toward historical sources, collecting multiple traditions, subjecting them to impartial assessment, and rejecting those contrary to reason or nature, his methods were still constrained by the limitations of his era.[^75]

### Personal Abrasiveness

Al-Biruni's personality could be abrasive. He expressed "total disgust with flattery, even when it was being directed at him," suggesting a personality that valued intellectual honesty over social niceties to an extent that may have created difficulties in his relationships with patrons and fellow scholars.[^76] His confrontational correspondence with Avicenna and the academic disputes that marked his time in Rayy indicate that his uncompromising standards sometimes generated conflict.[^77]

---

## Personal Life

Al-Biruni's personal life remains largely shrouded in mystery, with remarkably little known about his private affairs despite his voluminous writings and historical prominence. By his own admission in a poem preserved in a medieval biographical dictionary, al-Biruni claimed "that he did not know his own father, much less his family origins," an extraordinary confession that suggests either illegitimate birth or profound early disruption of his family life.[^78]

### Family and Relationships

No evidence of marriage or children has been found in historical records, an absence that appears consistent with al-Biruni's self-described character as "an indefatigable seeker of knowledge with no love for sensuous pursuits."[^79] This characterization, recorded by contemporaries, explains what might otherwise seem a surprising absence of family life for a man who lived seventy-five years. Al-Biruni appears to have been completely devoted to his intellectual pursuits to the exclusion of personal relationships beyond those serving scholarly purposes.

His most significant personal relationship appears to have been with his teacher and patron Abu Nasr Mansur ibn Iraq, with whom he maintained a long-standing intellectual collaboration characterized by mutual respect and shared research interests.[^80] Beyond this mentorship, al-Biruni's relationships with other scholars seem to have been primarily through correspondence and occasional direct interaction, as with Avicenna, with whom he "corresponded in a rather confrontational fashion, about the nature of heat and light."[^81]

### Personality and Character

Al-Biruni's personality emerges from historical sources as one of remarkable intellectual integrity combined with personal austerity. His famous statement that he preferred "to be criticized in Arabic rather than be praised in Persian" reveals a man who valued substantive intellectual engagement over nationalist sentiment or empty flattery.[^82] He expressed this sentiment "in the context of demonstrating his total disgust with flattery, even when it was being directed at him," suggesting profound humility combined with intellectual confidence.[^83]

This disdain for false praise and preference for honest criticism, even when harsh, appears to have been a defining characteristic. Al-Biruni was, as historical sources describe, "an admirably impartial writer on the customs and creeds of various nations," with his scholarly objectivity earning him the honorific *al-Ustadh* ("The Master") in recognition of his balanced treatment of subjects, particularly in his description of India.[^84]

### Intellectual Relationships

While emotionally reserved in personal matters, al-Biruni maintained active intellectual relationships through extensive correspondence with scholars throughout the Islamic world. His exchanges with Avicenna, while contentious, demonstrate genuine engagement with peer intellectuals.[^85] During his travels in India, he managed to "win the welcome of Hindu scholars," suggesting an ability to build cross-cultural intellectual relationships when scholarly interests were at stake.[^86]

### Daily Life and Habits

Details about al-Biruni's daily habits, living arrangements, or personal preferences are virtually nonexistent in historical records. What emerges instead is a portrait of a man whose entire existence seems to have been organized around the acquisition and production of knowledge, with personal comforts and conventional social relationships subordinated entirely to intellectual pursuits.

## Legacy

Al-Biruni's intellectual contributions have left an indelible mark on the history of science, establishing him as one of the most significant scholars of the medieval period and ensuring his influence extended far beyond his own lifetime and cultural context.

### Scientific and Academic Recognition

George Sarton, the founder of the History of Science discipline, designated the eleventh century as "the Al-Biruni Age" in recognition of his unparalleled scholarly achievements—an honor shared by few individuals in the history of science.[^87] This recognition reflects al-Biruni's unique position as someone who was "not only able to acquire world fame as an astronomer, a mathematician, a physicist, but what is more, he was also known as someone who was well acquainted with culture, art and social sciences."[^88]

Al-Biruni's multiple honorific titles—"Father of Comparative Religion," "Father of modern geodesy," "Founder of Indology," and recognition as the first anthropologist—testify to his pioneering work across multiple disciplines.[^89][^90] Each of these titles represents not merely competence but the establishment of entirely new fields of systematic inquiry or methodological approaches that subsequent scholars would build upon.

### Influence on European Science

The transmission of al-Biruni's work to Europe had profound consequences for the development of Western science. European scholars rediscovered his writings during the Renaissance, "sparking a renewed interest in the sciences and paving the way for the Scientific Revolution."[^91] The work of al-Biruni and his contemporary Ibn Yunus in astronomy "laid the foundation for later European astronomers such as Copernicus," whose heliocentric model drew upon observational techniques and mathematical methods developed by Islamic astronomers.[^92]

Al-Biruni's emphasis on empirical observation, mathematical precision, and the testing of hypotheses against evidence established methodological standards that would become central to modern scientific practice. His insistence on "intelligent skepticism" toward received wisdom and his demand for verification of claims through observation and calculation anticipated the scientific method that would emerge centuries later.[^93]

### Cross-Cultural Scholarship

Perhaps al-Biruni's most enduring legacy lies in his pioneering approach to cross-cultural study. His work on India, *Kitab al-Hind*, established a model for "comparative studies of religions, especially Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, and Islam," marked by "unusual objectivity and fairness, which was rare in medieval scholarship."[^94] His "massive and sophisticated study" delved into "the social, political, and even religious sources of Indian advances in mathematics, astronomy, and other sciences," creating a template for serious cross-cultural academic inquiry.[^95]

This comparative and analytical approach, seeking to understand other cultures "both analytically, in a manner that could be verified or rejected based on available evidence, and on its own terms," represented a revolutionary methodology that anticipated modern anthropological and sociological approaches by centuries.[^96]

### Modern Commemorations

Al-Biruni's legacy continues to be honored in modern times through various commemorations. In 1970, the International Astronomical Union officially named a lunar crater "Al-Biruni," located on the Moon's far side, symbolizing his astronomical legacy among global scientists.[^97] UNESCO established a prize named after al-Biruni "to evoke his 11th-century emphasis on evidence-based inquiry, intercultural dialogue, and science for humanity," reflecting recognition that his values and methods remain relevant to contemporary challenges.[^98]

Biruni University in Turkey bears his name, as do numerous scientific institutions, schools, and research centers throughout Central Asia, the Middle East, and beyond, ensuring that new generations of scholars encounter his name and legacy.[^99]

### Lasting Impact on Islamic Scholarship

Within the Islamic world, al-Biruni is celebrated as one of the brightest luminaries of the Islamic Golden Age, a period when Muslim scholars led the world in scientific, mathematical, and philosophical inquiry.[^100] His example of rigorous empirical investigation combined with profound theoretical understanding established standards for Islamic scholarship that influenced generations of subsequent Muslim scientists and philosophers. His insistence that knowledge should be "pursued for the sake of knowledge itself" and his defense of reason and evidence over uncritical acceptance of authority resonated throughout Islamic intellectual history.[^101]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessment of al-Biruni has been overwhelmingly positive, with historians of science consistently ranking him among the greatest polymaths of the medieval period. His comparative religious studies have earned particular praise for their methodological sophistication and ethical stance. Historians note that he "displayed remarkable fairness and open-mindedness toward other faiths without syncretism or religious relativism, being as unequivocal in rejecting beliefs unacceptable to Muslims as in condemning unfair criticism of other faiths."[^102]

Al-Biruni's methodological rigor has been especially celebrated. His demonstration of "intelligent skepticism toward historical sources, collecting multiple traditions, subjecting them to impartial assessments of plausibility, rejecting those contrary to reason or nature, and comparing the remainder for the most believable solution" established him as a pioneer of critical historical methodology.[^103] This approach, combined with his willingness to privilege empirical evidence over received wisdom, has led many scholars to view him as a proto-scientist whose methods anticipated the scientific revolution by several centuries.

His contributions to astronomy and mathematics have been recognized as foundational. The precision of his measurement of Earth's radius—achieving 99.5% accuracy with eleventh-century instruments—stands as a testament to both his observational skill and mathematical sophistication.[^104] His development of new techniques in trigonometry and his innovations in geodesy established him as "the founder of the science of geodesy," a field that remains essential to modern geography and cartography.[^105]

Defenders of al-Biruni emphasize his extraordinary linguistic abilities and cultural sensitivity. His willingness to spend years learning Sanskrit to understand Indian civilization on its own terms, rather than relying on translated or secondhand accounts, demonstrated a commitment to authentic understanding that was virtually unprecedented in his era.[^106] This effort resulted in what many scholars consider "the most important treatise on Indian history and culture produced by anyone before the twentieth century," a work that remains valuable to historians and Indologists today.[^107]

His role in cross-cultural transmission of knowledge has been particularly emphasized in recent scholarship. The translation movement he participated in, "initiated by Islamic scholars like Al-Biruni, played a pivotal role in the transmission of knowledge between" Islamic and Indian civilizations, "contributing to a rich exchange of ideas, languages, and cultural practices" that enriched both traditions.[^108]

### Negative Views

Despite widespread admiration, al-Biruni's work has also faced criticism from various perspectives. Some critics have questioned the reliability of his historical accounts, particularly regarding India. The question "Can we trust Al-Biruni's historical accounts of India?" reflects ongoing scholarly debate about the extent to which his cultural background and the limitations of his access may have introduced inaccuracies or biases into his descriptions.[^109]

His writing style has been criticized as potentially compromising historical accuracy. Critics note that "Biruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some historical value for modern times," suggesting that his literary artistry sometimes came at the expense of precision.[^110] Additionally, his lack of interest in military and political affairs meant that "the lack of description of battle and politics makes those parts of the picture completely lost," creating significant gaps in the historical record he produced.[^111]

Al-Biruni's religious views have attracted criticism from various quarters. His skepticism toward hadith and his rejection of traditions that contradicted scientific evidence put him at odds with more traditionally-minded Muslim scholars, both in his own time and subsequently.[^112] His refusal to identify explicitly with either Sunni or Shia Islam, while possibly reflecting genuine independence of thought, also opened him to suspicion from adherents of both major branches of Islam.[^113]

Some scholars have noted that while al-Biruni demonstrated remarkable open-mindedness toward non-Muslim religions, particularly Hinduism, "the open-mindedness he displayed in treating non-Muslim religions was less apparent when he turned to Muslim 'heresies,'" suggesting a double standard in his treatment of Islamic sectarian differences versus entirely different religious traditions.[^114]

Critics have also pointed to specific factual errors in al-Biruni's work, such as his erroneous attribution of "a curious version of the story of Jacob and Esau to 'the Torah,'" as evidence that even his extensive learning had limits and that his works should not be treated as infallible authorities.[^115]

His personality has also drawn criticism. His confrontational correspondence with Avicenna and the "academic disputes and criticism of his work and theories" that characterized his time in Rayy suggest someone whose intellectual arrogance could create conflicts.[^116] His "total disgust with flattery" and preference for harsh criticism over praise, while intellectually admirable, may have made him difficult to work with and alienated potential supporters.[^117]

Finally, some modern scholars have suggested that al-Biruni's methodology, while advanced for his era, still reflected limitations inherent to medieval scholarship. His reliance on observation without systematic experimentation, his acceptance of certain Aristotelian physical principles that would later be disproven, and his inability to fully transcend the intellectual frameworks of his time limit his status as a truly "modern" scientist, despite his many innovations.

## Famous Quotes

> "Once a sage asked why scholars always flock to the doors of the rich, whilst the rich are not inclined to call at the doors of scholars. 'The scholars,' he answered, 'are well aware of the use of money, but the rich are ignorant of the nobility of science.'"[^118]

This quote illustrates al-Biruni's understanding of the relationship between wealth and knowledge, and the different values placed on material versus intellectual riches.

> "I prefer to be criticized in Arabic rather than be praised in Persian."[^119]

This statement reflects al-Biruni's intellectual rigor and preference for substantive criticism over nationalist flattery, demonstrating his commitment to honest scholarly engagement.

> "For it is the same whether you take it that the Earth is in motion or the Sky. For, in both the cases, it does not affect the Astronomical Science. It is just for the Physicist to see if it is possible to refute it."[^120]

Here al-Biruni demonstrates remarkable scientific objectivity, suggesting a proto-relativistic understanding of reference frames centuries before the development of modern physics.

> "The good cannot be brought forth, and evil cannot be avoided, except by knowledge."[^121]

This quote encapsulates al-Biruni's philosophy regarding the supreme importance of knowledge as the foundation for ethical action and human progress.

> "Knowledge is the virtue that distinguishes mankind from all the animals and is pursued for the sake of knowledge itself."[^122]

Al-Biruni here articulates his view that the pursuit of knowledge is inherently valuable, not merely instrumentally useful, distinguishing pure intellectual inquiry from practical application.
