## Summary

Feng Yuxiang (1882-1948) was a Chinese warlord and general known as the "Christian General" who dominated parts of North China during the turbulent warlord era (1918-1930). Converting to Christianity in 1914, he distinguished himself by governing with a mixture of paternalistic Christian socialism and military discipline, banning opium, gambling, and prostitution in territories under his control.[^1] He played pivotal roles in major events including the 1924 Beijing Coup that expelled the last emperor from the Forbidden City, the Northern Expedition (1926-1928), and resistance against Japanese aggression in 1933.[^2] Despite serving as Vice Premier of China from 1928 to 1930, Feng was notorious for betraying nearly every ally he made, earning nicknames like the "Tricky Warlord."[^3] He died mysteriously in a shipboard fire on the Black Sea in 1948 while returning to participate in Communist China's formation, and was posthumously honored by Mao Zedong as a "good warlord."[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Feng Yuxiang was born on November 6, 1882, in Baoding, Hebei Province, to a family originating from Chaoxian County (now Chaohu) in Anhui Province.[^5] His father, Feng Yumao, served as a low-ranking officer in the Qing Dynasty's imperial army, specifically a platoon commander of the local forces that comprised the Huai Army under General Liu Mingchuan.[^6] Feng Yumao had seven sons, of which Feng Yuxiang was the second, though only the first two children survived to adulthood.[^7]

Yuxiang grew up in conditions of material hardship typical of junior military households. Adding to the family's difficulties, both parents were opium addicts, which exacerbated the family's severe financial struggles.[^8] The young Feng received minimal formal education—attending school for approximately 15 months before poverty forced him to contribute to the family income.[^9] When he was ten years old, his name was entered on the rolls of a battalion of the Huai Army so that he could earn money to help support the family, and he became a soldier at the age of 11.[^10]

Despite his limited formal schooling, Feng was largely self-educated and sought every opportunity to further his basic education.[^11] At age 14, he formally enlisted in the army, following his father into military service.[^12] He complemented the lectures he received in the army with meetings with educated officers as well as self-imposed readings on classics and other works.[^13] By 1902, he had joined the modernized New Army, positioning himself within the reforms that were transforming China's military structure.[^14]

His early experiences of poverty, his parents' opium addiction, and the harsh realities of military life would profoundly shape his later commitment to social reform, particularly his fierce opposition to opium use, gambling, and other vices that he believed corrupted Chinese society.[^15] These formative years in the lower ranks of the military also gave him an unusual understanding of and connection with ordinary soldiers, which would later distinguish his leadership style from that of other warlords.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Feng's ascent through the military hierarchy was rapid by the standards of the late Qing period. By 1910, he had achieved the rank of battalion commander, demonstrating both military competence and political acumen.[^17] During the Xinhai Revolution of 1911, Feng joined the Luanzhou Uprising against the Qing Court and supported the revolutionaries in the South, declaring independence from the Manchu court.[^18] However, the uprising was suppressed by the Beiyang Army, and Feng was imprisoned by Yuan Shikai, who commanded the powerful Beiyang forces.[^19]

Feng's imprisonment proved temporary. He reconciled with Yuan Shikai's regime and continued his military career within the Beiyang Army structure.[^20] In 1914, he experienced a profound personal transformation when he converted to Christianity with the help and advice of Chinese diplomat Wang Zhengting, being baptized into the Methodist Episcopal Church.[^21] By 1914, encounters combined with exposure to YMCA activities and urban church services in Beijing prompted his Christian commitment.[^22] Accounts describe a pivotal illness around 1910-1914, during which a missionary's prayers coincided with his rapid recovery, which Feng attributed to divine intervention.[^23]

This conversion earned him the enduring nickname "the Christian General" and became central to his public identity.[^24] He practiced Christianity devoutly throughout his life, attempting to spread his religious faith to the men in his command, combining modern military training with worship, Bible lessons, and the singing of hymns.[^25] He urged his soldiers to become Protestants, to engage in social reform, to acquire practical education, and to become physically fit and morally sound.[^26]

Feng's military prowess helped him defeat conservative forces attempting to restore the Manchu dynasty in 1917.[^27] By the early 1920s, he had built a substantial power base commanding significant forces within the Zhili clique, one of the major factions in the warlord-dominated Republic of China.[^28] His position within the Zhili clique placed him at the center of power struggles that would define China's political landscape throughout the 1920s.[^29]

## Major Achievements

### The 1924 Beijing Coup and Expulsion of Puyi

Feng's most dramatic political action came during the Second Zhili-Fengtian War in October 1924, when he orchestrated the Beijing Coup, betraying his Zhili clique superiors, including Wu Peifu and President Cao Kun.[^30] Early on October 23, 1924, Feng's Beijing defense troops seized control of key government buildings, public utilities, and the roads leading into and out of Beijing.[^31] This coup knocked the Zhili clique out of power and repositioned the balance of forces in North China.[^32]

Following the coup, Feng implemented significant reforms. On November 5, 1924, he made a revolutionary cultural move by expelling Puyi, the Qing dynasty's last emperor, from the Forbidden City.[^33] Feng unilaterally revised the "Articles of Favourable Treatment" that had been signed between the Qing imperial house and the Republic of China government, abolishing Puyi's imperial title and privileges and reducing him to a private citizen.[^34] Puyi was given only three hours to leave the palace where he had resided since his 1912 abdication.[^35]

This act was profoundly symbolic, marking a definitive end to imperial China and paving the way for the Palace Museum to be established in the Forbidden City on October 10, 1925.[^36] The expulsion demonstrated Feng's willingness to challenge traditional power structures and his commitment to republican ideals, though critics would note it also demonstrated his capacity for dramatic betrayals.[^37]

### Formation of the Guominjun (People's Army)

Following the Beijing Coup, Feng reorganized his soldiers into the Guominjun ("People's Army"), also known as the Northwest Army.[^38] The Guominjun was a military faction founded by Feng Yuxiang, Hu Jingyi, and Sun Yue during China's Warlord Era, and gained control of much of Northwest China, including Shaanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan.[^39] By March 1926, the Guominjun had grown substantially, though it faced challenges from rival warlord factions.[^40]

### Soviet Alliance and Military Modernization

In 1925, Feng cultivated a relationship with the Soviet Union to strengthen his military position. Soviet military advisers arrived at Feng's Guominjun headquarters in Kalgan in April 1925, supervised by the military attaché in Beijing, with the initial group consisting of twenty-nine military instructors, two political advisers, one physician, and four translators.[^41] The first head of the Kalgan group was Soviet general Vitovt Putna, who was replaced in May 1925 by Vitaly Primakov, one of the founders of the Red Army in Ukraine.[^42]

In May 1926, following military setbacks in North China, Feng traveled to the USSR for several months to observe Russia's progress and study Soviet military and political organization.[^43] When Feng returned from the Soviet Union in September 1926, he had been exposed to Marxism-Leninism, though he maintained his Christian faith alongside his newfound appreciation for socialist organizational methods.[^44] However, Soviet advisers ultimately failed to establish close relations with Feng and his senior officers, and Feng suspected that political indoctrination would corrupt his troops.[^45]

### Role in the Northern Expedition (1926-1928)

Feng threw his support behind the Nationalists in the Northern Expedition and merged his Guominjun with the National Revolutionary Army, becoming a crucial ally of the Kuomintang's campaign to reunify China.[^46] The Guominjun, under Feng's command, reorganized as the Second Army Group, comprising approximately 400,000 troops that advanced into key northern provinces like Henan.[^47] The combined Nationalist and Guominjun forces captured Xuzhou on December 16, 1926.[^48]

In the drive on Beijing, the Northern Expedition forces were joined by Feng's National People's Army, and in early June 1928, they successfully captured the capital, marking the nominal reunification of China under Nationalist leadership.[^49] After the Northern Expedition concluded, Feng's Guominjun continued to control Shaanxi, Henan, and parts of Shandong and Zhili, making him one of the most powerful regional commanders in the new Nationalist order.[^50]

### Service as Vice Premier (1928-1930)

In recognition of his contributions to the Northern Expedition, Feng was appointed Vice President of the Executive Yuan and War Minister of the Republic of China by President Chiang Kai-shek in October 1928.[^51] He served as Vice Premier from October 1928 to October 1930, representing the peak of his integration into the formal Nationalist government structure.[^52]

### Anti-Japanese Resistance (1933)

On May 26, 1933, Feng Yuxiang became commander-in-chief of the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army Alliance, with Fang Zhenwu as vice-commander-in-chief and Ji Hongchang as front-line commander.[^53] The army was estimated to consist of between 60,000 and 120,000 men, composed mostly of former Northwestern Army units under Feng, troops from Fang Zhenwu's Resisting Japan and Saving China Army, remnants of provincial forces from Rehe, counter-Japanese volunteers from Manchuria, and local forces from Chahar and Suiyuan.[^54]

Ji Hongchang's forces successfully recaptured Dolonnur on July 12, 1933, effectively driving the Japanese and Manchukuoan armies out of Chahar Province.[^55] In late July, Feng and Ji Hongchang established the "Committee For Recovering the Four Provinces of the Northeast" at Kalgan, directly challenging Japan's hold on the recently established puppet state of Manchukuo.[^56] However, Chiang Kai-shek believed that communists dominated the Anti-Japanese Allied Army and felt it threatened his authority, imposing a blockade that left the army short of food, clothing, ammunition, and money.[^57] Feng resigned his post on August 18, 1933, and left Chahar; Dolonnur was recaptured by the Japanese immediately afterwards.[^58]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Pattern of Betrayals and Opportunism

Peter R. Moody wrote of Feng: "Many of Feng's allies might dispute this, since he betrayed every one of them."[^59] This characterization as a serial betrayer is well-documented throughout his career. The 1924 Beijing Coup itself was an act of betrayal against his Zhili clique superiors, including Wu Peifu and President Cao Kun, whom he detained after seizing Beijing.[^60] Chiang Kai-shek complained that "the so-called Christian General was a master in the art of deception."[^61]

Feng's leadership was marked by frequent shifts in alliances, often prioritizing short-term gains over long-term loyalty, which critics attribute to a pattern of opportunism that undermined strategic stability.[^62] He earned multiple unflattering nicknames from enemies and former allies: "the Lying General" was a pejorative bestowed by enemies who succumbed to Feng's crafty tactics, and he was described as the "Tricky Warlord"—it was said he could even double-cross himself.[^63]

### The Central Plains War (1930)

By early 1929, Feng grew dissatisfied with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government in Nanjing.[^64] He joined Yan Xishan and Li Zongren to form an anti-Chiang coalition to openly challenge the legitimacy of the Nanjing government.[^65] The Central Plains War of 1930 was the largest conflict in the Warlord Era, fought across Henan, Shandong, Anhui, and other areas of the Central Plains, involving 300,000 soldiers from Nanjing and 700,000 soldiers from the coalition.[^66]

The war almost bankrupted Chiang's Nationalist Government and cost over 300,000 total combined casualties.[^67] Despite the coalition's numerical advantage, Feng and his allies were ultimately defeated when Zhang Xueliang declared his support for Chiang on September 18, 1930, and led his Northeast Army southward through the Shanhai Pass.[^68] On November 4, 1930, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang announced their retirement, marking the complete collapse of the anti-Chiang coalition.[^69]

### Religious Persecution and the Shaolin Temple Incident

In 1927, Feng began a massive campaign to persecute Buddhists in Henan province, resulting in over 400 temples destroyed and many monks killed.[^70] Due to a lack of money to buy weapons and equipment, Feng set his sights on the Daxiangguo Temple in Kaifeng, expelling monks from abandoned temples throughout Henan and transforming the Daxiangguo Temple into a market.[^71] He launched a campaign to destroy Buddhism throughout the province, with all temple properties confiscated and monasteries converted into schools, hospices, libraries, or entertainment venues.[^72]

The most notorious incident occurred in 1928 when Feng's subordinate Shi Yousan set fire to the Shaolin Monastery.[^73] Shi Yousan's troops burned the temple for over 40 days, destroying 90 percent of the buildings, including many irreplaceable manuscripts in the temple library.[^74] While Shi Yousan executed the attack, it occurred within the broader context of Feng's anti-Buddhist campaign and under his general authority as Shi's superior officer.[^75]

### Participation in the White Terror (1927)

In early July 1927, Feng allied with Chiang Kai-shek to implement the White Terror in Shaanxi, a campaign of violent suppression against suspected communists and leftists.[^76] By September 1927, they had killed 496 people, including students, representing Feng's participation in the broader Nationalist purge of communist elements from the revolutionary movement.[^77]

## Personal Life

### Family Background and Early Marriage

Feng's father, Feng Yumao, was a platoon commander in the Huai Army who had seven sons, of whom only Feng Yuxiang and his older brother survived to adulthood.[^78] Both of Feng's parents were opium addicts, which made the family's financial struggles even worse and profoundly influenced Feng's later campaigns against opium use.[^79]

In 1923, Feng's first wife, Liu Dezhen, died, leaving behind two sons and three daughters, all of whom were in their infancy and needed care.[^80] This loss occurred during a critical period in Feng's military and political career, adding personal grief to his professional responsibilities.[^81]

### Marriage to Li Dequan

While training in Beijing, Feng went to the YMCA of Beijing to worship regularly and met Li Dequan, who was then director-general of the YMCA of Beijing.[^82] They had profound conversations and married in 1924, when Feng was 42 years old and Li was 28.[^83] Li was an educated "New Woman" representing the progressive, educated generation of Chinese women emerging in the Republican period.[^84] Together, they had one boy and three girls.[^85]

Feng and Li interwove the private intimacies of love, marriage, and family life into their public and political lives in an unusual manner for the era.[^86] In the Republic, they shared elements of their private lives with journalists, posing for photographs with their children on their way to school and inviting reporters to family events.[^87] During their time in the United States in the late 1940s, Feng and Li, along with their children, established residence in California.[^88]

### Character and Personal Habits

Feng distinguished himself from other warlords through his Christian faith and commitment to personal discipline and social reform.[^89] He forbade prostitution, gambling, and the sale of opium and morphia in territories under his control.[^90] It was said that at one time, there were almost no smokers in his army, and the rate of contracting venereal disease in his province was the lowest in the country.[^91]

He urged his men to become Protestants, to engage in social reform, to acquire a practical education, and to become physically fit and morally sound.[^92] His conversion emphasized evangelical Protestantism, focusing on personal moral regeneration, social welfare, and ethical discipline as antidotes to the corruption and indiscipline he observed in Chinese society and the military.[^93] By converting his soldiers to Christianity, he believed they would be less likely to defect as well as to refrain from vices that could erode military discipline.[^94]

## Legacy

### Communist China's Assessment

Chinese Communists, under Mao Zedong, classified Feng as a "good warlord," and his remains were buried with honors in 1953 at the sacred Mount Tai in Shandong.[^95] This honorable burial at one of China's most sacred mountains demonstrates the high regard the Communist government held for him posthumously, distinguishing him from most other warlords who were condemned by the new regime.[^96]

The Communist Party of China's positive view of Feng stemmed from several factors: his patriotism and opposition to Japanese aggression, particularly his formation and leadership of the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army in 1933;[^97] his opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's civil war policies and his cooperation with the Communist Party after 1945;[^98] and his decision in 1948 to return to China to participate in the preparatory work for the Political Consultative Conference in response to the call of the Communist Party.[^99]

### Family Recognition in the People's Republic

Feng's widow, Li Dequan, was appointed the first Minister of Health of the People's Republic of China, serving from 1949 to 1965.[^100] This appointment of his widow to a ministerial position further demonstrated the CPC's respect for Feng's legacy and represented one of the highest positions held by a woman in the early People's Republic.[^101]

### Enduring Symbol of Patriotic Resistance

Feng's legacy centers on his role as a patriotic resister of Japanese aggression and a reformer who attempted to introduce modern military discipline and social reforms to the territories he controlled.[^102] His anti-Japanese activities in 1933, though ultimately unsuccessful due to Chiang Kai-shek's opposition, established him as one of the few major military figures willing to actively resist Japanese expansion before the full-scale invasion of 1937.[^103]

The nickname "Christian General" remains permanently associated with Feng, representing both his sincere religious faith and his unique approach to governance that combined Christian ethics with military and political power.[^104] His bans on opium, gambling, and prostitution, while paternalistic and enforced through military authority, represented genuine attempts at social reform during an era when most warlords simply exploited the territories they controlled.[^105]

### Controversial Historical Figure

However, Feng's legacy is complicated by his reputation for betrayal and opportunism.[^106] His frequent shifts of allegiance, culminating in major betrayals like the 1924 Beijing Coup and the 1930 rebellion against Chiang Kai-shek, made him a symbol of the unreliability and self-interest that characterized much of the warlord era.[^107] His anti-Buddhist persecution, particularly the destruction of the Shaolin Temple, remains a dark stain on his record that contradicts his image as a reformer guided by Christian ethics.[^108]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters have emphasized several aspects of Feng's career that merit positive recognition. His conversion to Christianity and attempts to govern according to Christian social principles represented a genuine effort to introduce ethical governance and social reform during a period of widespread corruption and exploitation.[^109] Unlike many warlords who profited from opium trafficking, prostitution, and gambling, Feng actively suppressed these vices in territories under his control, improving public health and moral standards.[^110]

His role in expelling Puyi from the Forbidden City is celebrated by republican and communist historians alike as a decisive break with the imperial past and a symbolic affirmation of China's republican future.[^111] The establishment of the Palace Museum shortly thereafter made the treasures of the Forbidden City accessible to the public for the first time in Chinese history.[^112]

Feng's anti-Japanese resistance in 1933, though short-lived, demonstrated patriotic commitment at a time when the Nationalist government was pursuing appeasement policies toward Japan.[^113] The Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army successfully expelled Japanese forces from Chahar Province, representing one of the few military victories against Japanese aggression before the full-scale war began in 1937.[^114]

His opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's authoritarian rule and his support for the Communist Party in his final years positioned him as someone who recognized the Nationalist government's failures and sought alternatives, which explains his favorable treatment by the Communist regime.[^115] His criticism of Chiang's corruption while in the United States, including testimony before the U.S. House Appropriations Committee that resulted in reduced American aid to the Nationalist government, is viewed by Communist historians as courageous truth-telling that exposed the Kuomintang's failures.[^116]

Academic studies have also noted Feng's unusual relationship with his second wife, Li Dequan, as representing a more progressive, companionate marriage model that incorporated elements of the "New Woman" movement and shared public political engagement.[^117] Their integration of private family life with public political roles was relatively innovative for the warlord era.[^118]

### Negative Views

Critics and scholars have emphasized Feng's pattern of betrayals as his defining characteristic, arguing that his opportunism and unreliability exacerbated the chaos of the warlord period and cost hundreds of thousands of lives in unnecessary conflicts.[^119] Peter R. Moody's observation that Feng "betrayed every one of them" regarding his allies summarizes a widespread scholarly assessment that Feng's word could never be trusted.[^120]

Chiang Kai-shek's characterization of Feng as "a master in the art of deception" reflects the view of many contemporaries who worked with Feng and felt betrayed by his shifting allegiances.[^121] The nicknames "the Lying General" and "the Tricky Warlord" were not merely propaganda but reflected genuine experiences of political and military leaders who allied with Feng only to be abandoned or actively betrayed when circumstances changed.[^122]

The Central Plains War of 1930, which Feng helped initiate against Chiang Kai-shek, resulted in over 300,000 casualties and nearly bankrupted the Nationalist government, severely weakening China at a time when Japanese aggression was increasing.[^123] Critics argue that this conflict, driven by Feng's personal ambitions and grievances against Chiang, damaged China's ability to resist Japanese expansion and contributed to the disasters of the 1930s.[^124]

Feng's persecution of Buddhism, culminating in the destruction of over 400 temples and the burning of the Shaolin Temple, reveals the dark side of his religious zeal and willingness to use violence against religious communities that did not conform to his Christian vision.[^125] This religious persecution contradicts the image of Feng as a reformer guided by ethical principles and suggests that his Christianity could be as intolerant and destructive as it was reformist.[^126]

Some scholars question the sincerity of Feng's Christianity, suggesting that his conversion was at least partially motivated by practical considerations: converted Christian soldiers would be less likely to defect and would refrain from vices like opium use that eroded military discipline.[^127] The brutal methods Feng used to enforce Christian morality—including executions and severe punishments—seem inconsistent with Christian teachings about mercy and compassion.[^128]

His participation in the White Terror in Shaanxi in 1927, which resulted in the killing of 496 people including students, demonstrates Feng's willingness to engage in mass political violence when it served his interests, contradicting his image as a progressive reformer.[^129] This episode reveals continuity between Feng and other warlords in the use of terror and mass killing to maintain political control.[^130]
