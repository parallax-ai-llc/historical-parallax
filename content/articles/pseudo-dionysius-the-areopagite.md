## Summary

Pseudo-Dionysius was an anonymous Syrian Christian theologian who wrote under the pseudonym of Dionysius the Areopagite, a convert of the Apostle Paul. His works, including The Celestial Hierarchy, The Divine Names, and Mystical Theology, profoundly influenced both Eastern and Western Christian mysticism. He developed the concepts of apophatic (negative) theology and the via negativa — approaching God by saying what God is not. His writings shaped medieval theology from Thomas Aquinas to Meister Eckhart.
