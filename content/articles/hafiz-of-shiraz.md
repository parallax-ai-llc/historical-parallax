## Summary

Hafiz of Shiraz was a Persian poet whose collected works (Divan-i-Hafiz) are considered the pinnacle of Persian ghazal (lyric) poetry. His poems blend romantic imagery with deep Sufi symbolism, celebrating wine, love, and divine beauty. He is the most beloved poet in Iran, where his Divan is found in almost every home. Goethe was so inspired by Hafiz that he wrote his own West-Eastern Divan in homage.
