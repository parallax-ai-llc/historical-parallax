## Summary

Wilbur Wright, together with his brother Orville, achieved the first powered, sustained, and controlled heavier-than-air flight on December 17, 1903, at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Their systematic approach to solving flight — including wind tunnel testing, wing warping, and three-axis control — was a triumph of engineering methodology.
