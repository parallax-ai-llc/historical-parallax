## Summary

Injo (born December 7, 1595; died June 17, 1649) was the 16th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1623 to 1649.[^1] He came to power through the **Injo Restoration** (a coup against King Gwanghaegun) but his reign is widely regarded as one of the most disastrous in Korean history. His pro-Ming, anti-Manchu diplomacy provoked two devastating invasions by the Qing Dynasty (**Jeongmyo Horan** and **Byeongja Horan**). The capture of Seoul and his surrender at Samjeondo, known as the **Humiliation of Samjeondo**, where he kowtowed to the Qing Emperor, remains a national scar. He is also suspected of involvement in the mysterious death of his own son, **Crown Prince Sohyeon**.[^2]

## The Coup King (Injo Banjeong)

In 1623, the Westerner faction (Seoin) launched a coup to overthrow King Gwanghaegun, citing his "immoral" neutrality between Ming and Qing and his purging of family members.
*   **Accession:** Prince Neungyang (Injo) took the throne, promising to restore Confucian morality and loyalty to the Ming Dynasty. This policy would prove fatal.[^3]

## The Manchu Invasions

### First Invasion (Jeongmyo Horan, 1627)
The Later Jin (future Qing) invaded to punish Injo's hostility. The Joseon army collapsed, and Injo fled to Ganghwa Island. A peace treaty was signed, establishing a "brotherly" relationship.[^4]

### Second Invasion (Byeongja Horan, 1636)
When the Manchus declared the Qing Empire and demanded a "sovereign-subject" relationship, Injo refused. The Qing Emperor **Hong Taiji** personally led 120,000 troops.
*   **Siege of Namhansanseong:** Injo was trapped in the **Namhansanseong Fortress** for 47 days in the freezing winter, starving and surrounded.[^5]
*   **Three Kneelings and Nine Prostrations:** On January 30, 1637, Injo walked out of the fortress to Samjeondo. He performed the humiliating kowtow (banging his forehead on the ground) before the Qing Emperor, surrendering the nation.[^6]

## The Family Tragedy

As part of the surrender, Injo's sons, **Crown Prince Sohyeon** and **Grand Prince Bongrim** (Hyojong), were taken to China as hostages.
*   **Death of Sohyeon (1645):** When Sohyeon returned 8 years later, he urged reform and openness to Western science. Injo, paranoid and hateful of the Qing, viewed his son as a threat. Sohyeon was found dead shortly after, bleeding from all orifices and turning black (signs of poisoning).
*   **Purge:** Injo refused to investigate the death, executed Sohyeon's wife (Crown Princess Minhoe), and exiled his grandsons, effectively wiping out Sohyeon's line.[^7]
