## Summary

Sir John Alexander Macdonald was Canada's first Prime Minister, serving from 1867 to 1873 and again from 1878 until his death in 1891. A dominant figure in Canadian Confederation, he played the central role in uniting British North American colonies into a single nation. His legacy includes building the transcontinental railway, expanding Canada from coast to coast, and establishing federal institutions, but is profoundly complicated by his destructive policies toward Indigenous peoples, including the residential school system and deliberate starvation tactics.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

John Alexander Macdonald was born on January 11, 1815, in Glasgow, Scotland, to Hugh Macdonald and Helen Shaw. In 1820, when John was just five years old, his family emigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada (present-day Ontario), seeking better economic opportunities. The family's early years in Canada were marked by tragedy and financial struggle. Shortly after their arrival, John's younger brother James died from a blow to the head inflicted by a servant charged with caring for the boys—a traumatic event that deeply affected the young Macdonald.[^3][^4]

Hugh Macdonald's business ventures repeatedly failed. After his store in Kingston collapsed, the family moved to Hay Bay, south of Napanee, where Hugh unsuccessfully operated another shop. In 1829, his father secured an appointment as a magistrate for the Midland District, providing some stability to the family's precarious circumstances. These early experiences of economic insecurity and family hardship would shape Macdonald's character and instill in him a fierce determination to succeed.[^5]

Macdonald initially attended local schools in Kingston. When he was ten years old, his family gathered enough money to send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston, where he received a solid classical education. However, his formal schooling ended at age 15—a common school-leaving age at the time when only children from the most prosperous families could afford university education. Despite this limitation, Macdonald demonstrated exceptional intelligence and ambition.[^6]

At 15, he began articling with George Mackenzie, a prominent Kingston lawyer. Macdonald proved to be an exceptionally talented legal apprentice, quickly mastering the intricacies of law. By age 19, he had established his own legal practice—a remarkable achievement for someone so young. He was called to the bar in 1836, beginning a legal career that would provide the foundation for his eventual political success. His work involved several high-profile cases that brought him considerable prominence in Kingston's legal and social circles.[^7][^8]

## Rise to Power

Macdonald's entry into politics came in 1844 when Kingston elected him to the legislature of the Province of Canada as a Conservative representative. As a successful lawyer involved in several high-profile cases, he had already established himself as a prominent figure in Kingston society. His legal acumen, combined with natural political instincts and remarkable interpersonal skills, positioned him well for a political career.[^9]

In the politically unstable environment of pre-Confederation Canada, Macdonald quickly distinguished himself as a master tactician and coalition builder. He played a noteworthy role in forming the 1854 Liberal-Conservative political alliance—a precursor to the modern Conservative Party—setting a pattern of compromise and coalition-building that would characterize his entire career. A leading political commentator of the day described Macdonald's unique skill: he could "herd cats." Macdonald himself often used the term "catching loose fish," by which he meant bringing to his side members with no commitment to any particular party.[^10][^11]

By 1857, Macdonald had become premier of the Province of Canada under the colony's unstable political system, which was plagued by deadlock between French and English, Catholic and Protestant factions. His ability to navigate these divisions and forge working alliances demonstrated political skills that would prove essential to creating Canada as a nation. He insisted that the party officially remain a coalition of moderate Reformers and Conservatives, always keeping Reform members in his cabinet to broaden his party's image and appeal.[^12]

The political breakthrough came with the Great Coalition of 1864, wherein the leaders of three clearly defined parties—George Brown of the Clear Grits, George-Étienne Cartier of the Parti Bleu, and Macdonald of the Liberal-Conservatives—agreed to break free from their entrenched political battles to run the Province of Canada together. This unprecedented cooperation was formed specifically to pursue Confederation. Macdonald successfully negotiated the coalition agreement with Brown, pledging his government to seek a federation of all British North American provinces or, if unsuccessful, a federation of Upper and Lower Canada alone.[^13][^14]

Macdonald was the dominant figure at the Charlottetown, Quebec, and London conferences leading to Confederation in 1867, serving as the principal architect of the Quebec Resolutions that formed the constitutional basis for the new nation. According to Thomas D'Arcy McGee, Macdonald was personally responsible for 50 of the 72 resolutions at the Quebec conference. His political philosophy favored a strong central government—in contrast to the American federal model—believing this would prevent the internal conflicts that had led to the American Civil War.[^15][^16]

## Major Achievements

### Confederation and Nation-Building

Macdonald's greatest achievement was his central role in creating the Dominion of Canada. On July 1, 1867, the British North America Act came into effect, uniting the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick into a single nation. Lord Monck appointed Macdonald as the new nation's first Prime Minister—a position he would hold for nearly 19 years, a length of service surpassed only by William Lyon Mackenzie King.[^17][^18]

In recognition of his services to the British Empire, Macdonald was created Knight Commander of the Bath (KCB) in 1867, becoming "Sir John A. Macdonald." Queen Victoria knighted him for the role he played in creating Confederation, acknowledging his contribution to maintaining British influence in North America.[^19]

### Territorial Expansion

Under Macdonald's leadership, Canada rapidly expanded from its original four provinces to stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Arctic oceans. In 1870, the government purchased Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company, ensuring that the vast northwest would not fall into American hands. This territory was divided into the small Province of Manitoba and the vast North-West Territories.[^20]

British Columbia joined Confederation in 1871 after Macdonald promised to build a transcontinental railroad linking the province to the rest of Canada, with work to start within two years and be completed within ten years. Prince Edward Island joined in 1873, rounding out the initial phase of national expansion. These additions transformed Canada from a modest collection of eastern colonies into a continental nation with enormous potential.[^21][^22]

### The Canadian Pacific Railway

The transcontinental railway had been important to Macdonald since the American Civil War and Fenian raids, when the quick movement of troops across British North America was seen as essential to colonial security. After Confederation, the railway served two critical functions: first, as a firewall against American expansion, and second, as an agent of economic modernization that would unite the scattered provinces into a genuine nation.[^23]

The completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885 fulfilled Macdonald's promise to British Columbia and represented an unparalleled engineering triumph. The railway opened the western prairies for mass settlement by European immigrants and provided the physical infrastructure that made Canada's survival as an independent nation possible. Without this vital link, the western territories might well have been absorbed by the United States.[^24]

### The National Policy

Macdonald returned to power in the 1878 election thanks to his National Policy, an integrated program of economic nationalism that included high protective tariffs to encourage Canadian manufacturing, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway, rapid agricultural development of the West using the railway, and immigration policies designed to attract settlers to Canada. This comprehensive vision of nation-building addressed economic, political, and demographic challenges simultaneously, establishing patterns that would shape Canadian development for generations.[^25][^26]

### Creation of the North-West Mounted Police

On May 23, 1873, Macdonald's government passed the Mounted Police Act, creating a mounted police force in the North-West Territories. Drawing on examples of colonial paramilitary forces throughout the British Empire, such as the Royal Irish Constabulary, Macdonald created the North-West Mounted Police (predecessor to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police) to extend Canadian control over Indigenous territories in Western Canada and clear the way for settlement. In the wake of the Cypress Hills Massacre in June 1873, Macdonald tasked the newly-formed NWMP with marching west to contain Indigenous resistance and guard against possible American annexation.[^27][^28]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Pacific Scandal

On April 2, 1873, Liberal Member of Parliament Lucius Seth Huntington created an uproar in the House of Commons, announcing he had uncovered evidence that Montreal shipping magnate Sir Hugh Allan and his associates had been granted the Canadian Pacific Railway contract in return for political donations of over $350,000 to Macdonald's Conservative campaign in the 1872 election. The evidence included a damning telegram from Macdonald stating "I must have another ten thousand. Will be the last time of calling. Do not fail me."[^29][^30]

The scandal forced Macdonald to resign as Prime Minister on November 5, 1873, in the greatest political humiliation of his career. The affair led to a transfer of power to Alexander Mackenzie's Liberal government. However, despite this disgrace, Macdonald led his Conservatives back to power just five years later in 1878, serving as Prime Minister for another 13 years until his death.[^31]

### Residential Schools and Cultural Genocide

In the early 1880s, when Macdonald was Prime Minister, residential schools for Indigenous children were established across Canada under the authority of the Indian Act, with the explicit goal of stripping Indigenous children of their cultures and languages and forcing them to assimilate into Euro-Canadian society. In 1883, Macdonald reported to the House of Commons that when a child lives on a reserve with parents "who are savages," the child "is simply a savage who can read and write." He argued that "Indian children should be withdrawn as much as possible from the parental influence" through central training industrial schools where they would "acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men."[^32][^33]

It is estimated that 150,000 Indigenous children were coerced into attending these schools from the 1870s until the last one closed in 1996. The residential school system, which Macdonald initiated, resulted in widespread abuse, cultural destruction, and thousands of deaths. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (2008-2015) exposed Macdonald's central role in this system through a detailed report released in December 2015, fundamentally reshaping public understanding of his legacy.[^34][^35]

### Starvation Policy in the North-West

Macdonald implemented policies that deliberately used starvation as a tool of control over Indigenous peoples in the North-West. In 1882, he told the House of Commons: "I have reason to believe that the agents as a whole … are doing all they can, by refusing food until the Indians are on the verge of starvation, to reduce the expense." Macdonald implemented the recommendation to close Fort Walsh in southwestern Saskatchewan to assert control over First Nations and Métis people. Thousands who depended on food rations at the fort faced starvation, resulting in many deaths.[^36][^37]

After the creation of Manitoba in 1870, Prime Minister Macdonald actively vetoed the plans of Lieutenant Governor Archibald to distribute land to the Métis, hoping that delaying the distribution would allow white settlers to outnumber the Métis and force them to leave. This deliberate undermining of the promises made in the Manitoba Act contributed to ongoing grievances that would culminate in the North-West Resistance of 1885.[^38]

### Execution of Louis Riel

In 1885, the North-West Mounted Police joined Canada's military forces in suppressing the North-West Resistance led by Louis Riel and involving various Métis, Cree, Assiniboine, and Saulteaux communities. Macdonald's purpose, in his own words, was to "convince the Red Man that the White Man governs." After the resistance was crushed, Riel was tried for treason, convicted, and sentenced to death. Despite appeals for clemency from Quebec and humanitarian pleas, Macdonald refused to commute the sentence. The execution of Louis Riel took place in 1885 in Regina at the NWMP barracks, creating a political crisis that divided the country along French-English lines for generations.[^39][^40]

### Racist Immigration Policies

Macdonald's views on race profoundly influenced Canadian immigration and voting policies. In 1885, while pushing through the Electoral Franchise Act, Macdonald introduced an amendment taking the vote away from men of "the Mongolian or Chinese race," which he later called one of his "greatest achievements." In parliamentary debates, Macdonald declared that allowing Chinese people to settle permanently in Canada would mean "the Aryan character of the future of British America would be destroyed." These explicitly racist policies established legal discrimination that would persist in Canadian law for decades.[^41][^42][^43]

The Electoral Franchise Act of 1885 also restricted voting rights to men over 21 who were British subjects and met property qualifications. It prevented all women, most Indigenous people west of Ontario, and those of "Mongolian or Chinese race" from voting. While the act initially included some Indigenous voting rights, after the North-West Resistance it was amended to exclude Indian peoples in Manitoba, British Columbia, Keewatin, and the North-West Territories, as well as most Indigenous people living on reserves elsewhere in Canada.[^44][^45]

## Personal Life

### First Marriage: Isabella Clark

In 1842, during a two-month trip to Britain, Macdonald met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. They married in 1843, beginning what would be a profoundly difficult marriage. Within two years, Isabella became chronically ill, suffering from mysterious bouts of weakness and pain. A modern medical examination of her symptoms concluded she suffered from a somatization disorder, perhaps with a migrainous component, secondary opiate-dependence, and pulmonary tuberculosis.[^46][^47]

The couple had two sons. John Alexander died when he was only 13 months old—a devastating loss that deeply affected both parents. Their second son, Hugh John, was largely raised by Macdonald's sister Margaret and her husband James Williamson, as Isabella's illness made parenting nearly impossible. Hugh John would later become Premier of Manitoba, continuing his father's political legacy. Isabella died in 1857 after years of suffering, leaving Macdonald a widower with a young son.[^48][^49]

### Second Marriage: Agnes Bernard

In December 1866, Macdonald began courting Agnes Bernard, the sister of his private secretary Hewitt Bernard. The couple had first met in Quebec in 1860, though Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856. They married on February 16, 1867, at St. George's, Hanover Square in London—just months before Macdonald became Canada's first Prime Minister. Agnes was 31 years old to Macdonald's 52, and she would prove to be a devoted and politically astute partner.[^50][^51]

In 1869, Agnes gave birth to their only child, Margaret Mary Theodora Macdonald, who was born severely handicapped, both mentally and physically. The birth of a disabled daughter was another personal tragedy for Macdonald, though Agnes devoted herself to Margaret's care with extraordinary dedication. Despite these challenges, the marriage was by all accounts a happy and successful partnership. Agnes would prove instrumental in curbing her husband's drinking problem, and biographers suggest her efforts may have added as many as 20 years to his life.[^52][^53]

### Struggle with Alcohol

Macdonald had a serious but intermittent drinking problem for approximately 20 years beginning in 1856. Historians characterize it less as constant alcoholism and more as periodic binge-drinking—he wasn't perpetually drunk, but was known for extreme binges during which he would be incapacitated for days. These episodes had real political consequences. A crucial Militia bill in 1862 failed in part because Macdonald was suffering "one of his old attacks" during critical debates. He was drunk during the Fenian raid of 1866 when serving as Minister of Militia and Defence—too intoxicated to answer telegrams at a moment of national crisis.[^54][^55][^56]

His drinking affected his electoral standing in his home city of Kingston, where he went from a landslide victory in 1857 to personal defeat in 1878. However, by the 1870s, Macdonald took better control of his drinking, and the binges ended. His marriage to Agnes and growing public disapproval of inebriation in Victorian society probably explain his changed behavior. His wife proved unshakeable in her determination to curb his drinking, contributing significantly to his longevity and sustained political effectiveness in his later years.[^57][^58]

## Legacy

Sir John A. Macdonald's legacy is among the most contested in Canadian history. For over a century after his death, he was celebrated almost universally as the "Father of Confederation," the architect of Canadian nationhood, and the country's greatest political leader. Statues were erected, schools and streets were named in his honor, and his image appeared on currency. This heroic narrative emphasized his nation-building achievements while minimizing or ignoring his destructive policies toward Indigenous peoples and minorities.[^59]

However, during the past two decades, Macdonald has been fundamentally redefined in Canadian public consciousness as a central architect of colonialism and racism. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's detailed documentation of his role in establishing the residential school system—which the Commission characterized as cultural genocide—transformed public understanding of his legacy. His deliberate starvation policies, explicitly racist statements about Chinese and Indigenous peoples, and role in suppressing Indigenous rights have moved from historical footnotes to central features of his legacy.[^60][^61]

This reassessment has sparked widespread removal of Macdonald monuments and renaming of institutions. Victoria removed its Macdonald statue in 2018, followed by removals in Wilmot Township in 2020 and Regina in 2021. Montreal's statue was toppled and decapitated on August 29, 2020, during protests following George Floyd's murder, and the municipal government decided not to reinstate it. Toronto's statue has been encased in a wooden and burlap covering for nearly four years. As of 2024, only one Macdonald statue remains standing and uncovered on Parliament Hill.[^62][^63][^64]

The intense debate over Macdonald's legacy reflects broader questions about how nations should remember complex historical figures whose achievements cannot be separated from their crimes. Scholar Cindy Blackstock noted that statues "represent who you exalt in a culture," and their presence often occurs "in an absence of history"—most Canadians knew nothing of Macdonald's "genocidal policies" before recent reassessments. Other scholars argue that "perpetrators of genocide should never be forgotten, but they should not be celebrated either."[^65][^66]

Macdonald's political methodology also left a mixed legacy. He developed a centralized system of government patronage that strengthened the Conservative Party but established patterns of political corruption that would plague Canadian politics. He was far from the first politician to dispense patronage, but he maintained an unusually strong personal control over office-giving and used appointments as instruments to strengthen party loyalty at the local level, on the principle that reward should result only from actual service.[^67]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Macdonald's legacy acknowledge his wrongs while arguing that his nation-building achievements were essential to Canada's existence. More than 200 historians, policy experts, educators, business leaders, and public figures signed a joint statement in defense of Macdonald in January 2021, organized by the Friends of Sir John A. Macdonald and the Macdonald-Laurier Institute. The statement argued that Macdonald's "undoubted errors must be weighed against an impressive record of constitution and nation building, his reconciliation of contending cultures, languages and religions, his progressivism and his documented concern for and friendship with the Indigenous peoples of Canada."[^68][^69]

Supporters emphasize that Macdonald, alongside contemporaries like George-Étienne Cartier, overcame sectarian and linguistic strife and years of mistrust and political deadlock to create Canada. His wide-ranging nation-building efforts included constructing the transcontinental railway, expanding Canada to the Pacific and Arctic, and opening the western plains for settlement. Historian Swainson suggests that Macdonald's desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook and contributed immeasurably to its character.[^70][^71]

Defenders also point to his political skills and coalition-building abilities. As described by scholar Dutil, Macdonald was a "resourceful pragmatist and canny opportunist who mixed and matched conservative and liberal philosophies to maintain power as prime minister." His ability to dampen ethnic and religious conflicts, especially between French and English Canadians, set a pattern for successful political leadership at the national level. Some scholars argue that without Macdonald, Canada might not exist as an independent nation or might have been absorbed by the United States during the vulnerable decades following Confederation.[^72][^73][^74]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that acknowledging Macdonald's role in creating Canada does not require celebrating or honoring him, particularly given the genocidal nature of his policies toward Indigenous peoples. University of Ottawa professor Brenda Macdougall argues that "the idea that we can't hold historical figures to contemporary moral/values is just wrong," noting that "we select people to honor based on our contemporary or living values." In this view, Macdonald may have been a nation-builder, but "he was also a racist colonizer who used his position and his power to advance clearly racist goals in the most awful ways."[^75][^76]

Modern scholars emphasize that Macdonald's policies toward Indigenous peoples were not merely regrettable products of their time but deliberate acts of cultural destruction. His statements about residential schools explicitly articulated the goal of destroying Indigenous cultures by removing children from their families. His starvation policies represented conscious use of hunger as a weapon of colonial control. His racist statements about Chinese and Indigenous peoples were extreme even by the standards of his era.[^77]

Some scholars argue that statues and honors actually erase history by presenting simplified, heroic narratives that obscure the full record of historical figures. Before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's work, few Canadians knew about Macdonald's role in the residential school system or his deliberate starvation policies. In this view, removing celebratory monuments while incorporating his full history into education represents more honest historical reckoning than maintaining statues with carefully written plaques attempting to provide "context."[^78][^79]

University of Saskatchewan scholars concluded that "John A. Macdonald should not be forgotten, nor celebrated." This middle position argues for teaching Macdonald's complete history—both his nation-building achievements and his colonial crimes—without honoring him through monuments and place names. The position reflects growing consensus that understanding history requires confronting uncomfortable truths rather than maintaining comfortable myths about national founders.[^80]
