## Summary

Karlheinz Stockhausen was a German composer who was the most radical innovator of the postwar avant-garde. His electronic works Gesang der Junglinge and Kontakte, and his monumental opera cycle Licht, pushed the boundaries of what music could be. He pioneered spatial music, aleatory techniques, and electronic composition.
