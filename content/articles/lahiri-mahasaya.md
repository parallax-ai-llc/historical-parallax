## Summary

Lahiri Mahasaya was an Indian yogi and teacher who was a key figure in the revival of Kriya Yoga in modern India. He was initiated into Kriya Yoga by his guru Babaji in the Himalayas. Unusually for a great yogi, he was a householder — a married man with a career as an accountant. He taught that spiritual practice could be integrated with ordinary family and working life. He was the guru of Sri Yukteswar, who in turn taught Paramahansa Yogananda.
