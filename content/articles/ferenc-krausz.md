## Summary

Ferenc Krausz is a Hungarian-Austrian physicist who shared the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light. He created the first attosecond pulse of light in 2001 and demonstrated its use in studying electron motion. His work pioneered the field of attosecond physics, enabling observation of the fastest processes in nature.
