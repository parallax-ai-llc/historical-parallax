## Summary

Seonjo (born November 26, 1552; died March 16, 1608) was the 14th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1567 to 1608.[^1] His initial reputation as a wise monarch who promoted Neo-Confucian scholarship (Sarim faction) was completely shattered by the **Imjin War** (Japanese Invasions of 1592–1598). Widely criticized for his incompetence during the war—abandoning the capital, failing to prepare defenses, and displaying intense jealousy towards national hero **Yi Sun-sin**—Seonjo is deeply controversial. His reign also saw the crystallization of Joseon's factional politics (**Bubdang**), dividing the court into Easterners and Westerners.[^2]

## The Flight from Seoul

When **Toyotomi Hideyoshi**'s Japanese forces invaded in 1592, the Joseon defenses collapsed within weeks.
*   **Abandoning the Capital:** As the enemy approached Seoul, Seonjo made the fateful decision to flee north to Pyongyang and then to Uiju (Chinese border), abandoning his people. The angry citizens of Seoul burned down the palaces in protest.[^3]
*   **Request for Aid:** From the border, he desperately pleaded for Ming China's intervention, which eventually helped turn the tide of the war.

## Jealousy and Yi Sun-sin

Seonjo's relationship with Admiral **Yi Sun-sin** is infamous.
*   **Fear of a Hero:** While Yi Sun-sin saved the nation with miraculous naval victories (Hansan Island, Myeongnyang), Seonjo grew increasingly paranoid that the Admiral's popularity would threaten his own throne.
*   **Torture:** In 1597, influenced by Japanese counter-intelligence and jealous courtiers, Seonjo ordered Yi Sun-sin's arrest. The hero was tortured and nearly executed before being demoted to a common soldier. Seonjo only reinstated him when the navy was nearly annihilated at the Battle of Chilcheonryang.[^4]

## Factional Politics (Bungdang)

Seonjo's reign marked the beginning of entrenched political factionalism.
*   **East vs West:** The Sarim scholars split into the **Easterners** (Dongin) and **Westerners** (Seoin) over personnel appointments. This division deepened, with the Easterners further splitting into Southerners and Northerners. These factions spent more energy fighting each other than preparing for the Japanese invasion.[^5]

## Post-War and Succession

The war left Joseon in ruins. Seonjo spent his final years trying to rebuild, but the succession issue loomed large.
*   **Gwanghaegun:** His illegitimate son Gwanghaegun had led the war effort brilliantly, but Seonjo belatedly had a legitimate son (Grand Prince Yeongchang) with his new young Queen Inmok. Seonjo showed favor to the infant Yeongchang, creating a dangerous succession crisis that would explode after his death.[^6]
