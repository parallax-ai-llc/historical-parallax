## Summary

Robert Brown was a Scottish botanist who is best known for his description of Brownian motion — the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid. He also discovered the cell nucleus in plant cells and made major contributions to plant taxonomy. His observation of Brownian motion was later explained by Einstein using atomic theory, providing evidence for the existence of atoms.
