## Summary

Abraham Isaac Kook was the first Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi of British Mandatory Palestine and one of the most influential Jewish thinkers of the 20th century. He developed a mystical philosophy that saw secular Zionism as part of God's divine plan for redemption. He sought to bridge the gap between secular and religious Jews, arguing that even secular pioneers were unwittingly serving divine purposes. His mystical writings blend Kabbalah, philosophy, and poetry.
