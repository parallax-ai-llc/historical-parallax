## Summary

Umar ibn al-Khattab (584-644 CE) was the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate, serving from 634 to 644 CE, and is considered one of the most influential figures in Islamic history. Known for his strict justice, administrative genius, and military conquests, Umar transformed the early Islamic state from a regional power into a vast empire spanning three continents. His ten-year reign witnessed unprecedented territorial expansion, including the conquest of the Persian Sassanid Empire and significant portions of the Byzantine Empire. Despite his achievements, his rule also involved controversial policies and military campaigns that have generated debate among historians. He was assassinated in 644 CE by a Persian slave, leaving behind a complex legacy that continues to shape Islamic political thought and jurisprudence.

## Early Life and Background

Umar ibn al-Khattab was born in Mecca around 584 CE into the Banu Adi clan of the Quraysh tribe, one of the most powerful tribes in pre-Islamic Arabia[^1]. His father, Khattab ibn Nufayl, was a prominent figure in Meccan society, and Umar grew up in relative comfort compared to many of his contemporaries. Unlike many Arabs of his time, Umar learned to read and write, which was a rare skill that would later prove invaluable in his administrative career[^2].

Before embracing Islam, Umar was known as a fierce and physically imposing man who worked as a trader and wrestler. He was deeply devoted to the traditional polytheistic religion of the Quraysh and was initially one of the most vocal opponents of Muhammad's message[^3]. Historical sources describe him as hot-tempered, proud, and uncompromising in his beliefs, characteristics that would both aid and complicate his later leadership[^4].

Umar's conversion to Islam in 616 CE, six years after Muhammad began preaching, marked a turning point for the early Muslim community. According to Islamic tradition, Umar set out to kill Muhammad but was redirected to his own sister's house, where he found her and her husband secretly reading the Quran. After initially beating them in rage, he read the verses himself and was so moved that he immediately went to Muhammad and converted[^5]. His conversion significantly strengthened the Muslim community, as his physical prowess and social standing provided protection and legitimacy to the fledgling movement[^6].

During the Meccan period of Muhammad's prophethood, Umar became one of his closest companions and advisors. His suggestion that Muslims pray openly at the Kaaba, despite persecution, demonstrated his fearless character[^7]. When Muslims migrated to Medina in 622 CE, Umar was among those who made the journey, and he quickly became integral to the community's political and military organization[^8].

## Rise to Power

Umar's ascent to the caliphate was both expected and contested. During Muhammad's lifetime, Umar served as a senior advisor and was frequently consulted on matters of law, warfare, and governance[^9]. Muhammad reportedly said, "If there were to be a prophet after me, it would be Umar," indicating the high regard in which he was held[^10]. This close relationship positioned Umar as a natural candidate for leadership after Muhammad's death in 632 CE.

When Muhammad died, the Muslim community faced its first succession crisis. Abu Bakr, Muhammad's close friend and father of his wife Aisha, was chosen as the first caliph largely through Umar's decisive action. In the critical meeting at Saqifah, where various factions debated leadership, Umar was the first to pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr, effectively ending the dispute and preventing potential civil war[^11]. This demonstrated Umar's political acumen and his ability to act decisively in moments of crisis.

During Abu Bakr's brief two-year reign (632-634 CE), Umar served as his chief advisor and de facto second-in-command. He played a crucial role in the Ridda Wars (Wars of Apostasy), which consolidated Muslim control over the Arabian Peninsula after several tribes attempted to break away following Muhammad's death[^12]. These campaigns, though brutal, established the principle that conversion to Islam was irrevocable and strengthened the central authority of Medina[^13].

On his deathbed in 634 CE, Abu Bakr nominated Umar as his successor, a decision that was accepted by the Muslim community with minimal opposition[^14]. Unlike the contested succession after Muhammad, Umar's appointment was relatively smooth, reflecting both Abu Bakr's authority and Umar's established reputation. Upon assuming the caliphate, Umar adopted the title "Amir al-Mu'minin" (Commander of the Faithful), a title that would be used by subsequent caliphs[^15].

Umar's first acts as caliph demonstrated his commitment to justice and accountability. He famously declared that he would be held accountable for even "a goat that dies on the banks of the Euphrates" if he failed in his duties[^16]. He also established the principle that the caliph was not above the law, famously allowing himself to be questioned and challenged by ordinary Muslims[^17]. This approach, combined with his austere personal lifestyle, earned him widespread respect and legitimacy among his subjects.

## Major Achievements

Umar's caliphate is distinguished by extraordinary military conquests and administrative innovations that laid the foundation for Islamic civilization. Within ten years, the Islamic state expanded from the Arabian Peninsula to encompass territories stretching from Libya to Central Asia, making it one of the largest empires in history up to that point[^18].

**Military Conquests**: The most spectacular achievement of Umar's reign was the conquest of the Persian Sassanid Empire. The decisive Battle of Qadisiyyah in 636 CE broke Persian power in Mesopotamia, followed by the fall of the capital Ctesiphon in 637 CE[^19]. By 644 CE, the entire Sassanid Empire had collapsed, ending nearly 400 years of Persian rule and incorporating vast territories into the Islamic state[^20]. These conquests were facilitated by both the military genius of commanders like Khalid ibn al-Walid and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas, and the weakened state of Persia after decades of war with Byzantium[^21].

Simultaneously, Umar's forces made significant inroads into Byzantine territory. Syria was conquered between 634-638 CE, with Damascus falling in 635 and Jerusalem surrendering in 637 CE after a siege[^22]. Egypt was invaded in 639 CE under the command of Amr ibn al-As, with Alexandria captured in 641 CE, depriving Byzantium of its wealthiest province[^23]. These victories were not merely military triumphs but also resulted from the Christian populations' dissatisfaction with Byzantine religious persecution and heavy taxation[^24].

**Administrative Reforms**: Umar's genius extended beyond military matters to administrative innovation. He established the Diwan, a sophisticated bureaucratic system that maintained records of military personnel, their salaries, and land grants[^25]. This system, borrowed and adapted from Persian and Byzantine models, created an efficient mechanism for managing the rapidly expanding empire[^26].

He instituted a stipend system (ata) that distributed revenues from conquered territories to Muslims based on their precedence in accepting Islam and their service to the community[^27]. While this created a privileged class, it also ensured social stability by providing for warriors and early converts. The annual stipend ranged from 5,000 dirhams for those who fought at Badr (Muhammad's first major battle) to 200-300 dirhams for later converts[^28].

**Legal and Judicial Innovations**: Umar established the Islamic calendar (Hijri calendar) beginning from Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622 CE, providing a distinct temporal framework for the Islamic community[^29]. He created the office of Qadi (Islamic judge) as a separate institution from political governance, laying the groundwork for an independent judiciary[^30].

His legal rulings and interpretations became foundational to Islamic jurisprudence. He instituted the tarawih prayers during Ramadan as a congregational practice, suspended the hudud (corporal) punishment for theft during famine years, and established principles for dealing with conquered populations[^31]. His treaty with Jerusalem's Christian population, the Pact of Umar, became a model for Muslim treatment of religious minorities, guaranteeing their protection in exchange for payment of jizya (poll tax)[^32].

**Urban Development**: Umar founded numerous garrison cities (amsar) including Basra and Kufa in Iraq, and Fustat in Egypt, which served as military bases and administrative centers[^33]. These planned cities became major centers of Islamic learning and culture in subsequent centuries. He also ordered the expansion of the Prophet's Mosque in Medina and established the first Islamic police force and public welfare system[^34].

**Economic Policies**: Rather than distributing conquered lands to soldiers, Umar established the principle that conquered agricultural land (sawafi) remained the property of its original cultivators who paid a land tax (kharaj)[^35]. This ensured continued agricultural production and created a steady revenue stream for the state. He also reformed coinage and standardized weights and measures across the empire[^36].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Umar's caliphate involved policies and actions that have generated significant criticism from both contemporary opponents and modern scholars. His rule, while transformative, was also marked by violence, religious intolerance, and policies that privileged Arabs over other Muslims[^37].

**Military Brutality**: The conquests under Umar, while celebrated in Islamic historiography, involved considerable violence and destruction. The siege of Jerusalem, though ending in a negotiated surrender, involved months of deprivation for the city's inhabitants[^38]. The conquest of Persia resulted in the destruction of Zoroastrian temples, the killing of priests who resisted, and the effective collapse of an ancient civilization[^39]. While defenders argue these were typical of 7th-century warfare, critics note that the religious justification for these campaigns set precedents for later religious wars[^40].

The treatment of captured populations varied significantly. While some cities that surrendered peacefully received favorable terms, those that resisted faced harsh retribution, including enslavement of women and children[^41]. The Arab historian al-Baladhuri records numerous instances of massacres following successful sieges, though the reliability and scale of these accounts are debated[^42].

**Religious Intolerance**: Umar's policies toward non-Muslims, while less harsh than later periods, established discriminatory practices that became institutionalized. The jizya tax, while providing protection, was explicitly designed to be humiliating, with the Quranic instruction that it be paid "while they are in a state of submission"[^43]. Historical accounts describe collection methods designed to emphasize dhimmi (non-Muslim) subservience[^44].

He reportedly expelled Jews and Christians from the Arabian Peninsula, declaring that "two religions shall not coexist in the land of the Arabs"[^45]. This policy, based on a reported saying of Muhammad, resulted in the forced displacement of ancient communities from their ancestral lands[^46]. Modern historians debate the extent and implementation of this policy, with some suggesting it was limited to the Hijaz region, while others argue it was more broadly applied[^47].

**Sectarian Divisions**: Umar's relationship with the family of Muhammad, particularly Ali ibn Abi Talib and his wife Fatimah (Muhammad's daughter), was fraught with tension. Shia Muslims view Umar as a usurper who prevented Ali's rightful succession to leadership after Muhammad's death[^48]. The dispute over Fatimah's inheritance of the land of Fadak, which Umar as Abu Bakr's chief supporter denied, remains a source of Sunni-Shia contention[^49].

Some Shia traditions contain harsh condemnations of Umar, accusing him of breaking into Fatimah's house and causing injuries that led to her death, though Sunni scholars reject these accounts as later fabrications[^50]. Regardless of the historical accuracy, these narratives reflect deep-seated sectarian grievances that trace back to Umar's caliphate.

**Arab Supremacism**: Critics argue that Umar's policies institutionalized Arab ethnic superiority within the Islamic state. The stipend system explicitly privileged Arab Muslims over non-Arab converts (mawali), creating a two-tier system that contradicted Islam's egalitarian message[^51]. Non-Arab Muslims were initially excluded from the Diwan and received lower stipends even when they served in the military[^52].

His establishment of garrison cities segregated Arab Muslims from conquered populations, limiting intermarriage and cultural exchange. While defenders argue this preserved the religious identity of Muslims in newly conquered territories, critics see it as a form of ethnic apartheid that fostered resentment among non-Arab Muslims[^53].

**Authoritarian Tendencies**: While Umar promoted accountability and justice, his rule was also marked by authoritarian measures. He established a secret service (ashraaf) to monitor provincial governors and report on dissent[^54]. He dismissed Khalid ibn al-Walid, Islam's greatest military commander, partly due to political jealousy and fear of his popularity among troops[^55]. He also instituted harsh corporal punishments, including flogging for various offenses, and was known for personally beating people he deemed to have transgressed[^56].

His temperament, described as harsh and intimidating, created an atmosphere of fear. According to Islamic sources, people were more afraid of Umar than of Muhammad himself[^57]. While this maintained discipline and reduced corruption, it also stifled dissent and created a precedent for authoritarian governance in Islamic political thought[^58].

## Personal Life

Umar's personal life was characterized by extreme asceticism, multiple marriages, and a complex personality that combined tenderness with severity. Despite ruling an empire of unprecedented wealth, Umar maintained a lifestyle of deliberate poverty, wearing patched clothes and eating simple food, often going hungry to understand the plight of the poor[^59].

**Marriages and Children**: Umar was married at least nine times throughout his life, both before and after converting to Islam. His wives included Zaynab bint Mazh'un, Umm Kulthum bint Ali (the daughter of Ali ibn Abi Talib and granddaughter of Muhammad, though this marriage is disputed by some Shia scholars), and Atikah bint Zayd[^60]. These marriages served both personal and political purposes, creating alliances and strengthening ties within the Muslim community.

He fathered approximately thirteen children, including several sons who became prominent in early Islamic history. His son Abdullah ibn Umar became one of the most respected scholars and hadith transmitters, known for his piety and legal expertise[^61]. His daughter Hafsah became one of Muhammad's wives and was entrusted with the first compiled manuscript of the Quran after Muhammad's death[^62].

**Personality and Character**: Islamic sources present a complex portrait of Umar's personality. He was known for weeping easily, particularly when reciting or hearing Quranic verses, despite his intimidating physical presence[^63]. He made night rounds through Medina disguised to assess the condition of his subjects, personally helping widows, orphers, and the needy[^64]. These nightly patrols became legendary, demonstrating his hands-on approach to governance and genuine concern for social welfare.

However, he was also known for his violent temper. Before embracing Islam, he beat his slave girl for converting to Islam, and even after conversion, he was quick to use corporal punishment[^65]. His daughter Hafsah reportedly said, "I have never seen anyone whose anger is more severe than his"[^66]. Yet this anger was typically directed at wrongdoing and injustice rather than personal slights, and he was known to quickly forgive those who challenged him if they were right[^67].

**Physical Appearance**: Historical descriptions portray Umar as tall and physically imposing, with a reddish-white complexion, bald head, and dyed beard[^68]. His height and strength made him a formidable presence, and he was skilled in wrestling and martial arts[^69]. Despite his age (approximately 60 at death), he maintained physical vigor and personally led military campaigns.

**Spiritual Life**: Umar's piety was expressed through constant self-examination and fear of divine judgment. He reportedly said, "If a caller from heaven announced that all people would enter Paradise except one, I would fear that I would be that one"[^70]. He frequently wept when reciting verses about divine punishment and was known for his long night prayers[^71].

His relationship with Muhammad was one of deep love and respect, though he sometimes disagreed with the Prophet's decisions, particularly regarding treatment of prisoners after the Battle of Badr[^72]. Muhammad valued Umar's counsel and often adopted his suggestions, with several Quranic verses revealed in accordance with Umar's opinions, which became known as "muwafaqat" (agreements of Umar)[^73].

## Legacy

Umar ibn al-Khattab's legacy profoundly shaped Islamic civilization, political thought, and jurisprudence for over a millennium. His reign established institutional frameworks and precedents that influenced not only Islamic empires but also European administrative practices through cultural transmission[^74].

**Political Legacy**: Umar's model of caliphal governance became the ideal standard in Sunni political thought. His emphasis on consultation (shura), accountability, and the caliph's duty to serve rather than be served established principles that later Muslim reformers repeatedly invoked[^75]. The concept of "Umar's justice" became synonymous with ideal Islamic governance, contrasting with the perceived tyranny of later dynastic rulers[^76].

His administrative innovations, particularly the Diwan system, were adopted and refined by the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, and later by the Ottoman Empire[^77]. The separation of military, administrative, and judicial functions that Umar initiated became fundamental to Islamic governance[^78]. Even the Mughal Empire in India drew on administrative precedents established during Umar's caliphate[^79].

**Legal Legacy**: Umar's legal rulings and principles became foundational sources in Islamic jurisprudence. His method of ijtihad (independent reasoning) when faced with unprecedented situations established the legitimacy of legal innovation within Islamic tradition[^80]. The four major Sunni schools of law (madhabs) all cite Umar's rulings and precedents extensively in their legal texts[^81].

His suspension of hudud punishments during famine, prioritizing justice over literal application of law, established the principle that Islamic law must consider context and circumstances[^82]. This precedent has been invoked by modern reformers seeking to adapt Islamic law to contemporary conditions[^83].

**Military Legacy**: The conquest strategy developed under Umar—combining military force with generous terms for those who surrendered peacefully—became the model for subsequent Islamic expansions[^84]. His policy of establishing garrison cities rather than dispersing soldiers among conquered populations preserved military effectiveness while facilitating later waves of conquest[^85].

The rapid conquest of such vast territories with relatively small forces (estimates suggest 30,000-40,000 Arab fighters conquered territories inhabited by millions) demonstrated the power of military organization, motivation, and tactical innovation[^86]. Military historians continue to study these campaigns as examples of asymmetric warfare and the exploitation of enemy weaknesses[^87].

**Religious Legacy**: For Sunni Muslims, Umar is revered as one of the "Rashidun" (Rightly Guided Caliphs) whose example should be emulated. He is considered second only to Abu Bakr in merit among the companions of Muhammad[^88]. Countless hadith narrations preserve his sayings and actions, which continue to guide Muslim practice and belief[^89].

However, in Shia Islam, Umar's legacy is predominantly negative. He is viewed as a usurper who denied Ali his rightful position and oppressed the Prophet's family[^90]. This divergent assessment of Umar remains a fundamental difference between Sunni and Shia theological and historical narratives[^91].

**Cultural Impact**: Umar appears as a character in countless works of Islamic literature, poetry, and drama. His nightly rounds, his justice, and his humility became subjects of popular stories that conveyed moral lessons[^92]. In modern times, he has been the subject of television series, films, and biographical works across the Muslim world[^93].

His name remains one of the most popular names for Muslim boys globally, reflecting his enduring status as an exemplary figure[^94]. Streets, mosques, schools, and institutions throughout the Islamic world bear his name, testifying to his continued cultural significance[^95].

**Modern Interpretations**: Contemporary Islamic movements interpret Umar's legacy in divergent ways. Conservative movements emphasize his strict implementation of Islamic law and his expansion of Islamic territory through military conquest[^96]. Reformist movements highlight his flexibility in legal reasoning, his emphasis on social justice, and his accountability to the people[^97].

Some modern scholars have critiqued Umar's legacy, arguing that his militarism and authoritarian tendencies contributed to autocratic traditions in Islamic political culture[^98]. Others defend him as a product of his time whose achievements must be understood in historical context rather than judged by modern standards[^99].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic and traditional Islamic scholarship has extensively praised Umar's administrative genius, military achievements, and personal piety. Sir William Muir, the 19th-century Scottish orientalist, despite his critical stance toward Islam, acknowledged Umar as "a man of genius and energy" whose "administration was marked by wisdom, justice, and vigor"[^100].

Contemporary historian Hugh Kennedy describes Umar's caliphate as "the most formative period in the development of the Muslim state," noting that "the administrative structures he established proved remarkably durable"[^101]. Kennedy argues that Umar's genius lay in adapting existing Byzantine and Persian administrative models while infusing them with Islamic values and Arab military efficiency[^102].

Muslim scholars traditionally present Umar as the embodiment of Islamic virtues. Imam al-Dhahabi (1274-1348), the renowned Islamic historian, wrote that "Umar was the most feared, the most just, and the most knowledgeable in the religion after Abu Bakr"[^103]. Ibn Kathir (1301-1373) devoted extensive portions of his historical works to documenting Umar's virtues and achievements, presenting him as second only to Abu Bakr among the companions[^104].

Modern Muslim intellectuals like Muhammad Asad praised Umar's emphasis on social justice and consultation, arguing that his model of governance represents "true Islamic democracy" in contrast to later authoritarian regimes[^105]. Pakistani scholar Maulana Maududi presented Umar's caliphate as proof that Islamic governance could be both just and effective, using it as a model for his vision of an Islamic state[^106].

Western historians like Fred Donner acknowledge that "Umar's administrative and fiscal arrangements provided the framework within which the early Islamic state could consolidate its control over vast new territories"[^107]. Even scholars critical of Islamic expansion recognize Umar's organizational abilities and the relative moderation of his policies compared to contemporary Byzantine and Persian rulers[^108].

His personal asceticism and commitment to justice have been celebrated across religious and cultural boundaries. The story of Umar sleeping under a tree with no guards while ruling an empire became emblematic of servant leadership in Islamic political discourse[^109]. His statement "Where did you get this?" to his son who wore fine clothes, demonstrating that rulers' families should not profit from public office, established an anti-corruption principle that resonates in contemporary governance debates[^110].

Sufi traditions venerate Umar for his spiritual depth and his ability to combine worldly authority with spiritual humility. Rumi and other Sufi poets referenced Umar's tears and his fear of divine judgment as examples of true piety[^111]. This spiritual dimension of Umar's legacy often receives less attention than his political and military achievements but remains significant in Islamic devotional literature[^112].

### Negative Views

Scholarly criticism of Umar has come from multiple directions, including Shia theological opposition, post-colonial critique of Islamic conquests, and feminist analysis of his gender policies. These critical perspectives challenge the hagiographic narratives that dominate traditional Islamic historiography.

Shia scholars and theologians have maintained consistent criticism of Umar since the early Islamic period. Shia hadith collections contain numerous narrations condemning Umar's role in preventing Ali's succession and his alleged mistreatment of Fatimah[^113]. Contemporary Shia scholars like Ayatollah Khomeini referred to the first three caliphs, including Umar, as usurpers who "wrongfully seized" power from the Prophet's family[^114].

Modern critical historians have questioned the triumphalist narratives of Umar's conquests. Robert Hoyland notes that "the Arab conquests involved considerable violence and displacement, aspects often minimized in traditional Islamic sources"[^115]. Tom Holland's "In the Shadow of the Sword" presents the Islamic conquests, including those under Umar, as typical imperial expansion driven by material rather than purely religious motives[^116].

Post-colonial scholars have analyzed Umar's policies through the lens of ethnic discrimination and imperial exploitation. The stipend system that privileged Arab Muslims over non-Arab converts has been interpreted as institutionalized racism that contradicted Islam's egalitarian message[^117]. Patricia Crone argued that the early Islamic state, including under Umar, was primarily an "Arab kingdom" rather than a universal religious community[^118].

Feminist scholars have criticized Umar's reportedly harsh attitudes toward women. Traditions describe him as opposing women's participation in mosque prayers and advocating for strict gender segregation[^119]. His alleged statement that "women are toys, choose them carefully" has been cited as evidence of misogynistic attitudes, though the authenticity of such narrations is disputed[^120]. Fatima Mernissi and other Muslim feminists have argued that Umar's personal conservatism regarding gender issues influenced Islamic law in ways that oppressed women[^121].

Some Western scholars have presented Umar's military campaigns as early examples of religious imperialism. Bernard Lewis, while acknowledging Umar's administrative abilities, characterized the early Islamic conquests as "one of the most significant and far-reaching movements of population and conquest in history," with profound and not always positive consequences for conquered peoples[^122].

Critics of political Islam have used Umar's example to argue that the Islamic political tradition is inherently authoritarian and expansionist. Writers like Ibn Warraq have pointed to Umar's intolerance of religious diversity within Arabia and his aggressive military expansion as evidence that early Islam was fundamentally imperialistic[^123].

Even some Sunni reformist scholars have offered qualified criticism of aspects of Umar's legacy. The emphasis on military conquest and territorial expansion has been questioned by those seeking a more pacifistic interpretation of Islam[^124]. His authoritarian methods, while effective, have been contrasted unfavorably with Muhammad's more consultative approach by scholars advocating for democratic governance in Muslim societies[^125].

## Famous Quotes

> "May Allah have mercy on the man who shows me my faults."

This quote exemplifies Umar's commitment to accountability and his belief that leaders should welcome criticism rather than suppress it. It became a foundational principle in Islamic political thought regarding the rights of citizens to question their rulers[^126].

> "I have been given four characteristics that I love: patience in adversity, generosity when I have wealth, dignity in poverty, and justice when I have power."

This statement reflects Umar's self-assessment of his character virtues, particularly his emphasis on justice as the defining characteristic of proper governance. It has been widely quoted in Islamic literature on leadership and ethics[^127].

> "Do not be fooled by one who recites the Quran. His recitation is but speech, but look to those who act according to it."

Umar's emphasis on practice over mere verbal profession became an important principle in Islamic spirituality, distinguishing genuine piety from hypocritical religiosity. This quote is frequently cited in sermons and religious instruction[^128].

> "I fear that after a long time has passed, people will say, 'We do not find the verses of stoning in the Book of Allah,' and thus go astray by abandoning an obligation that Allah revealed."

This controversial statement regarding the punishment for adultery demonstrates Umar's strict interpretation of Islamic law. His claim that a verse prescribing stoning was originally part of the Quran but not included in the final text has generated extensive theological debate[^129].

> "If poverty were a man, I would kill him."

This powerful metaphor expressed Umar's commitment to eliminating poverty through social welfare policies. His establishment of state stipends and welfare programs represented an early attempt at addressing economic inequality, and this quote has been invoked by advocates of Islamic economics[^130].

> "I wish I had asked the Messenger of Allah three questions: about the caliphate after him, about people who claim a share in this matter, and about the inheritance of grandfathers and grandmothers."

Spoken near the end of his life, this quote reveals Umar's regrets about not seeking clarification on issues that would later cause division in the Muslim community, particularly the question of succession[^131].
