## Summary

The Euromaidan, also known as the Revolution of Dignity, was Ukraine's second major democratic uprising in a decade—and the one that changed everything. Beginning in November 2013 when President Viktor Yanukovych abruptly rejected an association agreement with the European Union in favor of closer ties with Russia, the protests grew from a pro-European demonstration into a mass movement against corruption, authoritarianism, and Russian dominance. For three months, hundreds of thousands occupied Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square).[^1]

The revolution turned bloody in February 2014. Government snipers opened fire on protesters, killing over 100 people in what became the deadliest political violence in modern Ukrainian history. The victims are remembered as the "Heavenly Hundred" (Nebesnaya Sotnya). On February 22, 2014, Yanukovych fled to Russia, and parliament voted to remove him from power. A new government oriented toward Europe took over.[^2]

But Russia's response was swift. Within weeks, unmarked Russian troops seized Crimea; a sham referendum followed, and Putin annexed the peninsula—the first forcible border change in Europe since World War II. Pro-Russian separatists, backed by Moscow, then launched an insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Euromaidan thus ignited the Russo-Ukrainian War, which in 2022 became a full-scale invasion. The revolution's legacy is being written in blood and resistance.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Ukraine's Orange Revolution (2004)

In 2004, massive protests overturned a fraudulent election:
- Viktor Yushchenko vs. Viktor Yanukovych
- Russian-backed Yanukovych initially declared winner
- Millions protested; new election; Yushchenko won
- But subsequent years disappointed: corruption continued; economy stagnated[^4]

### Yanukovych's Return (2010)

In 2010, Yanukovych won a fair election:
- Defeated Yulia Tymoshenko
- Imprisoned Tymoshenko on dubious charges
- Consolidated power; increased corruption
- Maneuvered between EU and Russia[^5]

### EU Association Agreement

For years, Ukraine negotiated an Association Agreement with the EU:
- Would deepen economic ties and require reforms
- Popular aspiration for European integration
- Russia pressured Ukraine to join Eurasian Union instead
- **November 21, 2013:** Yanukovych suspended the EU agreement

This triggered the protests.[^6]

## The Protests

### Phase 1: Euromaidan Begins (November 2013)

**November 21:** First protests at Maidan after EU deal suspended
**November 24:** Large march (~100,000)
**November 30:** Berkut riot police brutally attacked peaceful protesters at night—the "Rozgon" (dispersal). This violence radicalized the movement.
**December 1:** 500,000+ marched; protesters occupied government buildings

The slogans shifted from "Sign the EU deal" to "Yanukovych must go."[^7]

### Phase 2: Occupation and Escalation (December 2013 - January 2014)

Maidan became a fortified protest camp:
- Self-organized; thousands slept on the square
- Tents, barricades, field kitchens
- Volunteer medical units
- Diverse participants: students, pensioners, nationalists, liberals
- Music, speeches, solidarity

**January 16, 2014:** Parliament passed "Dictatorship Laws"—banning protests, restricting media. This fueled outrage.

**January 22, 2014:** First shooting deaths—Serhiy Nigoyan and others killed by security forces.[^8]

### Phase 3: The Bloodiest Days (February 2014)

**February 18-20:** Yanukovych ordered a massive assault:
- Violence erupted; protesters pushed toward government buildings
- Security forces used live ammunition
- **February 20: The Massacre**—snipers fired on crowds from rooftops
- 48+ protesters killed in hours

**February 21:** EU-mediated agreement signed—but Yanukovych had lost support
**February 22:** Yanukovych fled Kyiv; parliament voted to remove him; protesters entered his abandoned residence and found evidence of lavish corruption[^9]

## The Heavenly Hundred

The 108 protesters killed between January and February 2014 are honored as the "Heavenly Hundred":

- Youngest: 16 years old
- Oldest: 83 years old
- Included Ukrainians, Belarusians, Armenians, Georgians

The term emerged during the funeral ceremonies on Maidan. February 20 is now commemorated as Day of the Heavenly Hundred Heroes.[^10]

### The Snipers Question

**Ukrainian investigations:**
- Concluded Berkut (riot police) officers fired on protesters
- Forensic evidence matched bullets to Berkut rifles
- 27 Berkut officers identified
- 2023: Three convicted in absentia

**Contested narratives:**
- Some researchers (Ivan Katchanovski) argue some fire came from opposition-controlled buildings—a claim amplified by Russian propaganda but not supported by mainstream investigations
- Debate continues over command responsibility[^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Ukrainian/Western Perspective

**Revolution of Dignity:** Euromaidan was a genuine popular uprising for democracy, European values, and an end to corruption. Ukrainians chose their future despite deadly repression. The Heavenly Hundred are martyrs for freedom. Russian intervention proves the threat Ukraine faced was real.[^15]

**Unfinished Revolution:** Post-Maidan Ukraine has made progress (anti-corruption reforms, decentralization, EU candidacy) but problems remain. The 2022 invasion united the country like never before.

### Russian Perspective

**Western-Backed Coup:** Russia portrays Euromaidan as an illegal overthrow of a legitimate president, orchestrated by the US and EU. Far-right nationalists allegedly dominated the movement. Russia's actions in Crimea were defensive—protecting Russian speakers from a "fascist" government.

This narrative is rejected by most Western scholars and Ukrainians but shapes Russian policy.[^16]

### Critical Analysis

**Complexity:** The revolution was genuinely popular but also included far-right elements (Right Sector, Svoboda). Their presence was exaggerated by Russian propaganda but existed. Post-Maidan governments struggled with corruption despite reforms.

**Consequences:** Euromaidan won the battle but triggered a war that continues. Ukraine's European aspirations are now paid for in blood.[^17]
