## Summary

Solomon Berson co-developed radioimmunoassay (RIA) with Rosalyn Yalow, a technique that revolutionized clinical chemistry and endocrinology. His insight that insulin-binding antibodies existed overturned prevailing immunological theory. He died before the 1977 Nobel Prize was awarded to Yalow, as the prize is not given posthumously.
