## Overview

Colonel Oleg Penkovsky (Codename: HERO) was a GRU colonel who became the most valuable spy for the West during the Cold War. Disillusioned with Khrushchev's reckless nuclear brinkmanship, he approached MI6 and the CIA. He provided thousands of photographed documents, including the **technical manuals for Soviet nuclear missile sites**.
**The Crucial Moment:**
During the Cuban Missile Crisis, U-2 spy planes photographed strange construction in Cuba. CIA analysts used Penkovsky's manuals to confirm: **"These are nuclear missile launch pads."** Because of him, JFK knew exactly what the Soviets had and (more importantly) *what they didn't have* (their ICBM range was exaggerated).

## The End

The KGB became suspicious. They noticed him meeting British businessman Greville Wynne.
They bugged his apartment and put toxic dust on his chair to track his movements.
**Arrest (Oct 1962):** Just as the crisis was heating up, he was arrested.
**Execution (1963):**
Official story: Executed by firing squad.
Rumor (Vektor): He was burned alive in a crematorium oven while strapped to a stretcher, and the video was shown to new GRU recruits as a warning.
