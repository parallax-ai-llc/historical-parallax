## Summary

Carl Woese was an American microbiologist who revolutionized biology by discovering the Archaea, a third domain of life distinct from Bacteria and Eukarya. His use of ribosomal RNA sequences to classify organisms transformed phylogenetics and established the three-domain system of biological classification. Despite the significance of his discovery, he never received a Nobel Prize.
