## Summary

Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) was an Italian explorer who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean under Spanish sponsorship, opening the way for widespread European exploration and colonization of the Americas. His 1492 expedition, seeking a western route to Asia, instead reached the Caribbean, marking the beginning of sustained European contact with the Americas. While credited with "discovering" the New World, indigenous peoples had inhabited these lands for millennia, and Norse explorers had reached North America 500 years earlier. Columbus's voyages initiated the Columbian Exchange and European colonization, leading to massive demographic, cultural, and ecological changes—including the devastating depopulation of indigenous peoples through disease, violence, and exploitation.

## Background

Born in Genoa (Republic of Genoa, now Italy), Columbus became an experienced sailor. Inspired by Marco Polo's accounts and believing Earth was smaller than it is, he proposed sailing west to reach Asia's spice markets.

Portuguese King John II rejected his proposal. Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella eventually agreed (1492), seeking glory, gold, and spreading Christianity.

## The 1492 Voyage

**Three Ships**: *Niña*, *Pinta*, *Santa María*
**Departed**: August 3, 1492 (Palos de la Frontera, Spain)
**Landed**: October 12, 1492 (Bahamas, probably Guanahani/San Salvador)

Columbus believed he'd reached East Indies (hence "Indians" for indigenous people). Actually reached Caribbean.

Explored Cuba, Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic). *Santa María* wrecked; left 39 men at La Navidad (first European settlement, destroyed by time of his return).

**Returned**: March 1493, triumphant reception in Spain.

## Subsequent Voyages

**Second (1493-1496)**: 17 ships, 1,200 men. Established colonies, enslaved natives, found La Navidad destroyed.

**Third (1498-1500)**: Reached South American mainland (Venezuela). Colony in chaos; Columbus arrested, sent back to Spain in chains (later released).

**Fourth (1502-1504)**: Explored Central America. Stranded in Jamaica for a year. Returned to Spain, died in 1506 in relative obscurity.

## Legacy

**Columbian Exchange**: Transfer of plants, animals, culture, diseases, people between Old and New Worlds. Transformed global agriculture, cuisine, ecology.

**Colonization**: Opened Americas to European settlement and exploitation. Spanish Empire expanded massively.

**Indigenous Catastrophe**: 
- Diseases (smallpox, measles, etc.) killed ~90% of indigenous population
- Violence, slavery, forced labor
- Cultural destruction

**Controversy**: Columbus's role as enslaver and brutal governor has led to reevaluation. Columbus Day increasingly replaced or supplemented with Indigenous Peoples' Day in many places.
