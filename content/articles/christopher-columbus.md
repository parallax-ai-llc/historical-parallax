## Summary

Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) was a Genoese explorer who completed four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean under Spanish sponsorship, initiating sustained European contact with the Americas. His 1492 expedition, seeking a westward route to Asia, instead reached the Caribbean, fundamentally changing world history. While Columbus is credited with "discovering" the New World in European consciousness, indigenous peoples had inhabited these lands for tens of thousands of years, and Norse explorers had reached North America 500 years earlier. Columbus's voyages initiated the Columbian Exchange, European colonization, and the catastrophic depopulation of indigenous peoples. His legacy remains deeply controversial.

## The Enterprise of the Indies

### The Proposal

**Concept:**
Columbus believed he could reach Asia (the "Indies") by sailing west. Crucially, he vastly underestimated Earth's circumference.

**Calculations:**
Columbus estimated ~2,400 miles from Canary Islands to Japan. Actual distance: ~10,600 miles. Had the Americas not been there, his crew would have perished.

### Seeking Sponsorship

**Portugal (1484):**
King John II's experts correctly concluded distance too great. Rejected.

**Spain (1486-1492):**
After years of lobbying, Spanish monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella agreed (Granada conquest just concluded). Santángel fund money from Spanish treasury.

**Capitulations of Santa Fe (1492):**
Agreement granting Columbus:
- Title "Admiral of the Ocean Sea"
- Governorship of discovered lands
- 10% of all riches

- Cuba (thought it was Chinese mainland)
- Hispaniola (Haiti/Dominican Republic)

## Subsequent Voyages

### Second Voyage (1493-1496)

**Goal:** Colonization and conversion

**Findings:**
- La Navidad destroyed, all men dead
- Founded Isabela (first planned European settlement in Americas)
- Explored Jamaica, southern Cuba
- Enslaved indigenous people; instituted brutal tribute system

### Third Voyage (1498-1500)

**Discovery:**
Reached mainland South America (Venezuela). First European to touch American continent.

**Colony in Crisis:**
Hispaniola in chaos. Rebellion against Columbus's harsh rule. Spanish officials arrested Columbus and brothers, sent to Spain in chains.

**Released:**
Ferdinand and Isabella freed Columbus but stripped him of governorship.

### Fourth Voyage (1502-1504)

**"High Voyage":**
Explored Central American coast seeking passage to Indian Ocean.

**Stranded:**
Ships rotted in Jamaica. Marooned for a year. Used eclipse prediction to trick natives into providing food.

**Return:**
Returned to Spain broken in health.

**Age:** ~54-55

**Buried:**
Remains moved multiple times. Possibly in Seville Cathedral (DNA inconclusive).

## The Columbian Exchange

- European diseases (smallpox, measles, influenza, typhus)
- Horses, cattle, pigs, sheep
- Wheat, grapes, sugarcane
- Christianity
- European legal/political systems

- Potatoes, tomatoes, corn (maize), beans
- Tobacco, chocolate, rubber
- Turkeys
- Syphilis (possibly)

### Impact

Transformed agriculture, diet, economy, ecology worldwide.

## Indigenous Catastrophe

### Disease

**Epidemic Deaths:**
Diseases killed up to 90% of indigenous population within decades. No immunity to European pathogens.

**Taíno Population:**
Hispaniola: estimated 250,000-1,000,000 in 1492. By 1548: ~500 Taíno remained.

### Violence and Exploitation

**Slavery:**
Columbus enslaved Taíno from first voyage. Shipped hundreds to Spain.

**Encomienda:**
Forced labor system. Tribute demands. Punishment by mutilation, death.

**Brutality:**
Columbus authorized cutting off hands of those who failed to deliver gold quotas.

**Contemporary Criticism:**
Bartolomé de las Casas documented Spanish atrocities (* Destruction of the Indies*).

## Legacy and Controversy

### Celebration

- Columbus Day (U.S. federal holiday since 1937)
- Monuments worldwide
- "Discoverer of America" mythology

### Reappraisal

**Modern Criticism:**
- Opened era of colonialism, slavery, genocide
- Brutal governor
- Enslavement of indigenous people
- Hero worship obscures victims

**Indigenous Peoples' Day:**
Many U.S. cities/states now observe instead of or alongside Columbus Day.
