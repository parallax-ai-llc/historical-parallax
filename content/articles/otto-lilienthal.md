## Summary

Otto Lilienthal made over 2,000 successful glider flights between 1891 and 1896, becoming the first person to make repeated, well-documented, controlled flights. His systematic approach to aerodynamics and his published data directly influenced the Wright brothers. He died from injuries sustained in a glider crash, reportedly saying 'sacrifices must be made.'
