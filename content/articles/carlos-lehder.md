## Summary
Carlos Enrique Lehder Rivas was a Colombian-German drug trafficker and co-founder of the Medellín Cartel. He pioneered the use of small aircraft and a private island in the Bahamas to smuggle cocaine into the United States. He was one of the first major cartel figures extradited and convicted in the US.

## Early Life
Born September 7, 1949, in Armenia, Quindío, Colombia, to a German father and Colombian mother. He moved to the United States as a young man and was arrested for marijuana possession and car theft. In prison, he learned drug smuggling techniques from fellow inmates. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Lehder purchased Norman's Cay, a small island in the Bahamas, which he used as a transshipment point for cocaine heading to the US. He worked with Pablo Escobar and the Medellín Cartel. He moved massive quantities of cocaine using small aircraft. He was openly ideological, admiring Adolf Hitler and advocating for legalization of drugs. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Lehder was captured by Colombian police on February 4, 1987, and extradited to the United States — one of the first major cartel figures to face this fate. He was convicted in 1988 and sentenced to life plus 135 years. His sentence was later reduced for cooperating against Manuel Noriega. He was released from US prison in 2020 and deported to Germany. [^3]
