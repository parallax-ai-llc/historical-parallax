## Summary

Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) was a French military commander and emperor who dominated European affairs for over a decade (1804-1815), leading France to an empire spanning most of continental Europe. Rising from minor Corsican nobility through military brilliance during the French Revolution, Napoleon seized power in 1799 coup d'état, becoming First Consul, then Emperor (1804). His military genius—exemplified in battles like Austerlitz—revolutionized warfare. He reformed French law (Napoleonic Code), education, and administration, modernizing the state. However, his ambitions led to massive bloodshed: millions died in Napoleonic Wars. Defeated at Waterloo (1815), he was exiled to St. Helena, where he died. Napoleon remains controversial—hero or tyrant, liberator or conqueror, genius or megalomaniac.
