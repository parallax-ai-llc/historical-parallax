## Summary

Gyeongjong (born November 20, 1688; died October 11, 1724) was the 20th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning briefly from 1720 to 1724.[^1] He was the son of King Sukjong and the infamous **Jang Hui-bin**. His life was tragic from start to finish: witnessing his mother's execution by poison when he was 14, suffering from lifelong illness and infertility (rumored to be caused by his mother), and reigning as a weak king caught in the deadly crossfire between the **Noron** and **Soron** factions.[^2] His sudden death after eating marinated crabs and persimmons sparked persistent rumors that he was poisoned by his half-brother and successor, King Yeongjo.[^3]

## Early Life and Trauma

Born **Yi Yun**, he was the eagerly awaited first son of King Sukjong. However, his mother's identity as **Jang Hui-bin** (a concubine turned queen turned condemned criminal) made his position precarious.

- **Mother's Execution:** In 1701, when Sukjong ordered Jang Hui-bin to drink poison, Gyeongjong (then Crown Prince) begged for her life on his knees.
- **The Injury:** A persistent palace rumor claims that in her final moments, Jang Hui-bin pulled her son's genitals violently, cursing him to end the royal line. Whether true or not, Gyeongjong suffered from poor health and had no children.[^4]

## The Succession Crisis

When Gyeongjong ascended to the throne in 1720, the court was split.

- **Soron Faction:** Supported Gyeongjong, sympathizing with his tragic fate.
- **Noron Faction:** Viewed Gyeongjong as the son of a sinner and actively pushed for his half-brother, **Prince Yeoning** (Yeongjo), to take power.
- **Proxy Rule:** Pressured by the Noron faction, Gyeongjong was forced to appoint Prince Yeoning as "Crown Prince Brother" (Wangseje) and allow him to handle state affairs (proxy rule), virtually stripping himself of power.[^5]

## Sinim Sahwa (The Purges)

Gyeongjong's reign saw two bloody purges known as **Sinim Sahwa** (1721–1722).

- **Counterattack:** When the Noron faction overstepped by demanding Gyeongjong hand over even more power, the Soron faction struck back. They accused the Noron leaders of treason (plotting to kill the king).
- **Execution:** Gyeongjong, usually passive, sided with the Sorons. Four leaders of the Noron faction were executed, and Prince Yeoning's life hung by a thread.[^6]

## Mysterious Death

Gyeongjong died suddenly on **October 11, 1724**, after reigning only four years.

- **The Crab and Persimmon:** The night before his death, Prince Yeoning (Yeongjo) sent him a meal of seasoned raw crab (Ganjang-gejang) and persimmons. According to traditional Korean medicine, these two foods are incompatible and dangerous when eaten together (causing severe digestion issues). Gyeongjong ate them, fell ill, and died.[^7]
- **Poisoning Rumors:** This incident fueled rumors for decades that Yeongjo had poisoned his brother to seize the throne, sparking rebellions (like the **Yi In-jwa Rebellion** of 1728) that challenged Yeongjo's legitimacy.[^8]
