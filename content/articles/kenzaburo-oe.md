## Summary

Kenzaburo Oe was a Japanese novelist who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1994 for creating an imagined world 'where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today.' His novels, deeply influenced by the birth of his disabled son, explore postwar Japan's identity crisis with raw honesty.
