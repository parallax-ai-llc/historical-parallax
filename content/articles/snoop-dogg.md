## Summary

Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr., known professionally as Snoop Dogg, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, actor, media personality, and entrepreneur who emerged as one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history. Born on October 20, 1971, in Long Beach, California, Snoop rose to prominence in 1992 after being featured on Dr. Dre's debut solo single "Deep Cover" and subsequently on Dre's landmark album *The Chronic*.[^1] His 1993 debut album *Doggystyle* became the first debut album to enter the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 800,000 copies in its first week and establishing him as a West Coast hip-hop icon.[^2] Over three decades, Snoop has sold over 35 million albums worldwide, won his first Grammy Award in 2020, and expanded his influence far beyond music into business, philanthropy, and popular culture.[^3][^4]

## Early Life and Background

Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr. was born on October 20, 1971, in Long Beach, California, to Beverly Tate (1951–2021) and Vernell Varnado.[^5] His biological father, Varnado, was a Vietnam War veteran, singer, and mail carrier who left the family only three months after Snoop's birth.[^6] As a result, Calvin was named after his stepfather, Calvin Cordozar Broadus Sr. (1948–1984).[^7] His mother nicknamed him "Snoopy" due to his resemblance to and affection for the cartoon character from the Peanuts comic strip, a moniker that would eventually become his stage name.[^8]

Snoop was the second of his mother's three sons and was raised in a Baptist household.[^9] He began singing and playing piano at Golgotha Trinity Baptist Church at a very young age, showing early musical talent.[^10] Despite his religious upbringing, Snoop's adolescence was marked by challenges common to inner-city youth in Long Beach during the 1980s and early 1990s. After graduating from high school in 1989—where he met his future wife Shante Broadus and attended prom together—Snoop found himself in and out of prison for several years on drug-related charges.[^11][^12]

During this difficult period, Snoop began pursuing hip-hop more seriously, recording homemade tapes with his cousin Nate Dogg and friend Warren G under the group name 213.[^13] It was Warren G, Dr. Dre's stepbrother, who introduced Snoop to the legendary producer in 1992.[^14] Dre was immediately impressed by Snoop's surprisingly mellow flow and distinctive vocal style that didn't rely on volume to command attention.[^15] This introduction would prove to be the turning point in Snoop's life, launching one of the most successful careers in hip-hop history.

## Rise to Prominence

Snoop Dogg's ascent to stardom began with his feature on Dr. Dre's debut solo single "Deep Cover," released on April 14, 1992, as part of the *Deep Cover* soundtrack.[^16] This marked Snoop Doggy Dogg's first appearance on a record release and his first music video.[^17] The track showcased Snoop's laid-back, melodic delivery over Dre's G-funk production, a sound that would come to define West Coast hip-hop in the 1990s.[^18] Dre introduced Snoop to the world as his protégé on "Deep Cover," and the chemistry between the two artists was immediately apparent.[^19]

Following the success of "Deep Cover," Snoop became a central figure on Dr. Dre's landmark 1992 album *The Chronic*.[^20] Snoop's prominent vocals on hit singles like "Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang" and "Dre Day" fueled a rapid ascent to stardom and helped establish Death Row Records as a dominant force in the music industry.[^21] The Guardian's Rob Fitzpatrick later credited *The Chronic* and Snoop's contributions with helping introduce the G-funk genre—characterized by slow, heavy beats and melodic synthesizers—to a new generation of hip-hop fans.[^22]

Snoop's debut album *Doggystyle* was released on November 23, 1993, by Death Row and Interscope Records, with production entirely handled by Dr. Dre.[^23] The album made history by becoming the first debut record to enter the Billboard 200 chart at number one, selling an astounding 806,000 copies in its first week—a record for a debuting artist and the fastest-selling hip-hop album until Eminem's *The Marshall Mathers LP* in 2000.[^24][^25] *Doggystyle* spawned two Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles: "Who Am I? (What's My Name?)," released on November 11, 1993, and "Gin and Juice," released on January 18, 1994, both of which peaked at number eight on the charts.[^26][^27][^28] The album received quadruple platinum certification from the RIAA in May 1994 and ultimately sold over 6 million copies in the United States alone.[^29][^30]

The success of *Doggystyle* established Snoop Dogg as a household name and a defining voice of 1990s West Coast gangsta rap. Fitzpatrick noted that the album proved rappers "could reinvent themselves," while expanding rap's vocabulary, changing hip-hop fashions, and cementing G-funk as a legitimate subgenre.[^31] Fellow rappers including Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, and Maxo Kream have all cited Snoop and *Doggystyle* as major influences on their own work.[^32]

## Major Achievements and Career Milestones

### Musical Success and Album Sales

Over his three-decade career, Snoop Dogg has released numerous successful albums and sold over 35 million albums worldwide, with more than 23 million sold in the United States alone.[^33][^34] His second album, *Tha Doggfather* (1996), was released on Death Row Records and, while not matching *Doggystyle*'s commercial success, still achieved double platinum status.[^35] After leaving Death Row, Snoop signed with No Limit Records, where he released *Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told* (1998), *No Limit Top Dogg* (1999)—which sold over 1.5 million copies—and *Tha Last Meal* (2000), which sold over 2.1 million copies.[^36][^37]

Snoop's first song to reach the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart was "Drop It Like It's Hot" (2004), featuring Pharrell Williams, which spent 30 weeks on the chart with three weeks at number one.[^38] This achievement came more than a decade into his career, demonstrating his ability to remain relevant and adapt to changing musical landscapes. His musical versatility became particularly evident when he released the reggae album *Reincarnated* in 2012 under the name Snoop Lion, following a spiritual awakening and newfound understanding of Rastafarianism.[^39][^40]

Snoop has worked with a diverse array of artists throughout his career, from Pharrell Williams on "Beautiful" to Katy Perry on "California Gurls," showcasing his ability to cross genres and collaborate with mainstream pop artists while maintaining his hip-hop credibility.[^41]

### Awards and Recognition

Despite his enormous commercial success and cultural influence, Snoop Dogg went through much of his career without winning a Grammy Award. He received an impressive 17 Grammy nominations over the years before finally winning his first Grammy in 2020 for his collaboration with DJ Khaled, John Legend, and the late Nipsey Hussle on the song "Higher," which won Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Grammy Awards.[^42][^43][^44] The victory was particularly meaningful as it honored Nipsey Hussle posthumously, with all proceeds from the song going to Hussle's children.[^45]

In 2025, Time magazine named Snoop Dogg one of the 100 most influential people of the year, recognizing his continued cultural relevance decades into his career.[^46] The Washington Post, Billboard, and NME have called him a "West Coast icon," while the Press-Telegram labeled him "an icon of gangsta rap."[^47] He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time, rooted firmly in West Coast hip-hop tradition.[^48]

### Business Ventures and Entrepreneurship

In February 2022, Snoop Dogg made headlines by acquiring Death Row Records—the label that launched his career—from MNRK Music Group, which is controlled by Blackstone private equity funds.[^49] Snoop stated: "It feels good to have ownership of the label I was part of at the beginning of my career and as one of the founding members. This is an extremely meaningful moment for me."[^50] The acquisition included the Death Row brand and later the label's recording catalog, giving Snoop full control of his debut album *Doggystyle*, his second album *Tha Doggfather*, and numerous soundtracks and compilations.[^51][^52]

As of 2025, Snoop Dogg's net worth stands at an impressive $160-165 million, making him one of hip-hop's financial elite.[^53] His business empire extends far beyond music. Casa Verde Capital, his cannabis investment firm, manages over $300 million in assets.[^54] He launched Leafs by Snoop in 2015, offering premium cannabis products, and created Merry Jane, a media platform providing cannabis-related content.[^55] His investment portfolio includes early stakes in technology companies like Reddit, which achieved a $13 billion market cap during its 2023 public offering.[^56]

Snoop has secured lucrative brand partnerships with Corona, Dunkin', and Skechers, and ventured into the alcohol market with INDOGGO Gin and collaborations with 19 Crimes wine.[^57] His role as NBC's special correspondent for the 2024 Paris Olympics proved particularly lucrative, earning him $500,000 daily and a total of $10 million for the Summer Games.[^58] During the Olympics, Snoop carried the Olympic torch through the streets of Saint-Denis wearing golden trainers, later reflecting: "I felt like Muhammad Ali" and noting that "when you hold the torch, you're a peace messenger."[^59][^60]

### Acting and Media Career

Snoop Dogg has built a substantial acting career alongside his music endeavors. He appeared in notable films including *Training Day* (2001), where he played the character Blue, and enjoyed box office success as Huggy Bear in *Starsky and Hutch* (2004), for which he was paid $500,000.[^61][^62][^63] Other film credits include *Baby Boy*, *Bones*, *Old School* (2003), *Soul Plane* (2004), *Turbo* (2013), and *Pitch Perfect 2* (2015).[^64]

### Philanthropy

Snoop founded the Snoop Youth Football League (SYFL) in 2005 to provide opportunities for inner-city children to participate in youth football and cheerleading.[^65] The inaugural season saw over 1,300 kids from the Los Angeles area participate.[^66] The league has since grown to support more than 60,000 young athletes, including youth with disabilities, since its inception.[^67][^68] The program teaches teamwork, sportsmanship, discipline, and self-respect while stressing the importance of academics.[^69] The league has produced 38 Division 1 football players and one Super Bowl ring winner, while helping thousands of kids stay off the streets.[^70]

Beyond the football league, Snoop hosts annual turkey drives around Los Angeles and regularly travels to Jamaica, where the Mind Gardens project helps feed impoverished children by planting community plots.[^71]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Legal Troubles

One of the most significant legal challenges Snoop Dogg faced occurred in 1996 when he was charged with murder stemming from a drive-by shooting that resulted in the death of a rival gang member.[^72] After a lengthy legal battle, Snoop was acquitted of all charges in 1997, but the incident left a lasting impact on his public image and reinforced the gangster persona that both helped and haunted his career.[^73]

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Snoop accumulated multiple drug-related charges. He racked up three misdemeanor charges for marijuana possession: one in Los Angeles in 1998, another in Cleveland in 2001, and a third in Texas in 2010.[^74] In 1993, he was pulled over during a traffic stop and police found a gun in his car; in 1997, he pleaded guilty to handgun possession.[^75]

### Sexual Assault Allegations

In February 2022, just days before his Super Bowl Halftime Show performance, Snoop Dogg was sued by a woman (identified as Jane Doe) who accused him of violating laws on sex trafficking, sexual battery, and sexual assault.[^76] The woman alleged that the incident occurred after she attended a Snoop Dogg concert in May 2013, claiming the rap icon forced her into a sex act in a recording studio bathroom.[^77] A spokesperson for Snoop Dogg denied that the rapper had "any sexual encounter whatsoever" with the woman and called it a "shakedown scheme."[^78] The accuser later revived the lawsuit after initial proceedings.[^79]

### Political Controversies

Snoop Dogg's 2017 music video for "Lavender (Nightfall Remix)" made serious waves when the satirical clip featured a clownish stand-in for Donald Trump, dubbed "Ronald Klump," with Snoop pointing a toy gun at the character.[^80] This drew significant criticism from conservative commentators and Trump supporters.

In a seemingly contradictory move, Snoop faced intense backlash in January 2025 for performing at the Crypto Ball in Washington D.C., an event held before Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20, 2025.[^81] Fans were shocked when video surfaced showing Snoop, along with Rick Ross and Soulja Boy, performing at the event, particularly given his previous criticisms of Trump, including a 2016 post where he smoked to the anti-Trump song "FDT."[^82]

### Other Controversies

In 2025, Snoop Dogg sparked outrage after admitting on the "It's Giving" podcast that he felt "scared to go to the movies" when blindsided by a same-sex couple depicted in Pixar's 2022 film *Lightyear*.[^83] The comments drew criticism from LGBTQ advocates and allies who felt his remarks were homophobic and disappointing given his platform and influence.

A former employee filed a $107 million lawsuit in 2025, alleging she was not compensated for work tied to the relaunch of Death Row Records, though Snoop dismissed the claims as groundless.[^84]

## Personal Life

### Marriage and Family

Snoop Dogg has been married to his high school sweetheart, Shante Broadus, since June 1997.[^85] The couple first met in high school and attended prom together before graduating in 1989.[^86] While they had a brief separation in 2004, they reconciled and have remained together ever since.[^87] When asked about the secret to his long marriage, Snoop has emphasized the importance of finding out what your partner needs and maintaining open communication.[^88]

Snoop is the father of four children: sons Cordé (born 1994), Cordell (born 1997), and daughter Cori (born 1999) with wife Shante Broadus, as well as a son, Julian Corrie Broadus (born 1998), from a relationship with Laurie Holmond.[^89][^90] His children have pursued various creative and entrepreneurial paths. Cordé has a passion for music and rap, performing under the moniker Kalvin Love.[^91] Cordell played football through high school and for the UCLA Bruins before quitting the team to pursue a film career.[^92] Julian works in tech as the executive director of promotions for Voxel X Network, a company involved in NFTs and gaming.[^93] Cori sings and performs under the name Choc and is an entrepreneur who sells beauty products through her company Choc Factory.[^94]

### Extended Family and Tragedy

As of 2025, Snoop is the grandfather of seven grandchildren.[^95] Through his eldest son Cordé, he has grandchildren Zion, Leo, and Elleven, while through Cordell, he has granddaughters Cordoba, Chateau, and Symphony Sol.[^96] Tragically, Cordé had another son who died on September 25, 2019, just ten days after birth.[^97]

Snoop experienced family losses throughout his life. His mother Beverly Tate died in 2021.[^98] On February 16, 2024, Snoop's brother, Bing Worthington, died at the age of 44.[^99] Snoop is also the first cousin of AEW professional wrestler Mercedes Moné and the late rapper Nate Dogg, who died of congestive heart failure on March 15, 2011.[^100]

### Personality and Public Persona

Snoop Dogg has cultivated a distinctive public persona characterized by his laid-back demeanor, sense of humor, and authenticity. He popularized the use of "-izzle speak" in pop and hip-hop music, adding to his cultural impact beyond just his musical contributions.[^101] In recent years, he has evolved from a West Coast gangsta rapper into what some have called "Grandpa Snoop," a more family-friendly entertainer who appeals to multiple generations.[^102] His ability to reinvent himself while maintaining cultural relevance has been a key aspect of his enduring influence on hip-hop culture.[^103]

## Legacy and Cultural Impact

### Musical Influence

Snoop Dogg's contributions to hip-hop have influenced generations of artists and helped shape the genre's evolution over three decades.[^104] His collaboration with Dr. Dre played a significant role in defining the G-funk genre, with Snoop's contributions instrumental in shaping the sound of West Coast hip-hop during the 1990s.[^105] The Guardian noted that *Doggystyle* proved rappers "could reinvent themselves," expanding rap's vocabulary and changing hip-hop fashions in the process.[^106]

Fellow West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar has cited *Doggystyle* as a major influence, while ScHoolboy Q and Maxo Kream have also acknowledged Snoop's impact on their artistic development.[^107] His distinctive vocal delivery—a surprisingly mellow flow that doesn't rely on volume—became one of the most recognizable voices in hip-hop and spawned countless imitators.[^108]

### Cultural Evolution

Snoop Dogg has transcended the boundaries of hip-hop to become a symbol of resilience, creativity, and authenticity.[^109] His cultural impact is vast and multifaceted, extending far beyond music into film, television, business, and popular culture. The Washington Post, Billboard, and NME have called him a "West Coast icon," while the Press-Telegram labeled him "an icon of gangsta rap."[^110]

His role in the 1990s Los Angeles hip-hop scene helped establish the city as a major force in the genre, rivaling the East Coast's dominance.[^111] Beyond the music, Snoop became a cultural phenomenon whose influence can be seen in fashion, language, and attitudes toward cannabis culture. His evolution from gangsta rapper to mainstream entertainer and entrepreneur demonstrates the possibility of reinvention and growth within hip-hop culture.[^112]

### Lasting Relevance

What sets Snoop apart from many of his contemporaries is his ability to remain culturally relevant across multiple decades and generations. His appearance at the 2022 Super Bowl Halftime Show alongside Dr. Dre, Eminem, Mary J. Blige, and Kendrick Lamar was a full-circle moment that celebrated the legacy of West Coast hip-hop.[^113] His 2024 role as NBC's Olympic correspondent introduced him to new audiences and demonstrated his versatility as an entertainer beyond music.[^114]

Time magazine's recognition of Snoop as one of the 100 most influential people of 2025 underscores his continued impact on culture and society.[^115] He has successfully navigated the transition from controversial gangsta rapper to beloved cultural icon, business mogul, and philanthropist, all while maintaining his authenticity and connection to his Long Beach roots.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and music critics have consistently recognized Snoop Dogg's contributions to hip-hop and popular culture. Academic research examining the representation of African American culture in *Doggystyle*'s album art and music reveals how Snoop's persona both reflects and challenges stereotypes associated with African American life in the early 1990s.[^116] Researchers have noted that his work must be understood within the socio-political backdrop of Los Angeles during that era, particularly in the aftermath of the 1992 riots and ongoing tensions between Black communities and law enforcement.[^117]

The Cambridge Companion to Hip-Hop, a major academic work on the genre, dedicates significant attention to Snoop's career, with scholar Travis L. Gosa describing approximately two decades of his work.[^118] Music critics have praised Snoop's ability to create accessible, commercially successful music without sacrificing artistic integrity. His laid-back vocal style and melodic approach to rapping helped expand what was possible within gangsta rap, making the genre more palatable to mainstream audiences while maintaining street credibility.[^119]

Defenders of Snoop's legacy point to his longevity, versatility, and business acumen as evidence of his genius. His ability to collaborate with artists across genres—from hardcore rappers to pop stars—demonstrates rare adaptability.[^120] His philanthropic work, particularly the Snoop Youth Football League, shows a commitment to giving back to underserved communities and providing opportunities for young people to escape the cycle of poverty and violence that he himself experienced.[^121]

### Negative Views and Criticisms

Critics of Snoop Dogg's legacy often focus on the content of his early music and its potential negative influence. In "The Cambridge Companion to Hip-Hop," Travis L. Gosa positions Snoop as a figure who "gestures to the death of socially conscious hip-hop and the birth of the 1990s gangsta rap era."[^122] Some scholars and critics view his commercial success as representative of hip-hop's shift away from the political consciousness of groups like Public Enemy and toward a focus on violence, misogyny, and materialism.[^123]

Academic analyses have examined how "times have affected the change in themes of violence in gangsta rap lyrics," using Snoop as a case study and finding troubling patterns in the glorification of criminal behavior and the objectification of women in his early work.[^124] Gosa describes Snoop as a promoter of alcohol and pornography, though noting his 2012 spiritual awakening when he became Snoop Lion represented an attempt at personal transformation.[^125]

Feminist critics have long pointed to the misogynistic content in Snoop's lyrics and the controversial imagery on the *Doggystyle* album cover as problematic representations of women that contributed to hip-hop's gender issues.[^126] His legal troubles, including the murder trial and ongoing drug-related arrests, have been cited as examples of the destructive aspects of gangster culture that his music sometimes celebrated rather than critiqued.

More recent controversies, including his comments about LGBTQ representation in films and his performance at Trump-related events despite previous criticisms of the former president, have led some to question his consistency and principles.[^127] Critics argue that his evolution from gangster to businessman represents a hollowing out of hip-hop's radical potential in favor of capitalist success.
