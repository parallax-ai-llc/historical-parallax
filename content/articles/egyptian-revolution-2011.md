## Summary

The Egyptian Revolution of 2011 (ثورة 25 يناير / Thawrat 25 Yanāyir), also known as the January 25 Revolution, was an 18-day popular uprising that ended the nearly 30-year rule of President Hosni Mubarak. Part of the broader Arab Spring wave of pro-democracy protests across the Middle East and North Africa, the Egyptian revolution captured global attention as millions gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square demanding "bread, freedom, and social justice."[^1]

Beginning on January 25, 2011—deliberately chosen as Egypt's "National Police Day" to protest police brutality—demonstrations quickly escalated from scattered protests to a mass movement that paralyzed the country. Despite violent crackdowns that killed over 840 people, protesters refused to leave Tahrir Square until Mubarak was gone. On February 11, 2011, Vice President Omar Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned and transferred power to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF).[^2]

The revolution's aftermath proved tragically complex. After Egypt's first free presidential election brought Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi to power in 2012, a military coup led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi overthrew him in July 2013. The subsequent massacre of pro-Morsi protesters at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square killed over 800 people. By 2014, Sisi had become president, establishing a military-backed authoritarianism arguably more repressive than Mubarak's. The revolution's aspirations remain unfulfilled, but its memory endures as a moment when Egyptians dared to imagine a different future.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Mubarak Era (1981-2011)

Hosni Mubarak came to power in October 1981 following the assassination of President Anwar Sadat. For nearly three decades, he maintained authoritarian rule through:

**Political Repression:**

- Continuous "state of emergency" (1981-2012) granting police unlimited powers
- Rigged elections maintaining National Democratic Party (NDP) dominance
- Suppression of opposition parties and civil society
- Extensive surveillance and censorship[^4]

**Economic Grievances:**

- High unemployment, especially among youth (estimated 25%+ for ages 15-29)
- Rising food prices and inflation
- Extreme inequality—while Mubarak's circle enriched themselves, 40% lived on under $2/day
- Crony capitalism benefiting regime-connected elites[^5]

**Police Brutality:**

- The security services (particularly the hated State Security Investigations) operated with impunity
- Torture in detention was routine
- Extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, and forced disappearances were common[^6]

### The Case of Khaled Said

A crucial catalyst for the revolution was the June 2010 death of 28-year-old Khaled Mohamed Said. Plainclothes police beat him to death in an Alexandria internet cafe, reportedly because he had posted a video exposing police corruption. Photos of his battered corpse circulated widely, and a Facebook page "We Are All Khaled Said" (كلنا خالد سعيد), created by Google executive Wael Ghonim, attracted hundreds of thousands of followers and became a key organizing tool for the revolution.[^7]

### The Tunisian Spark

On December 17, 2010, Tunisian street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi set himself on fire to protest police harassment, triggering protests that forced President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali to flee on January 14, 2011. The Tunisian revolution proved that an Arab dictator could be overthrown by popular protest, inspiring activists across the region—including in Egypt.[^8]

## The Revolution

### January 25: Day of Rage

Egyptian activists chose January 25, 2011—National Police Day—to begin protests, deliberately challenging the security forces Egyptians most resented. Organizers used Facebook, Twitter, and other social media to coordinate demonstrations in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez, and other cities.[^9]

The initial demands focused on:

- End to police brutality
- End to the state of emergency
- Free and fair elections
- End to corruption

As crowds grew larger than expected—tens of thousands in Cairo alone—demands escalated to the fall of the regime itself.

### January 28: "Friday of Rage"

After Friday prayers on January 28, millions joined protests across Egypt. The government responded with:

- Cutting internet and mobile phone services nationwide
- Deploying riot police with tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition
- Curfew declarations (widely ignored)

Despite the crackdown, protesters overwhelmed police in Cairo and other cities. That night, the military deployed to the streets—but, crucially, soldiers did not fire on protesters. Many Egyptians embraced soldiers, chanting "The army and the people are one hand" (الجيش والشعب إيد واحدة).[^10]

### Tahrir Square: The Heart of the Revolution

Tahrir Square ("Liberation Square") in central Cairo became the revolution's symbolic center and physical headquarters:

- **Occupation:** Protesters established a continuous presence, with tents, field hospitals, and organized security
- **Diversity:** The crowds included Islamists and secularists, Muslims and Christians, workers and professionals, young and old
- **Non-Violence:** Despite provocations, protesters largely maintained non-violent discipline
- **Self-Organization:** Revolutionary committees coordinated logistics, security, media, and negotiations[^11]

### February 2: The Battle of the Camel

On February 2, pro-Mubarak thugs (many reportedly paid and later identified as police and NDP members) attacked Tahrir Square, some riding horses and camels into the crowd. The "Battle of the Camel" (موقعة الجمل) lasted hours, leaving at least 11 dead and hundreds wounded. Rather than demoralizing protesters, the attack strengthened their resolve and discredited the regime's claims of popular support.[^12]

### February 11: Mubarak Falls

As protests continued and the military signaled it would not massacre protesters, the regime finally collapsed:

- February 10: Mubarak gave a televised address refusing to resign, delegating some powers to Vice President Omar Suleiman—the crowd responded with fury
- February 11, 6:00 PM: Suleiman announced that Mubarak had resigned and transferred power to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF)

Tahrir Square erupted in celebration. Egyptians across the country took to the streets in joy. The pharaoh had fallen.[^13]

## Death Toll

**During the 18 Days (January 25 - February 11, 2011):**

- At least 846 people killed
- Over 6,000 injured
- Most deaths caused by police gunfire; many victims shot in the head or chest
- Government fact-finding commission later confirmed that security forces shot protesters deliberately[^14]

**Beyond February 11:**
Violence continued during the transitional period under SCAF, with additional casualties at:

- Maspero massacre (October 2011): 28 Coptic Christian protesters killed
- Port Said stadium riot (February 2012): 74 killed
- Mohamed Mahmoud Street clashes (2011-2012): dozens killed[^15]

## Aftermath and Counter-Revolution

### SCAF Rule (February 2011 - June 2012)

The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, led by Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, ruled Egypt during the transition:

- Suspended the constitution
- Dissolved parliament
- Promised elections and civilian rule
- Faced continued protests over slow reforms and military trials of civilians[^16]

### Morsi Presidency (June 2012 - July 2013)

In June 2012, Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi won Egypt's first free presidential election, narrowly defeating Ahmed Shafik (Mubarak's last prime minister). Morsi's presidency was marked by:

- Constitutional crisis over Islamist-drafted constitution
- Economic difficulties and continuing unrest
- Accusations of Brotherhood power grab
- Mass protests in June 2013 demanding his removal[^17]

### The 2013 Coup and Sisi's Rise

On July 3, 2013, Defense Minister General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi announced that the military had removed Morsi from office:

- Constitution suspended
- Morsi and Brotherhood leaders arrested
- Pro-Morsi protesters established sit-ins at Rabaa al-Adawiya and al-Nahda squares[^18]

### Rabaa Massacre (August 14, 2013)

On August 14, 2013, Egyptian security forces violently dispersed the Rabaa sit-in in what Human Rights Watch called "the most serious incident of mass unlawful killings in modern Egyptian history":

- At least 817 killed (possibly over 1,000)
- Mostly unarmed protesters
- Security forces used live ammunition, bulldozers, and snipers
- The four-finger "Rabaa sign" became a symbol of the Brotherhood and anti-Sisi opposition[^19]

### Sisi's Egypt (2014-Present)

Sisi was elected president in 2014 and has maintained authoritarian control:

- Muslim Brotherhood declared a terrorist organization
- Tens of thousands of political prisoners (including many 2011 activists)
- Severe press censorship
- Civil society crushed
- Many 2011 revolutionaries jailed, exiled, or silenced[^20]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views (Revolutionary Perspective)

**Breaking the Fear Barrier:** For 18 days, Egyptians proved they could overcome the fear that had sustained decades of dictatorship. The experience of collective action, solidarity across religious and class lines, and the fall of Mubarak demonstrated that change was possible.[^21]

**Democratic Moment:** Egypt held genuinely competitive elections for the first time in its modern history. Whatever followed, the revolution proved that Egyptians wanted and could achieve democratic participation.[^22]

**Inspirational Legacy:** The Egyptian revolution inspired pro-democracy movements worldwide. The images from Tahrir Square—the massive crowds, the creativity, the courage—became globally iconic symbols of popular power.[^23]

### Critical Views (Counter-Revolutionary/Realist Perspective)

**Naive About Power:** Critics argued that revolutionaries were naive about the military's interests, failed to build institutions, and allowed Islamists and the military to outmaneuver them.[^24]

**Stability Argument:** Some argued (particularly the Sisi regime and its supporters) that the revolution unleashed chaos that only military intervention could end, and that order was more important than democratic experimentation.[^25]

**Unfinished Business:** From a revolutionary perspective, the tragedy is that the goals of 2011—bread, freedom, dignity—remain unachieved under a more repressive government than before.[^26]

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Regional Impact

The Egyptian revolution was central to the Arab Spring, which also saw:

- Tunisia: Successful democratic transition
- Libya: Overthrow of Gaddafi followed by civil war
- Syria: Revolution became devastating civil war
- Yemen: Uprising led to ongoing conflict
- Bahrain: Protests crushed with Saudi assistance[^27]

### Activism and Memory

Despite repression, the memory of Tahrir remains powerful:

- Annual commemorations (often suppressed)
- Cultural production: films, novels, music remember 2011
- Diaspora activism continues
- Many 2011 activists maintain hope for eventual change[^28]

### Lessons

The Egyptian experience offers lessons about:

- The limits of social media-driven movements
- The importance of building institutions alongside protests
- The danger of military "guardianship" of democracy
- The resilience of authoritarian states[^29]
