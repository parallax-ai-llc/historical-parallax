## Summary
Richard Trenton Chase, the 'Vampire of Sacramento,' was an American serial killer who murdered six people in Sacramento, California in January 1978. He drank his victims' blood and cannibalized their remains. He believed he needed to drink blood to prevent his own from turning to powder.

## Early Life
Born May 23, 1950, in Sacramento. He exhibited early signs of severe mental illness and was institutionalized multiple times. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. He killed animals and drank their blood. He was released from a mental facility against medical advice. [^1]

## Criminal Career
In January 1978, Chase murdered six people in Sacramento over the course of a month. He entered unlocked homes — believing a locked door meant he wasn't welcome but an unlocked door was an invitation. He shot, mutilated, and cannibalized his victims. He drank their blood, believing it was necessary to prevent his blood from turning to powder. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Chase was arrested on January 27, 1978, after police traced evidence to his apartment, where they found human remains and blood. He was convicted of six first-degree murders and sentenced to death. He died by suicide from an overdose of prescribed medication on December 26, 1980, in prison. [^3]
