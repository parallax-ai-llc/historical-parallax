## Summary

Edward Witten is an American mathematical physicist who is widely regarded as one of the greatest living theoretical physicists. He is a leader in string theory and proposed M-theory, which unified the five superstring theories. He won the Fields Medal in 1990, the only physicist to do so. His work has had profound impacts on both physics and mathematics, particularly in topology and geometry.
