## Summary

Stanley Miller was an American chemist who conducted the famous Miller-Urey experiment in 1953, which demonstrated that organic compounds essential for life could be produced from simple inorganic molecules under simulated early Earth conditions. Using electric sparks to simulate lightning in a mixture of gases, he produced amino acids. This experiment was a landmark in the study of the origin of life.
