Shing-Tung Yau proved the Calabi conjecture and established the existence of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which became central to string theory in physics. He received the Fields Medal in 1982, the first person of Chinese descent to do so. His work on differential geometry and mathematical physics has profoundly influenced both mathematics and theoretical physics.
