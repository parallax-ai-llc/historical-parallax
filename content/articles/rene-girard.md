## Summary

René Girard was a French-American historian, literary critic, and philosopher whose mimetic theory profoundly influenced theology, anthropology, and social science. He argued that human desire is imitative (mimetic), leading to rivalry and scapegoating violence. He saw the Christian revelation — particularly the crucifixion — as exposing and overcoming the scapegoat mechanism. His work has inspired a major theological and interdisciplinary movement.
