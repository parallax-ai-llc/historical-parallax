## Summary

Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini was an Iranian Shia Islamic cleric, revolutionary, and political leader who founded the Islamic Republic of Iran and served as its first Supreme Leader from 1979 until his death in 1989.[^1] Born in 1902 in the small village of Khomeyn, he rose from humble origins to become one of the most influential religious and political figures of the twentieth century, leading the Iranian Revolution that overthrew Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi.[^2] His political philosophy of velayat-e faqih (guardianship of the jurist) transformed Shia Islamic thought and established a theocratic system that continues to govern Iran.[^3] Khomeini's legacy remains deeply divisive—revered as a spiritual leader in much of the Islamic world while criticized in the West as a dictator responsible for severe human rights violations.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini was born on September 24, 1902, in Khomeyn, a small town in Iran's Markazi province, though some sources cite his birth certificate date as May 17, 1900.[^5] His given name, Ruhollah, means "inspired of God" in Arabic, a name that would prove prophetic given his later religious prominence.[^6] He was born into a family of Shiite religious scholars with a lineage tracing back to the Prophet Muhammad, a prestigious genealogy that would later enhance his religious authority.[^7]

Tragedy struck early in Khomeini's life when his father, Mustafa Musawi, was murdered on the orders of a local landlord in 1903, when Khomeini was only five months old.[^8] This event left a profound impact on the young boy and may have contributed to his later opposition to injustice and tyranny. He was raised by his mother, Agha Khanum, and his aunt, Sahebeth, in the traditional religious environment of early twentieth-century Iran.[^9]

Khomeini began his religious education at an exceptionally young age, studying the Quran and elementary Persian at six years old.[^10] The following year, he attended a local school where he learned religious subjects, lamentation recital, and other traditional Islamic disciplines. In 1918, tragedy struck again when he lost both his mother and aunt, leaving him orphaned and deepening his reliance on his extended family and religious community.[^11]

After World War I, arrangements were initially made for him to study at the Islamic seminary in Isfahan, but he was instead attracted to the seminary in Arak.[^12] In 1920, he moved to Arak and commenced his studies under the leadership of Ayatollah Abdolkarim Haeri Yazdi, one of the most prominent Shia scholars of the era.[^13] When Haeri Yazdi moved to Qom in the early 1920s, Khomeini followed him, settling in what would become Iran's intellectual centre for Shiite scholarship.[^14] These formative years in Qom shaped Khomeini's religious worldview and established the foundations for his later theological and political innovations.

## Rise to Power

Khomeini's journey to political prominence began gradually in the 1940s and accelerated dramatically in the 1960s. During the 1930s and 1940s, he established himself as a prominent scholar in Qom, teaching Islamic jurisprudence, philosophy, and ethics while authoring numerous books on religious subjects.[^15] By 1944, he had grown increasingly concerned about the secularization of Iranian life under Reza Shah Pahlavi, viewing Western influence as a corrupting force on Islamic society.[^16]

The death of Grand Ayatollah Boroujerdi in 1961 created a power vacuum in Iran's religious leadership, and Khomeini began to shift his emphases from purely scholarly pursuits to more overt political activism.[^17] His decisive break with the Shah's regime came in early 1963 when Mohammad Reza Shah announced plans for the White Revolution, a series of modernization reforms that included land redistribution, women's suffrage, and educational reforms that Khomeini viewed as threatening to Islamic values.[^18]

In June 1963, Khomeini delivered a fiery speech declaring the Shah a "wretched, miserable man" who had "embarked on the path toward destruction of Islam in Iran."[^19] This denunciation inspired antigovernment riots across Iran, and Khomeini was promptly arrested, sparking further unrest. His imprisonment elevated him to national prominence as a fearless opponent of the monarchy.[^20] After a year in detention, Khomeini was released, but his continued opposition led to his re-arrest and forcible exile from Iran on November 4, 1964.[^21]

Khomeini spent the next fifteen years in exile, first in Turkey, then settling in Najaf, Iraq, where he remained until 1978.[^22] Far from diminishing his influence, exile became a period of intellectual and political development. In his famous January-February 1970 lectures to students in Najaf, Khomeini articulated his revolutionary theory of Islamic Government based on velayat-e faqih, arguing that true Islamic government must be ruled by the leading Islamic jurist.[^23] This represented a radical departure from traditional Shiite political thought, which had generally avoided direct involvement in government.

Throughout the 1970s, as public dissatisfaction with the Shah's regime mounted, Khomeini's influence inside Iran grew dramatically.[^24] Thousands of tape recordings and printed copies of his speeches were smuggled back into Iran, creating a network of underground support.[^25] When Iraq's ruler Saddam Hussein forced Khomeini to leave Iraq on October 6, 1978, he relocated to Neauphle-le-Château, a suburb of Paris.[^26] From France, his messages reached an increasingly aroused Iranian populace through modern communications technology, fueling massive demonstrations, strikes, and civil unrest that ultimately forced the Shah to flee Iran on January 16, 1979.[^27]

On February 1, 1979, Khomeini returned to Iran in triumph, greeted by crowds exceeding one million people.[^28] Ten days later, Iran's armed forces declared their neutrality, effectively ending the Shah's regime and completing the revolution.[^29] In March 1979, a referendum established the Islamic Republic of Iran, and Khomeini became its Supreme Leader, a position enshrining his political philosophy into the constitutional structure of the state.[^30]

## Major Achievements

Khomeini's most significant achievement was successfully leading the Iranian Revolution and establishing the Islamic Republic of Iran, fundamentally transforming one of the Middle East's most strategically important nations.[^31] This revolution represented one of the most significant geopolitical events of the late twentieth century, placing Iran at the forefront of Middle East politics and inspiring Islamic revival movements worldwide.[^32]

The establishment of velayat-e faqih as the governing principle of the Iranian state represented a revolutionary innovation in Shiite political thought.[^33] Prior to Khomeini, Shiite scholars had generally maintained political quietism, believing that legitimate Islamic government could only exist under the Hidden Imam who would return at the end of times. Khomeini's theory overturned this centuries-old tradition, arguing that senior religious jurists had the authority and obligation to govern in the Imam's absence.[^34] This concept was enshrined in the 1979 Constitution, which was adopted by national referendum in November of that year, making Khomeini the first Supreme Leader with ultimate authority over all state institutions.[^35]

Under Khomeini's leadership, Iran underwent massive social and political transformation. The new Islamic Republic implemented comprehensive Islamization of laws, education, and social practices, reversing many of the Shah's Westernizing reforms.[^36] Islamic law became the basis of the legal system, women were required to observe Islamic dress codes, and religious education was integrated throughout the educational system.[^37] While controversial, these changes represented the fulfillment of Khomeini's vision for an authentically Islamic society governed according to Sharia principles.

Khomeini successfully consolidated power against diverse opposition groups, including secular nationalists, leftist organizations, and rival religious factions.[^38] He skillfully navigated the complex political landscape of post-revolutionary Iran, ultimately establishing the dominance of the clerical faction loyal to his vision of Islamic government. His ability to maintain authority during this turbulent period demonstrated considerable political acumen and organizational skill.[^39]

The Islamic Republic survived the devastating Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), though Khomeini's decision to continue the war for several years after Iraq offered peace terms proved costly.[^40] Despite facing a well-equipped Iraqi military backed by Western powers and Arab states, Iran maintained its territorial integrity and revolutionary government. Khomeini framed the war as defense of the Islamic Revolution against foreign aggression, using the conflict to mobilize popular support and suppress internal dissent.[^41]

Khomeini's influence extended far beyond Iran's borders. His revolution inspired Islamic movements across the Muslim world, particularly among Shia populations in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Persian Gulf states.[^42] The establishment of the Islamic Republic demonstrated that an Islamic government based on religious law was possible in the modern world, energizing Islamist movements from Morocco to Indonesia.[^43] His anti-Western and anti-imperialist rhetoric resonated with Muslims frustrated by Western domination and secular nationalist failures, making him a symbolic figure of Islamic resistance.[^44]

As an author and religious scholar, Khomeini produced more than forty books on Islamic philosophy, law, and ethics.[^45] His writings on Islamic jurisprudence, mysticism, and political theory continue to be studied and debated. His status as a marja' (source of emulation)—one of the highest ranks in Shiite religious hierarchy—gave him spiritual authority over millions of Shiite Muslims worldwide who followed his religious rulings.[^46]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Khomeini's rule was marked by severe controversies and widespread human rights violations that have drawn extensive international criticism. The most notorious atrocity was the 1988 mass execution of thousands of political prisoners, carried out on Khomeini's direct orders.[^47] In summer 1988, Khomeini issued an order to judicial officials to judge every Iranian political prisoner and execute those deemed to be apostates from Islam or "waging war on God."[^48] Estimates of those killed range from 1,000 to 30,000, with most scholars placing the figure between 4,000 and 5,000.[^49] In 2024, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Iran categorized these purges, along with earlier massacres in 1981-1982, as genocide against Iran's political and religious minorities.[^50]

The broader pattern of executions under Khomeini's rule was staggering. More than 7,900 people were executed from 1981-1985 alone, with Amnesty International reporting that during certain periods, the number of executions in Iran exceeded those in the rest of the world combined.[^51] These executions targeted a wide range of groups including political opponents, ethnic minorities, homosexuals, and those accused of crimes against Islam such as apostasy, adultery, and drug trafficking.[^52]

The Islamic Republic systematically persecuted religious minorities, particularly the Baha'i community. Since 1978, 221 Iranian Baha'is were executed, "disappeared," or killed for their beliefs, which the regime considered heretical.[^53] Baha'is faced comprehensive discrimination including denial of education, employment, and property rights, as well as destruction of holy sites and cemeteries.[^54] Other religious minorities including Sunni Muslims, Christians, and Jews also faced varying degrees of persecution and second-class status.[^55]

Khomeini's use of child soldiers during the Iran-Iraq War drew international condemnation.[^56] Iran extensively used young members of its Basij militia, including teenagers and even children as young as twelve, in human wave attacks and to clear minefields ahead of regular troops.[^57] These tactics resulted in tens of thousands of young casualties, with many families encouraged to send their sons to martyrdom through religious propaganda and social pressure.[^58]

The suppression of women's rights represented another major criticism of Khomeini's rule. Within months of the revolution, Khomeini reversed many advances in women's legal status, imposing mandatory hijab, lowering the marriage age for girls to nine (later raised to thirteen), restricting women's access to certain professions, and implementing discriminatory laws regarding divorce, child custody, and inheritance.[^59] Women who protested these restrictions faced arrest and violence.[^60]

Khomeini's issuance of a fatwa against author Salman Rushdie in February 1989 for his novel "The Satanic Verses" demonstrated his willingness to extend Iran's religious authority globally.[^61] The death sentence against Rushdie, along with a bounty offered for his assassination, provoked an international crisis and led to attacks on translators and publishers associated with the book.[^62] This incident exemplified the regime's intolerance of perceived blasphemy and its disregard for international norms of freedom of expression.[^63]

Critics also highlight Khomeini's broken promises. Before taking power, he expressed support for democracy, human rights, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, claiming he had no desire to personally rule and that clerics would return to their seminaries after the revolution.[^64] These promises proved false as Khomeini established himself as absolute ruler and implemented authoritarian control over all aspects of Iranian society.[^65] Any disagreement with Khomeini, his regime, or their policies became equated with opposing God and His Prophet, making dissent tantamount to apostasy.[^66]

The economic consequences of Khomeini's policies also drew criticism. The revolution and subsequent war devastated Iran's economy, while the regime's anti-Western stance led to international isolation and sanctions that impoverished the population.[^67] Khomeini's prioritization of ideological purity over economic development resulted in declining living standards for ordinary Iranians despite the country's vast oil wealth.[^68]

---

## Personal Life

Khomeini's personal life was characterized by austerity, discipline, and deep religiosity. In his early twenties, he married Khadijeh Saqafi, the daughter of a respected cleric, with whom he had seven children—though only five survived to adulthood.[^69] His family life remained largely private, with Khomeini maintaining strict separation between his domestic sphere and public role.[^70] His wife Khadijeh was known for her piety and traditional lifestyle, rarely appearing in public and supporting her husband's religious and political mission.[^71]

Despite his fearsome public image, those close to Khomeini described him as gentle and affectionate with family members, particularly his grandchildren.[^72] He enjoyed Persian poetry, particularly the works of the medieval mystic poet Hafez, and reportedly wrote his own poetry under the pen name "Hindi" in his younger years.[^73] This appreciation for Persian literary culture stood somewhat in tension with his revolutionary ideology's emphasis on Islamic identity over Iranian nationalism.[^74]

Khomeini maintained an extremely disciplined daily routine centered on prayer, study, and writing. He slept little, typically rising before dawn for prayers and devoting many hours to reading, writing religious texts, and meeting with students and advisors.[^75] His lifestyle remained ascetic even after becoming Supreme Leader, living modestly and eschewing the luxuries available to him.[^76] This personal austerity enhanced his credibility among followers who saw him as embodying Islamic virtues of simplicity and detachment from worldly pleasures.[^77]

His relationship with his son Ahmad Khomeini was particularly significant, as Ahmad served as his father's closest aide and confidant, managing access to the Supreme Leader and helping to articulate his positions.[^78] Ahmad's sudden death in 1995, six years after his father, sparked conspiracy theories about foul play, though official sources attributed it to a heart attack.[^79]

Khomeini's personality combined mystical spirituality with political ruthlessness. He was known for his penetrating gaze, which many found intimidating, and his ability to remain emotionally detached when ordering executions or making difficult political decisions.[^80] This combination of religious charisma and political calculation made him a formidable leader capable of inspiring devotion while crushing opposition.[^81]

In his later years, Khomeini's health declined, though he continued to maintain his public role and authority until shortly before his death.[^82] He suffered from various ailments including heart disease and cancer, eventually undergoing surgery for internal bleeding in May 1989.[^83] On June 3, 1989, after suffering five heart attacks in ten days, Khomeini died at age 86 (or 89, depending on the birth date accepted).[^84]

His funeral became one of the largest gatherings in history, with more than ten million people from across Iran converging on Tehran to mourn their leader.[^85] The outpouring of grief was so intense that his body had to be retrieved by helicopter when mourners overwhelmed his funeral procession, tearing at his burial shroud and coffin in their desire to touch him one final time.[^86] This extraordinary display demonstrated the profound emotional connection many Iranians felt toward Khomeini, viewing him as not merely a political leader but a spiritual father and savior of the nation.[^87]

## Legacy

Khomeini's legacy remains one of the most contested and significant of the twentieth century, with his impact continuing to shape Iran and the broader Middle East decades after his death. Within Iran, politics are "largely defined by attempts to claim Khomeini's legacy," with staying faithful to his ideology serving as "the litmus test for all political activity."[^88] His vision of Islamic government continues to structure the Iranian state through the Constitution he helped draft, with the position of Supreme Leader maintaining ultimate authority over elected institutions.[^89]

The Islamic Republic he founded has proven remarkably durable, surviving internal challenges, international isolation, economic crises, and military conflicts for over four decades.[^90] This longevity stands in contrast to many revolutionary regimes and demonstrates the effectiveness of the institutional structures Khomeini established. The Revolutionary Guards, the Basij militia, the Guardian Council, and other bodies he created continue to maintain the system against both internal and external threats.[^91]

Khomeini's influence on global Islam has been profound and enduring. The Iranian Revolution demonstrated that Islamic government was achievable in the modern world, inspiring Islamist movements across the Muslim world from Hezbollah in Lebanon to various groups in Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa.[^92] His anti-Western and anti-imperialist rhetoric provided an Islamic alternative to both capitalism and communism, appealing to Muslims frustrated with secular nationalism and Western domination.[^93]

The concept of velayat-e faqih, while rejected by many Sunni Muslims and even some Shiites, fundamentally transformed Shiite political thought and practice.[^94] Khomeini's elevation of political activism over traditional quietism inspired Shiite communities worldwide to engage more directly in political struggle, particularly in Iraq, Lebanon, Bahrain, and parts of South Asia.[^95] This political awakening of Shiism remains one of his most significant legacies beyond Iran's borders.[^96]

Perhaps one of Khomeini's most controversial legacies is the broader definition of martyrdom to include istishhad or "self-martyrdom," where death results not from inadvertent circumstances but from deliberate sacrifice.[^97] This concept has influenced militant groups beyond Iran and contributed to the normalization of suicide attacks as a tactic, though Khomeini himself never explicitly endorsed suicide bombing in the manner later adopted by some groups.[^98]

In the non-Muslim world, particularly in the West, Khomeini "became the virtual face of Islam," profoundly shaping Western perceptions in ways that "inculcated fear and distrust towards Islam."[^99] The hostage crisis at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran (which occurred with Khomeini's approval), the Rushdie fatwa, and the revolutionary rhetoric against the "Great Satan" America created an image of Islam as fundamentally hostile to Western values.[^100] This legacy complicated relations between Muslim communities and Western societies and contributed to the rise of Islamophobia.[^101]

Economically, Khomeini's legacy is more ambiguous. While he successfully nationalized Iran's resources and reduced dependence on Western powers, his policies also led to international isolation, economic sanctions, and missed opportunities for development.[^102] The revolutionary ideology's emphasis on self-sufficiency and resistance to global economic integration has left Iran economically weaker than its potential would suggest, though supporters argue this preserved the country's independence and Islamic character.[^103]

Within Iranian society, Khomeini's legacy is deeply divisive across generational and class lines. Many older Iranians who experienced the revolution maintain devotion to his memory, viewing him as the liberator who freed Iran from monarchical tyranny and Western domination.[^104] However, younger Iranians, particularly those born after the revolution, often express frustration with the restrictions and economic difficulties associated with the system he created.[^105] This generational divide represents one of the Islamic Republic's ongoing challenges in maintaining legitimacy.[^106]

Khomeini's intellectual legacy includes numerous books and speeches that continue to be studied, debated, and reinterpreted. His works on Islamic jurisprudence, philosophy, mysticism, and political theory remain influential in seminaries and among religious scholars.[^107] The ongoing debates over how to interpret his writings and apply his principles to contemporary challenges reflect the complexity and occasionally contradictory nature of his thought.[^108]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Khomeini view him as one of the most significant revolutionary leaders of the twentieth century, comparable in historical impact to Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Fidel Castro.[^109] Scholars who take this perspective emphasize that the Iranian Revolution "quite literally shook the world" and seriously affected both the personal lives of Iranians and the trajectory of global politics.[^110] By all available standards, they argue, Khomeini was "a giant of the twentieth century" whose influence extended far beyond Iran's borders.[^111]

Academic defenders of Khomeini's legacy highlight his role in ending the oppressive monarchy of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, which had become increasingly autocratic, corrupt, and dependent on American support.[^112] They argue that Khomeini gave voice to millions of Iranians who felt alienated by rapid, forced Westernization that disregarded Islamic values and Iranian cultural traditions.[^113] His revolution represented genuine popular uprising rather than a military coup, with mass participation across different social classes united by opposition to the Shah's regime.[^114]

Religious scholars who admire Khomeini emphasize his intellectual contributions to Islamic thought, particularly his innovative development of velayat-e faqih as a comprehensive theory of Islamic governance.[^115] They argue that he successfully demonstrated how Islamic principles could be applied to modern governance, creating institutions that combined democratic elements (elected parliament and president) with Islamic guardianship (Supreme Leader and Guardian Council).[^116] This synthesis, supporters contend, offers a genuine alternative to both Western secular democracy and traditional monarchy.[^117]

Twenty years after his death, and continuing today, Khomeini is revered as a spiritual and political figurehead in Iran and large swathes of the Islamic world.[^118] Millions of Shiite Muslims worldwide continue to view him as a marja' whose religious rulings carry authority, and his shrine in Tehran attracts hundreds of thousands of pilgrims annually.[^119] For these devotees, Khomeini represents authentic Islamic leadership uncorrupted by worldly ambitions or Western influence.[^120]

Sympathetic historians emphasize Khomeini's personal integrity, ascetic lifestyle, and refusal to enrich himself or his family through political power.[^121] Unlike many revolutionary leaders, he maintained the modest lifestyle of a religious scholar even as Supreme Leader, lending credibility to his claims of serving Islamic principles rather than personal interests.[^122] This personal austerity continues to be cited by supporters as evidence of his sincere religious motivation.[^123]

Some scholars credit Khomeini with successfully resisting Western imperialism and maintaining Iranian independence against tremendous external pressure.[^124] The Islamic Republic's survival despite decades of sanctions, military threats, and attempts at regime change is presented as vindication of Khomeini's vision of self-reliance and resistance to foreign domination.[^125] From this perspective, Iran's regional influence and scientific advancement despite isolation demonstrates the viability of his anti-hegemonic ideology.[^126]

In the context of anti-colonial struggles, some Third World intellectuals have praised Khomeini for providing an indigenous, non-Western framework for resistance to imperialism.[^127] His success in overthrowing a Western-backed dictator inspired other movements seeking to challenge Western dominance through recourse to religious and cultural authenticity rather than imported secular ideologies.[^128]

### Negative Views

Critics and opponents of Khomeini view him as a ruthless dictator whose legacy is defined by authoritarianism, human rights abuses, and the imposition of a repressive theocracy.[^129] Western scholars and human rights organizations emphasize the systematic violations of fundamental freedoms under his rule, including mass executions, torture, suppression of dissent, and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities.[^130] They argue that any positive achievements of his revolution are vastly outweighed by the suffering inflicted on the Iranian people.[^131]

Many historians characterize Khomeini as having betrayed the promises of the revolution, which initially attracted diverse groups including democrats, leftists, and moderate Muslims who believed in pluralism and human rights.[^132] His consolidation of absolute power and elimination of all opposition represented, from this perspective, a classic revolutionary trajectory where idealistic beginnings give way to totalitarian control.[^133] The Islamic Republic's suppression of the very groups who helped bring it to power demonstrates, critics argue, that Khomeini prioritized power over principles.[^134]

Secular Iranian intellectuals and exiles are among Khomeini's harshest critics, viewing him as having destroyed Iran's progress toward modernity and democracy.[^135] They point out that pre-revolutionary Iran, despite the Shah's authoritarianism, had achieved significant advancement in education, women's rights, economic development, and cultural production—all of which suffered under the Islamic Republic.[^136] The brain drain of educated Iranians fleeing the country, including scientists, artists, and professionals, represents a tremendous loss attributed to Khomeini's regime.[^137]

Feminist scholars strongly criticize Khomeini's legacy regarding women's rights, noting that he reversed decades of progress and imposed mandatory hijab, discriminatory family laws, and restrictions on women's participation in public life.[^138] His statements about women's primary role being motherhood and his implementation of gender segregation are seen as fundamentally incompatible with gender equality and human dignity.[^139] The ongoing struggles of Iranian women against these restrictions demonstrate, critics argue, the oppressive nature of his vision.[^140]

International relations scholars often characterize Khomeini's foreign policy as destabilizing and dangerous, pointing to support for militant groups, the export of revolution, hostage-taking, and the Rushdie fatwa as violations of international norms.[^141] His "neither East nor West" slogan and confrontational stance toward both superpowers during the Cold War isolated Iran and contributed to regional instability.[^142] The eight-year war with Iraq, which killed hundreds of thousands and devastated both countries' economies, is frequently cited as a disastrous consequence of his uncompromising ideology.[^143]

Human rights organizations document extensive abuses under Khomeini's rule, including the 1988 mass executions which many scholars and the UN Special Rapporteur have characterized as genocide or crimes against humanity.[^144] Amnesty International and other watchdogs consistently rated Iran under Khomeini as one of the world's worst violators of human rights, with systematic use of torture, execution without due process, and punishment of non-violent offenses including consensual sexual conduct and religious belief.[^145]

Economic critics emphasize the decline in living standards, unemployment, inflation, and economic mismanagement that characterized Khomeini's rule.[^146] Despite Iran's vast oil wealth, ordinary Iranians became poorer due to war, corruption, ideological priorities overriding economic rationality, and international isolation resulting from the regime's policies.[^147] The squandering of Iran's economic potential is presented as one of Khomeini's most significant failures.[^148]

Religious critics, including many Muslim scholars, reject Khomeini's interpretation of Islam as excessively political, violent, and contrary to authentic Islamic teachings.[^149] Sunni Muslims generally reject velayat-e faqih as alien to Islamic tradition, while many Shiite scholars opposed Khomeini's claim that clerics should exercise political power.[^150] His use of religion to justify political repression is seen as corrupting Islam's spiritual message and contributing to negative perceptions of the faith worldwide.[^151]
