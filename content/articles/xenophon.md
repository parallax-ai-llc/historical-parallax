## Summary

Xenophon of Athens (c. 430-354 BCE) was a Greek historian, philosopher, soldier, and student of Socrates whose numerous surviving works provide invaluable insights into late Classical Greece.[^1] Best known for his *Anabasis*, which chronicles the legendary retreat of the Ten Thousand Greek mercenaries from deep within the Persian Empire, Xenophon was also a prolific author of Socratic dialogues, historical works, and practical treatises.[^2] Despite his Athenian origins, he became closely associated with Sparta and was exiled from Athens for fighting alongside Spartan forces.[^3] His writings profoundly influenced military leaders including Alexander the Great and shaped political philosophy for centuries.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Xenophon was born around 430 BCE in the deme of Erchia in Attica, Greece, into an aristocratic Athenian family.[^5] His father, named Gryllus, belonged to the wealthy upper class, which afforded young Xenophon the education and military training typical of elite Athenian youth.[^6] Growing up during the tumultuous final years of the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta, Xenophon would have witnessed the political instability and intellectual ferment that characterized Athens in this period.[^7]

As a young man of privilege, Xenophon likely served in the Athenian cavalry, which was restricted to citizens wealthy enough to maintain horses and equipment.[^8] This early military experience would prove formative, later informing his detailed treatises on horsemanship and cavalry command.[^9] During his youth, Xenophon became associated with the philosophical circle surrounding Socrates, the enigmatic Athenian philosopher who questioned conventional wisdom and engaged elite young men in dialectical examination.[^10]

According to a famous anecdote preserved in ancient sources, Socrates encountered Xenophon in a narrow lane, blocked his path with his walking stick, and asked him where various necessities could be purchased.[^11] When Xenophon answered, Socrates then asked where men could become good and virtuous, and when the young man hesitated, Socrates invited him to follow and learn.[^12] This meeting initiated Xenophon's philosophical education under one of antiquity's most influential thinkers, an association that would shape his intellectual development and provide material for his later Socratic writings.[^13]

Xenophon's early education combined the traditional aristocratic pursuits of athletics, military training, and horsemanship with the new intellectual currents represented by Socrates and the sophists.[^14] This dual foundation in both practical and theoretical knowledge became a hallmark of his later writings, which skillfully combined philosophical reflection with practical advice on subjects ranging from estate management to military tactics.[^15] Unlike his contemporary Plato, who came from an even more distinguished aristocratic background, Xenophon would pursue an active life of military adventure rather than remaining in Athens as a philosopher.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Xenophon's rise to prominence began dramatically in 401 BCE when, as a young man of about thirty, he accepted an invitation to join a military expedition to Persia.[^17] The Persian prince Cyrus the Younger, brother of King Artaxerxes II, was assembling an army including approximately 10,000 Greek mercenaries to challenge his brother for the Persian throne.[^18] According to Xenophon's own account, he consulted Socrates about whether to accept the invitation.[^19] Socrates, recognizing the political sensitivity of joining a Persian expedition while Athens maintained delicate relations with Persia, advised him to consult the oracle at Delphi.[^20]

However, Xenophon asked the oracle not whether he should go, but rather to which gods he should pray for success on the journey—effectively deciding the matter before seeking divine guidance.[^21] When he reported this to Socrates, the philosopher chastised him for posing such a disingenuous question, but Xenophon departed for Asia Minor nonetheless.[^22] This episode reveals both Xenophon's independent streak and his tendency toward decisive action over prolonged deliberation.[^23]

The expedition departed Sardis on May 20, 401 BCE, marching deep into Persian territory.[^24] On September 3, 401 BCE, the decisive Battle of Cunaxa was fought approximately 70 kilometers north of Babylon.[^25] Although the Greek mercenaries under the Spartan general Clearchus achieved tactical success on their wing of the battle, Cyrus himself was killed in a cavalry charge against his brother's bodyguard.[^26] With their employer dead and stranded over a thousand miles from Greece in hostile territory, the Greek mercenaries faced disaster.[^27]

The crisis deepened when the Persian satrap Tissaphernes treacherously murdered Clearchus and the other senior Greek officers during negotiations.[^28] Leaderless and surrounded by enemies, the Ten Thousand elected new commanders, including Xenophon, who emerged as one of the expedition's leaders despite having joined as a gentleman volunteer without official military rank.[^29] His eloquent speeches rallied the demoralized troops and his strategic thinking helped navigate the numerous challenges ahead.[^30]

Xenophon's leadership during the subsequent retreat through hostile territories—crossing mountains, rivers, and fighting off local tribes while enduring harsh weather and dwindling supplies—demonstrated his exceptional military abilities and cool judgment under pressure.[^31] The famous moment when Greek soldiers reached the Black Sea and cried "Thalatta! Thalatta!" (The sea! The sea!) marked a turning point, though considerable dangers remained before reaching Greek territories.[^32] Of the approximately 10,000 soldiers who began the retreat, roughly three-quarters survived to return home, a remarkable achievement given the circumstances.[^33]

## Major Achievements

Xenophon's achievements span military leadership, historical documentation, philosophical writing, and lasting cultural influence. His successful leadership of the Ten Thousand's retreat from Persia stands as one of the most remarkable military achievements of ancient warfare.[^34] Conducting a fighting retreat across approximately 1,500 miles of hostile territory with minimal losses required not only tactical brilliance but also the ability to maintain discipline and morale among mercenaries who had no legal obligation to continue following orders.[^35]

His literary output was both voluminous and remarkably diverse. The *Anabasis* (The March Up-Country), his firsthand account of the Persian expedition, became an immediate classic and has remained continuously in print for over two millennia.[^36] Written in clear, straightforward prose that contrasted with the complex style of his predecessor Thucydides, the *Anabasis* provided not only a gripping narrative but also practical intelligence about Persian geography, military capabilities, and logistics that would prove invaluable to later Greek commanders.[^37]

Alexander the Great reportedly used the *Anabasis* as a field guide during the early phases of his own invasion of the Persian Empire three generations later.[^38] The ancient historian Eunapius wrote that "Alexander the Great would not have become great if there had been no Xenophon," recognizing the inspirational and practical value of Xenophon's work.[^39] Indeed, Xenophon's demonstration that a relatively small Greek force could defeat Persian armies many times its size and operate successfully deep in Persian territory helped inspire Philip of Macedon and Alexander to believe that conquering the Persian Empire was feasible.[^40]

Beyond the *Anabasis*, Xenophon produced the *Hellenica*, a history of Greece covering the period from 411 to 362 BCE.[^41] This work deliberately continued the narrative where Thucydides' unfinished *History of the Peloponnesian War* ended, even beginning with the phrase "Following these events..."[^42] The *Hellenica* provides detailed coverage of Sparta's brief hegemony over Greece, the rise of Thebes, and the complex diplomatic and military maneuvering that characterized the period.[^43]

The *Cyropaedia* (The Education of Cyrus), a partly fictional biography of Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire, became perhaps Xenophon's most influential work in later European history.[^44] Though presented as a historical biography, the work functioned primarily as a philosophical treatise on ideal leadership and governance.[^45] During the Renaissance and early modern period, the *Cyropaedia* served as a foundational text in the "mirrors for princes" genre of political advice literature.[^46] Machiavelli's *The Prince*, which revolutionized European political thought, was strongly influenced by Xenophon's *Cyropaedia*, though Machiavelli ultimately rejected many of its idealistic premises.[^47]

Xenophon's Socratic writings—the *Memorabilia*, *Symposium*, *Oeconomicus*, and *Apology*—preserved invaluable accounts of Socrates' teachings and personality.[^48] While Plato's dialogues have received more scholarly attention, Xenophon's works provide an alternative perspective on the historical Socrates and may in some respects more accurately represent the actual views of the philosopher.[^49] The *Oeconomicus*, a dialogue on household and estate management, influenced agricultural and economic thought for centuries and provided unique insights into Greek domestic life.[^50]

His shorter technical works on subjects including horsemanship, cavalry command, hunting, and revenue collection demonstrated his versatility and practical knowledge.[^51] These treatises remained authoritative texts for centuries and provide modern scholars with detailed information about ancient Greek practices in these areas.[^52] His *Constitution of the Lacedaemonians* offers a systematic account of Spartan society and institutions, much of what is known today about Sparta comes from this work and his biography of King Agesilaus.[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Xenophon's career and writings generated significant controversies both in his own time and among modern scholars. His decision to fight for Sparta against Athens resulted in his exile from his native city, a punishment reflecting the seriousness of his offense.[^54] For an Athenian aristocrat to serve as an officer in Sparta's army during the conflicts following the Peloponnesian War constituted not merely disloyalty but active treason in the eyes of many Athenians.[^55]

Modern historians have criticized Xenophon's reliability as a historian, particularly in the *Hellenica* and *Agesilaus*.[^56] His pro-Spartan bias is evident throughout his historical works, often leading him to overlook or minimize Spartan failures while emphasizing their virtues.[^57] Scholarly analysis reveals that "Xenophon's deviations from truthfulness and omissions are intended to reinforce Agesilaos' positive image and promote Spartan political interests."[^58] His biography of Agesilaus frequently glosses over the Spartan king's strategic and political failures, presenting a sanitized portrayal that serves propagandistic purposes.[^59]

The political philosophy embedded in the *Cyropaedia* remains deeply controversial among scholars. Following Leo Strauss, some interpreters argue that the work contains a subtle critique of monarchy and Persian imperial practices disguised beneath surface-level praise.[^60] According to this reading, Cyrus is portrayed with troubling characteristics including arrogance, questionable judgment, and concerning sensual tendencies that undermine the ostensibly positive portrayal.[^61] Other scholars reject this esoteric interpretation, viewing the work at face value as an earnest exploration of ideal leadership.[^62]

Xenophon's standing as a philosopher has been questioned since antiquity. Cicero famously described his prose as flowing like honey but implied he lacked the intellectual depth of Plato.[^63] The nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed a severe decline in Xenophon's philosophical reputation as academic philosophy became increasingly professionalized and specialized.[^64] Modern analytic philosophers dismissed Xenophon as "a poor man's Plato, intellectually incapable of anything more than biography."[^65] His practical, common-sense approach to philosophical questions seemed unsophisticated compared to Plato's metaphysical and epistemological innovations.[^66]

The breadth of Xenophon's literary output, spanning history, philosophy, biography, technical manuals, and fiction, led to the charge that he was "a jack of all trades, a master of none."[^67] Critics argued that his refusal to specialize in any single genre or discipline prevented him from achieving true excellence.[^68] His prose style, while praised for clarity, was deemed simple and lacking the stylistic sophistication of Thucydides or the dialectical complexity of Plato.[^69]

Xenophon's treatment of Socrates has generated particular controversy. Since the early twentieth century, scholars have overwhelmingly privileged Plato's account of Socrates while dismissing Xenophon's portrayal as unreliable or unsophisticated.[^70] The so-called "Socratic Problem"—determining what the historical Socrates actually taught and believed—has largely been resolved in Plato's favor, with Xenophon's Socratic writings treated as secondary sources at best.[^71] Critics argue that Xenophon's Socrates appears too conventional, moralistic, and practically-minded compared to the radical philosophical innovator portrayed in Plato's dialogues.[^72]

---

## Personal Life

Xenophon married a woman named Philesia, though ancient sources preserve little information about her beyond her name.[^73] The scarcity of detail about Philesia reflects both ancient historians' general lack of interest in women's lives and Xenophon's own reticence about personal matters in his writings.[^74] Together they had two sons, Gryllus and Diodorus, both born on Xenophon's estate and raised according to the rigorous Spartan educational system known as the agoge.[^75]

The decision to educate his sons in the Spartan manner rather than the Athenian system reflected Xenophon's deep admiration for Spartan culture and his alienation from Athens following his exile.[^76] This choice would have given his sons training in the austere military discipline, endurance, and martial skills that characterized Spartan education, quite different from the rhetorical and philosophical emphasis of Athenian schooling.[^77]

Tragedy struck the family when Gryllus was killed at the Battle of Mantinea in 362 BCE, fighting for Athens against Thebes.[^78] According to ancient accounts, Xenophon received the news while performing a sacrifice, and though grief-stricken, he maintained his composure and finished the ritual before removing his ceremonial wreath in mourning.[^79] The Athenians, moved by his loss, revoked Xenophon's banishment in honor of his son's sacrifice, though no evidence suggests he ever returned to Athens.[^80]

After his military service with Sparta, Xenophon was granted an estate at Scillus in Elis, near Olympia, as a reward for his service.[^81] The next twenty-three years spent at Scillus appear to have been the most peaceful and productive period of his life.[^82] Wealthy enough to purchase land for a temple dedicated to Artemis and to fund annual festivals including communal feasts and hunting expeditions, Xenophon lived the life of a country gentleman.[^83] He wrote most of his major works during this period, including the *Anabasis*, his Socratic dialogues, and other treatises.[^84]

The estate at Scillus provided Xenophon with the leisure and resources to pursue his literary ambitions while engaging in the hunting and agricultural pursuits he clearly enjoyed.[^85] His *On Hunting* reflects genuine enthusiasm for the sport, which he viewed as excellent training for both military service and character development.[^86] The pastoral setting also allowed him to practice the estate management principles he articulated in the *Oeconomicus*.[^87]

This comfortable existence ended abruptly in 371 BCE following Sparta's catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Leuctra, which shattered Spartan military hegemony.[^88] The Elians, freed from Spartan dominance, confiscated Xenophon's estate, forcing him to relocate to Corinth where he spent his final years.[^89] He died around 354 BCE, shortly before his seventy-sixth birthday, having witnessed the dramatic transformation of the Greek political landscape from Spartan to Theban to eventual Macedonian domination.[^90]

## Legacy

Xenophon's legacy extends across military history, literature, philosophy, and political thought, influencing generations of soldiers, writers, and statesmen for over two millennia. The immediate and enduring popularity of the *Anabasis* established adventure narrative as a literary genre and inspired countless subsequent military memoirs and accounts of exploration.[^91] The work's influence on Alexander the Great and his strategic planning demonstrates its practical military value beyond its literary merits.[^92]

In military education, Xenophon's writings on cavalry tactics, battlefield leadership, and logistics remained authoritative texts through the Roman period and beyond.[^93] The military historian Dodge proclaimed Xenophon "the greatest general up to the time of Alexander the Great," recognizing his tactical innovations including documented use of flanking maneuvers and feints.[^94] His clear explanations of military principles made his works accessible to both practitioners and theorists of warfare.[^95]

The *Cyropaedia*'s influence on political philosophy proved especially profound and lasting. Medieval writers of "mirrors for princes"—advice literature for rulers—drew heavily on Xenophon's portrayal of the ideal leader.[^96] During the Renaissance, the work enjoyed renewed prominence as European monarchs and their advisors sought models for effective governance.[^97] Thinkers including Machiavelli, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Francis Bacon, Jonathan Swift, Bolingbroke, Shaftesbury, Edward Gibbon, and Benjamin Franklin all esteemed Xenophon as both philosopher and historian.[^98]

Machiavelli's engagement with the *Cyropaedia* in *The Prince* represented both homage and radical critique, as he rejected Xenophon's idealistic premises while adopting his analytical approach to power.[^99] This dialectical relationship helped foster the development of modern realist political thought that broke from medieval idealism.[^100] Through Machiavelli's mediation, Xenophon indirectly influenced the entire subsequent tradition of political realism.[^101]

In classical antiquity, Xenophon enjoyed tremendous prestige. Polybius, Cicero, Tacitus, Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Quintilian, Aulus Gellius, and Longinus all thought highly of Xenophon and his works.[^102] Roman statesmen and generals studied his writings, and his prose style was celebrated for its clarity and elegance—the Attic Muse, as one admirer called it.[^103] For at least two millennia, scholars debated whether Xenophon was primarily a general, historian, or philosopher, testament to his multifaceted contributions.[^104]

Xenophon's preservation of Socratic teachings in the *Memorabilia*, *Symposium*, *Apology*, and *Oeconomicus* provided an alternative tradition to Plato's dialogues.[^105] While modern philosophy has generally privileged Plato's account, Xenophon's more practical and accessible presentation of Socratic thought influenced popular understanding of the philosopher and may more accurately represent certain aspects of the historical Socrates.[^106] These works remained the only surviving Socratic dialogues apart from Plato's (and some apocryphal works), making them irreplaceable sources for understanding the Socratic tradition.[^107]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Recent scholarship has witnessed a significant rehabilitation of Xenophon's reputation after a period of relative neglect during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.[^108] Leading scholars including Vivienne Gray have produced extensive work demonstrating the sophistication and literary artistry of Xenophon's writings.[^109] Modern literary approaches including narratology and historicism have revealed depths in Xenophon's works previously overlooked by scholars focused narrowly on factual accuracy or philosophical rigor.[^110]

Straussian scholars, following Leo Strauss's careful readings, argue that Xenophon employed subtle irony and esoteric writing techniques to convey philosophical teachings that surface readings miss.[^111] According to this interpretation, apparent simplicity masks sophisticated political and philosophical reflection, with Xenophon using historical and biographical narratives to explore fundamental questions about justice, governance, and the good life.[^112] These scholars contend that dismissing Xenophon as philosophically unsophisticated reflects modern biases rather than fair evaluation of his actual achievement.[^113]

Defenders of Xenophon's historical writing note that his eyewitness accounts of events he participated in provide invaluable primary source material unavailable elsewhere.[^114] The *Anabasis* offers unparalleled detail about Persian geography, society, and military organization, while the *Hellenica* preserves essential information about fourth-century Greek history despite its biases.[^115] Scholars argue that recognizing Xenophon's biases and agenda allows historians to extract valuable information while accounting for distortions.[^116]

The recent renaissance in Xenophon studies has produced numerous scholarly volumes and conferences devoted to reassessing his contributions.[^117] The Cambridge Companion to Xenophon and other major scholarly publications present cutting-edge research demonstrating Xenophon's sophistication as a literary artist, historian, and thinker.[^118] This scholarship challenges the "poor man's Plato" dismissal, arguing that Xenophon pursued different but equally valid intellectual and literary goals.[^119]

Admirers celebrate Xenophon's versatility and ability to write authoritatively across multiple genres and disciplines.[^120] Rather than viewing him as a dilettante, they see a Renaissance man whose diverse interests and experiences provided unique perspective on Greek culture and thought.[^121] His combination of practical experience with philosophical reflection created works of enduring value that continue generating scholarly discussion and popular readership millennia after their composition.[^122]

### Negative Views

Critics maintain that Xenophon's historical unreliability seriously undermines his value as a source, particularly when his biases align with political agendas.[^123] His systematic distortion of events to favor Spartan interests in the *Hellenica* and *Agesilaus* crosses the line from perspective to propaganda, deliberately misleading readers about historical events.[^124] When more reliable sources can be compared with Xenophon's accounts, significant discrepancies frequently emerge, raising questions about his trustworthiness even when alternative sources are unavailable.[^125]

Philosophically, skeptics argue that Xenophon fundamentally misunderstood or misrepresented Socrates' teachings, presenting a conventional moralist rather than the radical philosophical innovator described by Plato.[^126] The "Socratic Problem" has largely been resolved in favor of Plato's account because Xenophon's portrayal seems insufficiently philosophical to explain why Socrates was prosecuted for impiety and corrupting youth.[^127] Critics contend that Xenophon's Socrates reflects the author's own conventional views rather than the historical philosopher's teachings.[^128]

The charge that Xenophon was "a jack of all trades, a master of none" retains force for critics who find his work superficial compared to specialists in each field.[^129] As a historian, he lacks Thucydides' analytical depth and methodological rigor; as a philosopher, he cannot match Plato's dialectical sophistication; as a military theorist, later systematizers like Frontinus surpassed him.[^130] His prose style, while clear, lacks the literary artistry of the greatest Greek writers.[^131]

Modern academic philosophy has largely excluded Xenophon from the philosophical canon, and critics argue this exclusion is justified.[^132] His pragmatic life advice and conventional moral exhortations, while potentially useful, do not constitute genuine philosophical inquiry in the rigorous sense.[^133] The bias against philosophers who give practical advice reflects legitimate concerns about intellectual depth rather than arbitrary prejudice.[^134]

Critics of the Straussian rehabilitation argue that finding hidden meanings and esoteric teachings in Xenophon's straightforward texts imposes sophistication that isn't actually present.[^135] The ironic and critical readings of the *Cyropaedia* and other works may reveal more about the interpreters' ingenuity than Xenophon's intentions.[^136] Sometimes, they argue, simple texts are simply simple, and Xenophon wrote exactly what he meant without hidden layers.[^137]
