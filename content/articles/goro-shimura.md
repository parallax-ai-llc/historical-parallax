## Summary

Goro Shimura, with Yutaka Taniyama, formulated the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture, a deep connection between elliptic curves and modular forms that was central to Andrew Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. His contributions to number theory, automorphic forms, and arithmetic geometry were foundational to the Langlands program.
