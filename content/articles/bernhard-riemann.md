## Summary

Bernhard Riemann was a German mathematician who made foundational contributions to analysis, number theory, and differential geometry. His Riemannian geometry became the mathematical framework for Einstein's general theory of relativity. The Riemann hypothesis, concerning the distribution of prime numbers, remains one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. Despite dying at just 39, his work profoundly shaped modern mathematics.
