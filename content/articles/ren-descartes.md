## Summary

René Descartes was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist who is regarded as the father of modern Western philosophy. He invented the Cartesian coordinate system, bridging algebra and geometry and founding analytic geometry. His philosophical method of systematic doubt led to his famous statement 'Cogito, ergo sum' (I think, therefore I am). Descartes made major contributions to optics, physiology, and the scientific method.
