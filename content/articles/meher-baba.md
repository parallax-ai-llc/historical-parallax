## Summary

Meher Baba was an Indian spiritual master who claimed to be the Avatar (God incarnate) of the age. He observed silence for the last 44 years of his life, communicating through an alphabet board and hand gestures. His teachings emphasized the evolution of consciousness and the role of the Avatar in human spiritual development. His famous saying 'Don't worry, be happy' became a cultural touchstone. He attracted followers in both India and the West.
