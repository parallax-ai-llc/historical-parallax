## Summary

Masanobu Fukuoka was a Japanese farmer and philosopher who developed 'natural farming,' a method of agriculture inspired by Zen Buddhism and Taoist principles. His book The One-Straw Revolution became a classic of the environmental and organic farming movements. He advocated for 'do-nothing' farming — working with nature rather than trying to dominate it. His philosophy extended beyond agriculture to a comprehensive spiritual worldview of simplicity and harmony with nature.
