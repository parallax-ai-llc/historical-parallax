## Summary

Shams Tabrizi was a Persian Sufi mystic who is best known for his transformative relationship with Rumi. His encounter with Rumi in Konya in 1244 transformed the conventional scholar into an ecstatic mystic poet. He challenged Rumi through unconventional spiritual methods that scandalized Rumi's students. He mysteriously disappeared, possibly murdered, and Rumi's grief inspired some of the greatest mystical poetry ever written.
