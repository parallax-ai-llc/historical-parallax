## Summary

King Yejong (1079-1122), personal name Wang U, was the 16th ruler of the Goryeo dynasty and one of Korea's most culturally accomplished monarchs.[^1] His reign from 1105 to 1122 is remembered as one of the most splendid periods of Goryeo, marked by extraordinary achievements in arts, philosophy, education, and military reforms.[^2] The eldest son of King Sukjong and Queen Myeongui, Yejong inherited both a flourishing kingdom and ongoing conflicts with the Jurchen tribes in the north. His legacy encompasses groundbreaking educational institutions, the promotion of Taoism alongside Buddhism, military innovations including the elite Byeolmuban army, and the establishment of Korea's aak musical tradition through exchanges with Song Dynasty China.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Born on February 11, 1079, Wang U entered the world as the eldest son of King Sukjong and Queen Myeongui of the Goryeo dynasty.[^4] His birth placed him directly in line for succession to the throne of one of medieval Korea's most powerful kingdoms. Growing up in the royal palace at Gaegyeong (modern-day Kaesong), the young prince received an education befitting his status, studying Confucian classics, military strategy, Buddhist teachings, and the arts.[^5]

Yejong's formative years coincided with his father's ambitious reign, during which King Sukjong implemented policies to strengthen royal authority and check the power of the central aristocracy.[^6] The prince witnessed firsthand his father's struggles with the emerging Jurchen threat along Goryeo's northern borders, experiences that would profoundly shape his own military policies. In 1100, at the age of 21, Wang U was formally designated as crown prince, beginning his preparation for eventual kingship.[^7]

During his years as crown prince, Yejong developed a deep interest in both Buddhism and Taoism, philosophical traditions that would later flourish under his patronage as king.[^8] He also cultivated relationships with scholars and officials, including the renowned Confucian scholar-turned-Taoist hermit Kwak Yeo (1058-1130), with whom he would later exchange poetry and seek counsel.[^9] These early intellectual pursuits revealed a contemplative nature that contrasted with the martial demands of his position.

The death of his father King Sukjong in 1105, while the monarch was traveling to the western capital of Pyongyang, brought an abrupt end to Yejong's time as crown prince.[^10] At age 26, he ascended to the throne, inheriting not only the crown but also an unresolved military conflict with the Jurchen tribes that his father had been unable to quell. The young king would soon face his first major test as he confronted the northern invaders who threatened Goryeo's territorial integrity and security.

## Rise to Power

Yejong's accession to the throne in 1105 came at a critical moment in Goryeo's history, as the kingdom faced mounting pressure from Jurchen tribes along its northeastern frontier.[^11] Unlike many monarchs who must struggle for power, Yejong's succession was relatively smooth, facilitated by his status as the eldest legitimate son and his prior designation as crown prince. However, the challenges awaiting him were formidable and would define the early years of his reign.

Almost immediately upon taking the throne, Yejong confronted the Jurchen crisis that had plagued his father's final years.[^12] In 1104, during King Sukjong's reign, the Wanyan Jurchens had reached Chongju while pursuing resisting tribes, and when Goryeo sent General Im Kan to confront them, his untrained army suffered a humiliating defeat, resulting in the loss of Chongju castle.[^13] This failure had prompted Sukjong to commission General Yun Kwan to create an elite military force, but the king died before seeing the campaign through to completion.

The new king inherited both this unfinished military initiative and the challenge of asserting his authority over a court divided by competing factions.[^14] The Gaegyeong faction, representing the capital's central aristocracy, competed for influence with the Seogyeong faction, which favored the western capital. These factional tensions, which had been suppressed by his father's strong personality and political acumen, threatened to reemerge under the young monarch.[^15]

In October 1107, when news arrived that Jurchens had invaded the northeastern border, Yejong demonstrated decisive leadership by mobilizing a massive army of 170,000 men under General Yun Kwan's command.[^16] This force, built around the elite Byeolmuban (Special Warfare Army) that his father had initiated, represented one of the largest military mobilizations in Goryeo's history. The campaign initially succeeded brilliantly, with Yun Kwan's forces occupying the Hamhŭng plains, advancing into the Tumen basin, and constructing nine strategic fortresses by April 1108.[^17]

However, Yejong's consolidation of power faced significant challenges beyond the military sphere. When he attempted to implement his father's monetary reforms in 1112, expanding the use of currency beyond the traditional barter economy, he encountered fierce opposition from conservative bureaucrats.[^18] These officials invoked the Ten Injunctions of Taejo, Goryeo's founding king, arguing that the reforms violated the founder's warning against adopting foreign customs.[^19] Though Yejong defended the policy by noting that even the Liao dynasty used currency and that Taejo's injunction was directed at extravagant spending rather than practical economic reforms, he ultimately could not overcome this resistance, and the coins failed to achieve widespread circulation.[^20]

## Major Achievements

King Yejong's reign witnessed extraordinary accomplishments across multiple domains, establishing him as one of Goryeo's most culturally significant monarchs. His achievements in education, military organization, cultural exchange, and religious patronage transformed Korean society and left lasting legacies that endured for centuries.

### Educational Reforms and Institutions

In July 1109, just two months after the controversial decision to yield the nine forts to the Jurchens, Yejong introduced comprehensive reforms to Gukjagam, the National Academy.[^21] He established seven courses of study based on the Five Classics, the Rites of Zhou, and—most innovatively—military studies, marking the first recorded occasion of a Korean dynasty providing formal training in the military arts.[^22] This curriculum innovation, known as Kang Ye-jae (also called Muhak-jae), was revolutionary for Goryeo's aristocratic society, though it proved controversial and was removed from the curriculum in 1133, shortly after his death.[^23]

Yejong's educational initiatives extended beyond curriculum reform. In 1116, he created academic institutions and libraries including Cheongyeongak and Bomungak, centers of learning that attracted scholars throughout the kingdom.[^24] Most significantly, in 1119 he established the Yanghyeongo (養賢庫), or "Foundation for the Training of Talents," a scholarship foundation that supported promising students and helped reinvigorate government-sponsored education, which had long been overshadowed by private schools.[^25] These reforms strengthened Yejong's royal authority, which had been damaged by the failure to permanently hold the northern fortresses, while simultaneously creating a cultural flowering that defined his era.[^26]

### Military Innovations and Campaigns

The creation and deployment of the Byeolmuban (別武班, "Special Warfare Army") represents one of Yejong's most significant military achievements.[^27] This elite force, initially conceived by General Yun Kwan during King Sukjong's reign, was reorganized and expanded under Yejong's direction into a sophisticated army of six divisions: the regular army and Armor Guards (chŏnggyugun), Infantry (Sinbogun), Cavalry (Sin'gigun), an army of Buddhist monks (Hangmagun), supporting troops made of slaves (Yŏnhogun), and volunteer soldiers from merchants and ordinary citizens (Chubugunhyŏn).[^28]

The Byeolmuban's 1107-1108 campaign against the Jurchens achieved remarkable military success, with Yun Kwan's approximately 170,000-strong force capturing 135 strategic Jurchen positions and killing or capturing about 5,000 enemy combatants.[^29] The construction of the Nine Fortresses (동북 9성, 東北九城) in strategic locations including Hamju, Yeongju, Eungju, Bokju, Gilju, and Gongheomjin represented the campaign's crowning achievement, with a monument erected at Gongheomjin to mark the border between Goryeo and Jurchen territory.[^30] Though political considerations and unceasing Jurchen diplomatic appeals ultimately led to the fortresses' return in May 1109, the campaign demonstrated Goryeo's military capabilities and temporarily secured its northern borders.[^31]

### Cultural and Diplomatic Achievements

Yejong's reign marked the beginning of Korea's aak musical tradition through unprecedented cultural exchanges with Song Dynasty China.[^32] In 1114, he sent a request to Song Emperor Huizong asking for Chinese musical instruments to conduct proper Confucian rituals at his palace in Gaeseong.[^33] Huizong responded with a generous gift of instruments for royal banquet music. Two years later, in 1116, Yejong sent another petition, and Huizong sent an even larger gift of 428 yayue instruments, along with ritual dance regalia and detailed instructions, establishing the foundation for Korea's court music tradition that continues to this day.[^34]

The king's interest in cultural development extended to diverse fields. He gathered rare Korean plants to exchange for Chinese species, demonstrating his passion for botany.[^35] During his reign, the Goryeo celadon industry flourished, with Korean designs predominating over Chinese influences for the first time, marking a crucial moment in the development of Korea's distinctive ceramic aesthetic.[^36] The Song envoy Xu Jing (1091-1153), who visited Goryeo in 1122 as part of a large Chinese mission, documented these cultural achievements in his work "Xuanhe fengshi Gaoli tujing" (Illustrated Record of the Chinese Embassy to the Goryeo Court during the Xuanhe Era), providing invaluable observations about this golden age.[^37]

### Social Welfare and Administrative Reforms

In response to famines, epidemics, and natural disasters that struck in 1109, 1110, 1117, and 1120, Yejong's government implemented comprehensive reforms reorganizing local administration, taxation, and labor systems.[^38] Agricultural promotion policies included cultivation of military lands and abandoned lands, helping to stabilize food production. In 1112, he established the Hyeminguk (惠民局), an institution dedicated to the free distribution of medicines to the poor, representing an early form of public healthcare.[^39] The following year, in 1113, he created the Yeuisangjeongso (Court of Etiquette) to define new standards for clothing, etiquette, and document management, bringing greater systematization to court procedures.[^40]

### Religious Patronage

Yejong expended extraordinary effort promoting Taoism, which he preferred over the previously ascendant court religion of Buddhism, though he supported both traditions.[^41] He ordered the teaching of the Daodejing and actively imported Taoist elements from Song Dynasty China. In 1110, Emperor Huizong sent ambassadors and two priests to Goryeo to instruct on Taoism, and that same year Yejong began the seven-year construction of Bogwongung, the country's first Taoist temple.[^42] The proliferation of Taoist court rituals during his reign profoundly influenced Goryeo celadon production, with artisans creating ceramics in the form of Taoist figures and decorated with Taoist motifs, as well as vessels inscribed with names of Taoist deities.[^43]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his many accomplishments, King Yejong's reign was marked by significant controversies that revealed the limitations of royal power and generated lasting criticism from both contemporaries and later historians.

### The Nine Fortresses Abandonment

The most significant controversy of Yejong's reign centered on his decision to abandon the Nine Fortresses in May 1109, barely a year after their construction.[^44] While the Byeolmuban's military campaign had been successful, capturing strategic territory and demonstrating Goryeo's military prowess, Yejong chose to accept the Jurchens' peace offer and return the fortresses. His decision was influenced by multiple factors: Korean territory had been devastated by famine and disease, maintaining the fortresses required substantial resources, and the Jurchens launched unceasing attacks and diplomatic appeals.[^45]

Critics argued that this withdrawal represented a strategic failure that surrendered hard-won territory and emboldened the Jurchens, who would later establish the Jin Dynasty and pose an even greater threat to both Goryeo and Song China.[^46] Indeed, Yejong had warned Song Emperor Huizong not to deal with the Jurchens because they "were like tigers and wolves," yet he himself agreed to their demands.[^47] This apparent contradiction damaged his prestige and undermined the royal authority he sought to establish through military success.

### Failed Currency Reform

Yejong's attempt to expand his father's monetary reforms in 1112 ended in failure and highlighted the constraints on royal power.[^48] When he confronted the opposing bureaucracy that adhered to the traditional barter economy and taxation in kind established by Goryeo's founder Taejo, conservative ministers invoked the Ten Injunctions of Taejo to support their opposition.[^49] Despite Yejong's argument that the founder's warning was directed at extravagant spending rather than practical monetary policy, and his citation of the Liao Dynasty's successful use of currency, the coins failed to achieve widespread circulation.[^50] The silver currency (eunbyeong or ŭnbyŏng) continued to be used mainly by nobles rather than becoming a general medium of exchange, representing a significant policy defeat.[^51]

### Military Training Controversy

The installation of Kang Ye-jae, the military training division within the National Academy, provoked intense opposition from Goryeo's aristocratic elite.[^52] As an aristocratic society, Goryeo was far more lenient toward martial arts training than the later Joseon Dynasty would be, yet even this modest reform challenged deeply held beliefs about the proper education for gentlemen. The aristocracy's resistance to military training for educated elites reflected tensions between civilian and military factions that would plague Goryeo throughout its history. Tellingly, the military curriculum was removed from the academy in 1133, just eleven years after Yejong's death, demonstrating that the reform lacked sustainable support.[^53]

### Factional Politics and Court Intrigue

The politics of Yejong's aides, which had continued from King Sukjong's time, intensified during his reign, strengthening the power of close royal associates while exacerbating the confrontation between the Gaegyeong faction and the Seogyeong faction.[^54] While Yejong's strong royal authority and personal leadership kept these conflicts suppressed, he created conditions for future instability. The necessity of constantly adjudicating factional struggles, combined with the strain of managing complicated diplomatic and military efforts, led Yejong to retreat increasingly into his books and Taoist rituals, creating a perception that he was avoiding governance challenges.[^55]

### The Yi Cha-gyom Marriage Alliance

Yejong's marriage to the second daughter of Yi Cha-gyŏm, leader of the foremost Kaesong aristocratic clan, was politically motivated to appease court officials who opposed his military campaign against the Jurchens.[^56] Yi Cha-gyŏm's father-in-law, Ch'oe Sa-chu, wielded significant political influence, and his brother-in-law, Kim In-jon, was a prominent figure vehemently opposed to the Jurchen war.[^57] While this strategic marriage temporarily resolved immediate political pressures, it created long-term problems. In 1109, Yi Cha-gyŏm's daughter (Queen Sundeok) bore a son who would become King Injong, and this family connection enabled Yi Cha-gyŏm to wield near-absolute power as regent after Yejong's death, eliminating political rivals and attempting to usurp the throne.[^58]

### Personal Excesses

In his later years, King Yejong developed serious health problems due to excessive drinking, dancing, and continuous banqueting.[^59] This lifestyle, documented by contemporary observers, contrasted sharply with the scholarly and philosophical image he cultivated and suggested a king struggling with the burdens of rulership. When he developed boils—described in some sources as cancer—he died within a month at the relatively young age of 44.[^60] Critics pointed to this dissolution as evidence of moral weakness and failure to maintain the self-discipline expected of a Confucian monarch.

## Personal Life

King Yejong's personal life revealed a complex individual whose intellectual pursuits, family relationships, and personal struggles shaped both his reign and his legacy.

### Marriages and Family

Yejong had two official queens during his reign.[^61] His first wife was Queen Gyeonghwa, Lady Lee, who was King Seonjong's eldest daughter, making this marriage a union between different branches of the royal family. His second and politically more significant marriage was to the daughter of Yi Cha-gyŏm, who became Queen Sundeok. This union, arranged to appease powerful court officials opposed to the Jurchen war, had profound political implications.[^62]

In addition to his queens, Yejong had at least one concubine: Sukbi Choi of the Haeju Choi clan, who served as head of Jangshin Palace during her lifetime and was posthumously honored with the title of "concubine" after the king's death.[^63] In 1109, Queen Sundeok bore Yejong's son, who would later ascend as Injong, the 17th monarch of Goryeo, reigning from 1122 to 1146.[^64] This succession would prove problematic, as it enabled Injong's maternal grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm to dominate the young king and nearly usurp the throne.

### Intellectual and Artistic Pursuits

Yejong maintained close relationships with scholars and cultivated a reputation as an intellectual monarch.[^65] He exchanged poems with his servant Kwak Yeo in question-and-answer format, demonstrating his literary abilities and willingness to engage with those of lower social status in intellectual discourse. His relationship with Kwak Yeo (1058-1130), the Confucian scholar who later became a Taoist hermit, was particularly significant—Yejong frequently invited him to the palace to ask for advice and exchange poetry.[^66]

The king's philosophical inclinations led him to compose works reflecting his worldview. In his "Yejong Policy Statement," preserved in the Dongmunseon (Volume 23), he wrote: "I reached Ming with emptiness and made a saint with death" (虛以致其明 思以作其聖), a statement revealing his engagement with Taoist and Buddhist concepts of emptiness and enlightenment.[^67]

### Personality and Character

Historical sources paint a picture of a king torn between contemplative scholarship and the demands of active rulership.[^68] His deep interest in Taoism, preference for its precepts over Buddhism (despite supporting both religions), and retreat into books and Taoist rituals when faced with factional struggles suggest a personality more suited to philosophical contemplation than political maneuvering.[^69] The Song envoy Xu Jing's observations from 1122 provide valuable contemporary perspectives on Yejong's court and character, though the specific personal details are limited.[^70]

Yejong's interest in botany—gathering rare Korean plants to exchange for Chinese species—reveals a curious mind engaged with the natural world.[^71] His passionate advocacy for Taoist teachings, going so far as to build Goryeo's first Taoist temple and import priests from China, demonstrates genuine religious conviction rather than mere political calculation.[^72]

### Health Decline and Death

The king's final years were marked by personal dissolution that contrasted sharply with his earlier scholarly pursuits.[^73] His excessive drinking, dancing, and continuous banqueting became sufficiently notorious to be recorded by court historians, suggesting a king who had lost direction or was attempting to escape the burdens of rulership. When he developed boils—described by some sources as cancer or malignant tumors—the illness progressed rapidly, killing him within approximately one month.[^74]

Yejong died on May 15, 1122, at the age of 44, having reigned for 17 years.[^75] His relatively young death cut short a reign that had shown both brilliance and significant flaws, leaving his 13-year-old son Wang Hae (King Injong) to inherit a throne that would soon fall under the domination of Yi Cha-gyŏm's regency.[^76]

## Legacy

King Yejong's death in 1122 marked the end of what historians generally regard as one of the most culturally splendid periods in Goryeo's history, yet his legacy encompasses both remarkable achievements and cautionary lessons about the limitations of royal power.

### Cultural and Educational Impact

Yejong's establishment of the Yanghyeongo scholarship foundation in 1119 created an institutional framework that strengthened government-sponsored education and helped it compete with private schools, a turnaround that continued well into his successor's reign.[^77] His introduction of seven courses of study to the National Academy, including the innovative addition of military training, represented a comprehensive educational vision that, despite the later removal of military studies, influenced Korean educational philosophy.[^78] The academic institutions and libraries he created—Cheongyeongak and Bomungak—became centers of learning that outlasted his reign.[^79]

Most enduringly, Yejong's cultural exchanges with Song Dynasty China established Korea's aak musical tradition.[^80] The 428 yayue instruments, ritual dance regalia, and detailed instructions sent by Emperor Huizong in 1116 created a foundation for Korean court music that has been preserved and performed continuously for over 900 years, earning UNESCO recognition as an Intangible Cultural Heritage. This represents perhaps Yejong's most tangible legacy, as aak performances continue at the National Center for Korean Traditional Performing Arts today.

### Religious and Artistic Legacy

Yejong's promotion of Taoism fundamentally altered Goryeo's religious landscape.[^81] While Buddhism remained influential, the introduction of Taoist court rituals, the construction of Bogwongung temple, and the importation of Taoist texts and priests from China created a religious plurality that enriched Korean spiritual life. The influence of Taoism on Goryeo celadon production during his reign resulted in distinctive ceramic styles featuring Taoist figures and motifs, as well as vessels inscribed with Taoist deities' names—artworks that remain prized by collectors and museums worldwide.[^82]

The flourishing of Korean celadon designs during his reign, when Korean aesthetic sensibilities predominated over Chinese influences for the first time, marked a crucial moment in the development of Korea's distinctive artistic identity.[^83] Xu Jing's observations in his "Xuanhe fengshi Gaoli tujing" documented this golden age, providing evidence that contemporary observers recognized the exceptional cultural achievements of Yejong's court.[^84]

### Military and Diplomatic Legacy

The creation and deployment of the Byeolmuban elite force demonstrated organizational capabilities that would influence Goryeo military structure for decades.[^85] Though the Nine Fortresses were abandoned, the campaign itself—capturing 135 strategic positions and temporarily expanding Goryeo's northern frontier—showed that Korean forces could compete with the formidable Jurchen cavalry when properly trained and equipped.[^86] Some historians argue that the expedition temporarily claimed parts of Manchuria, the land of Goryeo's ancestor kingdom Goguryeo, though this interpretation remains contested.[^87]

Yejong's diplomatic warning to Emperor Huizong that the Jurchens "were like tigers and wolves" proved prescient when the Jurchens established the Jin Dynasty and eventually conquered northern China, validating his geopolitical analysis even as critics questioned his decision to abandon the fortresses.[^88] His maintenance of Goryeo's neutrality between the Jurchens and Liao, while cultivating close cultural relations with Song China, represented a sophisticated diplomatic strategy that preserved Korean independence during a turbulent period.[^89]

### Political Legacy and Lessons

The darker aspects of Yejong's legacy emerged during his successor's reign, when the political arrangements he had made created crisis.[^90] The Yi Cha-gyŏm marriage alliance, intended to resolve immediate political opposition, enabled Yi's near-absolute power as regent over the young King Injong, leading to the elimination of political rivals, attempted usurpation, and court corruption.[^91] The suppression of factional conflicts through Yejong's personal authority, rather than institutional mechanisms, meant that tensions between the Gaegyeong and Seogyeong factions exploded after his death, culminating in the Myocheong Rebellion of 1135.[^92]

Yejong's failed currency reform demonstrated the practical limits of royal power when opposed by entrenched bureaucratic interests, a lesson that would inform subsequent monarchs' approaches to economic policy.[^93] Similarly, the removal of military training from the National Academy curriculum in 1133 showed that reforms lacking broad elite support could not survive their sponsor's death.[^94]

### Historical Memory

In Korean historical memory, Yejong occupies a complex position—celebrated for cultural achievements while critiqued for political failures.[^95] The "History of Goryeo" (Goryeosa), compiled during the Joseon Dynasty, describes his reign as one of Goryeo's most splendid periods, emphasizing the flourishing of arts and philosophy, even while noting his retreat into books and Taoist rituals when faced with factional struggles.[^96] Modern Korean historians generally view him as an important cultural patron whose educational and artistic initiatives enriched Korean civilization, though they debate whether his military campaigns represented justified defense or misguided adventurism.[^97]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern and traditional scholars who view King Yejong favorably emphasize his role as a cultural patron who enriched Korean civilization during a critical period of development.[^98] These historians argue that his establishment of the Yanghyeongo scholarship foundation and expansion of the National Academy's curriculum represented visionary educational policies that strengthened Goryeo's intellectual infrastructure for generations.[^99]

Supporters point to Yejong's importation of aak musical instruments and Taoist teachings as evidence of sophisticated cultural diplomacy that enhanced Korea's civilization while maintaining political independence from China.[^100] Unlike tributary relationships that implied subordination, Yejong's exchanges with Emperor Huizong were between equal partners, with Song China regarding Goryeo as a potential military ally rather than a vassal state.[^101] This diplomatic sophistication allowed him to import valuable cultural elements while preserving Korean autonomy.

Scholars specializing in Korean art history particularly praise Yejong's reign as the moment when Goryeo celadon developed its distinctive Korean aesthetic, moving beyond mere imitation of Chinese models to create original designs that remain celebrated worldwide.[^102] The Taoist influence on ceramic production during his reign resulted in unique artistic expressions that merged religious symbolism with practical craftsmanship, demonstrating how his religious patronage yielded tangible cultural benefits.[^103]

From a military perspective, favorable assessments emphasize that the Byeolmuban campaign successfully demonstrated Goryeo's capacity to project power beyond its borders, capturing 135 strategic positions and temporarily expanding the kingdom's frontier.[^104] The decision to abandon the Nine Fortresses, while controversial, showed pragmatic leadership—recognizing that maintaining distant outposts while facing famine and disease at home would weaken rather than strengthen the kingdom.[^105] His warning to the Song emperor about Jurchen ambitions proved prophetic, suggesting strategic insight that transcended immediate military considerations.[^106]

Educational historians credit Yejong with recognizing that formal military training was essential for national defense, making him the first Korean monarch to institutionalize military studies within the educational system.[^107] Though the reform was reversed after his death, it established a precedent that later dynasties would revive when military needs demanded it.

Defenders of Yejong's Taoist patronage argue that promoting philosophical diversity strengthened intellectual life by creating alternatives to Buddhist dominance, fostering the kind of religious and philosophical pluralism that characterized Goryeo's most creative periods.[^108] His construction of Bogwongung temple and importation of Taoist priests created institutional structures that enriched Korean spiritual life and influenced literature, art, and court ritual.[^109]

### Negative Views

Critics of King Yejong focus on his political failures and the long-term instability created by his policies and personal weaknesses.[^110] The abandonment of the Nine Fortresses represents, in this view, a strategic catastrophe that emboldened the Jurchens and wasted the resources invested in a successful military campaign.[^111] These scholars argue that maintaining the fortresses would have been challenging but feasible, and that Yejong's decision reflected political weakness rather than strategic wisdom—he yielded to court pressure and Jurchen appeals rather than defending Korea's security interests.[^112]

The failed currency reform reveals, according to critics, an inability to build consensus for necessary economic modernization.[^113] Rather than skillfully navigating bureaucratic opposition as stronger monarchs might have done, Yejong allowed conservatives to invoke the Ten Injunctions of Taejo to block rational policy, setting a precedent that made future economic reforms more difficult. The fact that silver currency remained confined to aristocratic circles demonstrated that he failed to achieve his policy objectives.[^114]

Critics point to the Yi Cha-gyŏm marriage alliance as evidence of political short-sightedness.[^115] By marrying the daughter of a powerful aristocrat to resolve immediate opposition to his military policies, Yejong created conditions for Yi's later domination of the young King Injong, including attempted usurpation and the elimination of political rivals.[^116] A stronger monarch, critics argue, would have confronted the opposition directly rather than accommodating it through a marriage that empowered a dangerous faction.

The intensification of factional conflicts between the Gaegyeong and Seogyeong factions during Yejong's reign, merely suppressed by his personal authority rather than resolved through institutional mechanisms, created conditions for the Myocheong Rebellion that would convulse the kingdom during Injong's reign.[^117] Critics argue that Yejong's retreat into books and Taoist rituals when faced with factional struggles represented an abdication of leadership responsibility—a king should actively manage and resolve conflicts rather than escape into intellectual pursuits.[^118]

Scholars critical of Yejong's religious policies argue that his preference for Taoism over Buddhism represented superficial engagement with foreign fashions rather than deep spiritual conviction.[^119] The rapid construction of Taoist institutions and importation of Chinese priests, followed by his personal dissolution into excessive drinking and banqueting, suggests that his religious patronage was performative rather than genuine. His death from illness caused by lifestyle excesses contradicted both Taoist and Buddhist teachings about self-cultivation and moderation.[^120]

Military historians critical of the Jurchen campaigns argue that the entire enterprise was poorly conceived—launching expensive military adventures to strengthen royal authority through martial glory rather than addressing genuine security needs.[^121] The fact that Korea ultimately returned the Nine Fortresses and accepted Jurchen peace terms suggests the campaign achieved nothing lasting while consuming resources needed elsewhere. The removal of military training from the National Academy curriculum in 1133 demonstrates that even this reform lacked sustainable support, indicating that Yejong misjudged the political feasibility of his educational innovations.[^122]

Some scholars argue that Yejong's cultural achievements, while impressive, came at the cost of practical governance—a king who patronizes the arts while failing to resolve currency reform, factional conflicts, and succession planning has misunderstood his primary responsibilities.[^123] The instability that characterized his successor's reign stemmed directly from Yejong's political failures, suggesting that cultural accomplishments cannot compensate for governance deficiencies.
