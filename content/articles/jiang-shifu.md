## Summary

Liu Shifu (劉師復), born Liu Shaobin, was one of the most influential anarchist revolutionaries in early 20th-century China. Born to a prosperous family in Guangdong province in 1884, he transformed from a promising scholar and violent revolutionary into China's leading anarchist theorist and organizer.[^1] During his brief 31-year life, he founded the Cock-Crow Society and published *The People's Voice* (*Minsheng*), the premier journal of Chinese anarchism in the 1910s.[^2] His followers initiated China's first modern labor unions and May Day celebrations, establishing a syndicalist movement that briefly rivaled early Marxist organizing.[^3] He died of tuberculosis in Shanghai in 1915, leaving behind a devoted following and a legacy as the "soul of Chinese anarchism."[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Liu Shaobin was born on June 27, 1884, into a prosperous family in Xiangshan County (now part of Zhongshan), Guangdong province.[^5] His father, Liu Biancheng, served as a local official and engaged in various business ventures, providing young Liu with educational opportunities unavailable to most Chinese children of his generation.[^6] The family's wealth and social position enabled Liu to receive a classical Confucian education, which he excelled at from an early age.

In 1898, at just fourteen years old, Liu earned the top place in the local examinations of Guangdong province, a remarkable achievement that demonstrated his intellectual capabilities and mastery of classical Chinese literature.[^7] This success positioned him for a promising career in the imperial bureaucracy, the traditional path for talented young scholars. However, like many educated Chinese youth of his generation, Liu was profoundly affected by China's humiliating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), which shattered confidence in the Qing dynasty's ability to protect China from foreign imperialism.[^8]

The failure of the 1898 Hundred Days' Reform and the subsequent Boxer Rebellion further convinced Liu that China needed radical transformation, not gradual reform. In 1902, he traveled to Japan to pursue Western studies, joining thousands of Chinese students seeking modern education abroad.[^9] Japan had become a hub for Chinese revolutionaries and reformers, offering both access to Western knowledge and a relatively safe environment for anti-Qing political activities. During his studies, Liu was exposed to various Western political philosophies, including anarchism, populism, and nihilism, all of which were circulating among Chinese expatriate communities in Tokyo.[^10]

## Rise to Power

Liu's political radicalization accelerated during his time in Japan. In 1906, he joined Sun Yat-sen's Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui), the leading anti-Qing revolutionary organization.[^11] However, Liu became increasingly frustrated with what he perceived as the Alliance's ineffective strategy of waiting for mass support. He received his introduction to anarchism in Japan, learning about Russian populist and anarchist movements, particularly the heroic narratives of young revolutionaries using violence against reactionary rulers.[^12]

Returning to China in the summer of 1906, Liu became involved in more radical activities.[^13] Together with Chen Jiongming and other revolutionaries, he formed the Chinese Assassination Corps in Hong Kong, an anarchist-inspired group dedicated to eliminating high-ranking Qing officials through targeted political violence.[^14] The Corps successfully assassinated a Manchu general but failed in attempts against two other high officials, losing two members in the process.[^15]

On the morning of May 1, 1907, Liu volunteered to assassinate Li Zhun, the Guangdong naval commandant, but the mission ended catastrophically.[^16] The bomb he was carrying exploded prematurely, blowing off all the fingers of his left hand.[^17] While being treated at a hospital, he was arrested on suspicion of being a revolutionary and subsequently imprisoned for approximately three years.[^18]

This imprisonment proved transformative. During his incarceration from 1907 to 1910, Liu studied anarchist literature extensively, completing his transition from violent nationalist revolutionary to theoretical anarchist.[^19] He emerged from prison with a fundamentally different political philosophy, rejecting individual acts of terrorism in favor of mass education and grassroots organizing. Liu later wrote that political assassination was not a viable long-term strategy for radical social change, fully renouncing these tactics by 1912.[^20]

## Major Achievements

Following the 1911 Revolution that overthrew the Qing dynasty, Liu adopted an explicitly anarchist position and began his most productive period of theoretical and organizational work. In 1912, he founded the Conscience Society (Xinshehui), which required members to adhere to a strict twelve-point covenant of personal conduct that reflected his moralistic anarchism.[^21] The twelve points included: not eating meat, not drinking liquor, not smoking tobacco, not using servants, not riding in sedan chairs or rickshaws, not marrying, not using a family name, not serving as an official, not serving as a representative, not joining a political party, not serving in the military, and not believing in religion.[^22] These principles demonstrated Liu's belief that anarchist revolution required not just political restructuring but fundamental moral transformation of individuals and society.

In the summer of 1912, Liu founded the Society of Cocks Crowing in the Dark (Huiming Xueshe), commonly known as the Cock-Crow Society, and began publishing *The People's Voice* (*Minsheng*), which became the leading organ of Chinese anarchism in the 1910s.[^23] The journal was published in both Chinese and Esperanto, reflecting Liu's commitment to international language unity.[^24] Liu served as chief editor, proofreader, and typesetter, working tirelessly despite his mangled left hand and deteriorating health.[^25] The Society's goals, articulated in its first publication in late 1913, included communism, labor unionism, opposition to militarism, opposition to religion and the traditional family, vegetarianism, language unity, and world community.[^26]

In July 1914, Liu published "Goals and Methods of the Anarchist-Communist Party," a comprehensive manifesto that synthesized his anarchist philosophy.[^27] Drawing heavily from Peter Kropotkin's theories, Liu outlined a vision of anarchist communism where all means of production—land, mines, factories, tools, and machinery—would be returned to common ownership, private property would be abolished, and money eliminated.[^28] Under this system, all products of labor would be common possessions, freely available to everyone according to their needs.[^29] Liu emphasized that implementing this morality required "labour" and "mutual aid," which he argued were inherent capacities of humanity rather than external impositions.[^30]

Liu was an exceptionally skilled expositor of anarchist doctrine. His polemical exchanges in 1913 with Jiang Kanghu, leader of the Chinese Socialist Party, and with Sun Yat-sen helped popularize anarchism as "pure socialism" and distinguish it from state socialism and reformist currents.[^31] He criticized both figures for their inclinations toward reformism, retention of private property, and state socialism.[^32] These debates clarified anarchist principles at a time when the ideology's boundaries were becoming blurred.[^33]

Though Liu died in March 1915, his followers ensured his legacy continued through labor organizing and publications.[^34] Members of Liu's group initiated China's first modern labor unions in 1917, organizing barbers and teahouse clerks in Guangzhou using syndicalist principles.[^35] In 1918, they led China's first May Day celebration in Guangzhou and founded *Laodong* (Labor), China's first labor journal.[^36] By 1921, anarchists had organized at least forty unions in Guangzhou.[^37] These pioneering efforts in China's labor movement predated the founding of the Chinese Communist Party and demonstrated the practical application of Liu's anarchist-communist vision.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his influence, Liu's anarchist philosophy faced significant criticisms both during his lifetime and from later scholars. His moralistic approach, heavily influenced by Buddhist and Confucian ethical traditions, struck some observers as excessively austere and impractical. Wu Zhihui, a Paris-based anarchist, wrote admiringly that if others emulated Liu's rectitude, it would speed realization of anarchist society from 3000 years to only 100 years—but the statement also implied the difficulty of finding such dedicated followers.[^38] Indeed, Liu's twelve-point covenant demanding vegetarianism, celibacy, and rejection of family ties proved too demanding for most potential recruits, limiting the movement's growth.[^39]

Modern scholars have questioned whether Liu's fusion of traditional Chinese philosophy with Western anarchism represented a genuine anarchist vision or a conservative moralism dressed in radical language. Edward S. Krebs, in his definitive biography *Shifu, Soul of Chinese Anarchism*, argues that Liu's later career possessed a "conservative moral quality" because it drew inspiration from traditional Chinese literature despite advocating radical reforms.[^40] This tension between traditional ethics and revolutionary politics created contradictions in Liu's thought that critics suggest were never fully resolved.

Liu's rejection of political action and his criticism of anarchists who entered parliamentary politics, such as Tokyo anarchists elected to the National Assembly, created divisions within the anarchist movement.[^41] His insistence on ideological purity sometimes alienated potential allies and contributed to sectarianism. When he criticized the "Pure Socialists" for not calling themselves anarchists despite having an anarchist platform, he revealed a rigidity that some contemporaries found counterproductive.[^42]

The practical limitations of Liu's anarchism became apparent after his death. Although the Shanghai Association of Anarchist Communist Comrades called for unity among comrades in 1914, this unity collapsed nine months later when Liu died.[^43] Without his charismatic leadership and moral authority, the movement fragmented. By the early 1920s, anarchism in East Asia had entered terminal decline.[^44] After the Russian Revolution, Bolshevik communists established revolutionary societies with superior organizational abilities and Soviet financial backing, rapidly eclipsing anarchist influence in labor movements.[^45]

Liu's strict vegetarianism, inspired by Leo Tolstoy, also drew criticism as impractical moralism. Even as tuberculosis ravaged his body in 1915, Liu refused his doctor's advice to eat meat to maintain his strength, adhering to his principles until death.[^46] While admirers saw this as principled commitment, critics viewed it as self-destructive rigidity that deprived the movement of his leadership at a critical moment.

## Personal Life

Liu Shifu's personal life reflected his radical rejection of conventional social arrangements. As part of his commitment to the twelve-point Conscience Society covenant, he opposed marriage and the traditional family system, which he viewed as oppressive institutions that perpetuated inequality and private property.[^47] Historical sources provide limited details about his romantic relationships or personal intimacy, though his anti-marriage stance was public and principled rather than circumstantial.

From his early reform activities, Liu consistently worked on behalf of women's education and rights.[^48] He founded a girls' school in Xiangshan, though the project faced opposition from the local gentry elite and had to rely on private funding after government support was denied.[^49] This commitment to women's education demonstrated that Liu's opposition to the traditional family stemmed from feminist principles rather than misogyny—he sought to liberate women from patriarchal structures, not exclude them from revolutionary activity.

Liu's personality combined intense dedication with moral severity. He adored Leo Tolstoy not only for his anarchist philosophy but also for his moral example, adopting Tolstoy's vegetarianism as part of his broader ethical framework.[^50] His devotion to living anarchist principles extended to refusing servants, rejecting sedan chairs and rickshaws (to avoid exploiting human labor), and abandoning his family name to symbolize the dissolution of hierarchical kinship structures.[^51]

Despite his mangled left hand—a permanent reminder of the 1907 bombing attempt—Liu worked tirelessly on *The People's Voice*, serving simultaneously as editor, proofreader, and typesetter.[^52] Even as tuberculosis left him bedridden during his final years, he continued his editorial work with remarkable dedication.[^53] Colleagues remembered him as intellectually brilliant but demanding, holding himself and others to exacting standards of anarchist conduct.

Liu's family members shared his revolutionary commitment. His younger brother, Liu Shixin, became an important anarchist labor organizer, working with Wu Zhihui and Liang Bingxian to found the labor journal *Laodong* in 1918.[^54] Another brother, Liu Kafei, became editor-in-chief of newspapers in Manila and Kuala Lumpur, spreading anarchist ideas throughout Southeast Asia.[^55] This family tradition of radical activism suggests that Liu's revolutionary path was shaped partly by shared family values and experiences of China's crisis.

## Legacy

Liu Shifu's death at age 30 on March 27, 1915, was a severe blow to Chinese anarchism, but his influence extended far beyond his brief life.[^56] During the May Fourth Movement (1919) and the New Culture Movement of the late 1910s and early 1920s, anarchist thought enjoyed considerable popularity among students and young intellectuals in Beijing, Shanghai, and other cities, drawing substantially on Liu's theoretical framework.[^57] His emphasis on mutual aid (huzhu) became a watchword for Chinese activists across the political spectrum.[^58]

*The People's Voice* continued publishing until at least 1922 (sources differ on whether it ceased in 1916 or 1922), and many of Liu's comrades played prominent roles in the Chinese anarchist movement for years after his death.[^59] His disciples formed anarchist-inspired labor organizations, including the Workers' Mutual Aid Society of 1921, an umbrella organization for over forty smaller labor unions.[^60] These organizational achievements demonstrated that Liu had succeeded in building institutional structures that could survive his death, at least temporarily.

Liu's theoretical contributions helped define anarchism as a distinct ideology in the Chinese context. His debates with Jiang Kanghu and Sun Yat-sen clarified anarchism's differences from state socialism, Marxism, and reformist nationalism.[^61] He acknowledged Marxist contributions to socialism but argued that anarchism was more scientific than Marxist "scientific socialism," given Peter Kropotkin's contributions to evolutionary theory and social science.[^62] This claim to scientific legitimacy helped anarchism compete with Marxism for intellectual credibility during the 1910s and early 1920s.

Liu is regularly cited as the "intellectual father of Chinese anarchism" and sometimes compared to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as a foundational anarchist thinker.[^63] His particular synthesis of evolutionary theory, moral principle, and autonomous revolutionary action was even classified as its own distinct ideology: "Shifuism."[^64] While he did not originate many entirely novel ideas, his ability to synthesize Western anarchist theory with Chinese intellectual traditions created a culturally resonant revolutionary philosophy.[^65]

However, Liu's legacy also includes the ultimate failure of Chinese anarchism. By the mid-1920s, anarchists were rapidly losing ground to the Communist Party, and in the 1930s the movement's influence dwindled into insignificance.[^66] Historians debate whether this failure resulted from inherent weaknesses in anarchist theory, the superior organization and resources of the Communists, or historical contingencies. Liu's emphasis on moral transformation and grassroots organizing, while principled, proved less effective than the Communists' disciplined party organization and willingness to pursue state power.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars sympathetic to anarchism have praised Liu Shifu as a principled revolutionary whose commitment to living his ideals set a powerful moral example. Edward S. Krebs' comprehensive biography portrays Liu as the "soul of Chinese anarchism," whose devotion to promoting the common good through educational reforms and labor organizing influenced subsequent generations.[^67] Krebs emphasizes Liu's synthesis of Western anarchist theory with Chinese intellectual traditions, particularly his creative engagement with Buddhism and evolutionary theory, as evidence of sophisticated theoretical work rather than mere imitation.[^68]

Contemporary anarchists viewed Liu as the paradigmatic anarchist, someone whose personal rectitude and theoretical clarity defined what genuine anarchism meant in the Chinese context.[^69] Wu Zhihui's statement that emulating Liu's example would dramatically accelerate anarchist society's realization reflects the movement's recognition that Liu embodied their highest aspirations.[^70] His rejection of political assassination after 1912, despite his earlier involvement in the Assassination Corps, demonstrated moral growth and principled evolution that admirers found inspiring.[^71]

Liu's contributions to China's labor movement receive particular praise. His followers' organization of China's first modern labor unions and May Day celebrations represented pioneering work that predated Communist organizing efforts.[^72] The syndicalist principles Liu advocated—worker self-organization, direct action, and rejection of political parties—offered an alternative path to social transformation that might have succeeded under different historical circumstances.[^73] Some scholars argue that Chinese anarchism's defeat resulted more from superior Communist resources and organization than from theoretical inadequacies.

Liu's emphasis on women's education and gender equality, his opposition to the oppressive traditional family system, and his commitment to vegetarianism and anti-militarism place him within progressive global movements of his era.[^74] His embrace of Esperanto reflected genuine internationalism and commitment to breaking down national barriers.[^75] These positions demonstrate that Liu's anarchism was not merely negative critique but a comprehensive positive vision of human liberation and social transformation.

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Liu's moralistic anarchism was fundamentally flawed, combining impractical utopianism with authoritarian moralism. The twelve-point Conscience Society covenant, despite being nominally voluntary, imposed rigid behavioral requirements that limited the movement's appeal and suggested moral absolutism inconsistent with anarchist principles of individual autonomy.[^76] The requirement to abandon family names, reject marriage, and adopt vegetarianism struck many potential supporters as eccentric demands unrelated to genuine social transformation.

Edward Krebs himself, despite writing admiringly of Liu, acknowledges that his later career possessed a "conservative moral quality" rooted in traditional Chinese literature.[^77] This critique suggests that Liu's anarchism was insufficiently radical, remaining trapped within Confucian and Buddhist ethical frameworks despite its revolutionary rhetoric. Rather than genuinely breaking with Chinese tradition, Liu may have simply repackaged traditional moralism in anarchist language, producing a hybrid that satisfied neither traditionalists nor genuine revolutionaries.

The practical failure of Chinese anarchism provides the strongest argument against Liu's legacy. Despite his organizational efforts and theoretical work, anarchism was decisively defeated by Communism within a decade of his death.[^78] This defeat suggests fundamental weaknesses in anarchist strategy and theory that Liu failed to address. His rejection of political parties and parliamentary action, his emphasis on moral education over material struggle, and his faith in spontaneous organization all proved inadequate against the disciplined Leninist party that seized power in China.

Critics also question whether Liu's extreme personal asceticism—working himself to death at age 30 while refusing medical treatment that violated his vegetarian principles—represented admirable dedication or self-destructive fanaticism.[^79] His death deprived the movement of its most talented leader at a critical moment, suggesting that his rigid moralism ultimately harmed rather than helped the anarchist cause. A more pragmatic leader might have compromised on personal principles to maintain health and continue organizational work.

Some scholars argue that Liu's anarchism was fundamentally incompatible with Chinese social conditions. His emphasis on individual moral transformation and voluntary association presupposed levels of education, material security, and social trust that did not exist in early 20th-century China. The Communists succeeded partly because their strategy of violent revolution and state-building responded more effectively to China's crisis than Liu's vision of gradual moral transformation and grassroots organizing.
