## Overview

The Battle of Leyte Gulf (October 23–26, 1944) is widely considered the **largest naval battle in history**, involving over 200,000 naval personnel and hundreds of ships. It was precipitated by General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines ("I have returned"). The Empire of Japan, knowing that losing the Philippines would cut off their oil supply from Southeast Asia, threw the entire remaining strength of their Combined Fleet into a desperate, complex plan (Sho-Go 1) to destroy the US landing fleet. The battle saw the end of the Japanese Navy as an effective force and the terrifying debut of the **Kamikaze** suicide corps.

## Order of Battle

### United States (Third & Seventh Fleets)
**Commanders:** Adm. **William Halsey** (bullish, aggressive) & Adm. **Thomas Kinkaid**.
**Strength:**
- 8 Fleet Carriers, 8 Light Carriers, 18 Escort Carriers.
- 12 Battleships.
- 1,500+ Aircraft.
**Technology:** Radar fire-control (allowed shooting in dark/smoke), VT Fuzes (antiaircraft shells that exploded near planes).

### Imperial Japan (Combined Fleet)
**Commanders:** Adm. **Takeo Kurita**, Adm. **Jisaburo Ozawa** (Decoy).
**Strength:**
- 1 Fleet Carrier, 3 Light Carriers (all with very few planes - used as bait).
- 9 Battleships (Including the super-battleships **Yamato** and **Musashi**).
- **The Plan:** Sacrifice the carriers (North) to lure Halsey away, then sneak the battleships (Center) through the straits to massacre the undefended transport ships at Leyte.

## The Four Key Actions

### 1. Battle of the Sibuyan Sea (Oct 24)
US planes attacked Kurita's Center Force.
**Sinking of the Musashi:**
The sister ship of the *Yamato*. Took **19 torpedoes and 17 bombs** to sink. (Compare to *Titanic* which hit one iceberg).
Kurita turned around (temporarily), making Halsey think he was retreating.

### 2. Battle of Surigao Strait (Oct 25 - Night)
**The Last Battleship Duel:**
Japanese Southern Force tried to force the strait at night.
They walked into a trap set by US Rear Admiral Oldendorf.
US Battleships (many raised from the mud of Pearl Harbor) "crossed the T" and decimated the Japanese fleet with radar-guided guns.

### 3. Battle off Samar (Oct 25 - Morning)
**David vs Goliath:**
Halsey had taken all heavy ships north to chase the decoy carriers.
Left behind was "Taffy 3": tiny escort carriers and destroyers guarding the troopships.
Suddenly, **Yamato** (biggest gun in history - 18.1 inch) appeared on the horizon.
**The Charge of the Tin Can Sailors:**
US destroyers (*USS Johnston*, *USS Hoel*) suicidally charged the Japanese battleships to lay smoke and fire torpedoes.
**Result:** Admiral Kurita, confused by the ferocity and thinking he faced the main fleet, **retreated** just before victory.

### 4. Battle off Cape Engaño (Oct 25 - Afternoon)
Halsey sank the Japanese decoy carriers. (A hollow victory, as he left the landing beaches exposed).

## Kamikaze (Divine Wind)

**October 25:** First organized suicide attacks.
Targets: Escort carriers.
**USS St. Lo:** First major warship sunk by Kamikaze.
**Impact:** Psychological terror. A human-guided missile could not be jammed or dodged.
