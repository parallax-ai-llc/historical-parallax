## Summary
John Reginald Halliday Christie murdered at least eight people at 10 Rillington Place in London between 1943 and 1953. His case is infamous because innocent Timothy Evans was wrongfully executed for one of Christie's murders, contributing to the abolition of the death penalty in the UK.

## Early Life
