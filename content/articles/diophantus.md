## Summary

Diophantus of Alexandria was a Greek mathematician sometimes called the 'father of algebra.' His 'Arithmetica,' a collection of problems giving numerical solutions of determinate and indeterminate equations, was hugely influential. Diophantine equations, named after him, are polynomial equations seeking integer solutions. His work inspired Pierre de Fermat, who famously wrote his 'Last Theorem' in the margin of Diophantus's book.
