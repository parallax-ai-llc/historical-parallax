## Summary

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing (1876-1964) is considered one of the greatest Burmese poets, writers, and political leaders of the 20th century.[^1] Born as Maung Lun Maung, he became known as the Father of Burmese nationalist and peace movements as well as a literary genius whose influence shaped modern Myanmar identity.[^2] His revolutionary poetry blended classical Burmese verse with political satire, inspiring a generation of independence leaders including General Aung San.[^3] After independence, he devoted his life to peace activism, earning the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954 and an honorary doctorate from the University of Hamburg in 1960.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing was born Maung Lun Maung on March 23, 1876, in Wale Village near Shwedaung in Lower Burma, though some sources cite Wundwin in Mandalay Division as his birthplace.[^5] He came of age during one of the most turbulent periods in Burmese history, as British colonial forces consolidated their control over the country. At an early age, he was sent to Mandalay to receive a traditional education in Buddhist monastic schools, which was customary for young men of his generation.[^6]

The defining moment of Hmaing's childhood came at age nine, when he witnessed the fall of the Konbaung dynasty and the forcible removal of King Thibaw and Queen Supayalat by British colonial authorities in 1885.[^7] He watched near the queen's own Myadaung Monastery, where he was a boarding student, as the royal couple were taken away in a carriage—a scene that would haunt him throughout his life and spark his lifelong nationalist fervor.[^8] This traumatic experience of witnessing Burma's last monarchs being deposed became the foundational event that shaped his political consciousness and drove his commitment to Burmese independence.

His traditional Buddhist education in Mandalay provided him with a deep understanding of classical Burmese literature, Pali religious texts, and the rich literary traditions that he would later revolutionize with his political writings.[^9] This classical training gave him mastery over traditional poetic forms such as htika (learned religious commentaries) and laygyo gyi (a form of classical verse), which he would later subvert and transform into vehicles for anti-colonial resistance.[^10]

## Rise to Prominence

In 1894, at age 18, Hmaing moved to Rangoon (now Yangon) to begin his career as a playwright, writing traditional stage plays in verse based on historical Burmese myths and legends.[^11] These early theatrical works, performed under his birth name Maung Lun or Saya Lun, already demonstrated his ability to reach both educated elites and ordinary citizens through compelling narratives drawn from Burma's cultural heritage.[^12] However, he soon transitioned from theater to journalism, recognizing the greater potential of the written word to influence public opinion and mobilize nationalist sentiment.[^13]

In 1903, Hmaing married Ma Shin, whom he had met in Rangoon, marking an important milestone in his personal life.[^14] He moved to Moulmein (now Mawlamyaing) to work as a journalist for local newspapers, honing his skills as a writer and political commentator.[^15] In 1911, as the nationalist movement gained momentum throughout Burma, Hmaing returned to Rangoon to work for the influential Thuriya (Sun) newspaper, which became a platform for his increasingly political writings.[^16] He contributed regularly to Thuriya and other publications such as Dagon magazine, where he later became an editor, establishing himself as one of the most important voices in Burmese journalism.[^17]

The year 1916 marked a turning point in Hmaing's literary career with the publication of his satirical novel "Missata Maung Hmaing hmadawbon wuttu" (The Epistles of Mr Maung Hmaing), written under the pseudonym "Mr Maung Hmaing."[^18] The work caused an immediate sensation by mocking fashionable Anglophile Burmese who had adopted the British honorific "Mr" before their names—a trend the novel successfully helped to stop.[^19] The pseudonym became so famous that it stuck with him throughout his life, eventually becoming part of his permanent identity.[^20]

In 1921, Hmaing briefly left journalism to teach history at the National College, though this academic career did not last long.[^21] The most significant step in his political evolution came in 1934-1935 when he joined the Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association), the radical nationalist organization whose members adopted the title "Thakin" (Master) to assert that Burmese people—not the British—were the true masters of their own land.[^22] Despite being in his late fifties, Hmaing quickly rose to become the intellectual leader of this group of young radicals, bringing respectability and gravitas to their movement.[^23] From this point forward, he became known as Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, the name by which history would remember him.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### Literary Innovations and Cultural Impact

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing's greatest achievement was his revolutionary transformation of Burmese literature into a weapon of political resistance. He revitalized classical Burmese verse by blending it with satire, wit, and sharp political insight, creating a new form of politically engaged literature that resonated with both intellectuals and ordinary citizens.[^25] Scholar Anna Allott described him as "a man of many skills - a true Buddhist and a staunch patriot; poet and playwright; historian and teacher; pioneer writer and satirist" and called him "the single most revered literary figure in modern Burma."[^26]

Hmaing was particularly masterful in the traditional form of laygyo gyi verse, which he revived and infused with contemporary political content, transforming an archaic literary form into a vehicle for nationalist mobilization.[^27] His htika writings—satirical works presented in the form of learned Pali religious commentaries—became legendary for their ability to criticize colonial authorities and collaborationist politicians while maintaining plausible deniability through layers of allegory and traditional Buddhist discourse.[^28] His most famous satirical work, "Hkway htika" (On Dogs), castigated politicians for wasting time in futile squabbling when they should have been concentrating on fighting colonial rule, showing no mercy to political opportunists.[^29]

Contemporary poet and literary scholar Min Thu Wun commented that modern Burmese literature and political thought would be impossible to imagine without Kodaw Hmaing's works.[^30] His writings shaped the national imagination more profoundly than speeches or treaties, and to this day, his phrases, metaphors, and rhetorical structures remain embedded in Burmese political speech.[^31] He is arguably the most important Myanmar writer of the last century, known to young and old for both his politics and his contributions to Burmese literature.[^32]

### Leadership of the Independence Movement

As the senior leader of the Dobama Asiayone, Kodaw Hmaing provided the ideological foundation for Burma's independence struggle. He insisted that "a Burmese who does not think like a free person can never fight like a free person," emphasizing that colonizers "conquer first in the mind."[^33] This philosophical approach prioritized ideological liberation and cultural pride over violent resistance, though he supported militant conviction and disciplined nationalism.[^34] His leadership was not administrative but ideological—he provided the vocabulary, slogans, and moral justifications for resistance against colonial rule.[^35]

Hmaing personally mentored and advised the younger generation of nationalist leaders who would lead Burma to independence, including General Aung San, U Nu, and others who became the founding fathers of independent Burma.[^36] In September 1939, Hmaing formed the Burma Revolutionary Party with Aung San, which then joined forces with Ba Maw's Sinyetha Party to create the Freedom Bloc, a coalition committed to achieving full independence from Britain.[^37] This alliance between established politicians like Ba Maw and the younger, more radical Thakins represented a significant unification of Burma's anti-colonial forces.[^38]

In 1940-1941, Japanese officer Suzuki visited Burma secretly and met with Thakin Kodaw Hmaing and other nationalist leaders, promising military aid to support Burma's independence struggle.[^39] Hmaing and other Dobama leaders made the strategic decision to send Aung San and other young men—later known as the "Thirty Comrades"—to receive military training abroad with the goal of fighting the British.[^40] This decision proved instrumental in establishing what would become the Burma Independence Army.[^41] By 1941, Hmaing's reputation as an anti-colonial nationalist earned him a place on the British authorities' "Burma List," officially designating him as an "enemy of the state."[^42]

### International Peace Activism

After Burma gained independence in 1948, the country immediately plunged into widespread civil war among communist insurgents, ethnic militias, and government forces—a situation that caused Hmaing profound sorrow.[^43] He spent the rest of his life working tirelessly to bring internal peace to Burma, mediating conflicts between communists and government leaders and urging negotiation over fratricidal war.[^44] He warned that the price of liberation should not be a second national self-destruction through civil conflict.[^45]

Hmaing became a leading figure in the international peace movement during the Cold War era. In 1952, he attended the Peace Conference for the Asia Pacific Region in Beijing and was elected Chairman of the World Peace Congress (Burma).[^46] In 1953, he traveled to the People's Republic of China, Mongolia, Hungary, and the Soviet Union as part of his peace activism.[^47] His international efforts were recognized in 1954 when he was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize (later renamed the Lenin Peace Prize), one of the highest honors of the communist world.[^48] He continued his international peace work, attending the World Peace Conference in Ceylon and India in 1957.[^49]

In 1960, the University of Hamburg in West Germany awarded him an honorary doctorate in recognition of his literary contributions and peace activism, demonstrating that his reputation transcended Cold War divisions.[^50] In 1963, during his final years, Hmaing gave his active support alongside former Brigadier General Kyaw Zaw to the Internal Peace Committee during peace talks between Ne Win's Revolutionary Council government and various armed rebel groups.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Collaboration with Japanese Occupation Forces

One of the most controversial aspects of Kodaw Hmaing's career was his involvement with Japanese forces during World War II. When Japan invaded Burma in 1941-1942, many Burmese nationalists initially welcomed them as liberators who would help expel the British.[^52] Hmaing met with Japanese officer Suzuki in 1940, who promised military aid to the Burmese independence movement.[^53] Hmaing is categorized among Burmese collaborators with Imperial Japan during the war years, and there was a "Kodaw Hmaing faction" within the Thakin party during the Japanese occupation period.[^54]

However, the Japanese occupation quickly proved disillusioning as Japan installed a puppet state in Burma that lost the support of the Burmese people.[^55] Like many Burmese nationalists, Hmaing's collaboration with Japan stemmed from a strategic calculation to use any available means to achieve independence from Britain, rather than from ideological affinity with Japanese imperialism. The broader Burmese nationalist movement, including Aung San and the Burma National Army, would eventually turn against the Japanese in 1945, switching sides to support the Allied forces.[^56]

### Cold War Alignments and Communist Sympathies

Hmaing's acceptance of the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954 and his extensive travels to communist countries raised questions about his political sympathies during the intensely polarized Cold War period.[^57] The hammer-and-sickle emblem displayed on his mausoleum references this award and his associations with the communist world.[^58] Some critics viewed his international peace activism as aligned with Soviet propaganda efforts, though Hmaing also received recognition from West Germany, suggesting his peace advocacy transcended Cold War ideological boundaries.[^59]

After independence, Hmaing mediated between communist insurgents and the government, maintaining relationships with communist leaders even as they waged armed struggle against the Burmese state.[^60] This willingness to engage with all sides in Burma's civil conflicts reflected his commitment to national reconciliation but also made him politically suspect to anti-communist factions.

### Political Critiques and Relationship with Military Regime

Throughout his career, Hmaing was unsparing in his criticism of Burmese politicians whom he viewed as self-serving or ineffective. His satirical work "Hkway htika" (On Dogs) brutally attacked politicians for petty squabbling, and he showed no mercy to those he considered political opportunists.[^61] This willingness to criticize all sides earned him both respect and enemies across Burma's political spectrum.

When General Ne Win seized power in a military coup in 1962, Hmaing's advanced age and enormous moral authority made him the one political voice the military regime could not silence.[^62] His writing served as the only legitimate expression of alternative political views after the coup, though he was by then in his eighties and had only two years left to live.[^63] After his death in 1964, the military regime came to view his legacy with suspicion. On March 23, 1976, the centenary of his birth, over 100 students were arrested for holding a peaceful ceremony at his mausoleum near Shwedagon Pagoda.[^64] A student named Ko Tin Maung Oo was given a death sentence and hanged in Insein Prison in June 1976, becoming the first person executed under Burma's 1974 constitution.[^65] Since then, Thakin Kodaw Hmaing became anathema to Burma's military regimes, with his tomb becoming a site of resistance and his memory serving as a rallying point for opposition movements.[^66]

## Personal Life

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing married Ma Shin in 1903 after meeting her in Rangoon before his move to Moulmein.[^67] Historical sources provide limited information about his family life beyond this marriage, with most biographical accounts focusing on his professional achievements as a poet, writer, journalist, and political leader rather than his private domestic affairs.[^68] There is no available information in historical records about whether the couple had children.[^69]

By all accounts, Hmaing was deeply devout in his Buddhist faith, which informed both his literary work and his political philosophy. Scholar Anna Allott described him as "a true Buddhist and a staunch patriot," highlighting how his religious convictions and nationalist commitment were inseparable aspects of his identity.[^70] His use of traditional Buddhist forms like htika (Pali commentaries) to convey political messages demonstrated his ability to synthesize religious and political discourse.[^71]

Hmaing's personality combined scholarly erudition with populist appeal. He could write in both highly sophisticated classical forms that impressed intellectuals and in accessible styles that reached ordinary citizens.[^72] His use of humor, satire, and allegory made his political messages entertaining as well as instructive, contributing to his enormous popularity across different social classes.[^73]

In his later years, particularly after independence in 1948, Hmaing became increasingly focused on peace and reconciliation, expressing profound sorrow over Burma's descent into civil war.[^74] He stated that his last wish was to see a peaceful and united country, devoting less time to writing and more to mediation efforts as he aged.[^75] This shift from revolutionary firebrand to peace advocate reflected his Buddhist values and his genuine concern for the welfare of the Burmese people beyond narrow political considerations.

When he died at age 88 on July 23, 1964, he was universally mourned as a national hero.[^76] He was buried at Kandawmin Garden Mausolea near the southern gate of Shwedagon Pagoda, in a square-shaped building with perforated walls completed in 1966.[^77] His mausoleum stands alongside those of other great Burmese figures including Queen Supayalat, Daw Khin Kyi (wife of General Aung San), and U Thant (former UN Secretary-General), reflecting his status among Burma's most honored citizens.[^78]

## Legacy

### Literary and Cultural Impact

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing's influence on Burmese literature and culture cannot be overstated. He revolutionized political writing in Burmese by using poetry, satire, allegory, and Buddhist moral language to mobilize the public against colonial rule.[^79] His revival of traditional forms like laygyo gyi verse and htika commentaries with contemporary political content created a new literary tradition that subsequent generations of Burmese writers would follow.[^80] The poet Dagon Taya, who rose to prominence after independence, was described as "the direct heir of Kodaw Hmaing's politically oriented brand of literature, bringing to it a more sophisticated outlook and manner of presentation."[^81]

His legacy and influence on post-independence generations can still be felt in both literature and Myanmar's ongoing political situation.[^82] To this day, his phrases, metaphors, and rhetorical structures remain embedded in Burmese political speech and public discourse.[^83] He is remembered as the greatest Burmese poet of the 20th century and is often called Myanmar's "national poet laureate."[^84] His writings and ideas continue to influence Myanmar's political culture, national identity, and public rhetoric, securing his place as a foundational thinker of modern Myanmar.[^85]

### Political and Nationalist Legacy

Kodaw Hmaing is regarded as the Father of the Burmese nationalist and peace movements, having provided the ideological foundation for Burma's independence struggle.[^86] He helped lay the groundwork for national schools and colleges, paving the way for the emergence of leaders like General Aung San, U Nu, and U Thant.[^87] His mentorship of the younger generation of Thakins, who would lead Burma to independence and govern the country for decades, makes him the intellectual grandfather of modern Burmese political leadership.[^88]

His insistence on cultural pride and psychological liberation—his belief that colonizers "conquer first in the mind"—became foundational to Burmese nationalist thought.[^89] He inspired an entire generation of Burmese patriots to take pride in their history, language, and culture, and to take direct action such as student strikes and worker protests against colonial rule.[^90] His ability to foster immense national pride through literary and cultural work, rather than through violence or military action, demonstrated the power of ideas and cultural resistance in anti-colonial movements.[^91]

The military regime's fear of his continuing influence—demonstrated by the 1976 crackdown on students who gathered at his tomb—reveals the enduring power of his legacy as a symbol of resistance and alternative political vision.[^92] His tomb at Kandawmin Garden continues to serve as a site where Burmese people can express dissent and remember an alternative political tradition focused on peace, national reconciliation, and cultural pride rather than military authoritarianism.[^93]

### International Recognition and Peace Movement

Hmaing's international recognition, including the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954 and an honorary doctorate from the University of Hamburg in 1960, established him as a figure of global significance beyond Burma's borders.[^94] His peace activism during the Cold War era, working to mediate Burma's internal conflicts and participating in international peace conferences, demonstrated his commitment to applying Buddhist principles of nonviolence and reconciliation to political problems.[^95]

His warning that "the price of liberation should not be a second national self-destruction" remains tragically relevant to Myanmar's ongoing civil conflicts and political instability.[^96] His vision of a peaceful, united Burma free from both colonial oppression and internal strife continues to inspire those working for peace and democracy in Myanmar today.[^97]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers view Thakin Kodaw Hmaing as an indispensable figure in modern Burmese history whose contributions to literature and politics fundamentally shaped the nation. Anna Allott's assessment captures the scholarly consensus: "a man of many skills - a true Buddhist and a staunch patriot; poet and playwright; historian and teacher; pioneer writer and satirist - Thakin Kodaw Hmaing is the single most revered literary figure in modern Burma."[^98] This recognition acknowledges his multifaceted achievements across literature, journalism, education, and political leadership.

Literary scholar Min Thu Wun argued that "modern Burmese literature and political thought would be impossible to imagine without the works of Kodaw Hmaing," emphasizing his foundational role in creating the discourse through which modern Myanmar understands itself.[^99] His ability to synthesize traditional Burmese culture with modern nationalist politics created a distinctive form of resistance that was both deeply rooted in local traditions and effectively mobilizing against colonial power.[^100]

Admirers praise his moral courage and consistency throughout his long life, from witnessing the fall of the monarchy as a child to becoming an "enemy of the state" under British rule, to serving as the only political voice the military regime could not silence in his final years.[^101] His commitment to peace and national reconciliation after independence, despite the personal costs and political complexity, demonstrates his genuine concern for Burma's welfare beyond narrow factional interests.[^102] His Buddhist principles and emphasis on ideological liberation over violent resistance offered a moral and philosophical foundation for the independence movement that complemented the military and political strategies of younger leaders.[^103]

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptics raise several concerns about aspects of Kodaw Hmaing's career and legacy. His collaboration with Japanese occupation forces during World War II, while shared with many Burmese nationalists of his generation, represents a morally compromised decision that facilitated a brutal occupation.[^104] Though the Burmese nationalists' calculation that Japanese support could help achieve independence from Britain may have seemed pragmatic, it nonetheless involved collaboration with an imperial power whose occupation brought tremendous suffering to Burma and other Asian countries.[^105]

His acceptance of the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954 and extensive involvement with communist countries during the Cold War has been viewed by some as political naivety or even as alignment with Soviet propaganda efforts.[^106] While his peace activism may have been sincere, his willingness to accept honors from Stalin's Soviet Union—even after the dictator's death—raises questions about his judgment regarding authoritarian regimes. The hammer-and-sickle emblem on his mausoleum remains controversial, associating his legacy with communist ideology in ways that not all Burmese citizens embrace.[^107]

Some critics argue that Hmaing's role was more symbolic than substantive—that he served primarily as an elder statesman and moral authority while younger, more dynamic leaders like Aung San actually organized and led the independence movement.[^108] His emphasis on "ideological war" and cultural resistance, while important, did not address the practical political and military strategies necessary to achieve independence.[^109] His satirical attacks on politicians for "futile squabbling" may have been morally satisfying but did not always contribute constructively to the difficult work of coalition-building and political negotiation.[^110]

Finally, his peace activism after independence, while well-intentioned, ultimately failed to prevent or resolve Burma's civil wars, which continue to plague the country decades after his death.[^111] His mediation efforts between communists and the government, and his involvement in the 1963 peace talks, produced no lasting results.[^112] This raises questions about whether his approach to peace—emphasizing moral authority and Buddhist principles—was adequate to address the deep political, ethnic, and economic conflicts that drove Burma's violence.[^113]

## Famous Quotes

> "A Burmese who does not think like a free person can never fight like a free person."

This quote captures Hmaing's fundamental belief in ideological liberation as the prerequisite for political freedom. He insisted that colonizers "conquer first in the mind," and therefore mental and cultural decolonization must precede or accompany physical resistance.[^136]

> "The price of liberation should not be a second national self-destruction."

Spoken during Burma's post-independence civil wars, this warning reflects Hmaing's profound concern that Burma's various factions—communists, ethnic militias, and government forces—were destroying through fratricidal conflict what they had fought so hard to liberate from colonial rule.[^137]

> "They conquer first in the mind."

This succinct observation about the nature of colonial power became foundational to Burmese nationalist thought, emphasizing that psychological and cultural conquest preceded and enabled physical occupation. It justified Hmaing's focus on cultural resistance, literary activism, and fostering pride in Burmese history and traditions.[^138]

> "I will fight with poems for the independence of the country."

This declaration demonstrates Hmaing's belief in the power of literature as a weapon of resistance. His pen indeed proved mighty in instilling nationalism and patriotism among the Burmese people, showing that cultural and ideological work could be as important as military action.[^139]
