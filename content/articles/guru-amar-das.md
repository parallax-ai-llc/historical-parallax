## Summary

Guru Amar Das was the third Sikh Guru who strengthened the Sikh community through institutional reforms. He established the manji system of dioceses for spreading Sikh teachings and opposed the practice of sati (widow self-immolation). He made the langar a requirement before meeting the Guru, ensuring all visitors ate together regardless of caste. He collected hymns of previous Gurus in the Goindval Pothis.
