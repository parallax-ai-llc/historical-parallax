## Summary

Cosimo de' Medici founded the Medici political dynasty and built the Medici Bank into the largest and most respected financial institution in 15th-century Europe. He effectively ruled Florence for 30 years through financial power rather than formal title. He was a patron of the arts and learning, founding the Platonic Academy and supporting architects like Brunelleschi. He was posthumously named 'Pater Patriae' (Father of the Country) by the Florentine Republic.
