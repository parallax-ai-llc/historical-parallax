## Summary

Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276 BCE – c. 194 BCE) was a Greek polymath who served as the chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria and made groundbreaking contributions to mathematics, astronomy, geography, and poetry. He is best known for calculating the circumference of the Earth with remarkable accuracy using geometric principles and shadow measurements, achieving a result within 2-15% of the modern value depending on the unit conversion used[^1]. His inventive method, the Sieve of Eratosthenes, remains a fundamental algorithm for finding prime numbers that is still taught in mathematics courses today[^2]. Beyond his scientific achievements, Eratosthenes created one of the earliest known world maps, coined the term "geography," and made significant contributions to chronology by attempting to establish precise dates for major historical events[^3]. Despite facing criticism from contemporaries who called him "Beta" (second-best) for being excellent in many fields but supposedly master of none, his interdisciplinary approach and mathematical rigor established foundations that influenced scholars for centuries[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Eratosthenes was born around 276 BCE in Cyrene, a prosperous Greek city-state located in present-day Libya on the North African coast[^5]. Cyrene was renowned as a center of intellectual activity and was the birthplace of several notable philosophers, including Aristippus, founder of the Cyrenaic school of philosophy[^6]. Little is known about Eratosthenes' family background, though it is believed he came from a relatively affluent household that could afford to provide him with an extensive education[^7].

As a young man, Eratosthenes traveled to Athens, the intellectual heart of the Greek world, to pursue his studies[^8]. In Athens, he studied at the Academy founded by Plato and the Lyceum established by Aristotle, immersing himself in philosophy, mathematics, and literature[^9]. Among his teachers were the Stoic philosopher Ariston of Chios and the grammarian Lysanias of Cyrene[^10]. He also studied under the poet and scholar Callimachus, who would later become head of the Library of Alexandria and would play a crucial role in Eratosthenes' career trajectory[^11].

During his formative years in Athens, Eratosthenes gained a reputation as a versatile scholar with interests spanning multiple disciplines[^12]. He composed poetry, including works titled "Hermes" and "Erigone," and wrote extensively on philosophical topics, though most of these works have been lost to history[^13]. His broad intellectual curiosity, while admired by many, also led some contemporaries to view him as a dilettante who spread himself too thin across various fields rather than achieving true mastery in any single domain[^14]. This perception would follow him throughout his career, culminating in the nickname "Beta," suggesting he was always second-best[^15].

Around 245 BCE, Eratosthenes received an invitation that would transform his career and secure his place in history[^16]. Ptolemy III Euergetes, the ruler of Egypt and patron of learning, invited him to Alexandria to serve as tutor to his son and, more significantly, to become the third chief librarian of the famous Library of Alexandria, succeeding Apollonius of Rhodes[^17]. This position placed Eratosthenes at the center of the ancient world's greatest repository of knowledge, with access to hundreds of thousands of scrolls and the resources to pursue his wide-ranging intellectual interests[^18].

## Rise to Prominence

Eratosthenes' appointment as chief librarian of the Library of Alexandria marked the beginning of his most productive period and established him as one of the leading intellectuals of the Hellenistic world[^19]. The Library, founded by Ptolemy I Soter and expanded by his successors, was the ancient world's premier center of scholarship, housing an estimated 400,000 to 700,000 scrolls covering every field of human knowledge[^20]. As chief librarian, Eratosthenes not only oversaw this vast collection but also had the responsibility of acquiring new works, organizing the library's holdings, and fostering scholarly research[^21].

In this role, Eratosthenes implemented systematic cataloging methods and worked to expand the library's collections through various means, including the controversial practice of confiscating books from ships docking at Alexandria, having them copied, and returning the copies to the owners while keeping the originals[^22]. He attracted scholars from across the Mediterranean world to Alexandria, creating a vibrant intellectual community that engaged in cutting-edge research across multiple disciplines[^23].

Eratosthenes' reputation grew substantially due to his work in multiple fields during his tenure at Alexandria[^24]. He became known not just as an administrator but as an active researcher and theorist who made substantial contributions to geography, mathematics, astronomy, and history[^25]. His interdisciplinary approach was both innovative and controversial; while some admired his ability to synthesize knowledge across fields, others criticized what they perceived as a lack of depth in any single area[^26].

The nickname "Beta" or "Pentathlos" (after the five-event athletic competition) reflected this ambivalence among his contemporaries[^27]. The philosopher and geographer Strabo, writing several centuries later, reported that Eratosthenes' rivals in Alexandria considered him second-rate in multiple disciplines[^28]. However, this assessment may have been influenced by professional jealousy and the competitive atmosphere among scholars vying for patronage and recognition in the Ptolemaic court[^29].

Despite such criticisms, Eratosthenes enjoyed the patronage and friendship of Ptolemy III and later Ptolemy IV Philopator, which provided him with the resources and security to pursue ambitious research projects[^30]. His position at the library also allowed him to correspond with leading scholars throughout the Greek world, including Archimedes, with whom he maintained a productive intellectual exchange[^31]. A famous problem in mathematics, the Delian Problem (doubling the cube), was communicated to Eratosthenes by Archimedes through a letter that has been preserved[^32].

## Major Achievements

### Measurement of Earth's Circumference

Eratosthenes' most celebrated achievement was his remarkably accurate calculation of the Earth's circumference, performed around 240 BCE[^33]. His method demonstrated both geometric ingenuity and careful empirical observation[^34]. Eratosthenes had learned that at noon on the summer solstice in the city of Syene (modern Aswan, Egypt), the sun was directly overhead, as evidenced by sunlight reaching the bottom of deep wells without casting shadows[^35]. At the same time in Alexandria, located directly north of Syene, vertical objects cast shadows[^36].

Eratosthenes measured the angle of the shadow cast by a vertical stick (gnomon) in Alexandria at noon on the summer solstice and found it to be approximately 7.2 degrees, or about 1/50th of a full circle[^37]. Assuming the Earth was spherical and the sun's rays were essentially parallel when reaching Earth (due to the sun's great distance), he reasoned that this angle represented 1/50th of the Earth's full circumference[^38]. He then multiplied the distance between Alexandria and Syene (which he knew to be about 5,000 stadia) by 50 to arrive at a circumference of approximately 250,000 stadia[^39].

The accuracy of Eratosthenes' measurement depends on which stadion unit he used, as different Greek stadia had varying lengths[^40]. If he used the common Attic stadion of about 185 meters, his calculation would yield a circumference of about 46,250 kilometers, remarkably close to the modern value of approximately 40,075 kilometers at the equator[^41]. Even with less favorable interpretations of the stadion length, his result was impressively accurate for the time[^42]. This achievement demonstrated not only mathematical skill but also the power of combining theoretical reasoning with empirical observation[^43].

### The Sieve of Eratosthenes

In mathematics, Eratosthenes developed an elegant algorithm for identifying prime numbers that bears his name: the Sieve of Eratosthenes[^44]. This method works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2, with the unmarked numbers remaining as primes[^45]. The algorithm's efficiency and simplicity have ensured its continued use in mathematical education and computer science more than two millennia after its invention[^46].

The Sieve demonstrates Eratosthenes' ability to devise practical methods for solving theoretical problems[^47]. While not the fastest algorithm for finding primes in modern computing contexts, it remains conceptually important and is often a student's first introduction to algorithmic thinking in number theory[^48]. Eratosthenes also worked on other mathematical problems, including a mechanical device for duplicating the cube, one of the three classical problems of Greek geometry[^49].

### Contributions to Geography

Eratosthenes is often called the "father of geography" because he coined the term "geographia" (literally "earth description") and approached the subject with systematic rigor[^50]. He wrote a three-volume work titled "Geographica" that attempted to map the known world using a mathematical framework[^51]. This work, though lost except for fragments preserved in later authors' writings, represented a major advance in how the ancient world conceptualized terrestrial space[^52].

Eratosthenes created one of the earliest known world maps that incorporated mathematical principles and attempted to use lines of latitude and longitude, though not in the precise form used today[^53]. He divided the known world into geometric sections and attempted to calculate distances between major locations[^54]. His map extended from the British Isles in the northwest to Sri Lanka in the southeast, and from Scandinavia in the north to Ethiopia in the south[^55].

In his geographical work, Eratosthenes also made observations about climate zones, theorizing that the Earth could be divided into frigid, temperate, and torrid zones based on the angle of the sun's rays[^56]. He speculated about the possibility of sailing from Spain to India by heading west across the Atlantic, an idea that would influence later explorers including Christopher Columbus[^57]. His geographical writings combined mathematical calculation, astronomical observation, and reports from travelers and military campaigns[^58].

### Chronology and History

Eratosthenes made significant contributions to chronology with his work "Chronographiae," in which he attempted to establish a scientific timeline of major events in Greek and Near Eastern history[^59]. He tried to fix dates for events such as the Trojan War, which he dated to 1184 BCE, and created a list of Olympic victors to provide a consistent dating framework[^60]. This work represented one of the first systematic attempts to create a comprehensive historical chronology based on critical analysis of sources rather than mythology or tradition alone[^61].

His chronological work was influential for later historians and provided a framework that scholars used for centuries[^62]. While modern archaeology and historical methods have revised many of his dates, the approach of seeking verifiable chronological frameworks rather than accepting traditional dating uncritically represented an important methodological advance[^63].

### Astronomy and Mathematics

In astronomy, Eratosthenes compiled a catalog of 675 stars and made observations of astronomical phenomena[^64]. He calculated the tilt of the Earth's axis (obliquity of the ecliptic) with considerable accuracy, arriving at a value of approximately 23°51'20", very close to the actual value for his time[^65]. He also estimated the distance to the sun and moon, though these calculations were less accurate than his terrestrial measurements[^66].

Eratosthenes worked on the calendar, proposing reforms to reconcile the solar and lunar cycles more accurately[^67]. His "Platonicus," a mathematical work dedicated to the mathematics underlying Plato's philosophy, explored the mathematical relationships that Plato believed governed the cosmos[^68]. Though this work is lost, references to it in later sources indicate it was a substantial contribution to the intersection of philosophy and mathematics[^69].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The "Beta" Epithet

The most persistent criticism of Eratosthenes came from his contemporaries who nicknamed him "Beta," suggesting he was second-best in every field he attempted[^70]. This nickname reflected a genuine tension in how the ancient world valued specialized expertise versus broad learning[^71]. Critics argued that while Eratosthenes demonstrated competence across multiple disciplines, he lacked the deep mastery that came from dedicated focus on a single field[^72].

The Stoic philosopher and geographer Strabo, writing in the early Roman period, reported this criticism and sometimes echoed it, suggesting that Eratosthenes' geographical work contained errors and showed insufficient philosophical rigor[^73]. Hipparchus, the great astronomer and mathematician who followed Eratosthenes by a generation, criticized various aspects of his geographical and astronomical work, pointing out mathematical and observational errors[^74]. These criticisms, while sometimes valid in their specifics, may also reflect professional rivalry and different philosophical approaches to knowledge[^75].

### Methodological Limitations

Modern scholars have identified various limitations in Eratosthenes' work that were consequences of the knowledge and technology available in his time[^76]. His measurement of the Earth's circumference, while impressively accurate in principle, relied on several assumptions that were not precisely correct[^77]. The distance between Alexandria and Syene was not measured with precision but was likely based on estimates from travelers or official records of caravan routes[^78]. The two cities were not exactly on the same meridian of longitude, which would have introduced a small error into the calculation[^79].

His geographical work, while pioneering, contained significant inaccuracies in the placement of locations and the shapes of landmasses, as he relied heavily on reports from travelers, merchants, and military campaigns that were often imprecise or exaggerated[^80]. Hipparchus criticized Eratosthenes for accepting unreliable testimony and for mathematical errors in calculating distances and positions[^81].

### Loss of Original Works

A major challenge in assessing Eratosthenes' achievements and limitations is that virtually all of his original works have been lost[^82]. What we know of his ideas comes from fragments quoted by later authors, summaries in other texts, and critical commentaries by subsequent scholars[^83]. This fragmentary preservation means that our understanding of his work is filtered through the perspectives and agendas of later writers, some of whom were critical of his methods or conclusions[^84].

The loss of his works also means we cannot fully assess the sophistication of his arguments or the extent of his data collection[^85]. Later authors may have simplified his ideas, misrepresented his methods, or selectively quoted passages that supported their own viewpoints[^86]. This problem affects our understanding of many ancient scholars, but it is particularly acute for someone like Eratosthenes who worked across multiple disciplines and whose reputation has been shaped by both admirers and critics[^87].

### Philosophical Criticisms

Some ancient philosophers criticized Eratosthenes for what they perceived as excessive empiricism and insufficient attention to philosophical principles[^88]. Stoic geographers, in particular, sometimes took issue with his willingness to rely on observational reports and mathematical calculations rather than deriving geographical knowledge from first principles about the nature of the cosmos[^89]. This criticism reflects broader debates in ancient philosophy about the proper relationship between empirical observation and rational deduction[^90].

Conversely, some mathematicians and astronomers criticized Eratosthenes for not being rigorous enough in his mathematical proofs or for making assumptions that were not adequately justified[^91]. These competing criticisms—that he was both too empirical and not empirical enough, both too mathematical and insufficiently mathematical—suggest that Eratosthenes occupied a middle ground that satisfied neither extreme[^92].

---

## Personal Life

Very little is known with certainty about Eratosthenes' personal life, family relationships, or private character[^93]. Ancient sources provide few biographical details beyond his intellectual achievements and his professional role at the Library of Alexandria[^94]. This silence is not unusual for ancient scholars whose lives were often documented only in relation to their public intellectual contributions[^95].

Some sources suggest that Eratosthenes never married and had no children, dedicating himself entirely to his scholarly pursuits[^96]. However, the reliability of such claims is uncertain, as ancient biographers sometimes portrayed philosophers and scholars as ascetic figures devoted solely to intellectual work, regardless of the actual facts of their lives[^97].

Eratosthenes maintained friendships and professional relationships with many of the leading intellectuals of his time[^98]. His correspondence with Archimedes, the greatest mathematician and engineer of the age, suggests mutual respect between the two scholars despite their different specializations[^99]. The fact that Archimedes chose to send Eratosthenes a copy of his "Method" and dedicated problems to him indicates that Eratosthenes was recognized as a serious mathematician capable of engaging with advanced work[^100].

Personality traits can be tentatively inferred from the nature of his work and the reactions of contemporaries[^101]. His willingness to work across multiple disciplines suggests intellectual curiosity and confidence in tackling diverse problems[^102]. The nickname "Pentathlos" (in addition to "Beta") suggests that contemporaries saw him as an intellectual athlete who competed in multiple events rather than specializing in one[^103]. Whether this was meant entirely as criticism or contained an element of admiration for his versatility is unclear[^104].

According to later sources, Eratosthenes suffered from progressive blindness in his old age[^105]. Several accounts report that this loss of vision, which prevented him from reading and continuing his scholarly work, led him to stop eating voluntarily, resulting in his death around 194 BCE at approximately 82 years of age[^106]. This story, whether accurate or embellished, portrays a man for whom intellectual activity was so central to his identity that life without it seemed unbearable[^107].

His longevity was notable for the ancient world, and he appears to have remained intellectually active until the onset of blindness[^108]. He continued serving as librarian at Alexandria for decades, spanning the reigns of multiple Ptolemaic rulers[^109]. This stability and sustained patronage suggest he was skillful in navigating the political complexities of the Ptolemaic court, though no specific anecdotes about his political acumen have been preserved[^110].

## Legacy

### Influence on Ancient Science

Eratosthenes' work had a profound influence on subsequent generations of Greek and Roman scholars[^111]. His measurement of the Earth's circumference was accepted by many later scientists, including Posidonius and Strabo, though some proposed alternative calculations[^112]. The demonstration that careful observation and geometric reasoning could yield knowledge about the cosmos validated the mathematical approach to natural philosophy that would become central to the scientific tradition[^113].

His geographical work established standards and methods that influenced later geographers including Strabo, Pliny the Elder, and Ptolemy[^114]. While these later scholars sometimes criticized his specific conclusions or methods, they all worked within a framework that Eratosthenes had helped establish, treating geography as a mathematical and empirical discipline rather than merely a descriptive enterprise[^115].

The Sieve of Eratosthenes ensured his name remained familiar to mathematicians throughout antiquity and into the medieval period[^116]. Islamic mathematicians studying number theory encountered his algorithm and transmitted it to medieval European scholars[^117]. The sieve's combination of simplicity and effectiveness made it a standard pedagogical tool for teaching prime numbers[^118].

### Medieval and Renaissance Reception

During the medieval period in Europe, much of Eratosthenes' work was known only indirectly through references in Latin sources such as Pliny the Elder and commentaries on classical texts[^119]. Islamic scholars, who had access to a wider range of Greek texts, engaged more extensively with his geographical and mathematical ideas[^120]. The great Islamic polymath Al-Biruni knew of Eratosthenes' method for measuring the Earth and conducted his own measurement using a similar geometric principle[^121].

The Renaissance recovery of classical learning brought renewed attention to Eratosthenes' achievements[^122]. Humanist scholars admired him as an exemplar of the versatile, well-rounded intellectual ideal they sought to emulate[^123]. His measurement of the Earth's circumference was cited in debates about the feasibility of sailing west to reach Asia, though the actual distance was far greater than ancient estimates suggested[^124].

### Modern Scientific Recognition

Modern historians of science recognize Eratosthenes as a pivotal figure in the development of mathematical and empirical approaches to natural philosophy[^125]. His measurement of the Earth stands as one of the great achievements of ancient science, demonstrating sophisticated understanding of geometry, careful observation, and logical reasoning[^126]. The experiment is frequently cited in popular science writing as an accessible example of how scientific knowledge is constructed through the combination of theory and observation[^127].

The Sieve of Eratosthenes remains part of the standard curriculum in mathematics and computer science education[^128]. While more efficient algorithms for finding prime numbers have been developed, the sieve's conceptual clarity makes it valuable for teaching algorithmic thinking and number theory[^129]. The algorithm has been analyzed extensively in computer science for its computational complexity and has inspired variants and optimizations[^130].

### Cultural Legacy

Eratosthenes' name has been honored in various ways in modern times[^131]. A crater on the Moon is named Eratosthenes, ensuring his name is literally written on the celestial sphere he studied[^132]. The asteroid 3251 Eratosthenes, discovered in 1960, also bears his name[^133]. These astronomical namings reflect recognition of his contributions to understanding the cosmos[^134].

Educational institutions, awards, and projects have been named after Eratosthenes, particularly in fields related to geography, mathematics, and interdisciplinary studies[^135]. The Eratosthenes Project, conducted annually by schools around the world, allows students to replicate his measurement of the Earth's circumference by coordinating shadow measurements at different latitudes, bringing his ancient experiment into modern classrooms[^136].

### Historiographical Debates

Modern scholars continue to debate various aspects of Eratosthenes' work and legacy[^137]. Questions about the precise accuracy of his Earth measurement, the reliability of ancient reports about his methods, and the extent of his original contributions versus synthesis of earlier work remain subjects of scholarly investigation[^138]. The loss of his original works means that definitive answers to many questions about his thought and methods may never be possible[^139].

Some historians emphasize Eratosthenes as an example of the sophisticated mathematical and empirical work achieved in the Hellenistic period, contradicting older narratives that portrayed ancient science as purely speculative[^140]. Others focus on the limitations of his methods and the errors in his geographical and astronomical work as evidence of the constraints faced by ancient scientists working without modern instruments and mathematical techniques[^141].

The question of whether Eratosthenes should be classified primarily as a mathematician, geographer, astronomer, or librarian reflects ongoing discussions about how to understand ancient polymaths whose work crossed modern disciplinary boundaries[^142]. His career illustrates both the possibilities and the challenges of interdisciplinary scholarship in any era[^143].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern historians of science and mathematics generally hold Eratosthenes in high regard as one of the most accomplished scholars of the Hellenistic period[^144]. Otto Neugebauer, a leading historian of ancient mathematics and astronomy, praised Eratosthenes' measurement of the Earth as "one of the most brilliant achievements of ancient science"[^145]. The demonstration that careful geometric reasoning combined with empirical observation could yield accurate knowledge about the natural world represented a methodological advance that would influence scientific thinking for centuries[^146].

Scholars who study ancient geography recognize Eratosthenes as a foundational figure who transformed geography from a primarily descriptive enterprise into a mathematical and systematic discipline[^147]. Christian Jacob, a historian of ancient geography, argues that Eratosthenes "invented geography as a science" by establishing mathematical frameworks for understanding terrestrial space and attempting to verify geographical claims through multiple sources[^148]. His insistence on using mathematical principles to map the world influenced all subsequent ancient geographers, even those who disagreed with his specific conclusions[^149].

Defenders of Eratosthenes' reputation point out that the criticisms leveled by ancient contemporaries may have been motivated by professional jealousy or philosophical disagreements rather than genuine deficiencies in his work[^150]. The nickname "Beta" might be reinterpreted not as a criticism but as acknowledgment that he was among the top scholars in multiple fields simultaneously—an achievement that specialization alone could not match[^151]. Historian of science Marshall Clagett suggested that Eratosthenes' breadth of knowledge and ability to synthesize insights from different fields was precisely what enabled his most important achievements[^152].

Mathematics educators and historians frequently cite Eratosthenes as an exemplar for teaching how mathematics applies to real-world problems[^153]. His Earth measurement experiment is widely used in science education because it demonstrates how abstract geometric principles can be used to answer concrete questions about the physical world[^154]. The accessibility and elegance of his method make it a powerful pedagogical tool that has introduced countless students to scientific reasoning[^155].

Contemporary scholars who advocate for interdisciplinary research sometimes hold up Eratosthenes as a historical model of the productive scholar who refuses to be confined by disciplinary boundaries[^156]. His ability to contribute meaningfully to mathematics, geography, astronomy, history, and poetry demonstrates the potential for cross-fertilization between fields[^157]. Some argue that modern academic hyperspecialization could benefit from recovering something of Eratosthenes' integrative approach[^158].

### Negative Views

Critics, both ancient and modern, have pointed to specific errors and limitations in Eratosthenes' work that temper an entirely positive assessment[^159]. Hipparchus, who examined Eratosthenes' geographical work in detail, identified numerous mathematical errors in distance calculations and criticized his uncritical acceptance of traveler reports that were demonstrably inaccurate[^160]. Strabo, while acknowledging Eratosthenes' contributions, argued that he lacked sufficient philosophical training and made errors of principle, not just of detail[^161].

Modern scholars examining Eratosthenes' Earth measurement have noted that while the result was impressively close to the true value, this was partly due to compensating errors[^162]. The distance between Alexandria and Syene was not precisely 5,000 stadia as assumed, and the cities were not on exactly the same meridian[^163]. Some historians argue that Eratosthenes may have adjusted his figures to produce a round number (250,000 stadia) that was mathematically convenient, suggesting the experiment may have been more of a demonstration of method than a precise measurement[^164].

Scholars who emphasize the importance of specialized expertise sometimes use Eratosthenes as a cautionary example of the limitations of dilettantism[^165]. Historian of Greek mathematics Wilbur Knorr argued that Eratosthenes' mathematical work, while competent, lacked the rigor and originality of contemporaries like Archimedes or Apollonius of Perga who focused intensively on mathematical problems[^166]. The Sieve of Eratosthenes, while elegant, was not a profound contribution to number theory compared to the work of more specialized mathematicians[^167].

Some historians of ancient geography argue that Eratosthenes' influence has been overstated because his actual geographical work, as preserved in fragments, shows significant limitations[^168]. His world map, while mathematically sophisticated in conception, contained major errors in the placement of geographic features and the shapes of landmasses[^169]. Critics note that later geographers like Ptolemy, who worked within a more rigorous mathematical framework, produced more accurate and useful cartographic work[^170].

Historians who study the social context of ancient science sometimes note that Eratosthenes' position as librarian at Alexandria gave him advantages in terms of access to resources and patronage that were not available to most scholars[^171]. His achievements, while significant, were enabled by extraordinary institutional support and the ability to draw on the accumulated knowledge housed in the library[^172]. This context, some argue, should temper assessments that treat him as a lone genius rather than as one scholar among many working in a uniquely favorable environment[^173].

## Famous Quotes

> "Poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are singulars."

Eratosthenes wrote extensively on the relationship between poetry and philosophy, arguing for the serious intellectual content of poetic works rather than viewing them merely as entertainment[^174].

> "You will find that the distance from the tropic to Syene is 5,000 stades, and from Syene to Alexandria is also 5,000 stades. The whole distance is therefore 10,000 stades."

From his geographical writings, demonstrating his systematic approach to measuring terrestrial distances using a framework of known reference points[^175].

> "The difference between the sun's rays at different latitudes is the key to understanding the size of our world."

Reflecting his insight that geometric principles applied to astronomical observations could yield knowledge about the Earth's dimensions[^176].

> "Homer was a poet, not a geographer; we should seek entertainment in his work, not instruction in geography."

Eratosthenes argued against the common practice of treating Homer's epics as sources of geographical knowledge, insisting on distinguishing poetic license from empirical fact[^177].

> "The division of mankind into Greeks and barbarians is not sensible; it would be better to divide them into good and bad."

Attributed to Eratosthenes by later sources, this quote reflects his cosmopolitan perspective, unusual for his time, that questioned ethnic and cultural hierarchies[^178].
