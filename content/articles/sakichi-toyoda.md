## Summary

Sakichi Toyoda was a Japanese inventor and industrialist known as the 'King of Japanese Inventors.' He invented the automatic power loom and founded Toyoda Automatic Loom Works. He developed the concept of 'jidoka' (automation with a human touch), which became a cornerstone of the Toyota Production System. The sale of his loom patents to a British company funded his son Kiichiro's establishment of Toyota Motor Corporation.
