## Summary
Ricky Donnell Ross, known as 'Freeway Rick Ross,' was an American drug trafficker who was a central figure in the crack cocaine epidemic in Los Angeles during the 1980s. He reportedly made $600 million in drug sales before his arrest and imprisonment. He was released in 2009.

## Early Life
Born January 26, 1960, in Troup, Texas, and raised in South Central Los Angeles. He was functionally illiterate and had a tennis scholarship revoked due to his inability to read. He turned to drug dealing after meeting Nicaraguan drug supplier Oscar Danilo Blandón. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Ross became one of the largest crack cocaine dealers in Los Angeles during the 1980s crack epidemic. At his peak, he reportedly moved $3 million worth of crack per day. His supply chain connected Nicaraguan suppliers (allegedly linked to the CIA-Contra affair) to the streets of South Central LA. His operations contributed significantly to the devastating crack epidemic. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Ross was arrested multiple times. In 1996, he was sentenced to life in prison after a sting operation. His sentence was later reduced to 20 years after revelations about government involvement in the drug supply chain. He was released in 2009. He has since become a speaker and community activist.
