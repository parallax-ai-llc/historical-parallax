## Summary

Heike Kamerlingh Onnes was a Dutch physicist who won the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on the properties of matter at low temperatures. He was the first to liquefy helium in 1908, reaching temperatures near absolute zero. In 1911, he discovered superconductivity — the complete disappearance of electrical resistance in certain metals at very low temperatures.
