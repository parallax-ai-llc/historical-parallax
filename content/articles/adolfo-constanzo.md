## Summary
Adolfo de Jesús Constanzo was a Cuban-American serial killer and cult leader who practiced a syncretic religion involving human sacrifice in Mexico. He led a drug-trafficking cult in Matamoros that murdered at least 23 people. He ordered his own execution by a follower during a police raid in 1989.

## Early Life
Born November 1, 1962, in Miami, Florida, to a Cuban immigrant mother. He was introduced to various Afro-Caribbean religions as a child. He traveled to Mexico and became involved in drug trafficking, using religious ritual to attract cartel clients who believed his ceremonies provided supernatural protection. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Constanzo and his cult, operating near Matamoros, Tamaulipas, kidnapped and sacrificed victims in rituals blending Palo Mayombe and Santería. Victims included rivals, strangers, and American college student Mark Kilroy. Their ranch contained a cauldron with decomposed human remains used in rituals. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
After Kilroy's disappearance triggered an international investigation, police raided the cult's ranch in April 1989 and found evidence of at least 15 murders. Constanzo fled to Mexico City. Cornered by police on May 6, 1989, he ordered follower Alvaro de León to shoot him. Several cult members were convicted. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
