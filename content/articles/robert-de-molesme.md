## Summary

Robert de Molesme was a French Benedictine abbot who founded the Cistercian Order at Cîteaux in 1098. He sought to return to a stricter observance of the Rule of Saint Benedict. The Cistercian reform became one of the most successful monastic movements in medieval Europe, eventually encompassing over 700 monasteries. He later returned to Molesme, while the Cistercian movement continued under his successors.
