## Summary
Jack the Ripper is the pseudonym given to an unidentified serial killer active in the impoverished Whitechapel district of London in 1888. The killer is attributed with at least five murders of women, known as the "canonical five," though additional victims are suspected. The case is the most famous unsolved murder mystery in history and has generated countless theories about the killer's identity.

## Early Life
The identity of Jack the Ripper has never been established, and therefore nothing definitive is known about his early life. Over 100 suspects have been proposed over the years, including Prince Albert Victor, painter Walter Sickert, Polish immigrant Aaron Kosminski, and surgeon William Gull. Despite advances in forensic science, including DNA analysis of contemporaneous evidence, the killer's identity remains one of history's greatest mysteries. [^1]

## Criminal Career
The murders attributed to Jack the Ripper took place between August and November 1888 in the Whitechapel area of London's East End. The five canonical victims — Mary Ann Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes, and Mary Jane Kelly — were all women involved in sex work. The murders were characterized by deep throat slashing and progressive abdominal mutilation, suggesting anatomical knowledge. Letters purportedly from the killer were sent to police and the press, including the famous "Dear Boss" letter that gave the killer his name. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Jack the Ripper was never caught. The murders appeared to cease after November 9, 1888, with the killing of Mary Jane Kelly, the most mutilated victim. Various theories suggest the killer died, was institutionalized, emigrated, or was imprisoned for other crimes. The Metropolitan Police investigated over 2,000 suspects and interviewed approximately 300 people. The case officially remains open. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- The case led to significant social reform in London's East End, improving conditions for the poor [^4]
- Drove early development of criminal investigation techniques and forensic medicine
- Public outrage over the murders drew attention to the dire poverty in Whitechapel
- Led to reforms in policing methods and the establishment of modern criminal profiling

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered at least five women in brutal fashion [^5]
- Exploited and targeted the most vulnerable women in one of London's poorest districts
- The sensationalized media coverage contributed to anti-immigrant sentiment in the East End
- The killer's evasion of justice has been romanticized, overshadowing victims' humanity
- The mystery has fueled a cottage industry that often sensationalizes violence against women
