## Overview

The Russian Revolution of 1917 was one of the most consequential events of the 20th century. It comprised two distinct revolutions: the February Revolution (March in Western calendar), which overthrew Tsar Nicholas II and ended 300 years of Romanov rule; and the October Revolution (November), in which Vladimir Lenin's Bolsheviks seized power from the Provisional Government. The revolutions were fueled by war weariness, food shortages, and demands for reform. The result was the world's first communist state—the Soviet Union—which would shape global politics for the next 74 years through the Cold War and beyond.
