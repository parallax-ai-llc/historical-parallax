## Summary

Eunice Newton Foote was an American scientist who was the first person to document the greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide in 1856, three years before John Tyndall's better-known experiments. She demonstrated that CO2 and water vapor absorb heat and proposed that changes in atmospheric CO2 could change climate. Her contribution was overlooked for over 150 years.
