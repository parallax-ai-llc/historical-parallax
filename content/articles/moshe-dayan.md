## Summary

Moshe Dayan (1915-1981) was an Israeli military leader and politician who became one of the most recognizable figures in Israeli history, known for his distinctive black eye patch and complex legacy. As Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (1953-1958), he planned the successful 1956 Sinai Campaign, and as Defense Minister during the 1967 Six-Day War, he helped achieve one of Israel's most decisive military victories[^1][^2]. Later serving as Foreign Minister, he became a chief architect of the 1978 Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt[^3]. However, his career was marred by the 1973 Yom Kippur War debacle, controversies over reprisal operations against Palestinians, and illegal archaeological looting that damaged his reputation[^4][^5].

---

## Early Life and Background

Moshe Dayan was born on May 20, 1915, at Kibbutz Degania Alef, near the Sea of Galilee in Palestine, then part of the Ottoman Empire[^6]. He was the second child born at Degania, Israel's first kibbutz, making him one of the earliest native-born Sabras[^7]. His parents, Shmuel and Devorah Dayan, were Ukrainian Jewish immigrants from Zhashkiv who had come to Palestine as pioneers[^8]. He was named Moshe after Moshe Barsky, the first member of the kibbutz to be killed in an Arab attack, foreshadowing the violent conflicts that would define his life[^9].

Shortly after his birth, Dayan's family moved to Nahalal, the first moshav (cooperative farming village) established in Palestine[^10]. Growing up in this agricultural community shaped Dayan's character and worldview profoundly. He received his elementary education at the local school in Nahalal and later attended the Agricultural School there, even though it was originally designated for girls[^11]. This rural upbringing gave him an intimate knowledge of the land and its people.

Dayan grew up speaking both Hebrew and Arabic fluently, which gave him unique insights into both Jewish and Arab cultures in Palestine[^12]. When he was eighteen, in 1933, he studied mathematics, Hebrew, and literature in Tel Aviv, though his formal education was limited compared to other Israeli leaders of his generation[^13]. His real education would come through military service and the harsh realities of life in a contested land.

At the remarkably young age of fourteen, Dayan joined the Haganah, the illegal Jewish defense force operating under British rule[^14]. This early commitment to armed defense reflected the precarious situation of Jewish settlements in Palestine during the 1920s and 1930s, constantly under threat from Arab attacks. The young Dayan quickly absorbed the ethos that Jewish survival in Palestine would ultimately depend on military strength rather than diplomacy or British protection.

## Rise to Power

Dayan's military career began in earnest in 1937 when he became one of the first volunteers for the Special Night Squads, a joint British-Jewish counter-insurgency unit established by Captain Orde Wingate during the 1936-1939 Arab revolt[^15]. Wingate personally selected his men, including Dayan and Yigal Allon, training them in small mobile striking units, ambush techniques, and night fighting[^16]. Wingate's philosophy of "taking the war to the enemy" profoundly influenced Dayan and became part of Israeli military doctrine[^17]. Dayan would later cite Wingate as one of his military heroes, and the British officer's aggressive tactics shaped his entire strategic thinking.

In 1939, the British authorities arrested Dayan for his involvement with the Haganah and imprisoned him until 1941[^18]. However, when World War II threatened British positions in the Middle East, the authorities released Haganah members to help fight Vichy French forces in Syria. On June 8, 1941, during the Allied invasion of Syria, Dayan experienced the event that would define his physical appearance for the rest of his life. While on the roof of a captured Vichy police station using binoculars to scan French positions, a sniper's bullet struck the binoculars from several hundred yards away, propelling metal and glass fragments into his left eye[^19]. Six hours passed before he could be evacuated, and doctors could not save the eye. The damage to the extraocular muscles prevented him from being fitted with a glass eye, forcing him to wear the black eye patch that became his iconic trademark[^20].

In his autobiography, Dayan revealed the psychological impact of this injury: "I was ready to make any effort and stand any suffering, if only I could get rid of my black eye patch. The attention it drew was intolerable to me. I preferred to shut myself up at home, doing anything, rather than encounter the reactions of people wherever I went."[^21] Yet paradoxically, the black patch he despised became a symbol of Israeli military prowess and made him instantly recognizable worldwide.

During Israel's 1948 War of Independence, Dayan commanded forces in the Jerusalem area, one of the most challenging theaters of the conflict[^22]. In 1949, he participated in armistice negotiations between Jordan and Israel, gaining his first experience in diplomacy[^23]. His success in these roles brought him to the attention of Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, who became his mentor and political patron. On December 6, 1953, at age thirty-eight, Dayan was appointed Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces, the youngest person to hold this position[^24].

## Major Achievements

As Chief of Staff from 1953 to 1958, Dayan transformed the IDF into a formidable fighting force and established military doctrines that would shape Israeli strategy for decades. He developed a policy of aggressive reprisal raids in response to fedayeen attacks, believing that overwhelming retaliation would deter future attacks[^25]. In 1955, he gave a lecture entitled "Reprisal raids as a means for ensuring peace," which became known as the "Dayan doctrine" of deterrence through harsh reprisals[^26]. While controversial, this approach reflected his belief that Israel could only survive through demonstrated military superiority.

Dayan's most significant military achievement as Chief of Staff came during the 1956 Sinai Campaign (Suez Crisis). With the help of Shimon Peres, he forged an alliance between Israeli and French interests, convincing France to supply weapons based on their common opposition to Egyptian President Nasser[^27]. Dayan personally commanded Israeli forces when they invaded the Sinai Peninsula on October 29, 1956[^28]. Facing an Egyptian army at half strength and assisted by French air strikes, Israeli forces conquered the Sinai in a matter of days, with Dayan's forces seizing the strategic Mitla Pass and achieving decisive victories throughout the peninsula[^29]. The campaign resulted in 189 Israeli deaths compared to an estimated 1,030 Egyptian deaths, and enabled Israel to secure freedom of navigation through the Straits of Tiran[^30]. This military success established Dayan's reputation as a brilliant tactical commander.

After leaving the military in 1958, Dayan entered politics. In 1959, he was elected to the Knesset (Parliament) as a member of Mapai, part of the Israel Labour Party coalition, and was appointed Minister of Agriculture by Ben-Gurion[^31]. However, his greatest political role came in June 1967. As war with Israel's Arab neighbors appeared imminent, public pressure mounted for Dayan's appointment as Defense Minister. On June 1, 1967, he was brought into the government to boost public confidence[^32].

Together with Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin, Dayan directed operations during the Six-Day War (June 5-10, 1967)[^33]. The Israeli cabinet ordered a preemptive strike against the Egyptian air force on June 5, destroying three hundred Russian-built planes, most on the ground. Fifty Syrian MiGs were destroyed, and Jordan's entire air force of twenty planes was eliminated, with Israel losing only twenty-six aircraft, all to antiaircraft fire[^34]. Although Dayan had not participated in most of the pre-war planning, he personally oversaw the capture of East Jerusalem during the June 5-7 fighting[^35]. On June 8, he bypassed both the Prime Minister and the Chief of the General Staff in ordering the Israeli army to attack and capture the Golan Heights from Syria[^36].

The Six-Day War resulted in spectacular territorial gains for Israel, tripling its controlled territory and establishing Dayan as a national hero. His leadership during this conflict made him one of the most celebrated military figures in Israeli history. Following the war, as military governor of Jerusalem and the occupied territories, Dayan established policies toward Arab Palestinians, meeting hundreds of Arab leaders and attempting to persuade them that cooperation with Israel was preferable to confrontation[^37].

Later in his career, Dayan played a crucial role in peacemaking. As Foreign Minister under Prime Minister Menachem Begin, he became one of the chief architects of the Camp David Accords in 1978[^38]. Dayan understood that "the future is with Egypt. If Egypt is out of the conflict, there will be no more war."[^39] During the intense negotiations, he engaged in frank discussions with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and helped bridge gaps between the parties[^40]. The accords led to the Egypt-Israel peace treaty signed in March 1979, the first peace agreement between Israel and an Arab state[^41]. This achievement demonstrated Dayan's evolution from warrior to statesman.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Dayan's career was marked by significant controversies that have complicated his historical legacy. The most devastating blow came during the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. When Egypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on October 6 (Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism), Israel was caught almost completely unprepared[^42]. As Defense Minister, Dayan bore primary responsibility for this failure. In the hours preceding the war, he chose not to order full mobilization or a preemptive strike, assuming Israel would win easily even if attacked and not wanting Israel to appear as the aggressor to avoid losing U.S. support[^43].

Recent scholarship based on declassified documents provides a nuanced view: Dayan's professional military opinions were generally sound given available information, but he allowed his subordinates to see his disturbed emotions and shook their confidence—a critical failure of leadership[^44]. Dayan personally blamed himself for not mobilizing the army and felt his decisions had caused the disaster[^45]. Public outrage was intense. Captain Motti Ashkenazi began a one-man protest demanding Dayan's resignation and calling for accountability for what was termed "The Fiasco"[^46]. Though the Agranat Commission investigating the war largely protected Dayan and Prime Minister Golda Meir, public pressure eventually brought down Meir's government in 1974, and when Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister, he excluded Dayan from his cabinet[^47].

Dayan's reprisal operations in the 1950s remain highly controversial. In 1950, he authorized the Israeli Air Force to strafe shepherds and their herds in Gaza area and Beit Govrin[^48]. On October 20, 1951, Israeli forces destroyed houses and an ice factory in eastern Gaza City, killing and injuring dozens[^49]. In July 1953, Dayan helped establish Unit 101, which specialized in night-time cross-border retaliation raids[^50]. The unit's first official operation attacked the Bureij Refugee Camp on August 28, 1953, killing 20 refugees[^51].

Most notoriously, Dayan was one of the main architects of the Qibya massacre on the night of October 14-15, 1953, in response to the killing of three Israeli civilians[^52]. A force commanded by Ariel Sharon attacked the Jordanian village of Qibya, killing 69 villagers, two-thirds of them women and children[^53]. British military observer Glubb Pasha wrote that the objective of Israeli military strategy seemed to "be merely to kill Arabs indiscriminately," while Dayan defended it as an "eye for an eye" approach[^54]. In 1955, Dayan approved Operation Black Arrow, a retaliatory raid into Gaza that killed thirty-eight Egyptian soldiers[^55].

After the 1967 war, Dayan's policies toward Palestinians in the occupied territories drew criticism. In September 1967, he told senior staff that some 200,000 Palestinian Arabs had left the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and indicated they should not undermine the causes of this emigration[^56]. He established the special regime in the West Bank that created the semi-permanent occupation[^57]. However, in his final years, Dayan showed growing awareness that this occupation was not sustainable and had to be replaced with something more aligned with international norms and long-term Israeli interests[^58].

This evolving perspective led to his resignation from Begin's government in October 1979, when he complained he had been frozen out of West Bank and Gaza Palestinian autonomy talks because he disagreed with Begin's more hawkish settlement policies[^59]. His letter to Begin noted he had voted against the Likud majority on expropriation of Arab land for Israeli settlements[^60]. This demonstrated Dayan's pragmatic evolution from hardline military commander to advocate for territorial compromise.

Perhaps his most personally damaging controversy involved archaeological looting. Dayan conducted illegal excavations and robbery at 35 archaeological sites, including Tel el Hesi and Azur[^61]. He was arrested in 1965 for looting at Azur but faced no serious consequences[^62]. He used army vehicles, personnel, and even helicopters to plunder antiquities, including inscribed stelae from Serabit el Khadem in Sinai[^63]. His military authority gave him unrestricted access to excavation sites, particularly in occupied territories after 1967[^64]. Upon catching antiquities thieves in the Hebron Hills, he purchased their findings and encouraged them to continue excavating, contributing to widespread illicit excavations[^65].

When questioned in the Knesset in 1971, Dayan claimed to be "saving" antiquities from destruction, though no such threat existed[^66]. Supported by the establishment, he never faced justice despite being caught red-handed at least four times[^67]. After his death, his widow sold his collection of more than 800 artifacts spanning 7,500 years to the Israel Museum for between $1-2 million[^68]. Scholars have noted that Dayan became a negative model for others and damaged the cause of Israeli archaeology as a whole[^69].

## Personal Life

Moshe Dayan married Ruth Dayan in 1935, and they remained married for thirty-six years[^70]. Together they had three children: Yael Dayan, who became a novelist best known for her book "My Father, His Daughter" about her relationship with her father; Assi Dayan, who became an actor and movie director; and Ehud Dayan[^71][^72]. The marriage was troubled by Dayan's numerous extramarital affairs, which Ruth tolerated along with their children for decades[^73].

In 1971, Ruth and Moshe divorced after thirty-six years of marriage[^74]. In 1973, Dayan married Rachel Korem, a decision that deeply angered his sons and led to their disinheritance[^75]. His son Ehud, cut out of his father's will, wrote a book months after Dayan's death that was highly critical, mocking his military, writing, and political skills, calling him a philanderer, and accusing him of greed[^76]. This bitter family division revealed the personal costs of Dayan's driven, often ruthless personality.

The Dayan family was haunted by unspoken depression, leading Dayan's sister to take her own life and his sons to develop crippling drug addictions[^77]. Despite becoming Israel's most recognizable family and wielding enormous influence, the Dayans paid a heavy personal price for their prominence. Ruth Dayan, his first wife, went on to become a storied social activist and lived until 2022, dying at age 103[^78].

Dayan's personality was complex and often contradictory. He was known for his blunt, forthright manner, once telling President Sadat during Camp David negotiations: "If anyone has told you, Mr. President, that any Israeli government can get out of the Sinai settlements, they're deluding you"—a statement that nearly derailed the peace talks[^79]. This characteristic directness could be both an asset and a liability in diplomatic contexts.

His passion for archaeology, while criminally indulged, reflected a genuine fascination with the ancient history of the land he fought to control. His fluency in Arabic and his attempts to engage with Palestinian leaders showed a recognition of the complexity of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, even as his military policies often exacerbated it.

## Legacy

Moshe Dayan died on October 16, 1981, in Tel Aviv from a massive heart attack, though he had been battling colon cancer since being diagnosed in May 1979[^80][^81]. He was sixty-six years old and was buried in Nahalal, the moshav where he was raised[^82]. His death marked the end of an era in Israeli history, as he was the last of the founding generation of military leaders who had established and defended the state.

Dayan's legacy remains deeply contested in Israel and internationally. He transformed the Israel Defense Forces into one of the world's most effective military organizations and helped secure Israel's survival during critical moments in its early history. His planning of the 1956 Sinai Campaign and leadership during the 1967 Six-Day War represented military achievements of historic significance. The capture of the Western Wall and the reunification of Jerusalem under his watch created enduring symbolic importance for Jews worldwide.

His evolution from warrior to peacemaker demonstrated intellectual flexibility rare among military leaders. His work on the Camp David Accords showed that he could apply the same strategic thinking to diplomacy that had made him successful in warfare. His statement that "If you want to make peace, you don't talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies" encapsulated this pragmatic approach[^83].

However, his legacy is inseparable from the darker aspects of his career. The reprisal operations he authorized in the 1950s killed many civilians and set precedents for disproportionate responses to Palestinian attacks. His occupation policies after 1967 created a framework that persists in modified form today, contributing to ongoing Israeli-Palestinian tensions. The Yom Kippur War failure represents one of the most serious intelligence and military disasters in Israeli history.

His archaeological looting damaged both his personal reputation and the broader cause of preserving cultural heritage in the region. This aspect of his legacy is particularly painful given the ongoing controversies over cultural heritage and property rights in Israel-Palestine. The fact that he used military power to facilitate personal enrichment through antiquities theft reveals a troubling abuse of authority.

Within Israel, opinions on Dayan remain sharply divided. Many Israelis, particularly older generations and those on the political right, remember him as a brilliant military commander who helped ensure Israeli survival during existential threats. His black eye patch remains an iconic image of Israeli determination and resilience. Books of military history citing the greatest military leaders of all time include Dayan as Israel's only representative[^84].

Others, particularly on the political left and among Palestinians, view him as an architect of occupation and a perpetrator of violence against civilians. Palestinian sources describe him as a "killer of Palestinians" and document his role in displacement and repression[^85]. The complexity of his legacy reflects the broader complexities and contradictions of Israeli history itself.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Military historians and strategic thinkers have offered substantial praise for Dayan's military acumen. British military thinker Richard Simpkin described him as "a great military leader, head and shoulders above all his contemporaries"[^86]. Scholar Frank Hoffman assessed that Dayan was "a creative, adaptive and extremely focused strategist who, despite the shock of the 1973 Yom Kippur, belongs on a short list of history's top military minds for study"[^87].

Eliot A. Cohen praised recent scholarly work on Dayan, noting that it presents "Dayan the strategist, with faults, to be sure, but also tremendous virtues and a remarkable record of success at all levels of war"[^88]. This balanced assessment recognizes both his strategic brilliance and his failures, attempting to evaluate his military contributions objectively rather than through the lens of later controversies.

Supporters emphasize his role in securing Israeli independence and survival during the vulnerable early years of statehood. They note that the harsh security environment of the 1950s and 1960s demanded aggressive military policies, and that Dayan's deterrence doctrine, while brutal, may have prevented even worse outcomes. His willingness to make peace with Egypt is seen as evidence of strategic vision and flexibility.

His admirers also point to his deep knowledge of both Hebrew and Arabic culture, his attempts to engage constructively with Palestinian leaders after 1967, and his eventual recognition that permanent occupation was unsustainable. They argue that he evolved intellectually throughout his career, becoming more nuanced and diplomatic even while maintaining core commitments to Israeli security.

Historian Azar Gat praised recent biographical work as "an original, well-balanced and comprehensive assessment of Dayan's military career, which avoids both pitfalls of one-sided adulation and superficial criticism"[^89]. This suggests that serious scholarship is moving toward more nuanced evaluation that acknowledges both achievements and failures.

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize Dayan's role in establishing patterns of excessive violence against Palestinians that continue to shape the conflict. His reprisal doctrine killed hundreds of civilians and established collective punishment as a standard Israeli military practice. The Qibya massacre in particular stands as a war crime for which he bore command responsibility. Palestinian historians and activists view him as emblematic of Israeli militarism and occupation.

The Yom Kippur War failure has permanently damaged his reputation among military professionals. Critics argue that his overconfidence, born of the 1967 victory, led to catastrophic complacency. His emotional breakdown during the early stages of the war raised questions about his psychological suitability for high command during crises. The nearly 3,000 Israeli deaths in that war are partly attributable to his failure to prepare adequately.

Historians identify what they call his "Achilles' heel": "his insensitivity to historical undercurrents and his inability to see the larger picture, shortcomings that ultimately led to his political and military decline"[^90]. This critique suggests that while tactically brilliant, Dayan lacked the broader strategic vision necessary for long-term success.

His archaeological crimes have drawn particular condemnation from heritage scholars. They note that he robbed and conducted illegal excavations in plain sight, used military resources for personal enrichment, lied to parliament, and faced no accountability despite being caught multiple times[^91]. His actions contributed to widespread antiquities looting and damaged professional archaeology in Israel and the occupied territories. The fact that his stolen collection now resides in the Israel Museum rather than in a criminal evidence locker symbolizes the impunity he enjoyed.

Critics also point to his personal character flaws—the serial adultery, the treatment of his children, the apparent greed in archaeological collecting—as evidence of moral failings that extended beyond professional controversies. His son's bitter denunciations after his death reveal the personal wreckage left by his ambition and self-centeredness.

Scholars increasingly describe him as "Israel's controversial hero," emphasizing that the controversy is inseparable from the heroism[^92]. Historian Michael Oren noted: "the more I learned about him, the less I felt I knew about him"[^93]. This enigmatic quality may reflect genuine complexity, or it may indicate fundamental contradictions in his character that resist coherent interpretation.
