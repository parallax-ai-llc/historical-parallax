## Summary

Collis Potter Huntington (1821-1900) was one of America's most powerful and controversial railroad tycoons during the Gilded Age. As one of the "Big Four" who built the Central Pacific Railroad, he played a pivotal role in creating the first transcontinental railroad, completed in 1869. Rising from poverty in rural Connecticut to amass a fortune exceeding $70 million, Huntington became synonymous with both industrial achievement and corporate corruption. His aggressive lobbying tactics, documented bribery of congressmen, and ruthless business practices made him one of the most hated men in America, yet his railroad empire connected the nation and transformed the American West.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Collis Potter Huntington was born on October 22, 1821, in Harwinton, Connecticut, in an area known as Poverty Hollow—a name that aptly described his family's circumstances.[^3] He was the sixth of nine children born to William H. Huntington and Elizabeth Vincent Huntington, who struggled to make ends meet on their 30-acre farm. William operated a fulling mill and shingle mill in addition to farming, but none of these ventures prospered.[^4]

The Huntington family's poverty became so dire that in 1834, town selectmen removed Collis and his older brother from the family home and placed them with local farmers—a common practice for impoverished families in 19th-century New England.[^5] Despite irregular schooling at the local one-room schoolhouse, young Collis displayed remarkable business acumen and determination to escape his circumstances.

At age fourteen, Huntington left home to work as an itinerant peddler, traveling through New York and neighboring states selling watches, jewelry, and other goods.[^6] This early experience proved formative, teaching him negotiation skills, market awareness, and the value of understanding customer needs. During one journey, he visited Newport News, Virginia, and was struck by the harbor's potential—a vision he would realize decades later.[^7]

In his early twenties, Huntington partnered with his brother Solon to open a successful hardware store in Oneonta, New York. The venture demonstrated his sharp business instincts and ability to identify profitable opportunities. In September 1844, he married Elizabeth Stoddard, a distant cousin from Cornwall, Connecticut.[^8] The marriage would last nearly forty years until Elizabeth's death from cancer in 1883.

When news of the California Gold Rush reached the East Coast in 1849, Huntington saw opportunity not in mining gold but in supplying miners. Unlike thousands who rushed to the goldfields only to go broke, the 27-year-old businessman sold his Oneonta interests and headed west with merchandise to sell.[^9]

---

## Rise to Power

Huntington arrived in California in 1849 via the Isthmus of Panama, bringing with him goods to sell to miners. Rather than joining the frenzied search for gold, he opened a store in Sacramento selling mining equipment and supplies—a decision that proved far more lucrative than prospecting.[^10] While most forty-niners ended up broke, Huntington steadily amassed capital through shrewd merchandising.

In 1855, Huntington formed a partnership with Mark Hopkins, establishing Huntington & Hopkins Company, importers and dealers in hardware.[^11] The firm, located at 54 K Street in Sacramento (later renumbered 220-222 K Street), became one of the largest hardware businesses on the West Coast. The partnership between the gregarious, aggressive Huntington and the quiet, meticulous Hopkins proved remarkably effective, with Hopkins managing the books while Huntington handled procurement and sales.[^12]

The turning point came in 1860 when civil engineer Theodore Dehone Judah began promoting his vision of a transcontinental railroad. Judah, who had conducted surveys through the Sierra Nevada mountains, believed he had found a viable route but needed investors.[^13] After failing to raise funds in San Francisco, Judah came to Sacramento and, in 1861, met with Huntington, Hopkins, Leland Stanford, and Charles Crocker—four merchants who would become known as the "Big Four."

On the second floor of the Huntington-Hopkins hardware store, these four ambitious men conceived their plan for the Central Pacific Railroad.[^14] On June 28, 1861, the Central Pacific Rail Road of California was incorporated, with Stanford as president, Huntington as vice president, Hopkins as treasurer, and Judah as chief engineer.[^15] Each of the Big Four initially invested approximately $1,500—a modest sum that would grow into one of history's greatest fortunes.

Huntington's role in the partnership quickly became clear: he would serve as the company's lobbyist and procurement agent in Washington, D.C., and on the East Coast. From 1862 onward, he spent most of his time in New York and Washington, working to secure favorable legislation, government bonds, and land grants while purchasing rails, locomotives, and equipment for construction.[^16]

The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862, and its amendment in 1864, provided crucial government support through bonds and land grants for each mile of track completed. Huntington proved masterful at navigating—and manipulating—the political process to maximize these benefits.[^17]

## Major Achievements

### The Transcontinental Railroad

Huntington's greatest achievement was his central role in completing America's first transcontinental railroad. Construction of the Central Pacific began in 1863, with the company building eastward from Sacramento while the Union Pacific built westward from Omaha.[^18] Huntington worked tirelessly from his base in New York and Washington to secure financing, purchase equipment, and lobby Congress for favorable terms.

The construction faced enormous challenges: crossing the Sierra Nevada mountains, securing adequate labor, and maintaining sufficient capital. When white laborers proved scarce and unreliable, construction superintendent Charles Crocker, at Huntington's approval, began hiring Chinese workers in 1865.[^19] By 1868, approximately 12,000 Chinese laborers—comprising at least 80% of the Central Pacific workforce—were employed on the railroad. Huntington recognized their value, acknowledging that "without them it would be impossible to complete the western portion of this great national enterprise within the time required by the Acts of Congress."[^20]

In April 1869, Huntington met with Grenville Dodge, chief engineer of the Union Pacific, and Congressman Sam Hooper to determine where the two railroads would meet. They agreed on Promontory Summit, Utah.[^21] On May 10, 1869, before a crowd of up to 1,000 people, the tracks of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific joined, creating the transcontinental railroad. While Stanford received publicity for driving the ceremonial golden spike, Huntington's behind-the-scenes negotiations made the completion possible.[^22]

### The Southern Pacific Empire

Not content with the Central Pacific, Huntington and his partners formed the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1865, constructing rail lines through southern California and across the Southwest to New Orleans.[^23] Huntington worked to expand the Southern Pacific into a 9,600-mile network that became the foundation of rail service in California and provided the western link for a southern transcontinental route.[^24]

His rivalry with Stanford intensified during the 1880s, particularly after Stanford pursued a political career, winning election to the U.S. Senate in 1885 by defeating Huntington's friend A.A. Sargent.[^25] The two men disagreed fundamentally on business strategy and political involvement. In 1890, Huntington succeeded in having Stanford replaced as president of the Southern Pacific, consolidating his control over the railroad empire.[^26]

### The Chesapeake & Ohio Railway

Recognizing the potential he had observed decades earlier, Huntington took control of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway in the 1870s. He directed the C&O's Peninsula Extension in 1881-82, opening a pathway for West Virginia bituminous coal to reach the harbor at Hampton Roads for export.[^27] The railroad reached from Richmond, Virginia, to the Ohio River by 1873, with construction employing more than 7,000 men at a cost exceeding $15 million.[^28]

The new railroad facilities resulted in expansion of the former small town of Guyandotte, West Virginia, into part of a new city named Huntington in his honor.[^29] The Chesapeake & Ohio became a major force in opening the coalfields of southern West Virginia and provided economic development to the region.

### Newport News Development

Huntington transformed Newport News, Virginia, from a rural area into a major port and shipbuilding center. He developed Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, which became one of America's premier shipyards, and was instrumental in the incorporation of Newport News as an independent city.[^30] His motto for the shipyard captured his philosophy: "We Shall Build Good Ships Here; At A Profit If We Can, At A Loss If We Must, But Always Good Ships."[^31]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Colton Letters Scandal

The most damaging revelation of Huntington's corrupt practices came in 1883 when litigation following the death of David D. Colton opened his files, exposing hundreds of letters between Huntington and Colton detailing bribes, payoffs, and lobbying schemes.[^32] The Huntington-Colton letters were published in the New York Sun on December 29-30, 1883, revealing Huntington to be "an active, profane, and cynical promoter of his companies" with eagerness to use money to bribe congressmen.[^33]

The letters provided explicit evidence of corruption, showing Huntington sprinkling money around the Capitol like "the Union Pacific's man in Washington, Oakes Ames."[^34] He donated thousands of dollars to political campaigns, retained legislators as attorneys, and put lobbyists on the Central Pacific payroll. The revelations made him one of the most hated railroad men in the country.[^35]

### Congressional Investigations

In 1873, when Congressional investigators requested Central Pacific financial records, Huntington regretfully informed them that the books, though "All Right," had been destroyed when the company moved offices—a convenient claim that prevented scrutiny of the company's finances.[^36]

The United States Pacific Railway Commission investigated Huntington and Stanford in 1887 to determine whether they had used bribery to obtain favorable railroad legislation.[^37] Huntington testified before the commission in San Francisco on July 25, 1887. While the charges of bribery were never formally proved in court, the testimony and evidence painted a clear picture of systematic corruption.[^38]

Remarkably, Huntington was such an adroit lobbyist that he could obtain preferential legislation even while being investigated by Congress.[^39] He would never be punished for distributing favors, demonstrating the limits of Gilded Age reform efforts.

### The "Robber Baron" Label

Historian Matthew Josephson's influential 1934 book "The Robber Barons" prominently featured Huntington, cementing his reputation as a symbol of Gilded Age greed and corruption.[^40] Gladwin Hill of the New York Times wrote that Huntington and his fellow investors "served mainly as a facade of respectability for some of the greatest ravaging of the public purse and systematic political corruption on record," with Huntington becoming "a prime practitioner."[^41]

Editor Ambrose Bierce famously referred to Huntington as "one of the surviving 36 of the Forty Thieves," criticizing his leadership of the railroad "Octopus" that charged excessive rates and exploited California farmers.[^42] Huntington "came to symbolize the greed and corruption of late-nineteenth-century business," with historians long casting him "as the state's most despicable villain."[^43]

### Ruthless Business Practices

Of the Big Four, Huntington had a reputation for being the most ruthless in pursuing railroad business interests.[^44] His experience as a traveling salesman and merchant had created "a master calculator with a hardened exterior" and "a fierce pride that did not easily forget its wounding."[^45] He ousted his partner Stanford from the Southern Pacific presidency and showed little mercy to competitors or those who opposed his interests.

## Personal Life

Collis Huntington's personal life was marked by both stability and controversy. His first marriage to Elizabeth Stoddard lasted from 1844 until her death from cancer in 1883. The couple had no biological children but adopted Elizabeth's niece, Clara Prentice, who later became Princess Clara von Hatzveldt.[^46]

Within months of Elizabeth's death, on July 12, 1884, Huntington married Arabella Duval Yarrington Worsham in a ceremony performed by the famous preacher Reverend Henry Ward Beecher.[^47] Arabella brought to the marriage her son Archer Milton Worsham, born March 10, 1870, whose paternity was subject to rumors—some suggested Collis might have been Archer's biological father, implying a relationship with Arabella before his first wife's death.[^48] Huntington formally adopted Archer after the marriage.

Arabella was sophisticated, cultured, and passionate about art collecting. She became one of America's foremost art collectors, and her acquisitions later formed part of the foundation of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery in California after she married Huntington's nephew, Henry E. Huntington, following Collis's death.[^49]

Despite his wealth, Huntington maintained a focus on business rather than socializing. He once said, "I have always looked after the little things of my business; weightier matters will take care of themselves."[^50] This attention to detail characterized his management style. Regarding Mark Hopkins, he stated: "Mark Hopkins was one of the truest and best men that ever lived. He had a keen analytical mind; was thoroughly accurate, and took general supervision of the books, contracts, etc."[^51]

Huntington attributed some of his railroad-building success to his early experiences: "I once drove a pair of horses from New York to Vicksburg, and to this day I can almost map out that country as I saw it then, with its hills and valleys, villages and rivers. Yes, I naturally attribute something of my success in railroad building to the interest I take in such things."[^52]

Collis P. Huntington died suddenly on August 13, 1900, at his Great Camp at Raquette Lake in the Adirondacks, New York, at age 78.[^53] At the time of his death, he was one of the wealthiest men in America, with estimates of his fortune ranging from $50 million to $70 million (equivalent to approximately $1.5 to $2.1 billion in 2025 dollars).[^54]

## Legacy

### Economic and Infrastructure Impact

Huntington's railroad empire fundamentally transformed the American West and the nation's economy. The transcontinental railroad reduced cross-country travel from months to days, facilitated western settlement, enabled the movement of goods and resources, and helped unite the nation economically following the Civil War.[^55] The Southern Pacific's 9,600-mile network connected California to the rest of the nation and spurred development throughout the Southwest.[^56]

His development of Newport News created a major port and industrial center that remains economically significant today. Newport News Shipbuilding continues as one of America's premier shipyards, building aircraft carriers and submarines for the U.S. Navy.[^57] The city of Huntington, West Virginia, named in his honor, became an important railroad and commercial center.

### Philanthropic Contributions

While less known than his business activities, Huntington engaged in several philanthropic endeavors, particularly supporting African American education—a somewhat progressive stance for his era, though historians debate his motivations.[^58]

He made specific bequests totaling $125,000 to Hampton Institute (now Hampton University), built a sawmill for the institution, and annually donated scholarships.[^59] After his death, Arabella funded a library building at Hampton Institute in his memory; the 1903 library building still stands today. Huntington also supported Booker T. Washington's efforts at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, where a building was named in his honor—the Collis P. Huntington Memorial Building.[^60]

Huntington willed one of his homes to Yale University, made gifts to New York's Natural History Museum, and established the Huntington Free Library in Westchester, New York, "open to all races and creeds, to share and share alike."[^61] He financially supported the Metropolitan Museum of Art and bequeathed his art collection, valued at $3 million, to the museum (with the collection to pass to the museum after the death of his stepson Archer).[^62]

### The Huntington Library

Though Collis himself did not create it, his fortune contributed to one of America's great cultural institutions. His nephew Henry E. Huntington, who assumed leadership of many industrial endeavors after Collis's death, founded the Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California.[^63] Arabella's art purchases and the family wealth became foundational to this institution, which houses rare books, manuscripts, and art collections valued by scholars worldwide.

### Cities and Institutions Named for Huntington

Beyond Huntington, West Virginia, numerous places, buildings, and institutions bear his name, including Huntington Park in California, the Huntington Hotel in San Francisco, and various schools and landmarks throughout the West—testament to his widespread economic impact, if not always his methods.[^64]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historian Richard White argues that transcontinental railroad builders attracted contradictory interpretations—initially depicted as "Robber Barons, standing for a Gilded Age of corruption, monopoly, and rampant individualism," but in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries viewed as "entrepreneurs, necessary business revolutionaries."[^65]

Some historians emphasize Huntington's genuine achievements: he helped build critical infrastructure that connected the nation, created thousands of jobs, spurred western development, and demonstrated remarkable business acumen. From poverty in rural Connecticut, he built one of America's great fortunes through vision, determination, and skill.[^66]

Proponents note that the transcontinental railroad would not have been built when it was without government incentives, and that Huntington's aggressive lobbying, while corrupt by modern standards, operated within the norms of Gilded Age business practices. They argue he delivered results—the railroad was completed—and that his economic contributions outweigh his ethical failings.[^67]

Recent scholarship also acknowledges his support for African American education as noteworthy, even if motivated partly by paternalism or labor control considerations.[^68]

### Negative Views

Most historians emphasize Huntington's role in establishing patterns of corporate corruption that plagued American politics for generations. The Colton letters provided documentary evidence of systematic bribery, and Huntington's own words condemned him.[^69]

Critics note that the Big Four received enormous government subsidies—bonds and land grants worth hundreds of millions of dollars—yet treated the railroads as private property, manipulating rates, exploiting farmers and merchants, and extracting maximum profit while minimizing service.[^70] The "Octopus," as Frank Norris famously characterized the Southern Pacific in his 1901 novel, strangled California's economy and politics for decades.

Huntington's treatment of Chinese workers, while pragmatic, reflected racist exploitation—paying them less than white workers and subjecting them to dangerous conditions. Thousands died in railroad construction, particularly in the Sierra Nevada.[^71]

Historian after historian has concluded that Huntington "came to symbolize the greed and corruption of late-nineteenth-century business" and served as "a prime practitioner" of "some of the greatest ravaging of the public purse and systematic political corruption on record."[^72]

Perhaps most damning, Huntington showed no remorse. When questioned about his methods, he demonstrated only cynicism about the political process and pride in his manipulation of it. His legacy is inseparable from the corruption he embodied and normalized.[^73]
