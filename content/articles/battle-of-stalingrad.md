## Overview

The Battle of Stalingrad (August 23, 1942 – February 2, 1943) was the bloodiest battle in the history of warfare. Fought between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union for control of the industrial city of Stalingrad on the Volga River, it marked the psychological and strategic turning point of World War II. What began as a German offensive to cut Soviet oil supplies turned into a meat-grinder of close-quarters urban combat ("Rattenkrieg"). The Soviet counter-offensive, Operation Uranus, encircled the entire German 6th Army. Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus eventually surrendered, marking the first time a German Field Marshal had ever been captured.

## Preliminaries

### Operation Blue (Fall Blau)
Hitler's 1942 summer offensive aimed to capture the oil fields of the Caucasus (Baku).
Stalingrad was initially a secondary target to protect the flank. However, the city bore Stalin's name, making it a symbolic prize for Hitler and a "must-hold" for Stalin.

### The City
Stalingrad stretched 30 miles along the western bank of the Volga. It was a major industrial hub (tractor/tank factories).

---

## Order of Battle

### Axis Powers (Germany, Romania, Italy, Hungary)
**Army Group B (General Maximilian von Weichs)**
- **6th Army (Friedrich Paulus):** The elite striking arm of the Wehrmacht.
- **4th Panzer Army (Hermann Hoth)**
- **3rd & 4th Romanian Armies:** Protecting the vulnerable flanks.
- **Total:** ~1,000,000 men, 500 tanks, 700 aircraft.

### Soviet Union (Red Army)
**Stalingrad Front (Andrey Yeryomenko / Nikita Khrushchev)**
**62nd Army (Vasily Chuikov):** The legendary defenders of the city.
- **Total:** Initially outnumbered, but reserves poured in. Final strength ~1,100,000 men.

## The Battle: Phase 1 (The Assault)

### August 23: The Bombing
Luftwaffe General Wolfram von Richthofen launched a massive terror bombing raid.
- 40,000 civilians killed in first week.
- City turned to rubble (ironically creating perfect defensive cover).

### Sept–Nov: Rattenkrieg (Rat War)
General Chuikov's tactic: **"Hug the Enemy."**
Keep Soviet lines so close to Germans (sometimes hearing them breathe through walls) that Luftwaffe couldn't bomb without hitting their own troops.
**Key Battlegrounds:**
- **Mamayev Kurgan:** A hill overlooking the city. Changed hands 8 times.
- **Grain Elevator:** 40 Soviet soldiers held off tanks for days.
- **Pavlov's House:** Sgt. Yakov Pavlov fortified an apartment building. Held it for 60 days (longer than France held out). German maps marked it as a fortress.

**Attrition:**
Life expectancy of a new Soviet soldier: **24 hours**.
Germans captured 90% of the city but could not push the Soviets into the Volga. The river froze, allowing Soviets to resupply over ice.

## The Battle: Phase 2 (The Trap)

### Operation Uranus (November 19, 1942)
General Georgy Zhukov noticed the German flanks were held by weaker Romanian/Italian/Hungarian troops lacking anti-tank weapons.
**The Pincer:**
Soviets launched massive armored attacks north and south of the city, smashing through Romanian lines.
**The Encirclement:**
November 23: The two Soviet pincers met at Kalach.
**The Pocket (The Kessel):**
250,000 Axis soldiers (the 6th Army) were trapped inside Stalingrad.

### The Starvation
Hitler forbade a breakout ("Stand and Fight!").
Goering promised the Luftwaffe could resupply the army by air (needs: 700 tons/day. reality: 90 tons/day).
Soldiers ate horses, then rats. Typhus spread. Temperatures hit -30°C.

---

## The End

### Operation Ring (January 1943)
Soviets squeezed the pocket.
**Paulus's Promotion:**
Jan 30: Hitler promoted Paulus to Field Marshal. (Implication: No German Field Marshal has ever surrendered. You should commit suicide).
**Surrender:**
Jan 31/Feb 2: Paulus surrendered.

## Weapons & Tactics

**German:**
- **MP-40:** Submachine gun (excellent for urban).
- **Stuka (Ju 87):** Terror sirens (psychological).
- **Sniper:** Major Konig (legend, possibly myth).

**Soviet:**
- **PPSh-41:** Drum-fed SMG (71 rounds). The king of street fighting.
- **T-34 Tank:** Robust, wide tracks for snow.
- **Sniper:** Vasily Zaytsev (225 confirmed kills). Propaganda hero.

## Historical Assessment

**Why Germany lost:**
1.  **Hubris:** Hitler split his forces (Stalingrad vs Caucasus).
2.  **Flanks:** Relying on ill-equipped allies (Romania/Italy) to guard the rear.
3.  **Winter:** Lack of prep.
4.  **Urban Combat:** German blitzkrieg doctrine (speed/maneuver) failed in rubble.

**Legacy:**
- Shattered the myth of Wehrmacht invincibility.
- After Stalingrad, Germany was always retreating.
- Massive psychological boost for Allied morale.
