## Summary

François Englert, together with Robert Brout, independently proposed the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism in 1964, simultaneously with Peter Higgs. Their theory explained how elementary particles acquire mass through interaction with a scalar field. He shared the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics with Peter Higgs after the discovery of the Higgs boson at CERN.
