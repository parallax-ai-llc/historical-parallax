## Summary

Faxian was a Chinese Buddhist monk and explorer who made a 15-year pilgrimage from China to India and back (399-414 AD), one of the earliest recorded long-distance journeys. His detailed travel account Foguoji documented geography, natural history, and cultures across Central and South Asia. He traveled overland via the Silk Road and returned by sea.
