## Summary

Moses (מֹשֶׁה, Moshe) is the central prophet of Judaism and a major figure in Christianity and Islam, traditionally regarded as the author of the Torah (first five books of the Bible) and leader of the Israelites' Exodus from Egyptian slavery. According to biblical narrative, Moses was born to Hebrew slaves during Egyptian persecution, hidden in a basket and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter. After killing an Egyptian overseer, he fled to Midian where God appeared in a burning bush, commanding him to free the Israelites. Moses confronted Pharaoh, unleashed ten plagues, led the Exodus through the parted Red Sea, received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, and guided the Israelites for 40 years in the wilderness. Though historical evidence is limited, Moses' religious and cultural legacy is immense: he established monotheistic law, defined Jewish identity, and profoundly influenced Western ethics, law, and civilization.
