## Overview

The Battle of Myeongnyang (명량대첩, 鳴梁大捷) occurred on October 26, 1597, during the second Japanese invasion of Korea (Jeongyu War). Admiral Yi Sun-sin, with only 13 ships remaining after a disastrous period of his absence, faced a Japanese fleet of 133 warships. In one of history's greatest naval victories, Yi's forces destroyed 31 Japanese ships without losing a single vessel. This miraculous victory prevented Japan from dominating the Yellow Sea and saved the Joseon Dynasty.

## Background

### Imjin War (1592-1598)

**First Invasion (1592):**
Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea with 150,000 troops. Land forces swept through peninsula, but Admiral Yi Sun-sin's naval victories (Okpo, Hansan Island) cut Japanese supply lines and prevented conquest.

**Truce Period (1593-1597):**
Negotiations failed. Japan prepared second invasion.

### Yi Sun-sin's Downfall and Return

**Political Intrigue:**
Japanese double agent convinced Korean court that Yi was insubordinate. Yi was arrested, stripped of rank, tortured, and demoted to common soldier.

**Won Gyun's Disaster:**
Admiral Won Gyun replaced Yi. At Battle of Chilchonryang (July 1597), Won led fleet into Japanese trap. Korean navy virtually destroyed—157 ships lost, Won killed.

**Yi Restored:**
Only 13 ships remained. Yi was hastily reinstated as commander.

## The Strategic Situation

### Korea's Desperate Position

**Fleet Destroyed:**
From 100+ turtle ships and panokseon, only 13 vessels survived.

**Japan's Advance:**
Japanese planned to sail north through Yellow Sea, land troops, encircle peninsula.

**Yi's Challenge:**
Stop 133 Japanese ships with 13. Conventional wisdom: impossible.

### Myeongnyang Strait (Uldolmok)

**Geography:**
Narrow strait between Jindo Island and mainland. Only ~300 meters wide at narrowest.

**Tidal Currents:**
Extremely strong currents (up to 11.5 knots), reversing every six hours. One of strongest tidal races in world.

**Yi's Calculation:**
Current could be weapon. Japanese numbers useless in narrow strait.

## The Battle

### October 26, 1597

**Morning:**
Japanese fleet of 133 warships (some sources: 330) approached Myeongnyang Strait.

**Yi's Position:**
Positioned 13 ships at narrowest point, chained together. Wait for favorable tide.

**Yi's Speech:**
> "Those who seek death shall live; those who seek life shall die."
> (必死則生 必生則死)

### Phase 1: Yi Alone

**Yi's Flagship Advances:**
Other captains hesitated. Yi's flagship alone engaged lead Japanese ships.

**For Two Hours:**
Yi Sun-sin fought alone or nearly alone, his flagship surrounded.

**Turning Point:**
Seeing their admiral fighting alone, other Korean ships joined the battle.

### Phase 2: The Whirlpool

**Tide Changes:**
Powerful current reversed, flowing against Japanese.

**Japanese Chaos:**
Crowded in narrow strait, Japanese ships collided. Strong current made maneuvering impossible.

**Korean Attack:**
Yi's ships, having positioned with current, attacked disoriented Japanese.

### Results

**Japanese Losses:**
- 31 warships destroyed
- Approximately 8,000 Japanese killed
- Commander Kurushima Michifusa killed (highest-ranking Japanese killed in naval battle)

**Korean Losses:**
- Zero ships lost
- Minimal casualties
- Yi Sun-sin lightly wounded

## Aftermath

### Strategic Impact

**Japanese Advance Halted:**
Japan abandoned plan to control Yellow Sea. Supply lines to western Korea cut.

**War Stalemate:**
Combined with Chinese intervention, Japan couldn't achieve objectives.

**Hideyoshi's Death (1598):**
Japanese forces withdrew after Hideyoshi died.

### Yi's Return to Glory

Victory restored Yi's reputation. Continued commanding until death at Battle of Noryang (1598).

## Battle Tactics

### Yi's Genius

**Terrain Selection:**
Chose battle site that negated enemy numbers.

**Tidal Timing:**
Engaged when current favored his forces.

**Crane Wing Formation:**
Possibly used formation focusing fire on lead ships.

**Personal Leadership:**
Fighting at front inspired hesitant captains.

**Psychological Warfare:**
Chained ships showed no retreat possible.
