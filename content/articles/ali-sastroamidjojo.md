## Summary

Ali Sastroamidjojo (21 May 1903 – 13 March 1975) was a prominent Indonesian statesman, diplomat, and nationalist leader who served twice as Prime Minister of Indonesia during the parliamentary democracy period. A lawyer by training with a doctorate from Leiden University, he played a pivotal role in Indonesia's independence movement and became best known internationally for organizing and chairing the historic 1955 Asian-African Conference in Bandung, which laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement. Throughout his career, he held key positions including Indonesia's first ambassador to the United States, UN Permanent Representative, and chairman of the Indonesian National Party (PNI), earning recognition as one of Indonesia's greatest statesmen despite facing criticism for political pragmatism and his party's internal struggles.

## Early Life and Background

Ali Sastroamidjojo was born on 21 May 1903 in Grabag, Central Java, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), into an aristocratic Javanese family belonging to the elite priyayi class of the Magelang Regency.[^1][^2] He was the 11th child among 12 siblings in a family deeply rooted in traditional Javanese culture and colonial administration. His father, R. Ng. Sastroamidjojo, served as a Wedana (district chief) in Jetis, Temanggung, while his mother, Kustiah, was a relative of the Regent of Magelang.[^3] Both parents were staunch defenders of Javanese customs and traditions, instilling in young Ali a deep appreciation for his cultural heritage.

Ali spent his early childhood in the local town, playing with children from peasant families, which gave him exposure to the lives of ordinary Indonesians beyond his privileged background.[^4] Recognizing the importance of education for their children's future, the Sastroamidjojo family relocated to the city, where Ali was sent to receive a European-style education at the Queen Wilhelmina School, a Dutch school that provided him with fluency in the Dutch language alongside his studies in Javanese.[^5] This bilingual and bicultural upbringing would prove invaluable in his later diplomatic and political career, allowing him to navigate both Indonesian and Western contexts with sophistication.

After completing his secondary education at the Hogere Burgerschool (HBS), Ali obtained a scholarship to study in the Netherlands in the early 1920s.[^6] He initially attempted to enter the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy at Leiden University but was rejected because his HBS diploma did not meet the specific requirements.[^7] Undeterred, he studied Latin and Greek literature before ultimately switching to law, a field that would provide the foundation for his future political career. During his years in Leiden, Ali became deeply involved in the Indonesian nationalist movement, joining youth organizations such as Jong Java and the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (Indonesian Association), which brought together Indonesian students studying abroad who were committed to their homeland's independence.[^8]

In 1927, Ali defended his law thesis to earn his Meester in de Rechten (Bachelor of Law) degree, though under extraordinary circumstances—he had to complete his defense under police guard after being briefly arrested along with fellow nationalist Mohammad Hatta for revolutionary activities against Dutch colonial rule.[^9] This early brush with colonial authorities marked the beginning of Ali's lifelong commitment to Indonesian independence. In 1922, after graduating from HBS, Ali had met Titi Roelia, who would later become his wife, establishing the personal foundation that would support him throughout his tumultuous political career.[^10]

## Rise to Power

Upon returning to the Dutch East Indies in 1928, Ali Sastroamidjojo established himself as a practicing lawyer, opening his own law office and beginning to build his reputation both professionally and politically.[^11] He immediately threw himself into nationalist activities, co-publishing the magazine Djanget in Surakarta together with Soekiman Wirjosandjojo, who would also later become an Indonesian prime minister.[^12] This publication served as a vehicle for nationalist ideas and helped build networks among Indonesian intellectuals and activists who were increasingly vocal in their opposition to Dutch colonial rule.

Ali's political activism intensified when he joined Sukarno's Indonesian National Party (PNI), which had been founded in 1927 as a revolutionary organization dedicated to achieving Indonesian independence through non-cooperation with the Dutch colonial authorities.[^13] The PNI would eventually evolve into one of Indonesia's most important political parties, and Ali became an active member of the Yogyakarta Branch, working alongside other nationalist leaders to build a mass movement. He was also involved with Partindo, another nationalist organization that emerged from splits within the independence movement.

Following the proclamation of Indonesian Independence on 17 August 1945 by Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, Ali Sastroamidjojo's political career entered a new phase.[^14] He was appointed deputy minister of education in Indonesia's very first cabinet, serving from September to November 1945, a position that demonstrated his status as a trusted member of the nationalist leadership. He subsequently served as Minister of Education in the Amir Syarifuddin Cabinet and the Hatta Cabinet between July 1947 and August 1949, playing a crucial role in developing Indonesia's educational infrastructure during the tumultuous years of the Indonesian National Revolution.[^15]

Ali's diplomatic skills came to the fore during the negotiations with the Netherlands that would determine the terms of Indonesian independence. He served as deputy chairman of the delegation of the Republic of Indonesia in negotiations with the Netherlands and became a member of the delegation at the crucial Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference held in The Hague from 23 August to 2 November 1949.[^16] This conference resulted in the formal transfer of sovereignty from the Netherlands to the United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949, marking the international recognition of Indonesian independence.[^17]

After the recognition of Indonesian sovereignty, Ali Sastroamidjojo was appointed as Indonesia's first Ambassador to the United States, serving simultaneously as Ambassador to Canada and Mexico from 1950 to 1955.[^18] This prestigious posting reflected his diplomatic abilities and his facility with Western political culture. During this period, he achieved a significant milestone by purchasing the Walsh-McLean House at 2020 Massachusetts Avenue in Washington, D.C., on 19 December 1951 for $335,000 on behalf of the Government of Indonesia—less than half its original 1903 construction price—to serve as the Indonesian embassy.[^19] The government spent an additional $75,000 to restore the massive 50-room mansion, establishing an impressive diplomatic presence for the young nation in the American capital.

## Major Achievements

Ali Sastroamidjojo's ascension to the position of Prime Minister came on 1 August 1953, when he was chosen to lead a new cabinet following the fall of the Wilopo Cabinet.[^20] The Wilopo Cabinet had collapsed after the Tanjung Morawa affair, in which five peasants were killed by police on 16 March 1953 during a land dispute with foreign plantation owners in North Sumatra, triggering political turmoil.[^21] Ali was selected after over six weeks of bargaining and five different attempts at various party combinations, eventually forming a coalition cabinet dominated by the PNI in alliance with minor nationalist, conservative Muslim, and leftist parties.[^22]

The First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, which served from 30 July 1953 until 12 August 1955, was notably different from its predecessors in composition—only four of its twenty members had participated in any of the preceding four cabinets, representing a significant generational shift in Indonesian politics.[^23] On 25 August 1953, Prime Minister Ali announced an ambitious 16-month schedule for Indonesia's first democratic elections, starting from January 1954, and on 4 November 1953, he announced the creation of the new Central Electoral Committee to oversee this historic democratic exercise.[^24]

The cabinet's economic policy focused on "Indonesianization," expanding the bureaucracy with more PNI officials and encouraging indigenous businessmen to open new firms to reduce foreign economic dominance.[^25] However, the cabinet's most enduring achievement was undoubtedly in foreign policy: the organization and implementation of the Asian-African Conference, which took place in Bandung in April 1955.[^26]

The Asian-African Conference, commonly known as the Bandung Conference, represented Ali Sastroamidjojo's greatest contribution to international diplomacy and his most lasting legacy. The idea emerged from an informal meeting in Bogor, spearheaded by Ali in collaboration with the prime ministers of Burma, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), India, and Pakistan.[^27] What began as exploratory discussions quickly evolved into a formal gathering of 29 Asian and African nations, most of which were newly independent from colonial rule, representing a total population of 1.5 billion people—54% of the world's population at the time.[^28]

Ali Sastroamidjojo was appointed chairman of the Asian-African Conference, which was held from 18 to 24 April 1955 in Bandung, West Java.[^29] Between 1953 and 1955, he delivered eleven recorded speeches explaining his vision for the conference, including three speeches in India in September 1954 that helped secure support and resulted in the Ali-Nehru Joint Statement, and speeches in Burma that secured the Ali-U Nu Joint Statement.[^30] At the Bogor Conference in late December 1954, Ali urged agreement on implementing the conference, and he delivered both the opening speech on 18 April 1955 and the closing speech on 24 April 1955 at the Bandung Conference itself.[^31]

In his closing address, Ali Sastroamidjojo proclaimed that the Bandung Conference had been a success and expressed hope that it would "remain a beacon of progress for Asian and African nations in the future."[^32] While the Asian-African Conference is sometimes misrepresented as the beginning of the Non-Aligned Movement itself, more accurately, the 1955 Bandung Conference and its final communiqué laid the crucial foundation for the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961.[^33] The conference promoted cooperation among Asian and African nations, opposed colonialism, and established principles of peaceful coexistence that would influence international relations for decades.

After his first cabinet fell in July 1955, Ali Sastroamidjojo returned as Prime Minister for a second time on 24 March 1956, leading the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet until 9 April 1957.[^34] This coalition government was formed after Indonesia's historic 1955 elections and focused on ambitious policies including a Five-Year Plan that addressed the return of West Irian (Western New Guinea), regional autonomy, improving workers' conditions, and economic development, alongside continued Indonesianization of the economy.[^35]

Following the collapse of his second cabinet, Ali served as Indonesia's Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1957 to 1960, continuing his distinguished diplomatic career on the global stage.[^36] In July 1960, at the ninth annual congress of the Indonesian National Party held in Surakarta, Central Java, Ali was elected party chairman, replacing Suwiryo.[^37] Under his leadership, the party underwent organizational reforms to restore central authority, resulting in party membership increasing dramatically from 198,554 members in April 1961 to 1,858,119 members by the time of the 10th Party Congress.[^38] He was re-elected as general chairman at the 10th PNI Congress in Purwokerto, serving in this position from 1960 until 1966.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Ali Sastroamidjojo's political career was marked by significant controversies and criticisms, particularly regarding his leadership style and his party's inability to address Indonesia's mounting political and economic problems. The Indonesian National Party under his leadership faced accusations of failing to confront Indonesia's political challenges coherently.[^40] During the years preceding Ali's chairmanship, chaos had pervaded the party's provincial organization, resulting in growing challenges from the young and left-wing camp, which eventually formed Partindo, a new left-wing party that reflected widespread criticism of the PNI's direction.[^41]

When Ali took over as PNI chairman in 1960, he was described as "a consummate politician imbued with a healthy sense of self-preservation," but he frequently disappointed his supporters from the young and left-wing camp by positioning himself in the political center rather than embracing more progressive stances.[^42] This pragmatic approach to politics, while perhaps necessary for survival in Indonesia's volatile political environment, led to accusations that he lacked ideological commitment and was more interested in maintaining power than implementing transformative change.

The First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet faced numerous security challenges, including Darul Islam separatist movements and rebellions in most areas of Aceh, which the government struggled to contain.[^43] The cabinet's welfare improvement efforts faced severe problems of high inflation and widespread corruption, undermining public confidence in the government's ability to manage the economy effectively. The biggest problem that ultimately led to the cabinet's dissolution involved Defense Minister Iwa Koesoemasoemantri from the 'progressive faction' (affiliated with the Communist Party of Indonesia), whose controversial actions created insurmountable political difficulties.[^44]

The Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet faced even more severe challenges. Regional rebellions emerged with the formation of various military councils including Dewan Banteng in Sumatra, Dewan Gajah in North Sumatra, Dewan Garuda in South Sumatra, Dewan Lambung Mangkurat in South Kalimantan, and Dewan Manguni in North Sulawesi, threatening national unity.[^45] Political discord intensified between the Masyumi and PNI parties, with Masyumi demanding that Ali return his mandate in response to regional demands, while PNI argued that doing so would mean abandoning democratic and parliamentary principles.[^46] Anti-Chinese sentiment also intensified among the public during this period, adding to the cabinet's challenges.[^47]

The Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet collapsed on 14 March 1957 as a result of pressure from regional rebellions, splits between the coalition parties, and attacks on the political system itself.[^48] On 9 January 1957, five ministers—Mohammed Roem, Jusuf Wibisono, Muljatno, Suchjar Tedjasukmana, and Pangeran Mohammad Noor—resigned from the cabinet, ultimately bringing down the coalition government.[^49] Prime Minister Ali resigned on 14 March in Sukarno's presence, and his cabinet was replaced by an extra-parliamentary cabinet of experts handpicked by President Sukarno, marking a crucial turning point toward the end of liberal democracy in Indonesia.[^50]

Ali's resignation effectively paved the way for President Sukarno to implement his vision of "Guided Democracy," ending the parliamentary system that had seen frequent cabinet changes since independence. In a speech commemorating the 36th PNI Anniversary on 7 July 1963, Ali demonstrated a shift toward more leftist positions, stating that "The doctrine (Marhaenism) and the program of struggle based on scientific socialism are further based on Marxist socialism," reflecting his attempt to align the party with the prevailing political winds under Sukarno's increasingly authoritarian rule.[^51]

Ali's chairmanship of the PNI ended at an extraordinary congress in Bandung from 21 to 27 April 1966, when the left-wing Ali and Surachman camp was overthrown by the conservative faction in the aftermath of the failed 1965 coup attempt and the subsequent political upheaval that brought General Suharto to power.[^52] Osa Maliki was elected as the new chairman, marking the end of Ali's formal leadership role in the party he had served for decades.

## Personal Life

Ali Sastroamidjojo's personal life remained relatively private throughout his public career, with limited information available about his family relationships and personal interests. In 1922, after graduating from HBS, Ali met Titi Roelia, who would become his wife, establishing a partnership that would endure throughout his decades of political activism and government service.[^53] The details of their marriage, including whether they had children and how Titi Roelia supported Ali's demanding career, remain largely undocumented in available historical sources.

Ali came from a prominent family that produced other notable figures in Indonesian public life. He was the uncle of Ali Wardhana, who would later serve as Indonesia's Finance Minister and become one of the country's most respected economic technocrats.[^54] This family connection to another influential Indonesian leader suggests that the Sastroamidjojo family maintained its position of influence across multiple generations.

Despite his aristocratic background and elite education, Ali maintained a connection to ordinary Indonesians that dated back to his childhood experiences playing with children from peasant families in his hometown.[^55] This early exposure to different social classes may have contributed to his political ideology and his commitment to nationalist principles that emphasized Indonesian unity across class lines.

Ali's intellectual interests extended beyond politics and diplomacy. He was a noted author who published several books and publications in the field of international relations and foreign policy, demonstrating his commitment to scholarly analysis alongside practical political engagement.[^56] His most significant literary work was his autobiography, "Milestones on My Journey: The Memoirs of Ali Sastroamidjojo, Indonesian Patriot and Political Leader," which he was writing when he died in 1975.[^57] Edited by C.L.M. Penders and published posthumously by the University of Queensland Press in 1979, the 405-page memoir explored not only his personal life's journey but also Indonesia's political evolution from the nationalist movement in the 1920s until the early 1960s.[^58]

What distinguished Ali's memoirs was his remarkable honesty and integrity in revealing his life experiences, including the difficulties and failures he faced. According to reviewers, "there is not the slightest attempt to cover his weaknesses or to build his self-image," a refreshing candor unusual among political memoirs.[^59] Ali paid particular attention to foreign policy issues throughout the book, even when discussing his terms as prime minister, with special emphasis on organizing cooperation between the non-aligned nations of Asia and Africa—the achievement he clearly considered his most important contribution.[^60]

## Legacy

Ali Sastroamidjojo died in Jakarta on 13 March 1975 at the age of 71, bringing to an end a political career that had spanned nearly five decades from the colonial era through independence and into the authoritarian New Order period under President Suharto.[^61] His body was interred at the Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery, officially known as the National Main Heroes' Cemetery in Kalibata, South Jakarta—a military cemetery where more than 7,000 military casualties and veterans from the Indonesian War of Independence are buried.[^62] This burial site, reserved for those who made significant contributions to the nation, was a fitting resting place for a man who had dedicated his life to Indonesian independence and sovereignty.

Ali Sastroamidjojo has been called "the greatest statesman" of Indonesia, a testament to his enduring reputation despite the political controversies and cabinet failures that marked his time as prime minister.[^63] This recognition reflects the fact that his contributions to Indonesian nationalism, diplomacy, and international standing transcended the domestic political struggles that characterized the tumultuous parliamentary democracy period. His legacy rests primarily on three pillars: his role in the independence movement and negotiations, his service as Indonesia's first ambassador to major Western nations, and most importantly, his organization of the Bandung Conference.

The Asian-African Conference of 1955 remains Ali's most significant and lasting contribution to world history. As the conference's principal organizer and chairman, he brought together leaders representing more than half of humanity to discuss cooperation, oppose colonialism, and establish principles of peaceful coexistence that would influence international relations for decades.[^64] The conference produced the "Ten Principles of Bandung," which later influenced the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961 and provided a framework for newly independent nations to assert their sovereignty and resist Cold War pressures to align with either the United States or the Soviet Union.[^65]

Ali's diplomatic vision emphasized South-South cooperation and solidarity among formerly colonized peoples, an approach that helped establish Indonesia as a leader among developing nations and gave small and medium-sized countries a platform to assert their interests on the world stage. The Bandung Conference demonstrated that newly independent nations could organize major international events and articulate alternative visions for world order, challenging the bipolar Cold War framework that dominated international politics in the 1950s.

Beyond the Bandung Conference, Ali's tenure as Indonesia's first ambassador to the United States established the foundation for bilateral relations between the two nations during a critical period. His purchase of the Walsh-McLean House as the Indonesian embassy in Washington created a prestigious physical presence for Indonesian diplomacy that continues to serve the nation today.[^66] His service at the United Nations from 1957 to 1960 as Indonesia's Permanent Representative further enhanced the country's diplomatic standing during the crucial early years of the organization's expansion to include newly independent nations.

Within Indonesia, Ali's legacy is more complex and contested. While respected for his diplomatic achievements and his role in the independence movement, his two terms as prime minister during the liberal democracy period are remembered as times of political instability, regional rebellions, and economic challenges. The failure of parliamentary democracy in Indonesia—symbolized by the frequent cabinet changes and Ali's own resignation in 1957—paved the way for Sukarno's Guided Democracy and ultimately for decades of authoritarian rule. Whether Ali and his contemporaries could have done more to make parliamentary democracy work remains a subject of historical debate.

Ali's chairmanship of the Indonesian National Party from 1960 to 1966 coincided with some of the most turbulent years in Indonesian history, including the confrontation with Malaysia, increasing communist influence, hyperinflation, and ultimately the failed 1965 coup attempt and its bloody aftermath. His removal from party leadership in 1966 reflected the broader political transformation as the military under General Suharto consolidated power and marginalized the civilian politicians who had dominated the independence generation.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters of Ali Sastroamidjojo emphasize his crucial contributions to Indonesian independence, diplomacy, and international standing during formative years for the young nation. Historians of the Bandung Conference consistently highlight Ali's organizational genius and diplomatic skill in bringing together 29 Asian and African nations for what became one of the most significant international gatherings of the 20th century.[^67] His ability to navigate between different factions—securing support from India's Jawaharlal Nehru, Burma's U Nu, and other leaders with varying perspectives on non-alignment and international relations—demonstrated sophisticated diplomatic capabilities.[^68]

Ali's role in the Round Table Conference negotiations that secured Indonesian sovereignty is recognized as an important contribution to the independence struggle, even if overshadowed by more prominent figures like Sukarno and Hatta.[^69] His service in multiple cabinets as Minister of Education during the National Revolution showed his commitment to building Indonesia's educational infrastructure even amid the chaos of warfare with Dutch forces attempting to reimpose colonial control.

Supporters praise Ali's honesty and integrity, as evidenced by his candid memoirs that acknowledged his failures and weaknesses rather than engaging in self-aggrandizement.[^70] This intellectual honesty is seen as reflecting a commitment to truth that was rare among political leaders. His scholarly contributions through books and publications on international relations and foreign policy demonstrated that he was not merely a politician but also a thoughtful analyst of global affairs.[^71]

Ali's background as a lawyer trained at Leiden University and his bicultural facility with both Javanese traditions and Western political culture made him uniquely qualified to represent Indonesia on the world stage during a period when the country was establishing its international identity. His aristocratic background and education did not prevent him from committing to nationalist principles and working for independence, showing that dedication to anti-colonialism transcended class interests.

The dramatic increase in PNI membership during Ali's chairmanship—from fewer than 200,000 to over 1.8 million members—is cited as evidence of his organizational abilities and his appeal to Indonesian voters who saw him as a genuine nationalist leader.[^72] His re-election as party chairman at the 10th PNI Congress demonstrated continued confidence in his leadership among party members.

### Negative Views

Critics of Ali Sastroamidjojo point to his political pragmatism and centrism as evidence of a lack of ideological conviction and principled leadership. His tendency to disappoint progressive supporters by positioning himself in the middle rather than taking bold stances is seen as reflecting opportunism rather than statesmanship.[^73] This criticism suggests that Ali was more interested in maintaining his position and navigating factional politics than in implementing transformative change or taking risks for his principles.

The failures of both Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinets are cited as evidence of his limitations as a domestic political leader. The First Cabinet's inability to address security challenges including Darul Islam rebellions in Aceh, combined with high inflation and widespread corruption, demonstrated weak governance.[^74] The Second Cabinet's collapse amid regional rebellions and the formation of multiple military councils challenging central authority showed that Ali could not maintain national unity or manage the centrifugal forces threatening to tear Indonesia apart.[^75]

Critics argue that Ali's resignation in March 1957 effectively enabled Sukarno's transition to Guided Democracy and the end of Indonesia's experiment with parliamentary government.[^76] While the structural problems facing Indonesian democracy were larger than any single leader could address, Ali's failure to find a way forward contributed to the abandonment of democratic institutions. Some historians suggest that the parliamentary democracy period leaders, including Ali, bear responsibility for not building stronger democratic foundations that could have withstood the pressures of regionalism, military involvement in politics, and ideological polarization.

Ali's shift toward more leftist rhetoric in the 1960s, including his 1963 statement embracing Marxist socialism as the foundation for the PNI's program, is seen by some critics as cynical adaptation to Sukarno's increasingly radical political orientation rather than genuine ideological conviction.[^77] This interpretation portrays Ali as willing to compromise his principles to maintain relevance in a political environment increasingly dominated by Sukarno's personality and the growing influence of the Communist Party of Indonesia.

The Indonesian National Party's documented failure to confront Indonesia's political problems coherently, with chaos pervading provincial organization during the 1950s, reflects poorly on Ali's leadership both as a cabinet minister and later as party chairman.[^78] Critics suggest that the PNI under various leaders including Ali became more focused on patronage, bureaucratic expansion, and factional competition than on developing effective policies to address Indonesia's development challenges.

Ali's ultimate removal from PNI leadership in April 1966 by the conservative faction represented a repudiation of his leadership during the turbulent Guided Democracy period.[^79] While this occurred amid the broader political upheaval following the 1965 coup attempt, it nonetheless demonstrated that even within his own party, Ali's leadership had become controversial and divisive. Some critics view his entire post-1957 political career as a gradual decline in influence and effectiveness as he struggled to remain relevant in an increasingly authoritarian system that marginalized the very parliamentary politicians and institutions he had once represented.
