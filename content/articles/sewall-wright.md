## Summary

Sewall Wright was an American geneticist who co-founded population genetics with Ronald Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane. He developed the concept of genetic drift and the adaptive landscape metaphor for evolution. His shifting balance theory of evolution proposed that small populations evolving independently could explore new adaptive peaks. Wright's mathematical models were foundational to evolutionary biology.
