## Summary

Cheng Hao was a Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher who, along with his brother Cheng Yi, was one of the founders of the School of Principle (Lixue). He emphasized ren (humaneness) as the key to understanding one's unity with all things. His more intuitive and meditative approach to self-cultivation influenced the later idealist school of Lu Jiuyuan and Wang Yangming. He is known for his teaching that the sage 'forms one body with all things.'
