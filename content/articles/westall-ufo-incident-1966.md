## Summary

The Westall UFO incident is Australia's most significant and controversial mass sighting. On the morning of April 6, 1966, over **200 students and teachers** at Westall High School and Westall State School in Melbourne watched a metallic, saucer-shaped object descend into a nearby grass paddock called "The Grange."

Unlike fleeting sightings, this event lasted for about 20 minutes in broad daylight. The object reportedly landed, took off again, and was pursued by five light aircraft. What followed was a swift and intimidating clean-up operation: the military arrived, the site was burned (ostensibly to remove evidence), and teachers and students were threatened with dire consequences if they spoke to the media.[^1]

## The Incident (April 6, 1966)

### The Sighting (11:00 AM)
During moring recess, students noticed a silver/grey object in the sky.
*   **Description:** It was described as a discoid or bell-shaped craft, about the size of two family cars, glowing with a purple hue.
*   **The Landing:** The object descended behind a grove of pine trees in The Grange reserve. Scores of students jumped the school fence and ran toward the landing site.
*   **The Pursuit:** Witnesses described five smaller planes (possibly Cessnas or military trainers) circling the object, playing a game of "cat and mouse."

### The Evidence
When the students reached the site, they found a circle of flattened, swirled grass where the object had rested. Some reported feeling heat radiating from the ground.
*   **Andrew Greenwood:** A science teacher who witnessed the event tried to calm the hysterical students. He later gave detailed accounts to the press before being silenced.[^2]

## The Cover-up

### The Military Arrival
Within hours, military trucks and personnel arrived.
*   **Scorched Earth:** Witnesses claim the army or emergency services set fire to the grass patch, effectively destroying the landing trace evidence.
*   **Intimidation:** The school principal called a special assembly. Students were told the object was "man-made" (a weather balloon or experimental craft) and forbidden from talking about it.
*   **The Men in Suits:** Teacher Andrew Greenwood claimed that two weeks later, officers from RAAF (Royal Australian Air Force) visited his home and threatened to have him fired and branded a drunk if he continued to discuss the sighting.[^3]

### Missing Media
Channel 9 news reportedly filmed an investigation at the site, interviewing students. However, the footage was never aired. When researchers later searched the archives, the cannisters for that day were allegedly empty or missing.[^4]

## Theories

### Secret Project (HIBAL)
Skeptics and valid government inquiries often point to high-altitude balloon projects (like Project HIBAL) used to monitor radiation levels.
*   **Contradiction:** A runaway balloon might explain the initial sighting, but it does not explain the "cat and mouse" behavior, the rapid ascent, the ground traces, or the heavy-handed military intimidation that followed.

### The "Mystery Plane" Photo
A polaroid photo allegedly taken days earlier in nearby Balwyn shows a bell-shaped object. It is often associated with Westall, though it wasn't taken at the school. It provides a visual reference for what students claimed to see.[^5]

## Legacy

For decades, the Westall incident was a local rumor. In recent years, as the witnesses entered their 50s and 60s, they began to speak out, forming support groups and demanding answers.
*   **2006 Reunion:** A massive reunion of witnesses revealed the shared trauma of the event and the enforced silence.
*   **Westall '66:** A 2010 documentary brought the story to a global audience, solidifying its place as the "Ariel School" incident of Australia.[^6]
