## Summary

Bartolomeo Platina was an Italian Renaissance humanist who served as the first prefect of the Vatican Library. He wrote the Liber de Vita Christi ac Omnium Pontificum, the first comprehensive history of the popes. He was imprisoned twice in Castel Sant'Angelo by Pope Paul II before being rehabilitated by Sixtus IV. His papal history, while sometimes inaccurate, remained the standard reference for centuries.
