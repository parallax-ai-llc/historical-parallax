## Summary

In April 2018, Nicaragua erupted. What began as protests by pensioners against social security cuts became the largest uprising against Daniel Ortega in his 40-year career. For three months, Nicaraguans of all ages built barricades, took over cities, and demanded an end to the Sandinista regime. The government's response was medieval: at least 300 people were killed, many by pro-government paramilitaries shooting into crowds.[^1]

The 2018 Nicaraguan protests caught everyone by surprise, including Ortega himself. The former revolutionary who had once overthrown a dictatorship had become one. Students led the charge, but soon taxi drivers, farmers, housewives, and even former Sandinista supporters joined. They called him "el asesino" (the murderer). But Ortega had learned from other strongmen: he crushed the movement systematically, targeting leaders, killing witnesses, and jailing thousands.[^2]

By the end of 2018, the streets were quiet again—not because Nicaraguans accepted Ortega, but because they feared him. Over 100,000 fled the country. Independent media was shut down. Opposition figures were imprisoned on terrorism charges. Nicaragua became one of the most repressive states in the hemisphere, a warning of what happens when an authoritarian is willing to kill and the world looks away.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Daniel Ortega's Nicaragua

**The Sandinista Revolution (1979):**

- Ortega helped lead overthrow of Somoza dictatorship
- Revolutionary hero
- Lost power in 1990 election

**Return to power (2007):**

- Elected president again
- Gradually consolidated control
- Changed constitution to allow unlimited re-election
- Wife Rosario Murillo became vice president (2017)

**By 2018:**

- Ortega controlled all branches of government
- Supreme Court packed
- Electoral council loyal
- Media increasingly restricted
- But: No major opposition[^4]

### The Trigger

**April 16, 2018:**

- Government announced social security reforms
- Increased worker and employer contributions
- Cut retiree benefits 5%
- Wildfire spread in Indio Maíz reserve (government blamed for slow response)

**Pensioners protested—and were beaten.**

**That beating changed everything.**[^5]

## The Uprising

### Phase 1: Student Rebellion (April 18-22)

**April 18:**

- University students came out in solidarity with pensioners
- Clashes with police and Sandinista Youth
- Students occupied campuses

**April 19:**

- Protests spread nationwide
- Pro-government mobs attacked protesters
- First killings

**April 20-21:**

- Deaths mounted: 30+ in first days
- Ortega appeared on TV, defiant
- Then suddenly reversed: Withdrew social security reform

**But it was too late. The protests had become about Ortega himself.**[^6]

### Phase 2: National Uprising (April 22 - June)

**The demands expanded:**

- Ortega and Murillo must go
- Justice for the dead
- Early elections
- Democratic reform

**The movement:**

- Students led but joined by all sectors
- Business chambers supported strikes
- Catholic Church mediated
- "Autoconvocados" (self-organized) movement

**Barricades ("tranques"):**

- Protesters blocked highways across country
- Communities organized self-defense
- Some cities largely controlled by opposition[^7]

### Phase 3: "Operation Clean-up" (July-August)

**The regime counterattack:**

- Police and paramilitaries ("turbas")
- Systematic assault on barricades
- City by city "liberated"
- Extrajudicial killings; bodies disappeared

**Masaya (July 17-18):**

- Indigenous neighborhood Monimbó resisted longest
- Heavy attack left many dead
- Symbol of resistance

**By August:**

- Barricades cleared
- Leaders fleeing or arrested
- Movement crushed[^8]

## Aftermath

### Immediate Repression

- Farce recognized by almost no one

**Political prisoners:**

- 222 held until 2023

- Civil society destroyed
- Ortega rules unchallenged

**The 2018 dream is dead.**[^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Fail?

**Regime willingness to kill:**

- Paramilitaries had no restraints
- 300+ deaths in months
- Fear worked

**No military defection:**

- Police and military stayed loyal
- Unlike Venezuela, no wavering

**No international intervention:**

- OAS condemned but didn't act
- US under Trump distracted
- Regional powers didn't respond

**Movement limitations:**

- Young, spontaneous
- No organized leadership
- No weapons (unlike 1979)[^12]

### Comparison to 1979

| Factor        | 1979 Revolution   | 2018 Uprising      |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
| Enemy         | Somoza (weaker)   | Ortega (stronger)  |
| Arms          | Sandinistas armed | Protesters unarmed |
| Int'l support | Significant       | Minimal            |
| Military      | Split             | Loyal to regime    |
| Outcome       | Victory           | Defeat             |

**Ortega learned from the revolution he led—and prevented another.**

### Lessons

**What Nicaragua shows:**

- Dictatorships can survive mass protests
- Willingness to kill matters
- International condemnation insufficient
- Timing matters (2018 was different from 1979)[^13]

## Legacy

- Generation traumatized
- Diaspora created
- Opposition destroyed
- Church-state conflict
- One-family rule

### For Latin America

- Alongside Venezuela: Authoritarian survival in 2010s
- Model of repression
- Warning to protesters elsewhere

### The Victims

**Remembered:**

- Monuments abroad
