## Summary

The **Paris massacre of 1961** was a state-sponsored slaughter of peaceful Algerian demonstrators in the heart of the French capital on **October 17, 1961**. Occurring during the violent final months of the Algerian War of Independence, the massacre was orchestrated by the Paris Prefect of Police, **Maurice Papon**. Police officers clubbed protesters to death, shot them, and threw hundreds into the River Seine. For nearly 40 years, the French state censored the event, destroying archives and legally persecuting journalists who tried to investigate. It stands as the deadliest police repression in Western Europe since 1945.

## Context: The "Battle of Paris"

### The War Comes Home
By 1961, the war between the French state and the **National Liberation Front (FLN)** had spilled over from Algeria to mainland France. The FLN targeted French police officers with bombings and shootings; the police responded with "ratonnades" (rat hunts)—raids on Algerian immigrant neighborhoods (bidonvilles) involving arbitrary arrests and torture.

### The Curfew
On October 5, 1961, Maurice Papon issued a discriminatory curfew applicable only to "French Muslims from Algeria." They were forbidden from being outdoors between 8:30 PM and 5:30 AM.
*   **Papon's Orders:** Papon, who notoriously collaborated with the Nazis during the Vichy regime (deporting Jews from Bordeaux), gave his officers a license to kill. He famously told them ahead of the protest: *"For one hit taken, we shall give back ten."* He assured officers that they would be protected from prosecution.

## The Night of October 17

### The Demonstration
To protest the curfew, the FLN organized a massive, peaceful boycott. Some **30,000 Algerians**—men dressed in their Sunday best, women, and children—emerged from the slums of Nanterre and Aubervilliers to march toward the center of Paris. They were strictly ordered by FLN organizers to carry no weapons, not even penknives.

### The Police Attack
As columns of demonstrators reached key locations—**Pont de Neuilly, Pont Saint-Michel, and the Grands Boulevards**—police blocked their paths and attacked.
*   **The Bridges:** At Pont Saint-Michel, police charged with weighted batons (bidules). Skulls were crushed. Unconscious and injured bodies were lifted and thrown over the railings into the freezing Seine.
*   **The Rex Cinema:** On the Grands Boulevards, police opened fire on the crowd.
*   **Police Headquarters:** Inside the courtyard of the Prefecture of Police, apprehended demonstrators were beaten to death.
*   **Graffiti:** In the days following, the famous graffiti appeared on the Seine embankment: *"Ici on noie les Algériens"* (Here we drown Algerians).

## Detention and Torture

Approximately **11,500 people** were arrested that night. They were herded onto buses (often requisitioned RATP city buses) and taken to internment centers:
*   **Palais des Sports:** A sports arena where detainees were held for days without food or medical care. Police officers formed "gantlets" (lines) and beat prisoners as they entered. Executions continued inside the facilities.
*   **Stade Pierre de Coubertin:** Another stadium used as a makeshift prison.

Many of those arrested were later deported to detention camps in Algeria.

## The Great Cover-Up

### Censorship and Lies
On October 18, police reports claimed that the demonstrators had fired first and that only **3 people** had died (two Algerians and one European).
*   **Press Silence:** Newspapers were censored. Issues of *L'Humanité* and *Libération* that attempted to report the massacre were seized by authorities.
*   **Archive Destruction:** Papon and the government systematically sealed or destroyed police archives related to the event to prevent any judicial inquiry.

### The Papon Trial Connection
Maurice Papon continued a successful political career, becoming Budget Minister under President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. It was only in the 1980s that his role in the WWII deportation of Jews was exposed.
*   During his 1997-1998 trial for crimes against humanity (WWII), the 1961 massacre was brought up by historians like **Jean-Luc Einaudi**, who testified that Papon had applied the same administrative brutality to Algerians as he had to Jews. Papon was convicted for his WWII crimes but never tried for 1961 due to amnesty laws.

## Historical Recognition

For decades, the massacre was a taboo subject in France.
*   **1991:** Jean-Luc Einaudi publishes *La Bataille de Paris*, the definitive investigation based on hidden records, proving the death toll was likely between **200 and 300**.
*   **2001:** Bertrand Delanoë, Mayor of Paris, installs a memorial plaque at Pont Saint-Michel.
*   **2012:** President **François Hollande** becomes the first president to acknowledge the "bloody repression."
*   **2021:** President **Emmanuel Macron** attends a memorial ceremony, condemning the crimes as "inexcusable."
