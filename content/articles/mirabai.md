## Summary

Mirabai was a Hindu mystic poet and devotee of Lord Krishna who is one of the most significant poet-saints in Indian history. A Rajput princess, she defied her royal family's wishes to devote her life entirely to Krishna. Her devotional songs (bhajans) express intense longing for the divine beloved and are still widely sung across India. She is regarded as one of the greatest exemplars of bhakti (devotional) tradition.
