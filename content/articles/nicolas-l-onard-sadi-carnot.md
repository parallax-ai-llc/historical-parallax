## Summary

Sadi Carnot was a French military engineer and physicist who is often called the 'father of thermodynamics.' His only publication, 'Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire' (1824), laid the foundations for the second law of thermodynamics and described the Carnot cycle, an idealized heat engine. His work established the theoretical maximum efficiency of heat engines. He died of cholera at age 36.
