## Summary

Swami Vivekananda (1863-1902) was a Hindu monk and chief disciple of the 19th-century Indian mystic Ramakrishna. He played a pivotal role in introducing Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world and is credited with raising interfaith awareness, bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world religion during the late 19th century. His famous speech at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago in 1893 began with the words "Sisters and Brothers of America" and brought him widespread recognition. Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission, which continue to be active in social and spiritual work across India and internationally.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Swami Vivekananda was born as Narendranath Datta on January 12, 1863, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Bengal Presidency, British India, into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family.[^3] His father, Vishwanath Datta, was a successful attorney at the Calcutta High Court with a liberal, progressive outlook and interests in Persian and English literature. His mother, Bhuvaneshwari Devi, was a devout housewife with deep religious inclinations who had a significant influence on young Narendra's spiritual development.[^4]

From his early childhood, Narendranath exhibited extraordinary intellectual capabilities and a rebellious spirit. He was fascinated by wandering ascetics and monks and would often meditate before images of deities such as Shiva, Rama, and Sita. His mother recounted that she had prayed at the Vireshwar Shiva temple in Varanasi to beget a son, and thus considered Narendranath to be a divine gift.[^5]

Narendranath received a multifaceted education. He studied at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution and later at Presidency College, Calcutta, where he was exposed to Western philosophy, history, and science. He was particularly influenced by the works of David Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W.F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, and Auguste Comte.[^6] He also studied Indian classical music and regularly participated in physical exercise, sports, and organizational activities. His education was comprehensive, encompassing Bengali literature, Sanskrit texts, English literature, and Western philosophy, making him one of the most well-educated intellectuals of his time.[^7]

Despite his Western education, Narendranath maintained a deep interest in spirituality and religion. During his college years, he became associated with Brahmo Samaj, a reformist Hindu movement founded by Raja Ram Mohan Roy. However, his questioning mind was not satisfied with abstract philosophical discussions. He sought direct spiritual experience and desperately wanted to meet someone who could confirm from personal experience that God exists. This spiritual quest led him to several prominent spiritual leaders of Calcutta, but none could satisfy his burning question: "Have you seen God?"[^8]

## Rise to Prominence

Narendranath's spiritual transformation began in November 1881 when he met Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa at the Kali Temple in Dakshineshwar.[^9] Unlike other spiritual teachers, when Narendranath posed his persistent question about the existence of God, Ramakrishna unhesitatingly replied, "Yes, I have seen God. I see Him as I see you here, only more clearly."[^10] This direct and confident answer profoundly impacted the young rationalist. Despite his initial skepticism about Ramakrishna's ecstatic devotional practices, Narendranath was gradually drawn to the saint's magnetic personality and spiritual depth.

Over the next five years, Narendranath underwent rigorous spiritual training under Ramakrishna's guidance. Ramakrishna recognized the young man's exceptional potential and carefully molded him for a future leadership role in spreading the message of Vedanta. The relationship between guru and disciple was intense and transformative. Ramakrishna would often go into spiritual ecstasies upon seeing Narendranath and predicted that he would do great work for humanity.[^11]

When Ramakrishna fell terminally ill with throat cancer in 1885, he entrusted the care of his other disciples to Narendranath. After Ramakrishna's death in August 1886, the young disciples, led by Narendranath, formed a new monastic brotherhood. In 1887, they took formal monastic vows, and Narendranath assumed the name "Swami Vivekananda."[^12] The name "Vivekananda" means "the bliss of discerning wisdom" and was suggested by Maharaja Ajit Singh of Khetri.[^13]

From 1888 to 1893, Vivekananda traveled extensively throughout India, living as a wandering monk. During these travels, he witnessed the poverty, suffering, and backwardness of the Indian masses, which deeply affected him. He visited sacred places, met scholars, princes, and common people, and gained firsthand knowledge of the social, economic, and religious conditions of the country. This period of parivrajaka (wandering monk) life shaped his understanding that India's problems were not merely political but deeply rooted in social and spiritual degradation.[^14]

Vivekananda's international prominence came with his participation in the Parliament of the World's Religions held in Chicago from September 11 to 27, 1893.[^15] He arrived in Chicago with insufficient credentials and almost missed the opportunity to participate. However, with the help of Professor John Henry Wright of Harvard University, who reportedly told the Parliament organizers, "To ask for Vivekananda's credentials is like asking the sun to state its right to shine," he was admitted as a representative of Hinduism.[^16]

On September 11, 1893, Vivekananda delivered his first speech at the Parliament, beginning with the now-famous words, "Sisters and brothers of America." This simple greeting received a standing ovation that lasted for two minutes.[^17] His subsequent speeches eloquently presented Hindu philosophy, emphasizing the universality of religions and the need for tolerance and acceptance. The New York Herald wrote: "Vivekananda is undoubtedly the greatest figure in the Parliament of Religions. After hearing him we feel how foolish it is to send missionaries to this learned nation."[^18]

## Major Achievements

Swami Vivekananda's achievements span spiritual, philosophical, educational, and social domains, leaving an indelible mark on both India and the world. His primary accomplishment was introducing Vedanta philosophy and Yoga to the Western world, presenting Hinduism not as a collection of superstitious practices but as a rational, universal, and deeply philosophical system.[^19]

Following his success at the Parliament of Religions, Vivekananda conducted extensive lecture tours across the United States and Europe between 1893 and 1897. He established Vedanta Societies in New York and other American cities, which became centers for the study and practice of Vedanta philosophy.[^20] His lectures attracted intellectuals, scientists, and spiritual seekers, including notable figures like Nikola Tesla, with whom he discussed the connections between Vedantic concepts and modern physics.[^21] His books, including "Raja Yoga," "Karma Yoga," "Bhakti Yoga," and "Jnana Yoga," systematically presented the various paths of yoga to Western audiences, making these ancient practices accessible and relevant to modern seekers.[^22]

Vivekananda's reinterpretation of Hinduism had a profound impact on the Indian independence movement. He challenged the colonial narrative that portrayed Hinduism as inferior and Indians as incapable of self-governance. By presenting India's spiritual traditions as sophisticated and valuable, he instilled a sense of pride and self-confidence in Indians. Leaders of the independence movement, including Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, and Aurobindo Ghose, acknowledged their intellectual debt to Vivekananda.[^23] Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose wrote, "Swamiji harmonized the East and the West, religion and science, past and present. And that is why he is great. Our countrymen have gained unprecedented self-respect, self-confidence, and self-assertion from his teachings."[^24]

Upon returning to India in 1897, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission on May 1, 1897, at Belur Math near Kolkata.[^25] The Mission's motto, "Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Cha" (For one's own salvation and for the welfare of the world), encapsulated his philosophy of practical Vedanta—the idea that spiritual realization must express itself through service to humanity. The Ramakrishna Mission has since grown into a worldwide organization running hundreds of schools, colleges, hospitals, rural development centers, and disaster relief operations.[^26] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Mission provided extensive relief services across India, demonstrating the continuing relevance of Vivekananda's vision of service.[^27]

Vivekananda's educational philosophy emphasized character-building, concentration, and the harmonious development of body, mind, and soul. He famously stated, "Education is the manifestation of the perfection already in man" and advocated for education that would make individuals strong, self-reliant, and capable of serving society.[^28] His ideas influenced the development of educational institutions across India and continue to inspire educational reformers. The Ramakrishna Mission operates over 200 educational institutions, from primary schools to degree colleges, implementing his vision of holistic education.[^29]

His speeches and writings addressed critical social issues of his time, including poverty, caste discrimination, and the status of women. He strongly criticized the caste system's rigidity and advocated for the upliftment of the downtrodden masses, whom he called "Daridra Narayan" (God in the form of the poor).[^30] He declared, "I do not believe in a God who cannot give me bread here, giving me eternal bliss in heaven!" emphasizing the importance of addressing immediate human suffering.[^31] Regarding women, he stated, "There is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved. It is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing," advocating for women's education and empowerment.[^32]

Vivekananda's interfaith dialogue initiatives at the Parliament of Religions set a precedent for respectful religious discourse. His famous statement, "I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance," and his assertion that sectarianism, bigotry, and fanaticism have possessed the earth too long, resonated with audiences worldwide.[^33] His inclusive approach recognized the validity of different religious paths, stating, "As different streams having different sources all mingle their waters in the sea, so different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to God."[^34]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his widespread acclaim, Swami Vivekananda has faced various criticisms and controversies, both during his lifetime and in subsequent historical assessments. Some critics have questioned the authenticity and accuracy of his representation of Hindu philosophy, arguing that his interpretation was significantly influenced by Western thought and did not represent traditional Hinduism accurately.[^35]

Scholars like Richard King have argued that Vivekananda's neo-Vedanta represented a "Protestant" interpretation of Hinduism that emphasized rational philosophy and deemphasized ritualistic practices, idol worship, and the devotional aspects of traditional Hindu practice.[^36] This criticism suggests that Vivekananda created a modernized, Westernized version of Hinduism designed to appeal to Western audiences and respond to Christian missionary criticisms rather than presenting an authentic account of the diverse Hindu traditions. Critics contend that this sanitized version ignored or downplayed aspects of Hinduism that might appear superstitious or irrational to Western observers.[^37]

Vivekananda's position on caste has been subject to contradictory interpretations. While he criticized the rigidity and hereditary aspects of the caste system and called for the upliftment of lower castes, some scholars point out that he never explicitly called for the complete abolition of the varna system.[^38] In some of his writings and speeches, he appeared to defend the original varna system as based on qualities and occupations rather than birth, which some critics interpret as providing ideological cover for the persistence of caste discrimination. Dalit intellectuals and scholars have occasionally criticized his approach as insufficiently radical and accommodating of Brahminical hegemony.[^39]

His views on women, while progressive for his time in advocating for women's education, have been criticized as still operating within patriarchal frameworks. Some feminist scholars argue that Vivekananda's ideal of womanhood was largely confined to the roles of wife and mother, emphasizing domesticity and self-sacrifice rather than complete equality and autonomy.[^40] His veneration of Sita as the ideal Indian woman has been critiqued for perpetuating submissive feminine ideals rather than challenging patriarchal structures fundamentally.[^41]

Vivekananda's relationship with the British colonial government was complex and has been subject to scrutiny. While he inspired Indian nationalists, he avoided direct confrontation with British rule and maintained relationships with British officials and sympathizers.[^42] Some critics argue that his emphasis on spiritual and social reform rather than political action served to deflect energy from anti-colonial struggle during a critical period. Revolutionary nationalists occasionally viewed his approach as too accommodating of British presence in India.[^43]

His statements about Islam and Christianity, while generally respectful, occasionally contained harsh criticisms that have been controversial. Some of his comments about Islamic history and the nature of Islamic society have been criticized as overgeneralizations.[^44] Similarly, his critiques of Christian missionary activities, while defending Hinduism, sometimes employed rhetoric that could be seen as religiously intolerant, contradicting his message of universal acceptance.[^45]

During his time in America, controversies arose regarding his relationships with female disciples and financial supporters. Rumors and innuendos about inappropriate relationships circulated, though these were largely dismissed by his close associates and biographers as malicious gossip.[^46] However, the financial support he received from wealthy Western women, particularly those in his "inner circle," raised questions about the nature of these relationships and whether they influenced his teachings or compromised his monastic ideals.[^47]

Some rationalist and atheist critics in India have questioned Vivekananda's accounts of spiritual experiences, supernatural phenomena, and miraculous events associated with Ramakrishna and himself, viewing them as unscientific and encouraging superstitious thinking.[^48] They argue that while Vivekananda spoke of scientific reasoning, his acceptance of paranormal claims contradicted this stance and hindered the development of rational, scientific temperament in India.[^49]

## Personal Life

Swami Vivekananda's personal life was characterized by an intense dedication to spiritual pursuit and service, marked by both extraordinary discipline and human vulnerabilities. As a monk who had taken vows of celibacy and renunciation, his personal life was theoretically devoted entirely to spiritual practice and humanitarian work, yet he retained deep emotional connections and human concerns that revealed his complex personality.[^50]

Vivekananda maintained close relationships with his monastic brothers who had been fellow disciples of Ramakrishna. His relationship with Swami Brahmananda, whom Ramakrishna had designated as the spiritual leader of the Order, was particularly significant. Despite occasional differences in approach—Brahmananda emphasizing meditation and devotion while Vivekananda focused on practical service—they maintained deep mutual respect.[^51] His correspondence with brother disciples reveals his concern for their welfare and his efforts to keep the organization united despite geographical distances and philosophical differences.[^52]

His relationship with his mother and family remained important throughout his life. Despite taking monastic vows and renouncing worldly attachments, Vivekananda maintained correspondence with his mother and ensured her financial security. After his father's death had left the family in difficult circumstances, Vivekananda's later financial success through his lectures and publications allowed him to provide for his mother and siblings.[^53] This balancing of monastic ideals with family obligations revealed the practical humaneness beneath his philosophical absolutism.

In the West, Vivekananda developed close friendships with several individuals who became his devoted disciples and supporters. His relationship with Margaret Noble, whom he initiated as Sister Nivedita, was particularly significant. Nivedita became one of his most dedicated disciples, moving to India to work for women's education and Indian independence.[^54] Their correspondence reveals a deep mutual respect and affection, with Vivekananda serving as her spiritual guide while she became one of his most effective collaborators in spreading his message.[^55]

Other important Western disciples included Josephine MacLeod, who became a lifelong supporter and friend, and Sara Bull, who provided crucial financial support for his work. His interactions with these women were marked by genuine friendship and spiritual mentorship, though they occasionally sparked gossip and criticism, which caused him distress.[^56] His letters to these disciples reveal not only his spiritual teachings but also his wit, humor, and very human moments of doubt and frustration.

Vivekananda's health was perpetually fragile. He suffered from various ailments including asthma, diabetes, and chronic insomnia, which were likely exacerbated by his rigorous schedule and the physical hardships he endured during his years as a wandering monk.[^57] His illnesses affected his ability to work and travel, causing him considerable frustration. Despite medical advice to rest, he drove himself relentlessly, believing his time was limited and his mission urgent. His letters frequently mention his health struggles and his determination to accomplish his goals despite physical limitations.[^58]

His personality combined seemingly contradictory traits. He could be stern and demanding with his disciples, yet also deeply affectionate and playful. He possessed a razor-sharp intellect and could be devastatingly critical of ideas he considered wrong or harmful, yet he was emotionally sensitive to suffering and could weep at witnessing poverty or injustice.[^59] He loved music, particularly Bengali devotional songs, and would often sing or request songs during informal gatherings. He also enjoyed humor and storytelling, entertaining his disciples with stories from Indian epics and his own experiences.[^60]

In his final years, Vivekananda withdrew somewhat from public activities, spending more time in meditation and contemplation at Belur Math. He seemed to have a premonition of his early death and worked with urgency to ensure the organizational stability of the Ramakrishna Mission. On July 4, 1902, at the age of thirty-nine, he passed away while meditating, reportedly achieving mahasamadhi—a conscious exit from the body according to yogic tradition.[^61] His premature death was attributed to overwork, chronic health issues, and the intense spiritual practices he undertook. He had once predicted that he would not live to be forty, and his prophecy proved accurate.[^62]

## Legacy

Swami Vivekananda's legacy extends across multiple domains—spiritual, philosophical, social, educational, and nationalist—making him one of the most influential figures in modern Indian history and a significant presence in the global spiritual landscape. His impact continues to resonate more than a century after his death, with his birthday (January 12) celebrated as National Youth Day in India since 1984.[^63]

In the spiritual and religious sphere, Vivekananda's primary legacy lies in his revitalization of Hinduism and his successful presentation of Hindu philosophy to the Western world. He transformed the international perception of Hinduism from a collection of exotic and superstitious practices to a sophisticated philosophical system worthy of serious intellectual consideration.[^64] The Vedanta Societies he established in the United States and Europe continue to function, introducing thousands to Hindu philosophy and meditation practices. His interpretation of Vedanta influenced the development of New Age spirituality, comparative religion studies, and the modern yoga movement in the West.[^65]

The Ramakrishna Mission and Ramakrishna Math, the twin organizations he founded, constitute perhaps his most tangible legacy. These institutions have grown into a global organization with over 200 branches worldwide, operating hospitals, schools, colleges, rural development projects, and disaster relief services.[^66] The Mission's work during natural disasters, famines, and epidemics has earned it recognition as one of India's most trusted and effective charitable organizations. Its educational institutions have educated millions, and its hospitals have provided healthcare to countless individuals, embodying Vivekananda's principle of "service to man is service to God."[^67]

In the realm of Indian nationalism, Vivekananda's legacy is profound though sometimes debated. His emphasis on India's spiritual heritage and his message of self-confidence inspired generations of freedom fighters. The entire spectrum of Indian nationalist leaders—from the moderate reformists to revolutionary activists—drew inspiration from his teachings, though they interpreted them differently.[^68] Mahatma Gandhi acknowledged Vivekananda's influence on his thinking, though their approaches differed significantly. More militant nationalists like Aurobindo Ghose and Subhas Chandra Bose saw Vivekananda as providing spiritual and philosophical justification for Indian independence and cultural assertion.[^69]

His educational philosophy has influenced Indian education policy and practice. His emphasis on character-building, physical education, and the integration of traditional Indian knowledge with modern science has been reflected in various educational experiments and reforms.[^70] The National Education Policy of India has incorporated some of his ideas about holistic education and the importance of value-based learning. Numerous schools and colleges across India explicitly follow his educational philosophy, attempting to create institutions that develop not just intellectual capabilities but moral character and social responsibility.[^71]

Vivekananda's legacy in social reform, particularly regarding caste and women's issues, is more contested. While he inspired many social reformers and his organizations have worked for the upliftment of marginalized communities, critics argue that his approach was insufficiently radical and his actual impact on dismantling caste structures was limited.[^72] Nevertheless, his assertion of the dignity and divine potential of every human being provided ideological ammunition for social reform movements, and his call for service to the poor influenced the development of social work in India.[^73]

In the international sphere, Vivekananda is recognized as a pioneer of interfaith dialogue and one of the first major figures to effectively communicate Eastern spirituality to Western audiences. The Parliament of the World's Religions, where he first gained prominence, is often cited as marking the beginning of formal interfaith dialogue, and Vivekananda's approach of respectful acknowledgment of different paths while maintaining one's own tradition has influenced subsequent interfaith initiatives.[^74] His influence on the transmission of yoga and meditation to the West laid the groundwork for the global yoga movement, though the commercial and physical-fitness-oriented forms that yoga often takes in the contemporary West differ significantly from his spiritual vision.[^75]

His intellectual legacy includes his contributions to the interpretation of Vedanta and his effort to harmonize science and spirituality. His assertion that scientific discoveries and spiritual truths are compatible and complementary influenced Indian scientists and philosophers, including figures like Jagadish Chandra Bose.[^76] His lectures and writings demonstrated sophisticated engagement with Western philosophy and showed how Indian philosophical concepts could be articulated in modern intellectual discourse.[^77]

Contemporary India's relationship with Vivekananda's legacy is complex and politically charged. He is claimed by various political and ideological groups, from Hindu nationalists to secular socialists, each emphasizing different aspects of his thought.[^78] Right-wing Hindu nationalist organizations cite his defense of Hinduism and his criticism of aggressive proselytization to support their agenda, while progressive groups emphasize his critique of caste, his concern for the poor, and his scientific rationalism.[^79] This contested legacy reflects both the multifaceted nature of Vivekananda's thought and the tendency of different groups to selectively appropriate historical figures for contemporary political purposes.[^80]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments of Swami Vivekananda have been overwhelmingly positive in India, where he is regarded as one of the nation's greatest sons and a prophet of Indian renaissance. Biographers and hagiographers have presented him as a heroic figure who single-handedly elevated India's image on the world stage and inspired national awakening.[^81]

Romain Rolland, the French Nobel laureate, wrote extensively about Vivekananda and Ramakrishna, describing Vivekananda as "the very soul of India" and stating that his life was "a symphony in which all the great motifs of India's civilization were concentrated."[^82] Rolland's influential biography introduced Vivekananda to European intellectuals and contributed to his recognition as a world figure rather than merely an Indian religious leader.[^83]

Indian scholars and leaders have consistently praised Vivekananda's contributions. Subhas Chandra Bose stated, "Swamiji harmonized the East and the West, religion and science, past and present. And that is why he is great."[^84] Jawaharlal Nehru, despite his secular orientation, acknowledged Vivekananda's impact, writing in "The Discovery of India" that Vivekananda's message "influenced our national movement and gave it a touch of the universal."[^85] Mahatma Gandhi, though he had theological differences with Vivekananda, admitted, "I have gone through his works very thoroughly, and after having gone through them, the love that I had for my country became a thousandfold."[^86]

Contemporary scholars have highlighted Vivekananda's role in postcolonial theory and the deconstruction of Orientalist frameworks. Partha Chatterjee and other historians of Indian nationalism have analyzed how Vivekananda's reinterpretation of Hindu tradition created a counter-narrative to colonial characterizations of Indian culture as stagnant and superstitious.[^87] By presenting Hinduism as rational, scientific, and universal, he challenged Western epistemic authority and provided ideological resources for anti-colonial resistance.[^88]

Religious studies scholars have praised Vivekananda's contributions to comparative religion and interfaith understanding. Diana Eck of Harvard University has noted that Vivekananda's Parliament of Religions address marked a turning point in American religious pluralism, introducing Americans to Hindu philosophy as a legitimate spiritual alternative.[^89] His inclusive theology, which recognized the validity of different religious paths while advocating for mutual respect and learning, has been seen as anticipating later developments in pluralistic theology and interfaith dialogue.[^90]

Educational theorists have found much to appreciate in Vivekananda's educational philosophy. His emphasis on character development, concentration, and the integration of physical, mental, and spiritual education has been praised as holistic and ahead of its time.[^91] His critique of rote learning and examination-focused education resonates with contemporary educational reformers seeking more meaningful and transformative pedagogical approaches.[^92]

Scholars of yoga and meditation have acknowledged Vivekananda's crucial role in introducing these practices to the West. His book "Raja Yoga," which systematically explained Patanjali's Yoga Sutras and meditation techniques, became a foundational text for Western practitioners.[^93] While the commercialization and dilution of yoga in the West is often criticized, Vivekananda is generally credited with preserving the spiritual core of these practices even while making them accessible to Western audiences.[^94]

### Negative Views

Critical scholarly assessment of Vivekananda has emerged from various quarters, challenging hagiographical narratives and examining problematic aspects of his thought and legacy. Postcolonial scholars have offered more nuanced and sometimes critical readings of his work.

Wilhelm Halbfass and other historians of philosophy have critiqued Vivekananda's interpretation of Vedanta as historically inaccurate and overly influenced by Western categories.[^95] They argue that his neo-Vedanta bears limited resemblance to classical Advaita Vedanta as articulated by Adi Shankara and represents a modern, syncretistic creation designed to respond to Western critiques and appeal to Western sensibilities.[^96] This criticism suggests that Vivekananda's "authentic Hinduism" was itself a colonial construction, shaped more by the encounter with the West than by continuity with pre-colonial traditions.[^97]

Rationalist and secular critics in India have questioned the appropriateness of celebrating a religious figure as a national icon, arguing that it conflates religious identity with national identity in problematic ways.[^98] Organizations like the Rationalist International have criticized the adulation of Vivekananda as promoting superstitious thinking and religious dogmatism rather than scientific rationality.[^99] They point to his acceptance of supernatural phenomena and miraculous occurrences as contradicting his claims to scientific thinking.[^100]

Dalit intellectuals and scholars have offered pointed critiques of Vivekananda's position on caste. While acknowledging his criticism of caste rigidity, they argue that he failed to fundamentally challenge Brahminical hegemony and in some ways reinforced it by defending the varna system as originally meritocratic.[^101] Compared to contemporaries like Jyotirao Phule or later figures like B.R. Ambedkar, who advocated for the complete annihilation of caste, Vivekananda's approach appears reformist rather than radical.[^102] Some Dalit scholars view his emphasis on spiritual equality as deflecting from material and social inequality, arguing that assertions that "all souls are equal" ring hollow when social hierarchies remain unchallenged.[^103]

Feminist scholars have offered mixed assessments of Vivekananda's views on women. While crediting him with advocating for women's education, critics note that his vision of women's roles remained largely traditional and confined to domestic spheres.[^104] His idealization of Sita and his emphasis on women as mothers and preservers of cultural values has been critiqued as reinforcing patriarchal gender roles rather than challenging them.[^105] Uma Chakravarti and other feminist historians have argued that the "spiritual feminism" of figures like Vivekananda, while granting women dignity in traditional roles, actually hindered the development of more radical feminist movements that challenged patriarchal structures fundamentally.[^106]

Some scholars have critically examined Vivekananda's relationship with Western women, questioning whether the financial and organizational dependence on wealthy female patrons created asymmetries of power that complicated his monastic identity.[^107] While stopping short of accepting salacious rumors, critical biographers have noted that his relationships with women like Sara Bull and Josephine MacLeod were emotionally intense and financially significant, raising questions about how these relationships influenced his message and his organization.[^108]

Political scientists and historians have debated Vivekananda's legacy in relation to contemporary Hindu nationalism. While Vivekananda himself did not advocate religious chauvinism and emphasized universal brotherhood, critics argue that his defense of Hindu culture and his criticism of proselytizing religions have been appropriated by right-wing Hindu nationalist movements to justify intolerance and majoritarianism.[^109] Scholars like Jyotirmaya Sharma have analyzed how Vivekananda's assertive Hindu identity, while understandable in the colonial context, has been reinterpreted in the postcolonial period to support exclusivist politics.[^110] Critics contend that his legacy is thus implicated in communal violence and religious polarization, however unintentional this connection might be.[^111]

Some critics have questioned the practical effectiveness of Vivekananda's approach. Despite his inspiring rhetoric about serving the poor and uplifting the masses, they argue that the Ramakrishna Mission's actual impact on poverty and inequality has been limited, functioning more as a charitable organization providing palliative care rather than addressing structural injustices.[^112] From this perspective, Vivekananda's emphasis on spiritual solutions to social problems deflected attention from the economic and political changes necessary to address poverty and inequality effectively.[^113]
