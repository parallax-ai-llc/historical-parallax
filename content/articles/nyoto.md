## Summary

Lukman Njoto (17 January 1927 – 13 December 1965) was a senior leader of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), serving as Second Deputy Chairman of the Central Committee and a key intellectual figure in Indonesian politics during the Sukarno era. Born into an aristocratic Javanese family, Njoto became one of the founding members of Lekra (Institute for the People's Culture), the world's largest non-state cultural organization, and served as editor of the PKI newspaper Harian Rakyat. Known for his pragmatic and non-dogmatic approach to communism, Njoto was a trusted advisor to President Sukarno, writing many of his speeches and coining the term "Sukarnoism." He was arrested and executed on 13 December 1965 during the anti-communist purge that followed the failed September 30th Movement, becoming one of approximately 500,000 to 1 million victims of Indonesia's mass killings.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Njoto was born on 17 January 1927 in the house of his grandfather, Marjono, in Jember, East Java. His father, Raden Sosro Hartono, was a descendant of the Surakarta (Solo) royal family, placing Njoto within Indonesia's aristocratic elite. His mother was Masalmah. The title "Raden" indicates nobility of blood by birth, whether from royalty or feudal nobility, and Raden Sosro Hartono was respected as a Solo noble descendant. This aristocratic background was unusual for a communist leader and would later inform Njoto's unique position within the PKI leadership.[^4][^5]

Njoto and his sister Windarti attended the Hollands Inlandsche School (HIS) in Jember, where they received Dutch colonial education. They lived with their maternal grandparents in Kampung Tempean, Jember, during their schooling years. During his time in MULO (Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs, a Dutch-language middle school), the young Njoto began reading communist literature, including works by Karl Marx, Joseph Stalin, and Vladimir Lenin. This early exposure to Marxist thought would profoundly shape his intellectual development and political trajectory.[^6]

As a teenager during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945), Njoto witnessed the end of Dutch colonial rule and the emergence of Indonesian nationalism. The Japanese occupation created conditions for the independence movement to flourish, and young intellectuals like Njoto found themselves drawn to revolutionary ideas. By the time Indonesia declared independence on 17 August 1945, Njoto was eighteen years old and ready to commit himself to the revolutionary cause. He was involved in the Battle of Surabaya against the British forces in November 1945, one of the defining moments of the Indonesian National Revolution.[^7][^8]

In early 1948, during the Indonesian National Revolution, Njoto worked alongside D.N. Aidit and M.H. Lukman to translate The Communist Manifesto into Indonesian, marking his emergence as a young communist intellectual. This translation work was part of the PKI's effort to make Marxist theory accessible to Indonesian workers and peasants. By August 1948, the PKI Central Committee had assigned specific responsibilities to its young leaders: Aidit handled land affairs, Lukman managed agitation and propaganda, and Njoto was responsible for relations with other organizations. Around this same time, Njoto was appointed to the Politburo, despite being only twenty-one years old.[^9][^10]

## Rise to Power

During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949), Njoto became a representative of the PKI Banyuwangi branch and was appointed as a member of the Central Indonesian National Committee (KNIP), a body created to assist the president of the newly independent Indonesia. The KNIP served as a temporary legislative body until elections could be held. In March 1947, after KNIP held a meeting in Malang, Aidit was elected as chairman of the PKI faction, while Njoto was elected as chairman of Badan Pekerja KNIP (the Working Committee of KNIP), giving him significant political influence at a young age.[^11][^12]

The Madiun Affair of September 1948 proved to be a catastrophic setback for the PKI. Communist forces in Madiun, East Java, launched an uprising that was crushed by government troops loyal to Sukarno, resulting in the deaths of many PKI leaders and thousands of party members. However, the younger generation of PKI leaders, including Njoto, Aidit, Lukman, and Sudisman, survived this purge. These four young Politburo members would later replace the old guard and rebuild the party from near destruction.[^13]

On 7 January 1951, at a crucial Central Committee meeting, Njoto was elected to the Politburo alongside Aidit, Sudisman, Alimin, and Lukman. This marked the formal beginning of the new PKI leadership. Also in January 1951, Njoto was appointed to the editorial staff of Bintang Merah (Red Star), a theoretical journal first published on 15 August 1950. In July 1951, the PKI appointed Njoto to supervise the content of the party newspaper Harian Rakyat (People's Daily), which had begun publication on 31 January 1951. Njoto would later become the newspaper's editor-in-chief in 1953, taking over from founder Siauw Giok Tjhan.[^14][^15][^16]

On 17 August 1950, coinciding with the fifth anniversary of Indonesian independence, Njoto joined D.N. Aidit, M.S. Ashar, and A.S. Dharta in founding Lembaga Kebudayaan Rakyat (Lekra, or Institute for the People's Culture). Lekra became the cultural wing of the PKI and advocated for socialist realism in the arts. It was arguably the world's largest cultural organization not affiliated with a state, with over 200,000 members and 1.5 million supporters. Lekra provided extensive space in Harian Rakyat for works by communist artists and writers, and Njoto personally wrote cultural criticism under the pen name "Iramani," using a softer and more poetic style than his sharper political writing in Bintang Merah.[^17][^18][^19]

After a Central Committee meeting in October 1953, the three young leaders consolidated their control: Aidit became secretary general (later renamed chairman), with Lukman as First Deputy Chairman and Njoto as Second Deputy Chairman. This triumvirate would lead the PKI through its most successful period. Under their leadership, the party grew from approximately 10,000 members in 1951 to over three million cadres by 1965, with an additional 20 million people in its mass organizations covering youth, women, peasants, and workers. By the early 1960s, the PKI was the third-largest communist party in the world, after those of the Soviet Union and China.[^20][^21]

## Major Achievements

Njoto's most significant achievement was his role in rebuilding and expanding the Communist Party of Indonesia into a mass movement. Between 1951 and 1965, under the collective leadership of Aidit, Lukman, and Njoto, the PKI transformed from a decimated organization into Indonesia's largest political party. The party operated through a sophisticated network of mass organizations including labor unions, peasant associations, women's groups, and youth movements. Njoto's particular responsibility for relations with other organizations made him crucial to this expansion.[^22]

As editor-in-chief of Harian Rakyat from 1953 onwards, Njoto transformed the newspaper into a major voice in Indonesian public discourse. One of his primary tasks was writing editorials for the newspaper, shaping the party's message on daily political events. Harian Rakyat was managed by Njoto as a member of the editorial board, with Mula Naibaho serving as managing editor. The newspaper became known for its coverage of social justice issues, anti-imperialist struggles, and advocacy for land reform. It provided a platform for Lekra artists and writers, helping to create a vibrant communist cultural movement.[^23][^24]

Njoto's intellectual contributions to Indonesian Marxism were substantial. On 1 August 1956, he spoke to Central Committee members about the need to educate party cadres on ideology, given the rapid increase in membership. His major work, "Strive for the Victory of the Indonesian Revolution With the Weapon of Dialectical and Historical Materialism," delivered in 1964, argued that the Indonesian Communist Party needed dialectical and historical materialism as an ideological weapon for the masses. He emphasized that victory would come through combining theory with practice, linking with the masses, and practicing self-criticism. This speech was published in June 1964 and circulated widely within the party.[^25][^26]

In 1962, Njoto published "Marxisme: Ilmu dan Amalnya" (Marxism: The Science and Its Practice), which became an important text for party education. He argued that dialectical and historical materialism had to fight not only idealism but also various philosophies distorting socialism. Njoto formulated Indonesia's revolutionary goals clearly: the enemies were imperialism and feudalism, making the revolution a national-democratic revolution, with workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie and national bourgeoisie united in a national front, with the worker-peasant alliance as its basis and the proletariat as its leader, to establish a people's democracy as a transitional stage toward socialism.[^27][^28]

Njoto's relationship with President Sukarno represented one of his most remarkable achievements. Unlike other PKI leaders, Njoto enjoyed Sukarno's personal trust and friendship. According to Joesoef Isak, Njoto was the only PKI leader who was "liberal," pragmatical, and not dogmatic, which appealed to Sukarno. The president called him "dik" (younger brother) instead of the more formal "Bung" (comrade), indicating genuine affection. Sukarno also called Njoto a "true Marhaenist," connecting him to Sukarno's own nationalist ideology. This close relationship stemmed from Njoto's ability to bridge communist ideology with Indonesian nationalism.[^29][^30]

Njoto became Sukarno's speechwriter, crafting some of the president's most important addresses. Most notably, Njoto wrote Sukarno's speech for Independence Day on 17 August 1965, which addressed corruption and counter-revolutionaries. This speech would prove to be one of Sukarno's last major addresses before the September 30th Movement. Historian John Roosa noted that "Sukarno was indeed close with the party's deputy chairman, Njoto, but the president didn't like its senior leader, D.N. Aidit, who was regarded as too ambitious." This personal connection gave Njoto unique influence over government policy.[^31][^32]

In April 1964, Njoto coined the term "Sukarnoisme" (Sukarnoism) in a speech in Palembang. According to Tempo magazine, Njoto invented this term because most Indonesian farmers didn't understand Marxism, but they revered Sukarno. By framing communist ideas as "Sukarnoism," Njoto made leftist policies more palatable to the nationalist masses. This created controversy within the PKI, with some viewing it as ideological dilution, but it proved effective in expanding the party's influence. Historian Iskandar Subekti noted that "Aidit considered that Njoto was more a Sukarnoist than a communist," highlighting tensions within the party leadership.[^33][^34]

In March 1962, Njoto and Aidit were appointed as ministers without portfolio in the cabinet, giving the PKI formal representation in government for the first time since the Madiun Affair. These were coordinating or advisory roles, but they marked the PKI's integration into Sukarno's "Guided Democracy" system, which was based on NASAKOM—the unity of nationalism (nasionalisme), religion (agama), and communism (komunisme). Between 1963 and 1964, Njoto traveled to the Soviet Union several times to establish links between the PKI and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, though the PKI was increasingly aligning with China in the Sino-Soviet split.[^35][^36]

In September 1964, after Sukarno was appointed president for life by the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPRS), Njoto was appointed as state minister in the Dwikora Cabinet with responsibility for supervision of land reform. This was a crucial portfolio, as land reform was a central demand of the PKI's peasant base. According to a PKI report from April 1964, Njoto attended a large meeting of farmers in Klaten where he stated that "the land reform law could only be reached by people's actions and a patriotic and democratic government." As minister, Njoto worked to implement agrarian reform policies that would redistribute land from large landowners to poor peasants.[^37][^38]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Njoto's aristocratic background created contradictions that critics highlighted throughout his career. Born into the Surakarta royal family with the noble title "Raden," Njoto theoretically represented the feudal class that communism sought to overthrow. Conservative opponents questioned how an aristocrat could authentically represent workers and peasants. Even within the PKI, some viewed his privileged upbringing as incompatible with proletarian leadership. However, Njoto's defenders pointed to other aristocratic revolutionaries like Friedrich Engels, and argued that class origin mattered less than class commitment.[^39]

Within the PKI leadership, Njoto faced criticism for being insufficiently communist. D.N. Aidit, the party's secretary-general, reportedly did not invite Njoto to some Politburo meetings. According to historian John Roosa, "Aidit considered that Njoto was more a Sukarnoist than a communist." This tension reflected genuine ideological differences: while Aidit favored militant class struggle and alignment with China, Njoto emphasized pragmatic cooperation with nationalist forces and maintained ties with the Soviet Union. Some party hardliners viewed Njoto's flexibility as opportunism rather than tactical wisdom.[^40]

Njoto's coining of the term "Sukarnoism" in 1964 provoked controversy within the party. Orthodox Marxists argued that inventing a new ideology diluted scientific socialism and created a personality cult around Sukarno. They worried that subordinating Marxism to Sukarnoism would make the party dependent on a bourgeois nationalist leader rather than building independent working-class power. These critics proved prescient: when Sukarno fell from power after 1965, the PKI's close association with him contributed to its destruction.[^41]

The PKI's land reform campaigns, which Njoto supervised as minister, generated intense opposition from landowners, the military, and Islamic organizations. In rural areas of Java, PKI activists conducted "unilateral actions" (aksi sepihak) to seize land and redistribute it to peasants, bypassing legal procedures. These actions, which Njoto endorsed in his statement that land reform "could only be reached by people's actions," antagonized local elites and created violent conflicts. Military officers, many of whom came from landlord families or had acquired land themselves, viewed land reform as a direct threat to their interests.[^42]

Njoto's role in Lekra also attracted criticism from non-communist artists and intellectuals. Lekra's promotion of socialist realism and its denunciation of "art for art's sake" was seen by many Indonesian writers and artists as prescriptive and limiting. The Manifesto Kebudayaan (Cultural Manifesto) group, which opposed Lekra's approach, accused the organization of political interference in cultural matters. The rivalry between Lekra and non-communist cultural groups contributed to the polarized atmosphere of the early 1960s. After 1965, this cultural conflict would be used to justify violence against Lekra members.[^43]

Some contemporary scholars have questioned whether the PKI's strategy under Njoto, Aidit, and Lukman was fundamentally flawed. The party's decision to align closely with Sukarno and work within the existing state structure, rather than maintaining revolutionary independence, left it vulnerable when the political winds shifted. Historian Benedict Anderson and others have argued that the PKI's parliamentary strategy and reliance on Sukarno's protection demonstrated political naïveté. When the military moved against the party in October 1965, the PKI had no contingency plans and its members were systematically identified through their involvement in mass organizations.[^44]

Njoto's personal style also drew criticism from some quarters. Writer Iwan Simatupang described Njoto as "an intellectual and philosophical snob," suggesting that his erudition and aristocratic manner created distance from ordinary party members. While this characterization may reflect anti-communist bias, it points to a real tension: Njoto was more comfortable in intellectual circles and government offices than in peasant villages or factory floors. His writing in Harian Rakyat under the pen name "Iramani" used "a softer and more poetic style" than typical communist rhetoric, which some party members found insufficiently militant.[^45]

The PKI's relationship with the Soviet Union versus China became increasingly problematic in the early 1960s as the Sino-Soviet split deepened. While Aidit leaned toward China, Njoto maintained closer ties with the Soviet Union, which some viewed as supporting Soviet "revisionism" rather than revolutionary purity. This internal division over foreign alignment weakened party unity at a crucial moment. After 1965, some survivors blamed the leadership's foreign policy disputes for distracting from domestic organizational needs.[^46]

## Personal Life

Information about Njoto's personal and family life remains limited, partly because much documentation was destroyed after 1965 and partly because communist leaders of his era maintained strict separation between private life and public politics. The sources mention that he had at least one relative named Iramani, under whose name some accounts state he was arrested. This may also have been a pen name he used for his cultural writings in Harian Rakyat, where he employed "a softer and more poetic style" for his articles on literature and arts.[^47]

Njoto's living situation during his time as a minister in Jakarta is not well documented, but he would have resided in the capital during the 1960s when serving in government positions. His aristocratic family background meant he was likely more comfortable in urban, elite circles than many of his PKI comrades. Writer Iwan Simatupang's characterization of Njoto as "an intellectual and philosophical snob" suggests someone who valued learning and cultural refinement, characteristics that may have stemmed from his privileged upbringing in the Surakarta noble family.[^48]

According to historian accounts, Njoto was described by colleagues as the most "liberal," pragmatic, and non-dogmatic of the PKI leaders. This personality trait made him uniquely effective as a bridge between the communist party and nationalist circles. His ability to adapt Marxist language to Indonesian contexts—exemplified by his coining of "Sukarnoism"—reflected intellectual flexibility rather than rigid ideological thinking. These personal qualities made him Sukarno's favorite among PKI leaders, with the president using the affectionate term "dik" (younger brother) rather than the formal "Bung" (comrade).[^49]

Njoto's daily work combined journalism, party organizing, cultural activity, and government responsibilities. As editor of Harian Rakyat, he wrote editorials and supervised content. As a Politburo member, he attended high-level party meetings. As a Lekra founder, he engaged with artists, writers, and cultural debates. As a minister, he worked on land reform policy. This demanding schedule left little time for personal life. One contemporary noted that Njoto "had more influence than Lukman and Aidit" despite being second deputy chairman, suggesting his effectiveness came from personal relationships and intellectual persuasion rather than formal authority.[^50]

His pen name "Iramani" allowed Njoto to explore literary and cultural themes with a voice distinct from his political writing. Under this name in Harian Rakyat, he wrote about literature, arts, and culture using poetic language rather than political slogans. This dual identity—tough Marxist theoretician in Bintang Merah, sensitive cultural critic as Iramani—revealed psychological complexity. Njoto understood that culture and emotion mattered as much as economic analysis in moving people to action. The roots of his thought, according to researchers, lay in "his political alignments toward the lower class, with the major theme of his ideas being about people liberation from oppression."[^51]

## Legacy

Njoto's death on 13 December 1965 marked one of the pivotal moments in Indonesia's bloodiest period. According to different accounts, he was either shot dead in Tanjung Priok or Bekasi, or killed in Jakarta with his corpse thrown into the Ciliwung River. Historian Bonnie Triana supports the latter account. The circumstances of his arrest also vary: some sources state he was arrested in Tosari, Menteng, while Irina Dayasih claims he was arrested while leaving the Ministry of State office in December 1965. His remains have never been found, and like hundreds of thousands of other victims, he has no marked grave. This absence of a burial site symbolizes how thoroughly the New Order regime under Suharto attempted to erase the PKI from Indonesian memory.[^52][^53]

The mass killings of 1965-66 that claimed Njoto's life remain one of the 20th century's worst atrocities. Most scholars now agree that at least 500,000 people were killed, though estimates range as high as 1.5 million. Robert Cribb suggests 500,000 is the most accurate figure, while Benedict Anderson concluded that between 500,000 and 1 million died. The Indonesian Army initially estimated 78,500 killed, while the PKI claimed two million; later the Army revised its estimate to one million. These killings targeted not only PKI leaders like Njoto, but ordinary party members, members of mass organizations, suspected sympathizers, and many who had no connection to communism but were caught in the violence.[^54][^55]

Lekra, which Njoto co-founded in 1950, was banned by Suharto's New Order government along with all other PKI-associated organizations. For decades, even mentioning Lekra or discussing its cultural legacy was dangerous in Indonesia. However, in recent years, there has been renewed scholarly and artistic interest in Lekra's contributions to Indonesian culture. The Tricontinental Institute's 2020 dossier "The Legacy of Lekra: Organising Revolutionary Culture in Indonesia" argues that Lekra represented an important model of popular cultural organizing. Martin Aleida, interviewed about Lekra, stated that "the Lekra spirit lives" in contemporary Indonesian social movements seeking to connect art with grassroots organizing.[^56][^57]

The rehabilitation of Njoto's reputation has been slow and incomplete. For 32 years under Suharto's New Order (1966-1998), any association with the PKI was criminalized, and victims' families faced systematic discrimination. Children and grandchildren of PKI members were barred from government employment and military service. School textbooks portrayed the PKI as traitors who attempted a coup, with no mention of the mass killings that followed. Njoto was depicted as a villain in this official history. Only after Suharto's fall in 1998 did space open for alternative narratives, though Indonesian society remains deeply divided about how to remember 1965.[^58]

Some contemporary Indonesian leftists view Njoto as a martyr for social justice and a victim of Cold War violence backed by the United States. Declassified documents show that U.S. officials knew about and supported the anti-communist killings, providing names of PKI members to the Indonesian military. In this view, Njoto and the PKI represented a democratic path toward socialism that was destroyed through mass murder with Western complicity. His writings on dialectical materialism, land reform, and cultural organizing remain studied by Indonesian activists seeking to understand their country's suppressed radical traditions.[^59][^60]

International scholars of Indonesian history have generally portrayed Njoto more favorably than D.N. Aidit. While Aidit is often depicted as rigid and dogmatic, Njoto is remembered for his intellectual sophistication, cultural sensitivity, and political pragmatism. John Roosa's assessment that "Aidit considered that Njoto was more a Sukarnoist than a communist" is often cited to suggest Njoto understood Indonesia's political realities better than his more doctrinaire comrades. Some scholars argue that if Njoto's approach had prevailed over Aidit's, the PKI might have avoided the catastrophic confrontation with the military.[^61]

The question of whether the 1965-66 killings constitute genocide remains contested among scholars. Some argue the massacres meet the definition because "the PKI constitute an ideologically-based national group," while others note that the United Nations definition of genocide does not include targeting political groups. This debate affects how Njoto and other PKI victims are remembered: as casualties of political conflict, victims of mass murder, or victims of genocide. The Indonesian government has refused to formally apologize or conduct truth and reconciliation processes, leaving these questions unresolved.[^62]

Njoto's intellectual legacy is preserved primarily in materials available through the Marxist Internet Archive, which hosts his 1964 speech "Strive for the Victory of the Indonesian Revolution With the Weapon of Dialectical and Historical Materialism" and other writings. These texts remain relevant for scholars studying Indonesian communism, Cold War history, and socialist thought in postcolonial contexts. His analysis of imperialism and feudalism as Indonesia's primary enemies, and his formulation of a national democratic revolution with a worker-peasant alliance, reflected a sophisticated application of Marxist theory to Indonesian conditions.[^63]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars sympathetic to the PKI and critical of the 1965-66 violence have portrayed Njoto as one of Indonesia's most promising political intellectuals, whose life was cut short by an anti-communist massacre backed by Cold War geopolitics. These historians emphasize that the PKI under Njoto, Aidit, and Lukman built the world's largest non-ruling communist party through democratic organizing rather than violence. With three million members and 20 million supporters by 1965, the party demonstrated genuine popular support. Njoto's ability to bridge communist ideology and Indonesian nationalism showed political sophistication that contrasted with rigid dogmatism.[^64]

Historians like John Roosa have highlighted Njoto's unique qualities within the PKI leadership. His non-dogmatic approach, cultural sophistication, and close relationship with Sukarno represented a distinct political style that might have led the party in a more sustainable direction. Roosa and others note that Sukarno trusted Njoto in ways he never trusted Aidit, suggesting Njoto could have mediated between the left and nationalist forces. The fact that a Javanese aristocrat became a genuine advocate for peasants and workers demonstrated how deeply committed he was to social justice principles.[^65]

Researchers studying Njoto's writings have found substantial intellectual depth in his work. His formulation that Indonesia needed a "national democratic revolution" with a "worker-peasant alliance" leading toward socialism showed sophisticated understanding of Marxist theory and Indonesian conditions. His emphasis on dialectical and historical materialism as tools for mass education rather than elite theory reflected pedagogical commitment. His argument that theory must be combined with practice, linked to the masses, and subjected to self-criticism anticipated later leftist critiques of vanguardism.[^66]

Cultural historians have increasingly recognized Njoto's contributions to Indonesian arts and literature through his role in founding and leading Lekra. The Tricontinental Institute's 2020 dossier on Lekra argues that the organization represented "the vanguard of communist cultural work" and created models for connecting art with popular organizing that remain relevant. With over 200,000 members and 1.5 million supporters, Lekra was likely "the world's largest cultural organization not affiliated with a state." Njoto's vision of culture as central to political transformation, not merely propaganda, influenced generations of Indonesian artists.[^67]

Some scholars have emphasized Njoto's role as Sukarno's speechwriter as evidence of his importance to Indonesian nationalism as well as communism. The speeches Njoto wrote, including Sukarno's August 17, 1965 Independence Day address on corruption and counter-revolutionaries, demonstrated his ability to articulate populist themes that resonated across ideological boundaries. His coining of "Sukarnoism" showed creative political thinking: by translating Marxist concepts into a framework honoring Indonesia's independence leader, Njoto made radical ideas accessible to peasants who might not understand abstract theory.[^68]

Defenders of Njoto's legacy argue that his assassination and the destruction of the PKI represented a tragedy not only for Indonesian leftists but for Indonesian democracy. The extrajudicial killings of 500,000 to 1 million people destroyed Indonesia's largest political party without due process, eliminating a major voice for workers, peasants, and the poor. The subsequent 32-year dictatorship under Suharto, characterized by repression, corruption, and inequality, demonstrated what Indonesia lost when it destroyed rather than debated its left wing. Njoto and his comrades deserved to face their accusers in court, not bullets in the dark.[^69]

Human rights advocates emphasize that Njoto and other 1965-66 victims deserve justice and remembrance. The Indonesian government's refusal to acknowledge, investigate, or apologize for the killings perpetuates historical injustice. Organizations like the Tribunal 1965 have worked to document testimonies, identify perpetrators, and demand accountability. In this view, Njoto represents all victims of Cold War violence who were killed for their political beliefs. His story challenges the narrative that Western-backed anti-communist campaigns represented freedom's triumph; instead, they often meant mass murder of civilians.[^70]

### Negative Views

Conservative Indonesian historians and political figures continue to view Njoto and the PKI as traitors who attempted to overthrow Indonesia's government and deserved the military response they received. This perspective, dominant during the Suharto era and still influential, holds that the September 30th Movement was a PKI coup attempt that killed six generals. In this narrative, the subsequent violence was a spontaneous popular uprising against communist treachery, not an organized massacre. Njoto, as second deputy chairman of the PKI, bore responsibility for the party's actions and cannot be separated from its alleged conspiracy.[^71]

Critics emphasize that the PKI under Njoto and Aidit operated as a totalitarian organization that would have established a communist dictatorship had it gained power. They point to the PKI's alignment with China during the Cultural Revolution, its advocacy of land seizures that violated property rights, and its promotion of class struggle that divided Indonesian society. In this view, Njoto's pragmatism and cultural sophistication were merely sophisticated tactics to disguise authoritarian intentions. His close relationship with Sukarno represented manipulation of an aging president rather than genuine partnership.[^72]

Some scholars critical of the PKI argue that the party's strategy was reckless and led to catastrophe. By conducting "unilateral actions" to seize land, building mass organizations that threatened established institutions, and aligning closely with China during its most radical period, the PKI provoked powerful enemies including the military, landowners, and Islamic organizations. Njoto, as minister responsible for land reform supervision, actively encouraged policies that antagonized these forces. The party leadership's failure to anticipate or prepare for military repression demonstrated political incompetence that cost millions of lives and suffering.[^73]

Anti-communist scholars have questioned whether Njoto genuinely represented workers and peasants or used them for party power. His aristocratic background, intellectual manner, and comfort in elite circles suggested someone motivated by ideology and ambition rather than lived experience of poverty. Critics note that PKI leaders like Njoto lived relatively comfortable lives while urging others to revolutionary sacrifice. The party's hierarchical structure, with intellectuals providing theory and masses providing numbers, replicated class divisions that communism theoretically opposed.[^74]

Some historians argue that the PKI's cultural work through Lekra, which Njoto led, represented authoritarian interference in artistic freedom rather than cultural liberation. Lekra's insistence on socialist realism and denunciation of "art for art's sake" attempted to subordinate creativity to political messaging. Artists who disagreed with Lekra faced pressure, ostracism, and in some cases violence from PKI members. The Cultural Manifesto group's opposition to Lekra reflected genuine concern about artistic autonomy, not merely anti-communist prejudice. Njoto's cultural legacy thus includes intolerance as well as popularization.[^75]

Scholars skeptical of Njoto's reputation have noted that his relationship with Sukarno involved writing speeches that promoted personality cult and authoritarianism. Sukarno's Guided Democracy system, which Njoto supported, undermined parliamentary institutions and concentrated power. By helping Sukarno articulate populist nationalism that marginalized liberal democrats and socialists independent of the PKI, Njoto contributed to the destruction of democratic norms. His pragmatism meant accommodating authoritarian tendencies rather than defending democratic principles.[^76]

Some critics within the left have argued that the PKI's strategy of alliance with the "national bourgeoisie" represented by Sukarno was a fundamental error that Njoto particularly embodied. Revolutionary Marxists argue that genuine socialism requires working-class independence from bourgeois forces, not coalition with them. By subordinating the party to Sukarno and working within state structures, Njoto and other PKI leaders abandoned revolutionary principles. When the military struck, the party had neither ideological clarity nor organizational independence to resist. The catastrophe of 1965-66 thus resulted partly from the reformist strategy Njoto championed.[^77]

Military historians and Indonesian nationalists have emphasized that the PKI threatened Indonesia's national unity and stability. The party's promotion of class struggle conflicted with Pancasila's principle of social harmony. Its alignment with China positioned it as an agent of foreign interests rather than authentic Indonesian nationalism. Njoto's coining of "Sukarnoism" represented cynical manipulation of national symbols for communist purposes. The military's action against the PKI, while involving regrettable violence, protected Indonesia's independence and non-aligned stance during the Cold War.[^78]
