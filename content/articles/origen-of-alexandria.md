## Summary

Origen was one of the most influential and controversial early Christian theologians. His Hexapla was the first critical edition of the Hebrew Bible and Greek translations. He developed allegorical methods of biblical interpretation and wrote extensively on theology, including De Principiis and Contra Celsum. His teachings were later both influential and condemned by church councils.
