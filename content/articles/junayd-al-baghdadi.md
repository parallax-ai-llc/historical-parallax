## Summary

Junayd al-Baghdadi was one of the most important early Sufi masters and is considered the founder of the 'sober' school of Sufism. He articulated the concept of fana (annihilation of the self in God) within a framework compatible with Islamic law. Most later Sufi orders trace their spiritual lineage through him. His careful integration of mystical experience with legal observance made Sufism more acceptable to mainstream Islam.
