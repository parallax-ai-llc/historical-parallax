## Summary

Nakae Toju was a Japanese Confucian philosopher who introduced Wang Yangming's (Yomeigaku) philosophy to Japan. Known as the 'Sage of Omi,' he emphasized innate moral knowledge and the unity of knowledge and action. He opened a school in Ogawa that attracted students from across Japan. His emphasis on sincerity, filial piety, and moral action over book learning influenced later samurai philosophy and the Meiji Restoration movement.
