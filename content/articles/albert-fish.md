## Summary
Albert Fish was an American serial killer, child rapist, and cannibal active in the early 20th century. Convicted of kidnapping and murdering 10-year-old Grace Budd, he confessed to additional murders and claimed to have molested over 100 children. He was executed by electric chair in 1936.

## Early Life
Born May 19, 1870, in Washington, D.C., Fish was placed in an orphanage after his father's death. He suffered severe abuse there, developing associations between pain and pleasure. He married in 1898, had six children, and his wife left him in 1917. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Fish committed crimes against children over decades, targeting African-American and disabled children from poor families. His most infamous crime was the 1928 kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd. He later sent a letter to her mother describing the crime in graphic detail. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Fish was caught through the letter's distinctive stationery traced to a flophouse. Arrested December 13, 1934, he confessed. Found sane and guilty in 1935, he was executed at Sing Sing Prison on January 16, 1936. [^3]
