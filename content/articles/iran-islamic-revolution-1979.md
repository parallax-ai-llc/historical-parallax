## Summary

On February 1, 1979, an Air France jet touched down in Tehran carrying the most dangerous cargo the Shah of Iran could imagine: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, returning from 14 years of exile. Millions lined the route from the airport. Ten days later, the 2,500-year-old Persian monarchy had collapsed. The Shah was gone. The Islamic Republic of Iran was born.[^1]

The Iranian Revolution remains one of the most consequential upheavals in modern history. It was a revolution nobody predicted—not the CIA, not the Shah's fearsome secret police SAVAK, not even Khomeini himself until late in the process. It brought together secular liberals, Marxists, bazaar merchants, and Islamists in an unlikely coalition against a modernizing autocrat armed with oil wealth and American support. And when it was over, the Islamists had outmaneuvered everyone else.[^2]

What emerged was something new: the world's first modern theocracy, a state governed by Islamic law under a Supreme Leader who claimed authority from God. The revolution transformed the Middle East, inspired Islamic movements from Lebanon to Afghanistan, took American diplomats hostage for 444 days, and made Iran a permanent adversary of the United States. Four decades later, the Islamic Republic still stands, and the debate over its meaning continues.[^3]
