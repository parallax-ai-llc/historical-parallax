## Summary

Jeong Seon (Gyeomjae) was a pioneering Korean painter who created the jingyeong sansuhwa (true-view landscape) genre, painting actual Korean landscapes rather than idealized Chinese scenes. His masterpiece Inwangjesaekdo (After Rain at Mount Inwang) is considered one of the greatest Korean paintings. He revolutionized Korean art by asserting the beauty of Korean scenery.
