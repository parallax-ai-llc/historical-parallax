## Summary

On March 18, 2014, hundreds of Taiwanese students did the unthinkable: they stormed and occupied their country's parliament. For 23 days, the Legislative Yuan became a protest camp as students blocked a trade agreement they feared would give China a chokehold on Taiwan's economy and democracy. The movement took its name from the sunflowers supporters brought to the occupiers—and it changed Taiwan forever.[^1]

The immediate target was the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (CSSTA), which the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) was trying to pass without proper review. But the deeper issue was Taiwan's relationship with China: how close was too close? The students—led by Lin Fei-fan and Chen Wei-ting—argued that economic integration would become political subordination. Half a million people rallied in support on March 30.[^2]

The Sunflower Movement succeeded: the trade agreement was shelved. But its impact went far beyond one bill. The movement awakened a generation, strengthened Taiwanese identity, and contributed to the KMT's defeat in 2016. Taiwan's political landscape shifted permanently—toward vigilance about China and pride in Taiwan's distinct democracy. The sunflower became a symbol of that choice.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Cross-Strait Relations

Taiwan's relationship with China is the island's defining issue:

- **1949:** KMT fled to Taiwan after losing civil war to Communists
- **Martial law:** 1949-1987
- **Democratization:** 1990s; first direct presidential election 1996
- **China's claim:** Considers Taiwan a province to be "reunified"
- **Status quo:** Ambiguous; neither independence nor unification[^4]

### Ma Ying-jeou's Presidency (2008-2016)

KMT's Ma Ying-jeou pursued closer ties with China:
- Economic agreements (ECFA, 2010)
- Direct flights and tourism
- Cross-strait rapprochement
- Critics warned of "selling out Taiwan"[^5]

### The CSSTA

**Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement (2013):**
- Signed June 2013
- Liberalized trade in 64 service sectors
- Concerns: Would allow Chinese investment in sensitive sectors
- Fear: Economic leverage → political pressure

**Legislative crisis (March 2014):**
- KMT attempted to pass without clause-by-clause review
- Used procedural maneuver to bypass scrutiny
- Opposition and civil society outraged[^6]

## The Occupation

### March 18: Storming the Legislature

**Evening, March 18:** Students and activists broke into the Legislative Yuan
- Occupied the main chamber
- Barricaded doors with chairs and ropes
- Livestreamed the occupation
- Declared: "Retreat the agreement; defend democracy"

The occupation would last **23 days**.[^7]

### Inside the Occupied Legislature

The occupation became a self-governing community:
- Organized security teams
- Media center; live broadcast
- Study sessions and lectures
- Art installations
- Donations of food and supplies flooded in
- Sunflowers became the movement's symbol[^8]

### March 23: Executive Yuan Attempt

**March 23:** Some protesters attempted to occupy the Executive Yuan (cabinet office)
- Police forcibly cleared them overnight
- Water cannons and batons used
- Injuries reported
- Controversial police response

The failed expansion focused movement back on Legislative Yuan.[^9]

### March 30: Mass Rally

**March 30:** Massive rally outside parliament
- Estimates: **116,000-500,000** participants
- One of Taiwan's largest protests ever
- Demanded rejection of CSSTA
- Showed breadth of support beyond students

### April 10: Exit

**April 6:** Legislative Speaker promised to pass oversight legislation before considering CSSTA

**April 10:** Students peacefully vacated the Legislative Yuan
- Victory declared
- No violence during exit
- Cleanup and departure orderly[^10]

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Democratic Defense:** The Sunflower Movement was a defense of Taiwan's democracy against procedural abuse and creeping Chinese influence. By occupying the legislature, students forced a national conversation about Taiwan's future. The movement proved that civil society could check government overreach.[^12]

**Identity Awakening:** Beyond the trade agreement, the movement strengthened Taiwanese identity. Surveys afterward showed increased identification as "Taiwanese" rather than "Chinese" or "both."

### KMT/Government Perspective

**Official Position:** The Ma administration argued that the CSSTA was necessary for Taiwan's economic competitiveness. Protesters were disrupting democratic process. The occupation was illegal and harmful to Taiwan's international credibility.

### Critical Analysis

**Generational Shift:** The Sunflower Movement marked the political awakening of a generation that grew up in democratic Taiwan and felt no nostalgia for KMT-era connections to China. This generation would dominate Taiwan's politics for decades.

**Regional Impact:** The movement inspired Hong Kong's 2014 Umbrella Revolution. Both movements shared concerns about China's influence and used occupation tactics.[^13]
