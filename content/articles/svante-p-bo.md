## Summary

Svante Pääbo is a Swedish geneticist who won the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning the genomes of extinct hominins and human evolution. He pioneered the field of paleogenomics by sequencing the Neanderthal genome and discovering the previously unknown hominin Denisova. His work revealed that ancient humans interbred with Neanderthals, contributing DNA to modern humans.
