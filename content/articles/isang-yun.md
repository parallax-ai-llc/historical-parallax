## Summary

Isang Yun was a Korean-born German composer who uniquely synthesized Korean traditional music with Western avant-garde techniques. His orchestral works and chamber music create a distinctive sound world of sliding tones and microtonal inflections drawn from Korean court music. He was kidnapped by the Korean CIA in 1967 and imprisoned before international pressure secured his release.
