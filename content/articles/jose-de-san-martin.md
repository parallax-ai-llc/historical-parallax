## Summary

José Francisco de San Martín y Matorras (1778-1850), known as "the Liberator of Argentina, Chile and Peru," was an Argentine general and the primary leader of South America's southern and central independence movements from Spanish colonial rule.[^1] Born in present-day Argentina but educated and trained militarily in Spain, he served in the Spanish army for over two decades before returning to South America in 1812 to lead revolutionary forces.[^2] His most renowned achievement was the audacious 1817 Crossing of the Andes—a military feat compared to Hannibal's and Napoleon's Alpine crossings—which enabled the liberation of Chile and ultimately Peru.[^3] San Martín's self-imposed exile following his mysterious meeting with Simón Bolívar at Guayaquil in 1822 cemented his legacy as a leader who prioritized the cause of independence over personal glory.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

José de San Martín was born on February 25, 1778, in Yapeyú, a former Jesuit mission station in Guaraní Indian territory in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, in what is now Corrientes Province, Argentina.[^5] His father, Juan de San Martín, was a Spanish professional soldier who served as lieutenant governor and administrator of the Yapeyú Department, while his mother, Gregoria Matorras del Ser, was also of Spanish descent.[^6] The family's position in colonial administration provided young José with exposure to both indigenous communities and Spanish military culture from an early age.

In 1781, when San Martín was only three or four years old, the family relocated to Buenos Aires, where his father requested a transfer to Spain.[^7] The family departed the Americas in 1783 and eventually settled in Madrid before moving to Málaga. This early departure from his birthplace meant that San Martín spent only his first few formative years in South America—a fact that would later generate historiographical controversy, as Argentine historian Bartolomé Mitre controversially claimed these early years shaped his personality more profoundly than the twenty-eight years he subsequently lived in Spain.[^8]

From 1785 to 1789, San Martín was educated at the prestigious Seminary of Nobles (Real Seminario de Nobles) in Madrid, an institution that prepared young men of aristocratic or military families for careers in service to the Spanish Crown.[^9] His education emphasized classical studies, mathematics, and military theory. However, he did not complete the full six-year elementary education program before enrolling in military service. On May 13, 1789, at the remarkably young age of eleven, San Martín enlisted as a cadet in the Murcia Infantry Regiment No. 12, beginning what would become a distinguished twenty-two-year career in the Spanish military.[^10]

San Martín's first taste of combat came at age fifteen when he participated in Spanish military operations in Morocco against local Muslim forces.[^11] This early baptism by fire in North Africa was followed by extensive service during the tumultuous period of the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic conflicts that engulfed Europe. His formative military experiences in the rigid hierarchical structure of the Spanish army, combined with exposure to Enlightenment ideas circulating in metropolitan Spain, would profoundly influence his later leadership style and political philosophy when he returned to liberate his homeland.[^12]

## Rise to Power

San Martín's path from Spanish military officer to South American revolutionary leader began during the Peninsular War (1808-1814), when Napoleon's forces invaded Spain.[^13] During this conflict, San Martín distinguished himself at the Battle of Bailén on July 19, 1808, where he commanded a dragoon squadron that charged French infantry positions. His performance in this engagement—which resulted in the remarkable surrender of 22,000 French troops to a smaller Spanish force—earned him promotion to lieutenant colonel and the prestigious Laureate Cross of Bailén.[^14] He continued to serve with distinction at the Battle of Albuera in 1811, after which he was elevated to command of the Sagunto Dragoons.[^15]

However, by 1811, San Martín's loyalties had begun to shift. While still serving in the Spanish army, he made contact with South American supporters of independence who had established themselves in London, forming connections with the broader network of creole revolutionaries seeking to overthrow Spanish colonial rule.[^16] The motivations for San Martín's decision to abandon his promising career in the Spanish military and join the independence movement remain a subject of historical debate. Some historians suggest he was motivated by patriotic longing for his native land, others propose he may have been recruited by British intelligence (which had strategic interests in weakening Spanish power in the Americas), while still others argue he was genuinely inspired by the liberal and revolutionary ideals emanating from both the American and French Revolutions.[^17]

In 1812, San Martín resigned his commission in the Spanish army and set sail for Buenos Aires aboard the British ship George Canning, arriving on March 9, 1812.[^18] He immediately offered his services to the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, the provisional government that had been established following the May Revolution of 1810. His European military training and combat experience made him an invaluable asset to the fledgling revolutionary forces. In September 1812, shortly after his arrival, he married María de los Remedios de Escalada, a fourteen-year-old girl from one of Buenos Aires's wealthy and politically influential families—a union that strengthened his social and political connections within Argentine revolutionary circles.[^19]

San Martín was quickly promoted to Colonel on December 7, 1812, and tasked with creating a cavalry regiment, the Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo).[^20] This unit would become instrumental in securing Argentine independence. On February 3, 1813, San Martín led his Grenadiers to victory at the Battle of San Lorenzo, his first military engagement on South American soil. Though a relatively small skirmish, this battle was strategically significant as it prevented Spanish forces from advancing up the Paraná River and demonstrated the effectiveness of San Martín's trained cavalry against royalist forces.[^21]

In 1814, San Martín was appointed to command the Army of the North (Ejército del Norte), which had been conducting a difficult and largely unsuccessful campaign against Spanish forces in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia).[^22] However, rather than continuing the grinding northern campaign, San Martín conceived a bold strategic alternative: he would build a new army in western Argentina, cross the Andes Mountains into Chile, liberate that country from Spanish rule, and then proceed by sea to attack Peru—the stronghold of Spanish viceregal power in South America. To implement this plan, he requested and received appointment as Governor-Intendant of the Province of Cuyo in 1814, a position that gave him the administrative authority and resources necessary to organize what would become the legendary Army of the Andes.[^23]

## Major Achievements

José de San Martín's greatest achievements center on three monumental military and political accomplishments: the liberation of Argentina, Chile, and Peru from Spanish colonial rule. These successes were the result not only of his military genius but also of his diplomatic skills, organizational abilities, and strategic vision that recognized the interconnected nature of South American independence struggles.[^24]

### The Army of the Andes and Argentine Independence

From his base in Mendoza, capital of Cuyo Province, San Martín devoted three years (1814-1817) to organizing, training, and equipping the Army of the Andes (Ejército de los Andes).[^25] This monumental effort required him to establish armories, hospitals, and supply depots while recruiting and training soldiers from across the region. The entire province was effectively converted into a war production economy, with workshops producing gunpowder, uniforms, weapons, and equipment. San Martín's meticulous planning extended to intelligence gathering, as he sent reconnaissance missions into Chile and employed a sophisticated misinformation campaign to confuse Spanish forces about his intended route of attack.[^26]

By the end of 1816, the Army of the Andes comprised approximately 5,000 men, supported by 10,000 mules and 1,500 horses, along with 22 artillery pieces.[^27] The force included Argentine soldiers, Chilean exiles who had fled after failed independence attempts in their homeland, and volunteers from across the region. San Martín's leadership during this period demonstrated his ability to inspire diverse groups to work toward a common goal, and his insistence on discipline, training, and preparation set his forces apart from the often ill-disciplined revolutionary armies elsewhere in Spanish America.

Meanwhile, San Martín's military and political efforts contributed significantly to the formal declaration of Argentine independence. On July 9, 1816, the Congress of Tucumán declared the independence of the United Provinces of South America from Spanish rule—an achievement made possible in no small measure by San Martín's military successes and his strategic vision for regional liberation.[^28]

### The Crossing of the Andes and Liberation of Chile

In January 1817, San Martín launched one of the most remarkable military operations in history: the Crossing of the Andes.[^29] The army departed from Mendoza and traversed the Andes Mountains via multiple routes, with the main force taking the Los Patos Pass and a secondary column under General Juan Gregorio de Las Heras using the Uspallata Pass. The crossing required navigating heights averaging 3,000 meters (nearly 10,000 feet), with some passes exceeding 4,000 meters, in the austral summer heat by day and freezing temperatures at night.[^30]

The successful 21-day crossing has been compared to Hannibal's crossing of the Alps in 218 BCE and Napoleon's 1800 Alpine crossing, and many historians consider San Martín's feat superior given the greater heights, harsher conditions, and the fact that he brought his army through largely intact and ready for immediate combat.[^31] On February 12, 1817, just days after descending from the mountains, San Martín's forces met Spanish royalist troops at the Battle of Chacabuco. The patriots achieved a decisive victory, and on February 13, San Martín and his Chilean ally Bernardo O'Higgins entered Santiago triumphantly.[^32]

Although offered the position of Supreme Director of Chile, San Martín declined, insisting that the Chilean patriot O'Higgins assume leadership—a decision that demonstrated his principle of national self-determination and his lack of personal ambition for political power.[^33] However, the liberation of Chile was not yet complete. Spanish forces regrouped and temporarily recaptured parts of the country. On April 5, 1818, San Martín achieved final victory at the Battle of Maipú, one of the most significant battles of the South American wars of independence, which secured Chilean independence definitively.[^34]

### The Peruvian Campaign and Protectorate

San Martín's ultimate strategic objective was Peru, the seat of Spanish viceregal power in South America and the source from which royalist forces threatened newly independent states.[^35] Recognizing that a land invasion across the desert and mountains of northern Chile and Peru would be extremely difficult, San Martín opted for a naval approach. With Chilean support, a fleet was assembled under the command of British Admiral Thomas Cochrane, and on August 20, 1820, the expedition departed from Valparaíso, Chile.[^36] The navy consisted of eight warships, eleven gunboats, 247 cannons, and a crew of 1,600 (most of them Chileans), transporting 4,000 soldiers of the Army of the Andes.[^37]

Rather than immediately attacking Lima, San Martín pursued a strategy of gradual pressure, establishing a base at Pisco and then Huacho, conducting diplomatic negotiations, and encouraging Peruvian defections from the royalist cause.[^38] This patient approach frustrated some of his subordinates, particularly Admiral Cochrane, but reflected San Martín's belief that Peruvian independence should be achieved with maximum Peruvian participation to ensure its legitimacy and durability.

By July 1821, the Spanish viceroy José de la Serna evacuated Lima, and San Martín entered the capital on July 12, 1821.[^39] On July 28, 1821, San Martín formally proclaimed Peruvian independence in a ceremony in Lima's main plaza, declaring: "From this moment on, Peru is free and independent by the general will of its people and by the justice of its cause that God defends. Long live the nation! Long live the freedom! Long live the independence!"[^40] He assumed the title of Protector of Peru (Protector del Perú) with supreme civil and military authority, declining the offer of a crown and instead establishing a republican framework.[^41]

As Protector, San Martín initiated important reforms including the abolition of Indigenous tribute, the prohibition of the slave trade, and the declaration that children born to enslaved people would be free.[^42] He also established the Peruvian National Library and attempted to create stable governmental institutions. However, significant Spanish forces remained in the Peruvian highlands, and San Martín lacked sufficient military strength to complete the liberation without assistance.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his monumental achievements, José de San Martín's career was not without significant controversies, failures, and criticisms that have been debated by historians for nearly two centuries.[^44]

### The Guayaquil Conference and Sudden Resignation

The most enduring mystery surrounding San Martín concerns his famous meeting with Simón Bolívar at Guayaquil, Ecuador, on July 26-27, 1822.[^45] The two great liberators of South America met to discuss the future of Peru and coordinate their efforts to expel remaining Spanish forces. However, the details of their private conversation have never been definitively established, as no reliable record exists of what was discussed behind closed doors.[^46]

What is known is that immediately following the conference, San Martín made the shocking decision to resign as Protector of Peru, relinquish command of his army, and effectively retire from public life.[^47] In September 1822, he announced his resignation to the Peruvian Congress and departed for Chile, leaving Bolívar to complete the liberation of Peru. Historians have proposed numerous explanations: that Bolívar refused to serve under San Martín's command or vice versa; that the two men disagreed fundamentally about the political future of Peru (with San Martín allegedly favoring constitutional monarchy while Bolívar supported republicanism); that San Martín recognized his inferior military position and stepped aside; or that he was simply exhausted and disillusioned with the political infighting that plagued the independence movements.[^48]

The conference clearly revealed a clash of personalities between the two men—Bolívar, charismatic and politically ambitious, distrusted San Martín's military abilities and was suspicious of his alleged monarchical leanings.[^49] Critics have argued that San Martín's withdrawal represented a failure of leadership at a critical moment, abandoning Peru before its liberation was complete. Defenders counter that his self-abnegation demonstrated his genuine commitment to the cause over personal glory and prevented a potentially destructive power struggle between the two liberators.[^50]

### Economic Failures and Administrative Difficulties in Peru

San Martín's tenure as Protector of Peru (1821-1822) has been criticized as administratively ineffective and economically disastrous.[^51] After occupying Lima, he faced enormous challenges: the Peruvian economy was disrupted by war, the treasury was empty, significant Spanish military forces remained in the interior highlands, and political divisions among Peruvians themselves hampered unified action.[^52]

According to historical research, Lima's bankruptcy became the chief reality that converted what should have been gradual confirmation of victory into a prolonged crisis of confidence resulting in eventual failure through inaction.[^53] San Martín struggled to raise funds to pay his army and maintain governmental functions. His reforms, while well-intentioned, often could not be effectively implemented due to lack of resources and administrative capacity. The stalemate with royalist forces in the highlands frustrated his officers and soldiers, leading to declining morale and discipline.[^54]

Additionally, conflicts with Admiral Cochrane over payment for the Chilean navy and strategic disagreements led to Cochrane's departure with much of the fleet, further weakening San Martín's position.[^55] Critics argue that San Martín demonstrated himself to be a far better military commander than political leader or administrator—a man whose talents lay in organizing and leading armies rather than governing nations.[^56]

### The Carrera Brothers Executions

One of the most controversial episodes associated with San Martín concerns the execution of Chilean revolutionary leaders Luis and Juan José Carrera, who were political rivals of Bernardo O'Higgins.[^57] The Carrera brothers were arrested in Mendoza in 1818 and subsequently executed. Chilean historian Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna directly implicated San Martín in these deaths, arguing that he bore responsibility for eliminating O'Higgins's political opponents.[^58] Other historians, including J.C. Raffo de la Reta, have argued that O'Higgins himself was primarily responsible, with San Martín playing at most a passive role.[^59]

This controversy has never been fully resolved, and it represents a dark stain on San Martín's reputation, particularly in Chile, where the Carrera family retained significant support. It raises questions about whether San Martín was willing to countenance political executions to maintain unity among independence forces or whether he was complicit in O'Higgins's consolidation of power through elimination of rivals.[^60]

### Historiographical Debates and Nationalistic Mythmaking

Modern scholarship has also criticized the way San Martín's legacy has been constructed and manipulated for nationalistic purposes, particularly in Argentina.[^61] The highly influential biography written by Argentine historian and president Bartolomé Mitre in the 1880s elevated San Martín to the status of Argentina's paramount national hero and "Liberator."[^62] However, later historians have identified numerous inaccuracies in Mitre's account, noting that he shaped the San Martín narrative to support his own political project of Argentine national unification and to subordinate other independence leaders, particularly Manuel Belgrano, to San Martín's predominance.[^63]

Critics have argued that Argentine nationalist historiography unfairly diminishes Belgrano's earlier and arguably more important contributions to independence in the northern campaigns, while exaggerating San Martín's role and downplaying the crucial support he received from Chilean forces and British naval power.[^64] Additionally, Mitre's controversial claim that San Martín's first six years in America shaped his personality more than his twenty-eight years in Spain has been challenged as historically untenable and designed to emphasize San Martín's "American" rather than "Spanish" identity.[^65]

### Political Relationships and Alleged Authoritarianism

San Martín's political relationships and his own political philosophy have also drawn criticism.[^66] He maintained good relations with Argentine federal caudillos (regional strongmen) like Juan Bautista Bustos, Estanislao López, and Facundo Quiroga, while developing a personal feud with the unitarian liberal leader Bernardino Rivadavia.[^67] This has led some historians to question whether San Martín harbored authoritarian or monarchical sympathies incompatible with liberal republican principles.

His establishment of the Order of the Sun in Peru and his assumption of the title "Protector" with supreme authority—even if temporary and ostensibly in service of establishing a republic—suggested to critics a comfort with concentrated executive power.[^68] Reports that he explored the possibility of establishing a constitutional monarchy in Peru with a European prince have fueled suspicions about his democratic commitments, though defenders argue he was simply being pragmatic about creating stable governance in the post-colonial context.[^69]

## Personal Life

José de San Martín's personal life was marked by long separations from family, chronic health problems, personal loss, and a character that combined severity with surprising warmth and humor—creating what historians have described as an enigmatic personality.[^70]

### Marriage and Family

On September 12, 1812, shortly after arriving in Buenos Aires, the thirty-four-year-old San Martín married María de los Remedios de Escalada, who was only fourteen years old at the time—a marriage arrangement typical of the era that allied San Martín with one of Buenos Aires's most prominent and wealthy patriot families.[^71] Despite the age difference and the arranged nature of the union, contemporary accounts suggest the couple developed genuine affection for one another, though San Martín's military campaigns meant they spent much of their marriage apart.[^72]

On August 24, 1816, while San Martín was in Mendoza organizing the Army of the Andes, Remedios gave birth to their only child, a daughter named Mercedes Tomasa de San Martín y Escalada.[^73] San Martín was a devoted father to Mercedes despite his frequent absences, and their correspondence reveals a tender relationship. However, tragedy struck the family when Remedios, who had joined San Martín in Peru, contracted tuberculosis. She returned to Buenos Aires for treatment but died on August 3, 1823, at the young age of twenty-five, while San Martín was in Europe.[^74]

Following his wife's death, San Martín assumed sole responsibility for raising Mercedes. In 1824, he moved permanently to Europe, settling first in Brussels, then in Paris, and finally in Grand-Bourg, near Paris, bringing his daughter with him.[^75] Mercedes eventually married Mariano Balcarce, a fellow Argentine exile and diplomat, and they had two daughters: María Mercedes and Josefa Dominga. San Martín lived with the Balcarce family during his final years, and his granddaughters provided companionship in his old age.[^76]

### Health Problems and Final Years

San Martín suffered from chronic health problems throughout much of his adult life, including severe rheumatism and digestive ailments, likely including ulcers or gastritis, which he may have developed during his arduous military campaigns.[^77] These conditions worsened as he aged, and he also experienced progressive vision loss, becoming nearly blind in his final years.[^78] Despite these physical afflictions, he maintained intellectual engagement with South American affairs, corresponding with contacts across the continent and following news from the newly independent nations he had helped create.[^79]

San Martín lived in voluntary exile in Europe for the last twenty-six years of his life (1824-1850), maintaining a modest lifestyle despite his military fame.[^80] He refused several invitations to return to Argentina, partly due to his disgust with the political factionalism and civil wars that plagued the region, and partly because of political conflicts with the government of Bernardino Rivadavia.[^81] He lived quietly in France, occupying himself with reading, correspondence, and time with his family.

On August 17, 1850, José de San Martín died in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, at the age of seventy-two, reportedly from complications of bronchitis and his chronic ailments.[^82] His death occurred in relative obscurity in Europe, far from the lands he had liberated. His remains were initially buried in France, but in 1880, they were repatriated to Argentina with great ceremony and entombed in a mausoleum in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral, where they remain today.[^83]

### Personality and Character

Historians describe San Martín's personality as complex and somewhat contradictory.[^84] He was known for severity and even coldness in his official demeanor—methodical, careful, organized, and persistent in his approach to military and administrative matters.[^85] He demanded strict discipline from his troops and was intolerant of disorder and inefficiency. This reputation for sternness was tempered, however, by accounts from those who knew him personally, who described his capacity for warmth, his sense of humor that helped him rise above personal slights and injuries, and his ability to judge the character and abilities of men, which enabled him to select capable subordinates and inspire loyalty.[^86]

Despite his military achievements, San Martín was notably modest and reluctant to seek glory or recognition.[^87] He was famously unwilling to pose for portraits, citing modesty and his frugal military lifestyle as reasons.[^88] His renunciation of political power in Chile (when offered leadership) and Peru (when he resigned as Protector) demonstrated an unusual lack of personal ambition in an era when many military leaders seized power for themselves. As one contemporary observer noted, "The thing that makes him truly great as a man is his unexampled unselfish renouncement of the glory, the power, that might have been his when the cause was won."[^89]

Yet San Martín's political views and ultimate goals remain somewhat enigmatic. His comfort with concentrated authority, his exploration of monarchical options for Peru, and his good relations with authoritarian caudillos suggest a man who valued order and stability over democratic participation.[^90] Simultaneously, his establishment of freedom for the children of slaves, abolition of Indigenous tribute, and creation of republican institutions in Peru demonstrate commitment to certain liberal principles.[^91] This combination of characteristics led historians to conclude that "the contradictions of his character leave him rather an enigma."[^92]

## Legacy

José de San Martín's legacy extends far beyond his military victories, encompassing his role as a founding father of three nations, his embodiment of values that continue to resonate in South American political culture, and his status as one of the most important figures in the history of Latin American independence.[^93]

### National Hero of Three Countries

San Martín is officially regarded as a national hero in Argentina, Chile, and Peru—a unique distinction that reflects the transnational scope of his liberation campaigns.[^94] In Argentina, he is venerated as the "Padre de la Patria" (Father of the Fatherland) and the "Libertador," and his birthday (February 25) is a national holiday.[^95] The Order of the Liberator General San Martín, created in his honor, is the highest decoration conferred by the Argentine government.[^96] Countless statues, monuments, streets, plazas, schools, and institutions bear his name throughout Argentina, and his image appears on currency and postage stamps.[^97]

In Chile, San Martín is honored as co-liberator alongside Bernardo O'Higgins, and monuments to him stand in prominent locations including Santiago's Plaza Bulnes.[^98] Chileans remember particularly his crossing of the Andes and his victory at Maipú, as well as his magnanimous refusal to assume political power in Chile. In Peru, he is commemorated as the Protector and the proclaimer of independence, with monuments in Lima and other cities, though his legacy there is somewhat complicated by the fact that Simón Bolívar completed the liberation San Martín began.[^99]

### Military and Strategic Legacy

From a military perspective, San Martín's Crossing of the Andes is widely regarded as one of the greatest military achievements in history.[^100] Military historians and strategists continue to study his campaign for its masterful combination of logistics, intelligence, deception, and bold execution under extreme conditions. The 207th anniversary commemoration noted it as "one of the greatest military feats in history," comparing it favorably to the most famous mountain crossings of classical and modern warfare.[^101]

Beyond this specific achievement, San Martín's strategic vision—recognizing that South American independence required coordinated action across the continent and that Peru's liberation was essential to securing the independence of the southern nations—demonstrated sophisticated geopolitical thinking.[^102] His establishment of the Army of the Andes as a professional, disciplined force set standards for military organization in the newly independent nations.[^103]

### Political and Moral Legacy

Perhaps San Martín's most enduring legacy is the moral example he set through his selfless renunciation of power.[^104] In an era when many revolutionary leaders (including some of his contemporaries) became dictators or monarchs, San Martín consistently declined positions of supreme authority when offered, insisted on civilian rule and republican institutions, and ultimately exiled himself rather than participate in factional conflicts.[^105] This example of civic virtue and subordination of personal ambition to the common good has become central to his mythological status in South American political culture.

His figure has been "immortalized in the collective memory of Argentina and the continent, not only for his military achievements, but also for the values he embodied: freedom, justice and unity."[^106] These values—particularly his commitment to South American unity and cooperation—have inspired later movements for regional integration, including the use of his name and image by organizations promoting Latin American solidarity.[^107]

### Educational and Cultural Impact

San Martín's legacy permeates educational curricula throughout Argentina, Chile, and Peru, where schoolchildren learn about his exploits as foundational national narratives.[^108] His maxims and principles, particularly those he wrote for his daughter Mercedes (emphasizing humanity, charity, love of country, and personal integrity), are taught as moral guidelines.[^109] The "Crossing of the Andes Tapestry," a monumental artwork created to commemorate the feat, serves as a visual tribute that keeps the memory alive for new generations.[^110]

### Contested and Evolving Legacy

While San Martín's heroic status remains largely unquestioned in popular culture, academic historians continue to debate and reassess his legacy.[^111] Recent scholarship has complicated the traditional narrative by examining the role of indigenous and enslaved peoples in his armies, questioning the extent to which independence movements served elite interests, and analyzing how San Martín's memory has been instrumentalized for nationalist purposes.[^112] The gap between the historical San Martín—a complex man with contradictions, failures, and ambiguities—and the mythologized national hero has become an area of productive historical inquiry.[^113]

Nevertheless, San Martín's essential achievements remain undeniable: he was instrumental in freeing millions of people from colonial rule, he demonstrated exceptional military genius, and he modeled a form of leadership that prioritized the cause over personal gain.[^114] More than 170 years after his death, his legacy continues to shape how South Americans understand their history, their national identities, and their aspirations for regional cooperation and dignity.[^115]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments of José de San Martín have predominantly emphasized his extraordinary military achievements, moral character, and selfless dedication to South American independence.[^116] Military historians consistently rank the Crossing of the Andes among the greatest logistical and tactical achievements in military history, praising San Martín's meticulous planning, deception strategies, and ability to maintain army cohesion under extreme conditions.[^117] As the Casa Rosada (Argentine presidential palace) noted in commemorating the feat: "207 years after one of the greatest military feats in history: The Tapestry of General San Martín, a tribute to the crossing of the Andes."[^118]

Beyond military prowess, admirers emphasize San Martín's political wisdom in recognizing the interconnected nature of South American independence struggles and developing a strategic vision that transcended narrow nationalism.[^119] His insistence on coordinating efforts across borders and his willingness to subordinate Argentine interests to the broader liberation cause demonstrated statesmanship rare among his contemporaries.[^120] The New World Encyclopedia summarizes this perspective: "San Martín is regarded as a national hero of Argentina, Chile, and Peru, a great military commander, and one of the Liberators of Spanish South America."[^121]

Historians sympathetic to San Martín particularly emphasize his moral character and selflessness.[^122] His repeated refusals of political power—declining leadership of Chile when offered, resigning as Protector of Peru, and choosing exile over participation in factional conflicts—stand in stark contrast to many revolutionary leaders who became dictators.[^123] As one assessment notes: "The thing that makes him truly great as a man is his unexampled unselfish renouncement of the glory, the power, that might have been his when the cause was won."[^124] This self-abnegation has become central to his heroic image, presenting him as a leader motivated purely by principle rather than personal ambition.[^125]

Defenders also praise his progressive social policies, including his abolition of Indigenous tribute, prohibition of the slave trade in Peru, and declaration that children born to enslaved people would be free.[^126] While these reforms were incomplete and imperfectly implemented, they demonstrated San Martín's commitment to extending the principles of liberty and equality beyond merely replacing Spanish rule with creole governance.[^127] His establishment of educational and cultural institutions, including the Peruvian National Library, further evidences his vision for building new nations on enlightened principles.[^128]

The Argentine government's official commemorations consistently present San Martín as embodying timeless values: "His figure has been immortalized in the collective memory of Argentina and the continent, not only for his military achievements, but also for the values he embodied: freedom, justice and unity."[^129] This view emphasizes San Martín as a moral exemplar whose legacy transcends his specific historical context to provide continuing inspiration for contemporary South Americans.[^130]

### Negative Views

Critical scholarly assessments of San Martín, while acknowledging his military achievements, have raised significant questions about his political judgment, administrative abilities, and the limitations of his vision for post-colonial society.[^131] Historians examining his tenure as Protector of Peru have been particularly critical, with research demonstrating that "reality converted what should have been the gradual confirmation of a victory into a prolonged crisis of confidence resulting in eventual failure through inaction, with Lima's bankruptcy being the chief reality."[^132] These scholars argue that San Martín lacked the political skills and administrative capacity necessary to govern effectively, and that his strategic caution in Peru bordered on paralysis.[^133]

The controversy surrounding his mysterious resignation following the Guayaquil Conference with Simón Bolívar has generated substantial criticism.[^134] Detractors argue that his sudden departure from Peru represented a failure of leadership at the crucial moment when his presence was most needed to complete the liberation struggle.[^135] Some historians suggest that San Martín's withdrawal revealed his recognition of his own inadequacy compared to Bolívar's superior political and military capabilities, while others view it as an abandonment of responsibility that left Peru in a precarious situation.[^136] The contrast between the two liberators has not always favored San Martín: "The conference clearly indicated the clash of personalities between the two men, as Bolívar distrusted both San Martín's military ability and his monarchical leanings."[^137]

Questions about San Martín's political philosophy have also generated criticism.[^138] His exploration of constitutional monarchy as a governmental form for Peru, his comfortable relationships with authoritarian caudillos, and his apparent discomfort with democratic participation have led some scholars to question whether he genuinely embraced liberal republican principles or simply accepted them as pragmatically necessary.[^139] Critics argue that his preference for order and hierarchy reflected his European military training and Spanish aristocratic background more than commitment to the egalitarian ideals of the independence movements.[^140]

The controversy surrounding the execution of the Carrera brothers remains a significant stain on San Martín's reputation, with Chilean historian Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna directly implicating him in these political killings.[^141] Whether San Martín was actively responsible or merely complicit through inaction, the incident raises troubling questions about his willingness to countenance political violence against rivals.[^142]

Modern critical scholarship has also examined how San Martín's legacy has been constructed and manipulated for nationalist purposes.[^143] Historians have identified numerous inaccuracies in Bartolomé Mitre's influential biography, noting that Mitre shaped the San Martín narrative to support his own political agenda of Argentine national consolidation.[^144] As a result, "Argentine nationalist historiography elevates San Martín above Manuel Belgrano, yet critics argue this overlooks Belgrano's earlier northern contributions and San Martín's reliance on Chilean and British support."[^145] This revisionist scholarship argues that the "San Martín myth" has obscured the collaborative and transnational nature of independence struggles, giving excessive credit to a single individual while minimizing the contributions of others.[^146]

Finally, some scholars note that assessments of San Martín's character reveal fundamental contradictions: "Most historians agree that he was a far better military commander than leader of a country, and he was not charismatic and not seen as a hero like Bolivar until years after his death."[^147] This observation suggests that San Martín's elevation to supreme national hero status was more a product of posthumous mythmaking than contemporary recognition, and that his actual historical impact may have been more limited than the traditional heroic narrative suggests.[^148]
