## Summary

Cheoljong (born July 25, 1831; died January 16, 1864) was the 25th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1849 to 1864.[^1] He is famously known as the **"Woodcutter Prince"** (Ganghwa Doryeong) because he lived as an illiterate peasant in exile on Ganghwa Island before being suddenly thrust onto the throne at age 19. His reign is the epitome of **Sedo Politics** (in-law government), where the powerful **Andong Kim clan** manipulated the uneducated king as a puppet to maintain their grip on power.[^2] His death without an heir marked the end of the direct bloodline of kings descending from King Hyojong, plunging the dynasty into a succession crisis that would eventually lead to the rise of the Heungseon Daewongun.[^3]

## Early Life: The Woodcutter of Ganghwa

Born **Yi Won-beom**, Cheoljong was a great-grandnephew of King Yeongjo. However, his family had fallen into disgrace.

- **Exile:** His grandfather was accused of treason and executed in 1779. In 1844, his older brother was also executed for involvement in a plot, and the entire family was exiled to **Ganghwa Island**.
- **Peasant Life:** For years, Yi Won-beom lived in abject poverty, cutting wood and farming to survive. He received no formal royal education and was essentially illiterate when he was found.[^4]

## Unexpected Accession

When King Heonjong died heirless in 1849, the powerful **Queen Sunwon** (of the Andong Kim clan) needed a successor who had no political backing and could be easily controlled. She chose the 19-year-old woodcutter from Ganghwa.

- **The Puppet King:** Upon arrival in Seoul, he was adopted as the son of King Sunjo and enthroned as King Cheoljong. He was immediately married to **Queen Cheorin**, a member of the Andong Kim clan, further tightening their control.[^5]

## Reign of the Andong Kims (Sedo Politics)

Cheoljong's 14-year reign was characterized by the absolute dominance of the Andong Kim clan.

- **Corruption:** With a powerless king, the clan members sold government positions and embezzled taxes. The "Three Administrations" (land tax, military service tax, and state granary system) became hopelessly corrupt, burdening the peasantry.[^6]
- **Peasant Uprisings:** The exploitation led to the **Imsul Peasant Revolts of 1862**, a massive wave of uprisings that swept establishing the southern provinces (Jinju, Jeju, etc.). Cheoljong attempted to address grievances by establishing a reform office (Samjeong Ijeongcheong), but the entrenched bureaucracy blocked any meaningful change.[^7]

## Death and Legacy

Cheoljong died on **January 16, 1864**, at the age of 32. He famously stated, "I want to have a cup of makkolli (rice wine)," longing for his simple days on Ganghwa Island.

- **Heirless Death:** Despite having five sons and six daughters, only one daughter survived infancy. He died without a male heir.[^8]
- **Succession:** His death created a power vacuum. The dowager Queen Sinjeong (of the rival Pungyang Jo clan) seized the royal seal and selected the 12-year-old Yi Myeong-bok (Gojong) as the next king, allowing his father, the Heungseon Daewongun, to take power and end the era of Andong Kim dominance.[^9]
