## Summary

James Lind conducted one of the first controlled clinical trials in 1747, demonstrating that citrus fruits could prevent and cure scurvy. His experiment aboard HMS Salisbury compared six different treatments for scurvy patients, establishing evidence-based medicine. His work eventually led to the British Navy mandating lemon juice for sailors.
