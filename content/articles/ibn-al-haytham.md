## Summary

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) was an Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who is regarded as the father of modern optics. His 'Book of Optics' correctly described the nature of light and vision, overturning the emission theory of Euclid and Ptolemy. He pioneered the scientific method through his emphasis on experimentation and mathematical proof. His work influenced Roger Bacon, Kepler, and Descartes.
