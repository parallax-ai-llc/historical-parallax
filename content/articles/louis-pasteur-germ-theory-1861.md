## Overview

Louis Pasteur (1822–1895) is one of the three founders of bacteriology (along with Koch and Lister) and arguably saved more lives than any other scientist in history. A French chemist, he proved that disease and spoilage are caused by microscopic living organisms (germs), not by "bad air" (miasma) or spontaneous generation. He invented **Pasteurization** (heating food to kill microbes) and developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax, fundamentally changing medicine from guesswork to science.

## Killing Spontaneous Generation (1861)

**The Old Belief:** Mold and maggots appear spontaneously in rotting matter.
**The Swan-Neck Flask Experiment:**
Pasteur boiled broth in a flask with a long, curved neck. Air could get in, but dust/microbes got trapped in the curve.
The broth remained clear for months.
When he broke the neck, microbes appeared immediately.
**Conclusion:** *"Omne vivum ex vivo"* (Life comes only from life).

## Saving Industries

**Wine & Beer:**
French vats were spoiling. Pasteur showed it was bacteria producing lactic acid instead of yeast producing alcohol. He taught them to heat the wine to 55°C. **Pasteurization** was born.
**Silk:**
A silkworm epidemic was destroying the French silk industry. Pasteur spent 5 years identifying the parasite and teaching farmers how to separate healthy eggs.

## The Rabies Vaccine (1885)

Rabies was a death sentence—100% fatal and terrifying.
Pasteur couldn't see the virus (too small for microscopes), but he could weaken it.
He dried the spinal cords of infected rabbits for days to attenuate (weaken) the virus.
**Joseph Meister:**
A 9-year-old boy was mauled by a rabid dog. He faced certain death.
Pasteur took a massive ethical risk (he was not a licensed physician) to test his vaccine on the boy.
He gave 13 injections over 11 days, each stronger than the last.
The boy survived.
**Legacy:** The Pasteur Institute was founded. Joseph Meister later worked there as a caretaker (and committed suicide rather than open Pasteur's crypt to the Nazis in 1940).
