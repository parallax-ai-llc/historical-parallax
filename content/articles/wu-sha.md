## Summary

Wu Sha (吳沙, 1731-1799) was a Han Chinese pioneer who led the first successful permanent settlement of the Kavalan region (modern-day Yilan County) in northeastern Taiwan during the late Qing dynasty. Born in Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, Wu Sha migrated to Taiwan in 1773 and spent decades establishing relationships with indigenous peoples through trade and traditional medicine. In 1796, he led approximately one thousand settlers from Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Hakka communities to establish permanent settlements in what is now Yilan, despite initial resistance from the indigenous Kavalan people. Known as "the first person to open Yilan" (開蘭第一人), Wu Sha's legacy remains deeply controversial—celebrated by some as a pioneering developer who opened northeastern Taiwan to Han Chinese civilization, yet criticized by others as a colonizer whose actions led to the displacement and dispossession of indigenous Kavalan peoples from their ancestral lands.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Wu Sha was born on September 14, 1731, in Zhangpu County, Zhangzhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, during the Qing dynasty reign of the Qianlong Emperor.[^4] Little is known about his early childhood and family circumstances, though historical records indicate that economic hardship plagued his family in Fujian. The coastal regions of Zhangzhou and neighboring Quanzhou were experiencing significant population pressure and land scarcity during the early to mid-18th century, prompting many residents to seek opportunities across the Taiwan Strait despite Qing government prohibitions on migration to Taiwan.[^5]

In 1773, at the age of 42, Wu Sha made the momentous decision to migrate to Taiwan with his wife and children, initially working as a hired laborer to establish himself in this frontier territory.[^6] The crossing of the Taiwan Strait was dangerous and illegal during this period, as the Qing government maintained strict controls on migration to prevent unrest and complications with indigenous populations. Nevertheless, economic desperation drove thousands of Fujian and Guangdong residents to risk the journey.[^7]

After arriving in Taiwan, Wu Sha eventually moved to Sanliao Society (三貂社), located in what is today the Aodi and Fulong area of Gongliao District in New Taipei City, in the northeastern corner of Taiwan.[^8] This relocation proved to be a turning point in Wu Sha's fortunes. In Sanliao, he began cultivating land and, crucially, developed relationships with the local indigenous Sanliao people. Wu Sha possessed skills in traditional Chinese medicine and demonstrated an aptitude for learning indigenous languages, which enabled him to gain the trust of the Sanliao indigenous community—a relationship that would prove instrumental in his later colonization efforts.[^9]

Beyond farming, Wu Sha engaged in "fanqie" (番契) or aboriginal trade, exchanging miscellaneous goods with indigenous peoples throughout the northeastern Taiwan region.[^10] This commercial activity not only provided economic returns but also allowed Wu Sha to build extensive networks with various indigenous communities, knowledge of the terrain, and understanding of indigenous customs—all of which would later facilitate his settlement of the Kavalan plain. To attract more Han Chinese settlers to the Sanliao area, Wu Sha reportedly provided each newcomer with one axe and one dou (斗, approximately 10 liters) of rice as a foundation for pioneering, enabling them to clear forests and open farmland.[^11]

## Rise to Power

Wu Sha's rise from a struggling laborer to a recognized colonial leader occurred through a combination of strategic relationship-building, political opportunism, and participation in Qing military campaigns. In 1787, the massive Lin Shuangwen Rebellion erupted in Taiwan, threatening Qing control of the island.[^12] The rebellion, led by Lin Shuangwen, a member of the Heaven and Earth Society (Tiandihui), quickly mobilized approximately 50,000 insurgents and occupied most of southern Taiwan.[^13] The rebellion sparked large-scale ethnic conflicts between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou communities, as Lin's forces consisted primarily of Zhangzhou people, triggering violent feuds with Quanzhou settlers.[^14]

In 1788, Wu Sha assisted Qing government forces in suppressing the Lin Shuangwen Rebellion, providing crucial local knowledge and support.[^15] For his loyalty and service, Wu Sha received official recognition and was awarded the title "Wu Xin Lang" (武信郎), a minor military honor that granted him social prestige and connections with Qing officials.[^16] This recognition proved invaluable in Wu Sha's subsequent colonization efforts, as it provided him with credibility and access to sympathetic officials who would later support his technically illegal settlement activities.

Following his military service, Wu Sha began actively planning the colonization of Gamalan (噶瑪蘭), the indigenous name for the Kavalan plain in northeastern Taiwan. In 1787, Wu Sha made his first attempt to colonize Gamalan but was defeated by indigenous resistance.[^17] Despite this initial failure, Wu Sha persisted in his ambitions. The following year in 1788, he managed to convince Taiwan Prefect Yang Tingli (楊廷理) to support his colonization plans.[^18] Yang recommended subjugating the natives and opening Gamalan for Han settlement to the Fujian governor, but the governor refused to act due to fear of conflict with indigenous peoples and concerns about violating Qing aboriginal boundary policies.[^19]

Undeterred by official rejection at the provincial level, Wu Sha continued cultivating relationships with local officials. In 1797, a new Tamsui sub-prefect issued Wu Sha a permit and provided financial support for recruiting settlers for land reclamation—despite such colonization being explicitly illegal under Qing law at the time.[^20] This official support, though unauthorized by higher authorities, gave Wu Sha the backing he needed to launch his most ambitious colonization attempt. The Qing government's aboriginal boundary policies theoretically prohibited Han settlement in indigenous territories, but local officials often ignored or undermined these restrictions when they believed colonization could extend imperial control or generate tax revenue.[^21]

## Major Achievements

Wu Sha's most significant achievement was leading the first successful permanent Han Chinese settlement of the Kavalan plain in 1796-1797, establishing the foundation for what would become Yilan County.[^22] In 1796, the first year of the Jiaqing Emperor's reign, Wu Sha assembled approximately one thousand immigrants from diverse origins—Zhangzhou people (漳州人), Quanzhou people (泉州人), and Hakka people (客家人) from Guangdong Province.[^23] This multi-ethnic coalition was remarkable given the intense ethnic feuding that characterized Han settlement in other parts of Taiwan during this period, particularly the violent Zhangzhou-Quanzhou conflicts.[^24]

Wu Sha's initial landing at Wushi Harbor met with fierce resistance from the indigenous Kavalan people, who recognized the existential threat posed by Han colonization.[^25] The Kavalan people, who had inhabited the Lanyang Plain for centuries and had started paying taxes to Qing authorities as early as the Kangxi period (1661-1722) while maintaining their distinct culture and autonomy, fought desperately to repel the invaders.[^26] According to historical accounts, the conflicts resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, and Wu Sha was forced to retreat to Sanliao Cape.[^27]

However, in 1797, a smallpox epidemic devastated the Kavalan indigenous communities, causing numerous deaths and severely weakening their capacity to resist Han encroachment.[^28] Wu Sha, drawing on his knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine, took the initiative to provide medical treatment to afflicted Kavalan people.[^29] Whether motivated by genuine humanitarian concern or calculated strategy to gain indigenous trust, this medical intervention proved pivotal. The epidemic-weakened Kavalan communities, grateful for Wu Sha's medical assistance, became less able and willing to resist Han settlement. Wu Sha successfully led his followers into the Toucheng (頭城) area, establishing the first permanent Han settlement in the region, which became known as Touwei.[^30]

Following the establishment of Toucheng, Han Chinese immigration to the Kavalan plain accelerated rapidly. Eventually, thousands more Han settlers entered the area, fundamentally transforming the demographics, economy, and culture of northeastern Taiwan.[^31] Wu Sha's settlement included people from different dialect groups and regions—when he first led settlers to the Yilan plain, Guangdong people, Quanzhou people, and Zhangzhou people were all included, representing an unusual example of inter-ethnic cooperation during Taiwan's settlement period.[^32] The Yilan plain today contains 37 Hakka temples dedicated to the worship of the Three Mountain Kings, more than anywhere else in Taiwan, testimony to the significant Hakka presence in Wu Sha's original settlement coalition.[^33]

Despite establishing a thriving settlement, Wu Sha and his successors faced ongoing legal complications. Because Qing law had not authorized the colonization of Gamalan, Wu Sha's successors were unable to register their reclaimed land on official government registers, and local officials, though supportive of land reclamation, could not officially recognize these holdings.[^34] This ambiguous legal status persisted until formal Qing incorporation of the region. Taiwan Prefect Yang Tingli continued advocating for formal administration of Gamalan, eventually recommending to Fuzhou General Saichong'a (賽沖阿) the establishment of formal administration and land surveys in Gamalan.[^35] Saichong'a initially refused but later changed his mind, sending a memorial to the emperor in 1808 recommending incorporation. In 1809, the emperor ordered Gamalan's incorporation, and in 1810, an imperial decree formally incorporated Gamalan into Qing administration with the appointment of a Gamalan sub-prefect.[^36]

Wu Sha died on January 14, 1799, at the age of 67, just three years after establishing his settlement and over a decade before the formal Qing recognition of the territory he pioneered.[^37] His death occurred before he could witness the full fruits of his colonization efforts, but his descendants and followers continued developing the region. Wu Sha's legacy as "the first person to open Yilan" became firmly established in Han Taiwanese historiography, and he was eventually deified as the founding father of Yilan.[^38] The Wu Sha Residence in Yilan serves as a historical site commemorating his role in pioneering the region, attracting tourists and serving as a tangible reminder of his impact on Taiwanese history.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While traditional Han Chinese historiography has celebrated Wu Sha as a pioneering hero who brought civilization and development to northeastern Taiwan, modern scholars and indigenous advocates have increasingly challenged this narrative, recognizing Wu Sha's colonization as a process of indigenous dispossession and cultural destruction. The most fundamental criticism concerns Wu Sha's role in the displacement of the Kavalan people from their ancestral homeland. In 1796, when Wu Sha led thousands of immigrants from Fujian Province to settle the area, it triggered an exodus of the Kavalan people who had inhabited the Lanyang Plain for centuries.[^40]

The initial conflicts between Wu Sha's settlers and the Kavalan people were violent and bloody. Historical records describe "fierce resistance" from indigenous peoples who recognized the existential threat posed by Han colonization, resulting in "heavy casualties" and "frequent fighting."[^41] The Kavalan people fought desperately to defend their territory, but they faced overwhelming demographic and technological disadvantages. The smallpox epidemic of 1797, which facilitated Wu Sha's successful entry into Toucheng, has been interpreted by some scholars as a case of disease-aided conquest, whether or not Wu Sha deliberately exploited indigenous vulnerability to epidemic diseases.[^42]

The long-term consequences of Wu Sha's colonization were catastrophic for the Kavalan people. As more Han Chinese settlers poured into the region following Wu Sha's initial settlement, the Kavalan people's way of life was fundamentally disrupted. Eventually, many more Han Chinese entered the area and "the life of Kavalan was forced to change."[^43] Because of cultural clashes and bloody territorial conflicts, most of the Kavalan tribe relocated to Hsincheng and Fengpin villages in Hualien County as well as Chungpin village in Taitung County.[^44] The Kavalan began this forced migration roughly between 1803 and 1840 as Han Chinese occupied their land, abandoning their ancestral territory in what is now Yilan County.[^45]

The displacement continued for generations. In 1878, nearly eight decades after Wu Sha's death, Kavalan, Sakizaya, and their allies fought a devastating battle against Qing invaders in an event called "the Incident Takobowan," which ended disastrously for both indigenous communities with many killed.[^46] By the time of formal Qing incorporation of the Gamalan plain in 1810, the indigenous people's subordination was complete—the government "passively included Lanyang Plain into its territory," effectively ratifying the fait accompli created by Wu Sha's illegal colonization.[^47]

Another significant controversy concerns the illegal nature of Wu Sha's colonization activities. Qing law explicitly prohibited unauthorized settlement in indigenous territories to prevent conflicts and maintain the aboriginal boundary (番界).[^48] Wu Sha's 1797 settlement was undertaken with the support of the Tamsui sub-prefect who issued permits and financial support "which was illegal."[^49] While Taiwan Prefect Yang Tingli supported Wu Sha's efforts to claim land held by the Kavalan people and recommended colonization to the Fujian governor, higher authorities initially refused due to concerns about violating policy and provoking conflict.[^50] Wu Sha and his local official supporters thus circumvented established law and policy, prioritizing Han expansion over indigenous rights and governmental restrictions.

The ambiguous legal status of Wu Sha's settlement created long-term complications. His successors were unable to register their reclaimed land on government registers, and local officials, though supportive, could not officially recognize it.[^51] This legal limbo persisted until 1810, creating uncertainty about property rights and governance. Critics argue that this pattern—illegal settlement followed by eventual government recognition—established a precedent for Han colonization that undermined indigenous land rights throughout Taiwan's history.

Contemporary indigenous rights advocates view Wu Sha not as a heroic pioneer but as a colonizer whose actions initiated the systematic dispossession of Kavalan people. The traditional narrative of "opening" (開) Yilan frames the region as empty wilderness awaiting development, erasing the indigenous presence and perspective. In reality, the Kavalan people had developed sophisticated agricultural systems, social structures, and cultural practices on the Lanyang Plain long before Wu Sha's arrival. The question posed by some scholars—"Was Wu Sha a pioneer in developing the Lanyang Plain, or an invader who occupied indigenous land?"—reflects the contested nature of his legacy.[^52]

## Personal Life

Historical records provide limited information about Wu Sha's personal and family life, as was typical for figures of his social standing in Qing dynasty Taiwan. Wu Sha married and had children before migrating from Fujian to Taiwan in 1773, bringing his wife and family with him on the dangerous journey across the Taiwan Strait.[^53] This decision to bring his entire family rather than migrating alone suggests Wu Sha intended permanent settlement in Taiwan from the outset, rather than temporary sojourning to earn money before returning to his ancestral home—a common pattern among many Chinese migrants to Southeast Asia and Taiwan during this period.

The journey to Taiwan with his family demonstrates both Wu Sha's determination and the desperate economic circumstances that drove his migration. Crossing the Taiwan Strait illegally with women and children was considerably more dangerous and complicated than solo male migration, yet Wu Sha deemed the risks worthwhile compared to the poverty he faced in Zhangpu County. Upon arrival, Wu Sha's family initially lived in difficult circumstances as he worked as a hired laborer, suggesting they may have experienced downward mobility from their status in Fujian or continued the poverty that prompted their migration.[^54]

Wu Sha's personality appears to have combined several key traits that contributed to his success as a frontier settler and colonizer. Historical accounts describe him as skilled in medicine and someone who "loved socializing with people" (善交際).[^55] This sociability was not merely a personal characteristic but a strategic advantage—Wu Sha actively cultivated relationships across ethnic and cultural boundaries, learning indigenous languages and building trust with Sanliao indigenous communities. His medical knowledge, rooted in traditional Chinese medicine, served both humanitarian and political purposes, earning him gratitude and influence among indigenous peoples, particularly during the 1797 smallpox epidemic.[^56]

Wu Sha demonstrated considerable patience and persistence in pursuing his colonization objectives. After his initial failed attempt to settle Gamalan in 1787, he did not abandon his ambitions but instead spent nearly a decade building political support, cultivating relationships with officials, and preparing for another attempt.[^57] This long-term strategic thinking distinguished Wu Sha from opportunistic frontier adventurers who sought quick profits.

His ability to unite settlers from different ethnic backgrounds—Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Hakka communities that frequently feuded violently elsewhere in Taiwan—suggests Wu Sha possessed significant leadership and diplomatic skills.[^58] Whether through force of personality, strategic marriage alliances, economic incentives, or shared interests in colonizing new territory, Wu Sha managed to create a relatively cohesive multi-ethnic settlement coalition, an achievement that was uncommon during this period of intense ethnic conflict in Taiwan.

Wu Sha's religious and cultural identity likely conformed to the syncretic folk religion common among Fujian migrants to Taiwan, combining elements of Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, and local deity worship. After his death, Wu Sha himself became an object of religious veneration, deified as the founding father of Yilan, suggesting his descendants and later settlers attributed to him supernatural power and protective functions.[^59] This apotheosis reflects both traditional Chinese practices of ancestor worship and the tendency to deify founding figures who established new communities.

Wu Sha died on January 14, 1799, at the age of 67, and was buried in Yilan.[^60] His tomb became a historical site, marking the resting place of the man credited with opening northeastern Taiwan to Han settlement. The Wu Sha Residence, constructed by his descendants or followers, stands as a memorial to his pioneering role, serving as both a tourist attraction and a site of historical contestation between those who celebrate and those who critique his legacy.[^61]

## Legacy

Wu Sha's legacy is deeply contested, reflecting broader debates about colonialism, indigenous rights, and historical memory in Taiwan. In traditional Han Chinese historiography, Wu Sha occupies a position of honor as "the first person to open Yilan" (開蘭第一人), a pioneer who brought civilization, development, and Chinese culture to a wilderness frontier.[^62] This narrative has been institutionalized through monuments, historical sites, textbooks, and local traditions that celebrate Wu Sha's courage, determination, and achievement in establishing the first permanent Han settlement in northeastern Taiwan.

The Wu Sha Residence in Toucheng, Yilan County, serves as the primary physical embodiment of this commemorative tradition.[^63] Designated as a historical site and tourist attraction, the residence receives government support and promotes an understanding of Wu Sha as a heroic founding father. Local tourism materials describe Wu Sha as "famous for pioneering the development of the Yilan area," framing his activities in terms of progress and development rather than colonization and displacement.[^64] For many Han Taiwanese, particularly those in Yilan County who trace their ancestry to Wu Sha's original settlement coalition, Wu Sha represents a founding ancestor whose pioneering spirit opened opportunities for their families.

Wu Sha's deification as a protective deity demonstrates the depth of his integration into local religious culture.[^65] In traditional Chinese religion, successful settlers and community founders were often elevated to divine or semi-divine status, worshipped for their protective power and continued influence over the communities they established. Wu Sha's transformation from historical figure to religious object reflects his enduring significance in Han Taiwanese collective memory and identity formation.

However, from the perspective of Taiwan's indigenous peoples, particularly the Kavalan, Wu Sha's legacy is fundamentally different—he represents the beginning of systematic dispossession, forced migration, and cultural destruction. The "opening" of Yilan was simultaneously the closing of Kavalan autonomy and territorial control. The year 1796 marks not a moment of heroic pioneering but rather the start of an exodus that would eventually drive most Kavalan people from their ancestral homeland to marginal areas in Hualien and Taitung counties.[^66]

Contemporary indigenous rights movements have challenged the celebratory narrative surrounding Wu Sha and similar colonial figures. Scholarly work asking whether Wu Sha was "a pioneer in developing the Lanyang Plain, or an invader who occupied indigenous land" represents this critical reevaluation.[^67] For indigenous activists and scholars, the traditional historiography erases indigenous presence and perspectives, treating the Lanyang Plain as empty wilderness rather than as the Kavalan people's homeland with established communities, agricultural systems, and cultural landscapes.

The political significance of Wu Sha's legacy extends to contemporary debates about indigenous land rights, historical justice, and national identity in Taiwan. Taiwan's indigenous peoples, who constitute approximately 2.4% of the island's population, have increasingly demanded recognition of historical injustices, land rights, and cultural preservation. In this context, figures like Wu Sha symbolize the colonial processes that dispossessed indigenous peoples—not only during the Qing dynasty but continuing through Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945) and the Republic of China period (1945-present).

The formal recognition of the Kavalan people as one of Taiwan's officially recognized indigenous groups in 2002 represented a significant milestone in indigenous rights advocacy.[^68] This recognition came after decades of displacement and cultural suppression, and it has enabled renewed attention to Kavalan history and the historical processes that led to their marginalization. In this context, Wu Sha's activities are increasingly understood as colonial conquest rather than pioneering development.

Wu Sha's role in successfully uniting Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Hakka settlers represents another aspect of his legacy—the demonstration that multi-ethnic Han cooperation was possible even during periods of intense ethnic conflict.[^69] The Yilan region's 37 Hakka temples dedicated to the Three Mountain Kings, more than anywhere else in Taiwan, testify to the enduring Hakka presence established during Wu Sha's settlement.[^70] This multi-ethnic character distinguished Yilan from regions where single dialect groups dominated and suggests that frontier conditions could sometimes overcome ethnic divisions that proved intractable elsewhere.

The legal precedent established by Wu Sha's colonization—illegal settlement followed by eventual government recognition—had lasting implications for Taiwan's development. The pattern whereby local officials supported unauthorized colonization despite central government prohibitions, creating facts on the ground that higher authorities eventually ratified, repeated throughout Taiwan's history. This undermined both indigenous territorial rights and centralized governmental control over frontier development.

In contemporary Taiwan, Wu Sha's legacy remains subject to ongoing reinterpretation as the island grapples with questions of historical memory, indigenous justice, and national identity. The tension between celebrating pioneer settlers and acknowledging indigenous dispossession reflects broader debates about how to narrate Taiwan's complex history of migration, colonization, and state formation. Wu Sha—simultaneously pioneer and colonizer, medical practitioner and land grabber, community founder and indigenous dispossessor—embodies these contradictions and contested memories.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Traditional Han Chinese historiography and many contemporary local historians in Yilan County celebrate Wu Sha as an exemplary pioneer whose vision, courage, and determination opened northeastern Taiwan to development and civilization. According to this perspective, Wu Sha demonstrated remarkable entrepreneurial spirit in recognizing the agricultural potential of the Kavalan plain and organizing the resources necessary to establish a permanent settlement despite enormous obstacles.[^71] His ability to learn indigenous languages, practice traditional medicine, and build cross-cultural relationships represented sophisticated frontier diplomacy that enabled peaceful coexistence when possible and facilitated settlement when necessary.

Supporters of this view emphasize Wu Sha's role in bringing advanced agricultural techniques, Chinese administrative systems, and cultural institutions to a previously underdeveloped region. The rapid transformation of the Kavalan plain from indigenous territory to a prosperous agricultural region producing rice, sugar, and other crops demonstrated the productive potential unleashed by Han settlement.[^72] From this perspective, Wu Sha's colonization created economic opportunities not only for Han settlers but eventually for indigenous peoples who could participate in the new economy, though this claim is hotly contested by indigenous rights advocates.

Wu Sha's military service during the Lin Shuangwen Rebellion receives particular praise in traditional accounts, which present his assistance to Qing government forces as evidence of loyalty and public-spiritedness.[^73] His official recognition with the title "Wu Xin Lang" validated his character and contributions in the eyes of Qing authorities. Defenders argue that Wu Sha worked within the political system of his time, cultivating official support and eventually facilitating formal Qing incorporation of Gamalan, which brought the benefits of imperial administration including law enforcement, taxation systems, and infrastructure development.

The multi-ethnic composition of Wu Sha's settlement coalition has been cited as evidence of his inclusive leadership and ability to transcend the bitter ethnic feuding that plagued much of Taiwan during this period.[^74] Scholars noting that Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Hakka people cooperated in Wu Sha's settlement argue this demonstrated enlightened leadership that prioritized shared interests over parochial ethnic antagonisms. The lasting Hakka presence in Yilan, evidenced by 37 temples to the Three Mountain Kings, reflects this inclusive founding that created space for multiple communities.[^75]

Some defenders argue that Wu Sha's provision of medical care during the 1797 smallpox epidemic demonstrated humanitarian concern for indigenous welfare, not merely strategic calculation.[^76] From this perspective, Wu Sha's medical intervention saved lives and built genuine trust, representing a more benevolent form of frontier interaction than the violent conquest that characterized some other colonial situations. His knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine constituted a valuable resource that benefited indigenous and Han populations alike.

Local historians in Yilan County continue to emphasize Wu Sha's foundational importance to the region's development and prosperity. Contemporary Yilan owes its economic vitality, cultural institutions, and integration into Taiwan's broader society to the settlement processes Wu Sha initiated over two centuries ago. From this perspective, criticizing Wu Sha for colonization applies anachronistic modern standards to historical contexts where territorial expansion and settlement were normal and accepted practices by all contemporaneous societies.

### Negative Views

Critics of Wu Sha, including indigenous rights advocates, postcolonial scholars, and historians emphasizing indigenous perspectives, present a fundamentally different assessment that centers indigenous dispossession and colonial violence. From this perspective, Wu Sha was not a pioneer opening wilderness but a colonizer conquering inhabited land, and his legacy represents the catastrophic beginning of Kavalan displacement and cultural destruction.[^77] The very terminology of "opening" (開) Yilan erases indigenous presence and treats the Kavalan people's homeland as empty space awaiting development, exemplifying the colonial mentality that justified dispossession.[^78]

Critics emphasize the illegal nature of Wu Sha's colonization activities, which violated Qing dynasty laws prohibiting unauthorized settlement in indigenous territories.[^79] The fact that local officials like the Tamsui sub-prefect issued Wu Sha permits and financial support "which was illegal" demonstrates that Wu Sha knowingly circumvented legal protections meant to preserve indigenous lands.[^80] Rather than viewing Wu Sha as working within legitimate political systems, this perspective sees him as a land grabber who exploited sympathetic corrupt officials to advance personal interests at indigenous peoples' expense.

The violent conflicts between Wu Sha's settlers and the Kavalan people, described in historical records as involving "fierce resistance," "heavy casualties," and "frequent fighting," reveal the coercive nature of Han settlement.[^81] The Kavalan people clearly did not welcome Wu Sha's colonization but fought desperately to defend their territory—their defeat resulted from demographic and technological disadvantages rather than voluntary acceptance of Han settlement. The portrayal of these conflicts as regrettable but inevitable obscures the fundamental injustice of armed invasion and territorial conquest.

The 1797 smallpox epidemic that facilitated Wu Sha's successful entry into Toucheng has been interpreted by some critics as a case of disease-aided conquest, whether or not Wu Sha deliberately weaponized the epidemic.[^82] While Wu Sha's medical interventions may have saved some lives, the epidemic devastated Kavalan communities' capacity for resistance, and Wu Sha exploited this vulnerability to advance his colonization objectives. The framing of Wu Sha as a benevolent healer obscures his role as an opportunistic invader who capitalized on indigenous suffering.

The long-term consequences of Wu Sha's colonization demonstrate its catastrophic impact on Kavalan people. The forced migration of most Kavalan people between 1803 and 1840 to marginal areas in Hualien and Taitung counties represented complete territorial dispossession from their ancestral homeland.[^83] "Because of the cultural clashes and bloody turf fights, most of the tribe relocated," a passive phrasing that obscures the active process of violent displacement.[^84] The Kavalan people did not simply "relocate"—they were driven from their land by an overwhelming influx of Han settlers whose presence Wu Sha initiated.

The continuing marginalization of Kavalan people into the late 19th century, including the devastating 1878 Incident Takobowan where Kavalan, Sakizaya, and allies fought Qing forces, demonstrates that Wu Sha's colonization initiated a long process of conflict and indigenous subordination.[^85] The formal Qing incorporation of Gamalan in 1810, which "passively included Lanyang Plain into its territory," ratified the colonial conquest Wu Sha had accomplished through illegal settlement.[^86] Government recognition did not legitimize Wu Sha's actions but rather demonstrated the state's complicity in indigenous dispossession.

Contemporary indigenous rights advocates argue that the celebration of Wu Sha through monuments, historical sites, tourist attractions, and deification represents ongoing colonial violence through historical memory.[^87] The Wu Sha Residence and similar commemorative sites honor a colonizer while erasing indigenous perspectives and suffering, perpetuating narratives that justify historical dispossession and obscure demands for contemporary indigenous justice. For Kavalan people and their descendants, Wu Sha is not a founding father to be celebrated but an invader whose actions destroyed their ancestral community.

Postcolonial scholars emphasize that Wu Sha's colonization was part of broader patterns of Han expansion in Taiwan that systematically dispossessed plains indigenous peoples throughout the island during the Qing dynasty.[^88] Wu Sha's success in Gamalan encouraged further unauthorized settlement and established precedents for illegal colonization followed by government recognition, undermining indigenous territorial rights island-wide. Far from being an isolated pioneer, Wu Sha was an agent of colonial expansion whose activities advanced Han Chinese territorial control at indigenous peoples' expense.

## Famous Quotes

Due to the limited historical documentation of Wu Sha's life and the nature of 18th-century frontier society in Taiwan, no authenticated direct quotations from Wu Sha have been preserved in historical records. Unlike imperial officials, scholars, or literati whose writings and speeches were recorded and transmitted, frontier settlers like Wu Sha rarely left textual records of their own words. What remains are third-party historical accounts and official documents that describe his actions rather than quote his speech.

However, traditional sayings and historical assessments about Wu Sha include:

> "The first person to open Yilan" (開蘭第一人) - Traditional honorific title

This phrase represents the traditional Han Chinese historiographical assessment of Wu Sha's role in pioneering the settlement of Yilan County. The term "open" (開) carries connotations of bringing civilization and development to wilderness, though critics note it erases indigenous presence.[^89]

> "Wu Sha loved socializing with people and quickly learned indigenous Sanliao language" - Historical biographical description

This characterization from historical records emphasizes Wu Sha's sociability and linguistic abilities, which facilitated his relationships with indigenous communities and ultimately enabled his colonization efforts.[^90]

> "Wu Sha, the trailblazer of Yilan County" - Modern tourism and historical materials

Contemporary tourism materials and local histories continue to use this celebratory language to describe Wu Sha's historical role, maintaining the traditional narrative of pioneering development.[^91]
