## Summary
Samuel Little was an American serial killer who confessed to 93 murders committed between 1970 and 2005, making him potentially the most prolific serial killer in U.S. history. The FBI confirmed at least 60 of his confessions. He targeted marginalized women across 19 states.

## Early Life
Born June 7, 1940, in Reynolds, Georgia. He was raised by his grandmother in Ohio. He had a long criminal record including assault, fraud, and drug charges. He was a transient who moved frequently across the country. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1970 and 2005, Little murdered women across at least 19 states. He targeted sex workers, drug addicts, and marginalized women whose deaths were often attributed to overdoses or accidents. He strangled most victims. His mobility and selection of victims who were unlikely to be missed allowed him to evade detection. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Little was arrested in 2012 in a Kentucky homeless shelter on a drug charge. DNA linked him to three murders in Los Angeles, and he was convicted in 2014. In 2018, Texas Ranger James Holland conducted extensive interviews in which Little confessed to 93 murders. The FBI confirmed at least 60. He died in prison on December 30, 2020. [^3]
