## Summary

Rufino Tamayo was a Mexican painter who forged a unique path between the political muralism of Rivera and Orozco and European modernism. His vibrant canvases combine pre-Columbian imagery with Fauvism and Cubism to create a distinctly Mexican modernism. His art celebrates color, form, and Mexican cultural identity without political propaganda.
