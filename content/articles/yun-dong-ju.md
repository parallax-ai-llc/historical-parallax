## Summary

Yun Dong-ju (윤동주, 1917-1945) was a Korean poet celebrated for his lyric poetry and resistance poems written during Japan's brutal occupation of Korea. Born in Longjing, China to Korean settlers, he is widely regarded as one of Korea's most beloved national poets, known for introspective verses that gave voice to the anguish of colonized consciousness while expressing deep longing for freedom and national identity[^1]. His posthumously published collection "Sky, Wind, Stars and Poetry" (1948) became one of the greatest treasures of Korean literature[^2]. At age 27, Yun died under suspicious circumstances in Fukuoka Prison, Japan, where he was imprisoned for alleged anti-Japanese activities, with evidence suggesting he may have been subjected to fatal medical experimentation[^3][^4].

---

## Early Life and Background

Yun Dong-ju was born on December 30, 1917, in Mingdong village (Myeongdong-chon) in Longjing, Jilin Province, China, a region that served as a refuge for Korean settlers fleeing Japanese occupation of their homeland[^5]. He was born as the eldest son among four children to father Yun Yeong-seok (1895-1965) and mother Kim Yong (1891-1948)[^6]. As a child, he was called "Haehwan" (해환, 海煥)[^7]. His family's migration history traces back to 1886, when his great-grandfather moved with the family to the north of Kan-do (間島), making Yun the descendant of Korean settlers in Manchuria who maintained their cultural identity despite displacement[^8].

The Myeongdong Village where Yun grew up was known at the time as a center for the Korean community pursuing national education, independence movement activities, and religious life[^9]. This environment profoundly shaped his consciousness and commitment to Korean identity during a period when his people faced systematic cultural erasure. Yun grew up under the influence of his Presbyterian grandfather, and significantly, his mother's brother was a well-known leader of the Korean independence movement and an educator who built schools and taught Korean national ethos[^10].

His entire educational path reflected his family's commitment to Christian mission schools, which also served as centers of Korean cultural preservation. After studying at Myeongdong School, he moved to Pyongyang and graduated from Soongsil Middle School (now Soongsil High School in Seoul)[^11]. He was baptized in a church in North Korea and grew up immersed in Christian culture as a middle school student, with his Protestant background influencing his choice of educational institutions - Soongsil School and later Yeonhee College, both Protestant schools that maintained Korean educational programs during the colonial period[^12].

In April 1938, Yun entered Yonhi College (now Yonsei University) in Seoul, founded as Chosun Christian College in 1915 with a strong Christian foundation[^13]. He and his first cousin Song Mong-gyu, who would become his inseparable friend and fellow martyr, entered Yonhui College together after having first entered Myeongdong Elementary School together in April 1925[^14]. Yun graduated from Yonhi College on December 27, 1941, at age 23[^15], a significant achievement during a period when Korean higher education faced severe restrictions under colonial rule.

## Rise to Literary Prominence

Unlike many historical figures who "rise to power," Yun Dong-ju's prominence emerged entirely posthumously, as his poetry could not be openly published during his lifetime due to Japanese censorship. His literary development occurred during the darkest period of Japanese colonial rule, when even the Korean language was banned and Koreans were forced to adopt Japanese names[^16]. During this unprecedented colonial oppression, Yun wrote poems of protest that gave voice to the internalized agonies of the colonized consciousness, though he avoided overt propaganda that could invite immediate censorship[^17].

From 1937 onwards, his poems reveal ruthless introspection and anxiety about the dark realities of the times[^18]. His best-known works such as "Foreword" (서시, Seosi), "Self-Portrait" (자화상, Jahwasang), and "A Night of Counting the Stars" (별 헤는 밤, Byeol heneun bam) reached clear literary fruition in terms of their reflection on the inner self and their recognition of nationalist realities, as embodied in the poet's own experiences[^19].

In 1941, as a commemorative gesture for his graduation from Yonhi College, Yun compiled a collection of 19 poems with the title "Sky, Wind, Stars, and Poems" (하늘과 바람과 별과 시, Haneulgwa baramgwa byeolgwa si)[^20]. However, the project was postponed when his trusted professor advised him to wait for a more opportune time, as some of his poems might not pass the censorship of the Japanese authorities. These poems were never published in his lifetime[^21].

In March 1942, seeking to continue his literary education, Yun traveled to Japan and enrolled in the English Literature program at Rikkyo University in Tokyo in April[^22]. During his brief time at Rikkyo, he wrote five poems that survived: "White Shadow" (April 14, 1942), "Flowing Street" (May 12, 1942), "Beloved Memories" (May 13, 1942), "A Poem Written Easily" (June 3, 1942), and "Spring" (date unknown), all written on Rikkyo University letterhead[^23]. One reason reported for his subsequent transfer was that he was troubled by Rikkyo University's drill class, as university students in Tokyo were forced to participate in military training[^24].

After returning from a summer visit to his parents' home, he transferred to the English Literature Department at Doshisha University in Kyoto in October 1942, withdrawing from Rikkyo University[^25]. Song Mong-gyu, his cousin and best friend, had settled in Kyoto first, and Yun, who had always attended mission schools, ended up attending Doshisha University, a mission school in Kyoto[^26]. At Doshisha, the poet focused on English literature classes and learned about the works of Shakespeare and Keats[^27].

## Major Achievements and Literary Contributions

Yun Dong-ju's major achievements lie entirely in his poetry, which embodied resistance to Japanese colonial rule through subtle, introspective expressions of colonized anguish, personal shame, and a quest for moral purity[^28]. His poetry is notable for the childlike persona of his narrators, sensitive awareness of a lost hometown, and an unusual scapegoat mentality deriving from a sense of shame at not being able to lead a conscientious life in a period of gloomy social realities[^29]. Writing during the tumultuous period of Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945), his poetry grapples with themes of national identity, personal guilt, and the search for purity in a time of oppression[^30].

His most famous poem "Foreword" (서시), written on November 20, 1941, is one of the most famous poems in Korea[^31]. Originally a work without a title, it was called "Untitled," but since it decorated the first part of the poetry collection "Sky, Wind, Stars, and Poetry," it served as a preface, and people called it "foreword," which has become the title today[^32]. The poem includes these memorable lines:

> "Wishing not to have / So much as a speck of shame / Toward heaven until the day I die, / I suffered, even when the wind stirred the leaves."[^33]

This verse not only reflects the life and thoughts of the poet himself but also encapsulates the struggles of Korean people under the Japanese colonial era[^34]. The poem embodies Yun's determination to maintain moral integrity and conscience despite overwhelming oppression.

"A Night of Counting the Stars" (별 헤는 밤) is probably the most popular work of Yun Dong-ju, who is one of the best loved poets of the past times in Korea[^35]. The poem was completed in 1941 while Yun was attending Yonhui College but could only be published posthumously due to Japanese censorship[^36]. This work, along with "Self-Portrait" and other poems, demonstrates his mastery of using spare language and natural imagery to explore the complex emotions of helplessness and longing experienced under colonial rule[^37].

Yun's poetry makes clear that it is through unsparing self-examination that one might achieve a conscience adapted to the times[^38]. His poems often express a deep sense of guilt and self-reproach, reflecting his belief that individuals bear responsibility for the fate of their nation—this introspective and self-critical approach distinguishes Yun's work from the overtly nationalistic poetry common during the colonial period[^39]. His determination to be a poet of unwavering self-reflection distinguishes him from many others of the period whose militant nationalism, or dejected escapism, were symptomatic of the malaise afflicting colonial Korea[^40].

By the time of his death, Yun had written over 100 poems[^41], creating a body of work that used simple diction and straightforward expressions to sing of his love for his people, his compassion for the poor and destitute, and his hopes for freedom and independence—themes that still resonate deep within the hearts of the Korean people[^42]. His poetry collection, divided into three chapters, begins with the first chapter "Self-portrait" (자화상), which includes "Foreword" and "The Poem Easily Written" (쉽게 쓰여진 시). The second chapter starts with "A Night of Counting Stars" (별 헤는 밤), and the final chapter starts with "Bed-wetter's Map" (오줌싸개 지도)[^43].

## Arrest, Imprisonment, and Death

On July 14, 1943, as he was traveling home for the summer holidays, Yun Dong-ju was arrested as a "thought criminal" by the Japanese police and detained at the Kamogawa Police Station in Kyoto[^44]. He was arrested for alleged anti-Japanese movements and violations of the Maintenance of the Public Order Act[^45]. The following year, the Kyoto regional court sentenced him to two years of prison on the charge of having participated in the independence movement[^46]. He was sentenced together with Song Mong-gyu, his cousin and inseparable friend, and both were transferred to Fukuoka Prison[^47].

Yun's time at Doshisha University was tragically cut short after less than a year of study. A poetry stone to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his death was erected in front of the Doshisha University chapel in February 1995[^48], recognizing the significance of his brief time there and the injustice of his arrest.

While imprisoned in Fukuoka, Yun Dong-ju died at the age of 27 on February 16, 1945, just months before Korea's liberation from Japanese rule[^49]. Song Mong-gyu also died in prison, following Yun's death[^50]. The circumstances of Yun's death remain controversial and deeply disturbing.

His cause of death in Fukuoka prison is uncertain, but theories have been raised based on accounts of saltwater injections and medical experiments performed at that prison[^51]. According to Song Mong-gyu, who was imprisoned with Yun, both of them were receiving unknown injections every day[^52]. Other testimonies related to Yun's death were found in Japanese war crimes trial documents created in 1948, which stated that Fukuoka prisoners were given intravenous injections of saline solution to determine if it could be used as a substitute for blood plasma[^53].

Eiichi Konoo, who majored in Korean literature at Dongguk University Graduate School, wrote an article in the May 1980 issue of Modern Literature magazine asserting that Yun Dong-ju and Song Mong-gyu were actually murdered because they were used as experimental materials for a blood replacement experiment[^54]. The Japanese military was conducting research on developing saline solution due to the war regime, and it was revealed that Yun was selected as a test subject at Fukuoka Prison, with the injection presumed to be sea water[^55].

In 2009, SBS "I Want to Know" investigated the conspiracy related to Yun's death, revealing that the Japanese military was conducting research on developing saline solution due to the war regime, and that Yun was selected as a test subject for the scandalous crime of participating in the independence movement at Fukuoka Prison[^56]. The controversy remains unresolved, with the exact cause of death still uncertain, though the evidence strongly suggests his possible death as a result of medical experimentation involving saline or seawater injections[^57].

## Personal Life and Character

Yun Dong-ju's personal life was characterized by deep religiosity, intense moral conscience, and profound commitment to both his Korean identity and his Christian faith. Growing up under the influence of his Presbyterian grandfather, his faith shaped not only his worldview but also his poetic vision[^58]. His Christian, nationalist background is considered by some scholars to lie at the root of his poetics[^59].

His relationship with his cousin Song Mong-gyu was one of the defining personal connections of his life. The two were inseparable friends who shared a lifelong connection, entering Myeongdong Elementary School together in April 1925, later entering Yonhui College together in April 1938, and eventually studying together at Doshisha University before being arrested and dying together in Japanese custody[^60]. This profound friendship reflected not only family bonds but also shared commitment to Korean identity and resistance to colonial oppression.

Yun's poetry reveals a personality marked by extraordinary self-criticism and moral sensitivity. Scholars characterize his poetics as the "poetics of shame," noting that having lived during the Japanese occupation, Yun seems to have felt constantly ashamed of himself for lacking the courage to engage in more direct resistance activities and choosing instead to study and seek transcendental beauty in nature[^61]. This sense of shame was not unique to him but could be applied to almost all Korean intellectuals who studied in Japan during that period[^62].

Despite the extreme personal anguish and shame resulting from the intensity of his inner struggle, he "glows more brightly today than those other poets who more easily compromised with their times"[^63]. His unwavering commitment to self-reflection and moral purity, even in the face of overwhelming pressure to compromise, reveals a character of exceptional integrity and courage—a quiet courage manifested not in militant action but in steadfast refusal to betray his conscience or his people.

His poetry often features a childlike narrator and exhibits sensitive awareness of lost homeland and displacement[^64], reflecting his personal experience of being born in exile in China, never having lived in Korea proper, yet carrying profound longing for a homeland he knew primarily through family memory and cultural identity. This liminal position—Korean by identity and commitment, yet geographically displaced—deepened the poignancy of his poetry and his personal sense of incompleteness and longing.

## Legacy and Cultural Impact

Yun Dong-ju's legacy has grown exponentially since his death, transforming him from an unknown poet who died in obscurity to one of Korea's most cherished cultural figures. In January 1948, three years after his death, 31 of his poems were published by Jeongeumsa (정음사, 正音社), together with an introduction by the fellow poet Chong Ji-yong[^65]. This work, titled "Sky, Wind, Star, and Poem" (하늘과 바람과 별과 시, Haneulgwa baramgwa byeolgwa si), had a huge impact[^66]. With the appearance of this volume, Yun came into the spotlight as a resistance poet of the late occupation period[^67].

His posthumously published collection of poems under the title "Sky, Wind, Stars, and Poetry" is one of the all-time favorites of Korean readers and is regarded as one of the greatest treasures of Korean literature[^68]. The work continues to resonate across generations of Koreans, with its themes of love for the Korean people, compassion for the poor and destitute, and hopes for freedom and independence remaining deeply relevant[^69].

In a 1986 survey, Yun was selected as 'the most popular poet amongst the youth' and his popularity continues to this day[^70]. In 2007, he was listed by the Korean Poets' Association among the ten most important modern Korean poets[^71]. He is widely considered Korea's "National Poet" and is "undoubtedly one of Korea's most well-known and beloved poets"[^72].

The government of South Korea recognized Yun's contributions to the independence movement by awarding him the Order of Merit for National Foundation (Independence Medal) on August 15, 1990[^73], forty-five years after his death. In recognition of his meritorious service, this posthumous award acknowledged both his literary achievements and his sacrifice for Korean independence[^74].

In November 1968, Yonsei University and others established an endowment for the Yun Dong-ju Poetry Prize[^75], ensuring his legacy would inspire future generations of Korean poets. Yonsei remodeled Pinson Hall, where Yun's dorm room was located during his college years, and in 2020 renamed it Yun Dong-ju Memorial Hall to celebrate what would have been his 100th birthday[^76]. The memorial hall consists of three floors of exhibition and library space, preserving the poet's relics and creating a space where his spirit lives and breathes[^77].

A 2016 biographical film "Dongju: The Portrait of a Poet" brought renewed attention to his life and work[^78]. The movie resonated deeply with Koreans because of the history, and was "definitely so much more emotional for Koreans" than for non-Korean audiences[^79]. For Korean students who learn Yun's poems in class, the film helped them understand him "as a human not only poet," making his life more accessible and relatable[^80]. The film offered "a sober account of a difficult time in modern Korean history" and drew surprisingly large Korean audiences despite its artistic, black-and-white presentation[^81].

Rikkyo University in Tokyo, where Yun briefly studied in 1942, has also commemorated him with memorials, recognizing his significance to both Korean and Japanese understanding of the colonial period[^82]. These commemorations across Korea and Japan reflect the transnational dimensions of his legacy and the enduring power of his poetry to transcend national boundaries while speaking to specific historical injustices.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views and Scholarly Praise

Yun Dong-ju is revered for his poetry, which expresses the complex feelings of pain, guilt, and disillusionment wrought by Japanese colonialism[^83]. A graduate of Yonhee College, the forerunner of today's Yonsei University, he effectively conveyed the split-consciousness of the colonial subject and the sense of disempowerment that accompanies it[^84]. Scholars praise his ability to articulate universal human experiences of oppression while remaining rooted in the specific historical context of Korean colonial suffering.

Song WooHye's critical biography chronicles Yun's life as one of the most beloved poets in the modern Korean literary canon, incorporating newly discovered materials and interviews with the poet's family and friends as the most comprehensive, definitive biography of Yun to date[^85]. Academic scholarship has consistently recognized the literary quality of his work beyond its historical significance, noting his mastery of lyric form, his sophisticated use of natural imagery, and his ability to convey profound emotional and philosophical complexity through deceptively simple language.

With the posthumous publication of his works, Yun came into the spotlight as a resistance poet of the late occupation period, recognized as one of the conscientious intellectuals who based his poems on criticism and self-reflection of the Japanese colonial government[^86]. His work embodies a quiet yet profound resistance, distinguishing him from both militant nationalist poets and those who compromised with colonial authorities[^87]. The enduring popularity of his poetry across multiple generations demonstrates its ability to speak to fundamental human experiences of conscience, identity, and moral struggle.

In postcolonial scholarship, Yun's poetry has traditionally been interpreted through a nationalist lens that emphasizes his role as a symbol of resistance against Japanese imperialism, highlighting themes of ethnic consciousness and colonial suffering[^88]. For many Koreans, his life and death represent the ultimate sacrifice for national identity, making him a martyr-poet whose literary achievement is inseparable from his political commitment.

### Negative Views and Critical Reassessments

While overwhelmingly celebrated, Yun Dong-ju's legacy has also been subject to critical reassessment and scholarly debate, particularly regarding nationalist interpretations of his work. Recent academic perspectives, emerging since the early 2000s, challenge the entrenched nationalism by reframing Yun's work as a subjective exploration of personal anguish under colonial violence, rather than solely a vehicle for ethnic solidarity[^89].

Against the backdrop of the national program of valorization with its appeal to the historical, political, and cultural collectivity of the Korean people, scholarly work has emerged that proposes to highlight the properly universal question of the speaking/writing subject, which constitutes the very literary property of Yun's legacy, rather than reading him solely through a nationalist lens[^90]. Academic work on "The Canonization of Yoon Dong-ju's Poetry and the Transcendence of the National Horizon" suggests critical engagement with moving beyond nationalist interpretations[^91].

Some scholars argue that reading Yun demonstrates how the problem of (post)colonial national history ought to, and can only, be finally engaged and resolved as subjective process and arrival[^92], emphasizing the personal and existential dimensions of his poetry over collective nationalist meanings. This perspective suggests that reducing Yun's complex literary achievement to nationalist symbolism may actually diminish the universal and deeply human qualities that give his poetry its enduring power.

The "poetics of shame" that characterizes Yun's work has also been subject to varied interpretation. While some view his sense of shame as noble self-reflection and moral conscience, others note that this taint of shame is not unique to him but can be applied to almost all Korean intellectuals who studied in Japan during the colonial period[^93]. This raises questions about whether Yun's moral anguish represents exceptional courage or reflects the broader compromised position of colonial-era intellectuals who pursued education within the colonial system while harboring anti-colonial sentiments.

A more recent controversy involves China's claims regarding Yun's identity and nationality. A plaque near a memorial describes Yun as a "Chinese ethnic Korean patriotic poet," which has been criticized as "historical distortion"[^94]. However, it would be a complex issue to judge his nationality using contemporary political standards, given that Yun was an ethnic Korean poet who lived his life at a time when South Korea did not exist as a modern nation-state, and historical forces deprived him of a homeland to match his identity[^95]. This ongoing China-Korea dispute over Yun's national identity reflects contemporary geopolitical tensions rather than historical reality, but it also raises legitimate questions about how we categorize individuals whose lives straddled multiple political jurisdictions and whose identities were formed in contexts of displacement and statelessness.
