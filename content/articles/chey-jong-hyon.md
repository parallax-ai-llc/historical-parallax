## Summary

Chey Jong-hyon (1929-1998) was a transformative Korean business leader who built SK Group into one of South Korea's largest conglomerates. As chairman from 1973 to 1998, he pioneered vertical integration strategies spanning oil, petrochemicals, and telecommunications, while establishing groundbreaking management systems. Beyond business, he founded the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies in 1974 and launched extensive reforestation projects, demonstrating early commitment to social responsibility. His leadership helped shape modern Korean capitalism during the country's rapid industrialization.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Chey Jong-hyon was born on November 21, 1929, in Suwon, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, during the Japanese colonial period.[^3] His parents instilled in him a challenging spirit and passion—his father taught him to have great morale, while his mother embraced him with warmth and compassion.[^4] Growing up in a period of profound historical turbulence, Chey witnessed both colonial oppression and the subsequent Korean War, experiences that would shape his determination to contribute to Korea's economic development.

In 1950, Chey enrolled at Seoul National University, majoring in agricultural engineering, but the outbreak of the Korean War that same year forced him to suspend his studies.[^5] Seeking better educational opportunities and escaping the devastation of war, he departed for the United States in 1954. This decision would prove pivotal in shaping his worldview and business philosophy.

In America, Chey pursued studies in chemistry, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.[^6] He then continued to the University of Chicago, where he earned a Master of Arts degree in Economics.[^7] During his time at the University of Chicago, he met his future wife, Park Kye-hee (also spelled Kae Hee), at International House, the university's residential community for international students.[^8] These early study-abroad experiences in the United States laid the foundations for Chey Jong-hyon to be recognized as an economist equipped with robust theoretical knowledge, combining Western management techniques with Eastern cultural values.[^9]

The American educational experience profoundly influenced Chey's thinking. He absorbed Western approaches to business efficiency in marketing and production while maintaining skepticism about Western human resource management, believing that "the Oriental way of thinking is more useful" for motivating people.[^10] This synthesis of East and West would become a hallmark of his management philosophy.

## Rise to Power

With the passing of his father in 1962, Chey Jong-hyon returned to Korea, where he was appointed Vice President of Sunkyong Textiles, a company then led by his older brother, Choi Jong-kun (the surname variation stemming from different romanization choices).[^11] Sunkyong Textiles had been founded in 1953 when the Chey family acquired it from the South Korean government as abandoned property of Japan following the Korean War.[^12]

For over a decade, Chey worked under his brother's leadership, gaining practical experience in textile manufacturing and business operations. This apprenticeship period allowed him to understand the company's operations intimately while developing his own vision for expansion. In 1962, SK Textile became the first South Korean company to export rayon fabrics, marking an early achievement in the company's international ambitions.[^13]

The turning point came in 1973 when Choi Jong-kun died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 47.[^14] In an unusual move for Korean conglomerates, Choi Jong-kun transferred leadership to his younger brother Chey Jong-hyon rather than to his own sons, who were in their twenties and teens and deemed too young to lead the company.[^15] This decision reflected the founder's confidence in his brother's capabilities and judgment.

When Chey Jong-hyon assumed chairmanship in 1973, he inherited a company facing potentially fatal challenges. The global economy was reeling from the first oil crisis, and the geopolitical situation was precarious.[^16] The business was primarily a mid-sized textile manufacturer with growth potential but limited diversification. Rather than viewing these challenges as insurmountable obstacles, Chey saw them as opportunities for transformation.

Almost immediately upon taking leadership, Chey began implementing his vision for vertical integration. In 1973, he established Sunkyong Oil (later SK Innovation), beginning an ambitious strategy to manage production "From Petroleum to Fibers."[^17] During his New Year's Greetings in 1975, Chairman Chey announced this vertical integration of business divisions ranging from oil to fiber, a bold proclamation that would guide the company's development for decades.[^18]

## Major Achievements

### Vertical Integration Strategy

Chey Jong-hyon's most significant strategic achievement was implementing a comprehensive vertical integration model across the petrochemical value chain. Applying this model to the production of petrochemicals, film, thread, and fiber, Chey set forth an ambitious goal of turning Sunkyong into a world-class energy and chemical company.[^19]

The group had entered petrochemicals in 1969 with the founding of Sunkyong Chemical Co. to produce polyester fibers and related materials.[^20] Under Chey's leadership, this initiative expanded dramatically. The commencement of operations at all nine factories at the CLX Ulsan complex in June 1991 marked the completion of the company's efforts to achieve vertical integration from oil to textiles.[^21] The construction cost for these new plants totaled KRW 1.5 trillion, requiring between 1 year and 11 months to 3 years to construct.[^22]

### Acquisition of Korea Oil Corporation

In November 1980, Chey Jong-hyon made his most audacious move by acquiring the Korea Oil Corporation (KOCO), a state-owned company suffering from chronic deficits.[^23] The Korean government had decided to privatize KOCO and selected Sunkyong as the acquirer, acknowledging the company's proven ability to secure crude oil and financing through two previous oil crises.[^24]

The government's request for help came at a fortuitous moment. Chey had been attempting to establish a refining facility in Ulsan after securing a promise from Saudi Arabia to supply 150,000 barrels of crude per day.[^25] The KOCO acquisition allowed him to realize this long-cherished dream of entering the oil business while serving national economic interests by rescuing a failing state enterprise.

Chey achieved both a stable supply of crude oil and the rapid normalization of KOCO's management.[^26] In December 1980, this acquisition made SK Korea's fifth largest conglomerate.[^27] The successful turnaround of KOCO demonstrated Chey's management acumen and solidified SK Group's position as a major player in South Korea's energy industry.

### SK Management System (SKMS)

In March 1979, during the global economic downturn following the second oil shock, Chey Jong-hyon established the SK Management System (SKMS), believing that "corporate management must be enabled by principles" rather than focusing on immediate crises.[^28] The creation of a comprehensive business management system in the 1970s was not only unique in Korea but was also globally unprecedented.[^29]

Based on the view that unstructured, haphazard business management cannot ensure sustainable growth as companies become large-scale and globalized, Chey defined SK's business philosophy and goals and established a coherent management methodology to be applied to daily business operations.[^30] SKMS was developed through a four-year process of research and discussion, combining theoretical rigor with practical business insights.[^31]

The system introduced SUPEX (Super Excellent), a business management strategy that aims to systemically eliminate defects and maximize perfection, as the core principle behind SKMS—a philosophy equivalent to Johnson & Johnson's "Our Credo" and Toyota's "Toyota Way."[^32] Since its inauguration in 1979, SKMS has been updated 13 times to maintain SK's core philosophy while boosting execution capabilities of affiliates in response to changing business environments.[^33]

### Telecommunications Revolution

Chey Jong-hyon demonstrated remarkable foresight in recognizing the potential of the telecommunications industry. After ten years of meticulous preparation, SK participated in the open tender of Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corporation's shares in 1994, acquiring a 23% stake at KRW 335,000 per share, higher than the market price.[^34] In June 1994, SK Group became Korea Mobile Telecommunications Corporation's largest shareholder.[^35]

This acquisition reflected Chey's insight into future growth prospects and self-confidence born from extensive preparation.[^36] KMTC officially joined the SK Group in January 1997 and changed its name to SK Telecom in March of that year.[^37] By 1997, the company succeeded in acquiring Korea Mobile Telecom and rebranded the business as SK Telecom, making Sunkyong the leading mobile telephone service provider in Korea with a 50 percent market share.[^38]

In January 1996, SK Telecom launched Korea's first commercial CDMA cellular phone service in Incheon and Bucheon.[^39] Through these excellent insights and bold decisions, Chey grew the SK group into one of the top five corporate groups in Korea, with revenues exceeding $30 billion by the time of his death.[^40]

### Philanthropic Initiatives

Beyond business, Chey Jong-hyon established the Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies (KFAS) in 1974, Korea's first scholarship foundation established by a private company.[^41] He founded it with the great ambition to "build a world class nation, world class citizens, and an industrial society founded on intellectual excellence."[^42]

Over the past four decades, KFAS has supported approximately 750 brilliant Korean individuals to earn PhDs at world-class universities including Harvard University and Stanford University through its Overseas PhD Program.[^43] As of June 2024, KFAS's world-class scholar training program has produced a total of 4,261 scholarship students, including 861 PhD degree holders.[^44] Unlike other scholarships of the era that required students to return to Korea or work at specific institutions, Chey Jong-hyon asked only that students cultivate themselves into global scholars, reflecting his philosophy of unconditional support for talent development.[^45]

### Environmental Stewardship

Starting with Gwangdeoksan (Mt. Indeung) in Chungju in 1972, Chey laid the basis for the development of four forests in central parts of the country.[^46] He founded Seohae Development Co. Ltd. (currently SK Forest) and began the first corporate forestation business in Korea.[^47] Buying 40 million square meters of land, he implemented modern and scientific afforestation techniques.[^48]

Now containing 3.8 million trees including 80 landscape plant species, the combined size of the forests amounts to 4,100 hectares, 14 times the size of Yeouido in Seoul.[^49] The timber harvested from the forestlands at a rotational interval of 30 years provides additional sources of income for scholarships.[^50] He had a philosophy of planting trees with the belief "to cultivate trees like cultivating people and cultivate people like cultivating trees."[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Chaebol System Criticisms

As the leader of one of South Korea's major chaebols (family-controlled conglomerates), Chey Jong-hyon operated within a system that has drawn substantial criticism. The chaebol culture has been criticized for stifling creativity, concentrating political power in the hands of leading families rather than maximizing profits, providing an unfair playing field for small and medium-sized enterprises, and excluding women and divergent voices from management.[^52]

Chaebol involvement in politics fostered corruption, including the bribing of prominent South Korean politicians such as former presidents Chun Doo-Hwan and Roh Tae-Woo during their terms in office.[^53] Former South Korean President Roh Tae-woo had provided a protective shield for SK's chairman Chey Jong-hyon, according to court verdicts, underscoring the intricate relationship between family, politics, and business in South Korea.[^54]

Critics argued that the chaebol's dominance was suffocating the country's attempt to shift gears and foster a more innovative services-oriented economy powered by small businesses.[^55] The concentration of economic power in a few family-controlled conglomerates raised questions about fairness, competition, and democratic governance of the economy.

### Succession and Dynastic Control

Like many other chaebols, SK Group's chairmanship was 'inherited' from father to son: from Chey Jong-hyon to his eldest son Chey Tae-won.[^56] This dynastic succession pattern perpetuated concerns about meritocracy and concentrated wealth within elite families. While Chey Jong-hyon himself had assumed leadership from his brother rather than inheriting directly from his father, he passed control to his son, continuing the family dynasty.

### Son's Criminal Convictions

The Chey family's reputation was significantly damaged by legal troubles involving Chey Jong-hyon's son and successor, Chey Tae-won. In 2003, Chey Tae-won was convicted on fraud charges and sentenced to three years for his part in a $1.2 billion accounting fraud, though he was freed after just three months.[^57]

Later, Chey Tae-won was convicted of embezzling 46.5 billion won ($43.6 million) from two SK Group affiliates, including SK Telecom, and funneling the funds into personal investments in stock futures and options in 2008.[^58] He was sentenced to four years in prison in January 2013 and served two years and six months before receiving a controversial pardon in August 2015.[^59]

The pardon generated significant controversy. The Citizens' Coalition for Economic Justice stated, "It is regretful to hear that the pardon for 14 businessmen include people who severely damaged economic order. There is no objective proof that the pardon on the ground of boosting the economy actually worked."[^60] Critics said "The pardon is against fair market order and transparency."[^61]

### Questions About Business Practices

There were suspicions that Chey Tae-won's group donated large sums of money in 2015 to two nonprofit organizations controlled by former president Park Geun-hye's longtime friend Choi Soon-sil, in return for a presidential pardon, though the chairman reportedly denied all allegations.[^62] Such allegations, whether proven or not, cast shadows over the integrity of the Chey family's business operations and political connections.

## Personal Life

Chey Jong-hyon married Park Kye-hee (also spelled Kae Hee), whom he met at International House during his studies at the University of Chicago.[^63] Their marriage represented a partnership that would span decades and support Chey's ambitious business endeavors. Park Kye-hee stood by her husband through the challenges of building SK Group into a major conglomerate.

The couple had three children: two sons and a daughter.[^64] Their eldest son, Chey Tae-won, was born on December 3, 1960, and did graduate work in economics at the University of Chicago, following in his father's academic footsteps.[^65] Both sons went on to work for SK Group affiliates, ensuring continuity of family involvement in the business.[^66] Their daughter, Chey Keewon, earned an AM degree in 1991 and pursued studies in music, representing a different path from the business world.[^67]

Chey Jong-hyon was known for his people-centered management philosophy. He always emphasized "People come first," stating that "All businesses start and end with people. In that sense, people should be the first priority."[^68] This conviction shaped not only his business operations but also his philanthropic work, particularly in education and human resource development.

In describing his philosophy on long-term investment in human resources, he said "Humans and trees have something in common" in that both grow and mature throughout their entire life.[^69] He believed in the principle to "cultivate trees like cultivating people and cultivate people like cultivating trees."[^70] He advised: "If you stop trying after a couple of failures, you won't see any results. You should invest in the long term. Don't even spit a word about failure."[^71]

Chey believed that "the profits of a business fundamentally belong to society, and therefore, must be given back to society."[^72] This conviction drove his focus on forestation efforts and nurturing future talent, often credited with opening the doors for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) management in Korea.[^73]

Chey Jong-hyon battled lung cancer in his final years. Despite his illness, he continued working on behalf of Korea's economy. During the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, while battling lung cancer, he met with the Managing Director of the IMF to protest against its policies toward Korea and negotiate more beneficial programs for the nation's economy.[^74] After being elected President of the Federation of Korean Industries in 1993, he devoted himself to reviving the Korean economy and proposed policies to the government while holding the Private Council on National Competitiveness monthly, having anticipated the 1997 financial crisis.[^75]

Chey Jong-hyon passed away from lung cancer on August 26, 1998, at the age of 69 in Seoul.[^76] His choice to be cremated was groundbreaking in Korean society, where burial had been the traditional method. Chey's case, which was widely reported in the media, acted as a catalyst for changing the perception of cremation. The cremation rate went up to 30 percent in the following year, and now stands at 82 percent.[^77] Even in death, he influenced Korean society's cultural practices and environmental consciousness.

## Legacy

### Business Transformation

Chey Jong-hyon's most enduring legacy is the transformation of a mid-sized textile company into a global conglomerate encompassing petrochemicals and information technology industries.[^78] Over 25 years, he laid the foundation for SK as a global corporation and representative of Korea by turning crises into opportunities for growth amid rapidly changing domestic and international circumstances.[^79]

By the time of his death in 1998, he had guided SK Group to a position as South Korea's fourth largest chaebol, with revenues of more than $30 billion.[^80] The company he built continues to be one of South Korea's largest conglomerates, with SK Telecom, SK Innovation, and SK Hynix among its major subsidiaries operating globally.

In 1998, the same year as his death, the group changed its name from Sunkyong Group to SK Group, marking a new era while honoring the foundation he had built.[^81] The rebranding symbolized the company's evolution from a domestic Korean textile manufacturer to a global energy, telecommunications, and technology conglomerate.

### Management Philosophy

The SK Management System (SKMS) that Chey established in 1979 continues to guide the company's operations decades later. In 2016, SKMS explicitly named social value creation as a corporate management mission together with economic values, stipulating focus on responsibilities toward society at large.[^82] This evolution reflects Chey's original vision that businesses exist not merely for profit but to contribute to society.

His synthesis of Western management efficiency with Eastern values regarding human resources created a distinctive corporate culture that balanced performance with people-centered approaches. This management philosophy has influenced Korean business practices beyond SK Group, demonstrating the far-reaching impact of his ideas.

### Educational Impact

The Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies stands as perhaps Chey's most personally meaningful legacy. With its 100-year vision to "build a world class nation, world class citizens, and an industrial society founded on intellectual excellence," KFAS has profoundly impacted Korean higher education and scholarship.[^83]

The 4,261 scholarship students, including 861 PhD holders from world-class universities, represent an extraordinary investment in human capital.[^84] These scholars have gone on to become professors, researchers, business leaders, and policymakers, multiplying Chey's impact across generations. His unconditional support for students without requiring them to work at SK Group or even return to Korea demonstrated remarkable faith in the long-term benefits of education for society as a whole.[^85]

### Environmental Conservation

The four forests totaling 4,100 hectares with 3.8 million trees represent one of the earliest corporate environmental initiatives in Korea.[^86] Starting in 1972, decades before corporate social responsibility became fashionable, Chey demonstrated that businesses could contribute to environmental conservation while generating sustainable income through timber harvesting to fund scholarships.[^87]

This integration of environmental stewardship with educational philanthropy exemplified Chey's holistic approach to corporate social responsibility. The forests continue to grow and provide environmental benefits, serving as living monuments to his vision.

### Cultural Influence

Chey's decision to be cremated rather than buried, and the subsequent cultural shift this catalyzed, demonstrates how influential leaders can shape societal practices beyond business. The cremation rate's dramatic increase from below 20% in the 1990s to 82% today reflects changing environmental consciousness and practical considerations about land use in densely populated Korea.[^88]

### Recognition and Honors

Chey Jong-hyon received numerous prestigious awards recognizing his contributions. These included the Prime Minister Award (1971), Silver Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit (1972), Gold Tower Order of Industrial Service Merit (1973, 1997), CEO of the Year Award (1980), International Executive of the Year Award (1995), Order of Civil Merit Mugunghwa Medal (1998), and James A. Van Fleet Award (1998).[^89]

In June 1995, he returned to the University of Chicago campus to receive the University's 1995 Alumni Medal.[^90] The James A. Van Fleet Award he received in 1998, just months before his death, recognized his outstanding contributions to the promotion of U.S.-Korea relations.[^91] In 2017, his son Chey Tae-won received the same award, making the Cheys the first family to receive multiple Van Fleet Awards.[^92]

Posthumously, he was awarded the New Millennium Entrepreneurship Award in 2001.[^93] SK Group has established the SK Heritage Museum and digitized archives of Chey's documents, preserving his legacy for future generations.[^94]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and business historians credit Chey Jong-hyon as one of the tycoons who contributed to Korea's rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s.[^95] When he took over as chairman from his older brother, SK Group was a midsize company with growth potential, but under his leadership, it grew into one of Korea's top five conglomerates.[^96]

Academics emphasize his role in pioneering systematic business management in Korea. The establishment of SKMS in 1979 represented a level of management sophistication unprecedented not only in Korea but globally at that time.[^97] This contribution to professionalizing Korean business management extended far beyond SK Group, as other companies studied and adapted similar systematic approaches.

Educational leaders praise his visionary philanthropy through KFAS. The foundation's approach of providing unconditional support for talented students to study at world-class universities, without requiring payback or specific service commitments, was revolutionary in Korean philanthropic culture.[^98] The 750 PhDs produced through KFAS have made incalculable contributions to Korean academia, research, and policy-making.[^99]

Environmental advocates recognize Chey as an early pioneer of corporate environmental responsibility. His forestation projects beginning in 1972 predated the modern environmental movement in Korea by decades.[^100] The integration of environmental conservation with sustainable income generation for educational purposes demonstrated sophisticated thinking about corporate social responsibility.

The University of Chicago recognizes Chey as an exemplar of how international education can transform individuals who then transform their societies. His journey from war-torn Korea to American universities and back to build a major corporation while investing in the next generation of scholars represents the best outcomes of international educational exchange.[^101]

Business leaders admire his strategic vision in recognizing the potential of vertical integration, the oil industry, and telecommunications before these became obvious opportunities. His acquisition of the deficit-ridden Korea Oil Corporation in 1980 and successful turnaround demonstrated both business acumen and willingness to take calculated risks for national economic benefit.[^102]

### Negative Views

Critics view Chey Jong-hyon as a representative of the problematic chaebol system that concentrates economic and political power in family hands. While acknowledging his individual capabilities, they argue that the system he operated within and perpetuated undermines fair competition, democratic governance, and economic opportunity for those outside elite circles.[^103]

Economists critical of chaebols point out that while Chey and SK Group contributed to Korea's rapid industrialization, the dominance of conglomerates has subsequently hindered the development of a more balanced, innovative economy. The chaebol model that worked for rapid catch-up industrialization may impede the transition to a knowledge-based, entrepreneurial economy.[^104]

Labor advocates criticize the paternalistic "people-first" rhetoric as masking fundamentally hierarchical, authoritarian management practices typical of chaebols. While Chey spoke of valuing people, the chaebol system he led has been criticized for excluding diverse voices, particularly women, from leadership positions.[^105]

Political analysts emphasize the problematic relationships between chaebols and political leaders. The revelation that President Roh Tae-woo provided a "protective shield" for Chey highlights how business success in Korea has often depended on political connections rather than purely market competition.[^106] This undermines the narrative of entrepreneurial success based solely on vision and hard work.

Governance experts point to the dynastic succession from Chey Jong-hyon to his son Chey Tae-won as epitomizing the chaebol problem. Regardless of Chey Tae-won's qualifications, the principle that Korea's largest companies should pass from father to son contradicts meritocratic principles and perpetuates concentrated wealth and power.[^107]

The criminal convictions of Chey Tae-won for accounting fraud and embezzlement, and the controversial pardon he received, reinforce criticisms that chaebol leaders operate under different rules than ordinary citizens. Critics argue that the elder Chey's legacy is tarnished by the governance failures and criminal behavior of his chosen successor.[^108]

Some scholars question whether the philanthropic activities, while laudable, were partly motivated by image management and political relationships rather than pure altruism. The timing of major philanthropic initiatives sometimes coincided with periods when chaebols faced public criticism or sought government favors.[^109]

Environmental critics note that while Chey's forestation projects were pioneering, SK Group's core businesses in oil refining and petrochemicals have contributed significantly to environmental pollution and carbon emissions. The forests, while beneficial, represent a tiny fraction of the environmental footprint of SK's industrial operations.[^110]
