## Overview

Roald Amundsen (1872 – 1928) was the consummate professional of polar exploration. While the British romanticized "heroic struggle," Amundsen prioritized efficiency and survival. On December 14, 1911, he became the first person to reach the geographic South Pole, beating his British rival Robert Falcon Scott by 34 days. The contrast between the two expeditions is a case study in leadership and planning: Amundsen's team gained weight on the return journey and lost no men, while Scott's entire team perished. Amundsen's secret was his humility—he learned from the Inuit of the Arctic rather than trying to conquer nature with industrial technology.

## The Northwest Passage (Preparation)

Before the South Pole, Amundsen spent 3 years (1903-1906) conquering the **Northwest Passage** in a tiny sloop, the *Gjoa*.
During this time among the Netsilik Inuit, he learned:
1.  **Clothing:** Furs (caribou/seal) vent sweat and keep warm. Wool freezes.
2.  **Transport:** Dog sleds are superior to man-hauling.
3.  **Diet:** Fresh meat prevents scurvy.

## The Great Race

Amundsen’s original dream was the North Pole.
In 1909, news arrived that Peary and Cook claimed the North Pole. Amundsen was crushed and deeply in debt.
He secretly changed plans. He told only his brother and his ship commander.
**The Deception:**
He sailed south from Norway, ostensibly "going around Cape Horn to approach the North Pole via Bering Strait."
At Madeira (off Africa), he gathered his crew and revealed the truth: *"We are going South."*
He sent a telegram to Scott: *"Beg to inform you Fram proceeding Antarctic. Amundsen."*

## Strategy: Amundsen vs Scott

### Amundsen (The Professional)
*   **Base:** Bay of Whales (on the Ross Ice Shelf). 60 miles closer to the Pole than Scott, but risky (ice could break).
*   **Transport:** 52 Greenland Huskies.
    *   **The Calculated Cruelty:** He planned to start with many dogs and kill the weaker ones along the journey to feed the remaining dogs and the men (fresh meat).
*   **Skills:** All men were expert skiers.
*   **Markers:** Used dried fish painted black to mark the route every mile (visible in whiteout).

### Scott (The Amateur/Romantic)
*   **Base:** McMurdo Sound (Solid ground, safer).
*   **Transport:** Mixed bag.
    *   **Motor Sledges:** Engines cracked in the cold.
    *   **Ponies:** Hooves sank in snow. They sweat and froze. Had to be shot early.
    *   **Man-Hauling:** British belief that hauling sleds yourself was "nobler." It burned 6,000 calories/day.

## The Journey to 90° South

**Start:** Oct 19, 1911. 5 Men (Amundsen, Bjaaland, Hanssen, Hassel, Wisting).
**The Axel Heiberg Glacier:**
They discovered a new route up the Transantarctic Mountains. Steep, dangerous, but fast.
They climbed 10,000 feet in days.
**The Butcher Shop:**
At the summit, they killed 24 dogs as planned. They named the camp "The Butcher’s Shop." They feasted on dog cutlets.

**The Pole (Dec 14, 1911):**
"So we arrived and were able to plant our flag at the geographical South Pole."
No fanfare. Just business.
They pitched a tent (**Polheim**). Inside, Amundsen left letters.
*   One for King Haakon of Norway.
*   One for Scott: *"Dear Captain Scott... As you are probably the first to reach this area after us, I will ask you to kindly forward this letter to King Haakon. If you can use any of the articles left in the tent please do not hesitate to do so... Good Return."*
(This note was the ultimate psychological blow to Scott).

## The Return

The trip back was smooth.
They had so much food they threw chocolate away to lighten sleds.
**Arrival:** Jan 25, 1912.
Total distance: 1,860 miles in 99 days.
All men healthy. 11 dogs survived.

## Legacy

When news broke, the British press vilified Amundsen as a "sneak" who didn't "play the game." However, history has vindicated him as the superior explorer.
Amundsen later died in 1928, flying a rescue plane to find a stranded Italian explorer (Nobile) in the Arctic. His body was never found.

> "I may say that this is the greatest factor: the way in which the expedition is equipped, the way in which every difficulty is foreseen, and precautions taken for meeting or avoiding it. Victory awaits him who has everything in order."
