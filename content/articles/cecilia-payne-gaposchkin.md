## Summary

Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin was a British-American astronomer who discovered that stars are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, fundamentally changing our understanding of stellar composition. Her 1925 doctoral thesis has been described as 'the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy.' Despite initial dismissal of her findings by Henry Norris Russell, she was later vindicated. She became the first woman to become a full professor at Harvard.
