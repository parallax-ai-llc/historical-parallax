## Summary

On February 1, 2021, Myanmar's military (Tatmadaw) seized power in a coup, arresting State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and other civilian leaders. The military claimed fraud in the November 2020 election—won overwhelmingly by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD)—though independent observers found no evidence of systematic irregularities. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing became the country's ruler, ending Myanmar's decade-long experiment with hybrid civilian-military governance.[^1]

The coup triggered one of the largest civil disobedience movements in modern history. Millions of Myanmar citizens—healthcare workers, civil servants, bankers, teachers—refused to work for the junta. Non-violent protesters filled the streets for weeks. The military responded with escalating brutality: beatings, mass arrests, torture, and eventually live ammunition against unarmed demonstrators. By April 2021, massacres like the Bago assault (82+ killed) signaled the junta's willingness to use counterinsurgency tactics against its own people.[^2]

What began as protest evolved into civil war. The People's Defense Force (PDF) and allied ethnic armed organizations have waged armed resistance across the country. As of late 2024, over 6,000 civilians have been killed, 3+ million displaced, and much of the country is contested territory. Aung San Suu Kyi remains imprisoned on politically motivated charges. The resistance has made significant gains, controlling substantial territory, but the conflict continues with no resolution in sight.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Military Rule and Democratization

Myanmar (Burma) has been dominated by military rule since 1962:

- **1962:** General Ne Win's coup begins decades of isolation
- **1988:** 8888 Uprising crushed; SLORC junta takes power
- **1990:** NLD wins election; military ignores results
- **2010:** "Disciplined democracy" constitution; hybrid system
- **2015:** NLD wins election; Suu Kyi becomes de facto leader
- **2020:** NLD wins landslide; military prepares coup[^4]

### The Rohingya Crisis

In 2017, under Suu Kyi's government, the Tatmadaw conducted what the UN called genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine State. 700,000+ fled to Bangladesh; thousands were killed. Suu Kyi's defense of the military at the International Court of Justice damaged her global reputation but demonstrated the uneasy civil-military relationship—and the military's capacity for mass atrocities.[^5]

### The 2020 Election

On November 8, 2020:
- NLD won 396 of 476 contested seats
- Military-aligned USDP won only 33 seats
- Turnout: 72% despite COVID-19
- International observers certified election as credible

The military claimed massive fraud without evidence; election commission rejected claims. Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing's presidential ambitions appeared blocked.[^6]

## The Coup

### February 1, 2021

In the early morning hours, as the new parliament was about to convene:

- Military detained Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint, and NLD leaders
- State of emergency declared for one year
- All legislative, executive, and judicial power transferred to Min Aung Hlaing
- Communications disrupted; internet restricted
- Military cited constitutional authority and alleged election fraud[^7]

### Junta Leadership

The State Administration Council (SAC) was formed:

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| Min Aung Hlaing | SAC Chair; Commander-in-Chief |
| Soe Win | SAC Vice Chair; Deputy Commander |
| Military officers | Dominate all branches of government |

---

## The Resistance

### Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM)

Starting February 2, 2021, a massive CDM paralyzed the junta:

**Participants:**

- General population

**Impact:**
- Government functions severely impaired

### Street Protests

Millions joined protests:

**Tactics:**

- Red ribbons (NLD color)
- Night strikes; pot-banging protests
- Creative demonstrations (weddings, costumes)
- Decentralized organization[^9]

### The "Spring Revolution"

The protest movement adopted this name to signify:
- Generational change
- Democratic aspiration
- Connection to global democracy movements

---

## Armed Resistance

### Formation of PDF

As nonviolent protest was crushed, armed resistance emerged:

- **April 2021:** National Unity Government (NUG) formed by elected MPs
- **May 2021:** People's Defense Force (PDF) established as NUG's armed wing
- **September 7, 2021:** NUG declares "people's defensive war"

### Civil War

The conflict expanded rapidly:

**Resistance forces:**
- PDF (various local chapters)
- Ethnic Armed Organizations (EAOs)—Karen, Kachin, Chin, Rakhine, Shan forces
- Urban guerrilla cells

**Junta weaknesses:**
- Military stretched thin
- Defections
- Economic problems
- Loss of territory

**Resistance gains (2023-2024):**
- Operation 1027 (October 2023): Major offensive; significant territorial gains
- Military losing control of border areas
- Some major towns captured by resistance[^15]

## Historical Assessment

### Democracy Movement Perspective

**Continuing Revolution:** The 2021 uprising represents the continuation of Myanmar's democracy struggle from 1988. Despite horrific violence, civil resistance has not been extinguished but transformed into armed revolution. The younger generation—"Gen Z"—has shown remarkable courage and creativity.[^17]

**Federal Democracy Vision:** The NUG and resistance have articulated visions of a federal democratic Myanmar that addresses ethnic minority grievances historically ignored. This represents potential for genuine transformation beyond mere restoration of pre-coup status.[^18]

### Junta Perspective

**Official Justification:** The military claims it acted to preserve national sovereignty against electoral fraud and protect the 2008 constitution. It portrays resistance as "terrorists" backed by foreign powers.

### Critical Analysis

**Suu Kyi's Legacy:** Her failure to protect the Rohingya and work with the military raises questions about the pre-coup democratic transition. Yet her continued defiance in detention and the mass popular resistance she inspired demonstrate her enduring symbolic importance.[^19]

**International Failure:** The global community's inability to protect Myanmar's democracy or civilian population reflects failures of the international order. Sanctions have had limited effect; ASEAN's engagement has been ineffective.[^20]
