## Summary

Ogino Kyusaku was a Japanese gynecologist who discovered the relationship between menstruation and ovulation timing in 1924, establishing the Ogino method (rhythm method) of fertility awareness. His research determined that ovulation occurs 12-16 days before the next menstrual period. While intended for fertility treatment, it was also adopted as a birth control method.
