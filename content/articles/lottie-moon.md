Lottie Moon was an American Southern Baptist missionary who spent nearly 40 years in China. She is one of the most celebrated missionaries in Baptist history, and the annual Lottie Moon Christmas Offering for international missions bears her name. She advocated for women's equality in missions and challenged the Baptist mission board. She died of starvation-related illness during a famine, having given away her food and money.
