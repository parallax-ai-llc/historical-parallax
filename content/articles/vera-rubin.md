## Summary

Vera Rubin was an American astronomer who pioneered the discovery of galaxy rotation curves that provided strong evidence for dark matter. Her observations showed that galaxies rotate much faster than predicted by visible mass alone, implying the existence of unseen matter. Despite her groundbreaking contributions, she was never awarded the Nobel Prize. She was a champion for women in science and broke barriers throughout her career.
