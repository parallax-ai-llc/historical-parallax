## Summary

Samuel Morse was an American inventor and painter who co-developed the Morse code and contributed to the development of the electric telegraph. His 1844 message 'What hath God wrought' sent from Washington to Baltimore demonstrated the telegraph's potential for long-distance communication. Before his invention work, he was a respected portrait painter. The telegraph revolutionized communication and laid the groundwork for modern telecommunications.
