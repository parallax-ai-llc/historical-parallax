## Summary

Joseph Fourier was a French mathematician and physicist who is best known for the Fourier series and Fourier transform, mathematical tools that decompose functions into sums of sinusoidal functions. His work on heat conduction ('Théorie analytique de la chaleur') was groundbreaking. Fourier analysis has become essential in physics, engineering, signal processing, and countless other fields. He also studied the greenhouse effect.
