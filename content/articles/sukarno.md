## Summary

Sukarno (1901-1970) was Indonesia's first president and founding father, serving from 1945 to 1967. A charismatic orator and revolutionary nationalist, he led Indonesia's struggle for independence from Dutch colonial rule and declared the nation's independence alongside Mohammad Hatta on August 17, 1945.[^1][^2] He developed Pancasila as Indonesia's founding ideology and played a pivotal role in the Non-Aligned Movement, hosting the historic 1955 Bandung Conference.[^3][^4] His presidency ended in controversy following the 1965 coup attempt and subsequent anti-communist massacres, leading to his removal from power by General Suharto in 1967 and house arrest until his death.[^5][^6]

## Early Life and Background

Born Koesno Sosrodihardjo on June 6, 1901, in Surabaya, Java, Dutch East Indies, Sukarno came from a unique multicultural background that would profoundly shape his political philosophy.[^7] His father, Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo, was a Muslim Javanese primary school teacher from the priyayi class in Grobogan, Central Java, while his mother, Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai, was a Hindu Balinese woman from the Brahmin caste in Buleleng, Bali.[^8][^9] As the only son of a poor schoolteacher, Sukarno grew up in poverty and spent extended periods of his childhood with his grandparents in the village of Tulungagung, where he was exposed to the animism and mysticism of rural Java.[^10]

Following Javanese custom, he was renamed after surviving a childhood illness; the name Sukarno derives from Karna, the mythological chief hero of the Mahabharata.[^11] After graduating from a native primary school in 1912, he was sent to the Europeesche Lagere School, a Dutch primary school in Mojokerto.[^12] In 1916, at age 15, Sukarno attended a Hogere Burgerschool (Dutch-type higher-level secondary school) in Surabaya, where he boarded in the home of Omar Said Tjokroaminoto, a prominent civic and religious figure and founder of Sarekat Islam.[^13]

Tjokroaminoto treated the young Sukarno as a cherished foster son and protégé, financed his further education, and eventually married him off at age 20 to his own 16-year-old daughter, Siti Utari.[^14] This mentorship proved crucial to Sukarno's political development, exposing him to nationalist and Islamic thought. In 1921, Sukarno began studying civil engineering with a focus on architecture at the Technische Hoogeschool te Bandoeng (Bandoeng Institute of Technology), where he obtained an Ingenieur degree in 1926.[^15] During his education, he demonstrated remarkable linguistic abilities, mastering Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, modern Indonesian (which he helped create), Arabic, Dutch, German, French, English, and later Japanese.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Sukarno's political career began in earnest after completing his engineering education. On July 4, 1927, along with friends from the Algemeene Studieclub, he established the Indonesian National Party (PNI), a pro-independence party of which Sukarno was elected the first leader.[^17] The PNI advocated for complete independence from Dutch colonial rule and rapidly grew in influence. By 1929, the party had attracted 10,000 members, alarming Dutch colonial authorities who arrested Sukarno and three other PNI leaders on December 29.[^18]

In December 1930, Sukarno was sentenced to four years in prison and served time in Sukamiskin prison in Bandung, where he delivered his famous "Indonesia Accuses" defense speech in 1930.[^19] In this speech, he first used the term "Marhaens" to replace the term proletariat, naming it after a farmer he claimed to have met while cycling near Bandung, considering the Marxist term largely irrelevant to Indonesia's agricultural society.[^20][^21] His sentence was reduced, and he was released in December 1931. However, his freedom was short-lived; he was arrested again in August 1933 and exiled first to Flores, then to Bengkulu in southern Sumatra, where he would remain for more than eight years.[^22][^23]

During his exile in Bengkulu, Sukarno met and married Fatmawati, the 15-year-old daughter of Hassan Din, the local head of the Muhammadiyah organization, in 1943.[^24] The invading Japanese forces released Sukarno from exile in 1942, and he and fellow nationalists collaborated with the Japanese occupation, garnering support for the Japanese war effort from the population in exchange for Japanese aid in spreading nationalist ideas.[^25] On June 1, 1945, Sukarno delivered one of his most famous speeches, defining the Pancasila (Five Principles): nationalism, internationalism, democracy, social prosperity, and belief in God—principles that would become the foundational state doctrine of Indonesia.[^26][^27]

Upon Japanese surrender, activist youths kidnapped, intimidated, and persuaded Sukarno to declare Indonesian independence.[^28] On August 17, 1945, Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta proclaimed Indonesian independence, and Sukarno was appointed president.[^29][^30] He then led the Indonesian resistance to Dutch re-colonization efforts through diplomatic and military means during the Indonesian National Revolution until the Dutch finally recognized Indonesian independence in 1949.[^31]

## Major Achievements

### Pancasila and National Identity

Sukarno's most enduring intellectual contribution was the formulation of Pancasila, introduced during the joint session of the BPUPK (Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence) on June 1, 1945.[^32] Unlike most earlier nationalist leaders, Sukarno had a unique talent for synthesizing Javanese tradition (especially the lore of wayang theater with its depictions of the battle between good and evil), Islam, and his own version of Marxism to create a unifying national ideology.[^33] He modestly described himself regarding Pancasila: "I am only its formulator: a formulator of those feelings which have been present silently in the heart of the Indonesian people."[^34] For Sukarno, Pancasila was not merely theoretical but a practical political tool to manage Indonesia's extraordinary diversity and avert polarization among its citizens.[^35] The ideology continues to serve as the ideological backbone of the Indonesian state, invoked to promote unity, counter extremism, and guide policy, though its interpretation has evolved over time.[^36]

### Bandung Conference and Non-Aligned Movement

In April 1955, Indonesia hosted the Bandung Conference in the Indonesian city of Bandung, attended by 29 Asian and African countries representing 1.5 billion people—54% of the world's population.[^37][^38] Sukarno, as host and a major anti-imperialist figure, delivered a powerful opening address articulating anti-colonial principles, declaring: "colonialism is not yet dead. How can we say it is dead, so long as vast areas of Asia and Africa are unfree."[^39] Indonesian President Sukarno and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru were key organizers in their quest to build a nonaligned movement that would win the support of the newly emerging nations of Asia and Africa.[^40]

The conference's core principles included political self-determination, mutual respect for sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality.[^41] Participants condemned colonialism, racial discrimination, and segregation, expressed support for people fighting for independence, and advocated for economic and cultural cooperation among states.[^42] The meeting gave rise to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the concept of the Third World or the South.[^43][^44] In 1961, Sukarno joined with Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, India's Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia's President Josip Broz Tito, and Ghana's President Kwame Nkrumah to formally establish the Non-Aligned Movement.[^45]

### Guided Democracy

On July 5, 1959, Sukarno reinstated the 1945 constitution by presidential decree, establishing a presidential system which he believed would make it easier to implement the principles of "Guided Democracy."[^46] Claiming that Western-style parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Indonesia, he called for a system based on indigenous principles of governance.[^47] In March 1960, Sukarno dissolved the elected Assembly and replaced it with an appointed Assembly, effectively consolidating his power.[^48] The Nasakom ideology was Sukarno's attempt to create an Indonesian form of socialism mixing socialist and nationalist ideas adapted to Indonesia's unique situation as a nation of thousands of islands, many ethnic groups, and diverse religions.[^49]

Under Sukarno's leadership, Indonesia achieved impressive gains in health, education, and cultural self-awareness and self-expression, achieving what Sukarno most joyously sought and acclaimed as "national identity"—an exhilarating sense of pride in being Indonesian.[^50] By the early 1960s, Sukarno pursued an aggressive foreign policy and positioned Indonesia as a leading voice in the anti-imperialist Non-Aligned Movement.[^51]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Economic Mismanagement

Despite gains in cultural self-awareness, democracy and the economy foundered under Sukarno's leadership.[^52] His government was plagued by corruption, inflation soared, and the country experienced a continuous state of crisis.[^53] Hyperinflation ensued, with annual rates exceeding 100 percent from 1962 through 1965, driven by unchecked money printing to service debts from Sukarno's expansive foreign policy initiatives.[^54] Overall price increases surpassed 1,500 percent in the first half of the 1960s, eroding purchasing power and causing shortages of essentials like rice and fuel.[^55] Economic adventurism, resulting in the deliberate creation of economic chaos, was later identified as one of the "three deviations" that needed correction after Sukarno's era.[^56]

### Konfrontasi with Malaysia

From 1963 to 1966, Indonesia under President Sukarno engaged in armed confrontation with Malaysia, stemming from Indonesia's opposition to the creation of Malaysia from the Federation of Malaya.[^57] Sukarno saw the formation of Malaysia as a British strategy to contain Indonesia's geopolitical ambitions in the region.[^58] On January 20, 1963, the Indonesian Foreign Minister announced a policy of confrontation towards Malaya in economic and social relations.[^59] Sukarno launched a "Ganyang Malaysia" or "crush Malaysia" campaign, initially using political, economic, and propaganda means.[^60]

In 1964, all British companies operating in Indonesia, including Indonesian operations of the Chartered Bank and Unilever, were nationalized.[^61] There were two separate series of takeovers, one involving five British companies and another that eliminated all Malaysian companies.[^62] The Konfrontasi had severe economic impacts on Indonesia, exacerbating the already dire economic situation.[^63]

### The 1965 Coup and Mass Killings

On September 30, 1965, a group of left-wing soldiers calling themselves the September 30th Movement abducted six army generals and a first officer from their homes, resulting in the deaths of several generals, a lieutenant, and the five-year-old daughter of one general who escaped the kidnapping.[^64][^65] The movement aimed to throw the army high command off balance, discredit the generals as apparent enemies of Sukarno, and shift Indonesian politics to the left so that the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party) could come to power rapidly.[^66]

Sukarno's exact role in the coup remains controversial.[^67] Following the failed coup, mass killings began in October 1965 and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in early 1966.[^68] Between 500,000 and 1.5 million communists and alleged communists were slaughtered by paramilitary groups and the Indonesian army, and on top of that, one million people were imprisoned without charge or trial.[^69][^70] The Indonesian army directed the killings with varying degrees of assistance from religious groups and other enemies of the PKI, targeting members of the PKI and its affiliated organizations, military men sympathetic to the PKI, and Sukarno supporters.[^71]

Sukarno was aware of the anti-communist killings and condemned them; between October and December 1965, he called for the killings to end, but the army controlled the media and his speeches were no longer published in newspapers.[^72] Sukarno refused to blame the PKI for the coup or ban it as the Army demanded, and as the violence spread, he issued orders to try to stop it, but he was ignored.[^73][^74] Western powers, including the UK and Australia, encouraged the army to move forcefully against the Left, facilitated widespread violence including mass killings, and helped to consolidate the political power of the army through covert operations spreading false "black propaganda" to encourage hostility against the PKI.[^75][^76]

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Wives

Sukarno married eight women throughout his life: Siti Oetari, Inggit Garnasih, Fatmawati, Hartini, Kartini Manoppo, Naoko Nemoto (Ratna Sari Dewi), Haryati, and Yurike Sanger.[^77] Some wives he divorced, while others remained married to him until his death on June 21, 1970.[^78]

His first marriage was to Siti Oetari, the daughter of his mentor Tjokroaminoto, when Sukarno was 20 years old.[^79] He later married Inggit Garnasih, but their almost 20-year marriage produced no children.[^80] In 1943, he married Fatmawati, the 15-year-old daughter of Hassan Din, the local head of the Muhammadiyah organization in Bengkulu, justifying this new relationship by stating Inggit's inability to produce children.[^81] Fatmawati became the first lady of Indonesia from 1945 until 1967 and was the mother of Indonesia's first female president, Megawati Sukarnoputri.[^82]

The marriage faced challenges when Fatmawati objected to Sukarno taking Hartini as his new wife according to Muslim law in 1953.[^83] Fatmawati moved out of the presidential palace and lived separately in Jakarta, though as part of the settlement, she was allowed to keep the title of first lady.[^84]

### Dewi Sukarno

In 1959, 19-year-old Naoko Nemoto met the 58-year-old Sukarno at a Ginza hostess bar in Tokyo when she was an arts student and entertainer and Sukarno was on a state visit to Japan.[^85] Naoko married Sukarno in Indonesia in 1962 and converted to Islam.[^86] Sukarno gave her the Indonesian name "Ratna Sari Dewi Sukarno," derived from Javanese-Sanskrit meaning "the jewel essence of a goddess."[^87] They had one daughter, Kartika (born March 11, 1967), who was Sukarno's eighth child and now goes by the name Carina.[^88] Dewi was reportedly Sukarno's most beloved wife, as confirmed by Sukarno's will.[^89]

### Children and Family Legacy

Sukarno's most politically prominent child is Megawati Sukarnoputri, born January 23, 1947, to Sukarno and Fatmawati.[^90][^91] Megawati became Indonesia's first and only female president to date, serving from 2001 to 2004 and as vice president from 1999 to 2001.[^92][^93] She is the first and current leader of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), one of Indonesia's largest political parties.[^94] Through Megawati and her children—especially Puan Maharani, who currently serves as Speaker of Indonesia's People's Representative Council (DPR)—the Sukarno family continues to wield significant influence in Indonesian politics.[^95]

### Personality and Charisma

Sukarno possessed extraordinary charisma and was recognized as a writer, orator, and drafter.[^96] He had a mellifluous voice and the power to arouse people with his oratory.[^97] During his entire political career, his political charisma, displayed most prominently through his oratory, sought to create a unified and revolutionary nationalist society.[^98] One observer vividly described his public speaking abilities: "It is an illuminating experience to watch one of Sukarno's vast audiences under the spell of his oratorical powers, as he quite literally holds his audience in the palms of his hand."[^99]

## Legacy

Sukarno's legacy as the founding father of Indonesia and a symbol of national unity and independence continues to be widely respected by many Indonesians, often more so than that of Suharto.[^100] He is roundly considered Indonesia's founding father, revered as Bung Karno, the father of the nation, with his image appearing on currency, his speeches quoted in schools, and his birthday commemorated.[^101][^102] His leadership ushered in independence, shaped national identity, and laid the ideological foundation of the modern Indonesian state.[^103]

Pancasila continues to serve as the ideological backbone of the Indonesian state, invoked to promote unity, counter extremism, and guide policy, though its interpretation has evolved since Sukarno's time.[^104] The 1955 Bandung Conference he hosted remains a landmark in Third World solidarity and anti-colonialism, inspiring generations of leaders in the Global South.[^105] His vision of non-alignment and his role in establishing the Non-Aligned Movement positioned Indonesia as a significant player in international affairs during the Cold War era.[^106]

However, the historical evaluation of Sukarno's presidency remains complex and contradictory. While he was a charismatic leader known for his ability to unite diverse ethnic groups and political factions under a common national identity, and while Indonesia made gains in health, education, and cultural self-awareness under his leadership, democracy and the economy foundered, his government was corrupt, inflation soared, and the country experienced a continuous state of crisis.[^107][^108][^109] Sukarno's legacy is therefore complex; he is celebrated as a national hero but criticized for authoritarian governance and economic mismanagement.[^110]

His presidency ended dramatically when, stripped of his power in 1966, Sukarno resigned in 1967 and lived under house arrest until his death.[^111] He died on June 21, 1970, and was buried in Blitar, East Java, next to his mother.[^112] Despite the controversial end to his rule, his contribution to Indonesian independence and nation-building ensures his position as one of the most significant figures in Southeast Asian history.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many scholars and supporters view Sukarno as an indispensable architect of Indonesian independence and national identity. His formulation of Pancasila provided Indonesia with a unifying ideology that transcended the nation's extraordinary ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity, creating a framework that continues to guide Indonesian governance and national discourse.[^113] Historians credit Sukarno with transforming disparate colonial territories into a unified nation-state with a strong sense of identity and purpose.[^114]

His role in the international anti-colonial movement is widely praised. The 1955 Bandung Conference he hosted is recognized as a watershed moment in the history of decolonization and Third World solidarity, bringing together leaders from Asia and Africa to chart an independent course between the Cold War superpowers.[^115][^116] Scholars note that Sukarno's vision of non-alignment and his articulation of anti-imperialist principles inspired liberation movements and newly independent nations across the Global South.[^117]

Defenders of Sukarno's domestic policies point to the significant achievements in education, health, and cultural development during his tenure. The nation experienced what Sukarno himself described as the emergence of "national identity"—an exhilarating sense of pride in being Indonesian.[^118] His ability to synthesize diverse intellectual traditions, including Javanese mysticism, Islamic thought, and socialist principles, demonstrated remarkable philosophical creativity.[^119] His oratorical skills and charismatic leadership were instrumental in mobilizing mass support for independence and nation-building.[^120]

Regarding the 1965 coup and subsequent massacres, some historians note that Sukarno actively opposed the killings, calling for them to end between October and December 1965, though his speeches were suppressed by the army-controlled media.[^121] Supporters argue that he was increasingly marginalized and powerless to stop the violence, ultimately becoming a victim of military ambition and Western interference in Indonesian politics.[^122]

### Negative Views

Critics of Sukarno point to severe economic mismanagement that brought Indonesia to the brink of collapse. Under his leadership, inflation exceeded 100 percent annually from 1962 through 1965, with overall price increases surpassing 1,500 percent in the first half of the 1960s.[^123][^124] Essential commodities became scarce, and the government's economic adventurism through unchecked money printing and reckless foreign policy initiatives created deliberate economic chaos.[^125] Scholars argue that Sukarno prioritized political symbolism and international prestige over pragmatic economic development, leaving Indonesia impoverished despite its natural resources.[^126]

The authoritarian nature of his Guided Democracy system draws substantial criticism. In 1959, Sukarno dissolved the elected Assembly and replaced it with an appointed body, consolidating personal power and undermining democratic institutions.[^127][^128] Critics argue that his claim of adapting democracy to indigenous Indonesian values was merely a pretext for autocratic rule.[^129] The suppression of political opposition, restrictions on press freedom, and the cultivation of a personality cult are cited as evidence of authoritarian tendencies incompatible with genuine democracy.[^130]

Sukarno's foreign policy adventurism, particularly the Konfrontasi with Malaysia from 1963 to 1966, is viewed as a costly failure that drained national resources and isolated Indonesia internationally.[^131] The nationalization of British and Malaysian companies in 1964, while politically popular domestically, damaged foreign investment and economic development prospects.[^132] Critics argue that Sukarno's obsession with anti-imperialist posturing and regional dominance diverted attention and resources from urgent domestic needs.[^133]

Regarding the 1965 coup and massacres, critics note that while Sukarno may have personally opposed the killings, his refusal to ban the PKI as the Army demanded and his tolerance of communist influence created the conditions for the tragic events.[^134][^135] Some scholars argue that his political balancing act between the army and the PKI—the two pillars of his Guided Democracy—was inherently unstable and contributed to the crisis.[^136] The fact that between 500,000 and 1.5 million people were killed during his final years in power, regardless of his personal culpability, remains an indelible stain on his legacy.[^137]
