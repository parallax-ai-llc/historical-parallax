## Summary

Jean-Baptiste Lamarck was a French naturalist who is best known for his theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics. While this theory was later disproven by Mendelian genetics, Lamarck was one of the first to propose that organisms change over time through natural processes. He coined the terms 'biology' and 'invertebrate' and classified invertebrate animals.
