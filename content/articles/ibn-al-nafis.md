## Summary

Ibn al-Nafis discovered pulmonary circulation — the flow of blood from the heart to the lungs and back — 300 years before William Harvey. In his Commentary on Anatomy in Avicenna's Canon, he correctly described how blood passes from the right ventricle to the left ventricle via the lungs, overturning Galen's theory of invisible pores in the heart wall.
