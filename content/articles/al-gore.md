Al Gore served as the 45th Vice President of the United States under Bill Clinton. His name appeared in unsealed Epstein-related court documents, but only as a passing mention with no allegations of wrongdoing.

## Context of Mention

Gore's name appeared in court documents purely as a reference—someone mentioned in conversation or as an acquaintance. There are no allegations, accusations, or evidence of any misconduct or inappropriate behavior related to Epstein.

## Clarification

Gore's inclusion in document releases does not indicate:
- Criminal activity
- Sexual misconduct
- Close association with Epstein
- Attendance at any events or properties

His name appears to have been mentioned in passing, similar to many public figures who had no substantive connection to Epstein's crimes.
