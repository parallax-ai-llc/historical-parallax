## Summary

Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach was the last sole proprietor of the Krupp industrial empire. He was convicted at the Nuremberg trials for using slave labor during World War II but was pardoned and had his property restored. He rebuilt the Krupp empire in the post-war economic miracle. He converted the family firm to a public foundation in 1968, ending the Krupp dynasty's direct control.
