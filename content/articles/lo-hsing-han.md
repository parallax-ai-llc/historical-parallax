## Summary
Lo Hsing Han was a Burmese drug lord who was one of the largest opium and heroin producers in the Golden Triangle. He used his drug profits to become a legitimate businessman in Myanmar, building one of the country's largest conglomerates. He was described as the 'Godfather of Heroin.'

## Early Life
Born around 1935 in Kokang, northern Shan State, Burma (Myanmar). He was of ethnic Chinese origin. He gained control of a local militia and used his military position to enter the opium trade. [^1]

Lo Hsing Han became one of the most powerful opium warlords in the Golden Triangle during the 1960s and 1970s. He led the Ka Kwe Ye militia, ostensibly fighting communist insurgents but primarily involved in the opium trade. After being pardoned by the Myanmar military, he built the Asia World conglomerate, one of the country's largest companies. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Lo Hsing Han was arrested by the Thai government in 1973 and sentenced to death for drug trafficking. He was extradited to Burma in 1980 and pardoned by the military government.
