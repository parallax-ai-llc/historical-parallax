## Summary

Ferdinand Magellan (c. 1480-1521) was a Portuguese explorer who organized and led the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe (1519-1522), proving conclusively that Earth is round and that all oceans are connected. Sailing under the Spanish flag, Magellan navigated the treacherous strait at South America's southern tip (now bearing his name) and crossed the Pacific Ocean—revealing its immense size. Though Magellan himself was killed in the Philippines before completing the journey, his expedition under Juan Sebastián Elcano finished the voyage with just 18 survivors out of 270 original crew members. The expedition revolutionized European understanding of world geography.

- Served as page in Portuguese royal court

## The Expedition Proposal

### Spanish Sponsorship

**Idea:**
Western route to Spice Islands (Moluccas) would avoid Portuguese-controlled eastern routes.

**Treaty of Tordesillas (1494):**
Spain and Portugal had divided New World. Spice Islands' location disputed—if approached from west, might fall in Spanish sphere.

**1518:**
Magellan convinced Spanish King Charles I (future Holy Roman Emperor Charles V) to fund expedition.

### Fleet

**Five Ships:**
1. *Trinidad* (flagship)
2. *San Antonio*
3. *Concepción*
4. *Victoria*
5. *Santiago*

**Crew:** ~270 men (Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, others)

## The Voyage

### Atlantic Crossing (1519)

**Departure:** September 20, 1519, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain

**Brazil:** Stopped for resupply. Continued south along South American coast.

**Winter (1520):**
Anchored at Port San Julián (Patagonia). Mutiny by Spanish captains—Magellan executed and marooned ringleaders.

### Strait of Magellan (October-November 1520)

**Discovery:**
Found passage at 52° south latitude. Took 38 days to navigate the treacherous, winding strait.

**Tierra del Fuego:**
Named for fires of indigenous peoples visible on shore.

**Desertion:**
*San Antonio* deserted, returned to Spain with supplies.

### Pacific Ocean

**November 28, 1520:**
Emerged into vast ocean. Magellan named it "Mar Pacífico" (Pacific Sea) for its calm waters.

**99 Days Without Landfall:**
One of history's most terrible ocean crossings:
- Scurvy ravaged crew
- Starvation (ate sawdust, leather, rats)
- Only two small islands sighted (both barren)
- 19 men died

**Size Revealed:**
Pacific far larger than any European had imagined. Crossed ~12,000 miles.

### Philippines (March 1521)

**Landfall:**
Reached islands (later named Philippines for King Philip II).

**Indigenous Contact:**
Ally with Rajah Humabon of Cebu. Magellan converted locals to Christianity.

## Death at Mactan

### April 27, 1521

**Conflict:**
Lapu-Lapu, chieftain of Mactan, refused submission. Magellan led punitive expedition to support Humabon.

**Battle of Mactan:**
~60 Spanish soldiers attacked ~1,500 warriors. Magellan mortally wounded by bamboo spear and hacked to death in shallows.

**Age:** ~41

**Body:**
Never recovered. Lapu-Lapu refused ransom for remains.

### Aftermath

Cebuano allies turned on remaining Spanish (possibly due to Humabon's treachery). Several officers killed.

## Completion of Circumnavigation

### Juan Sebastián Elcano

**New Commander:**
Basque navigator took command of *Victoria*.

**Route:**
Continued to Moluccas (Spice Islands). Loaded cloves. *Victoria* sailed west, around Cape of Good Hope (avoiding Portuguese).

### Return (September 6, 1522)

**Seville:**
*Victoria* arrived. Only 18 men of original 270 survived.

**First Circumnavigation:**
3 years, ~42,000 miles. Proved Earth is round and navigable.

**Cargo Value:**
Spices carried covered expedition's entire cost.

## Legacy

### Geographic

- Proved Earth's circumference
- Revealed Pacific's size
- Strait of Magellan named for him
- Magellanic clouds (galaxies visible from southern hemisphere)

### Historical

- Changed European worldview
- Demonstrated global maritime trade possible
- Contributed to Spanish colonial empire

### Controversy

Who deserves credit? Magellan conceived and led expedition but died mid-voyage. Elcano completed it but was subordinate. Both commemorated.
