## Summary

Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521) was a Portuguese explorer who organized the first expedition to circumnavigate the globe (1519-1522), proving Earth is round and oceans are connected. Though Magellan himself was killed in the Philippines before completing the journey, his expedition under Juan Sebastián Elcano became the first to circle the world. The voyage discovered the Strait of Magellan (southern tip of South America) and crossed the Pacific Ocean, revealing its vast size. Magellan's achievement revolutionized European understanding of geography and demonstrated the feasibility of global maritime trade routes.
