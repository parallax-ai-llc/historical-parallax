## Summary

Junipero Serra was a Spanish Franciscan friar who founded a series of Catholic missions in California that became the foundation of many modern Californian cities. He established nine missions along the California coast, converting thousands of Native Americans to Christianity. He was canonized by Pope Francis in 2015, though his legacy is controversial due to the treatment of indigenous peoples in the mission system.
