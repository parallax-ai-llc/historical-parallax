## Summary

Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin was the first President of the Russian Federation, serving from 1991 to 1999, and a pivotal figure in the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Rising from humble beginnings in the Ural Mountains to become the leader of the world's largest country during one of its most tumultuous periods, Yeltsin embodied both the promise and chaos of post-communist Russia. He courageously stood atop a tank to defend democracy during the 1991 coup attempt, yet presided over economic collapse, rampant corruption, and devastating military campaigns. His legacy remains deeply contested: to some, he is the liberator who freed Russia from communist tyranny; to others, he is the architect of national humiliation and the oligarchic system that continues to shape Russia today.

## Early Life and Background

Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin was born on February 1, 1931, in the village of Butka in Sverdlovsk Oblast (now Yekaterinburg Oblast) in the Ural Mountains of Russia.[^1] He came from a peasant family that had suffered under Stalin's collectivization policies. His grandfather, Nikolai Yeltsin, was declared a kulak and deported, while his father, Nikolai Ignatievich Yeltsin, spent three years in a labor camp for criticizing the Soviet system.[^2] These early experiences with Stalinist repression would later inform his political evolution, though Yeltsin himself would join the Communist Party in 1961.[^3]

Yeltsin's childhood was marked by poverty and hardship. He grew up in communal barracks with his family, sharing a single room with goats and other livestock.[^4] Despite these difficult circumstances, young Boris was spirited and rebellious. At age 11, he led classmates in breaking into a weapons store, where he stole grenades to experiment with; the resulting explosion cost him the thumb and index finger of his left hand, an injury he would carry throughout his life.[^5] This incident exemplified the reckless courage and disregard for danger that would characterize his political career.

Academically gifted and athletic, Yeltsin excelled in school and was passionate about sports, particularly volleyball, which he played competitively throughout his youth.[^6] He studied civil engineering at the Ural Polytechnic Institute in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg), graduating in 1955.[^7] After graduation, he worked in the construction industry for nearly a decade, rising through the ranks from foreman to chief engineer, gaining practical experience that would serve him well in his later administrative roles.[^8] In 1961, Yeltsin joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), beginning his ascent through the party apparatus.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Yeltsin's political career began in earnest in 1968 when he became the head of the construction department of the Sverdlovsk regional party committee.[^10] His reputation as an energetic and effective administrator caught the attention of party leaders, and in 1976, at age 45, he was appointed First Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee, effectively making him the boss of the entire Sverdlovsk region.[^11] In this role, he demonstrated both reformist tendencies and authoritarian methods, demolishing the house where the Romanov family was murdered in 1918 to prevent it from becoming a pilgrimage site, while simultaneously showing concern for improving living standards for ordinary citizens.[^12]

Yeltsin's big break came in 1985 when Mikhail Gorbachev, newly appointed as General Secretary of the Communist Party, brought him to Moscow to serve as the head of the Construction Department of the Central Committee.[^13] Within months, Gorbachev promoted Yeltsin to First Secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee, essentially making him the mayor of the Soviet capital.[^14] Yeltsin quickly made a name for himself with his populist style, riding public transportation to work, making unannounced visits to shops and factories, and publicly firing incompetent officials.[^15] His theatrics and apparent concern for ordinary people made him enormously popular with the Moscow public, but his brash manner and criticism of the slow pace of reform alienated the party establishment.[^16]

The turning point came in October 1987 when Yeltsin gave a speech at a Central Committee plenum criticizing the slow pace of perestroika (restructuring) and obliquely attacking Gorbachev's close ally, Yegor Ligachev.[^17] Gorbachev, feeling betrayed, orchestrated Yeltsin's public humiliation and removal from his Moscow position.[^18] However, this political setback transformed Yeltsin into a martyr for reform. Rather than destroying him, the episode made him a symbol of resistance to the party establishment and boosted his popularity among reformers and the general public.[^19]

Yeltsin mounted his comeback by winning a seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies in March 1989 with a stunning 89% of the vote in a Moscow district.[^20] In May 1990, he was elected Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Russian SFSR), the largest republic in the USSR, effectively becoming the leader of Russia within the Soviet Union.[^21] On June 12, 1991, Yeltsin won Russia's first direct presidential election with 57% of the vote, giving him a democratic mandate that Gorbachev, who had never faced popular election, lacked.[^22] This dual legitimacy crisis—between Gorbachev's Soviet Union and Yeltsin's Russia—would come to a head in the dramatic events of August 1991.

## Major Achievements

Yeltsin's defining moment came during the August 1991 coup attempt by Soviet hardliners seeking to reverse Gorbachev's reforms.[^23] When tanks surrounded the Russian White House (the parliament building), Yeltsin famously climbed atop one and rallied resistance, calling on Russian citizens and soldiers to oppose the coup plotters.[^24] This iconic act of defiance, broadcast worldwide, cemented Yeltsin's image as a courageous democrat willing to risk his life for freedom.[^25] The coup collapsed within three days, but rather than strengthening Gorbachev, it fatally weakened the Soviet Union and elevated Yeltsin to the position of Russia's paramount leader.[^26]

In the aftermath of the failed coup, Yeltsin moved decisively to dismantle Soviet power structures. He banned the Communist Party in Russia, seized Soviet property and institutions within Russian territory, and worked with the leaders of Ukraine and Belarus to dissolve the Soviet Union itself.[^27] On December 8, 1991, the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met in the Belavezha Forest and signed an agreement declaring the Soviet Union dissolved and replacing it with a loose Commonwealth of Independent States.[^28] By December 25, 1991, Gorbachev resigned, the Soviet flag was lowered from the Kremlin for the last time, and the USSR ceased to exist.[^29] Yeltsin had achieved what no Western leader had managed during the entire Cold War: the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet empire.

As President of the newly independent Russian Federation, Yeltsin launched radical economic reforms designed to transition Russia from a centrally planned economy to a market-based system.[^30] On January 2, 1992, he liberalized most prices, ending seven decades of Soviet price controls.[^31] Working with young reformers like Yegor Gaidar and Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin implemented "shock therapy" economic policies including privatization of state enterprises, reduction of government subsidies, and opening Russia to foreign investment.[^32] The privatization program, while deeply flawed and conducive to corruption, transferred thousands of state enterprises to private ownership and created the legal foundations for a market economy.[^33]

Yeltsin also presided over significant political changes, including the adoption of a new Russian constitution in 1993 that established a semi-presidential system with strong executive powers.[^34] Despite the authoritarian tendencies this constitution enabled, it also guaranteed fundamental rights and freedoms unprecedented in Russian history, including freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and the right to private property.[^35] Under Yeltsin's presidency, Russia experienced its most open and pluralistic period, with independent media, competitive elections, and genuine political debate, even if these democratic gains were incomplete and fragile.[^36]

In foreign policy, Yeltsin sought to integrate Russia into Western institutions and build cooperative relationships with the United States and Europe.[^37] He withdrew Russian troops from Eastern Europe, signed major arms reduction treaties including START II, and joined the G7 (making it the G8) and the Council of Europe.[^38] He worked closely with U.S. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, establishing a generally cooperative if sometimes tense relationship between former Cold War adversaries.[^39] Yeltsin's Russia also allowed the former Soviet republics to become independent without military intervention (with the notable exception of Chechnya, which was not a separate republic but a region within Russia).[^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Yeltsin's presidency was marred by catastrophic economic failures that devastated the lives of millions of Russians. The "shock therapy" economic reforms, while intended to quickly transition to a market economy, instead produced hyperinflation that wiped out life savings, mass unemployment, collapsing living standards, and a dramatic decline in life expectancy.[^41] Between 1991 and 1994, Russia's GDP fell by approximately 40%, an economic contraction worse than the Great Depression in the United States.[^42] By 1999, an estimated 40% of Russians lived below the poverty line, compared to about 2% in Soviet times.[^43] The human cost was staggering: male life expectancy fell from 64 years in 1990 to 58 years in 1994, reflecting increased deaths from alcoholism, suicide, and cardiovascular disease linked to economic stress.[^44]

The privatization process, intended to create a property-owning democracy, instead concentrated wealth in the hands of a small group of politically connected oligarchs who acquired state assets at fire-sale prices through rigged auctions and insider deals.[^45] The "loans-for-shares" scheme of 1995-96, in which the government auctioned control of major state enterprises in exchange for loans, effectively transferred billions of dollars in state assets to a handful of businessmen including Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Boris Berezovsky, and Vladimir Potanin.[^46] This created an oligarchic system that dominated Russian politics and economics for decades, breeding massive public resentment and nostalgia for Soviet-era economic security.[^47]

Yeltsin's handling of the Chechen conflict represents perhaps his darkest legacy. When Chechnya declared independence in 1991, Yeltsin initially avoided military confrontation, but in December 1994, he launched a full-scale invasion to bring the breakaway republic back under Moscow's control.[^48] The First Chechen War (1994-1996) was a humanitarian catastrophe, killing an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 people, many of them civilians, and reducing the Chechen capital Grozny to rubble through indiscriminate bombing.[^49] The Russian military, demoralized and poorly equipped, suffered humiliating defeats at the hands of Chechen fighters.[^50] After two years of brutal warfare, Yeltsin agreed to a ceasefire that left Chechnya with de facto independence, making the entire war appear pointless and ensuring it would reignite under his successor.[^51]

Constitutional crisis and violent confrontation marked Yeltsin's relationship with the Russian parliament. In September 1993, facing a parliament dominated by communist and nationalist opponents who blocked his reforms and sought to curtail presidential powers, Yeltsin unconstitutionally dissolved the legislature.[^52] When parliamentary leaders refused to leave the White House and organized armed resistance, Yeltsin ordered tanks to shell the building on October 4, 1993, killing an estimated 123-150 people.[^53] While Yeltsin's supporters argued this was necessary to prevent a communist restoration, critics saw it as a coup against Russia's democratic institutions and a precedent for authoritarian rule.[^54] The new constitution Yeltsin pushed through in December 1993 concentrated enormous power in the presidency, creating what some scholars called "super-presidentialism" that would later enable Putin's authoritarian consolidation.[^55]

Yeltsin's personal behavior also drew severe criticism. His heavy drinking was an open secret that became an international embarrassment, including incidents where he appeared intoxicated at official functions, missed meetings with foreign leaders, or behaved erratically in public.[^56] His health problems, including multiple heart attacks, kept him hospitalized or incapacitated for extended periods, raising questions about who was actually running the country.[^57] His family, particularly his daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, wielded enormous influence and were accused of corruption and manipulating the ailing president.[^58] By his second term, Yeltsin was often absent or incoherent, while oligarchs, family members, and security officials competed for influence in what observers called "court politics."[^59]

---

## Personal Life

Boris Yeltsin married Naina Iosifovna Girina in 1956 while both were students at the Ural Polytechnic Institute.[^60] Naina, who worked as a water construction engineer before becoming a full-time political spouse, remained married to Yeltsin until his death and was known for her stabilizing influence and discretion.[^61] The couple had two daughters: Yelena (born 1957) and Tatyana (born 1960).[^62] Tatyana Dyachenko became particularly influential during her father's presidency, serving as his presidential image advisor from 1996 onwards and wielding significant power in the Kremlin, leading to accusations of nepotism and corruption.[^63]

Those who knew Yeltsin described a complex personality combining charm and brutality, populist instincts and authoritarian impulses, genuine emotional warmth and cold political calculation.[^64] He could be spontaneous and impulsive, making major decisions on instinct, sometimes with positive results (as in resisting the 1991 coup) and sometimes with catastrophic consequences (as in launching the Chechen war).[^65] Yeltsin was known for his volcanic temper and willingness to humiliate subordinates publicly, firing officials on live television or during public events.[^66] Yet he could also show unexpected magnanimity, such as when he declined to prosecute Gorbachev or the failed coup plotters, and when he granted immunity to himself and his family before resigning.[^67]

Yeltsin's alcoholism was a defining aspect of his personal life and presidency. While the extent of his drinking was subject to political manipulation and exaggeration by both Russian and Western media, there is no doubt that alcohol was a serious problem that affected his judgment and performance.[^68] His drinking contributed to his health problems, including multiple heart attacks in 1995 and 1996, and quintuple bypass surgery in November 1996.[^69] During his second term, he was frequently absent from public view for weeks or months at a time due to illness, raising constitutional questions about presidential succession and governance.[^70]

Despite his flaws, Yeltsin showed moments of genuine courage and moral clarity. His willingness to stand on a tank during the 1991 coup reflected real physical bravery.[^71] His decision to let the Soviet Union dissolve peacefully, rather than using force to maintain it as many in the military urged, prevented potential bloodshed on a massive scale.[^72] And in a remarkable moment of historical honesty, in 1998 Yeltsin presided over the burial of the remains of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, whom he himself had ordered demolished the house where they were murdered when he was Communist Party boss of Sverdlovsk, and he publicly apologized for the crime, calling it "one of the most shameful pages in our history."[^73]

## Legacy

Boris Yeltsin's legacy is perhaps the most contested of any post-Cold War leader, viewed through radically different lenses depending on one's political perspective and values. For his admirers, Yeltsin is the man who liberated Russia from communist totalitarianism, ended the Cold War peacefully, introduced democracy and market economics, and gave Russians freedom to speak, worship, travel, and own property for the first time in their history.[^74] The Boris Yeltsin Presidential Library and the Yeltsin Center museum in Yekaterinburg, which opened in 2015, present this heroic narrative of Yeltsin as Russia's great liberator.[^75]

For his critics, particularly in contemporary Russia where nostalgia for Soviet stability has grown, Yeltsin represents national humiliation, economic catastrophe, loss of great power status, and the corrupt oligarchic system that continues to plague Russia.[^76] Many Russians blame Yeltsin for the poverty, crime, and chaos of the 1990s, viewing this period as a "time of troubles" comparable to Russia's worst historical disasters.[^77] Vladimir Putin's rise to power was explicitly premised on reversing Yeltsin's perceived failures and restoring Russian strength and stability, even at the cost of the democratic freedoms Yeltsin had introduced.[^78]

Yeltsin's most enduring legacy may be his choice of successor. On December 31, 1999, in a surprise announcement, Yeltsin resigned six months before his term was due to expire, appointing Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president.[^79] Putin went on to win the March 2000 presidential election and has dominated Russian politics ever since, serving as president from 2000-2008, prime minister from 2008-2012, and again as president from 2012 to the present.[^80] While Yeltsin may have hoped Putin would continue his democratic and pro-Western orientation, Putin instead systematically dismantled many of Yeltsin's democratic reforms while maintaining his economic system and oligarchic structure.[^81] Whether Yeltsin bears responsibility for enabling Putin's authoritarianism remains a subject of intense debate.[^82]

Internationally, Yeltsin's legacy is somewhat more positive, particularly in the West. He is credited with ending the Soviet Union peacefully, withdrawing from Eastern Europe without bloodshed, reducing nuclear arsenals, and creating an opportunity—ultimately missed—for Russia to integrate into the Western democratic and economic order.[^83] Western leaders who worked with Yeltsin, including Bill Clinton, generally view him as a flawed but fundamentally well-intentioned partner who struggled against enormous odds to transform Russia.[^84] The contrast between Yeltsin's Russia, which was chaotic but open, and Putin's Russia, which is stable but increasingly authoritarian, makes many Western observers nostalgic for the Yeltsin era despite its problems.[^85]

Perhaps Yeltsin's most important legacy is that he proved Russia could change. After centuries of autocracy, 70 years of communist dictatorship, and deep cultural pessimism about Russia's capacity for democracy, Yeltsin showed that Russians would vote in competitive elections, support democratic movements, and defend freedom when given the chance.[^86] That this democratic experiment ultimately failed or was reversed does not erase the fact that it happened, and that millions of Russians experienced a taste of freedom that may someday be reclaimed.[^87]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic historians emphasize Yeltsin's role as a revolutionary democrat who made possible the most significant peaceful transition in modern history. Leon Aron, Yeltsin's American biographer, argues that Yeltsin's dissolution of the Soviet Union "may be the greatest bloodless revolution in history" and credits him with dismantling totalitarianism and establishing the foundations of Russian democracy and capitalism, however imperfect.[^88] According to this view, the chaos and corruption of the 1990s were inevitable consequences of the Soviet system's collapse and the difficulty of any transition from totalitarianism to democracy, not failures unique to Yeltsin personally.[^89]

Michael McFaul, a Russia scholar who later served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia, wrote that Yeltsin "gave Russians freedom" including "freedom of speech, freedom of travel, freedom of religion, and freedom to own property and make money," and that these achievements should not be forgotten despite the problems of his presidency.[^90] Yeltsin's defenders point out that he held and honored the results of competitive elections, allowed a free press even when it criticized him mercilessly, and voluntarily gave up power—all behaviors almost unprecedented in Russian history.[^91]

Some scholars argue that Yeltsin's economic reforms, while painful in the short term, created the foundations for Russia's economic recovery in the 2000s. Daniel Treisman, a political economist at UCLA, notes that by 2000, despite the 1998 financial crisis, Russia had "a functioning market economy, a private sector that accounted for 70 percent of GDP, an independent press, and competitive elections," providing the infrastructure for the Putin-era economic boom driven by oil prices.[^92] From this perspective, Yeltsin planted the seeds that later bore fruit, even if he did not live to see the harvest.

Western leaders who worked with Yeltsin tend to view him sympathetically. Bill Clinton wrote in his memoir that Yeltsin was "a brave patriot determined to build a new Russia on the ruins of the Soviet Union" and praised his courage in defending democracy during the 1991 coup.[^93] German Chancellor Helmut Kohl similarly praised Yeltsin for his role in allowing German reunification and withdrawing Soviet troops peacefully.[^94] These leaders acknowledge Yeltsin's flaws but emphasize his historic accomplishments and the difficult circumstances he faced.

Some Russian liberals and democrats continue to defend Yeltsin's legacy despite his unpopularity. Yegor Gaidar, Yeltsin's first prime minister and architect of shock therapy, argued before his death that Yeltsin saved Russia from totalitarianism and that the economic reforms, while painful, were necessary and ultimately successful in creating a market economy.[^95] Human rights activist Lyudmila Alexeyeva credited Yeltsin with creating the space for civil society to develop in Russia, even if that space later contracted under Putin.[^96]

### Negative Views

Critics on both the left and right condemn Yeltsin as a catastrophic leader whose presidency was characterized by corruption, incompetence, and national humiliation. Stephen Cohen, a prominent left-wing Russia scholar, called Yeltsin's presidency "a tragedy" that impoverished millions, created a kleptocratic system, and destroyed Russia's social infrastructure while enriching a tiny elite.[^97] Cohen and other critics argue that Yeltsin's economic "shock therapy" was ideologically driven, implemented without regard for social consequences, and represented a form of "market Bolshevism" that was just as dogmatic and destructive as communist central planning.[^98]

Russian communists and nationalists view Yeltsin as a traitor who destroyed a superpower and sold out Russian national interests to the West. Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Russian Communist Party, called Yeltsin "the destroyer of a great power" and blamed him for "the impoverishment of the people, the collapse of science and culture, and the loss of Russia's international prestige."[^99] This view resonates with many Russians who experienced the 1990s as a period of unprecedented national decline and see Yeltsin as personally responsible.[^100]

Many historians criticize Yeltsin's authoritarian tendencies and argue that his assault on parliament in 1993 and the super-presidential constitution he imposed created the framework for Putin's later authoritarianism. Masha Gessen, a journalist and Putin biographer, argues that "Yeltsin made Putin possible" by creating an overly powerful presidency, tolerating corruption, and failing to build strong democratic institutions.[^101] Political scientist Michael McFaul, despite his generally positive view of Yeltsin, acknowledges that "Yeltsin's commitment to democracy was selective" and that his concentration of power in the presidency weakened Russia's democratic development.[^102]

Scholars of the Chechen conflict condemn Yeltsin for launching an unnecessary and brutal war that killed tens of thousands and failed to achieve its objectives. Anna Politkovskaya, the Russian journalist murdered in 2006, documented atrocities committed by Russian forces in Chechnya and held Yeltsin personally responsible for initiating the conflict.[^103] Human rights organizations condemned the widespread violations of international humanitarian law during the First Chechen War, including indiscriminate bombing of civilians, torture, and extrajudicial executions.[^104]

Many Russians simply view Yeltsin as a weak and ineffective leader who was manipulated by his family, oligarchs, and advisors while he drank and suffered from ill health. Opinion polls consistently show Yeltsin ranking poorly among Russian leaders, with only about 15% of Russians viewing his presidency positively by the 2010s.[^105] This popular assessment, while perhaps unfair in some respects, reflects the lived experience of millions of Russians who suffered economically during the 1990s and associate that suffering with Yeltsin's leadership.[^106]
