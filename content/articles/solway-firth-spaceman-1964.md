## Summary

On a sunny day in 1964, fireman **Jim Templeton** took a photo of his 5-year-old daughter in a meadow. When developed, the photo clearly showed a tall figure in a white spacesuit standing behind her.

Templeton insisted they were alone. Kodak analyzed the negative and confirmed it was not tampered with. The case became stranger when Templeton reported being visited by **"Men in Black"** (who drove a Jaguar and referred to each other by numbers) and when technicians from a nearby missile range (Blue Streak) claimed the same figure aborted a launch that day.[^1]

## The Photo

### The Analysis
*   **The Figure:** Looks like a modern astronaut: white helmet, dark visor, white suit.
*   **Skeptics:** Argue it is Templeton's wife, Annie, walking away from the camera, overexposed so her blue dress looks white. The "helmet" is her dark hair.
*   **Counter-point:** Templeton swore his wife was not in the frame, and the Kodak labs found no evidence of a double exposure.

## The High Strangeness

### Men in Black (MIB)
Weeks later, two men in dark suits visited Templeton. They refused to show ID, used code names ("Number 9"), and demanded he take them to the site. When Templeton refused to admit it was a fake, they got angry and left him on the road.

### The Blue Streak Connection
The Woomera Missile Range in Australia (using British Blue Streak technology) reportedly aborted a launch on the same day because "two white spacemen" were seen on the firing range cameras.
