## Overview

On a sunny day in 1964, Jim Templeton, a firefighter from Carlisle, took three photos of his 5-year-old daughter Elizabeth sitting on the grass at Burgh Marsh.
He didn't see anyone else around.
When he got the Kodak film developed, the chemist said: *"Who's the astronaut in the background?"*
The photo clearly showed a tall, white-suited figure with a helmet/visor looming behind the girl.

## The Media Circus

The photo went viral worldwide.
Kodak offered a reward to anyone who could prove the photo was faked. No one could. It wasn't a double exposure.
**Men in Black:**
Templeton claimed that shortly after the photo was published, he was visited by two men in dark suits driving a dark Jaguar who demanded to know "where the larger bird was" and referred to each other by numbers (Number 9 and Number 11). When he refused to cooperate, they drove off angrily.

## The Woomera Connection

Days later, a Blue Streak missile launch at the Woomera Test Range in Australia was aborted because two "white figures" were seen on the firing range cameras.
Technicians claimed the figures looked exactly like the Solway Spaceman.
This added to the mystery: Was there a connection between the spaceman and missile technology?

## The Likely Explanation

Years later, analysts used modern image processing.
The "Spaceman" is almost certainly **Templeton's wife, Annie**.
- She was present that day.
- She was wearing a pale blue dress (which looks white in the overexposed photo).
- She had dark bobbed hair (which looks like a helmet visor).
- She was walking away from the camera, with her back turned.
Templeton likely just didn't notice her in the viewfinder (blind spot) or the frame was wider than he thought.
Despite the debunking, it remains one of the most iconic "fortean" images of the 20th century.
