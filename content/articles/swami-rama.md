## Summary

Swami Rama was an Indian yogi and founder of the Himalayan Institute who demonstrated extraordinary control over bodily functions in scientific laboratory settings. In 1970, he was studied at the Menninger Foundation where he demonstrated the ability to voluntarily control his heart rate, brain waves, and body temperature. He wrote over 40 books on yoga, meditation, and philosophy. His legacy has been complicated by allegations of sexual misconduct.
