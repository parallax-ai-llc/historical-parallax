## Summary

Sukjong (born October 7, 1661; died July 12, 1720) was the 19th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1674 to 1720.[^1] A master politician, Sukjong is famous for strengthening royal authority by manipulating the fierce factional struggles between the **Westerners** (Seoin) and **Southerners** (Namin) through a series of "political turnovers" called **Hwanguk**. His reign is equally famous for his dramatic personal life involving **Queen Inhyeon** and the femme fatale **Jang Hui-bin**, a saga of love, betrayal, and poison that has been dramatized countless times in Korean media. Despite the palace drama, he was a capable administrator who implemented the **Daedongbeop** tax reform nationwide and minted the **Sangpyeong Tongbo** currency.[^2]

## The Master of Hwanguk (Turnover Politics)

Sukjong ascended the throne at age 13 but ruled with terrifying authority. He initiated **Hwanguk** (change of state), where he would abruptly dismiss the ruling faction and replace them with the opposition to prevent any single group from becoming too powerful.
*   **Gyeongsin Hwanguk (1680):** Purged the Southerners (Namin) and brought the Westerners (Seoin) to power.
*   **Gisa Hwanguk (1689):** Expelled the Westerners and deposed Queen Inhyeon to make **Jang Hui-bin** queen, bringing the Southerners back.[^3]
*   **Gapsul Hwanguk (1694):** Regretting his decision, he purged the Southerners again, reinstated Queen Inhyeon, and demoted Jang Hui-bin.[^4]

## The Women of Sukjong

### Queen Inhyeon
The virtuous and patient queen who was deposed, exiled, and later reinstated. She died young in 1701, allegedly cursed by Jang Hui-bin.

### Jang Hui-bin (Lady Jang)
One of the most famous women in Korean history. A middle-class beauty who captivated the king, gave birth to the first son (Gyeongjong), and became the first commoner to become Queen.
*   **The End:** After Queen Inhyeon's death in 1701, it was discovered that Jang had built a shamanistic shrine in her quarters to curse the Queen. Sukjong, despite the pleas of the Soron faction, ordered her to commit suicide by poison (Sayak). He then passed a law forbidding concubines from becoming queen.[^5]

### Consort Suk (Choe Suk-bin)
A water-maid (lowest rank) who caught the king's eye. She was a supporter of Queen Inhyeon and the mother of **Prince Yeoning** (King Yeongjo).

## Achievements

Beyond the palace intrigues, Sukjong's 46-year reign was a time of economic stabilization.
*   **Daedongbeop (Uniform Land Tax Law):** He completed the nationwide implementation of this law (started 100 years prior), which allowed taxes to be paid in rice or cash instead of specialty local products, greatly reducing the burden on peasants.[^6]
*   **Currency:** In 1678, he standardized the **Sangpyeong Tongbo** coin, establishing a monetary economy in Joseon for the first time.[^7]
*   **Border Defense:** He established the **Baekdusan Jeonggyebi** (border monument) with Qing China in 1712, defining the northern border.[^8]
