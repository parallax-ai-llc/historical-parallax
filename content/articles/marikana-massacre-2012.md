## Summary

The Marikana massacre of August 16, 2012, was the single deadliest use of force by South African security services against civilians since the end of apartheid—and the worst such event since the 1976 Soweto Uprising. On that day, South African Police Service (SAPS) officers opened fire on striking platinum miners at the Lonmin mine near Rustenburg, killing 34 workers. Including deaths in the preceding days of the strike, 44 people died during the labor dispute.[^1]

The miners, many of them migrant workers living in desperate conditions, were demanding a wage increase from approximately R4,000 to R12,500 per month. Their strike emerged from frustration with both their employer and the established National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which many felt had become too close to management. The insurgent Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU) channeled their militancy.[^2]

The massacre shocked South Africa and the world. Television footage showed police opening fire on workers armed with machetes and sticks—many shot in the back as they fled or at close range. Initial attempts to charge survivors with murder under apartheid-era laws provoked outrage. The subsequent Farlam Commission criticized police planning and Lonmin's failures but resulted in no criminal prosecutions. More than a decade later, no one has been held accountable, making Marikana a symbol of impunity and the unfulfilled promises of post-apartheid South Africa.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Post-Apartheid South Africa

When the African National Congress (ANC) came to power in 1994, many hoped for fundamental economic transformation. Instead:

- Wealth inequality remained among world's highest
- Black workers remained largely in manual labor
- Mining sector continued apartheid-era patterns
- Migrant worker system persisted
- ANC government increasingly aligned with business interests[^4]

### The Platinum Belt

The Rustenburg platinum belt in North West Province:

- Produces approximately 80% of world's platinum
- Lonmin was third-largest platinum producer
- Thousands of workers—many from Eastern Cape—lived in informal settlements
- Dangerous work; inadequate housing; low wages
- Growing resentment at conditions[^5]

### Union Rivalry: NUM vs. AMCU

**National Union of Mineworkers (NUM):**

- Historically the main mining union
- Closely allied with ANC and COSATU federation
- Criticized for becoming bureaucratic and too close to management

**Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU):**

- Breakaway union; more militant
- Gained support among frustrated workers
- Rejected establishment politics

This rivalry created volatile conditions at Marikana.[^6]

## The Strike

### Origins (August 2012)

In early August 2012, rock drill operators (RDOs) at Lonmin's Marikana mine began an unprotected ("wildcat") strike:

**Demands:**

- Increase basic wage from approximately R4,000 (~$500) to R12,500 (~$1,500) per month
- Improved living conditions
- Recognition of AMCU

**Note:** The strike was not officially sanctioned by either union, reflecting workers' frustration with established channels.[^7]

### Escalating Violence (August 10-15)

The week before the massacre saw escalating confrontations:

- **August 10:** Strikers dispersed by rubber bullets
- **August 11:** Two Lonmin security guards killed
- **August 12:** Two police officers hacked to death; two strikers shot dead
- **August 13:** NUM shop steward killed

By August 15, ten people were already dead. Strikers gathered on a rocky hill (the "koppie") near the mine, armed with traditional weapons (pangas, knobkerries, sticks) and a small number of pistols taken from killed security guards.[^8]

### August 16: The Massacre

On August 16, police deployed in force around the koppie:

**Police Action:**

- Armored vehicles, water cannons, barbed wire
- Approximately 4,000 police officers
- Officers carried R5 assault rifles

**What Happened:**

- Police attempted to disperse and disarm strikers
- Tear gas and stun grenades fired
- A portion of strikers moved toward a gap in the barbed wire
- Police opened fire with automatic weapons
- In approximately 12 seconds, 17 workers were killed at "Scene 1"

**Scene 2:**

- A second group of miners fled toward a small kraal (enclosure)
- Police pursued and fired
- 17 more workers killed—many shot at close range or in the back
- Evidence suggested some were "hunted down"[^9]

## Death Toll and Casualties

**August 16, 2012:**

- 34 workers killed by police
- 78 injured (many seriously)

**Total during strike (August 10-16):**

- 44 people killed including:
  - 34 miners (August 16)
  - 2 police officers (killed by strikers)
  - 2 security guards
  - 6 miners (in earlier incidents)

**Arrests:**

- 270 miners arrested; initially charged with murder of their colleagues (charges dropped after outcry)[^10]

## The Farlam Commission

Following the massacre, President Jacob Zuma established a Commission of Inquiry chaired by Justice Ian Farlam:

**Duration:** October 2012 - June 2015

**Findings:**

- Criticized SAPS for inadequate planning and tactical errors
- Found police's claim of self-defense contained "material inconsistencies"
- Criticized Lonmin for failure to address housing and worker conditions
- Found both NUM and AMCU failed to control their members
- Criticized Cyril Ramaphosa's communications with police but stopped short of blaming him directly

**Recommendations:**

- Possible prosecutions of police officers
- Further investigation of specific incidents

**Outcome:**

- No criminal prosecutions resulted
- IPID (Independent Police Investigative Directorate) investigations remained incomplete
- Impunity persisted[^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Workers' Perspective

**Structural Violence:** Marikana exposed the continuity of exploitation from apartheid through post-apartheid South Africa. Migrant workers in platinum mines faced poverty wages, dangerous work, and squalid living conditions—within sight of enormous corporate profits.[^12]

**Betrayal:** Many workers felt betrayed by the ANC government they had fought to bring to power, and by unions that had become part of the establishment rather than defenders of worker interests.[^13]

### Government/Police Perspective

**Official Justification:** Police claimed they acted in self-defense against armed strikers who charged at them. The strike was "unprotected" (illegal), and violence had already claimed lives before August 16.

**Ramaphosa's Defense:** Cyril Ramaphosa, then on Lonmin's board, defended his emails calling for "concomitant action" against strikers, saying he never intended violence. He later apologized for insensitivity of language.[^14]

### Critical Analysis

**Collusion:** Investigators and journalists documented extensive collaboration between Lonmin and police in the days before August 16. Lonmin provided a helicopter, vehicles, and allegedly pressed for decisive action to end the strike.[^15]

**Impunity:** The absence of any prosecutions—despite clear evidence of excessive force—demonstrates the power of corporate and state interests over worker lives. Marikana became a symbol of institutional failure.[^16]

## Legacy

### Labor Relations

- AMCU displaced NUM as dominant union at platinum mines
- Wage strikes spread across mining sector
- Some wage increases achieved, though not R12,500 demand
- Labor militancy continued

### Political Impact

- Damaged ANC's reputation among working class
- Contributed to growth of opposition parties (EFF, especially)
- Ramaphosa's role became liability when he became ANC leader and president
- 2019: Ramaphosa apologized again on Marikana anniversary

### Commemoration

- August 16 marked annually at Marikana
- Memorial at the koppie
- Families continue to seek justice
- Civil society groups maintain pressure for accountability[^17]

### Compensation

- Some families received compensation from Lonmin/Sibanye-Stillwater
- Government provided limited ex gratia payments
- Workers' widows often remain in poverty
- Full justice remains elusive[^18]
