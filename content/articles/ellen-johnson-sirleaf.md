## Summary

Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (born 1938) served as President of Liberia from 2006 to 2018, becoming the first elected female head of state in Africa. Known as the "Iron Lady of Africa," she led Liberia through post-civil war reconstruction, working to rebuild infrastructure, attract foreign investment, and promote women's rights. A Harvard-trained economist who survived imprisonment and exile under dictators, Sirleaf was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2011 (shared with Leymah Gbowee and Tawakkol Karman) "for their non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights." Her presidency represented hope for democracy and women's leadership in Africa.
