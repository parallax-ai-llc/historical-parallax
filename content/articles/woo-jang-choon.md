## Summary

Woo Jang-choon (U Nagaharu) was a Korean-Japanese botanist and geneticist who proposed the Triangle of U theory explaining the genetic relationship among Brassica species. His theory demonstrated how three ancestral species hybridized to create three additional species, providing a foundational framework for understanding plant evolution and crop breeding. He later returned to South Korea to advance agricultural science.
