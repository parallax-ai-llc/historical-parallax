## Overview

In the summer of 2011, a splinter group of Anonymous called **LulzSec** (Lulz Security) went on a 50-day hacking rampage.
Their motto: *"Laughing at your security since 2011."*
They didn't hack for money (mostly). They hacked for "the lulz" (entertainment).
**Sony Hack:**
Their biggest hit. They breached the PlayStation Network, exposing personal data of 77 million users. Sony had to shut the network down for 24 days, costing $171 million.

- **Infragard:** Hacked an FBI-affiliated security firm.

## The Betrayal

The leader of the group, **Sabu** (Hector Monsegur), was a father of two living in public housing in New York.
The FBI caught him. He turned informant.
For months, the leader of LulzSec was secretly working for the FBI, gathering evidence on his friends (Topiary, Kayla, Tflow).
In 2012, they were all arrested in a coordinated global raid.
