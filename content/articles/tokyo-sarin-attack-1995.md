## Overview

The Tokyo subway sarin attack occurred on March 20, 1995, when members of the doomsday cult Aum Shinrikyo released sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo Metro during rush hour. It was the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in Japanese history and the first major use of chemical weapons by a non-state actor against civilians. Thirteen people died (one more died years later from complications), and thousands were injured, many suffering permanent eye or brain damage. The attack revealed the terrifying potential of WMD terrorism and exposed the dark side of a cult that had operated with near impunity.

## Background

### Aum Shinrikyo

**Shoko Asahara:**
Blind yoga teacher turned guru. Founded Aum in 1984.
Blend of Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity, and Nostradamus prophecies.

**Beliefs:**
- Impending Armageddon (nuclear war)
- Only Aum followers would survive
- "Poa": Killing someone to save them from accumulating bad karma (justification for murder)

**Membership:**
Attracted young, educated elite (scientists, doctors, lawyers). "High-IQ cult."

**Weaponization:**
Cult stockpiled weapons, biological agents (anthrax), and chemical weapons (sarin, VX) at secret compound near Mt. Fuji.
Already committed smaller sarin attack in Matsumoto (1994, 8 dead)—police failed to link it to Aum initially.

## The Attack (March 20, 1995)

### The Motivation

Police were planning massive raid on Aum headquarters on March 22. Asahara ordered subway attack to distract police and fulfill apocalyptic prophecy.

### The Method

**Liquid Sarin:**
Sarin is liquid (vaporizes). Placed in plastic bags wrapped in newspaper.

**Delivery:**
5 teams (2 men each: one planter, one getaway driver).
Planters boarded varied subway lines converging on **Kasumigaseki Station** (government district, police HQ).
Poked bags with sharpened umbrella tips, then exited train.

### The Lines

1. **Chiyoda Line:** 2 killed
2. **Marunouchi Line (Ogikubo bound):** 1 killed
3. **Marunouchi Line (Ikebukuro bound):** 0 killed (bag poorly punctured)
4. **Hibiya Line (Naka-Meguro bound):** 8 killed (deadliest)
5. **Hibiya Line (Kita-Senju bound):** 1 killed

### The Scene

**8:00 AM Rush Hour:**
Commuters noticed smell ("paint thinner"). began coughing, eyes dimming (miosis), vomiting, collapsing.
Subway staff tried to remove bags (often dying themselves).
Panic spread. Trains stopped. Passengers stumbled onto platforms.

---

## Casualties

**Deaths:** 14 (13 immediate/shortly after, 1 years later)
**Injuries:** ~1,000 with measurable symptoms. 5,000+ went to hospitals ("worried well").

**Sarin Effects:**
- Miosis (pupils constrict to pinpoints, vision darkens)
- Convulsions
- Foam at mouth
- Suffocation

---

## Investigation

### Police Raid

March 22 (scheduled raid happened anyway).
Found massive chemical factory. Enough sarin to kill millions (theoretically).
Also found helicopter, automatic rifles, LSD factory.

### Shoko Asahara Arrest (May 16)

Found hiding in a secret room between walls at cult HQ.

---

## The Trials

**Process:**
Dragged on for years.

**Executions (July 2018):**
Shoko Asahara and 12 senior cult members hanged.

---

## Legacy

### Psychological Impact

Shattered Japan's sense of safety ("Safe Japan").
Changed perception of religion (suspicion of new religions).

### Chemical Terrorism

Wake-up call for world. Proved terrorists *could* make and use WMDs.

### Victims

Survivors still suffer:
- PTSD
- Vision problems
- Fatigue

### Haruki Murakami

Wrote *Underground* (interviews with victims) to process national trauma.
