## Summary

Lin Rong-San (林榮三, May 27, 1939 – November 28, 2015) was a prominent Taiwanese publisher, businessman, politician, and real estate developer who founded the Liberty Times Group and Union Bank of Taiwan. Rising from humble beginnings as the son of a rice merchant in Luzhou, he built a business empire worth $4.2 billion spanning real estate, banking, and media. As founder of Taiwan's largest-circulation newspaper, the Liberty Times, and its English-language counterpart, the Taipei Times, Lin became one of the most influential voices for Taiwanese democracy and identity under the motto "Taiwan Foremost, Liberty First." His political career included serving as a legislator and Vice President of the Control Yuan, though he faced controversies over electoral fraud allegations and real estate speculation tactics.

## Early Life and Background

Lin Rong-San was born on May 27, 1939, in Luzhou District (鷺洲莊水湳, now part of New Taipei City's Luzhou District) during the Japanese colonial period of Taiwan. His father, Lin Chien-sheng (林建生), was a rice merchant and small-scale farmer, while his mother was Cheng Cha-mou (鄭查某, 1904-1979). Lin grew up in a large family with five older sisters (Lin Shuo, Lin Hao, Lin Tsu, Lin Man, and Lin Chin) and two older brothers, Lin Yu-chi (林堉琪) and Lin Yu-lin (林堉璘), who would later become billionaire real estate developers in their own right.[^1][^2]

The Lin family came from modest circumstances in the Luzhou area of what was then Taihoku Prefecture. As the youngest of eight children, Lin Rong-San experienced the hardships of post-war Taiwan firsthand. His father passed away when he was only 14 years old, forcing the young Lin to mature quickly and take on family responsibilities. The family's rice business, Yuyu Rice Mill (玉裕碾米廠), provided their livelihood during these difficult years.[^3][^4]

In 1964, Lin Rong-San graduated from the commercial division of Kainan Commercial and Industrial School (開南商工學校高商部). After graduation, he took over management of the family's rice mill business, continuing the work his father had started. However, the Lin family's fortunes would soon shift dramatically as they recognized the opportunities in Taiwan's burgeoning real estate market. The family's experience selling rice and managing agricultural commodities gave them their first taste of commerce and capital accumulation, which they would leverage into one of Taiwan's most successful real estate dynasties.[^5][^6]

The three Lin brothers—Yu-chi, Yu-lin, and Rong-San—would eventually form what became known as the "Sanchong Gang" (三重幫), named after the Sanchong district of New Taipei City, a powerful business group that would dominate Taiwan's real estate and financial sectors for decades. This family background in commerce, combined with the post-war economic boom in Taiwan, set the stage for Lin Rong-San's extraordinary rise from rice merchant's son to billionaire media mogul and political powerbroker.[^7][^8]

---

## Rise to Power

Lin Rong-San's ascent to prominence began in the mid-1960s when he and his two older brothers recognized the enormous potential in Taiwan's developing real estate market. In 1964, the three brothers jointly established Hung Kuo Construction (宏國建設), marking their entry into the construction and development industry. This collaborative venture allowed them to pool resources and expertise, though each brother would eventually pursue independent business empires.[^9][^10]

In 1967, Lin Rong-San made a pivotal decision that would define his business trajectory. He sold the family's rice mill, using the capital to begin purchasing land in the Sanchong area. This strategic move coincided with Taiwan's rapid industrialization and urbanization, as rural populations migrated to cities and demand for housing and commercial properties soared. Lin demonstrated an exceptional eye for land acquisition, focusing on areas that would appreciate dramatically as Taipei expanded.[^11][^12]

By 1971, Lin had accumulated sufficient capital and experience to establish Federal Construction (聯邦建設), which would become the cornerstone of his business empire, the Federal Group (聯邦集團). Following the death of his eldest brother Lin Yu-chi in 1978, the three brothers formally divided their business interests. Lin Yu-chi's family retained control of Hung Kuo Group, Lin Yu-lin founded Hung Tai Group (宏泰集團), and Lin Rong-San developed Federal Group into a diversified conglomerate spanning real estate, finance, and media.[^13][^14]

Lin's entry into politics came in 1975, when he ran as an independent candidate for the Legislative Yuan, representing Taiwan Province's first district (covering Taipei County, Keelung City, and Yilan County). With the introduction of Shao En-hsin, a major Sanchong political figure who was then Taipei County Magistrate, and encouragement from his brother Lin Yu-chi, Lin won a controversial election with 160,000 votes, defeating Tangwai (opposition movement) candidate Kuo Yu-hsin. After the election, Kuo hired prominent opposition lawyers Lin Yi-hsiung and Yao Chia-wen to sue Lin for electoral fraud, marking the first of several controversies that would follow Lin throughout his career. In 1977, Lin joined the Kuomintang (KMT).[^15][^16]

Lin's political ascent continued in 1980 when he was elected as a Control Yuan member by the Taiwan Provincial Assembly. By 1983, he had become a member of the KMT's Control Yuan party committee. His political influence peaked in February 1992 when he won an internal KMT election to become Vice President of the Control Yuan with a vote of 13 to 9. However, Lin stepped down from this position in 1993 to focus on his media ventures, subsequently being appointed as a Presidential Adviser by then-President Lee Teng-hui.[^17][^18]

The year 1980 also marked Lin's transformative entry into the media industry. On April 17, 1980, his Federal Group purchased the struggling Self-Strengthening Daily (自強日報) for NT$40 million. On January 1, 1981, the newspaper was renamed Liberty Daily (自由日報), positioning it as a regional newspaper serving central Taiwan. Lin's timing proved impeccable—when President Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988 and his successor Lee Teng-hui lifted press restrictions, Lin seized the opportunity to transform the Liberty Times from a local Taichung-based publication into a national powerhouse.[^19][^20]

---

## Major Achievements

Lin Rong-San's most enduring achievement was building the Liberty Times into Taiwan's largest-circulation newspaper and establishing it as the most influential voice for Taiwanese identity and democratic values. After acquiring the newspaper in 1980, Lin invested heavily in expanding coverage, hiring talented journalists, and developing a distinct editorial voice. When press restrictions were lifted in 1988, he launched the newspaper's defining motto: "Taiwan Foremost, Liberty First" (臺灣優先，自由第一). This philosophy resonated deeply with Taiwan's emerging democratic consciousness and growing sense of distinct national identity.[^21][^22]

The Liberty Times' circulation grew at an extraordinary pace under Lin's leadership—from 185,000 in 1988 to over one million by 1996, making it Taiwan's most popular newspaper. In a 1997 survey by Survey Research Taiwan, the Liberty Times surpassed the China Times and United Daily News for the first time, cementing its position as the island's leading publication. Lin's contributions helped transform what had been a local newspaper based in Taichung into a national institution with the largest circulation in Taiwan, eventually becoming one of the four most influential newspapers alongside Apple Daily, China Times, and United Daily News.[^23][^24]

Recognizing Taiwan's need for international visibility and English-language media representation, Lin founded the Taipei Times in June 1999 as an English-language sister publication to the Liberty Times. He was deeply concerned about Taiwan's struggle for international space and media coverage in a world where China sought to isolate the island diplomatically. The Taipei Times provided English-speaking audiences both domestically and internationally with news and perspectives from a distinctly Taiwanese viewpoint, filling a critical gap in the media landscape.[^25][^26]

Beyond publishing, Lin successfully diversified his business empire into Taiwan's financial sector. In March 1989, he established a preparatory office for what would become Union Bank of Taiwan (聯邦商業銀行), which officially commenced operations on January 21, 1992. The bank expanded Lin's influence into banking and financial services, complementing his real estate holdings and media properties. By 2022, Union Bank had developed into a comprehensive financial group covering banking, securities, investment trust, leasing, and venture capital, with capital expanding from the initial NT$12 billion to NT$32.9 billion and total assets approaching NT$820 billion.[^27][^28]

Lin's real estate acumen made him one of Taiwan's wealthiest individuals. He accumulated an estimated 400,000 ping (approximately 1.32 million square meters) of land holdings throughout Taiwan, with particularly valuable properties in Taipei and suburban areas. His company owned numerous commercial buildings in the capital, strategically positioned in areas experiencing rapid appreciation. Forbes ranked him as Taiwan's seventh richest person in 2008 with a net worth of $2.7 billion, and by his death in 2015, his fortune had grown to $4.2 billion, making him Taiwan's ninth richest individual.[^29][^30]

Lin received Taiwan's highest civilian honors in recognition of his contributions to democracy and media freedom. In 2000, President Lee Teng-hui awarded him the Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon, and in 2008, President Chen Shui-bian presented him with the Order of Propitious Clouds with Grand Cordon. These prestigious decorations acknowledged his role in promoting press freedom, democratic development, and Taiwanese cultural identity during the island's democratic transition.[^31][^32]

To promote literature and culture, Lin established the Lin Rong-San Foundation of Culture and Social Welfare (財團法人林榮三文化公益基金會), which created the Lin Rong-San Literary Award. The award, co-organized with the Liberty Times, offers substantial prizes across categories including short fiction (with a first prize of NT$500,000), essays, modern poetry, and short essays. The award has become one of Taiwan's most prestigious literary competitions, with many writers viewing it as "the highest hall of literary awards" and believing that winning almost guarantees book publication opportunities. By 2024, the award celebrated its 20th anniversary, having nurtured generations of Taiwanese writers.[^33][^34]

Lin's editorial philosophy extended beyond daily news coverage. He personally selected opinion pieces and editorials about Taiwan's future and compiled them into anthologies, which were gifted to readers in hopes that Taiwanese people would become more invested in their community and lay the foundations of a sovereign entity uniquely Taiwanese. This hands-on approach to editorial curation reflected his deep commitment to shaping Taiwan's political and cultural discourse.[^35]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Lin Rong-San's political and business career was marked by significant controversies that shadowed his achievements. The first major controversy emerged immediately after his 1975 Legislative Yuan election victory. Opposition candidate Kuo Yu-hsin, a prominent Tangwai movement figure from Yilan County, accused Lin of electoral fraud. Kuo hired distinguished opposition lawyers Lin Yi-hsiung and Yao Chia-wen to file suit against Lin for election irregularities. While the specifics of the allegations and their legal resolution are not extensively documented in available sources, this controversy cast a shadow over Lin's entry into politics and suggested that his political rise may have involved questionable methods typical of Taiwan's "black-gold politics" era.[^36][^37]

Lin's real estate dealings attracted particularly harsh criticism from housing justice advocates. In 1992, when Finance Minister Wang Chien-shuen attempted to implement "actual value assessment for land value increment tax" to curb real estate speculation, the Liberty Times reportedly opposed the reform. Housing activists characterized Lin as someone who "killed good policies" and eliminated Taiwan's chance for land and housing justice, suggesting that his media influence was used to protect his financial interests in real estate rather than serve the public good.[^38]

In 2014, civic groups participating in the "Nest Movement" (巢運) for housing justice directly criticized the Lin family for allegedly acquiring and speculating on land through Union Bank and Longshan Forest Construction (瓏山林) using questionable methods. Investigators found that starting in 2003, the Lin family began strategizing to acquire land in Taipei's prestigious Shilin district. Lin's youngest son, Lin Hung-yao (林鴻堯), purchased trust rights from Union Bank in seven transactions starting in 2011, rapidly gaining control of over half (537 square meters) of a 1,064 square meter property.[^39]

Critics accused Longshan Forest of employing tactics including "nominee owners," "trusts," and "fake gifts" to acquire land, circumventing regulations designed to prevent monopolistic land accumulation. In one case involving Fuyang Street, Union Bank allegedly rushed to establish property trusts before the city government approved urban renewal zoning, then exploited homeowners' unfamiliarity with urban renewal procedures and information gaps to "lock in" property owners interested in urban renewal. These allegations suggested a systematic approach to using financial and legal mechanisms to accumulate valuable urban land at the expense of ordinary property owners.[^40][^41]

Lin Hung-yao was convicted in 2014 by the Taiwan High Court for forgery in connection with a fake gift scheme involving land near the Shilin Official Residence. He was sentenced to four months imprisonment, commutable to a fine of NT$120,000. This conviction provided legal confirmation that at least some of the Lin family's land acquisition tactics crossed legal boundaries, though the conviction was limited to Lin's son rather than Lin Rong-San himself.[^42]

The broader criticism of Lin centered on the apparent contradiction between his public persona as a champion of democracy and Taiwanese values through the Liberty Times, and his private business practices that allegedly enriched his family at the expense of ordinary Taiwanese seeking affordable housing. Critics pointed out that while the Liberty Times promoted progressive political causes, Lin used his media empire's influence to block policies that would have reduced real estate speculation and improved housing affordability, protecting his vast land holdings and those of the Sanchong Gang.[^43]

Lin's association with the "Sanchong Gang"—the collective term for the business empires built by him and his two brothers—also drew criticism. While not a criminal organization, the term carried connotations of the "black-gold politics" (黑金政治) that characterized Taiwan's democratization period, where business tycoons leveraged political connections for commercial advantage and politicians relied on wealthy patrons for campaign financing. Lin's dual role as media baron and political figure raised concerns about conflicts of interest and the concentration of power.[^44]

## Personal Life

Lin Rong-San married Lin Chang Su-O (林張素娥), who played a significant role in the family business empire and served as chairperson of Federal Construction. Together they had four children: three sons and one daughter. Their family life was kept relatively private, though Lin's children became important figures in managing the various components of his business empire.[^45][^46]

The couple's eldest son, Lin Hung-lien (林鴻聯), took on responsibility for the financial sector of the family business, serving as general manager of Union Bank of Taiwan. The second son, Lin Hung-pang (林鴻邦), assumed leadership of the media empire as publisher of the Liberty Times, ensuring continuity of his father's vision for the newspaper. The youngest son, Lin Hung-yao (林鴻堯), became chairman of Longshan Forest Enterprise, managing real estate development. Their daughter, Lin Ya-chen (林雅真, also known as Lin Hsin-ai 林歆嬡), managed financial affairs for the Federal Group and later served as a director of Tian Wai Tian Cable Television in New Taipei City.[^47][^48]

Lin's personal wealth made his widow, Lin Chang Su-O, one of Taiwan's wealthiest women after his death. At age 82 in 2021, she was reported to have a net worth of approximately NT$60 billion (around $2 billion), making her Taiwan's wealthiest woman. This wealth consisted primarily of real estate holdings, shares in Union Bank, and stakes in the Liberty Times Group.[^49]

Lin Rong-San maintained close relationships with his two older brothers despite the 1978 division of the family business interests. The three brothers remained part of Taiwan's exclusive billionaire class and maintained the Sanchong Gang's influence over real estate, finance, and to some extent politics in northern Taiwan. His brother Lin Yu-lin (1936-2018) became known as "Taiwan's Land King" for his extensive property holdings, while the eldest brother Lin Yu-chi's family continued to operate Hung Kuo Group.[^50][^51]

Fu Jen Catholic University awarded Lin an honorary doctorate in law, recognizing his contributions to Taiwan society. This academic honor reflected the respect he commanded in certain circles despite the controversies surrounding his business practices.[^52]

Lin was described by colleagues as having strong political convictions about Taiwan's identity and future. He often reminded his employees at the Liberty Times to be the "voice of Taiwanese" while maintaining journalistic professionalism and objectivity. This suggests a personality that combined idealism about Taiwan's democratic development with the pragmatism necessary to build and maintain a business empire. He was known for his hands-on approach to newspaper management, personally reviewing editorials and opinion pieces that touched on Taiwan's political future.[^53][^54]

## Legacy

Lin Rong-San's death on November 28, 2015, at age 76 marked the end of an era for Taiwan's media landscape and political development. He passed away peacefully at home from cardiopulmonary failure caused by a tumor, surrounded by his children and family after treatment at National Taiwan University Hospital. The Liberty Times Group and Union Group acknowledged the loss with statements emphasizing that employees would "double their efforts and unite to continue their passionate service to society" in recognition of Lin's "pragmatic spirit, diligence and self-motivation."[^55][^56]

Lin's most enduring legacy is the transformation of Taiwan's media landscape through the Liberty Times. Under his ownership, the newspaper became the largest-circulation publication in Taiwan and the most important platform for Taiwanese identity and democratic values during the crucial period of democratization in the 1990s and 2000s. The Democratic Progressive Party's spokesperson stated that "The Liberty Times that Mr. Lin founded has become the most important platform for Taiwanese culture and values of democracy, which contributes greatly to promoting the freedom of the press, deepening of democracy in Taiwan and freedom of expression."[^57][^58]

The newspaper's motto "Taiwan Foremost, Liberty First" became a defining slogan for Taiwan's pro-independence movement and helped crystallize a distinct Taiwanese national consciousness separate from Chinese identity. Lin's editorial philosophy that Taiwan and localization represented "more than narrow independence or regionalism" but rather "the fusion of universal values of freedom and democracy" with Taiwan's unique character helped frame Taiwanese nationalism in liberal democratic rather than ethnic terms.[^59]

The Taipei Times, which Lin founded in 1999, continues to serve as Taiwan's primary English-language news source, providing international audiences with perspectives on Taiwan that counter Beijing's narratives. This contribution to Taiwan's international visibility and soft power remains significant as the island navigates complex geopolitical challenges.[^60]

Lin's literary foundation and the Lin Rong-San Literary Award continue to nurture Taiwanese writers and promote literature in Chinese. The award celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024, having established itself as one of Taiwan's most prestigious and generous literary competitions. Through this cultural institution, Lin's influence on Taiwanese arts and letters extends beyond his lifetime.[^61]

However, Lin's legacy is complicated by the controversies surrounding his real estate dealings and the perception that he used media influence to protect business interests at the expense of housing affordability for ordinary Taiwanese. Housing justice advocates continue to cite him as an example of how concentrated wealth and media ownership can undermine democratic policy-making, even as his newspapers championed democratic values.[^62]

The Federal Group, Union Bank, and Liberty Times Group continue operating under the management of Lin's children, preserving the business empire he built. The transfer of his wealth made his widow one of Taiwan's richest women and established his children as significant business figures, ensuring the Lin family's continued prominence in Taiwan's economic elite.[^63]

Political leaders across the spectrum paid tribute to Lin after his death, reflecting his complex position in Taiwan's political landscape. Former Chiayi County Magistrate Chang Hua-kuan expressed being "truly shocked and saddened," offering "deepest respect and condolences" and stating that "Lin Rong-San's dedication to defending freedom of speech could be said to be pioneering and fearless."[^64]

Lin's life story—from rice merchant's son to billionaire media mogul—embodies both the opportunities created by Taiwan's economic miracle and democratization, and the problematic concentration of wealth and power that accompanied rapid development. His ability to leverage business success into political influence and then use media ownership to shape political discourse represents a model that has few parallels in democratic societies, raising ongoing questions about media ownership, political economy, and democracy in Taiwan.[^65]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Lin Rong-San emphasize his crucial role in Taiwan's democratic development through fearless journalism and media entrepreneurship. The Liberty Times under his ownership provided a powerful platform for opposition voices during Taiwan's transition from authoritarian rule, helping to normalize discussion of Taiwanese identity and self-determination. Scholars of Taiwan's democratization note that independent media voices like the Liberty Times were essential counterweights to KMT-dominated media in the pre-2000 period, even though Lin himself was initially a KMT member.[^66]

Defenders point to Lin's personal courage in using his wealth to support causes that challenged powerful interests, particularly his newspapers' advocacy for Taiwan's distinct identity during a period when such positions were controversial and potentially dangerous. The fact that he received Taiwan's highest civilian honors from presidents of different political parties (Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian) suggests broad recognition of his contributions across political lines.[^67]

Lin's philanthropic work through his cultural foundation and literary award demonstrates a commitment to Taiwan's cultural development beyond commercial interests. The generous prizes offered by the Lin Rong-San Literary Award—including NT$500,000 for the top short fiction prize—have genuinely supported Taiwanese writers and enriched the island's literary culture. The foundation's 20-year history of promoting literature represents a sustained commitment to cultural patronage.[^68]

Business historians note Lin's exceptional entrepreneurial acumen in recognizing opportunities across multiple sectors—real estate, banking, and media—and successfully building integrated business empires. His ability to transform a local newspaper into Taiwan's largest circulation publication demonstrates both business skill and understanding of Taiwan's evolving political culture. From this perspective, Lin represents the positive aspects of Taiwan's entrepreneurial capitalism and economic dynamism.[^69]

Supporters also emphasize Lin's role in expanding press freedom and journalistic professionalism in Taiwan. He invested in hiring talented journalists, expanded news coverage, and supported investigative reporting on important public issues. Former employees and journalists have testified to his commitment to editorial quality and his hands-on involvement in maintaining high standards.[^70]

### Negative Views

Critics of Lin Rong-San emphasize the contradiction between his public championing of democracy and his private business practices that allegedly undermined housing justice and exploited legal loopholes for personal enrichment. Housing activists view Lin as emblematic of Taiwan's problem with powerful tycoons who use media ownership to protect business interests while presenting themselves as public servants. His opposition to land tax reform that would have curbed speculation represents, in this view, the cynical use of media power for private gain.[^71]

Scholars critical of Taiwan's media landscape point to Lin as an example of problematic media ownership concentration. The fact that one individual controlled Taiwan's largest newspaper while also owning a major bank, extensive real estate holdings, and holding political office created obvious conflicts of interest. Critics argue that the Liberty Times' editorial positions on economic policy cannot be evaluated independently from Lin's business interests, compromising journalistic integrity regardless of the newspaper's political courage on other issues.[^72]

The conviction of Lin's son for fraud in connection with land acquisition, and the documented use of questionable tactics by companies controlled by Lin's family, suggest that the business empire was built partly through methods that violated legal and ethical norms. Critics argue that Lin's wealth was accumulated not solely through entrepreneurial brilliance but through exploitation of political connections, information advantages, and willingness to circumvent regulations designed to prevent monopolistic practices.[^73]

Some political scientists view Lin as representing the problematic "black-gold politics" that plagued Taiwan's democratization, where business tycoons and politicians formed mutually beneficial relationships that enriched both while undermining genuine democracy and policy-making in the public interest. Lin's trajectory from controversial election victory amid fraud allegations in 1975, through political offices including Vice President of the Control Yuan, to media baron wielding political influence represents this problematic fusion of money and power.[^74]

Critics also question the sincerity of Lin's Taiwan identity advocacy, suggesting it may have been primarily a profitable business strategy rather than genuine ideological commitment. The Liberty Times' pro-independence stance attracted a loyal readership that could be monetized, while simultaneously providing Lin with political cover and influence. From this cynical perspective, Lin's nationalism was instrumentalized for commercial and political advantage.[^75]

Media scholars have noted that while the Liberty Times provided important alternative perspectives, it also demonstrated partisan bias that sometimes compromised journalistic standards. The newspaper's strong editorial slant and its founder's political connections raised questions about whether it truly served watchdog functions or primarily advanced particular political interests aligned with its owner's business concerns.[^76]
