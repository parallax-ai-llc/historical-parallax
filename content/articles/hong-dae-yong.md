## Summary

Hong Dae-yong was a Joseon Dynasty Silhak scholar who independently proposed the heliocentric model and Earth's rotation. He built an astronomical observatory and created a water clock. He visited Beijing in 1765 where he engaged with Western astronomy through Jesuit missionaries. His Uisan Mundap argued for Earth's rotation before this was widely accepted in East Asia.
