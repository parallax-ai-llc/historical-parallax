## Summary

Hyojong (born July 3, 1619; died June 23, 1659) was the 17th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1649 to 1659.[^1] He is best known for his lifelong ambition of **Bukbeol** (Northern Expedition), a plan to invade the Qing Dynasty to avenge the humiliation of his father King Injo (Samjeondo Humiliation). Having spent 8 years as a hostage in the Qing capital, he harbored a deep grudge against the Manchus. Although his dream of conquest was never realized, his military reforms strengthened the nation. He is also known for being the king who encountered the Dutch castaway **Hendrick Hamel**.[^2]

## Prince in Chains

Born **Yi Ho** (Grand Prince Bongrim), he was the second son of King Injo.
*   **Hostage Situation:** After Joseon's defeat in the Second Manchu Invasion (1636), he and his older brother, **Crown Prince Sohyeon**, were taken to Shenyang as hostages.
*   **Contrasting Views:** While Sohyeon became open to Qing culture and Western science, Hyojong remained steadfastly anti-Qing, dreaming only of revenge.[^3]

## The Northern Expedition (Bukbeol)

Upon ascending the throne in 1649 (after the suspicious death of his brother Sohyeon), Hyojong dedicated his reign to war preparations.
*   **Military Expansion:** He recruited the famous general **Lee Wan** and scholar **Song Si-yeol** to rebuild the army. He expanded the Musketeers Corps and strengthened border fortresses along the Yalu River.[^4]
*   **The Dream:** The plan was to strike when the Qing were distracted by internal rebellions. However, the Qing Dynasty grew stronger and stabilized, making the invasion impossible.
*   **Naseon Jeongbeol (Russian Expedition):** Ironically, his modernized musketeers were used not against the Qing, but *for* them. At Qing's request, Joseon troops were dispatched twice (1654, 1658) to fight Russian Cossacks near the Amur River, achieving decisive victories.[^5]

## Hamel and The Dutchman

In 1653, a Dutch ship, *De Sperwer*, wrecked on Jeju Island. **Hendrick Hamel** and 35 survivors were captured.
*   **Detention:** Hyojong forbade them from leaving ("It is not our custom to send foreigners away"), but treated them relatively well. He used their knowledge to improve Joseon's musketry.
*   **Escape:** Hamel eventually escaped to Japan in 1666 (during Hyeonjong's reign) and wrote the famous *Hamel's Journal*, introducing Korea to the West for the first time.[^6]
