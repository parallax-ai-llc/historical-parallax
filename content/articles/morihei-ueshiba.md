## Summary

Morihei Ueshiba was the founder of Aikido, a Japanese martial art deeply rooted in spiritual principles. He was influenced by the Omoto-kyo religion and Shinto mysticism, experiencing a spiritual awakening in 1925 that transformed his understanding of martial arts. He came to see true martial victory not as defeating others but as overcoming the discord within oneself. Aikido's philosophy of harmonizing with the attacker's energy reflects his spiritual vision.
