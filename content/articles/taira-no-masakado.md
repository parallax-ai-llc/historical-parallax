## Summary

Taira no Masakado (903–940) was a Heian period samurai warrior and provincial magnate who led Japan's first major rebellion against the imperial government in Kyoto. A fifth-generation descendant of Emperor Kanmu, Masakado proclaimed himself the "New Emperor" in 939, controlling the Kantō region for fifty-nine days before being killed in battle. His transformation from rebel to vengeful spirit (onryō) and eventually to protective deity reflects the complex interplay between authority, legitimacy, and folk religion in Japanese culture. Today, he is revered as one of Tokyo's guardian spirits and enshrined at Kanda Myōjin, while simultaneously feared as one of Japan's "Three Great Onryō."[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Taira no Masakado was born around 903 CE into the prestigious Kanmu Heishi branch of the Taira clan, descended from Emperor Kanmu who reigned from 781 to 806.[^3] The genealogical line proceeded through Prince Kazurawara, Prince Takami, and Prince Takamochi, who was granted the Taira surname in 889, establishing the warrior branch of the imperial descendants.[^4] Masakado's father, Taira no Yoshimasa (also known as Taira no Yoshimochi), served as Chinjufu-shōgun (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North) during the Heian Period, positioning the family prominently within provincial military circles.[^5]

The family's estates were located on the northern end of the Kantō plain, specifically in the Toyoda and Sashima districts of Shimōsa Province (modern-day Ibaraki and Chiba Prefectures), situated between the Kogai and Watarase rivers.[^6] This region was prime horse-ranching territory, which formed a substantial portion of the family's wealth and military power. As a young man of noble lineage with imperial blood, Masakado served at the imperial court in Heian-kyō (Kyoto) as was customary for aristocratic youth, gaining exposure to the political machinations and courtly culture of the capital.[^7]

After his service in the capital, Masakado returned to the eastern provinces to settle into the life of a country gentleman, managing his family's estates and building his power base among the provincial warrior class.[^8] The exact circumstances of his early years remain obscure due to limited written evidence from this period, but his education likely included martial training, horsemanship, and the administrative skills necessary for managing provincial territories. His experience at court would later inform his audacious claim to imperial authority, as he understood the symbolic power and organizational structure of the imperial system from firsthand observation.

The Kantō region where Masakado established himself was far from the cultural and political center of Kyoto, and provincial magnates like his family operated with considerable autonomy. The ritsuryō system of centralized governance was already showing signs of decay, with provincial governors often failing to exercise effective control over local strongmen who commanded private military forces. This power vacuum created the conditions for ambitious figures like Masakado to challenge the established order.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Masakado's ascent to prominence began not with grand ambitions of rebellion, but with bitter family disputes that escalated into open warfare. According to the Shōmonki, the primary historical source for Masakado's life, the conflict originated in 931 (Jōhei 1) when Masakado, freshly returned from Heian-kyō, became embroiled in a dispute with his paternal uncle Taira no Yoshikane over a woman.[^10] This woman was Yoshikane's daughter, whom Masakado had married, but who had apparently gone to live with him against her father's wishes. The Konjaku Monogatarishū, an alternative source, suggests a different catalyst: Masakado's uncles had appropriated lands that the young warrior was supposed to inherit from his late father.[^11]

These personal grievances ignited a protracted conflict that would draw in multiple branches of the Taira family and other provincial magnates. During one military engagement, Masakado's wife and children were forced to flee by boat for their safety, but Yoshikane discovered them and carried them off to Kazusa Province.[^12] Though the woman's brothers eventually allowed them to escape back to Masakado, such family betrayals and constant warfare hardened Masakado's character and military capabilities. In the struggle for dominance in the Kantō region, Masakado eliminated several of his own blood relatives, including multiple uncles, demonstrating both his martial prowess and his willingness to pursue power ruthlessly.[^13]

Masakado's military reputation grew with each victory. His forces became known for their discipline and effectiveness, and his success attracted followers from among the provincial warrior class who saw opportunity in aligning with a rising power. The turning point came in 939 when Masakado led an attack on the government outpost in Hitachi Province (modern-day Ibaraki Prefecture), capturing the provincial governor.[^14] This act transformed a family feud into open rebellion against the central government.

Emboldened by this success, Masakado's forces rapidly conquered Shimotsuke and Kozuke provinces (present-day Tochigi and Gunma Prefectures).[^15] In the twelfth month of 939 (Tengyō 2), Masakado took the extraordinary step of proclaiming himself the "New Emperor" (Shinnō). An entertainer claiming to be an oracle of the Great Bodhisattva Hachiman reportedly prophesied that Masakado had been conferred imperial rank by divine will.[^16] Prince Okiyo-ō, the acting governor of Musashi and one of Masakado's followers, encouraged this bold move, arguing that since Masakado had already made himself an outlaw by conquering one province, he might as well annex the rest of the east.[^17]

Using the mystique of his imperial blood and the religious legitimization provided by the supposed Hachiman oracle, Masakado organized his own court and appointed governors for the eight northern provinces of Japan, directly challenging the authority of the imperial government in Kyoto.[^18] This rebellion coincided with natural disasters including earthquakes, lunar eclipses, and unusual weather phenomena in the capital, which threw the court into panic and seemed to validate Masakado's claim to divine favor.[^19] The simultaneity of Masakado's eastern rebellion with pirate unrest in western Japan further strained the government's capacity to respond effectively.

## Major Achievements

Taira no Masakado's most significant achievement was launching Japan's first true rebellion against the Emperor since the establishment of the Kyoto government 100 years earlier.[^20] This act of defiance represented a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of imperial authority and demonstrated that provincial military power could successfully contest the theoretical supremacy of the central government. In doing so, Masakado established precedents that would shape Japanese political development for centuries to come.

During his brief period of control over the Kantō region in late 939 and early 940, Masakado demonstrated considerable organizational and military capabilities. He successfully coordinated the capture and administration of multiple provinces, including Shimōsa, Kazusa, Awa, Hitachi, Shimotsuke, Kōzuke, Musashi, and Sagami.[^21] His ability to rapidly conquer this extensive territory and establish a functioning administrative apparatus revealed both his military genius and his understanding of governance learned during his time at the imperial court.

Masakado's proclamation of a rival imperial court, while short-lived, represented a sophisticated political maneuver. By appointing governors to the eight northern provinces and organizing his own bureaucratic structure, he created the framework for an independent regional government.[^22] This was not merely military conquest but an attempt to establish legitimate political authority based on imperial precedent. His claim rested on his imperial descent—as a fifth-generation descendant of Emperor Kanmu, his blood claim was theoretically valid, even if politically unacceptable to the established order.

The military campaigns themselves demonstrated Masakado's tactical brilliance. Operating in the horse-ranching country where he had grown up, he leveraged superior cavalry tactics and intimate knowledge of the terrain to defeat numerically superior forces. His victories against various provincial governors and rival military leaders, including members of his own extended family, established him as the preeminent military commander in eastern Japan. The rapidity of his conquests—taking control of eight provinces in a matter of months—speaks to both his military effectiveness and the weakness of central government authority in the provinces.

Perhaps most importantly, Masakado's rebellion exposed the fundamental vulnerabilities of the Heian court's control over outlying regions. The revolt was "symptomatic of the deterioration of the central government's hold over the countryside and presaged the development of powerful warlord families in the provinces."[^23] His actions demonstrated that military power, not court rank or imperial appointment, determined effective control of territory. This revelation would fundamentally reshape Japanese political structure, paving the way for the rise of the samurai class and the eventual establishment of the shogunate system that would dominate Japan for the next 700 years.

Masakado is often called "the first samurai" because he was the first warrior to challenge the imperial system directly and create his own independent military government.[^24] His rebellion established patterns of regional autonomy, military governance, and warrior-class identity that would be repeated and refined by subsequent generations. The Taira clan, from which Masakado descended, would eventually become one of the most powerful warrior families in Japan, culminating in Taira no Kiyomori's near-complete control of the imperial court in the late 12th century.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Taira no Masakado's rebellion against the imperial government constituted an act of supreme treason by the standards of his time, earning him the designation of rebel (gyakuzoku) and enemy of the state. The imperial court in Kyoto placed a bounty on his head, and contemporary court records framed his actions as disrupting tax collection and provincial governance while threatening the divine order embodied by the emperor.[^25] From the perspective of the established authorities, Masakado was an upstart provincial warlord whose ambitions endangered the fundamental structure of Japanese society.

The Shōmonki itself, despite being the primary source sympathetic to Masakado, contains criticism of his character and judgment. The text describes him as "frivolous" and includes the damning assessment: "Thus, the New Emperor demonstrated that he was not a man of the world, but more like a big fish in a small pond."[^26] This characterization suggests that even sources close to Masakado recognized his limitations—his provincial perspective, lack of sophisticated political maneuvering, and perhaps naive belief that military success alone could legitimize his imperial pretensions.

The methods by which Masakado rose to power involved considerable violence against his own family members. His elimination of multiple uncles and other relatives in the pursuit of inheritance rights and regional dominance demonstrated a ruthless pragmatism that, while typical of the warrior class, nevertheless constituted kinslaying—a serious moral transgence in Confucian-influenced Japanese society.[^27] These family conflicts, originating in disputes over women and land, revealed personal ambitions and grievances rather than principled opposition to imperial misrule, complicating any narrative of Masakado as a freedom fighter or champion of regional autonomy.

The reliability of key elements of Masakado's legitimizing narrative has been questioned by historians. The oracle of Hachiman proclaiming Masakado's divine right to imperial status, his building of a new imperial palace, and his formal appointment of provincial governors appear only in the Shōmonki and derived texts—they are conspicuously absent from court records and other contemporary sources.[^28] This discrepancy raises the possibility that these elements were embellished or fabricated, either by Masakado himself for propaganda purposes or by later sympathetic chroniclers seeking to romanticize his rebellion.

During the Meiji Period (1868-1912), when the imperial system was restored and strengthened as the foundation of modern Japanese nationalism, Masakado was officially viewed as a rebel and traitor. His association with challenging imperial authority made him an uncomfortable figure for a government that based its legitimacy on unbroken imperial succession and divine imperial authority.[^29] This period saw the suppression of sympathetic portrayals of Masakado and emphasis on his status as an enemy of the legitimate order.

The geographical divide in historical assessment of Masakado reflects ongoing tensions between center and periphery in Japanese culture. Writers from Kyoto and western Japan traditionally demonized Masakado, while eastern sources, particularly from the Kantō region, portrayed him more sympathetically.[^30] This regional bias complicates efforts to achieve an objective historical assessment, as interpretations have been shaped as much by the author's geographic and political allegiances as by careful evaluation of evidence.

Some modern historians have noted that while Masakado is celebrated for standing up for the downtrodden, his actual motivations appear to have been personal ambition and family grievances rather than social justice or reform.[^31] His appointment of governors and creation of an alternative government structure replicated rather than reformed the existing system—he sought to become emperor, not to abolish the institution or alleviate the burdens of common people. The romanticization of Masakado as a champion of the marginalized may owe more to later folk traditions than to historical reality.

## Personal Life

Taira no Masakado's personal life was intimately entangled with the political and military conflicts that defined his career. His wife was the daughter of his paternal uncle, Taira no Yoshikane, and this marriage became a flashpoint for family conflict when the woman went to live with Masakado apparently against her father's wishes.[^32] This domestic dispute, seemingly trivial, escalated into the broader warfare that eventually consumed the Taira clan in the Kantō region. The marriage produced children, though specific details about their names and numbers remain scarce in historical records.

During the military campaigns against Yoshikane, Masakado's wife and children were forced to flee by boat to escape the fighting, only to be captured by Yoshikane who took them to Kazusa Province.[^33] This traumatic separation was eventually resolved when the woman's brothers facilitated their escape back to Masakado, but the incident reveals the personal costs of the family conflicts. The loyalty of Masakado's wife to her husband over her father suggests either strong personal devotion or calculation about which faction would ultimately prevail in the power struggle.

Masakado had at least one daughter, known to history as Takiyasha (or Princess Takiyasha), who became a legendary figure in her own right.[^34] According to folklore, after Masakado's death and the defeat of his forces, Takiyasha continued to live in the ruins of her father's palace. She became known as "Takiyasha the Witch" and was credited with supernatural powers, including the ability to summon giant skeleton demons. The famous 19th-century ukiyo-e print by Utagawa Kuniyoshi depicting Takiyasha summoning a colossal skeleton remains one of the most iconic images in Japanese art.[^35] While these magical elements are clearly legendary, Takiyasha's transformation into a witch figure in folklore may reflect historical resistance to Masakado's defeat or the lingering influence of his family even after the rebellion was crushed.

As a member of the provincial warrior class with imperial blood, Masakado occupied an ambiguous social position. He possessed the prestige of descent from Emperor Kanmu but had been demoted to commoner (though elevated) status as part of the Taira clan.[^36] This liminal identity—too aristocratic to be merely a provincial warrior, too provincial to be accepted by the court nobility—may have contributed to his willingness to challenge the established order. His time serving at the imperial court in his youth exposed him to the sophisticated culture and political intrigue of Heian-kyō, giving him both admiration for and resentment of the central government's power.

The Shōmonki describes the initial conflict with Yoshikane as involving "a dispute over a woman," suggesting that beyond his wife, there may have been romantic or sexual entanglements that complicated family relationships.[^37] The patriarchal society of Heian Japan meant that women often served as pawns or prizes in political arrangements, but the sources hint that personal passions and choices—both Masakado's and those of the women involved—played roles in igniting the conflicts.

Masakado's personality emerges from the historical sources as complex and contradictory. He demonstrated military brilliance, organizational capacity, and charismatic leadership that attracted followers and enabled rapid conquest of multiple provinces. Yet the characterization of him as "frivolous" and "a big fish in a small pond" suggests limitations in political sophistication and perhaps an inability to fully appreciate the formidable resources the imperial court could ultimately marshal against him.[^38] His decision to proclaim himself emperor, while audacious, may have reflected overconfidence born from a string of military successes and inadequate understanding of the symbolic and political dimensions of imperial authority.

## Legacy

Taira no Masakado's legacy is one of the most complex and enduring in Japanese history, transforming dramatically over the centuries from rebel to demon to deity. His death in 940 marked not an ending but the beginning of his metamorphosis into myth, as legends immediately began to accumulate around his decapitated head. According to tradition, after Masakado was killed by an arrow to the head at the Battle of Kojima, his severed head was brought to Kyoto and displayed as a warning to other potential rebels.[^39] However, the head reportedly did not decay, and legends claim it cried out in the capital before miraculously flying back to the east, landing in what is now the Otemachi district of Tokyo.[^40]

This supernatural transformation established Masakado as an onryō (vengeful spirit), one of the most powerful and dangerous categories of supernatural beings in Japanese belief. Along with Sugawara no Michizane and Emperor Sutoku, Masakado is recognized as one of the "Three Great Onryō of Japan."[^41] The belief in his vengeful spirit has persisted for over a millennium, and the site where his head supposedly landed—the Masakado no Kubizuka (Masakado's Head Mound) in Otemachi—remains one of the most respected and feared supernatural sites in Tokyo.

The kubizuka occupies some of the most expensive real estate in the world, located in Tokyo's financial district just a five-minute walk from the Imperial Palace.[^42] Despite intense development pressure, the site has been meticulously maintained because of the belief that neglecting it brings misfortune. The most dramatic demonstration of this belief occurred after the massive 1923 Great Kantō Earthquake, when the Ministry of Finance planned to establish a new building on the site. The project was canceled after the Minister of Finance, Sasoku Seiji, and fourteen other people connected to the project died mysteriously, with countless others suffering inexplicable accidents.[^43] In 1984, following public pressure and continued incidents attributed to Masakado's curse, his deity status was formally reinstated, and the site continues to be carefully maintained.[^44]

Masakado's transformation from rebel to protective deity was completed through his enshrinement at Kanda Myōjin (Kanda Shrine), one of Tokyo's most important Shinto shrines, founded in 730.[^45] Initially located near the kubizuka in Otemachi, the shrine was relocated in the early 17th century when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu decided to expand Edo Castle.[^46] At Kanda Myōjin, Masakado is worshipped as one of three main deities and is revered as a protector deity of Tokyo, a god of business success, and a patron of victory in battle.[^47] His popularity reached its peak among Edo's common people during the 17th to 19th centuries, who embraced him as a symbol of cultural resistance to Kyoto's aristocratic pretensions and as a champion of the eastern provinces against the central government's exploitation.[^48]

The reverence and fear surrounding Masakado extend into modern practice. Television stations in Tokyo routinely visit his grave before broadcasting any show featuring his character, paying respects to avoid incurring his wrath.[^49] The persistence of these practices in contemporary Japan—one of the world's most technologically advanced societies—demonstrates the profound grip Masakado's legend maintains on the cultural imagination.

Masakado's historical significance in the development of the samurai class and military governance cannot be overstated. Historian Karl Friday and other scholars argue that Masakado represents "the very first samurai" because he was the first warrior to directly challenge the imperial system and establish an independent military government.[^50] His rebellion demonstrated that effective political power had shifted from court rank and imperial appointment to military capacity, a revelation that fundamentally altered Japanese political development. The precedents he established—regional autonomy, military governance, and warrior-class identity—were refined by subsequent generations and culminated in the shogunate system that dominated Japan from the 12th to 19th centuries.

The manner in which Masakado has been viewed has changed dramatically across different historical periods: enemy of the Imperial Court in ancient times; venerated folk hero during the medieval period; designated rebel (gyakuzoku) during the Meiji Period when imperial authority was restored; and rehabilitated as a tragic hero after World War II.[^51] Each era has reinterpreted Masakado according to its own political and cultural concerns, making him a kind of historical Rorschach test reflecting attitudes toward authority, regional identity, and the relationship between the individual and the state.

In contemporary popular culture, Masakado has transcended history to become a symbol in modern media. He appears prominently in the Megami Tensei video game franchise, where he is depicted as a powerful guardian spirit protecting Tokyo.[^52] His character features in numerous anime, manga, novels, and other video games, often portrayed as a tragic figure imbued with supernatural power.[^53] These modern interpretations continue the centuries-old tradition of reimagining Masakado for contemporary audiences, ensuring his relevance to new generations of Japanese and international audiences.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly reassessment of Taira no Masakado, particularly in the post-World War II period, has increasingly emphasized his significance as a transformative figure in Japanese history rather than merely a rebel or traitor. Karl Friday's comprehensive analysis presents Masakado as "the very first samurai," whose actions and conflicts represented the drama that would inevitably recur in Japan's rapidly evolving military, political, and social structures over subsequent centuries.[^54] This interpretation positions Masakado not as an aberration but as a harbinger of fundamental changes in how political power would be exercised in Japan.

Modern historians have challenged established narratives regarding the formation and identity of the samurai class, with Masakado serving as a crucial case study. His rebellion demonstrated that the ritsuryō system of centralized bureaucratic governance was crumbling, and that military power exercised by provincial magnates had become the determining factor in effective control of territory.[^55] From this perspective, Masakado's defiance was not simply personal ambition but a manifestation of broader structural changes in Japanese society that would eventually produce the shogunate system.

In the Kantō region, particularly, Masakado has long been viewed sympathetically as a champion of the eastern provinces against exploitation by the Kyoto court. Folk traditions emphasize his efforts to stand up for the downtrodden and social outcasts, portraying him as a heroic figure who gave his life fighting for regional autonomy and justice.[^56] This regional interpretation celebrates Masakado as a man who challenged the harsh rule of the central government at a time when court officials were criticized for illegal acts and taking advantage of the court's limited influence in the provinces.[^57]

The transformation of Masakado from rebel to protective deity reflects a kind of popular vindication of his cause. The people of Edo (later Tokyo) revered him not despite his rebellion but because of it, seeing in his defiance a validation of their own identity distinct from the aristocratic culture of Kyoto.[^58] His enshrinement at Kanda Myōjin and continued veneration as a guardian spirit of Tokyo represents a form of historical judgment by the common people, who chose to honor rather than condemn his memory. This folk canonization suggests that ordinary Japanese recognized in Masakado's struggle themes of resistance, autonomy, and challenging unjust authority that resonated across centuries.

Contemporary scholars also note that Masakado's claim to imperial authority, while politically unsuccessful, was not entirely without merit. As a fifth-generation descendant of Emperor Kanmu, his blood claim had theoretical validity within the logic of imperial succession.[^59] His time serving at the imperial court gave him firsthand knowledge of governmental procedures and courtly culture. The oracle of Hachiman proclaiming his divine mandate, whatever its historical accuracy, demonstrated sophisticated understanding of how imperial legitimacy was constructed and maintained through religious validation.

Literary scholars studying the Shōmonki and other texts featuring Masakado have explored how his story raises questions about loyalty, legitimacy, and the relationship between center and periphery in Japanese culture. The anonymous author of the Shōmonki, likely someone close to Masakado, crafted a narrative that, while acknowledging his ultimate defeat, preserves sympathy for his cause and portrays him as a complex, multidimensional figure rather than a simple villain.[^60] This textual tradition ensured that alternative perspectives on Masakado's rebellion would survive alongside official condemnation, creating space for later rehabilitation of his reputation.

### Negative Views

Despite romanticization in folk tradition and recent scholarly rehabilitation, substantial criticisms of Taira no Masakado persist in historical assessment. The fundamental charge of treason remains unavoidable—Masakado directly challenged the authority of the emperor, an act that constituted the most serious crime imaginable in the Heian political and religious system. The imperial court's contemporary records consistently frame his rebellion as disrupting tax collection, undermining provincial governance, and threatening the divine order embodied by imperial rule.[^61]

Even sympathetic sources acknowledge significant character flaws and limitations. The Shōmonki's characterization of Masakado as "frivolous" and "not a man of the world, but more like a big fish in a small pond" suggests provincial narrow-mindedness and lack of political sophistication.[^62] His apparent belief that military conquest alone could legitimize his claim to imperial status revealed inadequate understanding of the symbolic, religious, and political dimensions of imperial authority. This strategic naïveté contributed directly to his rapid defeat once the court mobilized resources against him.

The origins of Masakado's rebellion in petty family disputes over women and inheritance rights undermine narratives that portray him as a principled reformer or champion of the oppressed. His elimination of multiple family members, including uncles and other relatives, in pursuit of personal power demonstrated ruthless ambition rather than commitment to social justice.[^63] The romantic reconstruction of Masakado as a freedom fighter appears to owe more to later folk traditions and regional pride than to the historical record of his actual motivations and actions.

Skepticism about key legitimizing elements of Masakado's rebellion remains warranted. The oracle of Hachiman proclaiming his divine right to imperial status appears only in the Shōmonki and derived texts, conspicuously absent from court records and other contemporary sources.[^64] This discrepancy suggests possible fabrication or embellishment, either as propaganda during the rebellion or as romantic enhancement by later chroniclers. The reliability of the Shōmonki itself has been questioned, given its anonymous authorship, uncertain dating, and blend of verifiable military actions with legendary motifs such as prophetic dreams and divine omens.[^65]

During the Meiji Period, when modern Japanese nationalism was constructed around restored and strengthened imperial authority, Masakado was officially designated a rebel (gyakuzoku) and enemy of the state.[^66] This interpretation, while politically motivated, reflects the uncomfortable reality that Masakado's legacy fundamentally challenges narratives of unbroken imperial sovereignty and divine imperial authority. His successful (if temporary) establishment of an alternative imperial court demonstrated that imperial claims could be contested, a dangerous precedent from the perspective of regimes based on imperial legitimacy.

The geographic divide in interpretations of Masakado reveals how regional biases have shaped historical assessment. Writers from Kyoto and western Japan traditionally demonized him, while eastern sources portrayed him more sympathetically.[^67] This pattern suggests that evaluations of Masakado have been determined as much by the author's geographic and political allegiances as by objective analysis of evidence. Neither the hagiographic eastern tradition nor the condemnatory western tradition can be taken as definitive, and both must be recognized as products of regional identity politics as much as historical scholarship.

Some historians argue that Masakado's actual governance during his brief period of control over the Kantō provinces likely replicated rather than reformed the exploitative structures he ostensibly opposed. His appointment of provincial governors and creation of an alternative bureaucratic hierarchy mimicked the existing system rather than proposing substantive changes that would benefit common people.[^68] The romanticization of Masakado as a champion of the downtrodden may reflect wishful thinking and folk tradition rather than analysis of his actual policies and impacts on the lives of ordinary people in the territories he controlled.

## Famous Quotes

> "The Great Bodhisattva Hachiman has conferred imperial rank upon Masakado."

This proclamation, attributed to an oracle and entertainer in 939, provided religious legitimization for Masakado's claim to imperial authority. Whether genuine prophecy or political theater, this declaration enabled Masakado to frame his rebellion in terms of divine mandate rather than mere military conquest, drawing on the same religious validation that supported imperial authority in Kyoto.[^69]

> "Now that you have already made yourself an outlaw by striking down one province, you might as well annex the rest of the east."

Prince Okiyo-ō, acting governor of Musashi and one of Masakado's followers, reportedly made this argument encouraging Masakado to expand his rebellion from a local conflict into a full challenge to imperial authority. This counsel reflects the logic of escalation that transformed Masakado from a provincial warlord to self-proclaimed emperor.[^70]

> "Thus, the New Emperor demonstrated that he was not a man of the world, but more like a big fish in a small pond."

This critical assessment from the Shōmonki itself reveals that even sources sympathetic to Masakado recognized his limitations. The characterization suggests provincial narrow-mindedness and lack of sophisticated political understanding, foreshadowing his ultimate defeat by more experienced and resourceful opponents from the central government.[^71]

> "His head did not decay, and cried out in the capital."

This legendary description, emerging in the centuries after Masakado's death, captures the transformation of the historical rebel into a supernatural entity. The refusal of his head to decay and its supernatural crying symbolized the unfinished nature of his rebellion and the continuing threat his memory posed to established authority.[^72]

> "Masakado-sama, please protect Tokyo."

This contemporary prayer, regularly offered at both the kubizuka in Otemachi and Kanda Myōjin shrine, reflects the complete transformation of Masakado from rebel to protective deity. Businesspeople, politicians, and ordinary Tokyo residents invoke his protection, demonstrating how thoroughly his legend has been integrated into the spiritual landscape of modern Tokyo.[^73]
