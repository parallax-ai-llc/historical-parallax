## Summary

Hirata Atsutane was a Japanese kokugaku (National Learning) scholar who developed a systematic Shinto theology in opposition to Buddhism and Confucianism. He argued for the literal truth of Japanese creation myths and developed concepts of the afterlife based on Shinto principles. His ideas about Japanese spiritual superiority influenced the nationalist movement that led to the Meiji Restoration. He wrote over 100 works on Shinto theology and Japanese identity.
