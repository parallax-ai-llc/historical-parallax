## Summary

Danjong (born August 9, 1441; died November 7, 1457) was the 6th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning briefly from 1452 to 1455.[^1] His life is the saddest tragedy in the Joseon royal lineage. Ascending the throne at age 11 after the death of his father **Munjong**, he was too young to rule. His ambitious uncle, **Grand Prince Suyang** (Sejo), seized power in a coup, forced Danjong to abdicate, exiled him to the remote **Yeongwol** county, and eventually ordered him to drink poison at the age of 16. His body was thrown into a river, forbidden to be buried, until a loyal local official secretly laid him to rest.[^2]

## The Child King

Danjong was the only son of King Munjong. His mother died giving birth to him, and his father died when he was just 11.
*   **Vulnerable:** Without strong maternal relatives to protect him, he was left in the care of his father's loyal ministers, **Kim Jong-seo** and **Hwangbo In**. However, political power naturally gravitated towards his adult uncle, the charismatic and ruthless Grand Prince Suyang.[^3]

## The Coup and Abdication

*   **Gyeyu Jeongnan (1453):** Suyang murdered Kim Jong-seo and other guardians in a bloody coup. Danjong became a puppet king, living in fear.
*   **Abdication (1455):** Under immense pressure, Danjong "voluntarily" handed the royal seal to his uncle and moved out of the main palace, becoming "King Emeritus" (Sangwang).

## Exile and Death

*   **Prince Nosan:** After the **Six Martyred Ministers** plot failed in 1456, Sejo stripped Danjong of his royal title, demoting him to "Prince Nosan," and banished him to **Cheongryeongpo** in Yeongwol—a landlocked island surrounded by steep cliffs and a river.
*   **The End:** In 1457, after another rebellion attempt by his uncle Prince Geumseong, Sejo ordered Danjong's death. According to the annals, he drank poison (Sayak). Legends say the royal executioner was too hesitant, so a servant strangled him. He was 16 years old.[^4]
