## Summary

Queen Anne (1665-1714) was the last monarch of the House of Stuart and the first sovereign of the Kingdom of Great Britain, reigning from 1702 until her death in 1714. Her reign witnessed the formal union of England and Scotland through the Acts of Union 1707, creating the Kingdom of Great Britain, and saw Britain emerge as a major European power during the War of the Spanish Succession. Despite being plagued by poor health throughout her life and experiencing the tragedy of losing all seventeen of her children in infancy or childhood, Anne proved to be a more politically engaged and capable ruler than many contemporaries expected. Her reign marked a crucial transition period in British constitutional history, with the further development of parliamentary government and the party system, though her legacy has often been overshadowed by the dramatic events of the preceding and subsequent reigns.

## Early Life and Background

Anne was born on February 6, 1665, at St James's Palace in London, the fourth child and second daughter of James, Duke of York (later King James II) and his first wife, Lady Anne Hyde[^1]. Her early years were marked by family tragedy, as her mother died when Anne was only six years old, and most of her siblings died in infancy or early childhood. Only Anne and her elder sister Mary survived to adulthood[^2]. The circumstances of her birth placed her in a complex religious and political environment, as her father had secretly converted to Roman Catholicism in the 1660s, though Anne herself was raised as a Protestant in accordance with the wishes of her uncle, King Charles II[^3].

Anne's education was typical for a princess of her era, focusing on languages, music, dancing, and religious instruction, though it was not particularly rigorous by scholarly standards[^4]. She developed a lifelong love of music and became an accomplished player of the guitar and harpsichord. Her Protestant upbringing was carefully supervised, with Bishop Henry Compton of London playing a significant role in her religious education[^5]. This Protestant faith would prove crucial to her political future, as it distinguished her from her Catholic father and eventually secured her claim to the throne.

From an early age, Anne suffered from poor health, experiencing what historians believe may have been a form of lupus or another autoimmune disorder[^6]. She also suffered from what was described as "gout" and eye problems that caused her vision to deteriorate over the years. These health issues would plague her throughout her life and significantly impact her ability to fulfill her royal duties, particularly in her later years[^7]. Despite these challenges, Anne developed a reputation for piety, dedication to the Church of England, and a stubborn determination that would characterize her reign.

The political crisis of the Exclusion Crisis (1679-1681), which attempted to exclude her father from the succession due to his Catholicism, profoundly shaped Anne's early political consciousness[^8]. Although she was young during these events, they established the fundamental principle that would later justify her own accession: that Protestantism took precedence over strict hereditary succession in determining who should rule Britain.

## Rise to Power

Anne's path to the throne was neither straightforward nor inevitable. In 1683, at the age of eighteen, she married Prince George of Denmark, a Protestant prince who proved to be a devoted if politically insignificant husband[^9]. The marriage was apparently happy on a personal level, though it produced heartbreaking results: Anne became pregnant at least seventeen times, but not a single child survived to adulthood. Her longest-surviving child, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, lived to the age of eleven before his death in 1700, leaving Anne devastated and the succession in crisis[^10].

The Glorious Revolution of 1688 placed Anne in an extraordinarily difficult position. Her father, King James II, had alienated much of the political nation through his attempts to promote Catholicism and rule without Parliament[^11]. When William of Orange invaded England at the invitation of leading politicians, Anne faced a choice between loyalty to her father and commitment to her Protestant faith and the constitutional settlement. She chose the latter, abandoning her father and supporting William and her elder sister Mary, who became joint monarchs as William III and Mary II[^12]. This decision, while politically necessary, caused Anne considerable emotional distress and contributed to a sense of guilt that some historians believe affected her later reign.

Anne's relationship with her sister Queen Mary became strained during the 1690s, largely due to Anne's close friendship with Sarah Churchill, a relationship that Mary and William viewed with suspicion[^13]. The two sisters were reportedly not reconciled before Mary's death from smallpox in 1694. After Mary's death, Anne became heir presumptive to William III, though their relationship remained cool[^14]. William excluded Anne from any significant political role, and she spent these years in relative political isolation, observing court politics from a distance.

The death of Anne's son William, Duke of Gloucester, in 1700 created a succession crisis that would have profound implications for British history[^15]. With no Protestant heir in the immediate Stuart line, Parliament passed the Act of Settlement in 1701, which provided that the throne would pass to Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant descendants if Anne died without surviving issue[^16]. This act effectively disinherited dozens of Catholics with stronger hereditary claims, prioritizing religious considerations over bloodline.

When William III died on March 8, 1702, Anne succeeded to the thrones of England, Scotland, and Ireland at the age of thirty-seven[^17]. Her accession was generally welcomed, as she was seen as a more traditionally English monarch than the Dutch William, and her strong Anglican faith appealed to the established church and Tory politicians. In her first speech to Parliament, Anne famously declared, "I know my heart to be entirely English," a statement calculated to appeal to nationalist sentiment and distinguish her from her foreign-born predecessor[^18].

## Major Achievements

The most significant and enduring achievement of Anne's reign was the Acts of Union 1707, which united the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into a single Kingdom of Great Britain[^19]. This union, which had been attempted and failed multiple times over the preceding century, was accomplished through a combination of political negotiation, economic incentives, and strategic pressure. The Scottish Parliament agreed to the union partly due to the economic opportunities it promised, particularly access to English colonial trade, and partly due to the failure of the Darien Scheme, which had bankrupted many Scottish investors[^20]. Anne took a personal interest in achieving this union, viewing it as essential for national security and as a major accomplishment of her reign. On May 1, 1707, when the union took effect, Anne became the first monarch of Great Britain, and she attended a special service of thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral despite her failing health[^21].

Anne's reign coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), in which Britain and its allies fought to prevent the union of the French and Spanish crowns under the Bourbon dynasty[^22]. Under the military leadership of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough (husband of Anne's favorite Sarah Churchill), British forces achieved a series of spectacular victories, including Blenheim (1704), Ramillies (1706), Oudenarde (1708), and Malplaquet (1709)[^23]. These victories established Britain as a major military power and significantly enhanced British prestige in Europe. Anne strongly supported the war effort initially, and the victories brought glory to her reign, though she later grew weary of the conflict and its costs.

The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which ended Britain's involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession, secured significant territorial and commercial gains for Britain[^24]. Britain obtained Gibraltar and Minorca, providing crucial naval bases in the Mediterranean, and gained important concessions in North America, including Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, and Nova Scotia from France[^25]. Perhaps most significantly, Britain obtained the Asiento, a monopoly on supplying slaves to Spanish America, which proved extremely profitable and strengthened Britain's position in the Atlantic slave trade[^26]. While morally reprehensible by modern standards, contemporaries viewed these gains as major achievements that enhanced British wealth and power.

Anne took her role as Supreme Governor of the Church of England seriously and worked to strengthen the established church[^27]. In 1704, she established "Queen Anne's Bounty," a fund to augment the incomes of poor clergy, redistributing revenue that had previously gone to the crown[^28]. This initiative improved the financial position of many parish priests and demonstrated Anne's genuine concern for the church. She also supported the building of fifty new churches in London and its suburbs, though only twelve were actually completed during and after her reign[^29]. These "Queen Anne churches," including St Paul's Deptford and St George's Bloomsbury, remain architectural landmarks.

Anne's reign saw significant cultural and intellectual flourishing, sometimes called the "Augustan Age" of English literature[^30]. Writers such as Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, and Richard Steele produced some of their most important works during this period. While Anne was not personally responsible for this cultural efflorescence, she was a patron of the arts and maintained a court that encouraged literary and artistic achievement[^31]. The development of periodical literature, including The Tatler and The Spectator, helped create a more sophisticated public sphere for political and cultural debate.

The two-party system of Whigs and Tories became more clearly defined and institutionalized during Anne's reign[^32]. While this development had roots in earlier periods, Anne's reign saw the parties compete more systematically for power and develop more coherent ideological positions. Anne herself played an active role in this party politics, dismissing and appointing ministers, and attempting to balance the parties according to her own political judgment and preferences[^33]. This marked an important stage in the development of British parliamentary government, though the full cabinet system would not emerge until after her death.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Anne's reign was marked by intense political factional conflict that she struggled to manage effectively. Her personal preferences and strong religious convictions often led her to favor Tory politicians, who supported the Church of England and were more sympathetic to royal prerogative, over Whigs, who were more religiously tolerant and supportive of parliamentary power[^34]. This favoritism created political instability, with frequent changes of ministry that reflected Anne's shifting personal allegiances rather than coherent policy considerations. Critics argued that her inability to rise above party politics and govern as a truly national monarch weakened the effectiveness of government[^35].

The most controversial aspect of Anne's political management was her dependence on personal favorites, particularly Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, who wielded enormous influence over the Queen from the 1680s until their dramatic rupture in 1710[^36]. Sarah, a brilliant but domineering woman with strong Whig sympathies, effectively controlled access to the Queen and influenced political appointments for many years. Their relationship deteriorated as Anne grew resentful of Sarah's overbearing manner and political interference, and Sarah was eventually replaced in Anne's affections by Abigail Masham, a Tory sympathizer[^37]. This transition caused a major political crisis and contributed to the fall of the Whig ministry. Many contemporaries and later historians criticized Anne for allowing personal relationships to dictate political decisions, arguing that government policy should not be determined by bedchamber intrigue[^38].

Anne's later shift toward peace in the War of the Spanish Succession proved highly controversial. By 1710, weary of the war's costs in lives and money, and influenced by her new Tory ministers and favorites, Anne dismissed Marlborough and the Whig ministry that had prosecuted the war vigorously[^39]. The Tory government that replaced them negotiated what many Whigs considered a disgraceful separate peace, abandoning Britain's allies and failing to secure all the war aims for which so much blood had been spilled[^40]. The methods used to secure parliamentary approval for the peace, including the creation of twelve new Tory peers in one day to overwhelm Whig opposition in the House of Lords, were seen as constitutional manipulation[^41]. Critics argued that Anne had betrayed Marlborough, who had won brilliant victories for her, and had allowed party politics to override national interest.

Anne's strong commitment to the Church of England led her to support legislation that discriminated against religious dissenters and harmed national unity[^42]. The Occasional Conformity Act (1711) and the Schism Act (1714) were designed to restrict the civil and religious rights of Protestant nonconformists, even though these groups had been loyal supporters of the Protestant succession[^43]. These acts were deeply divisive and served no purpose other than to satisfy High Church Tory sentiment. Anne's support for such religiously intolerant legislation contradicted the spirit of toleration that had emerged after 1688 and suggested that she placed Anglican interests above national harmony.

Anne's handling of the succession crisis in her final years has been heavily criticized. Despite the Act of Settlement designating the Hanoverian succession, Anne maintained correspondence with her Catholic half-brother James Francis Edward Stuart (the "Old Pretender") and seemed at times to consider him as a possible successor if he would convert to Protestantism[^44]. This flirtation with reversing the Protestant succession created enormous political uncertainty and encouraged Jacobite hopes. While Anne ultimately did nothing to alter the settlement, her ambiguity on this crucial question destabilized politics and raised doubts about her commitment to the principles of the Glorious Revolution[^45].

Some historians have argued that Anne's frequent illnesses and physical decline made her increasingly unable to fulfill her duties effectively, particularly in her final years[^46]. She became morbidly obese, had difficulty walking, and suffered from severe pain that may have affected her judgment. Critics suggested that a more capable monarch might have managed political conflicts more effectively and prevented some of the instability that characterized the later part of her reign. The question of whether her physical condition rendered her unfit to rule raised uncomfortable constitutional questions that were not fully addressed.

## Personal Life

Anne's personal life was dominated by two relationships: her marriage to Prince George of Denmark and her intense friendship with Sarah Churchill. Her marriage to George, arranged for political reasons, developed into a genuine affectionate partnership, though George played no significant political role[^47]. Contemporary accounts describe George as amiable but dull, with King Charles II reportedly joking that he had tried George drunk and sober and could find nothing in him. Nevertheless, Anne was devoted to him, and his death in 1708 left her devastated[^48]. Their relationship was characterized by mutual support through the repeated tragedies of losing child after child, a shared grief that bonded them together.

The greatest tragedy of Anne's life was her inability to produce a surviving heir despite at least seventeen pregnancies[^49]. She suffered multiple miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths that took a terrible physical and emotional toll. Her longest-surviving child, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester, showed promise but died of what was probably pneumonia at age eleven in 1700[^50]. Modern medical historians have speculated that Anne may have suffered from antiphospholipid syndrome, a condition that can cause recurrent pregnancy loss, or that the frequent pregnancies themselves, combined with her other health problems, created a vicious cycle of physical decline[^51]. These obstetric tragedies shaped Anne's personality, making her more fatalistic and deeply religious, but also more emotionally vulnerable to the influence of strong personalities like Sarah Churchill.

Anne's friendship with Sarah Churchill was one of the most intense and politically significant personal relationships in British royal history[^52]. The two women had known each other since childhood and developed an intimate friendship in which they addressed each other by the pet names "Mrs. Morley" (Anne) and "Mrs. Freeman" (Sarah), abandoning formal titles to emphasize their equality and closeness[^53]. Sarah was intelligent, passionate, and politically engaged in ways that Anne was not, and for many years she served as Anne's closest confidante and advisor. However, the relationship became increasingly strained as Sarah attempted to dominate Anne politically and personally, lecturing her on policy matters and berating her for insufficient commitment to Whig principles[^54]. The friendship finally ruptured in 1710 in a series of bitter confrontations, leaving Anne feeling betrayed and Sarah consumed with rage at her loss of influence.

Sarah's replacement in Anne's affections by Abigail Masham, Sarah's own cousin, added a note of personal betrayal to the political transition[^55]. Abigail was gentler and more compliant than Sarah, offering Anne the uncritical emotional support she craved rather than political lectures. Some contemporary rumors suggested that Anne's relationships with Sarah and Abigail were lesbian in nature, though there is no conclusive evidence for this and such relationships may simply have reflected the intense emotional friendships common among women of the period[^56]. Regardless of their exact nature, these relationships clearly satisfied deep emotional needs in Anne that her marriage, however affectionate, did not fully address.

Anne's personality was characterized by stubbornness, piety, and a desire to do her duty as she understood it[^57]. She was not an intellectual and reportedly found abstract political and theological discussions tedious, preferring concrete moral and religious principles. She attended church services regularly and took her religious obligations seriously, seeing herself as a defender of the Church of England against both Catholic and dissenting threats[^58]. Those who knew her described her as kind-hearted and generous to individuals, though capable of surprising stubbornness when her principles or preferences were challenged. She had a well-developed, if conventional, sense of royal dignity and became annoyed when treated with insufficient respect.

In her later years, Anne's life was increasingly constrained by her deteriorating health. She suffered from obesity that made it difficult for her to walk, requiring her to be carried to state occasions[^59]. She experienced severe pain from what was described as gout, though the exact nature of her ailments remains debated by medical historians. Contemporary descriptions suggest she also suffered from erysipelas (a bacterial skin infection) and possible edema[^60]. These physical problems made her final years a period of considerable suffering, and she faced death with the same pious resignation that had characterized her response to earlier tragedies.

## Legacy

Queen Anne's most enduring legacy is the United Kingdom itself. The Acts of Union 1707, which created the Kingdom of Great Britain, fundamentally reshaped the British Isles and created the political entity that would go on to build a global empire[^61]. While the union faced resistance, particularly in Scotland, and has been periodically challenged, it has endured for more than three centuries. Anne's personal commitment to achieving this union and her willingness to expend political capital on it was crucial to its success[^62]. In this sense, she can be considered one of the most consequential British monarchs, even if her personal abilities were not exceptional.

The territorial and commercial gains secured during Anne's reign laid the foundation for British imperial and commercial expansion in the eighteenth century[^63]. Gibraltar, Minorca, and the North American territories acquired through the Treaty of Utrecht became crucial to British strategic and economic interests. The slave trade concessions, while morally reprehensible, contributed to British commercial prosperity and the development of a plantation economy in the Caribbean[^64]. These acquisitions positioned Britain to become the dominant global power by the end of the eighteenth century.

Anne was the last monarch of the Stuart dynasty, a family that had ruled Scotland since 1371 and England since 1603[^65]. Her death without surviving issue led to the Hanoverian succession and a new dynasty with a different relationship to Parliament and the constitution. The Stuart cause became a romantic lost cause, with Jacobite rebellions attempting to restore the Stuart line in 1715, 1719, and 1745, all ultimately unsuccessful[^66]. Anne's reign thus marked the end of an era in British monarchical history and the beginning of a new constitutional arrangement in which royal power would continue to decline relative to Parliament.

The cultural and literary flowering of Anne's reign, sometimes called the "Augustan Age," left a lasting mark on English literature and culture[^67]. The works of Swift, Pope, Addison, Steele, and others produced during this period became canonical texts of English literature. The development of periodical literature and coffee-house culture created new forms of public discourse that contributed to the development of the public sphere and civil society[^68]. While Anne herself was not directly responsible for these developments, her reign provided the political stability (despite its factional conflicts) within which such cultural achievements could flourish.

Anne's reign marked an important stage in the development of British parliamentary government and the party system[^69]. The competition between Whigs and Tories became more institutionalized, and the practice of appointing ministries from the party with parliamentary majority support became more established, though this process would not be complete until the nineteenth century. Anne was the last British monarch to veto parliamentary legislation (in 1708), and subsequent monarchs would increasingly accept the principle that they must work with, rather than against, parliamentary majorities[^70].

The architectural legacy of Anne's reign includes the "Queen Anne style" churches and the development of English Baroque architecture[^71]. The work of architects such as Christopher Wren, Nicholas Hawksmoor, and John Vanbrugh flourished during this period, producing buildings that remain landmarks of British architectural history. Blenheim Palace, built as a gift from a grateful nation to the Duke of Marlborough, stands as a monument to the military triumphs of Anne's reign[^72].

Anne's reputation among later generations has fluctuated considerably. Victorian historians often dismissed her as a weak, insignificant monarch dominated by favorites[^73]. Twentieth-century historians have generally been more sympathetic, recognizing her genuine political engagement and the significant achievements of her reign while acknowledging her limitations[^74]. Recent scholarship, particularly since the 2018 film "The Favourite," has renewed popular interest in Anne and encouraged more nuanced assessments of her personality and political role[^75].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Sympathetic historians have emphasized that Anne was a more capable and engaged monarch than many contemporaries acknowledged. Edward Gregg, author of a major modern biography, argues that Anne "was not a great queen, but she was a good one" who took her duties seriously and exercised real political judgment[^76]. She actively participated in cabinet meetings, made her own decisions about ministerial appointments, and had clear political preferences that she pursued with considerable determination. Her achievement in securing the union with Scotland demonstrated genuine political skill and persistence[^77].

Defenders of Anne point out that she faced extraordinarily difficult circumstances, including chronic ill health, the repeated trauma of losing all her children, and the challenge of managing intensely hostile political factions[^78]. Despite these obstacles, she maintained her commitment to her constitutional duties and never entirely abdicated her political responsibilities to favorites or ministers, even when her health made active governance difficult. Her determination to continue performing her royal functions despite severe physical disabilities shows considerable courage and dedication.

Some historians have praised Anne's genuine piety and her commitment to the Church of England as representing authentic religious conviction rather than mere political calculation[^79]. Her establishment of Queen Anne's Bounty demonstrated real concern for the welfare of poor clergy and the health of the church. In an age when religious issues remained central to political life, Anne's strong Anglican identity provided stability and continuity, reassuring those who feared both Catholic restoration and further Protestant radicalism[^80].

Anne's patronage of the arts and her maintenance of a culturally vibrant court contributed to the Augustan Age's achievements[^81]. While not an intellectual herself, she recognized and supported talent, providing an environment in which literary and artistic culture could flourish. Her court was less morally scandalous than those of some of her Stuart predecessors, reflecting her own more conventional moral values.

Recent feminist historical scholarship has reconsidered Anne more sympathetically, seeing her intense female friendships as reflecting authentic emotional needs and resisting earlier dismissals of her as weak or dominated[^82]. These scholars argue that Anne's exercise of queenship, while different from male models of kingship, represented a legitimate form of political authority that has been undervalued because of gender bias in historical assessment. Her ability to navigate the male-dominated world of early eighteenth-century politics while maintaining her own preferences and principles deserves more credit than it has traditionally received.

Military historians credit Anne with consistently supporting the war effort against France during the crucial early years of the War of the Spanish Succession, enabling Marlborough's brilliant campaigns[^83]. Her personal relationship with Sarah Churchill, while later fractious, initially facilitated the partnership between crown and commander that produced such spectacular victories. The Treaty of Utrecht, despite contemporary Whig criticism, secured substantial British gains and established a more stable European balance of power[^84].

---

### Negative Views

Critics of Anne have consistently pointed to her limited intellectual capacity and lack of political vision as fundamental weaknesses[^85]. Unlike Elizabeth I, who could match wits with her advisors, or William III, who had a sophisticated grasp of European politics, Anne reportedly found complex political and diplomatic matters tedious and difficult to grasp. Sarah Churchill, who knew her intimately, described her as "ignorant" and "obstinate," unable to understand sophisticated arguments but stubbornly committed to her prejudices[^86]. This intellectual limitation, critics argue, made her dependent on advisors and favorites whose own agendas often prevailed over national interest.

Many historians have condemned Anne's treatment of the Duke of Marlborough as disgraceful ingratitude[^87]. Marlborough had won unprecedented victories for Britain, establishing its military reputation and securing crucial territorial gains, yet Anne dismissed him in 1711 largely due to personal resentment of his wife Sarah and Tory political pressure. This shabby treatment of Britain's greatest general represented a triumph of petty personal grievances over proper recognition of extraordinary service[^88]. The Whig historian Lord Macaulay famously described Anne's reign as one in which "a woman of narrow understanding and weak spirit" allowed favorites to determine policy[^89].

Anne's religious intolerance and support for High Church Anglican persecution of dissenters has been strongly criticized as both morally wrong and politically foolish[^90]. The Occasional Conformity Act and Schism Act served no useful purpose and alienated Protestant dissenters who had been loyal supporters of the Revolution of 1688 and the Protestant succession. This religious bigotry suggested that Anne had learned nothing from her father's disastrous attempts to impose religious uniformity and showed a narrow sectarian spirit unworthy of a national monarch[^91].

The political instability of Anne's reign, with frequent changes of ministry and policy reversals driven by personal favoritism rather than principle, has been seen as damaging to effective government[^92]. The dramatic shift from Whig war policy to Tory peace policy in 1710-1713 created constitutional tension and international uncertainty. Anne's inability to maintain stable ministries or rise above faction contributed to a sense of government by intrigue rather than coherent policy[^93].

Some historians have questioned whether Anne's poor health in her final years rendered her effectively incapable of ruling, raising troubling questions about who was actually making decisions[^94]. If she was mentally or physically unable to fulfill her duties, some mechanism should have existed to address this, but the constitution provided no clear answer. The possibility that major decisions were being made by a monarch of diminished capacity is constitutionally problematic.

Anne's ambiguous attitude toward the succession and her flirtation with Jacobite possibilities has been condemned as irresponsible and potentially catastrophic[^95]. By maintaining contact with her half-brother and not unequivocally endorsing the Hanoverian succession, she encouraged false hopes among Jacobites and created unnecessary political uncertainty. A Catholic restoration would have reversed the Glorious Revolution and potentially plunged Britain into civil war; Anne's failure to firmly close this possibility showed poor judgment[^96].

Critics have also pointed to Anne's lack of personal charisma and inability to inspire loyalty beyond narrow circles[^97]. Unlike Elizabeth I, who crafted a powerful public image, or even Charles II, who charmed through personality, Anne never developed an effective public presence. Her physical disabilities made public appearances difficult, and she lacked the rhetorical skills or personal magnetism to command affection or respect. This absence of charismatic authority weakened the monarchy as an institution at a crucial period of constitutional development[^98].
