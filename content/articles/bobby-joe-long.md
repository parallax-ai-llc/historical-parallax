## Summary
Bobby Joe Long was an American serial killer and rapist who operated in the Tampa Bay area of Florida in 1984. He is known for abducting women, sexually assaulting them, and killing at least 10 victims during an eight-month span.

Long was arrested in November 1984 after the kidnapping and rape of a teenage victim who survived and provided investigators with identifying information. He was later sentenced to death in Florida and was executed by lethal injection in 2019.

## Background
Public reporting describes Long as having been born in West Virginia and later relocating to Florida. Some sources also discuss medical and family-history factors during his upbringing; these points are often presented as context but do not explain or justify his crimes.

In public summaries of the case, Long is often described as having lived and worked in the Tampa Bay region prior to the 1984 attacks. Contemporary reporting and later case overviews emphasize that the victims were largely targeted in ordinary settings such as roadways and parking areas.

## Crimes (1984)
Authorities linked Long to a series of abductions and sexual assaults in the Tampa Bay region. In multiple cases, victims were murdered, commonly by strangulation, after being assaulted.

Counts and classifications vary by jurisdiction and by what was proven in court versus attributed through investigation. Common summaries attribute at least 10 murders to Long during 1984.

### Victims and Attribution (High-Level)
Public databases and secondary sources sometimes differ on:
- which deaths are formally “cleared” by conviction,
- which incidents are attributed based on investigative findings,
- and which cases remain discussed as possible connections.

When reviewing the case, it is important to distinguish between (a) convictions in court and (b) broader investigative attribution reported by law enforcement or later historians.

### Modus Operandi (General)
High-level descriptions typically note:
- abduction of victims in the Tampa Bay area,
- sexual assault,
- and homicide following the assault (in the cases attributed as murders).

Specific details vary by incident and are often summarized differently across sources.

## Investigation and Arrest
A major break in the case came after the abduction of a 17-year-old victim (widely reported as Lisa McVey) who was held for many hours and then released. She provided details about the offender and circumstances that helped police narrow suspects.

Forensic evidence—including fiber comparisons reported in major summaries of the case—was used to connect Long to multiple crime scenes and victims. He was arrested on November 16, 1984.

### Evidence and Case-Building
Public case overviews often highlight a combination of:
- survivor testimony,
- physical and trace evidence (commonly reported as fibers),
- investigative linkage across multiple incidents,
- and subsequent confessions/pleas in some proceedings.

As with many multi-victim cases, the “full picture” emerged over time through overlapping investigations rather than a single decisive clue.

## Prosecution, Sentencing, and Execution
Long faced charges across multiple incidents and jurisdictions. He received multiple life sentences and a death sentence in Florida for a first-degree murder conviction.

After decades of appeals, the State of Florida carried out the sentence. Long was executed by lethal injection on May 23, 2019.

### Legal Process (Overview)
Because the crimes involved multiple victims and occurred across a region, reporting often notes that Long’s legal outcomes included:
- proceedings for specific murders,
- additional cases addressed through pleas or separate sentences,
- and long-running post-conviction appeals typical of U.S. capital cases.

## Impact and Legacy
The case is frequently cited in discussions of:
- the importance of survivor accounts in violent-crime investigations,
- how corroborating forensic evidence can support multi-case linkage,
- and the long-term legal path of capital punishment cases in the United States.

The surviving victim’s role is often described in public accounts as central to identifying a suspect and enabling investigators to move quickly after the final abduction.
