## Summary
The Zodiac Killer operated in Northern California in the late 1960s-early 1970s, confirmed to have killed at least five people. He taunted police and newspapers with cryptic ciphers. Despite one of the largest investigations in California history, the case remains unsolved. One of his ciphers was finally decoded in 2020.

## Early Life
The identity of the Zodiac Killer has never been established. Over 2,500 suspects have been investigated. Prominent suspects include Arthur Leigh Allen and Gary Francis Poste. The case remains open. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Confirmed attacks began December 20, 1968, with the shooting of David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen. He struck again in July and September 1969, and murdered taxi driver Paul Stine in October 1969. He sent coded letters to Bay Area newspapers, only some of which have been deciphered. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
The Zodiac was never caught. His letters continued until 1974. In 2020, amateur codebreakers solved the '340 cipher.' DNA and fingerprint evidence has been preserved, and genetic genealogy offers hope for identification. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Drove advances in cryptanalysis [^4]
- Improved inter-agency law enforcement cooperation
- 2020 cipher decoding demonstrated citizen involvement value

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered at least five people [^5]
- Terrorized the Bay Area with threats of mass violence
- Claimed 37 murders
- Consumed vast law enforcement resources
- Evasion has frustrated families for over 50 years
