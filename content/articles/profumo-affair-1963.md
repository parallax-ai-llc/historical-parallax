## Overview

In 1961, John Profumo, the British Secretary of State for War, had a brief sexual affair with a 19-year-old model named **Christine Keeler**.
The problem? Keeler was simultaneously sleeping with **Yevgeny Ivanov**, a Soviet naval attaché (and spy).
This raised the terrifying possibility of "pillow talk" leaking nuclear secrets to the Russians.
Profumo lied to the House of Commons, denying any "impropriety." When the truth came out in 1963, he was forced to resign in disgrace. The scandal shattered the image of the Conservative government and led to their defeat in 1964.

## The Key Figures

**Stephen Ward:** An osteopath and artist who introduced high-society men to young women. He was the scapegoat, charged with "living off immoral earnings." He committed suicide during his trial.
**Mandy Rice-Davies:** Keeler's friend. When told in court that Lord Astor denied sleeping with her, she famously quipped: *"Well he would, wouldn't he?"*

## Legacy

It marked the end of deference in British society. The aristocracy was shown to be reckless and hedonistic. It heralded the "Swinging Sixties."
Profumo spent the rest of his life working as a volunteer cleaning toilets at a charity (Toynbee Hall) to redeem himself, eventually earning a CBE.
