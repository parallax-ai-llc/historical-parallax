## Summary

Samuel Hahnemann founded homeopathy in the late 18th century, proposing the principle of 'like cures like' and developing the practice of diluting substances to create remedies. While homeopathy remains scientifically controversial, Hahnemann's insistence on careful observation and his rejection of harmful practices like bloodletting were progressive for his time.
