## Summary

Ernst Mach was an Austrian physicist and philosopher who made important contributions to optics, acoustics, and the philosophy of science. The Mach number, representing the ratio of speed to the speed of sound, is named after him. His philosophical critique of Newtonian absolute space and time influenced Einstein's development of relativity. He pioneered the use of photography in studying supersonic phenomena.
