## Summary

Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist, engineer, and inventor who held 355 patents, most famously for dynamite. He invented dynamite in 1867, providing a safer alternative to nitroglycerin for mining and construction. After reading a premature obituary condemning him as a 'merchant of death,' he established the Nobel Prizes in his will. The Nobel Prizes remain the most prestigious awards in science, literature, and peace.
