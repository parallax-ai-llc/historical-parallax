## Summary

Rabi'a al-Adawiyya was an early Muslim mystic and saint who is considered the founder of the concept of Divine Love (al-hubb al-ilahi) in Sufism. Born into poverty and reportedly sold into slavery, she later became one of the most revered figures in Islamic mysticism. She emphasized disinterested love of God — loving God for God's sake, not out of fear of hell or desire for paradise. Her teachings profoundly influenced the entire Sufi tradition.
