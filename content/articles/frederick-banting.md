## Summary

Frederick Banting was a Canadian medical scientist who co-discovered insulin in 1921 with Charles Best, revolutionizing the treatment of diabetes. He received the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, becoming the youngest Nobel laureate in that category at the time. Banting shared his prize money with Best, who was excluded from the award. He sold the insulin patent for $1, believing it should be available to all.
