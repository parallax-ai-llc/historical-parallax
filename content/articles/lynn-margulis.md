## Summary

Lynn Margulis was an American biologist who revolutionized understanding of evolution through her endosymbiotic theory. She proposed that mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells originated as free-living bacteria that were incorporated into host cells through endosymbiosis. Initially controversial, her theory is now widely accepted. She also contributed to the Gaia hypothesis with James Lovelock.
