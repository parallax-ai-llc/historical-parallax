## Summary

Taejo (born November 4, 1335; died June 27, 1408), born **Yi Seong-gye**, was the founder and 1st King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1392 to 1398.[^1] Originally a brilliant military general of the crumbling Goryeo Dynasty, he rose to fame by repelling the Red Turbans, Mongols, and Japanese pirates. In 1388, he staged a coup during the **Wihwado Retreat**, turning his army back from a suicidal invasion of China to seize control of the government. He overthrew the Goryeo reforms and founded Joseon, establishing **Neo-Confucianism** as the state ideology and moving the capital to **Hanyang** (Seoul).[^2]

## From General to King

*   **Military Hero:** Yi Seong-gye was undefeated on the battlefield, a legend for his archery and leadership. He saved Goryeo from multiple foreign invasions.
*   **Wihwado Retreat (1388):** Ordered to invade the Ming Dynasty's Liaodong peninsula (an order he opposed), he famously turned his army around at Wihwa Island on the Yalu River. He marched back to the capital, deposed the King, and executed his rival General Choe Yeong.[^3]

## Founding of Joseon (1392)

With the help of radical reformist scholars like **Jeong Do-jeon**, he ascended the throne in 1392.
*   **New Capital:** He moved the capital from Kaesong (a Buddhist stronghold) to Hanyang (Seoul), laying out the city's palaces (Gyeongbokgung) and gates based on Confucian principles.
*   **Neo-Confucianism:** He aggressively promoted Neo-Confucianism to replace the corrupt Buddhist establishment of Goryeo.[^4]

## Tragic Later Years

His final years were heartbroken by the **Strife of Princes**.
*   **Succession Crisis:** He favored his youngest son (by his second wife) as Crown Prince. This enraged his ambitious fifth son, **Yi Bang-won** (Taejong), who had done the most to help him become King.
*   **Abdication:** After Yi Bang-won killed the Crown Prince and Jeong Do-jeon in 1398, Taejo abdicated in disgust and retired to his hometown Hamhung. The phrase "Hamhung Chasa" (King's messenger to Hamhung who never returns) comes from this period, referring to his refusal to reconcile with his son.[^5]
