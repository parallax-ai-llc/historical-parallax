## Summary

On October 17, 2019, the Lebanese government announced a tax on WhatsApp calls—and Lebanon exploded. What began as outrage over a $6/month fee became the largest protests in the country's modern history. Hundreds of thousands filled the streets of Beirut, Tripoli, Sidon, and towns across sectarian lines, demanding not just the tax's reversal but the fall of the entire political system that had driven Lebanon to ruin.[^1]

For the first time since the 1975-1990 civil war, Lebanese from all sects—Sunni, Shia, Christian, Druze—united in anger against "le système": the power-sharing arrangement that had enriched warlords-turned-politicians while delivering failing electricity, uncollected garbage, and a collapsing economy. Protesters chanted "Kellon yaani kellon" (All of them means all of them) and blocked roads with festive defiance. Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigned on October 29.[^2]

But the system held. No meaningful reform followed. Then, on August 4, 2020, 2,750 tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate exploded at Beirut's port—killing 218, injuring 7,000, and displacing 300,000 in one of history's largest non-nuclear explosions. The blast symbolized everything protesters had denounced: corruption, negligence, impunity. Lebanon's ruling class, however, remained. Today the country suffers one of the world's worst economic collapses: the currency has lost 98% of its value, poverty has surged from 28% to over 80%, and the same leaders who created the crisis remain in power.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Sectarian System

Lebanon's political system (since 1943 and reinforced after 1990):

- **President:** Maronite Christian
- **Prime Minister:** Sunni Muslim
- **Parliament Speaker:** Shia Muslim
- Parliamentary seats divided by confession
- Power-sharing became power among warlords

The system was meant to prevent civil war; instead it entrenched corruption.[^4]

### Post-Civil War Lebanon

After the 1975-1990 civil war:

- Warlords became politicians
- Rafik Hariri-era reconstruction: debt-fueled, benefiting oligarchs
- Hezbollah maintained independent military
- Syrian occupation until 2005
- 2006 war with Israel devastated infrastructure

By 2019, public debt reached 150% of GDP—one of the world's highest.[^5]

### Economic Crisis

Lebanon's economy was already failing before protests:

- Banking sector: Ponzi-like dollar inflows sustained system
- Government services failing (electricity, water, garbage)
- Youth unemployment high
- Dollar shortages appeared summer 2019
- Credit rating downgraded

The rot was visible; the trigger was awaited.[^6]

## The October Revolution

### The Spark (October 17, 2019)

**October 17:** Government announced taxes, including:

- WhatsApp calls: $6/month
- Fuel, tobacco increases

Within hours, protests erupted:

- Roads blocked with burning tires
- Crowds gathered in Beirut and across the country
- Government withdrew WhatsApp tax within hours—but it was too late

The tax was "the last straw."[^7]

### Mass Mobilization

**October 17-November 2019:** Protests peaked

- Hundreds of thousands in streets
- Martyrs' Square and Riad al-Solh in Beirut central
- Cross-sectarian: Shia areas (Nabatieh, Tyre), Sunni areas (Tripoli), Christian areas (Batroun)—all protested

**Key features:**

- Festive atmosphere; music; art
- "Revolution tourism"
- Women prominent
- Rejection of all parties—including Hezbollah, despite its power

**Slogans:**

- "Kellon yaani kellon" (All of them means all of them)
- "Thawra!" (Revolution!)
- "The people want the fall of the regime"[^8]

### Hariri's Resignation

**October 29, 2019:** Prime Minister Saad Hariri announced resignation, saying he had reached a "dead end."

But forming a new government proved impossible amid political paralysis.[^9]

### Violence and Counter-Mobilization

- **November 2019:** Hezbollah and Amal supporters attacked protest camps
- Security forces used tear gas and rubber bullets
- Several deaths; hundreds injured
- Protesters largely maintained nonviolence despite provocations[^10]

---

## The Aftermath

### Political Paralysis

- Protests continued sporadically through early 2020
- New government under Hassan Diab (January 2020)—seen as Hezbollah-aligned
- No real reform

### Economic Collapse

Lebanon experienced one of history's worst economic crises:

- **March 2020:** Sovereign debt default
- **Currency collapse:** Lebanese pound fell from 1,500/$1 to 100,000+/$1
- **Bank restrictions:** Informal capital controls trapped deposits
- **Hyperinflation:** 221% in 2023
- **Poverty:** Surged from 28% (2019) to 80%+ (2021)
- **Emigration:** Massive brain drain[^11]

### COVID-19

The pandemic compounded economic devastation and halted mass protests.

### Beirut Explosion (August 4, 2020)

At 6:07 PM on August 4, 2020:

- 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored at port since 2014 exploded
- One of the largest non-nuclear explosions in history
- **218 killed; 7,000+ injured; 300,000 displaced**
- Port destroyed; half of Beirut damaged
- Damage: $15+ billion

**Cause:** Negligence. Multiple officials knew of the danger and did nothing.

**Consequences:**

- Protests erupted; government resigned (August 10)
- No accountability—investigation obstructed
- Same political class remained[^12]

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Historic Moment:** October 2019 broke the sectarian barrier. For the first time, Lebanese from all communities united to reject the entire political class—including parties they had traditionally supported. The slogan "All of them means all of them" targeted everyone, Hezbollah included. This represented a fundamental rejection of the post-civil war order.[^14]

**Unfulfilled Promise:** The revolution achieved Hariri's resignation but not systemic change. The same leaders remain. The explosion killed hundreds, yet no one has been held accountable. Lebanon collapsed—economically, socially, institutionally—while the political class maintained power.

### Elite Perspective

**Regime Narrative:** Leaders blamed external factors (sanctions, regional instability, COVID) for the crisis. Some portrayed protests as foreign-backed destabilization. Hezbollah argued its resistance priority superseded internal reform.

### Critical Analysis

**Structural Obstacles:** Lebanon's sectarian system is self-reinforcing: each community fears losing power to others. External actors (Iran, Saudi Arabia, foreign creditors) have vested interests. The political class controlled banks where savings were trapped—hostages of the system they created.

**Explosion as Metaphor:** The port blast was a literal explosion of state failure—years of warnings ignored, negligence protected, and after the catastrophe, impunity. It encapsulates everything the revolution diagnosed.[^15]

## Legacy

### For Lebanon

- Economic collapse ongoing
- Emigration accelerating
- Political deadlock persistent
- October 17 commemorated but not celebrated
- Beirut explosion anniversary marked with grief and anger

### For the Region

- Connected to 2019 global protest wave
- Showed even armed-party-dominated systems vulnerable to mass mobilization
- But also showed limits when external powers and armed groups block change

### Questions Remaining

- Can Lebanon recover without fundamental reform?
- Will the diaspora return if the system changes?
- Is the sectarian power-sharing system reformable?[^16]
