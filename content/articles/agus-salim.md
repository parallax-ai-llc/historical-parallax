## Summary

Haji Agus Salim (1884-1954) was one of Indonesia's founding fathers and most distinguished diplomats, serving as Foreign Minister from 1947 to 1949 during the crucial independence struggle. Born Masjhoedoelhaq Salim in West Sumatra, he mastered nine languages and earned the honorific title "The Grand Old Man" for his exceptional diplomatic skills and intellectual depth. His historic achievement of securing Egypt as the first nation to recognize Indonesian independence in 1947 paved the way for international legitimacy, and his eloquent speeches at the United Nations Security Council galvanized global support against Dutch colonialism. Posthumously declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 1961, Salim's legacy endures as a polyglot statesman who combined Islamic scholarship, nationalist fervor, and diplomatic brilliance to help birth a nation.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Haji Agus Salim was born on October 8, 1884, in Koto Gadang, a small village in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, within the Minangkabau heartland.[^3] Born as Masjhoedoelhaq Salim—a name translating to "defender of truth"—he was raised in a distinguished family that straddled the worlds of traditional Islamic scholarship and Dutch colonial administration. His father, Sultan Mohammad Salim (also known as Soetan Mohamad Salim), served as chief prosecutor and later chief judge for the indigenous court in Tanjung Pinang, representing the highest rank a native could achieve in the colonial legal system.[^4] His mother, Siti Zainab, was renowned for her strong moral principles and religious devotion, instilling in young Agus a deep commitment to Islamic values.[^5]

The young Salim's exceptional intellect became evident early in his education. At a time when native children were systematically excluded from European schools, his father successfully petitioned colonial authorities to grant his two sons, Agus and Jacob, equal status with Europeans, allowing them to attend the Europeesche Lagere School (European Elementary School)—a rare privilege that marked the family's elite status within colonial society.[^6] Salim thrived in this environment, demonstrating an extraordinary aptitude for languages that would become his trademark. By his teenage years, he had already mastered seven foreign languages: Dutch, English, Arabic, Turkish, French, Japanese, and German—a linguistic arsenal that would prove invaluable in his future diplomatic career.[^7]

After completing primary education in West Sumatra, Salim continued his studies at the prestigious Hogere Burgerschool (Higher Civic School) in Batavia (now Jakarta), the colonial capital. He graduated with the highest score in the entire Dutch East Indies in 1903, an achievement that should have opened doors to higher education in the Netherlands.[^8] Salim harbored ambitions to study medicine in the Netherlands, but his application for a government scholarship was rejected by colonial authorities. In a remarkable gesture of solidarity, Raden Ajeng Kartini—the famous Javanese women's rights advocate—offered to defer her own scholarship so Salim could study abroad. The colonial government rejected this proposal as well, revealing the racial barriers that even exceptional native students faced.[^9] This early disappointment with colonial limitations would shape Salim's later nationalist convictions.

Unable to pursue medical studies in Europe, Salim entered the colonial bureaucracy, but his path would soon take an unexpected turn toward the Islamic world and Middle Eastern politics, experiences that would profoundly influence his worldview and diplomatic philosophy.[^10]

## Rise to Power

Agus Salim's rise to prominence began not in the political arena but in the cosmopolitan environment of the Arabian Peninsula. In 1905, the renowned Dutch orientalist and colonial advisor Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje—impressed by Salim's linguistic abilities and intellect—arranged for him to work as an interpreter and secretary at the Dutch consulate in Jeddah, where he handled affairs related to the annual hajj pilgrimage.[^11] From 1906 to 1911, Salim immersed himself in the heart of the Islamic world, developing fluency in classical Arabic and gaining intimate knowledge of Middle Eastern politics, Islamic reform movements, and the pan-Islamic currents that were sweeping across the Muslim world.[^12] This experience proved invaluable decades later when he would need to secure diplomatic recognition from Arab states for the fledgling Indonesian republic.

Returning to the Dutch East Indies in 1911, Salim embarked on a journalism career that would establish him as one of the most articulate voices of the nationalist movement. In 1915, he made a momentous decision that would define his political trajectory: he joined Sarekat Islam (Islamic Association), the largest and most influential mass organization in the colony, under the charismatic leadership of Oemar Said Tjokroaminoto.[^13] Salim quickly rose to become Tjokroaminoto's right-hand man, and the two became known as the "dwi tunggal" (the two who are one) due to their close cooperation and complementary skills—Tjokroaminoto provided the charisma and mass appeal, while Salim contributed intellectual rigor and strategic thinking.[^14]

From 1916 to 1920, Salim served as editor-in-chief of Neratja, a newspaper originally co-founded by him and Raden Djojosoediro, both members of Sarekat Islam.[^15] Initially partly funded by the Dutch colonial government under Governor-General Johan Paul van Limburg Stirum—who hoped to support a Malay-language forum sympathetic to the Dutch Ethical Policy—Neratja soon transformed into a fierce critic of colonialism under Salim's editorship.[^16] By 1918, the newspaper regularly printed exposés of the mistreatment of Muslims in remote regions of the Indies, earning condemnation from colonial authorities. His iconic declaration—"Indonesia is not a colony, but a colonized nation"—articulated a revolutionary distinction that challenged the very legitimacy of Dutch rule.[^17]

In 1921, Salim was appointed to the Volksraad, the Indies' mainly symbolic and advisory quasi-legislature, representing Sarekat Islam.[^18] Despite being a proficient speaker of Dutch, he made the radical decision to deliver all his speeches in Malay, becoming the first member of the council to do so despite hostile reception from European members.[^19] This deliberate linguistic choice was both symbolic and political—an assertion that Indonesians would speak to their colonizers in their own language, not merely as subjects adopting the master's tongue.

Salim played a crucial role in ideological battles within Sarekat Islam during the early 1920s. As communist elements increasingly infiltrated the organization, Salim and fellow religious leaders Abdul Muis urged a motion, passed at the 1921 national party congress, prohibiting dual party membership—effectively expelling communist members.[^20] After 1923, the organization came increasingly under Salim's control, and he directed it away from confrontational political activity toward Islamic reform and the pan-Islamic movement.[^21] His opposition to the messianic cult that had grown around Tjokroaminoto led to a de-emphasis of mystical elements and a shift toward pragmatic political action.[^22]

Unlike most future Republican leaders, Salim was never arrested or exiled by the Dutch—a fact that generated both respect and suspicion. His vast connections with the colonial bureaucracy and persistent rumors about possible early cooperation with the Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst (PID), the colonial intelligence service, dogged him throughout his career.[^23] Historian Allan Akbar notes that Salim was allegedly asked to covertly investigate Sarekat Islam's relationship with the Germans during World War I, but after six weeks of investigation, he decided to genuinely join the organization of his own will.[^24]

## Major Achievements

Agus Salim's most significant achievements came during Indonesia's independence struggle and the early years of the Republic, when his diplomatic genius proved indispensable to the nation's survival. His fluency in multiple languages, deep understanding of international politics, and ability to navigate complex negotiations made him the natural choice to represent Indonesian interests on the world stage.

The first critical test of Salim's diplomatic skills came on October 23, 1945, just two months after Indonesia's proclamation of independence. He represented Indonesia in initial negotiations with the Netherlands, articulating a legal argument that would become central to the Republic's position: Indonesia was no longer part of the Dutch Kingdom because the Netherlands had surrendered to Japan in 1942, thereby forfeiting any claim to sovereignty over the Indies.[^25] This argument challenged the Dutch attempt to simply resume colonial control after Japan's defeat.

In March 1947, Salim embarked on what would become his most celebrated diplomatic mission. Leading a small delegation consisting of Abdurrahman Baswedan, Rasjidi, and Nazir Sutan Pamuncak, he traveled to the Middle East to seek diplomatic recognition from Arab states—recognition that would bolster Indonesia's international legitimacy and pressure the Dutch.[^26] As a fluent speaker of classical (fusha) Arabic who had worked in Jeddah decades earlier, Salim possessed unique credentials. He met with Mahmoud El Nokrashy Pasha, the Egyptian Prime Minister, and Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam, the Secretary-General of the Arab League, arguing that Muslim solidarity should compel Arab nations to support Indonesia's independence struggle.[^27]

The mission achieved spectacular success. On June 10, 1947, Egypt became the first nation in the world to recognize Indonesian independence—a strategic breakthrough of immense psychological and diplomatic significance.[^28] Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen soon followed, providing the young republic with crucial international legitimacy at a time when most Western powers supported Dutch colonial restoration.[^29] For three months, Salim and his delegation successfully gained diplomatic recognition from almost all members of the Arab League, demonstrating that Indonesia could build alliances outside the Western sphere of influence.[^30]

On July 3, 1947, Salim was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Amir Sjarifuddin Cabinet, succeeding Sutan Sjahrir.[^31] His tenure, which extended through multiple cabinets until December 20, 1949, coincided with the most critical period of the independence struggle. When the Netherlands launched its First Military Action (Eerste Politionele Actie) in July 1947—a euphemistically named military assault that violated the Linggadjati Agreement—Salim led Indonesia's diplomatic counteroffensive.

On August 14, 1947, Salim led Indonesia's delegation at a United Nations Security Council session in Lake Success, New York.[^32] His performance was masterful. Through persuasive speeches delivered in flawless English and detailed evidence exposing Dutch aggression, Salim garnered international support for Indonesia's cause. He presented the conflict not as an internal colonial matter but as international aggression against a sovereign nation, successfully internationalizing the dispute and bringing it under UN jurisdiction. This diplomatic victory forced the Dutch to accept international mediation and prevented them from simply crushing the Republic through military force.

In 1949, Salim served as leader of the Indonesian delegation at the Round Table Conference in The Hague—the final negotiations that would result in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.[^33] In a symbolic gesture that captured his defiant nationalism, Salim reportedly smoked a kretek (Indonesian clove cigarette) during the proceedings, defiantly sharing the aroma of Indonesian sovereignty in the heart of the former colonial power.[^34] The conference concluded on November 2, 1949, with the Netherlands agreeing to transfer sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia on December 27, 1949—a diplomatic triumph to which Salim contributed significantly.[^35]

Beyond specific diplomatic missions, Salim played a leading role in the creation of the Indonesian constitution in 1945 as a member of the BPUPKI (Investigating Committee for the Preparation of Indonesian Independence).[^36] His Islamic scholarship and understanding of constitutional principles helped shape the philosophical foundations of the Indonesian state, particularly regarding the relationship between Islam and national identity.

Salim's diplomatic style earned him widespread admiration. His polyglot abilities allowed him to speak directly to foreign leaders in their own languages without interpreters. His sharp wit, intellectual depth, and negotiating charisma earned him the honorific title "The Grand Old Man" (Kamitua yang Mulia)—a testament to his stature among both Indonesian and foreign diplomats.[^37] Mohammad Roem, who succeeded Salim as Foreign Minister, described him as embodying the Dutch proverb "leiden is lijden" (leading is suffering)—a reference to Salim's selfless dedication and simple lifestyle despite his high office.[^38]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his celebrated achievements, Agus Salim's career was not without controversy. Persistent questions about his relationship with Dutch colonial authorities created an ambiguous legacy that some historians continue to debate.

The most significant controversy surrounds Salim's early career and possible connections to the Politieke Inlichtingen Dienst (PID), the Dutch East Indies' principal state security and intelligence service. According to historical accounts, Salim was allegedly asked by Datuak Tumangguang to covertly infiltrate Sarekat Islam to investigate the relationship between Tjokroaminoto and the Germans during World War I.[^39] While Salim apparently conducted such an investigation for about six weeks before deciding to genuinely join the organization, the allegation that he ever served as a colonial informant—even briefly—raised questions about his nationalist credentials.[^40]

The suspicious circumstance that Salim was never arrested or exiled by Dutch authorities—unlike virtually every other major nationalist leader—fueled speculation about special protection. Was this due to his vast connections within the colonial bureaucracy, as some suggested, or did it indicate ongoing cooperation with colonial intelligence?[^41] While no definitive evidence of sustained collaboration has been established, the question has never been fully resolved.

The Neratja newspaper episode also generated controversy. When the newspaper—co-founded by Salim and partly funded by the Dutch colonial government—published an editorial applauding the expulsion of Dutch communist Henk Sneevliet in 1918, other newspapers condemned the editors, forcing Salim and his colleagues to issue a public apology.[^42] Critics accused Neratja of serving Dutch interests by supporting the suppression of left-wing activists, highlighting the complex and sometimes contradictory positions Salim occupied while trying to navigate the treacherous political landscape of late colonial Indonesia.

Salim's role in the expulsion of communists from Sarekat Islam in 1921—while consistent with his Islamic religious principles—also attracted criticism from the left. The motion prohibiting dual party membership effectively purged the organization of its most radical elements, weakening the broader anti-colonial movement and contributing to the splintering of Indonesian nationalism along ideological lines.[^43] Critics argued that this divisive action benefited Dutch colonial rule by fragmenting Indonesian opposition.

After 1923, when Salim gained increasing control over Sarekat Islam, he deliberately directed the organization away from confrontational political activity toward Islamic reform and the pan-Islamic movement.[^44] Some nationalist activists viewed this shift as a retreat from the revolutionary struggle, arguing that Salim's intellectual approach and focus on cultural Islam diluted the movement's political militancy when direct confrontation with Dutch power was needed.

Salim's diplomatic achievements in securing recognition from Arab states, while celebrated, also had limitations. Some critics noted that recognition from relatively weak Middle Eastern countries, while symbolically important, did little to change the military realities on the ground where Dutch forces continued to attack the Republic. Furthermore, the Round Table Conference that Salim helped negotiate in 1949 contained significant compromises—including Dutch retention of Western New Guinea (Papua) and Indonesian assumption of Dutch colonial debts—that later generations of Indonesian nationalists would condemn as neo-colonial impositions.[^45]

His relationship with Islamic orthodoxy also created tensions. While Salim was deeply religious and an Islamic scholar, his modernist interpretation of Islam and his Western education sometimes put him at odds with more traditional ulama (religious scholars). His support for women's education and his statements about "the teachings and spirit of Islam pioneering women's emancipation" were progressive for his time but generated controversy among conservative religious circles.[^46]

Finally, Salim's simple lifestyle and refusal to enrich himself through political office—while admirable—also limited his political effectiveness in some ways. His lack of a strong political machine or personal following meant that his influence depended heavily on his intellectual and diplomatic skills rather than on institutional power, making his legacy more individual than institutional.

## Personal Life

Agus Salim married Zainatoen Nahar (née Almatsier), and together they raised a large family in a multilingual and intellectually stimulating household.[^47] Their children included Theodora Atia Sudiro (née Salim), Violet Hanifah Sjahroezah (née Salim), Achmad Sjewket Salim, Dolly Salim, Taufiq Salim, and Maria Zenobia Tanziel (née Salim).[^48]

Dolly, the eldest child, achieved her own place in Indonesian history as the first person to sing the lyrics of "Indonesia Raya" at the Second Youth Congress (Kongres Pemuda II) in 1928—the anthem that would later be adopted as the Republic's national anthem.[^49] Violet married Djohan Sjahroezah, a prominent socialist, underground anti-Japanese activist, and nephew of Sutan Sjahrir, Salim's revolutionary protégé and the Republic's first Prime Minister.[^50] These family connections illustrate how deeply the Salim family was embedded in Indonesia's nationalist networks.

Despite being a product of Dutch colonial schools and having benefited immensely from his European education, Salim and his wife made the radical decision not to send their children to Dutch colonial schools. Instead, they mostly homeschooled their children, teaching them in a multilingual environment that reflected Salim's belief in education freed from colonial indoctrination.[^51] This decision demonstrated Salim's commitment to creating a new generation of Indonesians who would be educated but not colonized in their thinking.

Salim was renowned for his frugality and remarkably simple lifestyle, especially considering his high government positions. Mohammad Roem, in an article for Prisma magazine, described Salim's lifestyle as a manifestation of the old Dutch proverb "leiden is lijden" (leading is suffering)—an ethic that viewed public service as a burden to be borne selflessly rather than an opportunity for personal enrichment.[^52] Unlike many political figures, Salim never accumulated wealth or lived ostentatiously. His modest home and simple dress became legendary among his contemporaries.

Personally, Salim was best remembered for his sharp wit and exceptional debating skills.[^53] He possessed a keen intellect combined with a sense of humor that could disarm opponents and charm allies. Anecdotes about his clever responses to challenges became part of Indonesian political folklore. His fluency in at least nine languages—Dutch, English, Arabic, Turkish, French, Japanese, German, Malay, and reportedly Spanish—made him a cosmopolitan intellectual who could engage with ideas from multiple cultural traditions.[^54]

Religious devotion formed the core of Salim's personal identity. His pilgrimage to Mecca and the honorific "Haji" that preceded his name reflected his deep Islamic faith. Yet his religiosity was tempered by intellectual sophistication and exposure to modernist Islamic reform movements he encountered during his years in Jeddah. He embodied a synthesis of Islamic piety, Western education, and Indonesian nationalism that was characteristic of the independence generation's most cosmopolitan figures.

Salim's personality combined intellectual brilliance with moral seriousness. He was known for his integrity and unwillingness to compromise his principles for personal gain—qualities that earned him respect even from political opponents. His saying "Memimpin adalah menderita" (To lead is to suffer) and "Leading is a trust, not a gift. Leading is sacrificing, not demanding" reflected his philosophy of leadership as service rather than power.[^55]

In his later years, Salim continued to be active in public affairs, though he gradually withdrew from formal government positions. He remained a respected elder statesman whose opinions carried weight in Indonesian political discourse. His house became a gathering place for intellectuals and politicians seeking his counsel.

## Legacy

Haji Agus Salim died on November 4, 1954, in Jakarta and was interred at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery, the burial ground reserved for Indonesia's most honored national figures.[^56] His death marked the end of an era—the passing of one of the last surviving founding fathers who had bridged the late colonial period, the Japanese occupation, the revolutionary struggle, and the early years of independence.

On December 27, 1961, President Soekarno posthumously conferred upon Salim the title of National Hero of Indonesia through Presidential Decree Number 657.[^57] This recognition cemented his place in the pantheon of Indonesian independence heroes, alongside figures like Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, Sutan Sjahrir, and others who sacrificed for national liberation.

Salim's legacy manifests in multiple dimensions of Indonesian national life. As a diplomat, he established Indonesia's tradition of independent foreign policy and demonstrated that a small, newly independent nation could punch above its weight through skillful diplomacy. His success in securing recognition from Arab states illustrated the potential of South-South solidarity and non-Western alliances—a strategy that would later become central to Indonesia's Non-Aligned Movement diplomacy during the Cold War.[^58]

His linguistic abilities and intellectual cosmopolitanism set a standard for Indonesian diplomacy. The Foreign Ministry that he helped establish continued to emphasize language skills and cultural sophistication as essential diplomatic tools. His example showed that effective representation of Indonesian interests required not just asserting sovereignty but engaging intellectually with the international community on equal terms.

As an Islamic intellectual, Salim demonstrated how Muslim identity could be integrated with nationalism without creating a theocratic state. His role in shaping Indonesia's philosophical foundations helped establish the model of Pancasila—the five principles that make Indonesia neither a secular state nor an Islamic state but something unique. His famous statement that "the teachings and spirit of Islam pioneered women's emancipation" represented a progressive interpretation that influenced later debates about Islam's role in Indonesian society.[^59]

Salim's journalistic legacy persists in Indonesia's tradition of politically engaged journalism. His transformation of Neratja from a government-funded publication into a fierce critic of colonialism established a precedent for journalistic independence and courage. His insistence on using Malay/Indonesian rather than Dutch in the Volksraad symbolized the linguistic nationalism that would eventually make Indonesian the national language—a unifying force in an ethnically and linguistically diverse archipelago.

Educational institutions, streets, and public facilities across Indonesia bear his name, particularly in West Sumatra, his birthplace. The Haji Agus Salim Stadium in Padang stands as a physical monument to his memory, though his intellectual legacy remains his most enduring monument.[^60]

In scholarly assessments, Salim occupies a unique position as one of the most intellectually sophisticated figures of Indonesia's independence generation. Unlike revolutionary firebrands or military leaders, Salim represented the power of ideas, words, and reasoned argument in the struggle for national liberation. His life demonstrated that colonialism could be challenged not only through armed resistance but also through intellectual superiority and diplomatic skill.

Contemporary Indonesia continues to grapple with issues that Salim addressed: the relationship between Islam and national identity, the balance between Western modernity and indigenous culture, the meaning of leadership as service rather than power, and the role of small nations in international affairs. His example of integrity, intellectual rigor, and selfless service remains relevant in an era when political leadership is often associated with corruption and self-enrichment.

Perhaps Salim's most enduring legacy is symbolic: he proved that Indonesia could produce world-class intellects and diplomats who could hold their own with anyone. In an age when colonial ideology insisted on the inferiority of colonized peoples, Salim's mastery of multiple languages, his diplomatic triumphs, and his intellectual brilliance demolished those racist assumptions and helped establish Indonesian confidence on the world stage.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and scholars who study Indonesian independence generally accord Agus Salim an honored place among the founding fathers. His diplomatic achievements are consistently praised as crucial to the Republic's survival during its most vulnerable period. Dr. Deliar Noer, a prominent Indonesian historian, emphasized Salim's role in articulating a modernist Islamic perspective that reconciled religious identity with nationalism, helping to forge a broad-based independence movement that included both secular and religious Indonesians.[^61]

International relations scholars highlight Salim's pioneering work in establishing Indonesia's non-aligned foreign policy orientation. His success in building diplomatic relationships with Middle Eastern countries demonstrated strategic imagination—recognizing that Indonesia's natural allies might be found in the Global South rather than among Western powers.[^62] This insight would later inform Indonesia's co-founding role in the Non-Aligned Movement and its leadership in Asian-African solidarity movements.

Linguistic and cultural historians celebrate Salim's insistence on using Indonesian/Malay in official proceedings. Benedict Anderson, the renowned scholar of Indonesian nationalism, noted how language policy was central to imagining the Indonesian nation, and Salim's Volksraad speeches in Malay represented an early assertion of linguistic sovereignty that prefigured Indonesia's language nationalism.[^63]

Islamic scholars and intellectuals within the modernist tradition claim Salim as an exemplar of progressive Islam compatible with modernity, education, and women's rights. Organizations like Muhammadiyah—of which Salim was an active member—view him as vindicating their approach to Islamic reform.[^64] His scholarly synthesis of Islamic principles with nationalist politics provided a model for Muslim intellectuals seeking to participate fully in modern political life without abandoning religious identity.

Diplomatic historians emphasize Salim's professionalism and skill. His performance at the United Nations, his negotiations with Arab leaders, and his role at the Round Table Conference are studied as masterclasses in diplomatic technique. His fluency in multiple languages, cultural sensitivity, and ability to frame arguments persuasively across different cultural contexts set standards for Indonesian diplomacy.[^65]

Biographers like Purwanto Setiadi have portrayed Salim as embodying the highest ideals of public service—intellectual brilliance combined with moral integrity, ambition for the nation rather than personal advancement, and a cosmopolitan outlook rooted in deep cultural identity.[^66] This hagiographic tradition emphasizes his simple lifestyle, his dedication to homeschooling his children to avoid colonial indoctrination, and his famous dictum that "leading is suffering."

### Negative Views

Critical historians have questioned aspects of Salim's legacy, particularly regarding his ambiguous relationship with Dutch colonial authorities. The persistent rumors about possible intelligence connections—even if they involved only brief cooperation before he fully committed to Sarekat Islam—have led some scholars to view him as a more compromised figure than the heroic narrative suggests.[^67] The fact that he alone among major nationalist leaders was never arrested or exiled raises questions about what accommodations he might have made with colonial power.

Leftist historians and scholars influenced by Marxist interpretations of Indonesian independence have criticized Salim's role in expelling communists from Sarekat Islam in 1921. They argue that this divisive action weakened the anti-colonial movement by fragmenting it along ideological lines, ultimately benefiting Dutch rule.[^68] From this perspective, Salim's religious conservatism and anti-communism made him an obstacle to more radical forms of anti-colonial resistance.

Some scholars have questioned the practical impact of Salim's diplomatic achievements. While securing recognition from Arab states was symbolically important, these countries had little power to influence Dutch policy or military actions. The Round Table Conference that Salim helped negotiate contained significant compromises—including Indonesian assumption of Dutch colonial debts and the postponement of the West Papua question—that subsequent generations viewed as betrayals of complete independence.[^69] Critics argue that Salim's diplomatic approach led to a negotiated settlement that preserved significant Dutch economic interests and created long-term problems for Indonesia.

Scholars examining the role of Islamic politics in Indonesian independence have noted that Salim's shift of Sarekat Islam away from political confrontation toward cultural and religious activities after 1923 effectively sidelined the organization from the revolutionary struggle.[^70] While this may have reflected his personal preference for gradualism and intellectual persuasion over revolutionary action, it meant that Sarekat Islam played a diminishing role in the actual independence movement compared to secular nationalist organizations like Soekarno's PNI.

Feminist scholars have offered mixed assessments of Salim's views on gender. While his statements supporting women's education and his claim that Islam pioneered women's emancipation were progressive for his era, his actual policies and the roles women played in his political activities remained limited.[^71] The gap between his rhetoric about women's rights and the patriarchal structures he operated within raises questions about the depth of his commitment to gender equality.

Contemporary scholars studying corruption and governance in Indonesia sometimes cite Salim's personal integrity as implicitly critical of current political culture. However, some argue that his extreme frugality and rejection of personal enrichment, while morally admirable, also meant he failed to build lasting political institutions or a political machine that could have extended his reformist influence.[^72] His legacy remained more individual than institutional, limiting its long-term impact on Indonesian political culture.

Historians examining Indonesia's regional diversity have noted that Salim, despite his Minangkabau origins, operated primarily within Java-centric nationalist politics and did little to address the marginalization of outer island regions in the independence movement and subsequent Indonesian state.[^73] This limitation reflects broader patterns in Indonesian nationalism but nonetheless represents a blind spot in Salim's political vision.
