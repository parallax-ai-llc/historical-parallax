## Summary

Andrea Ghez is an American astronomer who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the center of the Milky Way galaxy. She is only the fourth woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics. Using the W. M. Keck Observatory, she tracked the orbits of stars near the galactic center, providing compelling evidence for a supermassive black hole. Her work has been fundamental to understanding the role of black holes in galaxy evolution.
