## Summary

Gilbert N. Lewis was an American physical chemist who is known for his discovery of the covalent bond and his concept of electron pairs (Lewis structures). He also developed the concept of Lewis acids and bases, which extended acid-base theory beyond aqueous solutions. Despite being nominated 41 times, he never received a Nobel Prize, making him one of the most notable omissions in Nobel history.
