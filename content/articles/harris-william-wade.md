## Summary

William Wade Harris was a Liberian-born prophet who conducted one of the most successful evangelistic campaigns in African history. Between 1913 and 1915, he walked through Ivory Coast and Gold Coast (Ghana), converting over 100,000 people to Christianity. He combined Christian preaching with African spiritual sensibility, using a cross-staff, gourd rattle, and Bible. He was eventually expelled by French colonial authorities but his converts formed the basis of Christianity in Ivory Coast.
