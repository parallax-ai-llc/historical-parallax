## Summary

Khorloogiin Choibalsan (8 February 1895 – 26 January 1952) was a Mongolian revolutionary and communist leader who ruled the Mongolian People's Republic from 1939 until his death in 1952.[^1] Often referred to as "the Stalin of Mongolia," he was one of the founding members of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and played a pivotal role in establishing Mongolia's communist state.[^2] As Marshal of the Mongolian Armed Forces and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Choibalsan oversaw Mongolia's modernization while simultaneously conducting brutal Stalinist purges that killed an estimated 30,000 to 35,000 people between 1937 and 1939.[^3] His legacy remains deeply controversial in modern Mongolia, viewed by some as a defender of national sovereignty and architect of modernization, and by others as a ruthless dictator responsible for mass executions and the near-complete destruction of Mongolian Buddhism.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Khorloogiin Choibalsan was born on 8 February 1895 in Achit Beysiyn, near present-day Choibalsan city in Dornod Province.[^5] He was the youngest of four children born to an unmarried herdswoman named Khorloo, from whom his patronymic "Khorloogiin" derives.[^6] His father was likely a Barga tribesman named Jamsu, a Daur Mongol from Inner Mongolia, though Choibalsan later claimed to be unaware of his father's identity.[^7] Born into extreme poverty and never knowing his father, young Choibalsan spent his early years in destitution with his mother.[^8]

Named Dugar at birth, he assumed the religious name Choibalsan at age 13 after entering the local Buddhist monastery of San Beysiyn Khüree, where he trained to become a Lamaist monk.[^9] This religious education was typical for poor Mongolian boys at the time, offering one of the few paths to literacy and social advancement. Five years later, at age 18, he and another novice fled the monastery and traveled to Khüree (also known as Urga, present-day Ulaanbaatar), where Choibalsan worked various odd jobs to survive.[^10]

To prevent the young runaway from being forcibly returned to the monastery, a sympathetic Buryat teacher named Nikolai Danchinov enrolled him in the Russian consulate's Russian-Mongolian Translators' School.[^11] This proved to be a turning point in Choibalsan's life, as it provided him with education in Russian language and exposed him to modern ideas. Between 1914 and 1917, he continued his education at a gymnasium in Irkutsk, Russia.[^12] During this period, living among Irkutsk's radicalized student population, Choibalsan was exposed to Bolshevik revolutionary ideology that would shape his entire political career.[^13] In 1917, when communist separatists called for young expatriates to return to fight in the upcoming rebellion against Chinese occupation, Choibalsan answered the call, launching his revolutionary career.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Choibalsan's path to power began with his involvement in Mongolia's independence movement. Exposed to Bolshevism while in Irkutsk, he joined the revolutionary Consular Hill or Konsulyn Denj group, which was heavily influenced by Bolshevist philosophy and established to resist the Chinese occupation of Outer Mongolia after 1919.[^15] In late June 1920, Choibalsan and fellow revolutionary Danzan embarked for Irkutsk along with others known as "the infamous First Seven" to establish contacts with the Soviets and seek assistance in their struggle for independence.[^16]

On June 25, 1920, two revolutionary groups met and formed the Mongolian People's Party, adopted a "Party Oath," and agreed to send Danzan and Choibalsan as delegates to Russia.[^17] At a Soviet-organized MPP conference held secretly in Troitskosavsk from March 1-3, 1921—subsequently regarded as the first congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party—Choibalsan was elected a member of the provisional revolutionary government.[^18] He was also appointed Political Commissar (Deputy Chief and chief propagandist) of the Mongolian People's Army, commanded by the legendary revolutionary hero Damdin Sükhbaatar.[^19]

The Mongolian Revolution of 1921, with Soviet Red Army assistance, successfully expelled Russian White Guards from the country and established the foundation for what would become the Mongolian People's Republic in 1924.[^20] Throughout the 1920s, Choibalsan held several important political and military roles, steadily consolidating his position within the party hierarchy.[^21] He served as chairman of the Presidium of the State Little Khural (head of state) from 1929 to 1930.[^22]

Choibalsan's ultimate rise to supreme power came in the late 1930s during the Great Purge. In 1936, he was made Marshal of the Mongolian Armed Forces alongside Gelegdorjiin Demid.[^23] By 1937, he had become commander-in-chief of the Mongolian People's Army and head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.[^24] The day after Marshal Demid's burial on September 3, 1937, Choibalsan, as interior minister, issued Order 366, which declared that many in Mongolia "had fallen under the influence of Japanese spies and provocateurs."[^25] That same month, Stalin ordered the stationing of 30,000 Red Army troops in Mongolia.[^26] By 1939, Choibalsan had assumed complete power as Chairman of the Council of Ministers (premier), a position he would hold until his death, with control over all branches of government and the military.[^27]

## Major Achievements

### Military Victory at Khalkhin Gol

Choibalsan's most celebrated achievement was Mongolia's role in the decisive Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939. The battle, fought from May to September 1939, was an undeclared war between Soviet-Mongolian forces and the Japanese Kwantung Army over a disputed border region.[^28] The conflict embroiled over 100,000 troops and 1,000 tanks and aircraft.[^29] In the climactic engagement from August 20-31, 1939, Soviet General Georgy Zhukov, working closely with Choibalsan, launched a devastating attack that encircled and crushed the Japanese Sixth Army.[^30]

The victory came at significant cost, with 9,703 Soviet soldiers and 165 Mongolian soldiers killed, while Japanese casualties ranged from 30,000 to 50,000 men killed and wounded.[^31] The battle had profound consequences for World War II, as it convinced Japan to abandon plans for a northern strategy against the Soviet Union and instead pursue the "southern option" of attacking British and American territories in the Pacific.[^32] The victory painted Choibalsan as a capable military leader and, according to state propaganda, proved that the development path chosen by the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party was correct.[^33] The victory helped cement Choibalsan's growing cult of personality, which portrayed him as a staunch defender of Mongolian independence against imperialist Japanese aggression.[^34]

### Modernization and Industrialization

Under Choibalsan's government, Mongolia underwent significant modernization and industrialization. The Nalaikh Coal Mine, the electric grid, the Züün Bayan petroleum factory, other metal and mineral factories, the Naushk-Ulaanbaatar railway, and modern transportation and communications systems were all developed during his rule.[^35] The Choibalsan-led MPRP introduced modern medicine, brought about almost universal literacy, and cultivated widespread industrialization that led to greatly improved standards of living for many Mongolians.[^36]

In addition to establishing the country's first major university, Choibalsan initiated policies to increase the literacy rate and developed the ten-year elementary, middle, and high school system.[^37] Funded largely through Soviet aid, the country's first five-year plan (1948-1952) focused on economic development, infrastructure construction, and doubling the country's livestock—though this last goal was not achieved.[^38] These modernization efforts fundamentally transformed Mongolia from a largely feudal, theocratic society into an industrialized socialist state aligned with the Soviet model.[^39]

### International Recognition

In July 1944, Stalin awarded Choibalsan the Order of Lenin for his, and Mongolia's, contributions to the Soviet war effort against Germany.[^40] Choibalsan also received the title of Hero of the Mongolian People's Republic, the highest distinction in the MPR, and in 1945, a special Gold Star insignia was introduced for this honor.[^41] His elevation to Marshal in 1936 placed him among Mongolia's highest-ranking military officers, with only two Marshal stars ever awarded—to Choibalsan and later to his successor Tsedenbal.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Great Purge (1937-1939)

The darkest chapter of Choibalsan's rule was his orchestration of Stalinist purges in Mongolia between 1937 and 1939. As head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Choibalsan led what is known in Mongolia as the Great Repression, an 18-month period of heightened political violence and persecution.[^43] Soviet NKVD advisors, under the nominal direction of Choibalsan, persecuted thousands of individuals and organizations perceived as threats to the Mongolian revolution and growing Soviet influence.[^44]

Estimates vary, but anywhere between 20,000 and 35,000 "enemies of the revolution" were executed, a figure representing three to five percent of Mongolia's total population at the time.[^45] The victims were mostly Buddhist clergy, intelligentsia, political dissidents, ethnic Buryats and Kazakhs, and other perceived enemies of the state.[^46] As chair of the Extraordinary Committee, Choibalsan personally signed execution orders for 22,000 people.[^47] Almost a tenth of Mongolia's population—approximately 100,000 people out of a population slightly over one million—died or was imprisoned due to the machinations of Stalin and Choibalsan.[^48]

### Destruction of Buddhism

Choibalsan's persecution of Buddhism was particularly devastating. An ex-monk himself, he reportedly "hated religion with a vengeance."[^49] In 1929 and 1930, Choibalsan supported implementation of Soviet-backed leftist policies including rapid collectivization, land expropriation, and systematic persecution of the Buddhist faith.[^50] In a spasm of violence lasting nearly 18 months, Choibalsan's troika approved and carried out the execution of over 17,000 lamas accused of counterrevolutionary activities.[^51] Monks who were not executed were either conscripted into the Mongolian armed forces or forcibly laicized, while 746 of the country's monasteries were liquidated.[^52]

Almost all of Mongolia's over 700 Buddhist monasteries were looted or destroyed.[^53] His intense persecution of Buddhism brought about the institution's near-complete extinction in the country.[^54] Mongolia's Buddhist clergy, which had numbered over 100,000 monks before the purges, was reduced to only 200-300 monks by the year 2000, though a majority of the population continued to identify as Buddhist.[^55] According to scholar Christopher Kaplonski, the strength of Buddhism in Mongolia was such that, if Communism had not destroyed religion, religion would have destroyed Communism.[^56]

### Subordination to Soviet Interests

Choibalsan's rule was characterized by near-total subordination to Soviet directives. Mongolia's economic, political, and military ties to the Soviet Union deepened under his leadership, and Choibalsan consistently sought Moscow's assent before making key policy decisions, even in minor matters, making efforts to curry Moscow's favor whenever possible.[^57] The Mongolian People's Republic functioned as a satellite state of the Soviet Union for its entire history.[^58]

This dependency became particularly evident in Choibalsan's failed attempt to realize his dream of a "Greater Mongolia." After Japan's defeat in 1945, Choibalsan saw an opportunity to unite Outer and Inner Mongolia. He unleashed a brief wave of pan-Mongolist nationalism through the press and ordered Mongolian troops to move south of the Great Wall as far as Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Batu-Khaalga.[^59] However, an angry Stalin ordered him to call the troops back.[^60] Stalin had already sacrificed Choibalsan's vision of a united Mongolia at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 in return for Soviet gains.[^61] As late as August 1949, Choibalsan still harbored hopes for eventual unification, but when it became clear that Stalin would never back unification, he grew increasingly disillusioned with his former hero.[^62]

---

## Personal Life

Information about Choibalsan's personal and family life is relatively limited compared to his public career. He married a modern woman named B. Gündegmaa, though sources indicate he had been married at least twice.[^63] Choibalsan had no biological children with either of his wives.[^64] In 1937, he adopted the son of one of his Interior Ministry subordinates, though there were rumors about the boy's true parentage.[^65] Later, his wife Gündegmaa adopted a girl named Suwd.[^66]

Growing up in extreme poverty and never knowing his father, Choibalsan's early experiences of deprivation likely shaped his personality and worldview.[^67] His transformation from a Buddhist monk trainee to one of Mongolia's most ruthless anti-religious persecutors suggests a complex psychological journey. Contemporary accounts describe him as devoted to Stalin and Soviet ideology, though his later disillusionment over the Greater Mongolia issue hints at genuine nationalist sentiment beneath his communist orthodoxy.[^68]

Choibalsan's rule was maintained by a repressive state apparatus and an elaborate cult of personality.[^69] Like his mentor Stalin, he became a ruthless cult-leader who demanded absolute loyalty and eliminated perceived rivals without hesitation.[^70] His intense focus on consolidating power and implementing Soviet directives appears to have left little room for a conventional family life, with most of his energy devoted to political and military affairs.

## Legacy

### Death and Initial Commemoration

In late 1951, Choibalsan traveled to Moscow to receive treatment for kidney cancer, reportedly at Soviet insistence due to the lack of equipment in Mongolia to treat the illness.[^71] He died there on January 26, 1952.[^72] Upon hearing of Choibalsan's death, the aging Stalin commented, "They die one after another. Shcherbakov, Zhdanov, Dimitrov, Choibalsan ... die so quickly! We must change the old doctors for new ones."[^73] Popular belief in Mongolia that their leader had been poisoned by Kremlin doctors later gave way to speculation that Stalin himself, irritated by Choibalsan's obstinate nationalism and advocacy for Mongolia's independence, had ordered his death.[^74]

Choibalsan's body was returned to Mongolia with full military honors, and he was initially buried at the Altan Ulgii cemetery in Ulaanbaatar.[^75] Later, a grand mausoleum was constructed for him. However, in August 2005, the mausoleum was dismantled, and Choibalsan was quietly reburied in the Altan-Ulgii Cemetery on the outskirts of the capital city.[^76]

### Continued Presence in Modern Mongolia

Unlike Stalin's statue, which was removed from Mongolia in 1990 after the fall of communism, Choibalsan's statue still stands in front of the National University in Ulaanbaatar.[^77] The capital of Dornod aimag continues to carry his name, as does the city of Choibalsan, where a museum dedicated to General G.K. Zhukov and the 1939 Battle of Khalkhin Gol preserves the memory of that victory.[^78] Since the end of socialist rule in 1990, re-examination of Choibalsan's rule has occurred, though he is not the object of strong resentment in Mongolia compared to the fate of similar figures in other post-communist nations.[^79]

### The Paradox of Choibalsan's Legacy

The most striking aspect of Choibalsan's legacy is the paradox of how he is still celebrated to some extent in contemporary Mongolia despite his undisputed responsibility for heinous crimes against fellow Mongolians.[^80] Several factors explain this phenomenon. Remnants of his strong personality cult, as well as successful efforts by his successor Tsedenbal to obstruct "de-Stalinization" efforts that could have shed light on Choibalsan's actions during the purges, helped solidify the positive regard many Mongolians held of their former leader.[^81]

Many Mongolians view Choibalsan's role in both the 1921 Revolution and helping ensure Mongolian independence as sufficient to overlook his crimes.[^82] A common narrative suggests that Choibalsan had no choice but to oversee the execution of tens of thousands of people, despite the counterexamples of leaders like Genden and Amar, who resisted the Stalinist-era purges, which ultimately led to their deaths.[^83] Public anger over the violence of the purges falls predominantly on the Soviet Union and the NKVD, with Choibalsan viewed sympathetically—if not pathetically—as a puppet with little choice but to follow Moscow's instructions.[^84]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Choibalsan emphasize his role as a founding revolutionary who helped liberate Mongolia from Chinese occupation and establish national independence. The victory at Khalkhin Gol is celebrated as a triumph that protected Mongolian sovereignty against Japanese imperialism and demonstrated Mongolia's military capability.[^85] Supporters point to the genuine modernization achievements under his rule: the introduction of universal education, modern healthcare, industrialization, and infrastructure development that transformed Mongolia from a feudal theocracy into a modern state.[^86]

Some historians note that Choibalsan operated within severe constraints imposed by Soviet domination, and that resistance to Stalin's directives would have resulted in his own execution, as happened to his predecessors.[^87] From this perspective, Choibalsan's compliance with Soviet purges is seen as tragic pragmatism rather than personal sadism. The controversy, as some scholars frame it, centers on how effectively each leader pursued and secured the interests of Mongolia in its relationship with the Soviet Union, with Choibalsan credited for maintaining some degree of Mongolian autonomy despite overwhelming Soviet pressure.[^88]

The enduring presence of monuments and place names honoring Choibalsan reflects a segment of Mongolian society that views him primarily through the lens of national liberation and modernization, choosing to emphasize these achievements over the atrocities of the purge period.[^89] This perspective holds that without Choibalsan's leadership during World War II and its aftermath, Mongolia might have been absorbed by either Japan, China, or the Soviet Union itself.

### Negative Views

Critics of Choibalsan condemn him as one of history's most brutal dictators, responsible for killing a staggering percentage of his own population. The scholarly work "Poisoned Arrows: The Stalin-Choibalsan Mongolian Massacres, 1921-1941" by Shagdariin Sandag and Harry H. Kendall, based on previously closed archives of the Mongolian government, documents in detail the systematic nature of the purges and Choibalsan's central role in organizing them.[^90] As chair of the Extraordinary Committee, he personally signed thousands of execution orders, demonstrating direct personal culpability rather than mere complicity.[^91]

The near-total destruction of Mongolian Buddhism—one of the world's most significant Buddhist cultures—stands as an act of cultural genocide. The execution of over 17,000 lamas and the destruction of over 700 monasteries represent an irreversible loss of cultural heritage, religious tradition, and historical continuity.[^92] Critics argue that Choibalsan's background as a former monk makes his persecution of Buddhism particularly hypocritical and suggests personal psychological pathology rather than mere ideological commitment.[^93]

Historians critical of Choibalsan reject the "puppet" narrative, noting that while Soviet pressure was real, Choibalsan demonstrated considerable autonomy in other areas and showed genuine zeal in implementing the purges that exceeded even Soviet expectations.[^94] His cult of personality, modeled on Stalin's, reveals a leader who actively embraced totalitarian methods and personally benefited from the climate of terror he created.[^95] The fact that Mongolia continues to honor Choibalsan with statues and place names is viewed by critics as a failure to adequately reckon with the crimes of the communist period, comparable to Eastern European nations that have more thoroughly repudiated their Stalinist past.[^96]
