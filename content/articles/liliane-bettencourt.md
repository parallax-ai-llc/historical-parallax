## Summary

Liliane Bettencourt was the principal shareholder of L'Oréal and the richest woman in the world for over two decades. She inherited her stake from her father, Eugène Schueller, who founded L'Oréal in 1909. Under her family's stewardship, L'Oréal grew into the world's largest cosmetics company. Her later years were marked by a legal battle with her daughter over her mental competency and allegations of political campaign finance violations.
