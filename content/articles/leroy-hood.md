## Summary

Leroy Hood co-invented the automated DNA sequencer, the protein sequencer, the DNA synthesizer, and the protein synthesizer — four instruments that made the Human Genome Project and modern genomics possible. His development of these tools transformed biology from a largely descriptive science to a quantitative, high-throughput one.
