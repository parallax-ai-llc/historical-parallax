## Summary

Field Marshal Alan Francis Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke (1883-1963), served as Chief of the Imperial General Staff during World War II and was Winston Churchill's principal military advisor. Born into an Anglo-Irish military family, he pioneered artillery innovations in World War I and orchestrated Britain's wartime strategy from 1941 to 1946. More than any other British military leader, Brooke shaped Allied strategy that brought victory to the Western Allies, though he remains relatively unsung compared to contemporaries like Montgomery and Churchill. His candid war diaries revealed his stormy relationship with Churchill and controversial criticisms of American military leadership.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Alan Francis Brooke was born on 23 July 1883 at Bagnères-de-Bigorre in the French Pyrenees to a prominent Anglo-Irish family from West Ulster.[^3] He was the seventh and youngest child of Sir Victor Brooke, 3rd Baronet, of Colebrooke Park, Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, and Alice Bellingham, second daughter of Sir Alan Bellingham, 3rd Baronet, of Castle Bellingham in County Louth.[^4] Both parents belonged to the Protestant Ascendancy class in Ireland. The Brookes had earned renown as the "Fighting Brookes of Colebrooke," with a distinguished military lineage spanning the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and World War I.[^5]

Tragedy struck young Alan when his father died when he was just eight years old, a loss that profoundly affected his upbringing.[^6] Unlike most British officers of his generation, Brooke received an unconventional Continental education. He attended a day school in Pau, France, where he lived until age sixteen, becoming bilingual in French—which he spoke with a heavy Gascon accent as his first language due to his upbringing in the French Pyrenees—and English.[^7] He also became fluent in German and later learned Urdu and Persian, linguistic abilities that would prove valuable throughout his military career.[^8]

Despite his impressive language skills, Brooke's academic performance in military entrance examinations was initially underwhelming. He "only just" qualified for the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, ranking sixty-fifth out of seventy-two candidates in the entrance exam.[^9] However, he demonstrated his true capabilities during his training, passing out at seventeenth position, a significant improvement that foreshadowed his future military excellence.[^10]

## Rise to Power

Brooke's military career began with the Royal Artillery, where he would establish his reputation as an innovative tactician. During World War I, he served with distinction on the Western Front, commanding Canadian and Indian artillery units.[^11] His breakthrough came during the Battle of the Somme in mid-1916, when, as a major serving as brigade major for the artillery of the 18th (Eastern) Division under Major-General Ivor Maxse, he coordinated artillery support and introduced the French-inspired creeping barrage technique on 1 July 1916 during the division's assault on Montauban village.[^12]

The creeping barrage revolutionized infantry support tactics. Brooke was credited with producing the first systematic implementation of this technique, which ensured ground between enemy trench lines was covered and minimized exposure of advancing infantry to unsilenced machine-gun fire.[^13] Though he attributed the idea to the French, its execution proved highly successful, shielding advancing troops by maintaining a moving curtain of fire ahead of them. For this innovation and leadership, Brooke was awarded the Distinguished Service Order.[^14] An expert on artillery tactics, he was mentioned six times in dispatches and became chief artillery officer in the 1st British Army, achieving the rank of lieutenant colonel by war's end.[^15]

In 1917, Brooke served as Royal Artillery staff officer with the Canadian Corps, where he demonstrated his mastery of complex operations. The 33-year-old Major Brooke was the mastermind behind the rolling barrage at Vimy Ridge, coordinating communication and transport plans to work with the intricate barrage plans.[^16] His overall artillery plan proved crucial to the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge during the assault of 9-12 April 1917, establishing his reputation as one of Britain's finest gunners.[^17]

During the interwar period, Brooke continued his professional development, attending the first post-war course at the Staff College, Camberley in 1919, where he impressed both fellow students and instructors.[^18] In the 1930s, he commanded an infantry brigade and later Great Britain's only mobile division, the forerunner of the armored divisions that would prove decisive in World War II.[^19] This progression through increasingly responsible positions positioned Brooke perfectly for the challenges that lay ahead.

## Major Achievements

When World War II erupted, Brooke began service as commander of the II Corps in France. During the catastrophic German offensive of May 1940, he played a crucial role in the Dunkirk evacuation. Lieutenant-General Brooke commanded Britain's II Corps during the retreat, tasked with conducting a holding action with the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 50th Divisions along the Ypres-Comines canal while the rest of the British Expeditionary Force fell back.[^20] He rushed four divisions forward to plug a 26-kilometer gap that developed with Belgian capitulation, with desperate fighting at Wytschaete and Poperinge.[^21] Despite writing pessimistically in his diary on 23 May that "Nothing but a miracle can save the BEF now," his brilliant leadership of British ground troops contributed greatly to Operation Dynamo's success.[^22]

After the Dunkirk evacuation on 30 May, Brooke returned to England and was tasked with assembling another British Expeditionary Force to be sent to France.[^23] However, the rapid deterioration of the French military situation led to a pivotal moment in Brooke's career. On the evening of 14 June 1940, in a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Brooke persuaded the Prime Minister that all British troops in France should be disengaged and evacuated.[^24] Historian Max Hastings asserts that "in that conversation, Brooke saved almost 200,000 men from death or captivity."[^25] This decision led to Operation Aerial, the evacuation from western French ports (15-25 June 1940), which rescued an additional 191,870 troops.[^26]

In July 1940, Brooke was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, with orders to take charge of anti-invasion preparations.[^27] Contrary to his predecessor General Sir Edmund Ironside, who favored static coastal defence, Brooke developed a mobile reserve designed to swiftly counterattack enemy forces before they were established, with a light line of defence on the coast to delay landings as much as possible.[^28] He even planned unconventional measures, acknowledging after the war that he "had every intention of using sprayed mustard gas on the beaches" if Germany invaded.[^29] Despite never achieving the force numbers he deemed necessary, Brooke maintained that Britain's defensive situation was far from "helpless," expressing confidence that "given a fair share of the fortunes of war we should certainly succeed in finally defending these shores."[^30]

The pinnacle of Brooke's career came in December 1941 when he succeeded Field Marshal Sir John Dill as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army.[^31] In March 1942, he also became chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, making him the foremost military advisor to Prime Minister Winston Churchill and coordinator of British military efforts in the Allies' victory.[^32] As CIGS, Brooke represented the British Army on the Chiefs of Staff Committee and exercised strong influence on Allied grand strategy until 1945.[^33]

Brooke's strategic vision focused primarily on the Mediterranean theatre, with principal aims to rid North Africa of Axis forces and knock Italy out of the war, thereby opening the Mediterranean for Allied shipping.[^34] At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, where he served as Churchill's primary military adviser, Brooke successfully argued for prioritizing Mediterranean operations, leading to the decision to invade Sicily under General Eisenhower's command—a choice that effectively postponed the planned invasion of Western Europe until 1944.[^35] The North African campaign concluded successfully in May 1943, followed by Allied capture of Sicily in August and invasion of Italy in September.[^36]

Among Brooke's most crucial contributions was his opposition to an early landing in France, which proved instrumental in delaying Operation Overlord until June 1944.[^37] Though Brooke voiced doubts about a Normandy invasion and did not believe the Wehrmacht would be sufficiently weakened before 1944, his caution likely prevented a premature assault that could have ended in disaster.[^38] He promoted Field Marshal on 1 January 1944, Brooke continued to guide British strategy through the war's final campaigns.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Brooke's wartime service generated significant controversies, particularly regarding his assessments of American military leadership and strategy. His famous war diaries, kept throughout the Second World War and originally intended for his wife Benita, contained pungent, even brutal criticisms that provoked scandal when published in the late 1950s.[^40]

Brooke described American generals Eisenhower and Marshall as "poor strategists."[^41] His assessment of Eisenhower proved especially harsh: "I am afraid that Eisenhower as a general is hopeless! He submerges himself in politics (as during the 1942 North African invasion) and neglects his military duties, partly, I am afraid, because he knows little if anything about military matters."[^42] Though he acknowledged that "as supreme commander, what he may have lacked in military ability he greatly made up for by the charm of his personality," this criticism has been characterized by some historians as "self-serving nonsense."[^43] Eisenhower himself learned from early mistakes and evolved into arguably the most effective allied coalition commander in history during 1944-45.[^44]

Brooke's relationship with the American Joint Chiefs of Staff proved contentious. His Mediterranean strategy contrasted sharply with the American commitment to an early invasion of western Europe, leading to heated arguments at conferences of the Combined Chiefs of Staff.[^45] At the Quebec Conference, Brooke noted in his diary that "we had a most painful meeting and we settled nothing. I entirely failed to get Marshall to realise the relation between cross-Channel and Italian operations and the repercussions which the one exercises on the other. It is quite impossible to argue with him as he does not begin to understand a strategic problem."[^46]

General Alan Brooke was strongly opposed to the Combined Chiefs of Staff concept, fearing that if Western Allies were placed under international unified commands, the United States would become dominant, and that situating the CCS in Washington would leave Britain unable to initiate military policy.[^47] At the Casablanca Conference, when Marshall and King proposed increasing Allied resources in the Pacific from 15 to 30 percent, Brooke questioned whether further resources were required since the Japanese appeared to be on the defensive.[^48] Marshall went so far as to claim "the whole concept of defeating Germany first had been jeopardized by the lack of resources in the Pacific," a statement that was "anathema to the British" and "a quite deliberate provocation."[^49]

Brooke was disliked by most Americans, and the sentiment was mutual, though professional cooperation generally prevailed over personal animosity.[^50] The publication of his diaries, first in abridged form edited by historian Sir Arthur Bryant in 1957 (The Turn of the Tide) and 1959 (Triumph in the West), and later in unexpurgated form in 2001 edited by Alex Danchev and Daniel Todman, revealed criticisms that had been suppressed in earlier versions.[^51]

Brooke's relationship with Winston Churchill proved equally complex and stormy. He was often frustrated with the Prime Minister's habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters.[^52] In typical diary passages, Churchill is described as "a genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision – he is quite the most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck but I should not have missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!"[^53] A particularly revealing entry from 10 September 1944 captures this ambivalence: "Never have I admired and despised a man simultaneously to the same extent."[^54]

Brooke complained about Churchill's strategic interventions, writing: "We had a long and painful evening of it listening to Winston's strategic ravings" and describing Churchill as "a complete amateur of strategy" who "swamps himself in details he should never look at."[^55] He lamented that "Unfortunately he always wished to stick his fingers into a pie before it was cooked!" and noted "I was fortunate if I did not see Winston for 6 hours."[^56]

One reason Brooke changed his mind about publishing the diaries was the lack of credit given to him and the Chiefs of Staff in Churchill's own war memoirs, which essentially presented their ideas and innovations as the Prime Minister's own.[^57] This sense of having his contributions overlooked motivated Brooke to ensure the historical record reflected his actual role in wartime decision-making.

## Personal Life

Alan Brooke's personal life was marked by both tragedy and eventual contentment through two marriages. He married Jane Mary Richardson, daughter of Colonel John Richardson of Rossfad, County Fermanagh, on 28 July 1914, following a six-year engagement.[^58] The couple had two children: a daughter, Rosemary Brooke, born on 25 October 1918, and a son, Thomas Brooke, later 2nd Viscount Alanbrooke, born on 9 January 1920.[^59]

Tragedy struck on 4 September 1925 when Jane Brooke died from complications following a car accident near Ferghana, in which Brooke was driving.[^60] He attributed responsibility to himself for the crash, a burden of guilt he carried for years. This devastating loss profoundly affected Brooke's emotional state during the late 1920s.

Brooke found happiness again when he remarried on 7 December 1929 to Benita Blanche Pelly, daughter of Sir Harold Pelly, 4th Baronet, and widow of Sir Thomas Evans Keith Lees, 2nd Baronet.[^61] This second marriage brought a calming influence to his high-strung temperament and proved a source of strength, especially during the immense pressures of World War II.[^62] Their marriage produced two children: a daughter, Kathleen Benita Brooke, born on 23 January 1931, and a son, Alan Victor Harold Brooke, later 3rd Viscount Alanbrooke, born in 1932.[^63]

Beyond his military duties, Brooke was a noted ornithologist with particular expertise in bird photography.[^64] He was considered one of the world's pioneers in wildlife photography and was an avid bird-watcher, pursuits that provided respite from the stresses of high command.[^65] His love of nature extended to hunting and fishing among his great interests.[^66] As an amateur ornithologist, he maintained a friendship with Peter Scott, who founded the World Wildlife Fund.[^67] His collection includes doodles of animals, plants, landscapes and shooting expeditions that occupied the margins of his letters, paying testament to his accomplishments as an artist and his love of the natural world.[^68]

Brooke served as president of the Zoological Society of London between 1950 and 1954, and vice-president of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) between 1949 and 1961.[^69] These positions reflected his genuine passion for ornithology and conservation, pursuits that distinguished him from many of his military contemporaries. His ability to balance the brutal demands of wartime leadership with gentle appreciation for nature's beauty revealed a complex, multifaceted personality.

## Legacy

Field Marshal Alan Brooke's legacy endures as a testament to effective leadership and the importance of adaptability in military strategy, solidifying his position as an iconic figure in the annals of military history.[^70] More than any other English military leader, he helped to shape the strategy that brought victory to the Western Allies in the war.[^71] As CIGS, Brooke exerted strong influence on the grand strategy of the Western Allies, with the war in the west unfolding more or less according to his plans, at least until 1943.[^72]

For his military services, Brooke received numerous honors. He was created Baron Alanbrooke of Brookeborough in the County of Fermanagh in 1945, and Viscount Alanbrooke of Brookeborough in 1946.[^73] In 1946, he was created a Knight of the Garter and admitted to the Order of Merit.[^74] His military decorations included Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (1942), Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (1953), and his World War I Distinguished Service Order with Bar.[^75] He also received foreign decorations including the Order of Polonia Restituta 1st Class (Poland, 1943), Order of Suvorov 1st Class (USSR, 1944), Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold with Palm (Belgium, 1946), and Military Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia, 1946).[^76]

As the most distinguished member of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, Alanbrooke became Master Gunner of St. James's Park in 1946.[^77] After retiring from the British Army, he served as Lord High Constable of England during the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.[^78]

In 1993, a statue of Field Marshal Lord Alanbrooke sculpted by Ivor Roberts-Jones was erected in front of the Ministry of Defence in Whitehall, London, unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 25 May 1993.[^79] The statue is flanked by statues of Britain's other two leading generals of the Second World War, William Slim and Bernard Montgomery, symbolizing his equal stature among Britain's wartime military leadership.[^80]

On 17 June 1963, Alanbrooke suffered a heart attack and died quietly in his bed with his wife beside him.[^81] Ironically, the same day he had been due to attend the Garter Service in St George's Chapel, Windsor. His funeral was held at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, on 26 June 1963, and he was subsequently buried in St Mary's churchyard near his home in Hartley Wintney.[^82] A memorial to Brooke was dedicated at the Royal Memorial Chapel, Sandhurst, on 21 November 1965.[^83]

Despite his wartime achievements, Alan Brooke remains a relatively unsung hero, especially when compared to contemporary figures like Churchill and Montgomery.[^84] Yet historians who assess this remarkable Ulsterman's war record emphasize that one must give attention to prudence, and it should be humbling to consider the judgment, intellectual talent, and military skill with which Brooke approached so many difficult decisions.[^85]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Military historians have recognized Brooke's crucial contributions to Allied victory. Historians describe Alan Francis Brooke as resolute, logical, articulate, and probably the best British strategist since the Duke of Marlborough.[^86] Churchill found in Alanbrooke the completely professional soldier, and Churchill's chief staff officer concluded that Brooke was the best of all the eight Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff he had observed.[^87]

According to historian Max Hastings, the partnership between Churchill and Brooke "created the most efficient machine for the higher direction of the war possessed by any combatant nation, even if its judgments were sometimes flawed and its ability to enforce its wishes increasingly constrained."[^88] This assessment highlights how their complementary strengths—Churchill's political vision and inspirational leadership combined with Brooke's strategic acumen and military professionalism—produced results greater than either could have achieved alone.

Brooke became the chief spokesman for British strategic priorities during World War II, and as chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, he represented the members' views ably and firmly to the Prime Minister and to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, thereby exercising strong influence on Allied strategy.[^89] His Mediterranean strategy, while controversial among American commanders, successfully eliminated Axis forces from North Africa and knocked Italy out of the war, opening vital sea lanes and drawing German forces away from other theaters.[^90]

Professional soldiers particularly admired Brooke's technical competence. His innovations in artillery tactics during World War I, from the creeping barrage at the Somme to the complex fire plans at Vimy Ridge, demonstrated mastery of the military art.[^91] His ability to coordinate complex operations involving multiple divisions and different national contingents proved invaluable during both world wars.

Brooke's relationship with Bernard Montgomery exemplified his talent for identifying and nurturing military excellence. Montgomery commanded a division in Brooke's II Corps during the 1939-40 campaign in France, and it is clear from Brooke's diary that Montgomery reached the heights he did because Brooke believed in his ability and promoted him accordingly.[^92] Brooke persuaded Churchill to select Montgomery as the replacement when William Gott was killed in 1942, arguing that Montgomery was a much superior general to Alexander and ensuring his appointment to command the 21st Army Group for D-Day.[^93] Even when Montgomery proved difficult—noting that "Monty is doing what he does best - training troops and making enemies"—Brooke exercised unwavering loyalty and patience, playing the role of chaperone to the egotistical and socially inept Montgomery while never hesitating to tell him when his behavior was out of bounds.[^94]

### Negative Views

Critics of Brooke question whether his strategic caution and preference for peripheral operations delayed victory and increased Allied casualties. His opposition to early cross-Channel operations, while prudent given British resource constraints and the need to rebuild military capacity after Dunkirk, may have prolonged the war by allowing Germany additional time to fortify the Atlantic Wall and transfer divisions from the Eastern Front.

American military leaders, particularly General George Marshall, viewed Brooke's Mediterranean strategy with considerable skepticism. At the Quebec Conference, Marshall's frustration with Brooke was mutual, with the American general believing Brooke failed to understand the importance of concentrating Allied strength for a decisive blow against Germany in Western Europe rather than dispersing forces in secondary theaters.[^95] The American preference for direct confrontation through Operation Overlord contrasted sharply with British indirect approaches influenced by painful World War I memories and current resource limitations.

Brooke's dismissive assessments of American military competence damaged Anglo-American military relations. His characterization of Eisenhower as knowing "little if anything about military matters" overlooked Eisenhower's genuine strengths in coalition management and his growth as a commander.[^96] Such judgments reflected a certain arrogance that alienated American colleagues who found Brooke difficult and condescending.

Some historians argue that Brooke's influence on Churchill was not always positive. While he provided professional military advice that tempered some of Churchill's more impractical schemes, his opposition to certain operations may have been excessively cautious. Churchill's strategic intuition sometimes proved correct despite professional military skepticism—for instance, in recognizing opportunities in peripheral theaters that Brooke initially opposed.

The publication of Brooke's unexpurgated diaries revealed a level of contempt for colleagues that some found unseemly. His harsh private judgments of Churchill, Eisenhower, Marshall, and others, while perhaps cathartic for a commander under enormous stress, displayed a lack of generosity toward those who were genuinely doing their best in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. The fact that he intended these diaries for publication (after initially saying otherwise) suggests a degree of score-settling that diminished his stature in some observers' eyes.

Brooke's relationship with the Combined Chiefs of Staff structure revealed parochial concerns about preserving British influence rather than genuinely seeking the most effective Allied command arrangements.[^97] His resistance to American dominance in combined operations, while understandable from a British national perspective, sometimes prioritized prestige over optimal military effectiveness.
