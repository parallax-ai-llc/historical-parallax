## Summary

Meister Eckhart was a German Dominican theologian, philosopher, and mystic whose teachings on the nature of God and the soul profoundly influenced Western mysticism. He taught at the University of Paris and preached extensively in German, making theology accessible to laypeople. His concept of Gelassenheit (detachment) anticipated later philosophical ideas. Some of his propositions were condemned posthumously by Pope John XXII.
