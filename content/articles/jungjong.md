## Summary

Jungjong (born April 16, 1488; died November 29, 1544) was the 11th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1506 to 1544.[^1] He came to power through the **Jungjong Coup** (Jungjong Banjeong), which overthrew his tyrannical half-brother, **Yeonsangun**. Jungjong's reign is defined by his ambitious attempt to reform the country through the neo-Confucian scholar **Jo Gwang-jo**, and the tragic failure of those reforms in the **Gimyo Sahwa** (purge). He is also known for the story of his first wife, **Queen Dangyeong** (the legend of the Chima Rock), and for employing the first female royal physician, **Dae Jang Geum**.[^2]

## The Reluctant King (Jungjong Banjeong)

In 1506, officials staged a coup to depose the tyrant Yeonsangun. They surrounded the house of Prince Jinseong (Jungjong).
*   **The Coup:** Fearing he was being arrested to be killed, he almost committed suicide, but his wife calmed him down. He was thrust onto the throne by the coup leaders, meaning his royal authority was initially very weak and dependent on the merit subjects (Hungu faction).[^3]
*   **Queen Dangyeong:** The coup leaders forced him to divorce his beloved wife, Queen Dangyeong, because her father was Yeonsangun's ally. The legend says she would hang her red skirt (chima) on a rock on Inwangsan Mountain so the King could see it from the palace.[^4]

## The Reformer Jo Gwang-jo

To counter the power of the corrupt Hungu faction, Jungjong recruited a radical young neo-Confucian scholar named **Jo Gwang-jo**.
*   **Radical Reforms:** Jo Gwang-jo implemented the *Hyangyak* (local self-government code), reformed the civil service exam (Hyeollyanggwa), and tried to confiscate the land/wealth of the coup leaders on the grounds they were undeserved.
*   **The King's Favorite:** For four years, Jo was the King's soulmate in governance, pushing for a moral ideal state.[^5]

## The Betrayal (Gimyo Sahwa)

The reforms went too fast. The Hungu faction felt threatened, and Jungjong himself grew tired of Jo Gwang-jo's strict moralizing.
*   **The Leaf Plot:** The Hungu faction wrote "Jo will become King" (Ju-Cho-Wi-Wang) in honey on leaves, which were eaten by caterpillars to reveal the message. They showed this to the paranoid King.
*   **The Purge (1519):** In a swift betrayal, Jungjong ordered the execution of Jo Gwang-jo and the purge of his followers (Gimyo Sahwa). The reform movement collapsed.[^6]

## Later Reign and Dae Jang Geum

Jungjong's later reign was plagued by factional fighting and external threats.
*   **Dae Jang Geum:** He is famous in popular culture for trusting a female physician, **Jang Geum**, to be his personal doctor, granting her the title "Dae" (Great), a revolutionary act in Confucian Joseon.[^7]
