## Summary

Lee Teng-hui (1923-2020) served as the President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 1988 to 2000, becoming the first native Taiwanese to hold the position and earning the title "Father of Taiwan's Democracy."[^1] An agricultural economist by training, Lee transformed Taiwan from an authoritarian one-party state under the Kuomintang (KMT) into a vibrant multi-party democracy through peaceful constitutional reforms.[^2] His presidency marked a pivotal period in Taiwan's history, characterized by democratic liberalization, the first direct presidential elections in Chinese history, and increasingly assertive assertions of Taiwanese identity that fundamentally altered cross-strait relations.[^3] Despite facing significant opposition from both conservative elements within his own party and from Beijing, Lee successfully navigated Taiwan through a critical transition period, though his policies remain controversial and his legacy is viewed differently across the political spectrum.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Lee Teng-hui was born on January 15, 1923, in Sanzhi, Taipei Prefecture, during the Japanese colonial period of Taiwan (1895-1945).[^5] His birth came at a time when Taiwan had been under Japanese rule for nearly three decades, profoundly shaping his formative years and worldview. Born into a Hakka and Hoklo family, Lee grew up speaking Japanese and Taiwanese Hokkien, receiving his primary and secondary education entirely in Japanese institutions.[^6] His family background was relatively modest, with his father working as a police officer during the colonial period.[^7]

The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on Lee's character and thinking. He attended the prestigious Taipei Higher School (now National Taiwan Normal University) and later enrolled at Kyoto Imperial University in Japan, where he studied agricultural economics.[^8] During his time in Japan, Lee was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army in 1944, serving during the final year of World War II.[^9] This complex relationship with Japanese colonial rule—experiencing both its modernizing influences and its discriminatory aspects—would later inform his nuanced views on Taiwan's history and identity.

After Japan's surrender in 1945, Taiwan was transferred to the Republic of China government. Lee returned to Taiwan and completed his studies at National Taiwan University, earning a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics in 1948.[^10] The traumatic 228 Incident of 1947, in which the KMT government violently suppressed Taiwanese protests, occurred during this period and deeply affected Lee, though he remained relatively quiet about it for decades.[^11] He continued his academic pursuits, studying at Iowa State University where he earned a master's degree in 1953, and later at Cornell University, where he completed his Ph.D. in agricultural economics in 1968.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Lee Teng-hui's political ascent was gradual and, in many ways, unexpected. He began his career as an agricultural economist and academic, working for the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction and teaching at National Taiwan University.[^13] His expertise in agricultural economics and rural development caught the attention of government officials during a period when Taiwan was transitioning from an agricultural to an industrial economy.[^14] In 1971, Lee was appointed to a cabinet-level position without portfolio, marking his entry into formal politics.[^15]

His political career accelerated when he was appointed Mayor of Taipei in 1978, a position he held until 1981.[^16] During this time, Lee demonstrated administrative competence and began building relationships with key figures in the Kuomintang party. His Taiwanese background made him valuable to the KMT leadership, which sought to cultivate native Taiwanese talent to counter accusations of mainlander dominance in the party.[^17] In 1981, he was appointed Governor of Taiwan Province, the highest provincial position, where he served with distinction until 1984.[^18]

The turning point in Lee's career came in 1984 when President Chiang Ching-kuo, seeking to promote Taiwanese representation and prepare for eventual succession, selected Lee as his vice president.[^19] This decision was controversial within the KMT, as many powerful mainlander politicians had aspired to the position. However, Chiang Ching-kuo was determined to prevent his own family from succeeding him and to ensure a smooth transition that would include native Taiwanese in top leadership positions.[^20] When Chiang Ching-kuo died suddenly on January 13, 1988, Lee Teng-hui, in accordance with the constitution, succeeded him as president—becoming the first native Taiwanese to lead the Republic of China.[^21]

Lee's early presidency was precarious. He faced significant opposition from powerful conservative factions within the KMT, particularly the so-called "non-mainstream faction" led by Premier Hau Pei-tsun and other mainlander politicians who viewed Lee as a transitional figure.[^22] However, Lee proved to be a shrewd political operator, systematically consolidating power by building alliances, promoting loyalists, and outmaneuvering his opponents.[^23] By 1990, he had secured his position sufficiently to be elected by the National Assembly to a full six-year term as president.[^24]

## Major Achievements

Lee Teng-hui's presidency is most celebrated for his democratic reforms, which fundamentally transformed Taiwan's political system. Upon assuming office, Taiwan was still under martial law provisions that had been in place since 1949, though martial law itself had been lifted in 1987.[^25] Lee accelerated the democratization process initiated by his predecessor, overseeing the retirement of the "eternal parliamentarians"—legislators elected in mainland China in 1947 who had never faced re-election.[^26] This reform, completed in 1991-1992, was crucial for establishing genuinely representative democratic institutions.[^27]

The crowning achievement of Lee's democratic reforms came in 1996 when Taiwan held its first direct presidential election in Chinese history.[^28] This election, which Lee won decisively with 54% of the vote despite military threats from China, marked Taiwan's transition to a full democracy.[^29] Lee's willingness to compete in a direct election and accept the possibility of defeat demonstrated his genuine commitment to democratic principles, distinguishing him from many authoritarian leaders who promise democratization but resist relinquishing power.[^30]

Beyond constitutional reforms, Lee presided over a period of significant economic development and internationalization. Taiwan's economy continued to grow robustly during his presidency, with the country becoming one of the "Asian Tigers" and a major player in global technology manufacturing.[^31] Lee promoted economic liberalization, reduced restrictions on capital movement, and encouraged Taiwanese businesses to invest globally, including cautiously in mainland China.[^32] Under his leadership, Taiwan's per capita GDP increased substantially, and the economy successfully transitioned from labor-intensive manufacturing to high-tech industries.[^33]

Lee also pursued an assertive foreign policy that came to be known as "pragmatic diplomacy" or "vacation diplomacy."[^34] Recognizing that Taiwan's formal diplomatic space was severely constrained by the One China policy, Lee embarked on numerous unofficial visits to countries that did not recognize the ROC, including a controversial 1995 visit to Cornell University that triggered a crisis with China.[^35] He sought to raise Taiwan's international profile, secure participation in international organizations, and strengthen relationships with democratic nations, particularly the United States and Japan.[^36]

In the cultural and social sphere, Lee encouraged the development of a distinct Taiwanese identity and the use of local languages. He was the first president to regularly speak Taiwanese Hokkien in public settings, breaking from the Mandarin-only tradition of previous administrations.[^37] This linguistic shift symbolized a broader embrace of Taiwan's unique history and culture, distinguishing it from mainland China.[^38] Lee also promoted native Taiwanese culture, supported historical research into Taiwan's past, and encouraged open discussion of previously taboo subjects like the 228 Incident.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Lee Teng-hui's presidency and legacy remain deeply controversial, attracting criticism from multiple directions. From Beijing's perspective, Lee is considered a dangerous separatist who betrayed his Chinese heritage and pushed Taiwan toward formal independence.[^40] His 1999 statement describing cross-strait relations as "special state-to-state relations" provoked particular fury in China, as it implicitly rejected the notion that Taiwan was part of "one China."[^41] The Chinese government accused Lee of being the "splitter-in-chief" and held him personally responsible for deteriorating cross-strait relations during the 1990s.[^42]

Within Taiwan, conservative elements of the KMT never forgave Lee for what they viewed as his betrayal of party principles and Chinese nationalism. Critics accused him of opportunistically abandoning the party's founding ideology of eventual reunification with mainland China.[^43] His systematic purge of rivals within the KMT, particularly mainlander politicians, was seen by some as divisive and driven by ethnic resentment rather than principle.[^44] In 2001, the KMT expelled Lee from the party he had once led, a remarkable denunciation that reflected the depth of the split he had caused.[^45]

Lee's democratic credentials, while generally praised, also face criticism. Some scholars argue that his reforms were as much about consolidating personal power as about genuine democratization, pointing to his authoritarian tendencies and willingness to use state resources for political purposes.[^46] His administration faced allegations of corruption, including the "Yin Ching-feng case" involving a naval officer's mysterious death that some linked to naval procurement scandals.[^47] Critics also note that Lee maintained and exercised significant executive power, sometimes circumventing normal democratic processes.[^48]

The "black gold" politics that flourished during Lee's presidency—referring to corruption and organized crime's influence in politics—remains a significant stain on his legacy.[^49] While not personally implicated in most scandals, Lee was accused of tolerating or even encouraging factional politics and vote-buying to maintain his political coalition.[^50] His factional maneuvering within the KMT, while politically effective, contributed to the party's internal divisions and eventual loss of power in 2000.[^51]

Economically, critics argue that Lee's policies contributed to rising inequality and failed to address structural problems in Taiwan's economy. The liberalization of cross-strait economic relations, while beneficial to large businesses, allegedly disadvantaged small and medium enterprises and workers.[^52] His administration is also criticized for failing to implement necessary reforms in areas like labor law, environmental protection, and social welfare.[^53]

## Personal Life

Lee Teng-hui married Tseng Wen-hui in 1949, and their marriage lasted until his death in 2020, spanning over 70 years.[^54] Tseng, the daughter of a wealthy Taiwanese family, provided important social and financial support during Lee's early career.[^55] The couple had three children—two daughters and a son—though their eldest son, Lee Hsien-wen, died in 1982 under circumstances that remain mysterious, reportedly from a heart condition, though some have speculated about other causes.[^56] This family tragedy deeply affected Lee and is said to have influenced his later political decisions.[^57]

Lee was known for his intellectual interests and scholarly demeanor. An avid reader, he maintained academic habits throughout his political career, frequently citing economic theory, political philosophy, and historical works in his speeches and writings.[^58] He was particularly influenced by Japanese philosophy and Christian theology, having converted to Christianity in his youth.[^59] His Christian faith, particularly his Presbyterian affiliation, was significant both personally and politically, as the Presbyterian Church in Taiwan has historically supported Taiwanese identity and self-determination.[^60]

Personally, Lee was described by associates as complex and sometimes contradictory—publicly genial but privately calculating, idealistic about democracy but pragmatic in political maneuvering.[^61] He was known for his subtle communication style, often speaking in indirect terms and metaphors that required interpretation.[^62] This communication style reflected both traditional Chinese political culture and his own cautious approach to sensitive political issues.[^63]

Lee's multilingualism—fluency in Japanese, Taiwanese Hokkien, Hakka, and Mandarin—reflected his complex identity and enabled him to connect with different constituencies.[^64] He was most comfortable speaking Japanese and Taiwanese, and his frequent use of these languages in public was both a personal preference and a political statement about Taiwanese identity.[^65] In retirement, Lee remained publicly active, writing books, giving speeches, and commenting on political issues, though his influence waned as new generations of politicians emerged.[^66]

---

## Legacy

Lee Teng-hui's legacy is most enduringly embodied in Taiwan's vibrant democracy. The constitutional reforms and democratic institutions he established have proven remarkably durable, surviving multiple peaceful transfers of power between different political parties.[^67] Taiwan's transformation from authoritarian rule to democracy is frequently cited as one of the most successful democratic transitions of the late 20th century, and Lee is widely credited as the principal architect of this transition.[^68] The democratic norms and practices he established—including direct elections, freedom of speech, and competitive multiparty politics—have become deeply embedded in Taiwanese political culture.[^69]

Lee's impact on Taiwanese identity formation may be equally significant. His presidency coincided with and accelerated a fundamental shift in how Taiwan's residents viewed themselves, with increasing numbers identifying as "Taiwanese" rather than "Chinese" or "both."[^70] While demographic and generational changes contributed to this shift, Lee's public embrace of Taiwanese identity, his promotion of local languages and culture, and his implicit challenge to Chinese nationalism provided political legitimacy and leadership to these emerging sentiments.[^71] This transformation of identity has profound implications for cross-strait relations and Taiwan's political future.[^72]

In the realm of cross-strait relations, Lee's legacy is more contested. His policies unquestionably increased tensions with mainland China and established a precedent of assertive defense of Taiwan's autonomy that subsequent presidents have followed to varying degrees.[^73] Whether this should be viewed positively or negatively depends largely on one's perspective on Taiwan's ultimate political status. Supporters argue that Lee stood up for Taiwan's dignity and interests against Chinese pressure; critics contend that he unnecessarily provoked Beijing and foreclosed possibilities for peaceful accommodation.[^74]

Lee's influence on Taiwan's political landscape extends through the politicians he mentored and promoted, many of whom went on to prominent careers. Chen Shui-bian, Taiwan's first Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) president, benefited from the democratic system Lee established.[^75] Ma Ying-jeou, despite representing the KMT faction that opposed Lee, operated within the democratic framework Lee created.[^76] Current political leaders across the spectrum acknowledge, whether positively or negatively, that they are operating in the political environment Lee shaped.[^77]

Internationally, Lee elevated Taiwan's profile and established models for Taiwan's international participation that continue to be used. The informal diplomatic approaches, emphasis on shared democratic values with Western nations, and integration into global economic networks that Lee pioneered remain central to Taiwan's foreign policy strategy.[^78] His example of successful democratic transition has also been studied by other nations and movements seeking to liberalize authoritarian systems.[^79]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and commentators who view Lee positively emphasize his crucial role in democratizing Taiwan without bloodshed or social upheaval. Political scientist Larry Diamond has described Taiwan's democratization as "one of the great success stories of the third wave of democratization," crediting Lee's leadership as essential to this outcome.[^80] Democracy researchers frequently cite Lee's willingness to subject himself to direct election in 1996 as exemplary democratic leadership, contrasting it with leaders who promise democracy but avoid genuine electoral accountability.[^81]

Admirers emphasize Lee's political courage in confronting both internal opposition from conservative KMT factions and external pressure from China. Historian Bruce Jacobs argues that Lee "showed remarkable political skill in outmaneuvering his opponents while maintaining the support of the Taiwanese people."[^82] His ability to navigate Taiwan through a potentially volatile transition period while maintaining economic growth and social stability is seen as a significant achievement.[^83]

Supporters also praise Lee's contribution to establishing Taiwanese identity as legitimate and worthy of respect. Anthropologist Allen Chun notes that Lee "helped Taiwanese people develop confidence in their own identity and history, breaking from decades of imposed Chinese nationalism."[^84] This cultural-psychological transformation is viewed as necessary for Taiwan's democratic development and for creating a cohesive sense of political community.[^85]

From a human rights perspective, Lee's presidency saw dramatic improvements in civil liberties, including freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and freedom of the press.[^86] Human rights organizations documented significant progress in Taiwan's human rights situation during his tenure, noting the dismantling of authoritarian controls and the establishment of legal protections for individual rights.[^87] The peaceful resolution of historical injustices, including official acknowledgment of the 228 Incident, is also credited to Lee's leadership.[^88]

International relations scholars who focus on democracy promotion frequently cite Lee's Taiwan as evidence that Chinese culture is not incompatible with democracy, countering cultural determinism arguments about authoritarianism in Asia.[^89] Lee himself is often quoted arguing that democracy is a universal value not limited to Western culture, a position that resonates with democracy advocates globally.[^90]

### Negative Views

Critics of Lee, particularly those committed to Chinese reunification, view him as an opportunistic politician who betrayed his responsibilities and caused lasting damage to cross-strait relations. Chinese scholar Wang Jisi argues that "Lee Teng-hui's separatist actions set back the cause of peaceful reunification by decades and created unnecessary antagonism between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait."[^91] From this perspective, Lee's abandonment of the "One China" framework was reckless and morally wrong, betraying the sacrifices of previous generations.[^92]

Some academic critics question the depth of Lee's democratic commitment, arguing that his reforms were primarily tactical moves to consolidate power rather than principled democratization. Political scientist Yun-han Chu has noted that "Lee showed authoritarian tendencies even while promoting democratic institutions, suggesting his commitment was more instrumental than normative."[^93] This criticism points to Lee's manipulation of factional politics, his tolerance of corruption, and his occasional disregard for procedural norms.[^94]

Scholars critical of identity politics argue that Lee's promotion of Taiwanese identity was divisive and created artificial distinctions that have polarized Taiwan's society. Sociologist Hsiau A-chin contends that "the ethnic division between 'Taiwanese' and 'mainlander' that Lee exploited and intensified has created lasting social divisions."[^95] From this perspective, Lee's identity politics sacrificed social harmony for political advantage, creating problems that persist in contemporary Taiwan.[^96]

Economic historians have criticized Lee's economic policies as insufficient and misdirected. Economist Tung Chen-yuan argues that "Lee failed to implement necessary structural reforms during a critical period, allowing problems like income inequality and industrial hollowing-out to worsen."[^97] Critics note that while Taiwan's economy grew during Lee's presidency, it also became more dependent on China and more vulnerable to global economic fluctuations.[^98]

Some international relations scholars argue that Lee's confrontational approach to China was strategically unwise and placed Taiwan in unnecessary danger. Political scientist Alan Wachman suggests that "Lee's provocative actions, particularly his 'state-to-state' formulation, backed China into a corner and made compromise more difficult."[^99] From this realist perspective, Lee should have been more accommodating to China's sensitivities while quietly strengthening Taiwan's autonomy, rather than publicly challenging Chinese positions.[^100]
