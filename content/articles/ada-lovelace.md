## Summary

Ada Lovelace was a British mathematician who is considered the first computer programmer. She wrote detailed notes on Charles Babbage's proposed Analytical Engine, including what is recognized as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Her insights anticipated that computers could go beyond mere calculation to create music and art. She was the daughter of the poet Lord Byron.
