## Summary

Carl June pioneered CAR-T cell therapy, a revolutionary cancer treatment that genetically engineers a patient's own immune cells to attack cancer. His first patient, Emily Whitehead (then age 6), was cured of leukemia in 2012 and remains cancer-free. CAR-T therapy has been approved for multiple blood cancers and represents a new paradigm in cancer treatment.
