## Overview

Mt. Gox was the world's first major Bitcoin exchange, handling over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions globally at its peak. Based in Tokyo and run by French developer Mark Karpelès, it was the primary gateway for early crypto adoption. In February 2014, the site abruptly went offline, filing for bankruptcy days later. The revelation was staggering: hackers had been siphoning funds for years, stealing approximately 850,000 Bitcoins (worth $450 million then; tens of billions today). The collapse was the first great trauma of the crypto age, teaching painful lessons about "not your keys, not your coins."

## Background

### Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange

**Origins:**
Founded in 2010 by Jed McCaleb as a trading site for *Magic: The Gathering* cards.
Converted to Bitcoin exchange.
Sold to **Mark Karpelès** (MagicalTux) in 2011.

**Dominance:**
By 2013, Mt. Gox WAS the market. If you bought BTC, you likely used Gox.

## The Hack(s)

### The Slow Bleed (2011-2014)

It wasn't one heist; it was a leaky bucket.
Hackers (suspected Alexander Vinnik / Russian groups) gained access to private keys as early as 2011.
They silently drained coins.

**Transaction Malleability:**
A bug in Bitcoin protocol (at the time) allowed hackers to alter transaction IDs to make it look like withdrawals failed, prompting Gox to resend coins. Gox's software was incompetent and kept resending.

### Willy Bot

As Gox ran out of real Bitcoin, an internal trading bot named "Willy" began buying massive amounts of BTC with non-existent fiat money to prop up the price/volume.

## The Collapse

### February 2014

**Withdrawal Freeze (Feb 7):**
Karpelès halted withdrawals. Blamed technical issues. Panic set in.

**Insolvency:**
Price on Gox crashed vs other exchanges.
Leaked "Crisis Strategy Draft" document revealed 744,408 BTC missing.

**Shutdown (Feb 24):**
Site went blank.

**Mark Karpelès Press Conference:**
Bowed deeply (Japanese apology style). Admitted "weaknesses in the system."

## Aftermath

### The Civil Rehabilitation

**200,000 BTC Found:**
Karpelès "found" an old cold wallet with 200,000 BTC later. This became the pot for repaying creditors.

**The Wait:**
Creditors waited **10 years** (repayments began 2024).
**Irony:** Because BTC price skyrocketed (from $450 to $60,000+), the found coins were worth massively more. However, strict Japanese bankruptcy laws initially pegged claims to 2014 Yen value (disaster). Later shifted to Civil Rehabilitation to allow BTC distribution.

### Mark Karpelès

**Arrarested 2015:**
Charged with embezzlement and data manipulation.
**Verdict:**
Cleared of embezzlement. Convicted of data manipulation (falsifying records). Suspended sentence.
Known for buying a Frappuccino daily during crisis. Currently runs unhackable OS startup.

### Alexander Vinnik

Russian operator of **BTC-e** exchange. Arrested in Greece (2017). Laundering hub for Gox coins. Extradited to US.

## Legacy

**Self-Custody:**
"Not your keys, not your coins" became mantra.
**Regulation:**
Japan became first country to strictly regulate crypto exchanges (FSA).
**Market Maturity:**
Crypto moved away from single points of failure.
