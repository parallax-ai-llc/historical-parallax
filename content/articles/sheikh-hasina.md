## Summary

Sheikh Hasina Wazed is a Bangladeshi politician who served as Prime Minister of Bangladesh for over two decades, making her one of the longest-serving leaders in the country's history. The daughter of Bangladesh's founding father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, she survived the brutal assassination of most of her family in 1975 and returned from exile to lead the Awami League. Her tenure saw significant economic growth and development in Bangladesh, transforming it from one of the world's poorest nations into a lower-middle-income country. However, her rule has been increasingly criticized for authoritarianism, human rights abuses, suppression of dissent, and allegations of rigged elections, culminating in her dramatic ouster and flight to India in August 2024 following massive student-led protests.

## Early Life and Background

Sheikh Hasina was born on September 28, 1947, in Tungipara, Gopalganj, in what was then British India and would soon become East Pakistan.[^1] She was born into one of the most prominent political families in Bengali history. Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, would go on to lead the Bengali nationalist movement and become the founding father of Bangladesh. Her mother, Sheikh Fazilatunnesa Mujib, came from a respected Bengali Muslim family.[^2]

Hasina grew up during a turbulent period of political awakening in East Pakistan. She witnessed firsthand her father's growing involvement in the movement for Bengali autonomy and later independence. She attended Dhaka University, where she was actively involved in student politics during the late 1960s, a period of intense political ferment in East Pakistan.[^3] She graduated with a bachelor's degree in Bengali literature in 1973, two years after Bangladesh achieved independence.

Her formative years were shaped by the Bengali Language Movement of 1952, the Six Point Movement of the 1960s, and ultimately the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. These events instilled in her a deep sense of Bengali nationalism and political consciousness. She married M.A. Wazed Miah, a prominent nuclear scientist, in 1968, and they had two children together.[^4]

The most traumatic event of her early life occurred on August 15, 1975, when military officers assassinated her father, mother, and most of her family members in a brutal coup. Hasina and her sister Sheikh Rehana survived only because they were abroad in West Germany at the time.[^5] This massacre would define her political trajectory and personal mission for the rest of her life.

## Rise to Power

Following the 1975 assassination, Sheikh Hasina lived in exile in India for six years. During this period, Bangladesh underwent significant political turbulence, with military rulers dominating the political landscape. The Awami League, her father's party, was left leaderless and demoralized.[^6] In 1981, while still in exile, Hasina was elected president of the Awami League, inheriting her father's political mantle despite having little direct political experience herself.

She returned to Bangladesh on May 17, 1981, to a massive reception of supporters, marking the beginning of her active political career.[^7] Her return was risky—the military government viewed her with suspicion, and she faced numerous obstacles and periods of house arrest. Throughout the 1980s, she led the opposition movement against the military dictatorship of General Hussain Muhammad Ershad, organizing protests, strikes, and mass movements.[^8]

The restoration of democracy in 1990, following a popular uprising that toppled Ershad, opened new opportunities for Hasina. However, her first electoral contest in 1991 resulted in defeat to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Khaleda Zia, the widow of General Ziaur Rahman (who had seized power after the 1975 coup).[^9] This began a bitter political rivalry between the two women that would dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades.

Hasina finally achieved power in the 1996 elections, becoming Prime Minister for the first time. Her initial term lasted until 2001, during which she focused on economic development, signed the Ganges Water Sharing Treaty with India, and worked to bring her father's killers to justice.[^10] After losing the 2001 election, she spent five years in opposition before returning to power in the 2008 elections with a landslide victory.

From 2009 onward, Sheikh Hasina consolidated her grip on power through successive elections in 2014, 2018, and 2024, though the credibility of these later elections was increasingly questioned by international observers and opposition parties.[^11]

## Major Achievements

Sheikh Hasina's most significant achievement has been presiding over Bangladesh's remarkable economic transformation. Under her leadership, Bangladesh's GDP grew consistently, with the country achieving lower-middle-income status in 2015.[^12] The ready-made garment industry expanded dramatically, making Bangladesh the world's second-largest garment exporter after China. Per capita income increased from around $700 in 2009 to over $2,500 by 2022.[^13]

Her government made substantial progress in human development indicators. Bangladesh achieved significant reductions in infant mortality, maternal mortality, and poverty rates during her tenure.[^14] The country met most of the Millennium Development Goals ahead of schedule and made progress toward the Sustainable Development Goals. Female education and empowerment improved notably, with Bangladesh achieving gender parity in primary and secondary education enrollment.[^15]

Infrastructure development was a major focus of Hasina's administration. Her government constructed the Padma Bridge, Bangladesh's longest bridge, completed entirely with domestic financing after the World Bank withdrew over corruption allegations.[^16] The bridge, opened in 2022, was hailed as a symbol of national pride and self-reliance. Her government also initiated numerous power plants, roads, and digital infrastructure projects.

Hasina demonstrated strong leadership on climate change issues, positioning Bangladesh as a vocal advocate for climate justice on the international stage. She established the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund and implemented adaptation programs for this low-lying nation vulnerable to sea-level rise and cyclones.[^17] Her government's disaster management systems received international recognition for reducing casualties from natural disasters.

In foreign policy, Hasina successfully balanced relations between India and China while maintaining ties with Western nations. She resolved the maritime boundary disputes with both India and Myanmar through international arbitration.[^18] Her government also took in nearly one million Rohingya refugees fleeing persecution in Myanmar, a humanitarian gesture that brought international attention, though the refugee crisis later became a political liability.[^19]

Her government made efforts to address the legacy of the 1971 Liberation War by establishing the International Crimes Tribunal to prosecute those accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the independence struggle. Several opposition leaders, primarily from Jamaat-e-Islami, were convicted and executed, though these trials were criticized by human rights organizations for procedural flaws.[^20]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Sheikh Hasina's rule has been increasingly characterized by authoritarian tendencies and systematic suppression of dissent. Human rights organizations have documented a pattern of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, and torture by security forces, particularly the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB).[^21] Hundreds of opposition activists, journalists, and ordinary citizens have reportedly been victims of these "crossfire" killings and disappearances. In 2021, the United States imposed sanctions on RAB and several of its officials for human rights violations.[^22]

The credibility of elections under Hasina's rule has been severely questioned. The 2014 election was boycotted by the main opposition BNP, resulting in over half the parliamentary seats being uncontested.[^23] The 2018 election was marred by widespread reports of vote rigging, stuffing of ballot boxes the night before polling, and intimidation of opposition supporters. International observers raised serious concerns about the fairness of the electoral process.[^24] The January 2024 election was similarly boycotted by opposition parties and described by critics as a sham election designed to perpetuate Hasina's rule.[^25]

Press freedom deteriorated dramatically under Hasina's government. Bangladesh's ranking in the World Press Freedom Index fell consistently, with the country ranked 165th out of 180 countries in 2024.[^26] The government used the draconian Digital Security Act (later replaced by the Cyber Security Act) to arrest journalists, bloggers, and critics on vague charges of spreading rumors or tarnishing the country's image. Prominent journalist Rozina Islam was arrested and tortured in custody, while photojournalist Shahidul Alam was detained and beaten for criticizing the government.[^27]

The opposition BNP and other parties faced systematic repression, with thousands of activists arrested on what they described as politically motivated charges. BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was convicted on corruption charges widely seen as politically motivated and imprisoned for years before being released on humanitarian grounds.[^28] Mass arrests, raids on opposition offices, and restrictions on political rallies became routine features of Hasina's rule.

Corruption remained endemic despite Hasina's promises to tackle it. Transparency International consistently ranked Bangladesh among the most corrupt countries in the world. Several major scandals emerged during her tenure, including the 2016 Bangladesh Bank heist where hackers stole $81 million, and numerous allegations of corruption in infrastructure projects.[^29] Family members and close associates of Hasina were accused of amassing vast wealth, though such allegations were never properly investigated.

Her government's handling of the Rohingya refugee crisis became increasingly controversial. After the initial humanitarian response, Bangladesh faced criticism for attempting to relocate refugees to the remote island of Bhasan Char despite safety concerns and for allegedly forcing repatriation.[^30] The government also restricted refugees' movements and livelihood opportunities, creating a humanitarian emergency.

The final crisis of Hasina's rule came in July-August 2024, when student protests against a controversial job quota system escalated into a broader anti-government movement. Her government's violent crackdown on peaceful protesters killed over 600 people according to some estimates, shocking the nation and international community.[^31] When the military refused to continue suppressing protests and indicated they would not support her, Hasina fled to India on August 5, 2024, ending her 15-year continuous rule.[^32]

## Personal Life

Sheikh Hasina married M.A. Wazed Miah, a renowned nuclear physicist, in 1968. Their marriage was reportedly a happy one, and Wazed Miah was known for staying away from politics and focusing on his scientific work. He died in 2009, shortly after Hasina returned to power. The couple had two children: Sajeeb Wazed Joy and Saima Wazed Putul.[^33]

Her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, is an IT consultant who has served as an unofficial advisor to his mother, particularly on technology matters. He has been influential in shaping the government's digital agenda and has often defended his mother's policies on social media and in international media. Her daughter, Saima Wazed, is a psychologist and autism activist who has worked with the World Health Organization.[^34]

Hasina has been described by those who know her as intelligent, determined, and possessing a strong will. She is known for her powerful oratory skills in Bengali and her ability to connect with rural audiences. However, critics describe her as increasingly authoritarian and intolerant of dissent, surrounding herself with sycophants who shield her from reality.[^35]

The trauma of losing her entire family in the 1975 massacre has profoundly shaped her personality and politics. She has often invoked her father's legacy and the sacrifices of her family in her political speeches. This personal tragedy gave her a sense of mission to preserve her father's legacy and to seek justice for his killers, which she finally achieved when several assassins were executed in 2010.[^36]

Hasina's relationship with her sister Sheikh Rehana, the only other survivor of the 1975 massacre, has remained close throughout her life. Rehana largely stayed out of politics but was a source of personal support. Her only surviving sibling, she represented Hasina's last direct family link to the tragic events that defined her life.[^37]

Despite her political hardness, Hasina has been known to show emotional vulnerability when discussing her murdered family members. She has written about her father and family in several books and articles, revealing a more personal side. She has lived a relatively simple lifestyle compared to some other leaders, though her family members have been accused of benefiting from her position.[^38]

## Legacy

Sheikh Hasina's legacy is deeply complex and contested. Her supporters credit her with transforming Bangladesh from a basket case into a developing economy with improving social indicators. The economic growth, infrastructure development, and poverty reduction achieved during her tenure are undeniable achievements that have changed millions of lives.[^39] Bangladesh's graduation from Least Developed Country status and its progress in human development occurred under her watch.

However, her legacy is severely tarnished by the authoritarian turn her rule took, particularly after 2014. The systematic dismantling of democratic institutions, suppression of free speech, manipulation of elections, and human rights abuses will be remembered as dark stains on her record.[^40] The violence unleashed against student protesters in 2024, which ultimately led to her downfall, may define how she is remembered by younger generations of Bangladeshis.

The manner of her departure—fleeing the country in the face of popular uprising—mirrors in some ways the fate of the military dictators she once opposed. This ironic parallel has not been lost on observers. Having started her political career as a victim of military violence and a champion of democracy, she ended it as an authoritarian ruler using military force against her own people.[^41]

Her economic achievements may prove more durable than her political legacy. The infrastructure, industries, and institutions built during her tenure will continue to benefit Bangladesh. However, whether the economic progress was because of her leadership or despite it, and whether it could have been achieved without the accompanying authoritarianism, remains a subject of debate.[^42]

Internationally, Hasina will be remembered as a prominent voice for climate justice and a leader who gave shelter to Rohingya refugees, even as her domestic human rights record came under increasing scrutiny. The contradiction between her international advocacy and domestic repression characterized much of her later years in power.[^43]

For the Awami League, her legacy is mixed. She rebuilt the party from the ashes of the 1975 massacre and led it to unprecedented electoral success. However, by making the party increasingly dependent on her personal authority and by tolerating corruption and sycophancy, she may have weakened its long-term institutional strength.[^44]

The historical parallel between Sheikh Hasina and her rival Khaleda Zia is striking—both were daughters or widows of military officers who became national leaders, both claimed to represent democracy while undermining it, and both became increasingly authoritarian. Their rivalry prevented the development of a healthy democratic culture in Bangladesh, with politics reduced to a zero-sum contest between two family dynasties.[^45]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic scholars argue that Sheikh Hasina's leadership was essential for Bangladesh's development and stability. They point to the sustained economic growth, poverty reduction, and human development achievements as evidence of effective governance.[^46] Economist Debapriya Bhattacharya, while critical of some policies, has acknowledged the real economic progress made during her tenure, noting that Bangladesh outperformed many regional peers in social indicators.[^47]

Her defenders argue that she operated in a difficult political environment with limited democratic traditions, facing an opposition that included Islamist extremists and collaborators from the 1971 war. They contend that strong measures were necessary to prevent chaos and maintain stability in a country prone to military coups and political violence.[^48] Some argue that Western criticisms of her human rights record fail to appreciate the security challenges Bangladesh faces.

Indian analysts and policymakers have generally viewed Hasina favorably, crediting her with eliminating anti-India insurgent bases in Bangladesh, improving bilateral relations, and providing transit corridors. From New Delhi's perspective, she was a reliable partner in a neighborhood where friendly governments are rare.[^49]

Some feminist scholars have noted the symbolic importance of a woman leading a Muslim-majority country for over two decades, even while critiquing specific policies. Her government's focus on female education and empowerment programs has had tangible benefits for women's rights in Bangladesh.[^50]

Development economists point to Bangladesh's success in the garment industry, microfinance, and poverty alleviation programs as models for other developing countries. While not all of this can be attributed to Hasina personally, her government provided the policy environment that allowed these sectors to flourish.[^51]

### Negative Views

Critics, including human rights organizations, opposition politicians, and many scholars, view Sheikh Hasina's rule as an increasingly authoritarian regime that systematically dismantled democratic institutions. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and other organizations have extensively documented extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions under her government.[^52]

The scholar Ali Riaz, a prominent expert on Bangladeshi politics, has described Hasina's Bangladesh as an "electoral autocracy" where elections are held but manipulated to ensure predetermined outcomes. He argues that she created a system of political monopoly that excluded genuine opposition and dissent.[^53] Other political scientists have noted that Bangladesh's democracy score deteriorated significantly during her tenure, with Freedom House downgrading the country to "not free" in 2021.[^54]

Journalists and media freedom advocates strongly criticize her government's assault on press freedom. The Committee to Protect Journalists has repeatedly highlighted Bangladesh as one of the worst countries for press freedom, with systematic harassment, arrest, and violence against journalists.[^55] The use of the Digital Security Act to silence critics has been condemned as a tool of repression.

Opposition politicians and activists describe her rule as a family dynasty that concentrated power and wealth in the hands of a small elite connected to the Awami League. They point to allegations of corruption involving her family members and close associates, arguing that she presided over a kleptocratic system.[^56]

International legal experts criticized the International Crimes Tribunal established to try war crimes from 1971 as falling short of international standards. While acknowledging the importance of accountability, they noted serious procedural flaws, lack of independence, and the appearance of victor's justice.[^57]

Even some who initially supported her have expressed disappointment at the authoritarian trajectory of her rule. Veteran journalist David Bergman, who worked in Bangladesh for years, documented how the promise of her 2008 election victory gave way to increasing repression and manipulation of democratic processes.[^58]

The violent suppression of the 2024 student protests drew condemnation from across the political spectrum, with even some former Awami League supporters describing it as indefensible. UN experts called for accountability for the killings, and many saw it as the final failure of her leadership.[^59]
