## Summary

Brigid of Kildare was one of Ireland's patron saints and the founder of the monastery of Kildare, one of the most important monastic institutions in early Irish Christianity. She may be partly based on a pre-Christian Celtic goddess. She is credited with many miracles and her cult spread widely across Ireland and Europe. She is one of the 'Three Patrons of Ireland' alongside Patrick and Columba.
