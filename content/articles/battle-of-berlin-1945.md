## Overview

The Battle of Berlin (April 16 – May 2, 1945) was the apocalyptic finale of World War II in Europe. The Soviet Red Army, having advanced 2,000 km from Moscow, launched a massive offensive to crush the last defenses of the Third Reich. While Western Allies (USA/UK) halted at the Elbe River, Stalin ordered Marshals Zhukov and Konev to take Berlin at any cost (fearing the West might take it first). The battle was a brutal cage match fought in a ruined city against desperate SS fanatics, elderly Volkssturm militia, and Hitler Youth children. It ended with the capture of the Reichstag and Hitler's suicide, signalling the end of the "Thousand Year Reich" after 12 years.

## The Battle Phases

### 1. Seelow Heights (April 16-19)
Zhukov launched a frontal assault on the high ground east of Berlin.
**Searchlights:** Zhukov used 140 massive searchlights to blind Germans before dawn. Usage backfired (reflected off smoke/dust, blinding Russians).
**Slaughter:** Germans held firm initially. Zhukov threw in reserve tank armies early.
Russian casualties: 30,000+ killed.
Result: Breakthrough achieved on Day 3.

### 2. Encirclement (April 20-24)
Soviet tanks raced to encircle the city.
**Hitler's Birthday (April 20):** Soviet artillery began shelling the city center. Did not stop until May 2.
**Steiner Attack:** Hitler ordered SS General Steiner to launch a pincer counter-attack. The unit existed only on paper.
Hitler's realization (Scened in *Downfall*): " The war is lost."

### 3. The City Fight (April 25-May 2)
**Tactics:** Soviets sent tanks down narrow rubbled streets.
**Panzerfaust:** German infantry armed with disposable anti-tank rockets decimated Soviet armor from cellars and roofs. 2,000 Soviet tanks lost in the city.
**Zoo Flak Tower:** Massive concrete fortress (Zoo station) with 128mm guns held out until end.
**Subway Flooding:** S-Bahn tunnels were flooded (possibly by SS to stop Russian advance), drowning civilians sheltering there.

## The Bunker and the End

### April 30: Death of Hitler
With Soviets 500 meters away (fighting for control of Potsdamer Platz), Adolf Hitler married Eva Braun, then they committed suicide.
- Hitler: Gunshot to temple + Cyanide.
- Braun: Cyanide.
Bodies burned in Chancellery garden.

### May 1: The Reichstag
Iconic target. Bitter fighting floor-by-floor.
**The Flag:** At 22:40, Mikhail Yegorov and Meliton Kantaria raised the Red Flag (Victory Banner No. 5) over the Reichstag dome.

### May 2: Surrender
General Helmuth Weidling broadcast surrender order.
"The Führer has committed suicide... abandoning us."

## Weapons

**Soviet:**
- **IS-2 (Josef Stalin):** Heavy tank with 122mm gun. Designed to kill Tigers.

- **Me 262:** First jet fighter. Too few to make difference.
