## Summary

Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev (1834-1907) was a Russian chemist and inventor who formulated the Periodic Law and created the first widely recognized periodic table of elements. His groundbreaking work in organizing chemical elements by atomic weight revealed periodic patterns that predicted the properties of undiscovered elements, revolutionizing chemistry and establishing principles still used today. Beyond his contributions to chemistry, Mendeleev was a passionate educator, economic reformer, and scientific advisor who shaped Russian industrial policy in the late 19th century. Despite his monumental scientific achievements, he faced personal struggles, academic controversies, and was notably denied the Nobel Prize due to political maneuvering. His legacy endures as one of the most influential scientists in history, with element 101 (mendelevium) named in his honor.

## Early Life and Background

Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev was born on February 8, 1834, in Tobolsk, Siberia, the youngest of at least 14 children (sources vary between 14 and 17) born to Ivan Pavlovich Mendeleev and Maria Dmitrievna Mendeleeva (née Kornilieva).[^1] His father was the director of the local gymnasium (secondary school) and a teacher of philosophy and fine arts, but became blind shortly after Dmitri's birth, forcing the family into financial hardship.[^2] His mother came from a merchant family that owned a glass factory, and she took over managing this business to support the family after her husband's incapacitation.[^3]

Tragedy struck the family repeatedly during Mendeleev's childhood. His father died in 1847 when Dmitri was only 13 years old, and the family's glass factory burned down in the same year, devastating their financial situation.[^4] Despite these hardships, Maria Mendeleeva was determined that her youngest son would receive a proper education. She recognized his intellectual potential and made extraordinary sacrifices to ensure his schooling.[^5]

In 1849, Maria took 15-year-old Dmitri on an arduous 1,300-mile journey from Siberia to Moscow, hoping to enroll him in the university there.[^6] However, because Dmitri had attended school in Siberia, Moscow University would not accept him due to regional enrollment restrictions.[^7] Undeterred, Maria traveled with him to St. Petersburg, where he was finally accepted into the Main Pedagogical Institute (where his father had studied) to study chemistry and pedagogy.[^8] Tragically, Maria died shortly after securing her son's admission, in the same year of 1850, having fulfilled her mission to ensure his education.[^9]

At the Pedagogical Institute, Mendeleev excelled in his studies despite initially poor health, including a diagnosis of tuberculosis that nearly ended his academic career.[^10] He studied under prominent scientists and developed a particular interest in chemistry, graduating in 1855 with a gold medal for his academic achievements.[^11] His early mentors included Aleksandr Voskresenskii, who introduced him to original chemical research, fostering the investigative approach that would characterize his career.[^12]

## Rise to Prominence

After graduating from the Main Pedagogical Institute in 1855, Mendeleev was appointed as a science master at the Simferopol gymnasium in Crimea, but the Crimean War forced him to relocate to Odessa.[^13] His health issues persisted, but he recovered sufficiently to return to St. Petersburg in 1856, where he began his academic career in earnest.[^14] He completed his master's degree in chemistry in 1856 with a thesis on the phenomenon of isomorphism and secured a position as a privatdozent (lecturer) at St. Petersburg University.[^15]

In 1859, Mendeleev received a government fellowship to study abroad, spending two years in Heidelberg, Germany, where he worked in his own laboratory and interacted with leading European chemists including Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff.[^16] During this period, he focused on capillarity and the critical temperature of gases, work that would later inform his understanding of atomic structure.[^17] In 1860, he attended the First International Chemical Congress in Karlsruhe, a pivotal event where Stanislao Cannizzaro presented his work on atomic weights—a presentation that profoundly influenced Mendeleev's thinking.[^18]

Returning to Russia in 1861, Mendeleev published his first textbook, "Organic Chemistry," which won the prestigious Demidov Prize from the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and established him as a leading chemical educator.[^19] In 1865, he completed his doctorate with a dissertation titled "On the Combinations of Water with Alcohol," which became the basis for Russia's vodka standards (though the popular myth that he invented vodka is false).[^20] That same year, at age 31, he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at St. Petersburg University, a position he would hold for three decades.[^21]

Mendeleev's true breakthrough came in the late 1860s while writing his comprehensive textbook "Principles of Chemistry."[^22] Faced with the challenge of organizing the known 63 elements in a logical manner, he began experimenting with different arrangements. On February 17, 1869, after intensive work—including, according to legend, a dream that revealed the pattern—Mendeleev produced the first draft of his periodic table, organizing elements by atomic weight and grouping those with similar properties.[^23] He presented this work to the Russian Chemical Society on March 6, 1869, in a paper titled "The Dependence between the Properties of the Atomic Weights of the Elements."[^24]

What distinguished Mendeleev's periodic table from other attempts at classification was his boldness in leaving gaps for undiscovered elements and predicting their properties with remarkable accuracy.[^25] He predicted the existence and properties of gallium (which he called "eka-aluminium"), scandium ("eka-boron"), and germanium ("eka-silicon")—all three were discovered within his lifetime with properties closely matching his predictions, vindicating his periodic law.[^26] This predictive power transformed the periodic table from a mere classification tool into a fundamental principle of chemistry.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Mendeleev's formulation of the Periodic Law and creation of the periodic table of elements stands as one of the most significant achievements in the history of science.[^28] Published in 1869 and refined throughout the 1870s, his periodic table organized the known elements by atomic weight while recognizing that properties recurred periodically.[^29] This insight revealed an underlying order to the chemical elements and provided a framework that would eventually be explained by quantum mechanics and atomic structure in the 20th century.[^30]

The power of Mendeleev's system became evident when his predictions were confirmed. In 1875, French chemist Paul-Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered gallium, which matched the properties Mendeleev had predicted for "eka-aluminium" with stunning accuracy—including its atomic weight, density, melting point, and chemical behavior.[^31] When Lecoq de Boisbaudran initially reported a density that didn't match Mendeleev's prediction, Mendeleev insisted on a remeasurement, and the Russian chemist proved correct.[^32] Similarly, scandium was discovered in 1879 by Lars Fredrik Nilson, matching "eka-boron," and germanium was discovered in 1886 by Clemens Winkler, matching "eka-silicon."[^33]

Beyond the periodic table, Mendeleev made significant contributions to multiple fields of chemistry and physics. His research on gases led to the formulation of what is sometimes called the Mendeleev-Clapeyron equation, an extension of the ideal gas law.[^34] His work on the critical temperature of gases and liquid solutions advanced physical chemistry and thermodynamics.[^35] His doctoral dissertation on alcohol-water solutions, while not actually establishing vodka standards, contributed to understanding solution chemistry and molecular interactions.[^36]

Mendeleev was also a prolific author and educator whose textbooks transformed chemical education. His "Principles of Chemistry" (Osnovy khimii), first published in 1868-1870 and revised through multiple editions, became one of the most influential chemistry textbooks of the 19th century, translated into numerous languages.[^37] The work went through eight Russian editions during his lifetime and shaped how chemistry was taught internationally.[^38] His clear, systematic presentation of chemical principles and his emphasis on the periodic law as an organizing framework established a pedagogical model still followed today.[^39]

In addition to his scientific work, Mendeleev played a crucial role in Russian industrial development. He served as a scientific advisor to the Russian government on various matters, including the development of the oil industry, coal resources, and industrial manufacturing.[^40] In 1893, he was appointed Director of the Bureau of Weights and Measures, where he worked to standardize Russian measurements and align them with international standards.[^41] He traveled extensively to study industrial processes in other countries, particularly focusing on petroleum production in Pennsylvania, and his recommendations shaped Russian economic policy.[^42]

Mendeleev advocated strongly for protectionist tariffs to develop Russian industry, arguing in his 1891 work "The Tariff" that Russia needed to protect emerging industries from foreign competition.[^43] He promoted the development of Russian oil fields in Baku and studied coal deposits in the Donets Basin, contributing to Russia's industrialization.[^44] His economic writings, while less celebrated than his scientific work, reflected his belief that science should serve national development and practical needs.[^45]

Throughout his career, Mendeleev received numerous honors and memberships in scientific societies worldwide. He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences (though only in 1882, surprisingly late given his achievements), the Royal Society of London, and academies across Europe and America.[^46] He received the Copley Medal from the Royal Society in 1905, one of science's highest honors.[^47] The element mendelevium (atomic number 101) was named in his honor in 1955, cementing his legacy in the very periodic table he created.[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his monumental contributions to science, Mendeleev's career was marked by significant controversies and setbacks. The most notable controversy involved his denial of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1906, Mendeleev was nominated for the Nobel Prize, and the Swedish Academy's committee recommended him for his work on the periodic table.[^49] However, committee member Svante Arrhenius opposed the nomination, arguing that Mendeleev's discovery was too old (from 1869) and that periodic relationships had been noticed by others before him.[^50] The prize that year went instead to Henri Moissan for isolating fluorine, a decision many historians of science consider one of the Nobel Committee's greatest mistakes.[^51] Mendeleev died the following year without receiving the prize, though he remained stoic about the snub.[^52]

Mendeleev's academic career ended in controversy as well. In 1890, he was forced to resign from St. Petersburg University after 25 years of service due to a conflict with the Minister of Education.[^53] Mendeleev had acted as an intermediary, delivering student demands for reforms to the minister, a politically risky action during a period of student unrest and government crackdown.[^54] When the minister rejected the demands, Mendeleev submitted his resignation in protest, and it was accepted despite his protests and later attempts to retract it.[^55] This dismissal from the university that had been his professional home was deeply painful, though he continued his scientific work independently and through his subsequent government positions.[^56]

His personal life also generated controversy, particularly his divorce and remarriage. In 1862, Mendeleev had married Feozva Nikitichna Leshcheva in what was largely an arranged marriage.[^57] The marriage was unhappy, and in 1876, at age 43, Mendeleev met and fell in love with Anna Ivanova Popova, a 19-year-old art student.[^58] Despite Russian Orthodox Church law requiring a seven-year waiting period after divorce, Mendeleev divorced Feozva in 1882 and married Anna the same year, technically making him a bigamist under church law.[^59] This violation of ecclesiastical law caused scandal in conservative Russian society, though Mendeleev's fame protected him from serious consequences.[^60] When critics pointed out his illegal marital status, Tsar Alexander III reportedly quipped, "Mendeleev has two wives, yes, but I have only one Mendeleev."[^61]

Mendeleev's scientific work also faced criticism and priority disputes. The German chemist Lothar Meyer independently developed a periodic table in 1870, leading to debates about priority, though Meyer's table lacked the predictive power of Mendeleev's version.[^62] British chemist John Newlands had proposed a "Law of Octaves" in 1865, arranging elements by atomic weight and noting periodic repetition, but his work was initially ridiculed and only later recognized as a precursor to the periodic law.[^63] Mendeleev was sometimes criticized for not adequately acknowledging earlier efforts, though his system was demonstrably more comprehensive and predictive.[^64]

Some of Mendeleev's scientific positions proved incorrect or outdated. He initially resisted the idea that elements could be subdivided, opposing the discovery of subatomic particles and the work of physicists like J.J. Thomson on the electron.[^65] He was skeptical of radioactivity and the transmutation of elements demonstrated by Ernest Rutherford and Frederick Soddy, viewing these discoveries as threats to the immutability of elements that underlay his periodic system.[^66] His resistance to atomic theory and the modern understanding of atomic structure showed that even great scientists can be conservative when new paradigms challenge their life's work.[^67]

Mendeleev also held views on race and society that reflected the prejudices of his era. He believed in a hierarchy of civilizations and nations, viewing Western European culture as advanced and expressing less favorable views of non-European peoples.[^68] While these attitudes were common among 19th-century scientists and intellectuals, they represent a troubling aspect of his worldview that must be acknowledged alongside his scientific achievements.[^69]

## Personal Life

Dmitri Mendeleev's personal life was complex and often turbulent, marked by passionate relationships, family devotion, and eclectic interests beyond chemistry. His first marriage to Feozva Nikitichna Leshcheva in 1862 produced three children: Maria (Masha), Vladimir, and Olga.[^70] However, the marriage was reportedly cold and unfulfilling, with Mendeleev later describing it as a mistake made under family pressure.[^71] His wife and he lived increasingly separate lives, and Mendeleev poured his emotional energy into his scientific work.[^72]

His second marriage to Anna Ivanova Popova in 1882, despite its scandalous circumstances, was apparently much happier.[^73] Anna was intelligent, artistic, and supportive of his work, and they had four children together: Lyubov, Ivan, and twins Vasily and Maria.[^74] Anna created a warm intellectual atmosphere in their home, hosting gatherings of scientists, artists, and writers.[^75] His daughter Lyubov from this marriage later became the wife of the famous Russian poet Alexander Blok, linking Mendeleev's family to Russia's cultural elite.[^76]

Mendeleev was known for his distinctive appearance, particularly in his later years. He had long, wild hair and a thick beard that he reportedly cut only once a year, giving him a somewhat prophetic or eccentric appearance.[^77] Contemporary accounts describe him as energetic, passionate, and sometimes temperamental, with a commanding presence in the lecture hall.[^78] He was an engaging teacher who used dramatic demonstrations and clear explanations, inspiring students with his enthusiasm for chemistry.[^79]

Beyond science, Mendeleev had diverse interests and hobbies. He was an accomplished craftsman who made his own luggage and bookbinding, finding relaxation in handiwork.[^80] He had a passion for travel, both for scientific purposes and personal enjoyment, visiting Western Europe, the United States, and various regions of Russia.[^81] He enjoyed the arts, particularly through his wife Anna's connections to the artistic community, and attended theater, concerts, and art exhibitions.[^82]

Mendeleev was also famously fond of playing solitaire (patience), often using the game as a way to relax and think through scientific problems.[^83] Colleagues and students reported seeing him at his desk surrounded by papers and books, periodically turning to arrange cards as he contemplated chemical puzzles.[^84] This habit reflects his systematic, pattern-seeking mind—the same cognitive style that led him to discover the periodic patterns in the elements.[^85]

Despite his fame, Mendeleev maintained a relatively modest lifestyle and was known for his accessibility to students and junior colleagues. He mentored numerous chemists who went on to significant careers, and his laboratory was a center of chemical research in Russia.[^86] However, he could also be demanding and critical, expecting high standards from himself and others.[^87] His resignation from St. Petersburg University, while principled, also reflected his stubborn nature and unwillingness to compromise on matters of conscience.[^88]

In his final years, Mendeleev remained intellectually active despite declining health. He continued to work at the Bureau of Weights and Measures and revised editions of his textbooks.[^89] He suffered from influenza in early 1907, which developed into pneumonia, and he died on February 2, 1907, at age 72, in St. Petersburg, surrounded by his family.[^90] Thousands attended his funeral, with students carrying a large periodic table in the procession, a fitting tribute to his greatest achievement.[^91]

## Legacy

Dmitri Mendeleev's legacy in science is immeasurable, with the periodic table remaining the central organizing principle of chemistry more than 150 years after its creation.[^92] Every chemistry classroom, laboratory, and textbook in the world displays some version of the periodic table, making it arguably the most widely recognized scientific diagram in existence.[^93] While the modern periodic table has been refined—organized by atomic number rather than atomic weight, incorporating the discoveries of noble gases, lanthanides, and actinides—the fundamental periodic law Mendeleev discovered remains valid.[^94]

The predictive power of Mendeleev's periodic law continues to guide chemical research. Beyond the elements he predicted (gallium, scandium, germanium), his framework anticipated the existence of the entire noble gas group (helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, radon), which were unknown when he first published his table.[^95] When William Ramsay discovered argon in 1894, Mendeleev initially doubted it but then recognized that an entire new group should exist, and the periodic table was expanded to accommodate these elements without destroying its structure.[^96] This adaptability demonstrated the robustness of the periodic law.[^97]

The discovery of atomic structure in the early 20th century provided the theoretical foundation for Mendeleev's empirical observations. When Henry Moseley determined atomic numbers in 1913, showing that properties depend on the number of protons rather than atomic weight, it perfected rather than replaced Mendeleev's system.[^98] Quantum mechanics explained why the periods have lengths of 2, 8, 18, and 32 elements—these numbers correspond to electron shell configurations—giving a physical basis to patterns Mendeleev observed purely through chemical behavior.[^99] Thus, his empirical discovery anticipated and was validated by theoretical developments he could not have imagined.[^100]

Mendeleev's influence on chemistry education has been equally profound. His textbook "Principles of Chemistry" established the model of organizing chemical knowledge around the periodic law, a pedagogical approach that remains standard.[^101] Modern chemistry education still follows his example of using the periodic table as a framework for understanding elemental properties, chemical bonding, and reactivity patterns.[^102] The clarity and systematic nature of his presentation set a standard for scientific communication that influenced generations of textbook authors.[^103]

Beyond chemistry, Mendeleev's work influenced Russian science and industry. His efforts to develop Russian petroleum, coal, and manufacturing sectors contributed to late Imperial Russia's industrialization.[^104] The Bureau of Weights and Measures that he directed became a model for standards institutions and played a crucial role in modernizing Russian commerce and science.[^105] His advocacy for science-based economic policy and industrial development reflected an early vision of the role scientists could play in national development.[^106]

Element 101, mendelevium (Md), was named in his honor in 1955 by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who first synthesized it.[^107] This rare distinction—having an element named after oneself—places Mendeleev among a small group of scientists commemorated in the periodic table itself, alongside Einstein (einsteinium), Curie (curium), Fermi (fermium), and others.[^108] The naming ensures that as long as chemistry is practiced, Mendeleev's name will be spoken.[^109]

Russia has honored Mendeleev's memory extensively. His image appeared on Soviet and Russian stamps, coins, and currency.[^110] The Russian Chemical Society was renamed the Mendeleev Russian Chemical Society in his honor.[^111] St. Petersburg State University, from which he was controversially dismissed, later celebrated him as one of its most distinguished faculty members, with monuments and museums dedicated to his work.[^112] Numerous streets, institutions, and scientific prizes bear his name throughout Russia and the former Soviet Union.[^113]

Internationally, Mendeleev is celebrated as one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century, frequently ranked alongside Darwin, Maxwell, and Pasteur.[^114] The International Year of the Periodic Table was celebrated in 2019, marking 150 years since Mendeleev's first publication of the periodic law, with events organized by UNESCO, IUPAC, and scientific organizations worldwide.[^115] Scholarly studies continue to analyze his work methods, his thought processes, and the historical context of his discovery.[^116]

Perhaps Mendeleev's greatest legacy is demonstrating that empirical observation, systematic organization, and bold prediction can reveal deep natural laws even without complete theoretical understanding. He discovered the periodic law through careful analysis of empirical data, pattern recognition, and intuitive leaps, decades before the physics that explains it was developed.[^117] This achievement exemplifies the power of the scientific method and the possibility of discovering fundamental truths through systematic study of nature.[^118]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Mendeleev is almost universally celebrated in the history of science as one of the most brilliant and influential chemists who ever lived. Historians of chemistry consistently rank the discovery of the periodic law among the most important achievements in the field, with many considering it the foundation of modern chemistry.[^119] The chemist and historian William H. Brock wrote that Mendeleev's periodic table "proved to be one of the most fruitful generalizations in the whole of science," transforming chemistry from a descriptive discipline into a predictive science.[^120]

Scientists emphasize the extraordinary boldness and insight required for Mendeleev's achievement. Not only did he organize known elements, but he corrected previously accepted atomic weights when they didn't fit his pattern, and he left gaps for unknown elements while predicting their properties with remarkable precision.[^121] Eric Scerri, a leading historian of the periodic table, argues that Mendeleev's willingness to prioritize chemical periodicity over strict ordering by atomic weight showed scientific courage and deep understanding of chemical principles.[^122] The vindication of his predictions within his lifetime—particularly germanium, which matched his "eka-silicon" predictions almost exactly—demonstrated scientific prophecy of the highest order.[^123]

Educational theorists praise Mendeleev not just as a discoverer but as a master teacher and communicator of science. His textbooks combined rigorous treatment of chemical principles with clear explanations and a unifying framework, making complex material accessible without sacrificing depth.[^124] His teaching style, emphasizing demonstration, systematic organization, and the connection between theory and experiment, influenced chemistry education worldwide.[^125] The Russian chemist and historian Lev Chugaev wrote that Mendeleev "was not only a great scientist but also a great teacher who opened the eyes of chemists to a new world."[^126]

Mendeleev is also celebrated for his interdisciplinary approach and practical application of science. Unlike some pure theorists, he engaged with economics, industry, and public policy, using his scientific expertise to address practical problems.[^127] His work on Russian industrial development, petroleum resources, and standardization demonstrated that scientific excellence and public service were compatible, even complementary.[^128] Biographer Michael Gordin argues that Mendeleev embodied the ideal of the "civic scientist" who contributes both to knowledge and to society.[^129]

Russian and Soviet historians have particularly emphasized Mendeleev's patriotism and service to Russia, celebrating him as a national hero who brought glory to Russian science.[^130] During the Soviet period, he was promoted as an example of Russian scientific genius, though his religious views and economic liberalism were downplayed.[^131] Post-Soviet assessments have been more balanced but remain deeply proud of his achievements as representing Russian intellectual contributions to world science.[^132]

The Royal Society of London, in awarding Mendeleev the Copley Medal in 1905, stated that his periodic law had "afforded an invaluable guide in chemistry" and represented "one of the greatest generalizations in science."[^133] This recognition from one of the world's most prestigious scientific bodies, just two years before his death, affirmed the international significance of his work.[^134]

### Negative Views

While Mendeleev is generally celebrated, some historians and scientists have raised criticisms and qualifications regarding his work and legacy. A significant criticism concerns the question of priority and originality. Several chemists before Mendeleev recognized periodic relationships among elements, including Alexandre-Émile Béguyer de Chancourtois, who created a spiral periodic system in 1862, and John Newlands, who proposed the Law of Octaves in 1864.[^135] Lothar Meyer developed a periodic table independently around the same time as Mendeleev, and some historians argue that Meyer's contributions have been unfairly overshadowed.[^136]

Critics point out that Mendeleev was not always generous in acknowledging predecessors and contemporaries. He rarely cited earlier attempts at periodic classification and sometimes dismissed them curtly.[^137] The historian J.W. van Spronsen, in his comprehensive history of the periodic table, argues that while Mendeleev's version was superior in predictive power, the historical narrative has exaggerated his sole authorship and minimized the contributions of others.[^138] The scientific community's focus on Mendeleev as "the" discoverer of the periodic table reflects a tendency toward hero worship rather than acknowledging the collective nature of scientific progress.[^139]

Some scholars criticize aspects of Mendeleev's scientific methodology and his resistance to new discoveries. His rejection of subatomic particles, skepticism about radioactivity, and opposition to the transmutation of elements showed that he was wedded to 19th-century concepts of immutable atoms.[^140] The historian Helge Kragh notes that Mendeleev's "conservative attitude toward the new atomic physics" put him at odds with the revolutionary developments in science at the turn of the 20th century.[^141] While this is understandable given his age and the foundation of his life's work, it demonstrates that great scientists are not immune to resistance when paradigms shift.[^142]

From a modern perspective, Mendeleev's economic and political views have received criticism. His advocacy for protectionist tariffs, while intended to develop Russian industry, aligned with nationalist economic policies that some economists argue hindered free trade and efficiency.[^143] His social views reflected the hierarchical assumptions common to his era, including attitudes about race, gender, and class that are now recognized as problematic.[^144] While these must be understood in historical context, they complicate the image of Mendeleev as an unqualified progressive or hero.[^145]

The Nobel Prize controversy has generated debate about whether Mendeleev was truly wronged or whether the committee had legitimate concerns. Some defenders of the Nobel Committee argue that by 1906, the periodic table was nearly four decades old and had already been thoroughly recognized through other prizes and honors.[^146] The Nobel Prize statutes prefer recent discoveries, and there is a case that Moissan's isolation of fluorine, achieved in 1886, was more recent.[^147] However, most historians consider the committee's decision indefensible given the fundamental importance of the periodic law compared to the isolation of a single element, however difficult.[^148]

Some feminist historians of science have noted that the periodic table discovery narrative focuses entirely on male scientists, overlooking any contributions women might have made to understanding atomic weights and elemental properties in the 19th century.[^149] While there is no evidence that women scientists were directly involved in the periodic table's development, the gender exclusivity of the story reflects the broader exclusion of women from scientific institutions and recognition during this period.[^150]

Finally, some contemporary chemists and educators question whether the traditional Mendeleev-centered pedagogy best serves modern chemistry education. The emphasis on memorizing the periodic table and Mendeleev's biography, they argue, sometimes comes at the expense of deeper understanding of atomic structure, quantum mechanics, and the physical basis for periodicity.[^151] A few educators have suggested that teaching should focus more on the "why" of the periodic table (electron configurations, quantum numbers) rather than the "who" (Mendeleev's story), though this remains a minority view.[^152]
