## Overview

The September 11 attacks (9/11) were the deadliest terrorist act in world history. Nineteen al-Qaeda terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes. Two were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing both towers to collapse. A third plane hit the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. The fourth plane, United 93, crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers fought back. The attacks killed 2,977 people, triggered the U.S. "War on Terror," led to the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and fundamentally changed global security, travel, and surveillance.
