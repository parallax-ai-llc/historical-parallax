## Summary

Willem de Kooning (April 24, 1904 – March 19, 1997) was a Dutch-born American abstract expressionist artist who became one of the most influential painters of the twentieth century.[^1] Arriving in the United States as a stowaway in 1926, he rose from poverty to become a central figure in the New York School and a pioneer of action painting.[^2] His controversial "Woman" series and dynamic brushwork challenged conventional notions of abstraction and figuration, while his seven-decade career expanded the possibilities of painting itself.[^3] Despite battles with alcoholism, complex personal relationships, and Alzheimer's disease in his final years, de Kooning's work commanded record-breaking prices and continues to influence contemporary artists today.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Willem de Kooning was born on April 24, 1904, in Rotterdam Noord, a working-class district of Rotterdam, the Netherlands.[^5] His parents, Leendert de Kooning and Cornelia Nobel, divorced in 1907 when Willem was only three years old.[^6] Following the divorce, young Willem lived first with his father and then with his mother, experiencing the instability that would mark much of his early life.[^7]

In 1916, at the age of twelve, de Kooning left formal schooling and became an apprentice at Jan and Jaap Gidding's commercial art and decorating firm in Rotterdam.[^8] The firm recognized his artistic talent and encouraged him to enroll in evening classes at the prestigious Rotterdam Academy of Fine Arts and Techniques (Academie van Beeldende Kunsten en Technische Wetenschappen).[^9] For eight years, from 1916 to 1924, de Kooning attended these rigorous evening courses while working during the day, receiving what he later described as a stern academic training in the arts and master craftsman's proficiency in craft techniques.[^10]

From 1920 to 1923, de Kooning worked as an assistant to the art director of a large Rotterdam department store, where his employer, Bernard Romein, introduced him to the groundbreaking work of Dutch modernist Piet Mondrian and the De Stijl movement.[^11] This exposure to avant-garde art would prove formative to his developing aesthetic sensibility. From 1924 to 1926, he lived in Belgium and studied at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels, further expanding his artistic education.[^12]

Seeking greater opportunities and adventure, de Kooning made the bold decision to leave Europe. On July 19, 1926, the twenty-two-year-old artist stowed away in the engine room of the S.S. Shelley, a British freighter bound for Argentina.[^13] A friend, Leo Cohan, who had worked on ships, arranged for de Kooning's passage in exchange for 25 guilders for union dues.[^14] On August 15, 1926, the ship docked at Newport News, Virginia, and the penniless young artist, who spoke no English and carried no legal papers, stepped onto American soil.[^15] He made his way north to New York City with Dutch friends and initially stayed at the Dutch Seamen's Home in Hoboken, New Jersey, finding work as a house painter to support himself.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

De Kooning's rise from impoverished immigrant to celebrated artist was gradual and hard-won. Throughout the late 1920s and 1930s, he struggled financially while developing his artistic voice in New York City.[^17] A pivotal moment came when he met Arshile Gorky, a fellow émigré artist, at the home of Misha Reznikoff in the late 1920s.[^18] Gorky became de Kooning's closest friend and most important early influence; contemporaries observed that "de Kooning virtually worshipped Gorky," and according to artist Aristodimos Kaldis, "Gorky was de Kooning's master."[^19] Gorky's fluid, Surrealist-inspired, figure-based abstractions profoundly shaped de Kooning's work throughout the 1930s and 1940s.[^20]

In October 1935, de Kooning joined the WPA (Works Progress Administration) Federal Art Project, a Depression-era work-relief program that employed artists across America.[^21] This position provided him with his first opportunity to devote himself full-time to creative work, and he later credited the WPA with teaching him to think of himself as an artist first.[^22] He worked in both the easel-painting and mural divisions, though the several murals he designed were never executed.[^23] During this period, he forged lifelong relationships, including with Harold Rosenberg, then a poet who would later become one of Abstract Expressionism's most influential critics.[^24] However, in July 1937, the U.S. government announced that all WPA workers had to be legal citizens, forcing de Kooning, along with Mark Rothko and Arshile Gorky, to resign from the program.[^25] Fearing deportation, de Kooning continued working illegally in the United States for decades.[^26]

In the fall of 1938, de Kooning met Elaine Fried, a twenty-year-old art student introduced to him by her teacher Robert Jonas at a Manhattan cafeteria.[^27] Willem, then thirty-four, began instructing Elaine in drawing and painting, earning a reputation for his harsh criticism of her work.[^28] They married on December 9, 1943, and Elaine moved into his loft, where they shared studio space.[^29] Their marriage was unconventional from the start—both were casual about sex and maintained what would later be called an "open marriage," with Elaine having affairs with men who helped further Willem's career, including critic Harold Rosenberg, ARTnews managing editor Thomas B. Hess, and gallery owner Charles Egan.[^30]

De Kooning's breakthrough came in 1948 with his first solo exhibition at the Charles Egan Gallery in New York, featuring black-and-white enamel compositions that demonstrated his mastery of gestural abstraction.[^31] That same year, MoMA acquired "Painting" (1948), the first de Kooning work to enter any museum collection.[^32] Also in 1948, Josef Albers invited de Kooning to teach painting during the summer session at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, where he brought his groundbreaking painting "Asheville," which marked a turning point in his career toward all-over composition.[^33] He subsequently taught at Yale School of Art from 1950 to 1951, establishing himself as both a practicing artist and influential educator.[^34]

## Major Achievements

De Kooning's artistic achievements fundamentally reshaped twentieth-century art and established him as one of Abstract Expressionism's defining figures. His 1950 painting "Excavation," an oil and enamel work measuring 81 x 100¼ inches, represented a major breakthrough.[^35] Completed just in time for the twenty-fifth Venice Biennale, the painting featured de Kooning's distinctive organization of space into sliding planes with open contours, and hooked calligraphic lines defining anatomical parts—bird and fish shapes, human features—that danced across the surface.[^36] Inspired by an image of women working in a rice field from the 1949 Italian Neorealist film "Bitter Rice," the work exemplified the tension between abstraction and figuration that would characterize his entire career.[^37] The Art Institute of Chicago acquired the painting through the Frank G. Logan Purchase Prize Fund in 1952, cementing de Kooning's institutional recognition.[^38]

The most significant and controversial achievement of de Kooning's career came with his "Woman" series, painted between 1950 and 1953. When all six Woman paintings were exhibited together at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1953, they created a firestorm of criticism and debate.[^39] The Museum of Modern Art's purchase of "Woman I" (1950-1952) in 1953 signaled institutional acceptance of what many considered a radical departure from pure abstraction.[^40] These paintings, with their aggressive brushwork and distorted female figures, shocked feminists who interpreted the colliding brushstrokes as violence toward the female body.[^41] Critic Emily Genauer attacked the works as misogynistic depictions of women being tortured, while second-wave feminist scholar Carol Duncan wrote the scathing article "The MoMA's Hot Mamas," criticizing de Kooning's manipulation of anatomy as an assertion of ownership over the female body.[^42]

Within the Abstract Expressionist movement itself, the Woman series proved equally divisive. Jackson Pollock and other abstract expressionists felt de Kooning had betrayed Abstract Expressionism's goal of pure painting by resorting to recognizably figurative art.[^43] Critics were incensed both by the ugliness of the images and by the inclusion of vestiges of the figure in abstraction.[^44] De Kooning's own comments—"Women irritate me sometimes. I painted that irritation in the 'Woman' series"—did little to alleviate criticism.[^45] However, defenders argued that his real interest was stylistic, and that he was attacking the idealized feminine type promoted by advertisers and Hollywood rather than women themselves.[^46]

Despite—or perhaps because of—the controversy, de Kooning's influence continued to expand. His first major retrospective, "de Kooning: 1935–1953," was held in 1953 at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.[^47] A landmark international retrospective organized by Thomas B. Hess opened at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam in 1968 and traveled to MoMA, the Tate Gallery, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[^48] The most comprehensive retrospective, featuring nearly 200 works spanning his seven-decade career, was mounted by MoMA from September 2011 to January 2012.[^49]

De Kooning's achievements extended beyond painting to influence an entire generation of artists. His dynamic brushwork, complex compositions, and profound exploration of form and space established him as a master of gestural abstraction and action painting.[^50] Art historian Irving Sandler declared that de Kooning "was able to continue the grand tradition of Western painting and to deflect it in a new direction, creating an avant-garde style that spoke to our time."[^51] His influence resonated with neo-expressionists of the 1980s and continues with contemporary painters expanding the boundaries of abstraction, including Cecily Brown and Amy Sillman.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Beyond the feminist critiques of his Woman series, de Kooning faced numerous controversies throughout his career. His illegal immigration status haunted him for decades—he didn't become a U.S. citizen until March 13, 1962, after living in America for thirty-six years.[^53] This alien status cost him his WPA position in 1937 and created ongoing anxiety about deportation.[^54]

His relationship with critic Clement Greenberg became contentious when de Kooning painted "Woman I." Greenberg, who had championed Abstract Expressionism and backed Jackson Pollock as the movement's exemplar, viewed de Kooning's return to figuration as "an act of betrayal, with high culture at stake."[^55] Greenberg withdrew his support, though Harold Rosenberg—who had modeled the term "action painting" on his intimate knowledge of de Kooning's working process—remained convinced of his relevance.[^56] This critical divide reflected broader debates about the nature and direction of Abstract Expressionism.

The rivalry between de Kooning and Jackson Pollock added another layer of controversy. Both artists were central figures in the New York School, living and working in the same circles, which naturally created competitive tensions.[^57] De Kooning's success was "slow-burning"—he was respected in artistic circles but initially lacked Pollock's acclaim and gallery attention.[^58] When de Kooning's 1948 solo show proved moderately successful, Pollock felt jarred by his rival's success.[^59] Their different personalities exacerbated tensions: Pollock was argumentative, provocative, and known to be a bad drunk, while de Kooning was well-liked, respected, and socially adaptable.[^60] Though they may have taken their rivalry half as a joke, especially after a few drinks, real competitive pressures existed beneath the surface.[^61] The rivalry ended with Pollock's death in 1956, after which de Kooning seemed bent on maintaining a connection with his dead friend and rival.[^62]

De Kooning's personal life generated its own controversies. His marriage to Elaine, though never legally dissolved, effectively ended when they separated in 1957, both struggling with alcoholism.[^63] During one separation, Willem had an affair with Joan Ward, an illustrator, resulting in the birth of his only child, Lisa de Kooning, on January 29, 1956.[^64] Elaine's strategic affairs with influential critics and gallery owners raised questions about the ethics of art world relationships and the role of personal connections in artistic success.[^65]

The most significant late-career controversy concerned the authenticity and quality of paintings de Kooning produced after his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1984.[^66] A court declared him unfit to manage his estate, which was turned over to conservators.[^67] Despite his illness, he continued to paint with the help of assistants until 1991, raising questions about authorship, agency, and artistic intention.[^68] Critics remained unable to agree whether these late works showed intellectual decline or artistic evolution, making them subjects of considerable scholarly debate.[^69]

Art historical assessments also proved contentious. MoMA curators tended to regard de Kooning after 1950 as a painter in decline, with the museum's collection considerably stronger in Pollock, Rothko, and Newman than in de Kooning.[^70] Many reviewers believed his "abstract expressionist phase" of the late 1940s and early 1950s was by far his strongest period, viewing the work of the 1960s and later as having "floundered."[^71] This institutional bias affected his reputation and market value during certain periods of his career.

## Personal Life

Willem de Kooning's personal life was characterized by intense relationships, struggles with addiction, and an unconventional approach to domesticity. His marriage to Elaine Fried de Kooning, herself a talented artist, was one of the art world's most complex partnerships.[^72] From the beginning, both maintained extramarital relationships—Elaine's affairs with Harold Rosenberg, Thomas B. Hess, and Charles Egan were conducted openly within their social circle.[^73] Willem's relationship with Joan Ward resulted in the birth of his daughter Lisa in 1956, creating a parallel family structure while he remained legally married to Elaine.[^74]

Both Willem and Elaine battled alcoholism, which contributed significantly to their separation in 1957.[^75] They remained separated for nearly twenty years, though they never divorced.[^76] In a remarkable reconciliation, they reunited in 1976, with Elaine buying a house near Willem's in the Springs, East Hampton, and taking over management of his studio.[^77] After Elaine's death in 1989, Willem's daughter Lisa cared for him until his own death in 1997.[^78]

De Kooning was a fixture in the social life of New York's Abstract Expressionist community. He was a founding member of the Eighth Street Artists' Club (known simply as "The Club"), which opened in October 1949 at 39 East 8th Street, where artists met weekly to discuss art and ideas.[^79] He was also a hard-drinking regular at the Cedar Tavern at 24 University Place in Greenwich Village, patronizing the bar throughout the 1950s alongside Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, and others.[^80] Historians consider the Cedar Tavern an important incubator of the Abstract Expressionist movement.[^81]

In 1961, de Kooning purchased a small country house from his brother-in-law, Peter Fried, in The Springs, East Hampton, on Long Island.[^82] In 1963, he designed and built a soaring, butterfly-roofed, light-filled studio and home in a quiet, wooded neighborhood, dividing his time between Long Island and Manhattan before permanently relocating to Springs in 1971.[^83] The move profoundly impacted his work—the North Atlantic light and flat beaches reminded him of Holland and opened up his canvases to include softer colors and more loosely painted forms.[^84]

Lisa de Kooning, Willem's only child, became a sculptor and dedicated much of her life to preserving her father's legacy, establishing both the Willem de Kooning Trust and Foundation and overseeing management of his entire estate.[^85] She died at age fifty-six on November 23, 2012, at her home in St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands.[^86]

## Legacy

Willem de Kooning died on March 19, 1997, at his Springs studio at 5:30 in the morning from complications of Alzheimer's disease, at the age of ninety-two.[^87] He was cremated, ending a life that had spanned nearly a century and transformed the course of American art.[^88]

De Kooning's legacy as one of the twentieth century's most influential artists remains secure. During his seven-decade career, he expanded the language of painting with a mastery that had few equals.[^89] He led the 1950s art world into American Abstract Expressionism, and his influence extended across multiple generations.[^90] His bold exploration of form, gesture, and material resonated with neo-expressionists of the 1980s and continues to inspire contemporary painters expanding the boundaries of abstraction.[^91]

His impact on painting technique and philosophy proved particularly enduring. His violent brushstrokes and gestural abstraction exemplified action painting while his refusal to abandon representation distinguished him within the Abstract Expressionist movement.[^92] Delicate, sweeping strokes juxtaposed with violent, slashing gestures reflected the artist's internal struggle and established a vocabulary for expressing raw emotion through paint.[^93] Harold Rosenberg's definition of Action Painting—the painting as event, an encounter between artist and materials rather than a finished work in the traditional sense—was modeled directly on de Kooning's practice.[^94]

The market has consistently validated de Kooning's significance. In September 2015, his painting "Interchange" (1955) sold for approximately $300 million in a private sale from the David Geffen Foundation to hedge-fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin, setting a record for the highest price paid for a painting at that time.[^95] Remarkably, de Kooning had originally sold the painting at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1955 for $4,000.[^96] In 2006, "Woman III" sold for $137.5 million in a private sale from David Geffen to Steven A. Cohen.[^97] These sales underscore the enduring demand for his work and his position at the pinnacle of twentieth-century art.

The Willem de Kooning Foundation, established by his daughter Lisa, continues to preserve and promote his legacy, maintaining comprehensive documentation of his work and supporting scholarship.[^98] Major museums worldwide hold significant de Kooning collections, ensuring that future generations can study and appreciate his contributions to art history.[^99]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly admirers have consistently recognized de Kooning as a transformative figure who bridged tradition and innovation. Art historian Irving Sandler articulated what many scholars believe: that de Kooning "was able to continue the grand tradition of Western painting and to deflect it in a new direction, creating an avant-garde style that spoke to our time."[^100] This assessment emphasizes de Kooning's unique achievement in maintaining continuity with art historical precedents while pioneering radically new approaches.

Harold Rosenberg, one of Abstract Expressionism's most influential critics, championed de Kooning throughout his career, modeling the foundational concept of "action painting" on his intimate knowledge of de Kooning's working process.[^101] Rosenberg's famous 1952 essay effectively likened de Kooning to a heroic existentialist wrestling with self-expression through the physical act of painting.[^102] This philosophical framework elevated de Kooning's practice beyond mere technique to a profound engagement with human consciousness and existence.

The Museum of Modern Art's acceptance of the Woman series, including the 1953 purchase of "Woman I," demonstrated institutional recognition that what seemed stylistically reactionary to some was clearly avant-garde to others.[^103] Most reviewers in England recognized de Kooning's status as one of the great American painters, alongside the deceased Jackson Pollock, and even as an old master comparable to Titian or Rubens.[^104]

Contemporary scholars have developed more nuanced appreciations of his work. Feminist scholars, moving beyond simplistic charges of misogyny, now offer complex readings of the Woman series that examine questions of gender representation in the post-war era.[^105] Art historian examinations reveal how de Kooning's depictions challenge idealized feminine types promoted by advertisers and Hollywood, suggesting a critique of consumer culture rather than an attack on women themselves.[^106]

President Lyndon Johnson's presentation of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to de Kooning on September 14, 1964, included the citation that he "has adventured into a new range of artistic vision and opened bold pathways to our experience of the world," acknowledging his contribution not just to art but to American culture broadly.[^107] Additional honors including the Guggenheim International Award (1964), Albert Einstein Commemorative Award (1973), Andrew W. Mellon Prize (1979), Max Beckmann Prize (1984), and National Medal of Arts (1986) demonstrated sustained recognition of his achievements.[^108]

### Negative Views

Despite widespread acclaim, significant critical voices have challenged de Kooning's reputation and questioned aspects of his legacy. Clement Greenberg, perhaps Abstract Expressionism's most influential critic, withdrew support after de Kooning's Woman series, viewing the return to figuration as a betrayal of high modernist principles.[^109] Greenberg's formalist approach privileged pure abstraction, and he backed Jackson Pollock over de Kooning, creating an influential critical narrative that devalued de Kooning's figurative work.[^110]

Feminist critics mounted sustained attacks on the Woman series. Emily Genauer called the works misogynistic depictions of women being tortured.[^111] Carol Duncan's scathing article "The MoMA's Hot Mamas" criticized de Kooning's manipulation of anatomy as an assertion of ownership over the female body, arguing that the paintings reflected disturbing attitudes toward women endemic in mid-century American culture.[^112] These critiques raise persistent questions about whether artistic innovation can justify imagery that many viewers experience as violent and degrading.

Within the Abstract Expressionist movement itself, Jackson Pollock and others felt de Kooning had failed to sustain Abstract Expressionism's goal of pure painting by resorting to recognizably figurative art.[^113] Critics at the 1953 Sidney Janis Gallery exhibition were incensed by the ugliness of the images and by what they saw as de Kooning's lack of commitment to the Abstract Expressionist project.[^114] This internal critique suggested that de Kooning's approach was neither fully abstract nor fully figurative, occupying an uncomfortable middle ground that satisfied no one.

MoMA curators tended to regard de Kooning after 1950 as a painter in decline, with the museum's collection considerably stronger in Pollock, Rothko, and Newman than in de Kooning.[^115] This institutional assessment reflected a broader critical consensus that his abstract expressionist phase of the late 1940s and early 1950s represented his peak, while later work foundered.[^116] The lush exuberance of his 1960s and 1970s works and the elegance of 1980s paintings did not receive the same critical acclaim as his earlier achievements.[^117]

The controversy surrounding paintings produced after his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1984 raised profound ethical questions. With a court declaring him unfit to manage his estate and conservators overseeing his affairs, critics questioned whether works produced with assistants' help could be considered authentic de Koonings.[^118] The inability of critics to agree whether these late works showed intellectual decline or artistic evolution suggested that cognitive impairment had compromised the artistic integrity that previously characterized his work.[^119]

Some scholars argue that de Kooning's ever-changing art—especially his depictions of women—was increasingly slighted during his lifetime because it did not fit easily with the familiar modernist narrative of increasingly refined abstraction.[^120] This critical marginalization affected both his reputation and market value during certain periods, despite his eventual commercial success.[^121]
