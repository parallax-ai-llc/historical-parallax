## Summary

Berke Khan (c. 1209–1266) was a grandson of Genghis Khan who ruled the Golden Horde from 1257 to 1266. He holds the distinction of being the first Mongol ruler to officially embrace Islam, converting in 1252 in the city of Bukhara.[^1][^2] His reign marked a watershed moment in Mongol history, as he initiated the first major civil war between Mongol factions by opposing his cousin Hulagu Khan's destruction of Baghdad and Muslim territories.[^3] Through his alliance with the Mamluk Sultanate and his decisive military victory at the Battle of the Terek River in 1262, Berke effectively halted further Mongol expansion into the Islamic world and prevented the destruction of Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem.[^4][^5]

---

## Early Life and Background

Berke Khan was born around 1209 to Jochi, the eldest son of Genghis Khan, though some sources suggest dates ranging from 1207 to 1221.[^6][^7] His mother was likely Khan-Sultan (also known as Sultan Khatun), the captured daughter of Muhammad II of Khwarazm, whose religious characteristics are believed to have influenced both Berke and his brother Batu.[^8] Berke had several brothers, including Orda, Batu, Sinkur, and Shiban, with whom he would later participate in military campaigns across Eurasia.[^9]

Berke traditionally grew up in a family that practiced idol-worship (wathaniyyah), following the shamanistic traditions of the Mongol people.[^10] However, all three sons of Jochi were trained under the direct supervision of Genghis Khan himself, and they fought under the Shamanic Mongol banner, conquering vast areas for inclusion into the Mongol Empire during their grandfather's lifetime.[^11] This education in both military strategy and imperial administration would prove crucial to Berke's later success as a ruler.

In 1229, Berke was present with several of his brothers at the inauguration of his uncle Ögedei as Great Khan, indicating his active participation in Mongol political affairs from a young age.[^12] This early exposure to the highest levels of Mongol governance provided him with invaluable insights into the workings of the empire and established his position within the Jochid lineage as a significant political figure.

In 1236, Berke joined his brothers in a vast army under Batu Khan's leadership, comprising some 150,000 soldiers who would embark on the conquest of Eastern Europe.[^13] During this invasion, Berke served under his brother Batu and distinguished himself at the Battle of the Mohi, where the Hungarian army was decimated in one of the most significant Mongol victories in Europe.[^14]

---

## Rise to Power

Berke's path to leadership began in earnest in 1248 when Batu sent him, along with his brother Tukh-timur, to Mongolia to support the installation of Möngke Khan on the throne of Great Khan.[^15] In 1251, Berke conducted the kurultai (Mongol assembly) and successfully had Möngke enthroned, demonstrating his diplomatic skills and political influence within the broader Mongol Empire.[^16] This critical role in the succession crisis established Berke as a key power broker among the Mongol nobility.

The turning point in Berke's spiritual and political life came in 1252 when he converted to Islam in the city of Bukhara.[^17] According to historical accounts, when he was at Saray-Jük, Berke met a caravan from Bukhara and questioned them about their faith. Impressed with their explanations of Islam, he decided to convert.[^18] The conversion was facilitated by Saif ud-Din Dervish, a dervish from Khorazm who had a profound influence on the Mongol prince.[^19]

Berke's conversion to Islam was not merely a personal spiritual decision but represented a watershed moment in the history of the Mongol Empire, marking the onset of Islamization among the high-ranking elites of the Golden Horde.[^20] By the time of Berke, the khan presented the shift to Islam as a collective endeavor, with members of the Jochid elite openly displaying their Muslim identity at court, and the ruler's next-of-kin converting as well as the beks (nobles) who surrounded him.[^21]

In 1257, Berke assumed leadership of the Golden Horde after the death of Ulaghchi (some sources suggest he succeeded after Batu's death).[^22] As the first Mongol ruler to officially embrace Islam, Berke succeeded to the khanate with a unique religious mandate that would define his reign and set him apart from other Mongol leaders.[^23] He quickly established himself as an able ruler who succeeded in maintaining and stabilizing the Golden Horde, the western khanate of the Mongol Empire.[^24]

---

## Major Achievements

### Military Victories and Territorial Control

During Berke's government, the Mongols finally defeated the rebellion of Daniel of Galicia, consolidating Mongol control over this strategically important region.[^25] In 1259, he ordered a second major attack against Poland and Lithuania, led by the formidable general Burundai, further expanding the Golden Horde's sphere of influence in Eastern Europe.[^26] These campaigns demonstrated Berke's ability to project military power across vast distances and maintain the martial traditions of his Mongol ancestors.

### The Berke-Hulagu War and the Battle of the Terek River

The most significant military achievement of Berke's reign was his successful prosecution of the war against his cousin Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate.[^27] Following Hulagu's sack of Baghdad in 1258, which resulted in the death of Caliph Al-Musta'sim, Berke became enraged at the destruction of Muslim lands and the murder of the religious leader of the Islamic world.[^28] As a preparatory step, Berke directed his nephew Nogai Khan to raid Poland in 1259 to collect booty to finance the war, and several Polish cities were plundered, including Kraków and Sandomierz.[^29]

In 1262, full-scale war erupted between the two Mongol factions. Berke dispatched Nogai Khan with a substantial force to invade through the Caucasus passes, and Nogai's army swiftly captured the fortress of Derbent.[^30] When Hulagu marched north through the Derbend pass seeking to confront Berke's forces, the Golden Horde, under Nogai Khan's command, ambushed Hulagu's forces at the Terek River.[^31] The Ilkhanate army suffered a devastating defeat, with many soldiers perishing as the frozen Terek River gave way beneath them while they attempted to flee.[^32] This victory solidified Berke's dominance in the region and forced Hulagu to retreat to Azerbaijan, effectively ending the Ilkhanate's northern expansion.

The Berke-Hulagu war was historically significant as the first open conflict between Mongols, signaling the end of the unified Mongol Empire.[^33] This concurrent civil war, which overlapped with the Toluid Civil War between Kublai Khan and Ariq Böke, permanently fragmented Mongol unity and marked a key moment in the division of the empire into separate khanates.[^34]

### Diplomatic Alliance with the Mamluks

Berke struck an alliance with the Mamluk Sultan Qutuz and later Sultan Baibars of Egypt, marking the first time a Mongol prince formed an alliance with an external power against fellow Mongols.[^35] The sultan opened channels of negotiation with the Golden Horde in 1261, and when Berke received Baibars' letter, he immediately realized the importance of this alliance.[^36] This diplomatic achievement was groundbreaking in medieval geopolitics.

Baibars flattered Berke's religious affiliation by including his name in the Friday prayers at Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, and by establishing equitable relations he retained access to the steppe-land slave markets within the Golden Horde and secured the Mamluk sultanate's northern borders with Asia Minor.[^37] After Berke Khan's accession, Al-Zahir Baibars treated him according to Muslim codes of conduct with true support and friendliness to the extent of naming his eldest son Berke, demonstrating the depth of their alliance.[^38]

When Hulagu massed his armies to attack the Mamluks following their victory at Ain Jalut, Berke Khan initiated a series of raids in force which drew Hulagu north to meet him, preventing the Ilkhanate from launching its planned assault on Egypt.[^39] This strategic coordination with the Mamluks effectively saved the Islamic holy cities from potential Mongol destruction.

### Administrative and Religious Reforms

Berke centralized administration by conducting a comprehensive census in 1257 across Russian principalities to standardize tribute collection, shifting from prior reliance on Muslim merchants auctioning collection rights to a direct land tax system.[^40] This reform improved the efficiency of tax collection and reduced corruption within the administrative apparatus of the Golden Horde.

After Berke ascended the throne, he worked hard to spread Islam among the Mongols and Kipchaks, building religious schools (madrasas) and mosques throughout his colony.[^41] He cordially attended to visiting scholars and fuqaha' (Islamic jurists), demonstrating his personal engagement with Islamic learning and religious leadership.[^42] Berke established mosques, religious schools, and appointed Muslim tax collectors while enforcing prohibitions on alcohol and pork consumption in accordance with Islamic law.[^43]

His conversion resulted in the Blue Horde becoming predominantly Muslim, although there were still animists and Buddhists among them.[^44] Berke preceded Ghazan Khan in replacing Yasaq (Mongol traditional law) with Islamic Sharia as the state official regulation, making him a pioneer in the Islamization of Mongol governance.[^45]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Participation in European Massacres

Before his conversion to Islam, Berke participated in the Mongol invasion of Europe, which resulted in widespread destruction and loss of life.[^46] At the Battle of the Mohi in 1241, where he served under his brother Batu, the Hungarian army was decimated in a battle that led to the deaths of tens of thousands and opened Hungary to Mongol ravaging.[^47] The Mongol campaigns in Eastern Europe were characterized by brutal sieges, massacres of civilian populations, and the destruction of entire cities.

### Raids on Poland

In 1259, Berke directed his nephew Nogai Khan to raid Poland to collect booty to finance his war against Hulagu.[^48] Several Polish cities were plundered, including Kraków and Sandomierz, resulting in significant civilian casualties and economic devastation.[^49] While these raids served a strategic purpose in Berke's conflict with the Ilkhanate, they caused immense suffering to populations that had no direct involvement in the inter-Mongol conflict.

### Religious Intolerance

During his reign, the Christian community in Samarkand was punished for its negative attitude, suggesting religious intolerance in some contexts despite Islam's traditional protection of "People of the Book."[^50] This incident reveals that Berke's promotion of Islam sometimes came at the expense of religious minorities within his domains.

### Political Opposition and Division

In the new official version of family history promulgated by Kublai Khan, the Great Khan refused to write Berke's name as khan of the Golden Horde due to his support for Ariq Böke in the Toluid Civil War and his wars with Hulagu.[^51] This political opposition from the nominal head of the Mongol Empire highlighted the deep divisions that Berke's actions had created within the broader Mongol imperial family.

### Fragmentation of the Mongol Empire

While often portrayed as defending Islam, Berke's war against Hulagu was also a major factor in the permanent fragmentation of the Mongol Empire.[^52] His conflict with Hulagu, combined with his support for Ariq Böke against Kublai Khan, accelerated the breakup of the unified empire that his grandfather Genghis Khan had created. Some historians argue that personal ambition and territorial disputes played as significant a role as religious motivation in Berke's conflicts.

---

## Personal Life

Berke was born to Jochi, the eldest son of Genghis Khan, and most likely to Khan-Sultan (Sultan Khatun), the daughter of the Khwarazmian ruler.[^53] The religious characteristics exhibited by his mother are believed to have influenced both Berke and his brother Batu, potentially predisposing them to be more receptive to monotheistic faiths.[^54]

Unfortunately, historical sources contain very limited information about Berke Khan's wives and children. The sources primarily focus on his political and military career, his conversion to Islam, and his conflicts with Hulagu Khan.[^55] None of the available historical records provide specific details about the names of his wives, the number of wives he had, the names or number of his children, or any details about his descendants. This lack of documentation is notable and suggests that these aspects of his personal life were either not well documented by contemporary chroniclers or have been lost to history.

Berke became a devout Muslim following his conversion in 1252.[^56] Contemporary accounts describe him as personally committed to Islamic practice and learning, regularly meeting with scholars and religious leaders who visited his court.[^57] His religious devotion was not merely performative but reflected a genuine spiritual transformation that shaped his political decisions and personal conduct.

Historical accounts suggest that Berke, while hesitant about fighting his cousin Hulagu, ultimately felt compelled by his religious convictions. He reportedly stated: "Mongols are killed by Mongol swords. If we were united, then we would have conquered all of the world."[^58] This quote reveals the internal conflict Berke experienced between his loyalty to Mongol unity and his commitment to defending the Islamic world.

Berke died in 1266 (some sources say early 1267) while on military campaign. As soon as Hulegu died on February 8, 1265, Berke marched to cross the Terek near Tiflis (modern-day Tbilisi, Georgia), but he fell ill and died on the way.[^59] According to the Ilkhanid vizier Rashīd ad-Dīn Faḍlullāh, when Berke died in 1266, he was buried at the "Sarai of Batu," the capital city of the Golden Horde.[^60] He was succeeded by his grandnephew, Mengu-Timur, who continued Berke's policy of alliance with the Mamluks and containment of the Ilkhanate.[^61]

## Legacy

### Religious Transformation of the Golden Horde

Berke Khan's most enduring legacy was the transformation of the Golden Horde into a Muslim state. As the first Mongol king to embrace Islam, he set a precedent that eventually led to three of the four Mongol Khanates converting to Islam.[^62] His successors Töde-Möngke and Özbeg also converted to Islam, ensuring that the religion was connected with the very foundation of the Golden Horde.[^63] The conversion of Khans Berke and Özbeg had a major impact on the Dār al-Islām (the Islamic world) and beyond, fundamentally altering the religious landscape of Central Asia and Eastern Europe.[^64]

### Saving Islamic Holy Cities

Berke Khan's intervention saved Islamic holy cities, including Mecca, Medina, and Jerusalem, from the forces of Hulagu.[^65] His military actions prevented further Mongol destruction of the Muslim world after the devastating Fall of Baghdad in 1258. While most historians are quick to view the Battle of Ain Jalut as the decisive event that checked Mongol onslaught, it was only through Berke Khan's efforts that massacres of Muslims came to a halt.[^66] By forcing Hulagu to divert his forces northward to defend against Golden Horde attacks, Berke effectively prevented the Ilkhanate from launching a sustained campaign against the Mamluk Sultanate.

### Infrastructure and Cultural Development

Berke had presumably continued the development of Sarai, the capital city established by Batu, promoting the settlement of Muslims and attracting Muslim literati, leading later Muslim accounts to credit him with the foundation of the city.[^67] The city gained significance as a large cultural center whose population may have reached 100,000 people under later khans.[^68] The city's architecture was a unique blend of Mongol, Persian, and Islamic styles, reflecting the diverse cultural influences of the region.[^69]

His educational policies helped establish a foundation for Islamic learning in the Mongol territories that would influence the region for centuries.[^70] The mosques and madrasas he built throughout his territory became centers of learning that trained generations of scholars, jurists, and religious leaders.

### Geopolitical Impact

The Berke-Hulagu war and the Toluid Civil War marked a key moment in the fragmentation of the Mongol Empire after the death of Möngke, the fourth khan of the Mongol Empire.[^71] By the late 13th century, the Mongol Empire had fractured into four khanates: the Golden Horde, the Chagatai Khanate, the Ilkhanate, and the Yuan dynasty.[^72] While this fragmentation is sometimes viewed negatively, it also allowed for greater regional autonomy and the development of distinct cultural identities within each khanate.

The alliance system Berke established with the Mamluks created a lasting diplomatic framework. The policy of alliance with the Mamluks, and containment of the Ilkhanate, was continued by Mengu-Timur after Berke's death in 1266-67.[^73] This alliance provided mutual benefits: the Mamluks gained a powerful ally that threatened the Ilkhanate from the north, while the Golden Horde maintained access to slave markets and trade routes through Mamluk territories.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly work praises Berke Khan as a pivotal figure who altered the course of Mongol and Islamic history. Numerous independent sources from the 13th and 14th centuries attest to Berke's conversion and his role in establishing Islam in the Golden Horde.[^74] Modern historians describe him as "the savior of Muslim civilization" and emphasize his role in preventing the complete destruction of the Islamic world by Mongol forces.[^75]

Islamic historians particularly celebrate Berke for his defense of Baghdad and his protest against Hulagu's atrocities. Muslim historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani quoted Berke Khan as telling his Mongols and Muslim subjects: "He (Hulagu) has sacked all the cities of the Muslims, and has brought about the death of the Caliph. With the help of Allah, I will call him to account for so much innocent blood."[^76] This statement is seen as evidence of Berke's genuine commitment to Islamic principles and his willingness to prioritize religious solidarity over family loyalty.

Contemporary Muslim accounts describe Berke as not merely politically opportunistic in his conversion but as expressing a new social identity and source of collective solidarity that was connected with the foundation of a new horde.[^77] Scholars note that Berke preceded Ghazan Khan in replacing Yasaq with Islamic Sharia as the state official regulation, making him a pioneer in Islamic governance among Mongol rulers.[^78]

Berke is recognized as an able administrator who successfully maintained and stabilized the Golden Horde during a period of significant political turbulence.[^79] His administrative reforms, including the census of 1257 and the standardization of tax collection, demonstrated his capacity for effective governance.[^80] His diplomatic skills in forging the alliance with the Mamluks are particularly praised as an example of strategic thinking that transcended traditional Mongol political patterns.

### Negative Views

Some historians question the purely religious motivations attributed to Berke's conflict with Hulagu, suggesting that territorial ambitions and personal rivalry played significant roles. When Hulagu seized regions for himself after Möngke's death, incorporating them into a new ulus ruled by him, Berke was reportedly aghast that this Toluid upstart was taking lands he considered rightfully belonging to the Jochid line, solely without the Khan's authority.[^81]

The economic grievances between the two khanates were substantial. The Ilkhanids had hoarded the wealth of North Iran and demanded the Golden Horde cease selling slaves to the Mamluks; the economic damage to the Golden Horde from the actions of the Ilkhanate led Berke to declare jihad.[^82] Critics argue that these economic and territorial disputes were the primary drivers of the conflict, with religion serving as a convenient justification.

Scholarly work faces challenges due to the lack of good critical editions of Arabic, Persian, and Turkic texts, which are necessary prerequisites for writing detailed monographs on different aspects of the Golden Horde.[^83] This limited source material means that much of what is "known" about Berke relies on accounts that followed conventional topoi of conversion narratives in Islamic historiography, potentially exaggerating the religious dimensions of his actions.[^84]

Some historians point out that Berke was "probably not an exemplar of sainthood," noting instances of religious intolerance and brutal military campaigns that contradict the image of a purely pious ruler.[^85] His punishment of the Christian community in Samarkand and his devastating raids on Poland suggest a more complex and sometimes contradictory character than hagiographic accounts present.

The fragmentation of the Mongol Empire, to which Berke significantly contributed, is viewed by some scholars as a tragic loss of the potential for a unified Eurasian political order. His support for Ariq Böke against Kublai Khan and his war against Hulagu accelerated the dissolution of the empire his grandfather had built, leading to centuries of conflict between the successor khanates.
