## Summary

The 1976 Tehran UFO incident is widely considered one of the most credible military UFO cases in history. On the night of September 19, 1976, the Imperial Iranian Air Force received reports of a bright object over Tehran. Two **F-4 Phantom II** jet interceptors were scrambled to investigate.

Crucially, this case involves multiple forms of confirmation: visual sightings by civilians and military personnel, radar locks by ground control and aircraft, and—most famously—**catastrophic equipment failure** when the jets attempted to engage the object. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) produced a detailed report on the event, noting the high credibility of the witnesses (elite pilots).[^1]

## The Encounter

### The Scramble
At around 12:30 AM, the command post at Mehrabad Air Force Base began receiving calls about a bright light in the sky.
*   **First F-4:** The first jet took off but immediately experienced radio failure and lost instrumentation as it approached the object. The pilot aborted and returned to base.
*   **Second F-4 (Mayeri/Jafari):** A second jet, piloted by Major **Parviz Jafari**, was scrambled. He acquired a radar lock on the object at a range of 25 nautical miles. The radar return was massive, comparable to a Boeing 707 tanker.

### The Dogfight
Jafari described the object as flashing with intense red, green, orange, and blue lights so bright he couldn't see the body of the craft.
*   **The Attack:** As Jafari closed in, a smaller object detached from the main mothership and accelerated toward him. Thinking he was under attack, Jafari attempted to fire an **AIM-9 Sidewinder** missile.
*   **System Failure:** At the exact moment he tried to launch, his weapons control panel and all communications systems shut down. He was defenseless.
*   **Evasive Action:** Jafari dove the plane to escape. The smaller object followed him briefly, then rejoined the main craft. As soon as Jafari moved away, his systems came back online.[^2]

### The Landing
The crew watched the object descend and apparently land or hover near the ground. A bright light illuminated the desert floor. A search the next day found no wreckage, but the signal from an emergency beeper (C-141) was detected in the area, leading to further confusion.[^3]

## The DIA Report

The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) classified the report as highly significant. The evaluation section stated:
> "An outstanding report. This case is a classic which meets all the criteria necessary for a valid study of the UFO phenomenon."

The report cited:
1.  **Multiple Witnesses:** Highly trained military personnel.
2.  **Radar Confirmation:** Validated by airborne and ground radar.
3.  **Electromagnetic Inteference (EMI):** The shutdown of separate systems on two different aircraft is difficult to explain conventionally.[^4]

## Explanations

### Jupiter Theory
Skeptics (like Philip J. Klass) argued that the pilots were simply chasing the planet **Jupiter**, and the equipment failures were coincidental maintenance issues.
*   **Problems with Theory:** Jupiter does not appear on radar as a Boeing 707, does not detach smaller objects that chase jets, and does not cause localized EMP effects.[^5]
