## Summary

Moses de León was a Spanish Jewish rabbi and mystic who is widely believed to be the primary author of the Zohar, the central text of Kabbalah. He attributed the work to the 2nd-century sage Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. The Zohar became the most important mystical text in Judaism, profoundly influencing Jewish theology, liturgy, and practice. Scholarly consensus attributes most of the Zohar to Moses de León, though the question remains debated.
