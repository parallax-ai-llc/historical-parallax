## Summary

The Lonnie Zamora incident is one of the most credible "close encounter of the third kind" cases in history because the primary witness was an active-duty police officer, and the event left verifiable physical evidence. On April 24, 1964, Socorro Police Sergeant **Lonnie Zamora** broke off a car chase to investigate a loud roar and a flame. He found an egg-shaped craft landed in a gully (arroyo) and saw two small humanoid figures standing beside it.

When Zamora got out of his car, the craft roared to life and took off. Investigators from the FBI, the Army, and Project Blue Book found burn marks and deep landing gear indentations in the soil. Even the skeptical **J. Allen Hynek** (Blue Book's chief scientist) was impressed, calling it one of the most puzzling cases he ever investigated.[^1]

## The Incident

### The Chase (5:45 PM)
Sgt. Lonnie Zamora was chasing a speeding black Chevrolet when he heard a roar "like a dynamite blast" and saw a bluish-orange flame in the sky to the southwest. Fearing a dynamite shack had exploded, he abandoned the speeder and drove up a rough mesa road.

### The Sighting
From the top of the mesa, he looked down into a gully and saw:
*   **The Object:** A shiny, whitish-aluminum object shaped like an oval or an egg on its side. It was resting on girder-like legs.
*   **The Occupants:** He saw two small people in white coveralls near the object. He assumed it was a car accident and they were inspecting the damage.
*   **The Close Encounter:** As he drove closer (within 100 feet), the figures vanished. A loud roar began (rising in pitch), and a blue flame shot out from under the craft.
*   **The Retreat:** Fearing an explosion, Zamora dove behind his cruiser for cover. The object rose straight up, leveled off, and flew away silently at high speed.[^2]

### The Symbol
Zamora saw a red insignia on the side of the craft.
*   **Description:** He sketched it as an arrow pointing up, with a semi-circle over the top and a horizontal line at the bottom.
*   **Controversy:** Later, some sources claimed the "real" symbol was different (an inverted V with lines) and the public version was a ruse to weed out copycat hoaxes.[^3]

## The Investigation

### Physical Evidence
Within hours, Sgt. Chavez (another officer) and military police arrived.
*   **Landing Marks:** They found four wedge-shaped depressions in the ground where the legs had been. The soil was pushed down inches deep.
*   **Burned Brush:** The greasewood and mesquite bushes in the center were burned and still smoking.
*   **Fused Sand:** The sand in the center had been fused into glass-like material by intense heat.

### Project Blue Book
Dr. J. Allen Hynek arrived to investigate. He tried to debunk it as a student prank or a helicopter but failed.
*   **Conclusion:** The Air Force admitted they could not explain the object. It remains the only "landing" case listed as "Unidentified" in the final Blue Book report that involved such strong physical traces.[^4]

## Legacy

The Socorro incident was pivotal. It helped convince J. Allen Hynek that UFOs were a real scientific anomaly, leading him to eventually break with the Air Force and form his own research organization (CUFOS). The town of Socorro recently dedicated a mural to the event.
