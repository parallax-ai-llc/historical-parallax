## Summary

Karl Barth was a Swiss Reformed theologian widely regarded as the most important Protestant theologian of the 20th century. His commentary on Romans launched the Neo-Orthodox movement, rejecting liberal theology. His massive Church Dogmatics, left unfinished, is one of the most ambitious theological works ever attempted. He was a leader of the Confessing Church's opposition to Nazism and drafted the Barmen Declaration.
