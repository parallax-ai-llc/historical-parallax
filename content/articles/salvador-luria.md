## Summary

Salvador Luria was an Italian-American microbiologist who shared the 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries about viral replication and genetics. The Luria-Delbrück experiment he conducted with Max Delbrück proved that genetic mutations in bacteria occur randomly rather than as adaptive responses. He was also an influential mentor and social activist who opposed the Vietnam War.
