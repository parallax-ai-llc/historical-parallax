## Summary

Lert Sreshthaputra (เลิศ เศรษฐบุตร), known as Nai Lert (นายเลิศ), was Thailand's pioneering business magnate and urban developer who fundamentally transformed Bangkok's commercial and transportation infrastructure in the early 20th century.[^1] Born into a prominent Thai-Chinese family in 1872, he introduced numerous innovations to Siam including the nation's first ice factory, bus service, taxi company, and commercial skyscraper.[^2] King Rama VI bestowed upon him the royal title Phraya Bhakdi Noraset, meaning "Beloved Millionaire," in recognition of his contributions to Thai commerce and society.[^3] His legacy continues through the Nai Lert Group and the historic Nai Lert Park Heritage Home, one of Bangkok's first Western-style parks.

## Early Life and Background

Nai Lert was born on June 22, 1872, at his family's home near the foot of Wat Bophitphimook Bridge at the mouth of Klong Ong Ang in Bangkok.[^4] He came from a distinguished Thai-Chinese family of considerable influence in Siamese commerce and society. His father, Chuen Sreshthaputra, was one of the sons of Luang Prasertwanit and a nephew of Phra Prasertwanit, who founded the Sreshthaputra family.[^5] The Sreshthaputra family traced descent from Phra Prasoetwanit (Po), a Chinese tax farmer during the reign of King Rama I, and had established themselves as prominent merchants and philanthropists in Bangkok.[^6]

During his formative years, Nai Lert received an education at Suan Ananta School, where he studied the English language—a relatively rare opportunity in late 19th-century Siam that would prove invaluable for his future business endeavors.[^7] This early exposure to Western languages and ideas set him apart from many of his contemporaries and equipped him with the tools to build bridges between Thailand and the wider world. His bilingual education allowed him to navigate both traditional Siamese society and the emerging international business community with equal facility.

After completing his education, Nai Lert began his career working for various firms in Bangkok's commercial sector. His talent and business acumen quickly became apparent, and by the remarkably young age of 20, he had become a partner at the Singapore Strait Company, which would later evolve into Fraser and Neave, one of Southeast Asia's most prominent beverage companies.[^8] This early success demonstrated not only his commercial instincts but also his ability to work across cultural and national boundaries at a time when such international business relationships were still relatively uncommon in Siam.

---

## Rise to Power

Nai Lert's ascent in the business world accelerated when he established his own enterprise at age 22. In 1894, he founded Nai Lert Store, an imported goods business that would become the foundation of his commercial empire.[^9] The store's most revolutionary offering was the introduction of Thailand's first domestically produced ice—a sensation in an era when most Thais had never seen frozen water.[^10] He established the country's first ice factory on Charoen Krung Road, transforming what had been a luxury import into an accessible commodity for Bangkok's residents.[^11]

Building on this success, Nai Lert expanded his business interests into transportation, recognizing the critical need for modern mobility solutions in Bangkok's rapidly growing urban landscape. In 1907, he launched Thailand's first bus service, named "Rot Mail Nai Lert" (Mr. Lert's Bus), to serve Bangkok commuters.[^12] The initial route ran between Pratunam and Yotse Bridge near Wat Thepsirin on Klong Padung Krung Kasem.[^13] This innovative venture, known as the White Bus Company, revolutionized urban transport in the city and demonstrated Nai Lert's visionary understanding of Bangkok's development needs.

Not content with buses alone, Nai Lert also pioneered Thailand's first taxi service using imported European and American automobiles.[^14] He was among the first to import European cars into Thailand, including the stylish Fiat 508 Balilla, which he personally drove around Bangkok—sometimes accompanied by his pet leopard, Tam.[^15] In 1910, he replaced traditional horse carriages with motorized vehicles, using three-wheeled Ford cars with parallel bench seating.[^16] Additionally, he operated the White Boat Company, which provided pleasure boats, seagoing vessels, and public transportation services along the Klong Saen Saep canal from Pratunam, creating an integrated multimodal transportation network.[^17]

## Major Achievements

### Real Estate Development and Urban Planning

Nai Lert's most enduring contribution to Bangkok's urban landscape came through his pioneering real estate developments. In 1915, he acquired a vast tract of land in the Phloen Chit area, which was then a rural, swampy region far from the city center.[^18] With remarkable foresight, he master-planned the area and subdivided it into individual plots for sale, creating one of Bangkok's first planned residential and commercial districts.[^19] Among the most significant transactions was his sale of approximately 12 acres to the British Government in 1922 for their new embassy.[^20] At the time, the move was considered highly questionable due to the remote location, but Nai Lert's vision proved prescient—by 2017, when the Foreign Office sold 23 rai of the embassy land, it fetched over 18 billion baht (£420 million), making it the highest-priced real estate deal in Thailand's history.[^21]

On a portion of his Phloen Chit land holdings, Nai Lert created Nai Lert Park in 1915, designing it as Bangkok's first Western-style public park—predating even the royal initiative of Lumpini Park by King Rama VI in 1925.[^22] The 14-rai (2.24-hectare) park was built around his weekend residence, a beautiful teakwood bungalow constructed from lumber left over from the construction of American and Danish ocean liners and ships for the Royal Siamese Navy.[^23] Demonstrating his commitment to environmental preservation and public welfare, Nai Lert opened the park to the public for Scout camps and other activities, earning it the affectionate local name "Nai Lert Park."[^24]

### Architectural Innovation

In 1927, Nai Lert completed what would become one of Bangkok's most iconic buildings of the era—a seven-story "skyscraper" on Charoen Krung Road that stood as the tallest commercial building in Bangkok at its opening.[^25] This architectural marvel housed not only his retail emporium but also the Hotel de la Paix, a European-style bar, and his ice factory, creating an early example of mixed-use development.[^26] The building represented Nai Lert's understanding that Bangkok was ready for vertical development and modern commercial architecture, and it served as a symbol of Thailand's modernization during the reign of King Rama VI.

### Business Diversification

Beyond transportation and real estate, Nai Lert diversified his business empire to include numerous innovative ventures. He imported lemonade and European delicacies, introducing Bangkok's residents to new tastes and products from around the world.[^27] He established a shipyard, operated a department store, ran a hotel, and created a pioneering rent-a-car company using imported vehicles.[^28] His business acumen and willingness to take calculated risks on new technologies and services made him one of Siam's most successful entrepreneurs of the early 20th century.

### Royal Recognition

In recognition of his extraordinary contributions to Thai commerce and society, King Rama VI (Vajiravudh) bestowed upon Nai Lert the noble title Phraya Bhakdi Noraset in 1925, meaning "Beloved Millionaire."[^29] This royal honor reflected not only his business success but also his reputation for fair dealing, innovation, and service to the kingdom. The title elevated him to the ranks of the Thai nobility and cemented his status as one of the kingdom's most respected business leaders.

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Nai Lert is generally remembered positively in Thai history, some aspects of his legacy have generated discussion and mild controversy. The most notable involves the Chao Mae Tuptim shrine, a fertility shrine located on his property.[^30] According to legend, Nai Lert found a spirit house floating in the khlong (canal) behind his land around 1920 and fished it out, erecting it on his property.[^31] The shrine became dedicated to Chao Mae Tuptim, a female animist deity, and gained fame when women who made offerings there reportedly became pregnant.[^32]

Over time, the shrine accumulated thousands of wooden phalluses brought as offerings, earning it the colloquial name "the penis shrine."[^33] While the shrine has cultural and religious significance, its presence created challenges for later generations. The Nai Lert Park Hotel expressed dismay about having the shrine on their doorstep and attempted to discourage tourists from walking through the hotel to access it.[^34] Eventually, the shrine was relocated to the Nai Lert Heritage Home after the original lot was purchased and expanded into a nearby hospital.[^35] The controversy reflects the tension between preserving traditional spiritual practices and managing modern commercial properties.

Another area of historical discussion involves the nationalization of Bangkok's bus companies, including the family-run White Bus Company.[^36] While this was part of broader government policy rather than specific criticism of Nai Lert's operations, it did represent a significant loss of family business assets. However, there is no evidence in the historical record of widespread criticism of Nai Lert's business practices during his lifetime. On the contrary, his royal title and continued success suggest he was respected for his fair dealing and contributions to Thai society.

The sale of land to foreign governments, particularly the British Embassy plot, may have raised nationalist concerns among some Thais, though no specific contemporary criticism survives in the English-language historical record. Such transactions were common during the period as Siam modernized and established diplomatic relations with Western powers.

## Personal Life

Nai Lert shared his life and business empire with his beloved wife, Khunying Sinn (Thevit), whom he married in the late 19th century.[^37] Their partnership was both personal and professional, with Khunying Sinn playing an active role in the family's philanthropic endeavors. The couple had one daughter, Lursakdi, born in 1919, who would later become Thanpuying Lursakdi Sampatisiri following her marriage to Khun Binich Sampatisiri in 1930.[^38]

The family maintained residences in multiple locations. Before building their weekend retreat, Nai Lert and Khunying Sinn lived in a house on Charoen Krung Road in the heart of Bangkok's commercial district.[^39] However, as Khunying Sinn suffered from frail health and the pollution of the busy commercial area affected her wellbeing, the couple increasingly retreated to their Nai Lert Park property, which offered tranquility and fresh air amid lush gardens and preserved jungle.[^40] The residence, designed by Nai Lert himself in 1915, featured beautiful teakwood construction and was surrounded by scenic grounds along the Saen Saep Canal, with towering preserved trees and inviting grassy paths.[^41]

Nai Lert's personality was marked by both innovation and tradition. While he enthusiastically embraced Western technology and business practices, he remained firmly committed to preserving Thai culture and traditions.[^42] He was known for his personal style, occasionally driving his imported Fiat around Bangkok with his pet leopard, Tam, as a companion—a detail that captures both his wealth and his eccentric flair.[^43] He enjoyed entertaining friends at his weekend home and was known for his hospitality and openness, as evidenced by his decision to open Nai Lert Park to the public for recreational use.[^44]

Khunying Sinn was remembered for her culinary skills, with signature dishes like hormok khao and mee nam park nai lert that are still served at the heritage home's restaurant today.[^45] She was also a philanthropist in her own right, founding Lerd-Sinn Hospital, which was built and donated to the government of Thailand.[^46] The hospital, along with the Lerd-Sinn Foundation named after the couple, continues their legacy of service to Thai society.

## Legacy

Nai Lert died on December 15, 1945, just months after the end of World War II, at the age of 73.[^47] His death came during a turbulent period—during the war, Allied aircraft aiming for the nearby Makkasan railway station had inadvertently dropped 22 bombs on his property, damaging one of the two houses, which was later rebuilt in 1945, the year of his passing.[^48] He left his business empire to his wife, Khunying Sinn, and their daughter, Thanpuying Lursakdi Sampatisiri.[^49]

When Lursakdi inherited the business empire at just 27 years old, she faced the challenge of leading a major commercial enterprise in an era when women rarely held such positions.[^50] She proved herself a formidable leader, expanding the family's interests and demonstrating business acumen that matched her father's. In 1984, she created one of Bangkok's first international luxury hotels, the Hilton International Bangkok at Nai Lert Park, bringing international hospitality standards to Thailand.[^51] The hotel underwent several rebranding transitions, operating as Swissôtel Nai Lert Park Bangkok and later becoming Mövenpick BDMS Wellness Resort Bangkok in 2019.[^52] In 2025, the property opened as Aman Nai Lert Bangkok, representing a new chapter for the historic location.[^53]

Lursakdi's achievement of becoming Thailand's first female Cabinet minister added political significance to the family legacy. After the government nationalized the Bangkok bus companies, she was invited by Prime Minister Tanin Kraivixien to join his Cabinet as Minister of Transport in 1976, making history as the first woman to hold a ministerial position in a Thai government.[^54]

The Nai Lert Group continues to operate today as a multi-generational family business, focusing on real estate, hospitality, education, and culture divisions.[^55] Lursakdi's daughters, Bilhaiban Sampatisiri and Sanhapit Bodiratnangkura, and her granddaughter, Naphaporn Bodiratnangkura, have all been engaged in continuing the family business, now spanning four generations from Nai Lert's original founding.[^56]

In 2012, the family made the unanimous decision to convert their private residence into a heritage property to share with the broader community.[^57] After nearly three years of restoration work, the Nai Lert Park Heritage Home reopened to the public in 2016 as a museum filled with historical memorabilia from three generations.[^58] The heritage home preserves the teak wooden floors, pillars, and century-old trees, offering visitors a glimpse into Bangkok's transformation from a canal-based society to a modern metropolis.[^59]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians of Thai economic development recognize Nai Lert as a pioneering figure who played a crucial role in Bangkok's modernization during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is consistently described as "Thailand's first and foremost developer, investor as well as preserver of Bangkok's environment," reflecting his dual commitment to progress and conservation.[^60] His introduction of modern transportation systems—buses, taxis, and ferry services—fundamentally transformed urban mobility in Bangkok and laid the groundwork for the city's future development as a major Asian metropolis.

Real estate historians particularly praise his visionary master planning of the Phloen Chit area, which demonstrated sophisticated understanding of urban development principles decades ahead of its time.[^61] His decision to create Bangkok's first Western-style public park before even the royal Lumpini Park initiative shows his commitment to public welfare and green spaces in urban environments.[^62] Environmental historians note that he "acquired this tract of pristine jungle with the purpose of building a home and ultimately to preserve its natural beauty in perpetuity," demonstrating early environmental consciousness rare for his era.[^63]

Business historians celebrate Nai Lert as an exemplar of entrepreneurial innovation and diversification. His willingness to take risks on new technologies—whether ice manufacturing, motorized vehicles, or vertical architecture—demonstrated the kind of calculated risk-taking essential for economic development.[^64] The royal title of "Beloved Millionaire" bestowed by King Rama VI suggests he was respected not merely for his wealth but for his character and contributions to society.[^65]

The family's continued success across four generations, maintaining and expanding Nai Lert's original business empire, is often cited as evidence of the solid foundations he built. The transformation of his private residence into a public heritage site in 2016 has been praised as an act of cultural stewardship, allowing future generations to understand Bangkok's developmental history through the lens of one influential family.[^66]

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of Nai Lert's legacy are relatively sparse in the historical record, though some scholars note the limitations of celebrating individual entrepreneurs without acknowledging broader structural factors. Critics of the "great man" theory of history point out that Nai Lert's success depended heavily on his privileged position within the Thai-Chinese merchant class, his family connections, and the economic opportunities created by Siam's integration into global trade networks during the reigns of modernizing monarchs.[^67]

Some historians question whether his innovations were truly original or simply the local implementation of technologies and business models already proven in other countries. The claim that he introduced "the first" bus service, ice factory, or taxi company might be more accurately described as being among the first to successfully commercialize these foreign innovations in the Thai context.[^68]

From a labor history perspective, there is limited documentation of working conditions in Nai Lert's various enterprises, wages paid to employees, or his relationship with workers—an absence that some scholars find troubling given the era's general lack of labor protections.[^69] The nationalization of the family's bus company by the Thai government could be interpreted as evidence that private monopolies on essential public services were seen as problematic, though this occurred after Nai Lert's death.[^70]

Urban planning critics might also question the social equity implications of his real estate developments, which primarily served wealthy and foreign residents. The sale of prime Bangkok land to foreign embassies, while commercially astute, could be viewed as prioritizing profit over national interests during a period when Siam was navigating complex colonial pressures from European powers.[^71]

The Chao Mae Tuptim shrine controversy, while relatively minor, reflects potential tensions between Nai Lert's business interests and traditional spiritual practices. Some critics suggest that his installation of the fertility shrine may have been motivated more by superstition and personal belief than by genuine respect for animist traditions, though such criticism is speculative given limited historical documentation of his motivations.[^72]
