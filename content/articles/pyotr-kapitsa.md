## Summary

Pyotr Kapitsa was a Soviet physicist who shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics. He discovered superfluidity of liquid helium and made major contributions to the understanding of strong magnetic fields. Kapitsa was famously detained in the Soviet Union by Stalin after visiting in 1934 and was not allowed to return to Cambridge. He later became director of the Institute for Physical Problems in Moscow.
