## 1. Introduction: The Preventive Genocide
The **Bodo League Massacre** is a forgotten holocaust of the Korean War. In the summer of 1950, as North Korean troops invaded, the South Korean government under President **Syngman Rhee** ordered the summary execution of suspected leftists. Between 100,000 and 200,000 civilians—many of them innocent farmers forced into a state-run "re-education" league—were murdered in a matter of weeks. The massacre was hidden for 50 years, with the complicity of the U.S. military.

## 2. Background: The National Guidance Alliance
Following the brutal suppression of the Jeju 4.3 Uprising (1948) and the Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion, Rhee sought to control the population.
*   **Creation:** In 1949, official prosecutors created the *Gukmin Bodo Yeonmaeng* (National Guidance Alliance). It was ostensibly a group to "re-educate" former communists.
*   **The Quota Trap:** Regional police chiefs were given strict quotas to fill.
    *   **Coercion:** To meet numbers, police forced villagers with no political ideology to sign up.
    *   **Incentives:** Starving peasants were told they would receive rations of rice or barley if they put their thumbprint on the list.
    *   **Scale:** By 1950, the list contained **300,000 names**. Most were simple farmers who could not read the paper they signed.

## 3. The Execution Order (June 1950)
On June 25, 1950, the Korean War began. The Rhee administration feared the Bodo League members would act as a "fifth column" for the North.
*   **The Order:** Rhee ordered the execution of all "potential enemies."
*   **The Roundup:** As the ROK (Republic of Korea) army retreated, Military Police (MP) and Right-wing youth groups arrested league members from their homes. They were detained in warehouses and factories.

## 4. The Killing Fields
The executions happened systematically across the peninsula.

### Gyeongsan Cobalt Mines
In Gyeongsan, approximately 3,500 people were trucked to abandoned cobalt mines.
*   **The Design:** Prisoners were tied together in pairs with telephone wire. They were lined up at the lip of deep vertical mine shafts.
*   **The Method:** Executioners would shoot one person or smash their skull with a hammer. As they fell, their weight dragged the living person tied to them down into the shaft. This method was chosen to save bullets.

### Daejeon Prison and Trenches
In Daejeon, thousands were executed in the valleys.
*   **Trenches:** Prisoners were forced to dig long trenches. They were made to kneel at the edge, and MPs walked down the line shooting them in the back of the head.
*   **U.S. Documentation:** U.S. Army Major Abbott visited the site and took detailed photographs of the massacre. The photos show hundreds of bodies and white-clad peasants waiting to die.

## 5. U.S. Complicity
For decades, the U.S. government denied knowledge of the atrocities. Declassified documents prove otherwise.
*   **CIC Reports:** U.S. Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) officers monitored and reported on the executions.
*   **Policy of Non-Interference:** The U.S. command viewed the "cleanup" as a necessary internal security measure to secure the rear areas. General MacArthur reportedly knew of the orders. While British diplomats protested and saved some lives, the U.S. largely stood by.

## 6. The Cover-Up and Erasure
*   **State Secret:** After the war, Rhee and subsequent military dictators (Park Chung-hee) made it a crime to mention the massacre. The government blamed the mass graves on the North Korean army.
*   **Guilt by Association:** Families of victims were labeled "reds." They were put on government watchlists and barred from holding civil service jobs or traveling abroad for decades.
*   **Physical Sealing:** The cobalt mines were sealed with concrete to prevent bones from being found.

## 7. Reckoning
*   **2005 TRC:** Under the liberal presidency of Roh Moo-hyun, the **Truth and Reconciliation Commission** was established.
*   **The Excavations:** In 2007, forensic teams cracked open the cobalt mines. They found layers of human bones tangled in the original telephone wire, confirming the survivors' testimonies.
*   **Official Apology:** In 2008, President Roh officially apologized for the state's illegal abuse of power. However, full compensation for the families remains a legal and political battleground.
