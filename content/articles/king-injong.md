## Summary

King Injong of Goryeo (1109-1146), personal name Wang Hae, was the 17th monarch of the Korean Goryeo dynasty who ruled from 1122 to 1146.[^1][^2] His reign was marked by extraordinary political turbulence, including two major rebellions that nearly ended the Goryeo dynasty: the coup d'état by his maternal grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm in 1126 and the Myocheong Rebellion of 1135.[^3][^4] Despite these challenges, Injong oversaw significant cultural achievements, most notably commissioning the compilation of the Samguk Sagi, the oldest extant record of Korean history, and presiding over the development of movable metal type printing.[^5][^6] His reign also witnessed major geopolitical shifts, including the collapse of the Northern Song dynasty and Goryeo's submission to the Jin dynasty as a vassal state.[^7][^8]

## Early Life and Background

Wang Hae was born on October 29, 1109, as the eldest son of King Yejong and Queen Sundeok of the Gyeongwon Yi clan.[^9][^10] His mother, Queen Sundeok, was born on April 15, 1094, as the second daughter of the powerful aristocrat Yi Cha-gyŏm and Lady Ch'oe.[^11] When the king learned that the baby was a boy, he sent an envoy to issue a decree and expressed his joy by giving Queen Sundeok silverware, silk, horses, wood, and grain.[^12] This birth cemented the alliance between the royal house and the powerful Yi clan, though it would later prove to be a source of political instability.

Injong ascended to the throne at the young age of twelve and a half in 1122, in accordance with the third of the Ten Injunctions of Taejo, as "the eldest legitimate royal issue."[^13] His succession became possible largely due to the influence of his maternal grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm, who dominated the court and effectively controlled the young king.[^14] The early years of Injong's reign were characterized by his grandfather's overwhelming political power, which overshadowed the young monarch's authority and created factional tensions at court.

As a member of the Goryeo royal house, Injong was educated in Confucian classics and trained in the arts of governance, though his youth and inexperience made him vulnerable to manipulation by powerful court figures.[^15] The political environment he inherited was one of increasing tension between the central aristocracy based in Kaegyŏng (modern Kaesong) and provincial elites, particularly those from the Western Capital region of Seogyeong (Pyongyang).[^16] This regional rivalry would become a defining feature of his reign and ultimately contribute to major political crises.

## Rise to Power

Injong's path to the throne was secured primarily through his status as the eldest legitimate son of King Yejong, but his maternal grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm's political machinations played an equally crucial role.[^17] Yi Cha-gyŏm had consolidated enormous power at court by marrying his daughters to successive kings, creating a network of influence that dominated Goryeo politics in the early 12th century.[^18] When Injong ascended the throne in 1122, he was essentially a puppet of his grandfather's faction, unable to exercise independent authority.

The early years of Injong's reign were dominated by Yi Cha-gyŏm, who held the position of supreme chancellor and controlled both civil and military appointments.[^19] Historical records suggest that Yi Cha-gyŏm harbored ambitions to usurp the throne entirely, and there were reports that he intended to poison the young king to clear his path to power.[^20] However, Yi's overreach eventually provoked resistance from other court factions and provincial leaders who feared the complete erosion of royal authority.

In 1126, when Injong was seventeen years old, he attempted his first major assertion of royal power by conspiring with close advisers to eliminate Yi Cha-gyŏm from the court.[^21] On February 25, 1126, Injong's forces stormed Yi's compound and killed Ch'ŏk Chun-sin and Ch'ŏk Sun, the younger brother and son of Ch'ŏk Chun-gyŏng, Yi's close military ally.[^22] However, the coup failed catastrophically when Ch'ŏk Chun-gyŏng, consumed with rage upon discovering the bodies of his brother and son, launched a counter-coup the following day.[^23]

Ch'ŏk's forces set the entire royal palace ablaze, destroying tens of thousands of books in the royal library and national academy, and forcing Injong to flee and seek refuge in a pavilion north of the palace by the lake.[^24][^25] The young king was captured, imprisoned, and effectively deposed by his own grandfather.[^26] For several months, Injong remained a prisoner while Yi Cha-gyŏm contemplated whether to kill him or install a more compliant successor.

Injong's restoration came through an unexpected turn of events. Ch'ŏk Chun-gyŏng, initially Yi Cha-gyŏm's strongest military supporter, became incensed by Yi's attempts to assassinate the king and switched his allegiance to Injong.[^27] In May 1126, Ch'ŏk stormed the palace while Yi was occupied with state affairs and moved Injong to a secure location.[^28] With the aid of provincial leaders who feared Yi's usurpation, Injong successfully regained power in 1127.[^29][^30] Yi Cha-gyŏm was exiled to Yeonggwang and died in December of 1126, while Ch'ŏk himself was impeached and sent into exile in 1127.[^31][^32]

## Major Achievements

Despite the political chaos that characterized his reign, King Injong presided over several remarkable cultural and administrative achievements that left a lasting impact on Korean civilization.

### The Samguk Sagi

Injong's most enduring legacy is his commission of the Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms), the oldest surviving chronicle of Korean history.[^33][^34] In 1142, Injong ordered the Confucian scholar and court official Kim Busik to compile a comprehensive historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.[^35] Kim Busik, leading a team of fourteen authors, completed the work in late 1145 or early 1146, just before Injong's death.[^36]

The Samguk Sagi is divided into 50 books and follows the Chinese historiographical tradition, including 28 chapters of annals, 9 chapters of monographs, tables, and biographies.[^37] The work was based on the Gu Samguksa (Old History of the Three Kingdoms) and other earlier historical records, most of which are no longer extant.[^38] Kim Busik drew generously from Chinese dynastic chronicles including the Records of the Three Kingdoms, Book of Wei, Book of Jin, Old Book of Tang, New Book of Tang, and the Zizhi Tongjian.[^39]

Kim Busik wanted to educate Korean scholars about their native history and establish Korean historical figures as exemplars of Confucian values.[^40] The Samguk Sagi has become an invaluable reference work since many of the ancient sources it drew upon have since been lost, including all 69 Korean texts referred to in the bibliography.[^41] This achievement demonstrated Injong's commitment to preserving Korean cultural identity and promoting Confucian learning, even amid political turmoil.

### Development of Movable Metal Type

One of the most significant technological achievements during Injong's reign was the development of printing with movable metal type, a Korean innovation that predated Gutenberg's European printing press by more than two centuries.[^42] This development was directly motivated by the catastrophic palace fire of 1126, when Yi Ja-gyeom's forces burned the royal library and national academy, destroying tens of thousands of books.[^43][^44]

The urgent need to replace lost books spurred innovations in printing technology, leading to the creation of movable metal type during Injong's reign.[^45] While the exact date of this invention is debated, Korean movable type is recognized to have been developed during the Goryeo dynasty by at least the early part of the 13th century, with the oldest documented use of moveable metal type dating from 1234.[^46][^47] The technology represented a revolutionary advance in book production and knowledge dissemination, and Korea would remain a leader in this field for centuries.

### Administrative Reforms

Injong implemented important administrative reforms aimed at centralizing royal control over local governance. In 1143, he appointed fourteen local magistrates, making another significant step in bringing local administration under central control.[^48][^49] As a result of the reforms initiated by his father Yejong and continued by Injong, about one third of Goryeo's 450 or so prefectures and counties came under direct control of the central government.[^50]

These reforms were crucial for strengthening royal authority after the destabilizing effects of Yi Cha-gyŏm's rebellion and for countering the influence of powerful provincial aristocratic families. Injong also established schools in rural areas to train the sons of provincial aristocrats for positions in the central government, creating a pathway for broader participation in governance while simultaneously binding provincial elites to the central court.[^51]

### Construction of Taehwa Palace

In 1129, Injong issued an edict commanding the construction of a palace in Pyongyang, known as the Great Flowering Palace (Taehwa-gung), to "revitalize our politics and [...] forever bestow felicity upon the following generations."[^52] The palace was completed in 1132, and Injong began to spend extended periods of time there.[^53] This construction project was influenced by the geomancer and Buddhist monk Myo Cheong, who appeared at court in 1127 and officially became political adviser to Injong in 1128.[^54]

The palace represented both an attempt to accommodate provincial interests, particularly those of the Western Capital faction, and Injong's effort to project royal authority through monumental architecture. However, the project ultimately became a source of political division and contributed to the tensions that led to Myocheong's Rebellion.

## Controversies and Criticisms

King Injong's reign, while culturally productive, was plagued by political failures and controversial decisions that weakened the Goryeo dynasty and sparked violent conflicts.

### Weak Leadership and Manipulation

Perhaps the most persistent criticism of Injong concerns his weak and indecisive leadership. From his accession at age twelve until his death at thirty-six, Injong struggled to assert independent royal authority.[^55] His early reign was entirely dominated by his grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm, and even after regaining power in 1127, he remained vulnerable to manipulation by court factions.[^56] His inability to maintain control over powerful advisers led directly to two major rebellions that nearly destroyed the dynasty.

Both Injong and his consort Queen Gongye are recorded as having misgivings about their oldest son Prince Hyeon, doubting his ability to rule, yet Injong failed to address succession concerns decisively.[^57] This indecisiveness would prove consequential, as Prince Hyeon (King Uijong) later became a weak ruler who was deposed in a military coup in 1170, leading to decades of military rule in Goryeo.[^58]

### The Myocheong Rebellion

The Myocheong Rebellion of 1135 represented a fundamental crisis of Injong's reign and exposed deep ideological and regional divisions within Goryeo society.[^59] Myocheong, a Buddhist monk and geomancer, had gained Injong's favor and proposed moving the capital to Seogyeong (Pyongyang), claiming that Kaegyŏng's feng shui was losing its good energy and that Pyongyang possessed very strong and positive energy.[^60][^61] Myocheong urged Injong to declare himself emperor, institute his own era name, and attack the "arrogant Jin."[^62]

Injong's indecisive response to Myocheong's proposals alienated both the reformist faction and the conservative Confucian aristocracy. While he authorized the construction of Taehwa Palace in Pyongyang, he ultimately sided with Kim Busik and the Kaegyŏng-based aristocracy in rejecting the capital relocation.[^63] Disappointed by the rate of reforms, Injong's insufficiently decisive stance against Jin, and alarmed by purges of his supporters, Myo Cheong rebelled in 1135.[^64]

At the Western Capital, the rebels declared a new state of Taewi (Great Accomplishment) and launched an uprising that threatened to partition the kingdom.[^65][^66] Injong ordered Kim Busik to suppress the insurrection, and after a prolonged military campaign, the rebellion was defeated in early 1136 when Myo Cheong was assassinated by his own army and Pyongyang fell to government forces.[^67][^68] The rebellion resulted in significant loss of life and deepened regional animosities between the central and provincial aristocracies.

### Submission to Jin Dynasty

One of the most controversial aspects of Injong's foreign policy was Goryeo's submission to the Jin dynasty as a vassal state. When the Jurchen Jin dynasty conquered the Liao in 1125 and captured the Song capital of Kaifeng in 1127, Goryeo faced a strategic dilemma.[^69][^70] Kim Busik and Yi Cha-gyŏm convinced Injong and the reluctant officials to submit to Jin, despite significant opposition from those who viewed the Jurchens as barbarians and preferred maintaining ties with Song China.[^71]

In 1126, Goryeo declared itself a Jin vassal, and the embassy to Jin sent that year presented the submission of Goryeo in proper terms.[^72][^73] In September 1127, Goryeo sent an envoy to congratulate the Jin emperor's birthday and received an official letter from the emperor.[^74] In 1142, Injong was formally invested as a vassal of the Jin dynasty.[^75] This submission was viewed by many as a humiliating abandonment of Goryeo's traditional cultural and diplomatic orientation toward Chinese civilization, even though it secured territorial concessions and peace with the powerful Jin empire.

Relations with the Song were practically broken for several years following Goryeo's submission to Jin. A request by Injong in 1129 to send an embassy was denied, while the embassy dispatched in 1132 was shipwrecked.[^76] Critics argued that Injong had sacrificed Goryeo's dignity and betrayed its civilizational affinities for short-term security.

---

## Personal Life

Injong's personal life was marked by complex family relationships and the burdens of premature kingship. He married multiple consorts during his reign, including: (1) Deposed Princess Yeondeok of the Incheon I clan (c. 1110-1139); (2) Deposed Princess Bokchang of the Incheon I clan (c. 1115-1195); (3) Queen Gongye of the Jangheung Im clan (1109-1183); and (4) Queen Seonpyeong of the Gyeongju (or Gangneung) Gim clan (c. 1115-1179).[^77]

Both Injong and Queen Gongye are recorded as having serious doubts about their oldest son Prince Hyeon's capacity to rule, with Queen Gongye preferring the second son Prince Kyeong as the next king.[^78] Nevertheless, Prince Hyeon succeeded to the throne as King Uijong following Injong's death, in accordance with primogeniture succession customs.[^79] King Myeongjong, who later became the 19th ruler of Goryeo, was Injong's third son.[^80]

The relationship between Injong and his maternal grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm profoundly shaped his personality and reign. Having been dominated and imprisoned by his own grandfather, Injong developed a cautious and sometimes indecisive approach to governance.[^81] The trauma of the 1126 palace fire, when he was forced to flee burning buildings and seek refuge by the lake, likely contributed to his reluctance to confront powerful advisers directly.[^82]

Historical sources suggest that Injong was a cultured monarch who valued learning and the arts. His commission of the Samguk Sagi and support for printing technology demonstrate his commitment to scholarship and cultural preservation.[^83] However, these intellectual interests may have come at the expense of political acumen and decisive leadership, qualities desperately needed during a period of intense factional competition and geopolitical upheaval.

## Legacy

King Injong died on April 10, 1146, at the age of thirty-six after reigning for twenty-four years.[^84] His tomb, called Jangneung, was reportedly placed south of the royal capital, though later sources state it was located in Byeokgot-dong to the west of Gaeseong, and its exact location remains uncertain.[^85][^86]

Injong's legacy is profoundly ambivalent. On one hand, he presided over remarkable cultural achievements that shaped Korean civilization for centuries. The Samguk Sagi remains the foundational text for understanding ancient Korean history, and the development of movable metal type printing during his reign represented a technological breakthrough of world-historical significance.[^87][^88] His administrative reforms strengthened central government control and helped stabilize Goryeo's governance structure.

On the other hand, Injong's weak leadership and inability to manage court factions contributed to political instability that would plague Goryeo for generations. The succession of his son Uijong, whom both he and Queen Gongye had doubted, led to further deterioration of royal authority.[^89] In 1170, Uijong was deposed in a military coup led by warriors Chŏng Chung-bu, Yi Ŭi-bang, and Yi Ko, ushering in decades of military rule known as the Goryeo military regime.[^90] After his deposition, Uijong was eventually thrown into a pond and drowned by the military regime in 1173.[^91]

The Myocheong Rebellion during Injong's reign represented a turning point in Goryeo's ideological orientation. By suppressing the rebellion and siding with Kim Busik's Confucian-oriented Kaegyŏng aristocracy, Injong determined that Goryeo would remain aligned with Confucian governance principles rather than embrace Myocheong's Buddhist and geomantic worldview.[^92] This decision reinforced the dominance of Confucian scholarship in Korean political culture, though it came at the cost of alienating provincial elites and Buddhist institutions.

Injong's submission to the Jin dynasty as a vassal state established a pragmatic foreign policy that prioritized security over prestige. While criticized as humiliating, this policy preserved Goryeo's independence and territorial integrity during a period of dramatic geopolitical transformation in East Asia.[^93][^94] The collapse of the Northern Song and rise of the Jin fundamentally altered the regional balance of power, and Injong's accommodation with the new hegemon ensured Goryeo's survival.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern and traditional scholars have recognized several positive aspects of Injong's reign, particularly his cultural patronage and administrative reforms. The commission of the Samguk Sagi stands as his most celebrated achievement, and historians credit Injong with preserving invaluable historical knowledge that would otherwise have been lost.[^95] Kim Busik's compilation, undertaken at Injong's command, established historiographical standards and methodologies that influenced Korean historical writing for centuries.[^96]

Injong's support for technological innovation, particularly the development of movable metal type printing to replace books lost in the 1126 palace fire, demonstrated his commitment to learning and cultural advancement.[^97] Scholars note that this innovation placed Korea at the forefront of printing technology worldwide, more than two centuries before Gutenberg's press in Europe.[^98]

His administrative reforms, including the appointment of fourteen local magistrates in 1143, are viewed as important steps toward strengthening central governance and reducing the power of provincial aristocratic families.[^99] These reforms, building on his father Yejong's initiatives, brought approximately one-third of Goryeo's prefectures and counties under direct central government control, enhancing royal authority.[^100]

Some historians argue that Injong's pragmatic foreign policy, including submission to the Jin dynasty, demonstrated strategic wisdom rather than weakness. By acknowledging Jin supremacy, he secured territorial concessions and avoided destructive military conflict during a period when Goryeo lacked the military capacity to resist the Jurchen forces that had conquered both the Liao and Northern Song.[^101]

### Negative Views

Critics of Injong's reign focus primarily on his weak leadership and the political chaos that characterized his rule. The fact that he was dominated by his grandfather Yi Cha-gyŏm for the early years of his reign, imprisoned during a failed coup attempt, and forced to rely on military strongmen like Ch'ŏk Chun-gyŏng to regain power demonstrates his fundamental inability to establish independent royal authority.[^102]

The Myocheong Rebellion is often cited as evidence of Injong's indecisive leadership. By initially encouraging Myocheong's proposals, including the construction of Taehwa Palace in Pyongyang, but then failing to follow through with the capital relocation, Injong alienated reformist provincial elites without fully satisfying conservative Confucian aristocrats.[^103] His inability to manage these competing factions led to a costly rebellion that required military suppression and deepened regional divisions.

Scholars critical of Confucian hegemony view Injong's suppression of the Myocheong Rebellion as a missed opportunity for Goryeo to embrace a more distinctly Korean identity rooted in Buddhist and geomantic traditions rather than Chinese Confucian models.[^104] Myocheong's vision of an independent Korean empire with its capital in Pyongyang represented an alternative path that Injong rejected in favor of accommodation with both Chinese cultural models and Jurchen political supremacy.

The submission to Jin is viewed by nationalist historians as a humiliating capitulation that sacrificed Korean dignity and autonomy. The fact that Injong was formally invested as a vassal of the Jin in 1142 is seen as evidence of his willingness to accept subordinate status rather than defend Korean independence.[^105]

Perhaps most damaging to Injong's historical reputation is the fact that his son and successor Uijong proved to be an even weaker ruler, whose incompetence led directly to the military coup of 1170 and decades of military rule.[^106] Both Injong and Queen Gongye had doubted Prince Hyeon's ability to rule, yet Injong failed to address succession concerns, allowing an unsuitable heir to ascend the throne and precipitate a constitutional crisis that undermined the dynasty for generations.[^107]

## Famous Quotes

> "To revitalize our politics and [...] forever bestow felicity upon the following generations" - Injong's 1129 edict ordering construction of Taehwa Palace in Pyongyang[^127]

While specific quotations directly attributed to King Injong are scarce in surviving historical records, his edicts and policies reveal his governing philosophy. The above quote from his 1129 edict demonstrates his attempt to balance regional interests and embrace geomantic ideas promoted by Myocheong, even though he ultimately failed to follow through with the capital relocation.

> "The misfortunes originated from Kaegyŏng's feng shui" - Myocheong's advice to Injong regarding the capital relocation[^128]

This quote, while attributed to Myocheong rather than Injong, captures the geomantic ideology that influenced significant decisions during Injong's reign. His initial receptivity to such ideas, followed by his ultimate rejection of them in favor of Kim Busik's Confucian orthodoxy, exemplifies the indecisiveness that characterized his rule.

The Samguk Sagi, commissioned by Injong, contains his royal edict commanding its compilation, which expressed his desire to preserve Korean history and establish Korean historical figures as exemplars of Confucian values.[^129] This commission reflects Injong's commitment to cultural preservation and scholarship, even amid the political chaos of his reign.
