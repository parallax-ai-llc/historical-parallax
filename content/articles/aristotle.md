## Summary

Aristotle (384-322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist who studied under Plato for 20 years at the Academy, tutored Alexander the Great, and founded his own school, the Lyceum. Unlike his teacher Plato who emphasized abstract Forms, Aristotle focused on empirical observation of the physical world, establishing many scientific fields including biology, physics, logic, ethics, politics, and poetics. His systematic approach to knowledge, emphasis on categorization and empirical study, and development of formal logic profoundly shaped Western thought for over 2,000 years. Islamic and Christian medieval philosophy was dominated by Aristotelian frameworks. His works on ethics (*Nicomachean Ethics*), politics, metaphysics, and natural science remain foundational texts in Western education.

## Core Philosophy

### Rejection of Platonic Forms

**Critique of Plato:**
- Forms unnecessary; essence in things themselves
- Can't explain change and motion
- "Third Man Argument" (infinite regress)
- Reality is substance (οὐσία) composed of matter and form

**Substance:**
- Individual things (this horse, that tree) are primary reality
- Not abstract universals
- Composed of matter (potential) and form (actuality)

### Four Causes

All things explained by four causes (αἰτίαι):
1. **Material Cause**: What it's made of (bronze)
2. **Formal Cause**: Its form/structure (statue of Athena)
3. **Efficient Cause**: What made it (sculptor)
4. **Final Cause**: Its purpose (honor goddess)

Understanding requires knowing all four.

### Teleology

**Purpose in Nature:**
- Nature acts for ends (τέλος, telos)
- Acorns grow to become oaks (final cause)
- Everything has natural purpose
- "Nature does nothing in vain"

### Potentiality and Actuality

**Change Explained:**
- Potentiality (δύναμις): What something can become
- Actuality (ἐνέργεια/ἐντελέχεια): What something is
- Change is movement from potential to actual
- Seed (potential oak) → Oak tree (actual)

---

## Logic and Science

### Organon (Logical Works)

**Formal Logic:**
- Created formal logic (syllogistic reasoning)
- Example:
  - All men are mortal (major premise)
  - Socrates is a man (minor premise)
  - Therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion)

**Categories:**
- Systematized knowledge into categories
- Substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, affection

### Scientific Method

**Empirical Observation:**
- Study nature through careful observation
- Collect data systematically
- Classify and categorize
- Induction from particular to universal

**Biology:**
- Father of zoology
- Classified 500+ animal species
- Dissected specimens
- Studied reproduction, anatomy
- Errors (e.g., brain for cooling blood) but remarkably accurate for era

**Physics:**
- Four elements: earth, water, air, fire
- Natural motion: heavy things fall, light things rise
- Celestial spheres of ether
- Earth center of universe (Geocentrism)
- Dominated until Copernicus/Galileo

---

## Ethics

### Nicomachean Ethics

**Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία):**
- Highest good: flourishing/happiness
- Not pleasure but virtuous activity
- Exercising reason excellently

**Virtue Ethics:**
- Virtue is excellence (ἀρετή)
- Acquired through practice (habituation)
- Golden Mean: virtue between extremes
  - Courage (between cowardice and recklessness)
  - Generosity (between stinginess and wastefulness)
  - Proper pride (between vanity and humility)

**Practical Wisdom (φρόνησις):**
- Phronesis: knowing how to act virtuously in situations
- Not abstract rules but practical judgment
- Developed through experience

**Highest Life:**
- Contemplation (θεωρία, theoria)
- Using reason to understand truth
- Divine activity (gods contemplate eternally)
- Most fulfilling human activity

---

## Politics

**Humans as Political Animals:**
- "Man is by nature a political animal"
- Polis (city-state) natural for humans
- Individual achieves fulfillment in community
- Ethics and politics inseparable

**Forms of Government:**
Classified by who rules and for whose benefit:
- **Good**: Monarchy (one), Aristocracy (few), Polity (many)
- **Corrupt**: Tyranny (one), Oligarchy (few), Democracy (many)
- Preferred mixed constitution (polity)

**Middle Class:**
- Best states have strong middle class
- Extremes of wealth/poverty destabilize
- Moderation in politics as in ethics

---

## Metaphysics

**God as Unmoved Mover:**
- Everything in motion must be moved by something
- Chain can't be infinite
- Must be Unmoved Mover: pure actuality, pure thought
- Thinks about thinking (νόησις νοήσεως)
- Doesn't intervene but attracts all things as final cause

**Being qua Being:**
- Metaphysics studies "being as being"
- What does it mean to exist?
- Substance primary category of being

---

## Poetics

**Tragedy:**
- Imitation (μίμησις) of serious action
- Catharsis (κάθαρσις): purging emotions through pity and fear
- Plot most important element
- Unity of action, time, place

**Components:**
- Plot, character, thought, diction, melody, spectacle
- Tragic hero has hamartia (flaw/error) leading to downfall

---

## Exile and Death

**Anti-Macedonian Sentiment:**
- Alexander died 323 BC
- Athens revolted against Macedon
- Aristotle charged with impiety (like Socrates)
- Fled Athens: "I will not let Athens sin twice against philosophy"

**Death:**
- Died 322 BC in Chalcis, age 62
- Natural causes (stomach illness)
- Left will freeing slaves, providing for family

---

## Legacy

**Medieval Period:**
- Works lost in West, preserved by Islamic scholars
- Translated to Arabic (Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes)
- Recovered in West 12th-13th centuries
-  Thomas Aquinas synthesized with Christianity
- Dominated medieval universities

**Modern Science:**
- Empirical method influential
- Biology classifications foundational
- Physics superseded by Newton, Einstein
- Logic basis for modern logic

**Philosophy:**
- Influenced every field
- Virtue ethics revival (20th century)
- Teleology debated
- Realism vs. Platonism
