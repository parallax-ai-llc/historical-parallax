## Summary

William Wilberforce (1759-1833) was a British politician, philanthropist, and evangelical Christian who led the parliamentary campaign against the British slave trade for over two decades. As a Member of Parliament, he introduced numerous bills to abolish the slave trade, finally succeeding with the Slave Trade Act of 1807, which prohibited the trade in the British Empire. He continued to campaign for the complete abolition of slavery itself, which was achieved with the Slavery Abolition Act 1833, passed just three days before his death. Beyond abolition, Wilberforce was a leading social reformer who championed causes including prison reform, education for the poor, and animal welfare, leaving an enduring legacy as one of history's most influential moral campaigners.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

William Wilberforce was born on August 24, 1759, in Hull, Yorkshire, to a wealthy merchant family. His father, Robert Wilberforce, was a prosperous merchant in the Baltic trade, and his mother, Elizabeth Bird, came from a well-connected family. The family's wealth would later provide Wilberforce with the financial independence to pursue his political and reformist ambitions without concern for personal gain.[^3]

Tragedy struck early when his father died in 1768 when William was just nine years old. He was sent to live with his uncle and aunt, William and Hannah Wilberforce, in Wimbledon. This period proved formative, as his aunt and uncle were evangelical Christians associated with George Whitefield and John Newton, the former slave ship captain turned abolitionist clergyman. The young Wilberforce was exposed to evangelical Christianity and early abolitionist sentiment, though his mother, alarmed by these "Methodist" influences, removed him from their care and returned him to Hull.[^4]

Wilberforce received his formal education at Hull Grammar School and later at St John's College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1776. At Cambridge, he lived a life of considerable social ease and privilege, enjoying the company of fellow students including the future Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger, who became his lifelong friend. His time at university was marked more by social activities, card games, and dining clubs than by rigorous academic study. Despite his lackadaisical approach to formal learning, Wilberforce possessed a brilliant mind, natural eloquence, and a charming personality that made him popular in elite social circles.[^5]

His Cambridge years also revealed a man of culture and refinement. Wilberforce had a beautiful singing voice and a love for literature and the arts. He was known for his wit, humor, and ability to engage in conversation on diverse subjects. These social gifts would later serve him well in the political arena, where persuasion and personal relationships were crucial to legislative success. The combination of his family's wealth, his elite education, and his natural charisma positioned Wilberforce perfectly for a career in politics, though few could have predicted the moral crusade that would define his life's work.[^6]

## Rise to Power

Wilberforce's entry into politics came remarkably early. In 1780, at the age of just 21, he was elected as Member of Parliament for Hull, capitalizing on his family's local prominence and spending approximately £8,000 on his campaign—a considerable sum that reflected both his wealth and ambition. His youth, eloquence, and charm quickly made him a notable figure in Parliament, though his early political positions were largely conventional for a young man of his class and time.[^7]

In 1784, Wilberforce sought and won election for Yorkshire, one of the most prestigious constituencies in England. This victory significantly elevated his political stature. Yorkshire was the largest county constituency, and representing it required considerable political skill and resources. The campaign was expensive and competitive, but Wilberforce's popularity and the support of his friend William Pitt, who had become Prime Minister in 1783, helped secure his success. The Pitt-Wilberforce friendship proved crucial; the two young men were part of a brilliant political generation that would reshape British politics.[^8]

The turning point in Wilberforce's life came during the winter of 1784-1785, when he underwent a profound religious conversion experience. While traveling through Europe, he began reading Philip Doddridge's "The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul" and the Greek New Testament. This period of intense spiritual reflection led to his evangelical conversion, which he described as the "great change." Initially, Wilberforce considered leaving politics for the clergy, believing that public life was incompatible with serious Christian commitment.[^9]

However, his meeting with John Newton, the former slave trader turned Anglican clergyman and author of "Amazing Grace," proved decisive. Newton counseled Wilberforce that he could serve God within Parliament rather than abandoning politics. This advice, combined with encouragement from Pitt and other friends, convinced Wilberforce that his calling was to remain in public life but to pursue moral and social reform. In his diary in 1787, Wilberforce wrote what became his mission statement: "God Almighty has set before me two great objects, the suppression of the Slave Trade and the Reformation of Manners."[^10]

The anti-slavery campaign became Wilberforce's primary political focus beginning in 1787, when he was approached by a group of evangelical Anglicans and Quakers who had formed a committee to abolish the slave trade. They needed a parliamentary champion with the eloquence, connections, and determination to lead the fight in the House of Commons. Wilberforce accepted this role, despite knowing it would be deeply unpopular with powerful commercial interests in Liverpool, Bristol, and London who profited enormously from the trade in enslaved Africans. His willingness to champion this controversial cause, armed with moral conviction and political skill, marked his transformation from a conventional politician into one of history's great reformers.[^11]

## Major Achievements

Wilberforce's paramount achievement was the abolition of the British slave trade, accomplished through the Slave Trade Act of 1807. This victory came after nearly twenty years of parliamentary struggle, during which Wilberforce introduced abolition bills repeatedly, only to see them defeated by pro-slavery interests who wielded enormous economic and political power. The West India lobby, representing plantation owners and merchants who profited from slavery, opposed abolition fiercely, arguing that it would destroy the British economy and undermine the nation's naval supremacy.[^12]

The campaign required extraordinary persistence and strategic brilliance. Wilberforce and his allies, including Thomas Clarkson, Granville Sharp, and Hannah More, pioneered modern advocacy techniques. They organized public petition campaigns that gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures, produced detailed evidence of the horrors of the Middle Passage, distributed pamphlets and images like the famous diagram of the slave ship Brookes showing enslaved people packed in inhumane conditions, and boycotted slave-produced sugar. These tactics mobilized public opinion in unprecedented ways, creating Britain's first mass human rights movement.[^13]

Wilberforce's parliamentary speeches were legendary for their moral force and emotional power. Though small in stature and often in poor health, his voice and eloquence commanded attention. In his first major abolition speech in 1789, he spoke for three and a half hours, meticulously detailing the brutality of the slave trade and appealing to his fellow members' conscience and Christianity. "You may choose to look the other way," he declared, "but you can never again say that you did not know." Despite the power of his oratory, the bill was defeated, as it would be many times over the following years.[^14]

The political landscape eventually shifted in Wilberforce's favor. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) demonstrated that enslaved people would fight for freedom, making slavery seem less stable and profitable. The war with France created opportunities for strategic arguments about naval policy. Evangelical Christianity grew in influence among the British middle classes, creating a larger constituency sympathetic to abolitionist arguments. After years of defeats, the tide turned, and on February 23, 1807, the House of Commons passed the Slave Trade Act by an overwhelming majority of 283 to 16. When the result was announced, the House erupted in cheers, and members turned to applaud Wilberforce, who sat with tears streaming down his face.[^15]

However, Wilberforce did not rest with this achievement. The 1807 Act only abolished the trade in slaves; it did not free those already enslaved in British colonies. For the remaining 26 years of his life, Wilberforce campaigned for complete emancipation. He worked with a new generation of abolitionists, including Thomas Fowell Buxton, who increasingly took the parliamentary lead as Wilberforce's health declined. The campaign for full abolition faced even stiffer resistance from plantation owners who stood to lose their "property" and economic foundation.[^16]

Beyond slavery, Wilberforce championed numerous other reforms that earned him recognition as one of Britain's foremost social reformers. He was instrumental in founding the Society for the Suppression of Vice and Encouragement of Virtue, which sought to reform public morals and behavior, though this organization became controversial for what critics saw as moral busybodying. He supported the Church Missionary Society and the British and Foreign Bible Society, both dedicated to spreading Christianity globally. He worked for improved conditions for child laborers, though his efforts here were less comprehensive than his anti-slavery work.[^17]

Wilberforce also supported prison reform, working alongside reformers like Elizabeth Fry to improve the horrific conditions in British prisons and reduce the use of capital punishment for minor crimes. He advocated for the protection of climbing boys (child chimney sweeps), limitations on working hours, and improved education for the poor through the establishment of Sunday Schools. He was also an early advocate for animal welfare, supporting the world's first legislation against animal cruelty. His 1809 speech supporting a bill to prevent bull-baiting demonstrated his consistent commitment to reducing suffering in all its forms.[^18]

In 1833, just before his death, Wilberforce witnessed Parliament pass the Slavery Abolition Act, which would emancipate approximately 800,000 enslaved people throughout most of the British Empire (the Act would take effect in 1834). Though he died three days after its passage and did not live to see its implementation, he knew that his life's second great object had been achieved. The Act represented not only a moral triumph but also a massive economic transformation, as the British government paid £20 million in compensation to slave owners (equivalent to roughly 40% of the national budget)—though nothing to the enslaved people themselves.[^19]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his moral legacy, Wilberforce has faced significant criticism from historians and contemporary observers on multiple grounds. One of the most serious charges is that his opposition to slavery was selective and inconsistent. While he campaigned tirelessly against the enslavement of Africans, he showed little sympathy for working-class British people suffering under industrial capitalism. Critics point out that Wilberforce opposed factory reform legislation, including limits on child labor in textile mills, and was hostile to labor unions and workers' rights movements.[^20]

This apparent contradiction revealed class bias. When workers at his own Yorkshire constituency faced economic hardship and hunger, Wilberforce supported the repressive Combination Acts that banned trade unions, and he backed the suspension of habeas corpus to suppress working-class political movements. During the Peterloo Massacre of 1819, when cavalry charged into a crowd of peaceful protesters demanding parliamentary reform, killing 15 and injuring hundreds, Wilberforce sided with the authorities rather than the victims. His moral vision seemed to extend across the Atlantic to enslaved Africans but not down the social scale to British laborers.[^21]

Historian E.P. Thompson famously criticized Wilberforce and his evangelical associates as being more concerned with the manners and morals of the poor than with their material conditions. The Society for the Suppression of Vice, which Wilberforce supported, prosecuted working-class people for gambling, drinking, and working on Sundays, while ignoring the vices of the wealthy. Critics saw this as hypocritical moralism that reinforced class hierarchies rather than challenging systemic injustice. "The devil's missionary to the laboring poor," one contemporary called him.[^22]

Wilberforce's opposition to political reform also drew criticism. He consistently opposed expanding the franchise or making Parliament more representative, even as the industrial revolution created new centers of population that had no parliamentary representation. His political conservatism stemmed partly from his evangelical belief that spiritual reform must precede political reform, and partly from his association with the Tory establishment. While he was radical on slavery, he was deeply conservative on the British class system and political structure.[^23]

His evangelical Christianity, while the source of his abolitionist commitment, also led him to support religious intolerance. Wilberforce backed laws that discriminated against Catholics, supporting the continuation of civil disabilities that prevented Catholics from holding many public offices. He also opposed granting civil rights to Jews and supported missionary efforts that sought to convert non-Christians, sometimes through methods that would now be considered cultural imperialism. His evangelical worldview, progressive on slavery, was conservative and sometimes intolerant on religious pluralism.[^24]

Some scholars have also questioned the hagiographic treatment of Wilberforce as the singular hero of abolition, arguing that this narrative minimizes the roles of others. Thomas Clarkson did much of the grueling investigative work documenting the slave trade's horrors, traveling thousands of miles to interview sailors and gather evidence. Olaudah Equiano and other Black abolitionists like Ignatius Sancho provided crucial testimony about the lived experience of slavery. Grassroots activists, particularly Quaker women who organized sugar boycotts, mobilized mass public opinion. Critics argue that focusing on Wilberforce as the "great man" of abolition obscures the reality that social change requires broad-based movements, not just elite parliamentary champions.[^25]

Recent scholarship has also examined the compensation paid to slave owners rather than enslaved people after abolition. While Wilberforce supported emancipation, he also supported compensating slave owners for their "property loss"—£20 million in public funds went to slaveholders while the enslaved received nothing. Some historians argue that this arrangement, which Wilberforce endorsed, prioritized property rights over human rights and left formerly enslaved people economically vulnerable while enriching those who had profited from their bondage.[^26]

Additionally, the Slavery Abolition Act of 1833 included provisions for "apprenticeship," a transition period during which formerly enslaved people would be required to work for their former owners without pay for four to six years. This system, which Wilberforce supported, was essentially continued slavery under a different name, and it was so abusive that it was ended early in 1838. Critics contend that Wilberforce's willingness to accept such compromises reflected the limits of his radicalism and his deference to property interests.[^27]

Wilberforce's personal lifestyle also drew criticism. Despite his evangelical piety and advocacy for the poor and enslaved, he lived in considerable comfort, maintained multiple residences, and never experienced the material hardships faced by those he championed. Some contemporaries and modern critics have seen a degree of paternalism and self-satisfaction in his philanthropy—the wealthy man dispensing charity and moral guidance from a position of unquestioned privilege.[^28]

## Personal Life

William Wilberforce married Barbara Ann Spooner on May 30, 1797, after a remarkably brief courtship of only eight days. The marriage was happy and produced six children: four sons (William, Robert, Samuel, and Henry) and two daughters (Barbara and Elizabeth). Barbara was deeply religious and shared her husband's evangelical convictions, providing him with emotional and spiritual support throughout his demanding political career. Their home life was characterized by strong Christian faith, with daily family prayers and Bible reading.[^29]

Despite his public prominence, Wilberforce was known for being a devoted family man who enjoyed spending time with his children. He was an affectionate and playful father, and his home in Clapham Common became a gathering place for the evangelical reformers known as the Clapham Sect. This group, which included Henry Thornton, Zachary Macaulay, and James Stephen, met regularly at Wilberforce's home to plan reform campaigns and discuss theology. The Clapham Sect represented a unique blend of evangelical piety, wealth, political influence, and commitment to social reform.[^30]

Physically, Wilberforce was small in stature, standing only about 5 feet 4 inches tall, and he suffered from poor health throughout his life. He experienced chronic digestive problems, eye weakness that sometimes made reading difficult, and severe curvature of the spine that became more pronounced as he aged. To manage his ailments, he took opium regularly, a common medical treatment of the era, which he continued for most of his adult life. Despite these physical limitations, his voice was strong and melodious, and his personality was magnetic. James Boswell famously said he was "as small a shrimp as ever I saw," but with "the mind of a giant."[^31]

His personality combined apparent contradictions. He could be both serious about moral issues and delightfully witty in social settings. He was known for his generosity, often giving away substantial sums to charitable causes and individuals in need, sometimes to the concern of his financial advisers. At the same time, he could be politically calculating when necessary, making strategic compromises to advance his reform agenda. His evangelical faith was absolutely central to his identity; he spent considerable time in prayer and Bible study, and he wrote the influential book "A Practical View of Christianity" (1797), which sold widely and articulated his evangelical theology.[^32]

Wilberforce's friendships were deep and influential. His relationship with William Pitt the Younger endured until Pitt's death in 1806, despite occasional political disagreements. Pitt's support was crucial in Wilberforce's early abolitionist efforts, though the Prime Minister's commitment to abolition was more pragmatic than moral. Wilberforce also maintained friendships with figures across the political spectrum, including the Whig leader Charles James Fox, with whom he allied on abolition despite their many other political differences. His ability to build coalitions across party lines was essential to his legislative success.[^33]

In his later years, as his health declined, Wilberforce gradually withdrew from active parliamentary life. He resigned his Yorkshire seat in 1812 due to health concerns and the expense of representing such a large constituency, taking instead the quieter seat of Bramber. He finally retired from Parliament entirely in 1825, though he continued to advise younger abolitionists like Thomas Fowell Buxton. His final years were spent in relative quiet, though he remained engaged with the emancipation campaign and saw its triumph shortly before his death.[^34]

Wilberforce died on July 29, 1833, at the age of 73, just three days after the Slavery Abolition Act passed its third reading in the House of Commons. His death was mourned nationally, and he was given the honor of burial in Westminster Abbey, near his friend William Pitt. The funeral was attended by both Houses of Parliament and prominent figures from across British society. His tomb became a symbol of Britain's moral progress and the power of persistent moral advocacy to achieve transformative social change.[^35]

## Legacy

William Wilberforce's legacy extends far beyond his own era, establishing him as one of history's most influential moral reformers and a symbol of conscience-driven political action. The abolition of the British slave trade and slavery itself represented one of the most significant moral achievements of the 19th century, eliminating an institution that had been economically and socially embedded in Western civilization for centuries. Wilberforce's role in this achievement, while not solitary, was central and inspirational.[^36]

The impact of British abolition rippled globally. Britain's decision to outlaw the slave trade had international consequences, as the Royal Navy subsequently established the West Africa Squadron to suppress the slave trade, intercepting slave ships and freeing enslaved people. While this effort had mixed results and sometimes masked imperial ambitions, it demonstrated that moral reform in one nation could have worldwide implications. British abolition also inspired anti-slavery movements in other countries, including the United States, where abolitionists like Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison drew inspiration from the British example.[^37]

Wilberforce's legacy established a model for faith-based social reform that influenced subsequent generations. He demonstrated that religious conviction could be channeled into effective political action on behalf of the vulnerable and oppressed. The evangelical activism he embodied inspired later movements including prison reform, temperance campaigns, labor rights advocacy, and various social purity movements. While not all of these movements were equally progressive or effective, they shared Wilberforce's conviction that moral principles should shape public policy.[^38]

In Britain, Wilberforce became a national hero and moral icon. Throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, he was held up as an exemplar of British virtue and progress, symbolizing the nation's transition from profiting from slavery to leading its abolition. Schools, churches, and institutions were named after him. Statues and memorials commemorated his work. The 2007 bicentenary of the Slave Trade Act saw renewed celebration of his achievements, with films, books, and exhibitions highlighting his role in abolition.[^39]

However, Wilberforce's legacy has become more contested in recent decades. Postcolonial scholarship has questioned narratives that center white British reformers as slavery's heroes while minimizing the agency and resistance of enslaved people themselves. Critics point out that slave revolts, marronage (escape), and constant resistance by enslaved people made slavery increasingly unstable and costly, creating economic conditions that made abolition more feasible. The Haitian Revolution, where enslaved people overthrew their masters and created an independent nation, demonstrated that freedom would be taken if not granted.[^40]

Additionally, focusing on Wilberforce can obscure the roles of Black abolitionists like Olaudah Equiano, Mary Prince, and others whose testimonies and activism were crucial to the movement. Modern commemorations increasingly seek to balance recognition of Wilberforce with acknowledgment of these other figures and the broader social forces that made abolition possible. The "Wilberforce myth"—the idea of a single great white savior freeing passive enslaved people—is now widely challenged by more complex historical narratives.[^41]

Wilberforce's legacy regarding workers' rights and political reform remains controversial. While celebrated for his anti-slavery work, his opposition to labor reforms and democratic expansion complicates his historical reputation. Some view him as a selective humanitarian whose moral vision had significant blind spots regarding class and political inequality. Others argue that his achievements on slavery should not be diminished by his failures on other issues, and that historical figures should be assessed in the context of their times rather than by contemporary standards.[^42]

In religious circles, particularly among evangelical Christians, Wilberforce remains a deeply admired figure. He is held up as an example of faith motivating social justice, of persistence in the face of repeated failure, and of using wealth and privilege on behalf of the powerless. Many contemporary faith-based social justice movements, from human trafficking advocacy to poverty alleviation efforts, explicitly draw inspiration from Wilberforce's example. Organizations like the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation continue his work by researching modern slavery and human trafficking.[^43]

Politically, Wilberforce's legacy is invoked across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives celebrate his evangelicalism, his moral traditionalism, and his demonstration that reform can occur within existing institutions rather than through revolution. Progressives highlight his championing of the oppressed, his use of public advocacy and grassroots mobilization, and his willingness to challenge powerful economic interests. Both sides can find elements in his complex record to support their contemporary agendas, though this often involves selective reading of his full political positions.[^44]

The educational legacy is also significant. Wilberforce's story is widely taught in British and American schools as an example of moral courage and effective advocacy. The Amazing Change film (2006), starring Ioan Gruffudd as Wilberforce, introduced his story to new audiences, though it was criticized by some historians for historical inaccuracies and for overly romanticizing his role. Nonetheless, such popular cultural representations ensure that Wilberforce remains a recognizable historical figure to contemporary audiences.[^45]

Perhaps Wilberforce's most enduring legacy is the demonstration that determined individuals and movements can achieve profound moral change even when confronting powerful opposing interests. His twenty-year campaign against the slave trade, despite repeated defeats and enormous opposition, showed that persistence, strategic thinking, moral clarity, and effective coalition-building could eventually prevail. In an era often characterized by cynicism about political change, Wilberforce's achievement offers evidence that transformative reform is possible, a legacy that continues to inspire activists and reformers worldwide.[^46]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments of Wilberforce have often been highly laudatory, particularly in the British historical tradition. Biographers like Robert Isaac Wilberforce and Samuel Wilberforce (his sons) established early hagiographic accounts that portrayed him as a moral saint and national hero. These Victorian-era biographies emphasized his piety, selflessness, and dedication to humanitarian causes, creating an image of Wilberforce as the embodiment of Christian virtue applied to public life.[^47]

Modern sympathetic historians like William Hague, former British Conservative Party leader, have written appreciative biographies that, while more critical than Victorian accounts, still celebrate Wilberforce's achievements. Hague's 2007 biography argues that Wilberforce deserves credit for his extraordinary parliamentary skill, his ability to build and maintain coalitions across political divides, and his persistence through decades of defeat. Hague portrays Wilberforce as a master strategist whose evangelical faith motivated but did not blind him to political realities.[^48]

Scholars of evangelicalism and religious history often view Wilberforce positively as a pioneering figure in faith-based social reform. John Pollock's influential biography presents Wilberforce as demonstrating how deep religious commitment can translate into effective social action. These scholars note that Wilberforce's "practical Christianity" combined personal piety with public engagement, challenging the stereotype that evangelical Christianity inevitably leads to political quietism or otherworldliness. His example inspired subsequent generations of Christian social reformers, from Lord Shaftesbury in the 19th century to Martin Luther King Jr. in the 20th.[^49]

Abolition historians like Adam Hochschild, while acknowledging that the abolitionist movement was broader than any single individual, credit Wilberforce with essential parliamentary leadership. Hochschild's "Bury the Chains" argues that while Thomas Clarkson and others did crucial groundwork, Wilberforce's political connections, oratorical skill, and social position made him uniquely positioned to champion abolition in Parliament. Without his willingness to take on this role, despite the political costs, the parliamentary campaign might have lacked effective leadership at crucial moments.[^50]

Some scholars emphasize Wilberforce's role in pioneering modern advocacy techniques. The abolitionist campaign used methods—mass petitions, economic boycotts, publicity campaigns, graphic imagery, personal testimony—that became templates for subsequent social movements. While these innovations were collective achievements of the abolitionist movement, Wilberforce's parliamentary platform gave them political effectiveness. His integration of grassroots advocacy with elite political action created a model for democratic reform movements.[^51]

Defenders of Wilberforce's broader legacy argue that his opposition to labor reform should be understood in context. They contend that his evangelical belief in spiritual transformation leading to social change, while paternalistic by modern standards, was sincere and reflected the intellectual frameworks of his time. Moreover, some historians note that Wilberforce did support some social reforms beyond abolition, including restrictions on child labor in chimney sweeping and efforts to improve prison conditions, even if these efforts were less comprehensive than his anti-slavery work.[^52]

Religious conservatives particularly celebrate Wilberforce as demonstrating that traditional Christian morality can be a force for social progress. Organizations like the Wilberforce Forum and writers like Eric Metaxas have presented Wilberforce as a model for contemporary Christian political engagement, arguing that his example shows faith-based activism can achieve major social reforms. These accounts emphasize his personal devotion, his integration of faith and politics, and his demonstration that moral conviction combined with political pragmatism can transform society.[^53]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars have challenged the celebratory Wilberforce narrative on multiple grounds. Historians influenced by social history and postcolonial theory question the "great man" approach that centers elite white men as the agents of change while minimizing structural forces and the agency of oppressed people themselves. C.L.R. James's "The Black Jacobins," while not focused on Wilberforce specifically, argued that the Haitian Revolution and slave resistance, not parliamentary benevolence, were the primary drivers of abolition. This perspective suggests that Wilberforce was responding to historical forces rather than creating them.[^54]

Labor historians like E.P. Thompson have been particularly harsh in their assessments. Thompson's "The Making of the English Working Class" portrays Wilberforce and his evangelical associates as class enemies of working people whose concern for distant enslaved Africans masked indifference or hostility to British workers' suffering. Thompson argues that Wilberforce's moral crusades served to channel reformist energies away from challenging domestic class oppression, functioning as a safety valve for humanitarian sentiment that might otherwise have threatened the British class system.[^55]

Scholars examining race and colonialism have criticized the paternalism inherent in Wilberforce's abolitionism. While he opposed slavery, his vision for formerly enslaved people emphasized their conversion to Christianity and their incorporation into colonial economic systems as laborers. He did not advocate for racial equality in any comprehensive sense, and his support for missionary activity and "civilizing" missions reflected assumptions about European cultural superiority. Some critics see his abolitionism as a form of humanitarian racism that opposed slavery's brutality while maintaining racial hierarchies.[^56]

Recent scholarship has also questioned whether British abolition was primarily motivated by moral concerns or by economic self-interest. Eric Williams's controversial "Capitalism and Slavery" thesis argued that the slave trade and Caribbean slavery were abolished when they became economically obsolete and contrary to industrial capitalism's interests, not primarily for moral reasons. While Williams's economic determinism has been challenged, some historians argue that Wilberforce and other abolitionists succeeded when they aligned moral arguments with shifting economic interests, suggesting that economic factors were more important than traditional narratives acknowledge.[^57]

Black British scholars and activists have sometimes criticized how Wilberforce's legacy has been used to promote a self-congratulatory British narrative about abolition that obscures ongoing racial injustice. The focus on Wilberforce allows Britain to celebrate its role in ending slavery while avoiding reckoning with the enormous profits extracted from slavery and the failure to provide reparations to enslaved people. Critics argue that the Wilberforce myth functions to allow white Britain to feel good about its past while avoiding addressing structural racism in the present.[^58]

Historians of women's history have noted that while women were crucial to the abolitionist movement—organizing boycotts, writing pamphlets, circulating petitions—the celebratory focus on Wilberforce has tended to marginalize their contributions. Women like Hannah More, Elizabeth Heyrick, and Anne Knight were essential activists whose radicalism often exceeded Wilberforce's, particularly on questions of immediate versus gradual emancipation. The focus on parliamentary politics naturally centers men like Wilberforce while obscuring the grassroots activism where women played leading roles.[^59]

Some historians have also criticized Wilberforce's compromises, particularly the apprenticeship system and the compensation to slave owners. Critics argue that a truly radical abolitionism would have insisted on immediate, uncompensated emancipation with land redistribution to formerly enslaved people. Wilberforce's willingness to accept extended timelines and to prioritize slave owners' property rights revealed the limits of his radicalism and his ultimate deference to the existing property system and class structure.[^60]

Additionally, scholars examining religious pluralism have criticized Wilberforce's intolerance toward Catholics, Jews, and non-Christians. His support for discriminatory laws and his missionary zeal reflected a religious exclusivism that contradicted his humanitarian principles. Critics argue that his moral vision, while expansive regarding slavery, was narrow regarding religious and cultural difference, and that his evangelical worldview could be as oppressive as it was liberating, depending on who was the object of his attention.[^61]
