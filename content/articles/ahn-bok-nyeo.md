## Summary

Ahn Bok-nyeo (also known as "Boksun" in testimonies) was born on January 2, 1928, in Seoul's Mapo district, Korea. At age 13 in Fall 1942, she was forcibly abducted by the Japanese military and taken to China, where she endured sexual slavery as a "comfort woman" until Japan's defeat in 1945. She returned to Seoul in 1946 and never married, living alone for the rest of her life. Her testimony stands as one of the critical firsthand accounts documenting the systematic sexual slavery perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces during World War II, a crime that affected an estimated 200,000 women, predominantly from Korea.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Ahn Bok-nyeo was born at the beginning of 1928 in the Mapo district of Seoul, Korea, during a period when Korea was under Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945).[^4] Growing up in Boksagol Street in the Mapo area, she was a young girl in a society suffering under the oppression of Japanese imperialism.[^5] The conditions of Korean life under Japanese colonization were marked by cultural suppression, economic exploitation, and systematic discrimination against the Korean population.[^6]

During this era, poverty, starvation, and suffering drove mass migration of rural young women into urban regions to find work, creating conditions of extreme vulnerability.[^7] Korean families struggled under colonial policies that extracted resources from Korea to support Japan's expanding military campaigns throughout Asia.[^8] Education for Korean girls was limited, and most young women from lower social classes, like Ahn, had little formal schooling and few opportunities for economic advancement.[^9]

The Japanese colonial government maintained strict control over Korean society through a combination of military force, police surveillance, and administrative systems designed to facilitate resource extraction and population control.[^10] By the early 1940s, as Japan's war efforts intensified across the Asia-Pacific region, the Japanese military began systematically recruiting and abducting Korean women and girls for sexual slavery in what became known as the "comfort women" system.[^11]

At thirteen years old in 1942, Ahn was still a child, living in an era when Korean girls had virtually no protection from the predatory recruitment practices of the Japanese military apparatus.[^12] Her youth, her gender, and her Korean nationality made her particularly vulnerable to the trafficking schemes that would soon destroy her childhood.[^13]

## Abduction and Enslavement

In the fall of 1942, when Ahn Bok-nyeo was just thirteen years old, her life was violently torn apart by the Japanese military's systematic abduction campaign.[^14] The abduction occurred in Mapo, her home district in Seoul, where Japanese authorities and their collaborators conducted organized raids to capture young Korean girls for the military sexual slavery system.[^15]

According to her testimony, the head of the neighborhood organization announced over a loudspeaker, asking all unmarried girls of certain ages to meet at a designated location.[^16] This method of deception was commonly employed by Japanese authorities, who would claim they needed girls for work in factories, as nurses, or for other legitimate purposes.[^17] Girls were being weighed on a rice scale one by one, and those who were tall and healthy were being put in a truck.[^18]

The traumatic details of her abduction reveal the systematic and brutal nature of the operation. The truck she was forced into had flaps that were pulled down after loading approximately ten girls from Boksagol Street.[^19] For a period after the truck departed, the terrified girls could hear the sounds of their mothers crying as they desperately followed the vehicle.[^20] Two Japanese soldiers armed with guns guarded the girls in the back of the truck, while another soldier sat in the passenger seat by the driver.[^21]

In her testimony, Ahn recalled: "At that time she was thirteen, an age when you don't know anything—her heart was racing, she was scared, and she had no idea what she should do."[^22] This statement captures the absolute terror and helplessness experienced by a child being kidnapped by armed military forces.

The recruitment methods used to enslave Ahn and countless other Korean girls involved a combination of deception, coercion, and outright violence.[^23] The most common tactic in Korea was deceit, with false promises of employment as factory workers, nurses, laundry workers, or kitchen helpers in Japan or Japanese-occupied territories.[^24] Beginning in 1938, the Japanese military utilized both Japanese and Korean civilian brokers to locate and acquire young women.[^25] Toward the end of the war, the military increasingly used police forces to procure women through direct abduction.[^26]

After her abduction in Seoul, Ahn was transported to China, a journey that typically involved weeks of travel by train, bus, and on foot to reach military installations in Japanese-occupied Chinese territory.[^27] Korean women were trafficked to numerous locations across China, including comfort stations in Shanghai, Yanji, Songshan, Anni, Choan, and Hoking.[^28] In 1942 alone, approximately 800 Korean women were trafficked under false pretenses, ostensibly recruited for work such as visiting wounded soldiers in hospitals or rolling bandages, when in reality they were destined for sexual slavery.[^29]

## Life in the Comfort Stations

The conditions Ahn Bok-nyeo endured in the comfort stations in China represented some of the most brutal violations of human rights documented in the twentieth century. Comfort stations were military-controlled brothels where women and girls were detained and subjected to systematic sexual violence.[^30]

Daily life in these facilities was characterized by extreme deprivation and abuse. Women couldn't even wash their faces every day, and sometimes Japanese soldiers would bring piped water hauled in by truck, which the women would use dishes to scoop out for washing.[^31] The women had minimal clothing, no underwear, and were given one-piece dresses that could be easily removed with only a couple of buttons, designed specifically to facilitate rapid sexual assault.[^32]

The sexual exploitation was relentless and brutal. Women were forced to serve as sex slaves for Japanese soldiers, being raped 10 to 50 times a day for years.[^33] Some testimonies describe women being sexually assaulted by up to 20 soldiers per day.[^34] The frequency of assaults increased dramatically before battles, as military commanders believed sexual access would boost soldiers' morale.[^35]

All victims, including Ahn, experienced severe physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.[^36] They suffered immeasurable pain from sexually transmitted diseases, aggressive and often dangerous medical treatments for these diseases, forced abortions, forced sterilization, starvation, physical beatings, torture, and constant threats of death.[^37] Approximately 75 percent of comfort women are estimated to have died during their captivity.[^38]

Women who became too sick to continue serving soldiers were not given medical treatment but were instead killed.[^39] Those who attempted to escape faced public torture and execution as examples to others.[^40] When comfort women died in the stations, they were not properly buried but were instead abandoned in the street or disposed of without dignity.[^41]

Although official Japanese military policy technically prohibited abuse against comfort women, daily violence by comfort station operators and soldiers was commonplace and went unpunished.[^42] The gap between official policy and actual practice meant that the women had no meaningful protections whatsoever.[^43]

The psychological impact of this sustained trauma was devastating. Comfort women endured extreme trauma involving rape, sexual torture, physical abuse, starvation, threats of death, and witnessed many others being tortured and killed.[^44] Early-life trauma of this severity is reported to have more lasting and pernicious effects over the life course, particularly when experienced during adolescence as Ahn did.[^45]

## Liberation and Return to Korea

The end of World War II brought both liberation and new challenges for comfort women survivors. Japan formally surrendered on September 2, 1945, marking the technical end of the comfort women system.[^46] However, the final months of the war proved particularly dangerous for the enslaved women, as the Japanese military systematically destroyed documents and, in many cases, massacred comfort women to cover up evidence of their crimes.[^47]

Only a small percentage of the original approximately 200,000 comfort women survived to return home. A 1993 United Nations study estimated that only 10% of the women and girls held in comfort stations survived after 1945.[^48] Based on a statement made by Representative Seijuro Arahune of the Japanese Diet in 1975, as many as three-fourths of Korean comfort women may have died during the war.[^49]

Ahn Bok-nyeo was among the fortunate few who survived. She returned to Seoul in 1946, one year after the defeat of Japan and the liberation of Korea.[^50] However, her return did not bring peace or restoration. Instead, she faced a society that was unprepared to support survivors of sexual violence and that operated under strict Confucian values that shamed women who had lost their virginity outside of marriage, regardless of the circumstances.[^51]

In 1945 and 1946, when comfort women returned to Korea, they came back as "hwanghyang nyo"—to the Koreans around them, they were neither faithful nor chaste, and they were not considered exemplary women.[^52] Upon returning, comfort women were often ostracized by family and friends.[^53] In Confucian cultures such as Korea, where premarital sex was considered deeply shameful, the subject of comfort women was ignored for decades after 1945, and the victims were treated as pariahs.[^54]

The social stigma was so severe that Ahn never married and lived constantly alone for the rest of her life.[^55] This pattern was common among survivors. Many committed suicide, drifted away from their families, were unable to have children of their own due to injuries sustained during their enslavement, and worked multiple menial jobs to pay for ongoing medical treatment.[^56]

Post-war Korea provided no support systems, no recognition, and no justice for comfort women survivors. Most suffered life-long physical and mental injuries without any form of compensation or acknowledgment from either the Japanese government or their own government.[^57] Some survivors chose never to return to Korea, remaining in remote areas of China or other locations where they had been abandoned, living in shame and isolation, even losing their mother tongue over the decades.[^58]

After the war ended in 1945, survivors went silent due to an immense sense of shame.[^59] It would take nearly fifty years before comfort women like Ahn would see their experiences acknowledged publicly.[^60]

---

## Breaking the Silence: The 1990s Breakthrough

For decades after World War II, the experiences of comfort women remained hidden, suppressed by social stigma, governmental indifference, and active denial by the Japanese government.[^61] This silence began to crack in the late 1980s and early 1990s as the growth of women's rights movements in South Korea created space for survivors to speak.[^62]

The watershed moment came on August 14, 1991, when Kim Hak-soon became the first woman in Korea to come forward publicly and testify about her experience as a comfort woman for the Japanese military.[^63] Kim was inspired to break over 50 years of silence after hearing news that the Japanese government was denying having recruited comfort women.[^64] She contacted a women's rights group and gave her testimony, becoming the catalyst for hundreds of other survivors to come forward.[^65]

Kim Hak-soon's brave disclosure had immediate and far-reaching effects. After her testimony, other victims of Japanese military sexual slavery from Korea, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Netherlands began to share their ordeals.[^66] The Korean government officially recognized the women as victims of war crimes, and civil society mobilized in support of memorials, reparations, and historical preservation.[^67]

Following Kim's testimony, survivors organized the Wednesday Demonstrations, which began on January 8, 1992, as weekly protests held every Wednesday at noon in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.[^68] These protests, which continue to this day, call on the Japanese government to officially apologize to Korean victims who were coerced to render sexual services to Japanese military personnel before and during World War II.[^69] In March 2002, the Wednesday Demonstrations were listed in the Guinness World Records as the world's oldest rally on a single theme.[^70]

On December 14, 2011, in commemoration of the 1,000th Wednesday Demonstration, the Korean Council installed the Statue of Peace (also known as the Peace Girl Statue) facing the Japanese Embassy in Seoul.[^71] The statue, depicting a young girl sitting on a chair with an empty chair beside her, represents all Korean girls forced into sexual slavery by the Imperial Japanese Army.[^72]

To honor Kim Hak-soon's courageous testimony, August 14 has been designated as International Memorial Day for "Comfort Women."[^73] In 2018, South Korea officially began observing August 14 as National Memorial Day.[^74]

It was during this period of activism and public testimony in the 1990s and early 2000s that Ahn Bok-nyeo's testimony was also documented, contributing to the growing body of evidence about the comfort women system.[^75] Her account, preserved in collections of survivor testimonies, provided crucial details about the abduction methods, the conditions of enslavement, and the long-term impacts on survivors' lives.[^76]

## The Comfort Women Issue and International Recognition

The emergence of comfort women testimonies in the 1990s sparked significant international attention and led to formal recognition of the issue as a major human rights violation and war crime.[^77]

The issue was first raised at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1992, shortly after Kim Hak-soon's groundbreaking testimony.[^78] In 1996, Radhika Coomaraswamy, Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women for the UN Commission on Human Rights, included recommendations addressed to the Japanese government about fulfilling the demands of comfort women in her report.[^79] The McDougal Report of 1998 became the first UN document to recommend punishment of those responsible for the comfort women system.[^80]

However, a major limitation of the post-World War II justice process was that sexual violence against women was not expressly recognized as a war crime during the original Tokyo War Crimes Trials, and the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg did not expressly prosecute sexual violence.[^81] The Tokyo Tribunal completely ignored the Japanese army's enslavement of comfort women.[^82]

To address this gap in justice, a peoples' tribunal called the Women's International War Crimes Tribunal 2000 was convened in Tokyo from December 8-12, 2000.[^83] This tribunal was established to consider the criminal liability of leading high-ranking Japanese military and political officials and the separate responsibility of the state of Japan for rape and sexual slavery as crimes against humanity.[^84] The judges found both the Japanese State and Emperor Hirohito guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity.[^85] However, because the tribunal was established by private citizens rather than by governments or international bodies, the judgment was not legally binding or enforceable.[^86]

International scholarly consensus recognizes the comfort women system as the largest case of government-sponsored human trafficking and sexual slavery in modern history.[^87] Estimates by academic researchers typically point to between 20,000 and 200,000 women victimized, with the majority from Korea, though victims also came from China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Netherlands, and other territories occupied by Japan.[^88]

The emergence of women as subjects of history and the feminist movements of the 1990s formed the necessary background for survivors like Ahn Bok-nyeo to speak out.[^89] Scholars have acknowledged the interaction between feminist movements and left-wing nationalism that transformed the discourse into the language of anti-colonialism, anti-imperialism, and human rights.[^90]

Multiple memorials and statues have been erected worldwide to honor comfort women survivors. The San Francisco Comfort Women Memorial, unveiled on September 22, 2017, features a 10-foot-tall bronze "Column of Strength" statue depicting three teenage girls representing Chinese, Korean, and Philippine victims.[^91] Similar memorials exist in Melbourne, Hong Kong, Manila, Berlin, and other cities with significant Korean and Asian populations.[^92]

## Japan's Response and Ongoing Controversy

Japan's response to the comfort women issue has been characterized by decades of denial, reluctant partial acknowledgments, and ongoing controversy that continues to re-traumatize survivors.[^93]

For nearly five decades after World War II, Japan denied the existence of the comfort women system, refusing to provide an apology or appropriate restitution.[^94] After numerous demands for apologies and the revelation of official records showing the Japanese government's culpability in the early 1990s, the Japanese government began to offer limited official acknowledgments.[^95]

On December 28, 2015, the South Korean and Japanese governments announced an Agreement on Comfort Women through their foreign ministers.[^96] Foreign Minister Kishida stated on behalf of Prime Minister Abe that "the issue of comfort women, with an involvement of the Japanese military authorities at that time, was a grave affront to the honor and dignity of large numbers of women" and that "Prime Minister Abe expresses anew his most sincere apologies and remorse to all the women who underwent immeasurable and painful experiences."[^97] Japan agreed to provide a one-time contribution of one billion yen (approximately US$8.3 million) to carry out joint projects with South Korea.[^98] The governments confirmed that the comfort women issue would be resolved "finally and irreversibly."[^99]

However, the 2015 agreement faced severe criticism from multiple quarters. The South Korean government did not consult with the survivors themselves before negotiating the agreement.[^100] Victims claimed it lacked a genuine apology and was negotiated without their meaningful participation.[^101] Just three weeks after the agreement, Prime Minister Abe told the Japanese National Assembly, "There was no document found that the comfort women were forcibly taken away."[^102] About nine months later, when South Korea asked Abe to send a letter of apology directly to former comfort women, Abe replied, "I have no intention of apologizing again."[^103]

UN human rights experts stated that "the agreement between Japan and South Korea falls short of meeting the demands of survivors" and called for "an unequivocal official apology recognizing the full responsibility of the then Japanese Government and military."[^104] The agreement did not acknowledge violations of human rights law committed by Japan, nor did it accept legal responsibility.[^105]

Public opinion in South Korea was divided but generally critical of the agreement. A poll conducted days after the announcement found that 50.7% of respondents disapproved of the deal.[^106] President Moon Jae-in stated that the Korean people "cannot emotionally accept" the 2015 agreement.[^107]

A significant revisionist movement in Japan has sought to minimize or deny the comfort women issue. Conservative groups characterize the issue as fabricated to inflame diplomatic tensions and present Japan as a victim of false accusations by South Korea and China.[^108] The Society for History Textbook Reform was established in 1996, and Nippon Kaigi (Japan Conference), Japan's largest conservative alliance organization, was founded in 1997 to promote revisionist historical narratives.[^109] In March 2007, Prime Minister Abe made a statement denying the forcible nature of the comfort women system.[^110]

Japanese conservative organizations have argued that the United States is the "main battleground" in the "history war" they are fighting, calling on the Japanese government to more forcefully promote "Japan's side" of the controversy internationally.[^111] They characterize testimonies of comfort women as untrustworthy and accuse Japanese liberal media of fabricating the issue.[^112]

Despite overwhelming testimonial and documentary evidence, Japan has never formally apologized in a manner that satisfies international human rights standards, nor has it provided adequate legal reparations.[^113] Japan still does not formally recognize its legal responsibility for institutionalized sexual slavery during World War II.[^114]

## Personal Life and Lasting Impact

Ahn Bok-nyeo's personal life after her return to Korea in 1946 was profoundly shaped by the trauma she endured and the social stigma she faced as a comfort woman survivor.[^115] She never married and lived constantly alone for the rest of her life.[^116] This isolation was not a choice but a consequence of the shame and ostracism imposed on comfort women by Korean society's strict Confucian values.[^117]

The physical and psychological wounds Ahn carried lasted throughout her life. Survivors of the comfort women system suffered from serious psychological trauma and social stigma in addition to physical injuries, and could not tell their story to anybody for decades.[^118] When the war ended, survived victims had to go on with their lives enduring incurable physical and psychological wounds.[^119]

Research on comfort women survivors has documented extraordinarily high rates of mental health disorders. All participants in one comprehensive study had suffered from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder at least once in their lives, and 30.8% were diagnosed with PTSD at the time of evaluation decades after liberation.[^120] Survivors showed high current and lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder, somatic symptom disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and alcohol use disorder.[^121]

The PTSD symptom profiles of former comfort women were characterized by avoidance, recollection, and anger.[^122] Survivors had impairments in anger control and were more depressed than control groups.[^123] The trauma of Japanese military sexual slavery affected the mental health and social functioning of survivors throughout their lives, extending even to the present day for those still living.[^124]

Ahn and other survivors were continuously re-traumatized by the unsettled controversy regarding the comfort women issue, Japan's persistent denial and refusal to provide adequate apology and compensation, and the ongoing debates about the historical facts of their experiences.[^125] This ongoing re-traumatization prevented many survivors from achieving any form of closure or healing.[^126]

## Legacy and Historical Significance

Ahn Bok-nyeo's testimony and the testimonies of other comfort women survivors have become crucial historical documents that expose one of the twentieth century's most systematic campaigns of sexual violence and slavery.[^127] Her story represents not just individual suffering but the experiences of approximately 200,000 women and girls subjected to the Japanese military's comfort women system.[^128]

The collective testimonies of comfort women survivors led to fundamental shifts in how international law and human rights frameworks address conflict-related sexual violence.[^129] The comfort women issue helped establish sexual slavery and systematic rape as recognized crimes against humanity and war crimes in international jurisprudence.[^130]

The legacy of comfort women activism has inspired movements addressing sexual violence in conflicts worldwide, from Bosnia to Rwanda to Syria.[^131] The Wednesday Demonstrations that began in 1992 continue to this day, representing over three decades of sustained advocacy and one of the longest-running protest movements in global history.[^132]

The War and Women's Human Rights Museum, which opened in Seoul on May 5, 2012, preserves the testimonies and artifacts of comfort women survivors.[^133] Built in a renovated home on the foothills of Mt. Seongmi in Mapo district—Ahn Bok-nyeo's home area—the museum serves as a space dedicated to remembering and educating about the history of comfort women victim-survivors.[^134] The museum's black bricks symbolize an epitaph of the tragic history of the grandmothers who survived or passed away.[^135]

The Statue of Peace, first erected in Seoul and subsequently replicated in cities worldwide, has become an iconic symbol of the fight for justice and acknowledgment.[^136] These statues serve to keep the issue alive as the number of living survivors continues to dwindle.[^137]

As of 2025, the number of surviving comfort women has decreased dramatically. In February 2025, the death of Gil Won-ok left just six surviving victims in South Korea.[^138] In May 2025, a 96-year-old survivor passed away in central China's Hunan Province, leaving only seven registered survivors on the Chinese mainland.[^139] The approaching loss of all living survivors makes the preservation of testimonies like Ahn's increasingly critical.[^140]

Despite the overwhelming number of testimonies and historical evidence, no acceptable apology or adequate legal reparations have been offered by the Japanese government.[^141] The survivors' message has remained unchanged since the first public testimony in 1991: the past may be fading, but the fight for justice is far from over.[^142]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars, human rights advocates, and feminist movements worldwide have recognized comfort women survivors like Ahn Bok-nyeo as courageous witnesses whose testimonies exposed one of history's most systematic and brutal campaigns of sexual violence.[^143] The bravery required for survivors to break decades of silence in the face of intense social stigma has been widely praised by international human rights organizations.[^144]

Academic researchers have validated the testimonies of comfort women through extensive documentation, including military records, survivor accounts, and photographic evidence.[^145] Leading historians of Asian history and World War II recognize the comfort women system as unequivocally constituting sexual slavery and crimes against humanity.[^146] The work of scholars like Yoshimi Yoshiaki, who uncovered documentary evidence in Japanese archives proving military involvement in establishing and operating comfort stations, has been instrumental in establishing historical truth.[^147]

Feminist scholars have highlighted how the comfort women movement transformed international discourse on wartime sexual violence, shifting it from a taboo subject to a recognized human rights issue.[^148] The movement's strategies, which employed the language of human rights in their struggle, have been studied as models for other survivors' movements globally.[^149]

UN human rights mechanisms have consistently supported comfort women survivors' demands for justice. Multiple UN Special Rapporteurs have called on Japan to provide formal apologies, accept legal responsibility, and provide adequate reparations.[^150] The international human rights community views the comfort women issue as a test case for accountability for state-sponsored sexual violence.[^151]

The comfort women survivors have been recognized for educating younger generations about the dangers of militarism, colonialism, and the specific vulnerabilities women face during armed conflicts.[^152] Their advocacy has contributed to the development of international legal frameworks that now recognize sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, and rape as war crimes and crimes against humanity in instruments like the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.[^153]

Museums, memorials, and educational programs worldwide honor comfort women survivors as defenders of human dignity who refused to let their suffering be forgotten or denied.[^154] The Peace Statue and other memorials serve not just as remembrances of past atrocities but as ongoing calls for justice and prevention of future violations.[^155]

### Negative Views and Criticism

A revisionist movement, primarily centered in Japan but with some international reach, has challenged the testimonies of comfort women survivors and sought to minimize or deny the systematic nature of Japanese military sexual slavery.[^156] Conservative Japanese historians and political figures have argued that comfort women were voluntary prostitutes rather than enslaved victims, characterizing testimonies as unreliable or fabricated.[^157]

Organizations like Nippon Kaigi (Japan Conference) and the Society for History Textbook Reform have promoted narratives that frame Japan as a victim of false accusations designed to damage its international reputation.[^158] These groups characterize the comfort women issue as fabricated by Korean and Chinese activists to inflame diplomatic tensions.[^159]

Some revisionist scholars, such as Ikuhiko Hata, have claimed that "none of the comfort women were forcibly recruited," arguing that recruitment was conducted through private brokers and that coercion by military authorities did not occur.[^160] These arguments focus narrowly on whether direct military abduction occurred while ignoring the broader context of coercion, deception, and the power dynamics of military occupation.[^161]

The Global Alliance for Historical Truth (GAHT), a non-profit organization with directors who hold prominent positions in Nippon Kaigi, has mounted campaigns in the United States and other countries to oppose comfort women memorials and to promote what they characterize as "Japan's side" of the controversy.[^162] These groups have called the United States the "main battleground" in their "history war."[^163]

Japanese conservative politicians, including former Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, have made statements undermining official apologies. In March 2007, Abe stated his denial of the forcible nature of the comfort women system.[^164] Even after the 2015 agreement, Abe told the Japanese National Assembly that "there was no document found that the comfort women were forcibly taken away," effectively contradicting the spirit of the agreement.[^165]

Critics of the comfort women movement have also emerged from unexpected quarters. Some conservative Koreans have argued that continued focus on the issue damages Korea-Japan relations and prevents forward-looking cooperation.[^166] There have been controversies about the management of funds designated for survivors and about whether some activist organizations adequately centered survivors' voices in their advocacy.[^167]

However, the overwhelming majority of serious historical scholarship, international legal opinion, and human rights assessment supports the testimonies of survivors and recognizes the comfort women system as a clear case of systematic sexual slavery and crimes against humanity.[^168] The revisionist position has been thoroughly rejected by mainstream historical scholarship and international human rights bodies.[^169]
