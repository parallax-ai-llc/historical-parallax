## Summary

Inge Lehmann was a Danish seismologist and geophysicist who discovered that Earth has a solid inner core distinct from the liquid outer core. In 1936, she analyzed seismic wave data that could not be explained by existing models and proposed the existence of a solid inner core. Her discovery fundamentally changed our understanding of Earth's interior structure. She lived to be 104 years old.
