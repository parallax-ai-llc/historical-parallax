## Summary

Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II (c. 1854 – January 28, 1874), also known as Sultan Mahmud Riayat Shah, was the thirty-fourth sultan of the Aceh Sultanate in northern Sumatra, reigning from 1870 to 1874.[^1][^2] As the last sultan to rule independent Aceh before Dutch colonial invasion, his brief reign was marked by diplomatic struggles, international tensions, and ultimately the outbreak of the Aceh War in 1873.[^3] Despite his youth and inexperience, he attempted to preserve Acehnese sovereignty through diplomatic appeals to the Ottoman Empire and resistance against Dutch ultimatums.[^4] He died of cholera during the second Dutch expedition at the age of approximately twenty, becoming a symbol of Acehnese resistance against colonialism.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II was born around 1854 as the son of Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Ali Iskandar Syah (died 1857) and a commoner wife.[^6][^7] His father, the thirty-second sultan of Aceh, had a largely nominal reign from 1838 to 1857, as his forceful uncle Ibrahim acted as regent during his minority.[^8] The young Mahmud Syah grew up during a turbulent period in Acehnese history, marked by civil conflict between rival factions of the royal family.

His father's reign ended in 1857 during a civil war that broke out in 1854 between Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Ali Iskandar Syah and his uncle, the acting sultan Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah.[^9] Following his father's death, Mahmud Syah's early life remained largely obscure until his unexpected ascension to the throne. He was raised within the context of the Bugis Dynasty of Aceh, which had ruled the sultanate since 1727 when Sultan Ala ad-din Ahmad Shah, a member of the Buginese dynasty, took power.[^10][^11]

The Aceh Sultanate during this period was a major regional power that had maintained its independence through the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, which guaranteed Aceh's sovereignty against Dutch expansion.[^12] The sultanate's capital was Kutaraja (present-day Banda Aceh), and it controlled strategic trade routes through the Straits of Malacca.[^13] Young Mahmud Syah received education befitting a potential royal heir, with particular emphasis on Islamic scholarship and statecraft. His primary tutor was the influential Hadhrami scholar Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir, whom he greatly admired and who would later become his guardian and chief advisor.[^14]

The geopolitical landscape of his youth was increasingly precarious. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 made the Straits of Malacca one of the world's most strategically important sea routes, intensifying Dutch interest in controlling all of Sumatra, including independent Aceh.[^15] This international pressure would define the brief reign that awaited the young prince.

## Rise to Power

The succession crisis of 1870 thrust the teenage Mahmud Syah onto the throne during one of the most dangerous periods in Acehnese history. When his grand-uncle Sultan Alauddin Ibrahim Mansur Syah died in 1870 without living sons, the succession became complicated.[^16] Both of Ibrahim Mansur Syah's sons, Tuanku Husain and Tuanku Zainul Abidin, had already died in 1869 and 1870 respectively, leaving no direct heirs from that line.[^17]

In this succession vacuum, Alauddin Mahmud Syah II, though still a minor at approximately sixteen years of age, was selected by the Acehnese elite to become sultan.[^18] His ascension represented a return to his father's line after years of rule by his grand-uncle. However, his youth and inexperience meant that actual governance would be heavily influenced by a council of advisors, particularly Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir, who was formally appointed as his guardian, and Panglima Tibang, a powerful military chief.[^19]

The young sultan's accession occurred at a moment of mounting international crisis. Behind closed doors, Britain and the Netherlands were negotiating the fate of Aceh without any consultation with the sultanate. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty, signed on November 2, 1871, became known as the Sumatra Treaty, and it fundamentally altered the regional balance of power.[^20] In exchange for Dutch possessions on the Gold Coast of West Africa and certain commercial benefits, Britain abandoned its earlier protection of Acehnese independence and granted the Netherlands a free hand in northern Sumatra.[^21]

This diplomatic betrayal, conducted entirely over the head of the Acehnese sultan who was not consulted, transformed Aceh's international position from guaranteed independence to extreme vulnerability.[^22] The young Sultan Mahmud Syah II found himself ruling a sovereign state whose sovereignty was no longer recognized by the major European powers. The Dutch Governor-General in Batavia, James Loudon, began making preparations for military action, viewing the 1871 treaty as authorization to force Aceh into submission.[^23]

The sultan's court became divided on how to respond to this existential threat. Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir, the sultan's guardian, recognized that Aceh could not remain isolated from world affairs and favored seeking an understanding with the Dutch colonial state to preserve some degree of autonomy.[^24] In contrast, Panglima Tibang was averse to any compromise with Aceh's independent position and advocated for absolute resistance.[^25] This division would weaken the sultanate's ability to present a unified response to Dutch pressure during the critical period ahead.

## Major Achievements

Despite his youth and the brevity of his reign, Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II pursued several significant diplomatic initiatives in his attempt to preserve Acehnese independence against overwhelming Dutch colonial pressure.

### Diplomatic Outreach to the Ottoman Empire

The sultan's most notable achievement was his attempt to revive historical ties with the Ottoman Empire and secure international support against Dutch aggression. Recognizing that the traditional European powers had abandoned Aceh through the Sumatra Treaty of 1871, Sultan Mahmud Syah commissioned Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir to seek political and potentially military support from the Ottoman Sultan, who was still revered by the Acehnese as the Caliph and "Lord of the Faithful."[^26]

This diplomatic mission represented a sophisticated understanding of international Islamic solidarity and an attempt to leverage Aceh's identity as a Muslim sultanate to gain protection from another Muslim power. Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir, along with Nyak Abbas, departed for the Ottoman capital in late 1872.[^27] The delegation sought to have Aceh declared a protectorate of the Ottoman Empire, which would theoretically deter Dutch aggression by invoking the protection of a major world power.[^28]

The mission demonstrated the sultan's awareness that Aceh's survival required international recognition and support. Historical relations between Aceh and the Ottoman Empire dated back to the sixteenth century, and the sultan's attempt to revive these ties showed diplomatic creativity in seeking non-European allies.[^29]

### Resistance to Dutch Ultimatums

In early 1873, Dutch Governor-General James Loudon decided that military action was necessary and embraced an aggressive policy toward Aceh.[^30] Rumors of American and Italian diplomatic contacts with Aceh, partly resulting from Panglima Tibang's secret negotiations with consuls in Singapore, alarmed Dutch authorities and accelerated their military planning.[^31]

On March 8, 1873, the Dutch official J.F.N. Nieuwenhuyzen was dispatched to Aceh to deliver an ultimatum demanding that the sultan acknowledge Dutch supremacy.[^32] The young sultan, advised by his divided council, provided an evasive reply rather than immediately submitting to Dutch demands.[^33] This response, while perhaps inevitable given the circumstances, showed the sultan's determination not to voluntarily surrender Acehnese sovereignty.

When the Dutch declared war on March 26, 1873, Sultan Mahmud Syah II mobilized Acehnese military forces to defend the capital.[^34] The First Aceh Expedition under Dutch Major General Johan Harmen Rudolf Köhler landed at Panté Ceureumèn on April 6, 1873, with 3,000 troops and reached the capital's Baiturrahman Grand Mosque by April 10.[^35]

### Military Defense and First Dutch Defeat

The young sultan's forces achieved a remarkable initial victory against the technologically superior Dutch forces. When the Dutch attacked the Kraton (royal palace) and the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque, Acehnese fighters defended fiercely.[^36] On April 14, 1873, General Köhler himself was killed by an Acehnese sniper near the mosque.[^37] Having underestimated their Acehnese opposition, the Dutch expedition suffered 45 men killed (including 8 officers) and 405 wounded.[^38]

This defeat of the first Dutch expedition represented a significant achievement for the young sultan and demonstrated that Aceh would not capitulate easily to colonial conquest. The Dutch were forced to withdraw to Java in April 1873, their expedition having utterly failed.[^39] This victory resonated throughout Southeast Asia and temporarily validated the sultan's policy of armed resistance.

### Symbolic Leadership During Crisis

Even as military pressures mounted, Sultan Mahmud Syah II maintained his symbolic role as the legitimate sovereign of Aceh and the focal point of Acehnese resistance. His refusal to flee the capital until the final days of the second Dutch expedition maintained morale among defenders and legitimized the armed struggle against colonial invasion.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II's brief reign was marked by significant failures and controversies that have been subjects of historical criticism, though many resulted from circumstances largely beyond his control.

### Youth and Inexperience

The most fundamental criticism of Sultan Mahmud Syah II was his extreme youth and consequent lack of experience during the most critical period in Acehnese history. When enthroned in 1870, he was still a minor, approximately sixteen years old.[^40] Ascending to the throne during an existential crisis required mature judgment, diplomatic skill, and military experience—qualities impossible for a teenager to possess fully.

This inexperience meant that actual governance was conducted by others, particularly his guardian Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir and the military chief Panglima Tibang. Critics have argued that the Acehnese elite made a catastrophic error in selecting such a young and untested ruler at such a dangerous moment, rather than choosing a more experienced prince or military leader who might have provided stronger leadership.[^41]

### Divided Government and Failed Leadership

The sultan's inability to unify his advisors represented a critical failure of leadership. His two main councilors, Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir and Panglima Tibang, held fundamentally opposed views on how to respond to Dutch pressure.[^42] Habib Abdurrahman favored diplomatic accommodation and understanding with the Dutch, recognizing Aceh's military limitations. Panglima Tibang advocated for absolute resistance and secretly pursued alternative diplomatic channels without coordinating with the sultan or his guardian.[^43]

This division paralyzed effective decision-making and presented the Dutch with mixed signals about Acehnese intentions. When Dutch officer Krayenhoff visited Aceh in May 1872 in an unofficial capacity, he was not allowed to meet the sultan because Habib Abdurrahman was away—a diplomatic protocol failure that missed a potential opportunity for dialogue.[^44] The sultan's inability to control Panglima Tibang's unauthorized negotiations with foreign consuls in Singapore created the very alarm among Dutch authorities that precipitated their decision to invade.[^45]

### Ineffective Diplomatic Initiatives

While the Ottoman diplomatic mission demonstrated creativity, it ultimately failed completely. When Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir reached Istanbul, the first Dutch aggression had already occurred in March 1873.[^46] The Ottoman Empire, facing internal challenges and pressure from European powers, responded ambivalently to the Acehnese request.[^47]

Ottoman statesmen were torn between the potential benefits of pan-Islamic solidarity and the perils of antagonizing Western colonial powers in Southeast Asia.[^48] European powers, particularly the Dutch with support from Russia, France, Germany, and England, successfully pressured the Ottoman Sultan not to intervene directly in Aceh.[^49] The Turkish government asked Habib Abdurrahman to leave Turkey immediately in December 1873, providing only a symbolic second-class "Osmanie" award and a diplomatic letter explaining Turkey's inability to help militarily.[^50]

Critics have argued that the sultan's reliance on Ottoman support was naive and unrealistic, wasting precious time and resources that could have been used to prepare more effective military defenses or pursue more practical diplomatic alternatives.

### Military Unpreparedness and Collapse

Despite the initial victory against General Köhler's expedition, the Acehnese military was ultimately unprepared for sustained conflict with a determined colonial power. When the much larger second Dutch expedition under Lieutenant General Jan van Swieten arrived in December 1873 with 8,500 troops, 4,300 servants and coolies, and another 1,500 troops in reserve, the Acehnese defenses collapsed relatively quickly.[^51]

The Dutch, having learned from their first failure, deployed overwhelming force. The capital's defenses were systematically broken down, with the Baiturrahman Grand Mosque recaptured on January 6, 1874.[^52] The sultan's palace was occupied on January 24, 1874, after the defenders deserted it, representing a catastrophic failure of military leadership and organization.[^53]

Critics have questioned whether the sultan's advisors adequately prepared for the inevitable second Dutch assault or whether more effective defensive strategies could have prolonged Aceh's resistance. The relatively rapid fall of the capital suggested insufficient military planning and preparation.

### Abandonment of the Capital and Death

Sultan Mahmud Syah II was evacuated from the capital on January 15, 1874, and brought to Lueng Bata while sick with cholera.[^54] Some historians have criticized this evacuation as abandoning the capital and the defenders still fighting there. However, the sultan's illness and deteriorating military situation left few alternatives. He died at Lueng Bata on January 28, 1874, at approximately twenty years of age.[^55]

His death from disease rather than in battle, while tragic and likely inevitable given the cholera epidemic sweeping through both armies, deprived the Acehnese resistance of a martyred leader who died fighting, which might have provided more powerful symbolic inspiration for continued resistance.[^56]

## Personal Life

Historical records provide limited information about Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II's personal life, reflecting both his youth and the brief duration of his reign. What emerges from available sources is a portrait of a pious young ruler who relied heavily on his advisors and struggled with the enormous responsibilities thrust upon him.

### Family and Relationships

Sultan Mahmud Syah II was born to Sultan Alauddin Sulaiman Ali Iskandar Syah and a commoner wife, which distinguished him from princes born to royal mothers.[^57] This maternal lineage may have initially placed him lower in the succession hierarchy, contributing to his unexpected ascension only after multiple senior princes had died.

No historical records indicate that the young sultan married or had children during his brief reign from 1870 to 1874. Given that he ascended the throne as a minor and died at approximately age twenty, this is unsurprising. Traditional Acehnese royal marriages typically occurred after a prince reached full maturity and established himself as ruler.

### Personality and Character

Contemporary accounts describe Sultan Mahmud Syah II as deeply pious, cautious, and heavily dependent on his advisors, particularly his guardian and tutor Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir.[^58] The strong bond between the young sultan and his scholarly guardian suggests a relationship that combined educational mentorship with personal affection and trust.

The sultan's character appears to have been shaped by Islamic scholarship and devotion. His willingness to reach out to the Ottoman Caliph reflected both political calculation and genuine religious conviction about Islamic unity. The Acehnese sultanate had long identified itself as a defender of Islamic orthodoxy in Southeast Asia, and Sultan Mahmud Syah II embodied this tradition despite his youth.

### Daily Life and Governance

As a young ruler, Sultan Mahmud Syah II's daily life would have been structured around royal court protocols, religious obligations, and consultations with his advisory council. The division between his two chief advisors—Habib Abdurrahman and Panglima Tibang—likely created considerable personal stress as the young sultan attempted to balance competing recommendations about how to respond to Dutch threats.

Historical sources suggest he was earnest in his desire to preserve Acehnese independence but lacked the experience and forceful personality to impose unity on his divided court. This created a situation where he was sultan in title but not fully in command of his government's direction.

### Health and Final Days

The cholera epidemic that swept through Aceh during the Dutch invasion of 1873-1874 killed thousands on both sides, with the Dutch losing 150 men every month while besieged in Banda Aceh.[^59] Sultan Mahmud Syah II contracted cholera during this epidemic, likely in early January 1874 as the military situation deteriorated.

By January 15, 1874, his condition had become serious enough that his retainers evacuated him from the capital to Lueng Bata, a location outside the immediate battle zone.[^60] For the next thirteen days, the young sultan fought the disease while receiving reports of his capital's fall. He died on January 28, 1874, with his guardian and loyal advisors presumably at his side, though specific details of his final hours have not been preserved in historical records.[^61]

His death marked not only a personal tragedy but also a symbolic moment—the last sultan to rule independent Aceh died as Dutch colonial forces occupied his capital, representing the end of centuries of Acehnese sovereignty.

## Legacy

Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II's legacy is complex and multifaceted, representing both the tragic end of Acehnese independence and the beginning of a legendary resistance that would inspire Indonesian nationalism for generations.

### Symbol of Resistance Against Colonialism

Despite his brief reign and ultimate military defeat, Sultan Mahmud Syah II became a symbol of Acehnese determination to resist foreign domination. His refusal to submit to Dutch ultimatums and his mobilization of forces that defeated the first Dutch expedition demonstrated that colonial conquest would not be achieved easily or without cost.[^62]

The young sultan's death during the struggle against colonialism, rather than through surrender or capitulation, preserved his historical reputation. He became emblematic of Acehnese willingness to sacrifice everything, including the lives of their rulers, rather than accept foreign domination. This symbolism proved powerful in subsequent Acehnese resistance movements and Indonesian nationalist narratives.

### Catalyst for Prolonged Resistance

Although Sultan Mahmud Syah II died in January 1874 and the Dutch occupied the capital, his death did not end Acehnese resistance. On March 4, 1875, the Acehnese elite proclaimed a new sultan, the young Alauddin Muhammad Da'ud Syah II, who would symbolize resistance against colonial rule until 1903.[^63][^64] The continuation of the sultanate, inspired by Mahmud Syah II's refusal to surrender, meant that the Aceh War would last for decades rather than ending with the fall of the capital.

The war Sultan Mahmud Syah II initiated would keep the Dutch colonial army engaged for over thirty years, from 1873 to 1904, with sporadic resistance continuing even longer.[^65] During this extended conflict, 50,000 to 60,000 Acehnese died from violence and disease, approximately 2,000 European and allied indigenous soldiers were killed in combat, and more than 35,000 soldiers and laborers died from disease.[^66] This enormous cost to the Dutch colonial enterprise vindicated the sultan's decision to resist rather than submit.

### Foundation for Future Indonesian Nationalism

The Aceh War and Sultan Mahmud Syah II's role in initiating it left a lasting legacy that shaped Indonesian national identity. Resistance leaders who emerged during and after his death—including Teuku Umar, Cut Nyak Dhien, and Teuku Chik di Tiro—became powerful sources of national pride and inspired future Indonesian nationalists in their struggle for independence against the Dutch.[^67]

These heroes inflicted heavy casualties and significant losses on the Dutch through guerrilla warfare that continued for decades after Sultan Mahmud Syah II's death. Cut Nyak Dhien led resistance for 25 years following her husband Teuku Umar's death in 1899, and both were later awarded the title of National Hero of Indonesia.[^68][^69] Their struggle built directly upon the foundation of resistance that Sultan Mahmud Syah II established by refusing Dutch demands in 1873.

### Aceh's Distinct Identity

The sultan's reign and the subsequent Aceh War reinforced Acehnese identity as distinct within the Indonesian archipelago. For many centuries, Aceh had been a very distinct and influential political entity, with the Sultan of Aceh being a major controller of trade through the Straits of Malacca.[^70] The long and bloody resistance against Dutch colonialism that began under Sultan Mahmud Syah II strengthened this distinct identity and sense of Acehnese exceptionalism.

This legacy continued into modern Indonesian history. Aceh's history of political independence and resistance to control by outsiders persisted after Indonesian independence, with resistance to Jakarta beginning as early as 1953.[^71] In 1976, the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka, or GAM) was founded as an armed resistance group that explicitly cast the defunct Aceh Sultanate as a legitimate sovereign state and positioned itself as the successor to Sultan Mahmud Syah II's independent Aceh.[^72]

GAM propaganda emphasized the sultanate's past relations with European states and the Ottoman Empire—relationships that Sultan Mahmud Syah II had attempted to leverage during his reign. The GAM insurgency lasted from 1976 to 2005, with over 15,000 people killed before a peace agreement granted Aceh broad autonomy in August 2005.[^73] This modern conflict demonstrated how Sultan Mahmud Syah II's legacy of resistance against external control continued to shape Acehnese political consciousness more than a century after his death.

### Historical Commemoration

In modern Indonesia, Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II is remembered as the last sultan to rule independent Aceh and the leader who initiated the heroic resistance against Dutch colonialism. While he may not be as widely celebrated as some of the guerrilla leaders who continued the struggle after his death, his historical importance is recognized in scholarly works on Indonesian colonial history and Acehnese regional identity.

The Baiturrahman Grand Mosque, which was defended during Sultan Mahmud Syah II's reign and burned during the Dutch attack in April 1873, was rebuilt by the Dutch in 1879-1881 as a gesture of reconciliation.[^74] Today, it stands as a monument to Acehnese resilience and a physical reminder of the conflict that began during the young sultan's reign.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many historians and scholars have developed sympathetic assessments of Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II, emphasizing the extraordinary circumstances of his brief reign and recognizing his courage in the face of overwhelming odds.

#### Defenders of His Resistance

Scholars specializing in Southeast Asian anti-colonial movements view Sultan Mahmud Syah II as a legitimate resistance leader who refused to capitulate to European imperialism. His rejection of Dutch ultimatums in March 1873, despite knowing it would trigger war, demonstrated moral courage and commitment to Acehnese sovereignty.[^75] These historians argue that submission would have meant the immediate end of Acehnese independence anyway, so armed resistance represented the only honorable choice available.

The defeat of General Köhler's first expedition in April 1873, resulting in the general's death and the withdrawal of Dutch forces, proved that Acehnese resistance under the young sultan's leadership was not futile.[^76] This initial success inflicted a humiliating defeat on a major European colonial power and demonstrated that indigenous Southeast Asian states could effectively resist technologically superior invaders, at least temporarily. This victory resonated throughout the region and inspired other anti-colonial movements.

#### Victim of Circumstances Beyond His Control

Many historians emphasize that Sultan Mahmud Syah II inherited an impossible situation created by European great power politics over which he had no influence. The Sumatra Treaty of 1871, negotiated between Britain and the Netherlands without any Acehnese consultation, destroyed the international legal framework that had protected Aceh since 1824.[^77] The young sultan cannot be blamed for diplomatic and strategic realities established before his accession and entirely beyond his control.

Scholars note that even the most experienced and capable ruler would have struggled to preserve Acehnese independence against the determined colonial ambitions of the Netherlands backed by British acquiescence. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 made control of the Straits of Malacca strategically crucial to European powers, creating geopolitical pressures that no small Southeast Asian sultanate could resist indefinitely.[^78]

#### Symbol of Anti-Colonial Struggle

Indonesian historians and those writing from post-colonial perspectives celebrate Sultan Mahmud Syah II as representing the beginning of one of Southeast Asia's most determined anti-colonial struggles. The Aceh War that he initiated lasted over thirty years and cost the Dutch colonial empire tremendous resources, casualties, and moral credibility.[^79] The sultanate's resistance demonstrated that colonialism would not be achieved easily or without significant cost, contributing to the broader narrative of Southeast Asian resistance that eventually led to decolonization.

The sultan's attempt to seek Ottoman support demonstrated sophisticated diplomatic thinking about Islamic solidarity and international alliances beyond the European state system.[^80] While ultimately unsuccessful due to Ottoman caution and European pressure, this initiative showed creative strategic thinking about how a small Muslim state might resist European colonialism by appealing to the broader Islamic world—a strategy that would be attempted by other anti-colonial movements in subsequent decades.

#### Foundation for National Heroes

Historians note that Sultan Mahmud Syah II's decision to resist created the conditions for legendary resistance figures like Teuku Umar and Cut Nyak Dhien to emerge. These individuals, now celebrated as National Heroes of Indonesia, built upon the foundation of armed resistance that the sultan established.[^81] Without his initial decision to fight rather than surrender, the prolonged guerrilla warfare that became the Aceh War's defining characteristic might never have developed, and Indonesian nationalism would have lost powerful symbolic figures.

### Negative Views

Other historians and critics have developed more skeptical assessments of Sultan Alauddin Mahmud Syah II, emphasizing his leadership failures and questioning whether his policies served Acehnese interests.

#### Failure of Leadership

Critical historians emphasize that the sultan's youth and inexperience represented a catastrophic leadership failure at a critical moment. The Acehnese elite's decision to place a teenage minor on the throne during an existential crisis showed poor judgment.[^82] An experienced military leader or elder statesman might have provided the strong, unified leadership necessary to either negotiate better terms with the Dutch or organize more effective military resistance.

The division between his advisors Habib Abdurrahman Az-Zahir and Panglima Tibang paralyzed decision-making and sent contradictory signals to the Dutch about Acehnese intentions.[^83] A stronger leader would have imposed discipline on his council and presented a unified policy. Instead, the sultan's inability to control his advisors led to confused diplomacy that likely accelerated Dutch military action.

#### Naive and Ineffective Diplomacy

Critics argue that Sultan Mahmud Syah II's diplomatic initiatives were poorly conceived and wastefully executed. The Ottoman diplomatic mission consumed precious time and resources while offering no realistic prospect of success.[^84] By 1872-1873, the Ottoman Empire was in decline, facing internal challenges and European pressure. The idea that the Ottoman Sultan would militarily confront multiple European powers to defend a distant Southeast Asian sultanate was unrealistic.

These historians contend that more practical diplomatic efforts—such as seeking mediation through neutral European powers, offering limited compromises to delay Dutch action, or forming regional alliances with other Indonesian states—might have been more effective than the quixotic appeal to Istanbul. The sultan's advisors should have recognized the Ottoman Empire's limitations and pursued more achievable diplomatic objectives.

#### Inadequate Military Preparation

While the defeat of General Köhler's first expedition was impressive, critics note that the second Dutch expedition overwhelmed Acehnese defenses relatively quickly. The capital fell within weeks of the second expedition's landing in December 1873, with the palace occupied by January 24, 1874.[^85] This rapid collapse suggests inadequate military preparation and poor defensive planning.

Critical historians argue that the period between the first expedition's defeat in April 1873 and the second expedition's arrival in December 1873 provided eight months for strengthening defenses, training troops, and preparing for the inevitable Dutch return. The relatively quick fall of the capital indicates that this preparation was insufficient, representing a failure of military leadership for which the sultan and his advisors must bear responsibility.

#### Questionable Decision to Fight

Some historians have questioned whether armed resistance served Acehnese interests better than negotiated submission. The Aceh War ultimately resulted in 50,000 to 60,000 Acehnese deaths, massive destruction of infrastructure, and the complete loss of independence anyway.[^86] From this perspective, Sultan Mahmud Syah II's rejection of Dutch ultimatums, while symbolically defiant, led to a humanitarian catastrophe.

These critics argue that accepting Dutch suzerainty in 1873 while negotiating for internal autonomy—similar to arrangements other Indonesian sultanates made—might have preserved more Acehnese lives, infrastructure, and cultural institutions. The decades of warfare devastated Acehnese society in ways that negotiated submission might have avoided, even if the loss of full sovereignty was inevitable given the geopolitical realities of the era.

#### Dutch Historical Perspectives

Dutch colonial historians traditionally viewed Sultan Mahmud Syah II as an obstacle to the Netherlands' legitimate imperial expansion and modernization of backward regions. From this perspective, his refusal to accept Dutch authority was irrational and led to unnecessary bloodshed.[^87] However, these colonial-era interpretations have been largely discredited by post-colonial scholarship that recognizes the legitimacy of indigenous resistance to European imperialism.

Modern Dutch historians have developed more nuanced views, acknowledging the moral ambiguity of colonial conquest while still sometimes criticizing the sultan's specific tactical and strategic decisions as poorly executed resistance rather than questioning the legitimacy of resistance itself.
