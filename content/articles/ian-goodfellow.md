## Summary

Ian Goodfellow invented generative adversarial networks (GANs) in 2014, a breakthrough in AI that uses two neural networks competing against each other to generate realistic synthetic data. GANs revolutionized image generation, style transfer, and data augmentation, and are fundamental to modern AI-generated imagery. He has worked at Google, Apple, and DeepMind.
