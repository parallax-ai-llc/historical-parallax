## Summary

The Washington D.C. UFO incident (also known as the **"Invasion of Washington"**) is one of the most critical events in UFO history because it occurred directly over the nation's capital, causing panic in the highest levels of the U.S. government. For two consecutive weekends in July 1952, strange objects were tracked on radar at National Airport and Andrews Air Force Base, while simultaneously being seen visually by pilots and ground controllers.

The objects flew over the White House and the Capitol Building (a prohibited airspace: P-56). Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept, but the objects outran them. The event was so serious that **President Harry Truman** personally demanded answers, leading to the largest Pentagon press conference since WWII to calm the public.[^1]

## The Incidents

### Weekend 1: July 19-20, 1952
At 11:40 PM, air traffic controller **Edward Nugent** at National Airport noticed seven blips on his radar screen in an unauthorized area.
*   **Speed:** The objects moved at 100-130 mph, then suddenly accelerated to "fantastic speeds" instantly.
*   **Visuals:** Controllers looked out the tower window and saw a bright orange light hovering. At Andrews Air Force Base, controllers also saw "huge fiery-orange spheres."
*   **Military Response:** F-94 Starfire jets were scrambled from Delaware, but by the time they arrived, the objects vanished from radar. When the jets left, the objects returned.[^2]

### Weekend 2: July 26-27, 1952
The objects returned a week later. This time, the Air Force was ready.
*   **The Chase:** F-94 jets intercepted the lights. Lt. **William Patterson** reported being surrounded by glowing blue-white lights. He radioed: *"I see them now and they're all around me. What should I do?"*
*   **The Maneuvers:** The objects showcased abilities far beyond 1952 technology, reversing direction instantly and traveling at estimated speeds of 7,000 mph.[^3]

## Official Explanation: Temperature Inversion

Facing national panic, the Air Force held a press conference on July 29, led by Major General **John Samford**.
*   **The Theory:** Samford attributed the radar blips to **"temperature inversions"** (layers of warm air trapping cool air), which can bend radar waves and pick up ground objects (like trucks) as false aerial targets.
*   **The Skepticism:** Radar operators and pilots vehemently disagreed. They knew what weather interference looked like; these blips were solid, flew in formation, and reacted to interceptors.
    > "For the first time in history, I saw a UFO... It was not a cloud, it was not a balloon, it was not a bird... It was a solid object." — *Al Chop, Air Force Press Spokesman*[^4]

## Impact

*   **CIA Involvement:** The D.C. flap scared the CIA into believing that the Soviets could use "UFO reports" to clog U.S. communication channels before a real attack. This led to the **Robertson Panel** (1953), which recommended debunking UFOs to reduce public interest.
*   **President Truman:** Truman discussions with Einstein about the event are a popular myth, but Truman was undeniably briefed and concerned about the vulnerability of the capital.[^5]
