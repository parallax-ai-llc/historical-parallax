## Summary

The Terracotta Army is a collection of thousands of life-sized terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China, buried with him around 210-209 BCE to protect him in the afterlife. Discovered accidentally in 1974 by local farmers near Xi'an, the army consists of over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots, 520 horses, and various officials—each with unique facial features. It is one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century, offering unprecedented insight into ancient Chinese military, art, and funerary practices. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of China's most visited attractions.

### First Emperor of China (r. 221-210 BCE)

**Unification:**
Conquered all rival Warring States, unified China under Qin Dynasty.

**Achievements:**
- Standardized writing, currency, weights, measures
- Built roads, canals
- Began Great Wall construction
- Established bureaucratic government

**Obsession with Death:**
Terrified of dying; sent expeditions seeking elixir of immortality. Began tomb construction at age 13.

**Death (210 BCE):**

## The Mausoleum Complex

### Scale

**Mausoleum:**
- Main tomb mound: 76 meters high (originally higher)
- Inner and outer city walls
- Covers ~56 square kilometers
- Construction involved 700,000 workers (according to ancient historian Sima Qian)

**Still Unexcavated:**
Central burial chamber containing emperor's body remains sealed. Legends describe:
- Rivers of mercury
- Map of China with flowing rivers
- Booby traps
- Celestial ceiling

Mercury contamination confirmed by soil analysis.

### Terracotta Army Pits

**Location:** 1.5 km east of mausoleum—guarding eastern approach

**Three Main Pits:**
1. **Pit 1:** Largest (14,000 sq meters). 6,000 warriors in battle formation.
2. **Pit 2:** Cavalry, archers, chariots. More varied figures.
3. **Pit 3:** Command headquarters. 68 figures, command chariot.

**Fourth Pit:** Empty. Possibly never completed (Qin Dynasty collapsed).

## The Figures

### Warriors

**Numbers:** 8,000+ soldiers (estimates vary; many unexcavated)

**Types:**
- Infantry (standing, kneeling)
- Archers
- Cavalry
- Charioteers
- Officers and generals

**Height:**
Average 1.8 meters (5'11")—taller than average ancient Chinese. May reflect idealized soldiers.

### Unique Features

**Individuality:**
Each figure has distinct:
- Facial features (age, expression)
- Hairstyles (reflecting regional origins)
- Armor styles
- Hand positions

**Theory:**
May represent actual soldiers in Qin army. Or created from modular parts combined in unique ways.

### Horses

- 520 chariot horses
- 150 cavalry horses
- Realistic anatomy

### Weapons

**Originally Armed:**
Figures held real bronze weapons:
- Swords
- Spears
- Crossbows
- Arrows

Many weapons looted by rebels after Qin Dynasty fell. Some preserved—still sharp after 2,200 years (chromium oxide coating).

## Creation and Craftsmanship

### Production

**Assembly Line:**
Figures made from interchangeable parts:
- Legs, torsos, arms, hands, heads separately molded
- Assembled, refined, painted

**Craftsmen:**
Names stamped on figures—quality control. Over 87 craftsmen identified.

### Color

**Originally Painted:**
Vibrant colors (red, blue, green, purple). Pigments deteriorate upon exposure to air. Conservation challenges.

**Modern Preservation:**
Researchers developed techniques to preserve remaining paint.
