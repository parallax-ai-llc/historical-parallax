## Summary

James Maynard is a British mathematician who won the Fields Medal in 2022 for contributions to analytic number theory, which have led to major advances in the understanding of the structure of prime numbers. He proved that there are infinitely many pairs of primes that differ by at most 600, and solved Duffin and Schaeffer conjecture.
