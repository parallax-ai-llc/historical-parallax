## Summary

David Howell Petraeus is a retired four-star United States Army general who served as the fourth Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from September 2011 until his resignation in November 2012.[^1] Over a 37-year military career, he became renowned as one of the most influential military strategists of the 21st century, particularly for his pioneering work in counterinsurgency warfare and his leadership during the Iraq War surge of 2007-2008.[^2] Petraeus commanded U.S. forces in Iraq during a critical period, implementing innovative population-centric counterinsurgency strategies that helped reduce violence by more than 75 percent.[^3] His career ended controversially when he resigned from the CIA after admitting to an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell, and later pleaded guilty to mishandling classified materials.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

David Howell Petraeus was born on November 7, 1952, in Cornwall-on-Hudson, New York, a small town located approximately six miles from the United States Military Academy at West Point.[^5] He was born into a family with strong immigrant roots and military traditions. His father, Sixtus Petraeus, was a Dutch immigrant who had served in the United States Army during World War II before working as a sea captain and later in the New York State Maritime Academy.[^6] His mother, Miriam Petraeus, was a homemaker who encouraged her children to pursue their passions and educational ambitions.[^7]

Growing up in Cornwall-on-Hudson during the 1950s and 1960s, young Petraeus was surrounded by military culture, as his hometown was filled with West Point professors and Army families.[^8] This environment significantly influenced his early aspirations toward military service. He excelled both academically and athletically during his formative years, demonstrating the competitive drive and intellectual curiosity that would later define his military career. At Cornwall Central High School, Petraeus distinguished himself as an outstanding student, ultimately graduating as class valedictorian in 1970.[^9]

The proximity to West Point and his father's military background created a natural pathway toward a military career. Petraeus enrolled at the United States Military Academy in 1970, joining the Class of 1974.[^10] At West Point, he continued to excel in multiple domains. He participated on the intercollegiate soccer and ski teams, demonstrating his athletic abilities, while also achieving academic distinction by graduating in the top 5 percent of his class, ranked 40th overall.[^11] He earned the designation of "distinguished cadet" academically and served as a cadet captain on the brigade staff, showing early leadership potential.[^12]

While at West Point, Petraeus began dating Holly Knowlton, the daughter of Army General William A. Knowlton, who was serving as the West Point superintendent at the time.[^13] This relationship would prove to be one of the most enduring aspects of his personal life. Petraeus graduated from West Point in 1974 with a Bachelor of Science degree in general engineering and was commissioned as an infantry officer.[^14] Just two months after graduation, on July 6, 1974, he married Holly Knowlton, beginning a partnership that would span decades and two children.[^15]

Following his commissioning, Petraeus pursued advanced education that would significantly shape his strategic thinking. He attended the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, where he earned a Master of Public Affairs degree in International Affairs in 1985.[^16] Continuing his academic studies, he completed his doctoral dissertation and was awarded a Ph.D. in International Affairs from Princeton in 1987.[^17] His doctoral research focused on military intervention and the lessons learned from the Vietnam War, topics that would profoundly influence his later development of counterinsurgency doctrine.[^18]

## Rise to Power

Petraeus's ascent through the military ranks was marked by a combination of combat leadership, intellectual contributions to military doctrine, and key command assignments that showcased his strategic abilities. After his early assignments as a junior infantry officer and his academic work at Princeton, he steadily built a reputation as both a combat leader and a military intellectual.

During the 1991 Gulf War, Petraeus served as the operations officer for the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, gaining valuable combat experience in large-scale conventional warfare.[^19] However, his career trajectory took a near-fatal turn shortly after the war when he was accidentally shot in the chest during a training exercise at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The bullet pierced his lung, and he required emergency surgery performed by Bill Frist, who would later become a U.S. Senator.[^20] Petraeus's remarkable physical recovery and determination to return to full military duty demonstrated the resilience that would characterize his later career.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Petraeus held a series of important command and staff positions. He commanded the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, and later served as the chief of operations for United Nations forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina.[^21] He was promoted to brigadier general in 1999 and continued to rise through the ranks, eventually commanding the 101st Airborne Division.[^22]

The 2003 invasion of Iraq marked a pivotal moment in Petraeus's career. As commander of the 101st Airborne Division, he led approximately 20,000 soldiers during the invasion and the subsequent occupation of northern Iraq, particularly in and around Mosul.[^23] His approach in Mosul became an early example of population-centric counterinsurgency, as he emphasized reconstruction, governance, and working with local leaders rather than purely kinetic military operations.[^24] Under his leadership, Mosul initially saw relative stability and economic recovery, earning him positive media attention and recognition for innovative approaches to post-conflict stabilization.

Following his success with the 101st Airborne, Petraeus was assigned to lead the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces from 2004 to 2005, a challenging mission during a period of increasing insurgent violence.[^25] While this assignment had mixed results due to the complexity of standing up new military and police forces in a conflict zone, it provided Petraeus with deep insights into the challenges of building partner capacity and the nature of insurgent warfare.

Petraeus's intellectual contributions to military doctrine became increasingly influential during this period. He played a central role in developing U.S. Army Field Manual 3-24, Counterinsurgency, published in December 2006.[^26] Working closely with General James Mattis and civilian experts, Petraeus helped create what became known as the "Petraeus Doctrine"—a comprehensive framework for population-centric counterinsurgency operations that emphasized protecting civilians, building local governance, and addressing the political and economic roots of insurgency.[^27] He served as the primary driver and editor of this manual, personally reading the entire document multiple times and providing extensive edits and comments, often turning around chapters within 24 hours.[^28]

When sectarian violence in Iraq reached catastrophic levels in 2006, with Baghdad experiencing up to 150 corpses discovered daily and the country appearing to slide toward civil war, the Bush administration decided on a significant change in strategy.[^29] On February 10, 2007, Petraeus took command of Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), tasked with implementing what became known as "the Surge"—both an increase of approximately 30,000 additional U.S. troops and, more significantly, a fundamental change in operational strategy.[^30]

## Major Achievements

General David Petraeus's most significant achievement was his successful implementation of the Iraq War surge strategy from 2007 to 2008, which fundamentally altered the trajectory of the conflict and became a landmark case study in modern military operations. Armed with the counterinsurgency principles he had helped develop in FM 3-24, Petraeus deployed the additional forces not to large forward operating bases but directly into Iraqi neighborhoods, living among the population they were tasked with protecting.[^31]

The surge strategy represented what Petraeus called "the surge of ideas," emphasizing that the change in strategic approach was more significant than the troop increase itself.[^32] The key elements included: prioritizing the security of Iraqi civilians, particularly in Baghdad; partnering closely with Iraqi Security Forces; engaging with local tribal leaders and former insurgents in what became known as the "Anbar Awakening"; establishing joint security stations in neighborhoods; and addressing both the security and political dimensions of the conflict simultaneously.[^33]

The results exceeded many expectations. Violence levels in Iraq dropped by more than 75 percent over Petraeus's eighteen months in command.[^34] Civilian deaths, sectarian killings, and attacks on coalition forces all decreased dramatically. The implementation of this "complex and sophisticated strategy" demonstrated that counterinsurgency principles, when properly resourced and executed, could reverse even deeply entrenched patterns of violence.[^35] Historians and military analysts credited Petraeus as the person who "more than any other, brought Iraq back from the brink of total disaster after he assumed command of U.S. forces there in 2007."[^36]

Following his success in Iraq, Petraeus was promoted to command U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) in October 2008, giving him oversight of military operations across the Middle East, Central Asia, and parts of South Asia.[^37] In this role, he oversaw operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan, providing strategic direction for the two major U.S. military commitments of the era. He served in this capacity until June 2010, when President Barack Obama nominated him to replace General Stanley McChrystal as commander of International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and U.S. Forces Afghanistan.[^38]

Petraeus's tenure in Afghanistan from July 2010 to July 2011 saw him attempt to apply counterinsurgency principles similar to those used in Iraq, though with more limited success due to different political, cultural, and geographical conditions.[^39] He issued an updated Tactical Directive in August 2010 emphasizing the prevention of civilian casualties and reinforcing "disciplined use of force in partnership with Afghan Security Forces."[^40] While violence initially decreased in some areas, the sustainability of gains in Afghanistan proved more challenging than in Iraq, partly due to the cross-border sanctuary enjoyed by insurgents in Pakistan and the different political dynamics of Afghan society.

Throughout his career, Petraeus achieved an unprecedented record of six consecutive commands as a general officer, five of which were in combat—a distinction unmatched in the post-World War II era.[^41] He was awarded numerous decorations, including four Defense Distinguished Service Medals, the Bronze Star Medal for Valor, and medals from the State Department, NATO, and United Nations.[^42] He earned recognition as "the world's leading expert in counterinsurgency warfare" and was widely regarded as one of the most effective American military commanders since Eisenhower.[^43]

In 2011, President Obama nominated Petraeus to serve as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, a position representing a transition from military to civilian intelligence leadership.[^44] The U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed him by a vote of 94-0, reflecting the broad bipartisan respect for his service and capabilities.[^45] As CIA Director from September 2011 to November 2012, Petraeus oversaw intelligence operations during a critical period that included the death of Osama bin Laden's aftermath, the Arab Spring upheavals, and ongoing counterterrorism operations.[^46]

Petraeus also made significant contributions to military education and strategic thinking. He developed an intellectual framework for strategic leadership comprising four essential tasks: brainstorming (getting the big ideas right), communicating those ideas effectively, implementing them through appropriate organizations and resources, and continuously assessing and refining the approach.[^47] This framework, often called "Petraeus's Big Four," has been widely adopted in military education and corporate leadership training.[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his significant achievements, David Petraeus's career was marked by substantial controversies and criticisms that ultimately led to his dramatic fall from grace and continue to shape assessments of his legacy. The most consequential controversy was the extramarital affair that ended his tenure as CIA Director and resulted in criminal prosecution.

On November 9, 2012, Petraeus resigned as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency after admitting to an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell.[^49] In a message sent to CIA staff, he acknowledged: "After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair."[^50] The affair came to light when Jill Kelley, an Honorary Ambassador to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, received threatening anonymous emails in May 2012 and contacted the FBI.[^51] The investigation traced the emails to Broadwell and revealed that Broadwell and Petraeus were exchanging intimate messages through shared email accounts.[^52]

The scandal deepened when it was discovered that Petraeus had shared classified information with Broadwell, who did not have appropriate security clearance for some of the materials.[^53] On April 23, 2015, Petraeus pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified materials, receiving a two-year probationary period and a fine of $100,000.[^54] This plea deal sparked controversy, with some critics arguing that he received lenient treatment compared to lower-ranking personnel who faced harsher penalties for similar violations, while others maintained the punishment was appropriate given the specific circumstances.[^55]

Beyond the personal scandal, Petraeus faced professional criticisms regarding his military strategies and leadership approach. Critics of the surge strategy argued that while violence decreased in the short term, the gains proved unsustainable and did not address the fundamental political divisions in Iraqi society.[^56] They pointed out that sectarian tensions resurged after American forces withdrew, leading to the rise of ISIS and renewed civil conflict, suggesting that the surge merely postponed rather than resolved Iraq's underlying problems.[^57] Some analysts contended that the strategy fostered dependency on U.S. forces rather than creating self-sustaining Iraqi security capabilities.[^58]

Petraeus's media strategy also drew substantial criticism. Some analysts argued that his sophisticated engagement with journalists and policymakers, while effective in shaping narratives, presented overly optimistic assessments that omitted inconvenient facts and distorted interpretations of events on the ground.[^59] Critics claimed this media-savvy approach proved damaging for American policy because Washington policymakers and the American public accepted these narratives without sufficient critical examination, potentially leading to flawed strategic decisions.[^60]

Within military circles, some peers found Petraeus's approach to be excessively self-promotional. Early in his career, he faced accusations of being overly ambitious and focused on personal advancement, which was off-putting to some colleagues who valued more modest leadership styles.[^61] While supporters argued that effective leadership requires visibility and communication, critics saw his high public profile and cultivation of media relationships as evidence of personal ambition overshadowing professional obligations.

Regarding Afghanistan, even Petraeus himself acknowledged limitations in the strategic approach, later stating that after the initial impressive campaign, the U.S. "really did not craft the right strategy, didn't land on the right big ideas, and didn't have the right level of resources deployed."[^62] This admission highlighted the difficulty of translating the Iraq surge model to a different context and suggested that counterinsurgency doctrine, while valuable, was not universally applicable regardless of circumstances.

The costs associated with the surge strategy also drew criticism. Skeptics noted the enormous financial burden—estimated in hundreds of billions of dollars—and questioned whether the temporary improvements justified the expenditure, particularly given the ultimate trajectory of Iraq after U.S. withdrawal.[^63] Additionally, the human cost of prolonged engagement, including American and Iraqi casualties during the surge period, remained a contentious aspect of assessing the strategy's overall value.

## Personal Life

David Petraeus married Holly Knowlton on July 6, 1974, just two months after his graduation from West Point.[^64] Holly, born Hollister K. Knowlton in Paris, France, came from a distinguished military family with extensive service spanning multiple generations.[^65] Her father was General William Allen Knowlton, a four-star Army general who served as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy—the position he held when Holly and David began dating.[^66] Holly's military lineage extended back through generations: her great-great grandfather fought in the Civil War and Indian Wars; her great-grandfather was a brigadier general who served in the Spanish-American War and World War I; and her grandfather served in both World Wars.[^67]

Holly graduated summa cum laude from Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1974 with honors in French.[^68] She built her own distinguished career in public service, ultimately serving as Assistant Director at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), where she headed the Office of Servicemember Affairs.[^69] Her work focused on educating service members about sound financial management and protecting them against predatory lending practices and financial exploitation—issues particularly relevant to military families.[^70] She retired from this position on January 12, 2017, after years of advocacy for military families' financial security.[^71]

The couple had two children: a daughter, Anne, and a son, Stephen.[^72] Stephen followed in his father's footsteps, becoming a United States Army officer who served with an airborne infantry combat team in Afghanistan, continuing the family's tradition of military service.[^73] This placed the Petraeus family among the small percentage of American families with multiple generations serving in combat zones during the post-9/11 wars.

Throughout Petraeus's 37-year military career, Holly embodied the role of a traditional military spouse, managing frequent relocations, extended deployments, and the demands of being married to an increasingly high-profile general officer. She became active in military spouse support networks and advocacy for military families, using her platform as the wife of a senior officer to address issues affecting the broader military community.

The revelation of Petraeus's affair with Paula Broadwell in November 2012 was devastating to their marriage. Broadwell, a West Point graduate and Army Reserve officer who held a master's degree from the University of Denver and was pursuing a doctorate at Harvard, had been given extensive access to Petraeus while researching and writing her biography, "All In: The Education of General David Petraeus."[^74] Reports indicated that Holly was "furious" upon learning of the affair, which had occurred during the most prominent phase of her husband's career.[^75] However, sources close to the family suggested that her 38 years of marriage and her identity as a military wife meant she would likely stand by him despite the betrayal.[^76]

Petraeus's personality has been described by colleagues and observers as intensely driven, intellectually curious, and highly competitive. He was known for his physical fitness regimen, often challenging younger soldiers to join him on runs and setting a personal example of discipline and endurance.[^77] Associates noted his voracious reading habits, his ability to work on minimal sleep during intense operational periods, and his skill at remembering names and personal details about subordinates—a trait that enhanced his leadership effectiveness.[^78]

His personal motto, "Tell me how this ends," became well-known during the Iraq War and reflected his focus on strategic outcomes rather than merely tactical successes.[^79] Another frequently cited personal maxim was "The idea is to go to bed every night with fewer enemies than you had in the morning," which encapsulated his approach to counterinsurgency and relationship-building.[^80]

## Legacy

David Petraeus's legacy remains complex and contested, reflecting both his undeniable contributions to military strategy and the controversies that marked the end of his public service career. Military historians have assessed him as potentially "the most effective American military commander since Eisenhower," a remarkable evaluation given the challenges of post-Cold War asymmetric warfare.[^81] His influence on how the U.S. military approaches irregular warfare, counterinsurgency, and stability operations fundamentally reshaped American military doctrine for the 21st century.

The most enduring aspect of Petraeus's legacy is his role in developing and implementing modern counterinsurgency doctrine. Field Manual 3-24, which he co-authored, became the doctrinal foundation for a generation of military officers and has been studied at war colleges and universities around the world.[^82] The manual's emphasis on protecting populations, understanding cultural and political contexts, and integrating military and civilian efforts represented a significant departure from the conventional warfare-focused approach that had dominated U.S. military thinking.[^83]

His strategic leadership framework—brainstorming, communication, implementation, and assessment—has been widely adopted beyond military contexts, influencing business leadership, public administration, and organizational management.[^84] This intellectual contribution demonstrates how his thinking transcended purely military applications and offered broader insights into complex problem-solving and organizational change.

The Iraq surge of 2007-2008 stands as the centerpiece of Petraeus's legacy, though its assessment continues to evolve. Supporters point to the dramatic reduction in violence, the temporary stabilization of Iraqi security conditions, and the demonstration that well-executed counterinsurgency operations could reverse even dire situations.[^85] This success influenced subsequent debates about U.S. military strategy in Afghanistan and other contexts, establishing Petraeus as the go-to expert on stabilization operations.

However, the long-term outcomes in Iraq have complicated this legacy. The resurgence of sectarian violence after U.S. withdrawal, the rise of the Islamic State, and Iraq's ongoing political dysfunction have led critics to question whether the surge merely delayed inevitable outcomes rather than creating sustainable change.[^86] This debate highlights a fundamental question about military intervention: can security improvements imposed by external forces create lasting stability without addressing underlying political and social divisions?

Petraeus's disgrace and resignation from the CIA significantly tarnished his legacy. The affair and mishandling of classified information transformed him from a celebrated public servant to a cautionary tale about hubris and the consequences of poor personal judgment.[^87] The criminal conviction, though for a misdemeanor, placed him among the very few senior officials to face legal consequences for mishandling classified materials, creating a permanent blemish on an otherwise distinguished record.[^88]

Despite the scandal, Petraeus remained engaged in public affairs after his resignation. He joined the faculty at the City University of New York as a visiting professor, continued to write and speak on international security issues, and became chairman of the KKR Global Institute, bringing his strategic expertise to the private sector.[^89] He has co-authored books on military history and strategy, including "Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine," demonstrating his continued intellectual engagement with military affairs.[^90]

The broader impact of Petraeus's career includes his influence on civil-military relations in the modern era. His sophisticated engagement with media, policymakers, and the public represented a new model of the general as public intellectual and policy advocate, though this approach also raised questions about appropriate boundaries between military leaders and political decision-making.[^91] His example has influenced how subsequent military leaders navigate public visibility, congressional testimony, and media engagement.

For the institution of the U.S. Army, Petraeus's legacy includes both the positive example of intellectual rigor and strategic innovation and the cautionary lesson about personal conduct and institutional values. The military continues to study his operational successes while also using his downfall as a case study in ethics and the importance of personal integrity at senior levels of leadership.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of David Petraeus emphasize his intellectual contributions to military strategy and his effectiveness as an operational commander during critical periods of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Military historian Peter Mansoor, who served as Petraeus's executive officer during the surge, has written extensively about how Petraeus's strategic vision and leadership transformed the Iraq campaign when it appeared headed for catastrophic failure.[^93] Mansoor and other defenders argue that the surge represented a masterclass in operational art, combining increased force levels with fundamentally different tactics and a sophisticated understanding of Iraqi political dynamics.

Academic and military analysts who praise Petraeus point to his record of six consecutive general officer commands, five in combat, as evidence of sustained excellence in the most challenging environments.[^94] They note that his approach to counterinsurgency synthesized classical military theory, lessons from historical irregular warfare, and contemporary understanding of complex adaptive systems, representing a significant intellectual achievement.[^95] Scholars at institutions like Stanford's Graduate School of Business have studied his strategic leadership framework as a model applicable well beyond military contexts, highlighting its value for organizational change and complex problem-solving.[^96]

Supporters also emphasize Petraeus's role as a transformational leader who changed not just tactics but the entire institutional culture of the U.S. military regarding stability operations and counterinsurgency. He championed the integration of civilian expertise into military planning, advocated for linguistic and cultural training for soldiers, and pushed for revised promotion and evaluation systems that rewarded officers with regional expertise and unconventional skills.[^97] These institutional changes outlasted his personal tenure and influenced how the Army recruited, trained, and developed leaders for post-Cold War security challenges.

Defenders of his legacy argue that judging the Iraq surge solely by Iraq's later trajectory is unfair, as Petraeus could not control political decisions made by both Iraqi and American governments after his departure.[^98] They maintain that he accomplished the mission he was given—reducing violence and creating space for political reconciliation—and that subsequent political failures should not diminish his operational success.[^99] Similarly, supporters note that his relatively brief tenure in Afghanistan did not provide sufficient time to implement a comprehensive strategy given the different conditions there.

Regarding the scandal that ended his CIA tenure, some observers have argued that while his personal conduct was indefensible, it should not entirely overshadow decades of distinguished service.[^100] They point out that many historical military figures had personal failings but are remembered primarily for their professional achievements, and suggest Petraeus deserves a similarly nuanced assessment that acknowledges both his contributions and his failures.

### Negative Views

Critics of David Petraeus offer substantially different assessments, arguing that his reputation exceeded his actual achievements and that his legacy is fundamentally compromised by both strategic shortcomings and ethical failures. Scholars skeptical of counterinsurgency doctrine argue that Petraeus oversold an approach that was resource-intensive, culturally problematic, and ultimately ineffective at creating sustainable political outcomes.[^101] They contend that the apparent success of the surge owed more to concurrent factors—including the Anbar Awakening that predated Petraeus's command, the decision by Muqtada al-Sadr to stand down the Mahdi Army, and ethnic cleansing that reduced sectarian mixing in Baghdad—than to American counterinsurgency tactics.[^102]

Critics point to the ultimate trajectory of Iraq, including the rise of ISIS and renewed civil conflict, as evidence that the surge merely postponed rather than prevented catastrophic outcomes.[^103] They argue that the enormous expenditure of American blood and treasure during the surge years purchased only temporary improvements, and that Petraeus's optimistic assessments to Congress and the media created false expectations that influenced continued American commitment to an ultimately unsuccessful mission.[^104] From this perspective, the surge was a tactical success but a strategic failure, and Petraeus's role in promoting it represents flawed judgment rather than strategic brilliance.

Some military analysts and journalists have argued that Petraeus's sophisticated media strategy and cultivation of political relationships crossed appropriate lines for a military officer.[^105] They suggest he became too involved in policy advocacy rather than remaining within proper civil-military boundaries, and that his high public profile and political engagement set problematic precedents for military officers seeking to influence policy debates.[^106] These critics view his career as representative of troubling trends in civil-military relations where senior officers become political figures rather than neutral implementers of civilian policy.

The scandal that ended his CIA tenure provides critics with evidence of deeper character flaws and poor judgment. They argue that his affair with Broadwell and the sharing of classified information demonstrated a sense of entitlement and disregard for rules that should have disqualified him from senior leadership positions.[^107] Some critics contend that the relatively lenient legal consequences he faced—compared to whistleblowers and lower-ranking personnel punished more severely for security violations—revealed a double standard in how senior officials are treated.[^108]

Within academic circles, critics of Petraeus have questioned the intellectual rigor of his counterinsurgency doctrine, suggesting it oversimplified complex political conflicts and presented military solutions to fundamentally political problems.[^109] They argue that the doctrine's emphasis on population security and governance support placed military forces in roles they were ill-suited to perform and created unrealistic expectations about what military force could achieve in fractured societies.[^110]

Some former military colleagues and subordinates have criticized Petraeus for self-promotion and taking credit for achievements that resulted from collective efforts.[^111] These critics suggest that his cultivation of media relationships and management of his public image reflected excessive personal ambition rather than selfless service, and that he was too willing to advance his own career at the expense of institutional cohesion and loyalty to peers.[^112]
