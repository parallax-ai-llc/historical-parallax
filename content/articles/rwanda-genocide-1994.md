## Summary

In the spring of 1994, Rwanda became the site of the fastest genocide in recorded history. In just 100 days, between April 7 and mid-July, members of the Hutu majority systematically murdered an estimated 800,000 to 1,000,000 people—primarily ethnic Tutsis but also moderate Hutus. That is roughly 10,000 deaths per day, 400 per hour, 7 per minute.[^1]

The killing was not spontaneous. It was planned, organized, and executed with bureaucratic precision. Lists of targets had been compiled. Weapons—notably machetes—had been stockpiled. Radio stations broadcast where Tutsis were hiding. Roadblocks prevented escape. Neighbors killed neighbors. Teachers killed students. Priests betrayed those who sought sanctuary in churches.[^2]

The world watched and did nothing. The United Nations reduced its peacekeeping force even as bodies piled in the streets. The United States refused to call it "genocide" because that would legally obligate intervention. France continued to support the génocidaire government. When the killing finally ended, it was not because of international action, but because the Rwandan Patriotic Front, a rebel army led by Paul Kagame, conquered the country.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Colonial Legacy

The roots of the genocide reach back to European colonialism:

- **Pre-colonial Rwanda:** Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa shared language (Kinyarwanda), culture, and religion. Distinctions were largely socioeconomic, and intermarriage was common
- **1895-1916:** German colonization began the process of "racializing" ethnic categories
- **1916-1962:** Belgian rule intensified divisions. In 1926, Belgians introduced identity cards marking each person as Hutu, Tutsi, or Twa
- **Belgian policy:** Tutsis were classified as racially superior—taller, lighter-skinned, more "European"—and given preferential access to education and administrative positions
- **Result:** A rigid caste system where 14% of the population (Tutsi) ruled over 85% (Hutu)[^4]

### Hutu Revolution (1959-1962)

- **1959:** Hutu uprising against Tutsi monarchy
- **20,000 Tutsis killed;** hundreds of thousands fled to Uganda, Burundi, DRC
- **1962:** Rwanda gained independence as Hutu-dominated republic
- **Subsequent decades:** Periodic anti-Tutsi pogroms; Tutsis as permanent scapegoats
- **Tutsi diaspora:** Children of refugees grew up stateless, dreaming of return[^5]

### Rwandan Civil War (1990-1993)

- **October 1990:** Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), comprising Tutsi refugees, invaded from Uganda
- **Leader:** Paul Kagame, trained in military intelligence
- **Three years of war:** Neither side could achieve victory
- **August 1993:** Arusha Accords signed—ceasefire, power-sharing, integration of RPF
- **Hutu extremists' response:** The accords were treason; they began planning "final solution"[^6]

## The Genocide

### The Trigger

**April 6, 1994:** At 8:30 PM, a plane carrying President Juvénal Habyarimana (Rwanda) and President Cyprien Ntaryamira (Burundi) was shot down by missiles over Kigali.

Who fired the missiles remains disputed—RPF or Hutu extremists—but the event was used as the pretext for mass murder that had been planned for months.[^7]

### Day One: April 7, 1994

**Within hours:**
- Presidential Guard and Interahamwe militia activated
- Roadblocks set up across Kigali
- Lists of targets distributed
- **First victim:** Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu
- **10 Belgian UN peacekeepers** protecting her were captured, tortured, and murdered

**The signal had been given.** The killing spread from the capital to every corner of the country.[^8]

### The Mechanism of Murder

**Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines (RTLM):**
- Called Tutsis "inyenzi" (cockroaches) and "inzoka" (snakes)
- Broadcast names and addresses of targets
- Encouraged Hutus to "cut down the tall trees"
- Promised that Tutsi property could be seized by killers

**Interahamwe ("Those Who Attack Together"):**
- Youth militia trained for months
- Estimated 30,000 members
- Distributed machetes, clubs, and firearms
- Set up roadblocks checking identity cards

**Church complicity:**
- Many churches became killing sites
- Priests and nuns in some cases betrayed those seeking sanctuary
- Nyamata Church: 10,000 murdered
- Ntarama Church: 5,000 murdered[^9]

### Methods

The genocide was carried out primarily with:
- **Machetes** (most common)
- **Clubs with nails (masus)**
- **Agricultural tools**
- **Grenades** (for crowds in buildings)
- **Firearms** (for military targets)

Bullets were expensive; machetes were cheap. The intimacy of the killing—face to face, neighbor to neighbor—was part of its horror.[^10]

### Sexual Violence

Rape was systematically used as a weapon:
- **250,000-500,000 women raped**
- Many deliberately infected with HIV
- Sexual violence as "ethnic weapon"—children born of rape would be "Hutu"
- Survivors faced decades of trauma, disease, and social stigma[^11]

### International Failure

**United Nations:**
- UNAMIR (UN peacekeeping mission) had 2,500 troops
- Commander Romeo Dallaire warned of impending genocide months in advance
- After 10 Belgian peacekeepers killed, Belgium withdrew
- **April 21:** UN reduced force to 270 troops
- Dallaire begged for reinforcements; was refused

**United States:**
- Clinton administration avoided word "genocide" (which would trigger obligation under 1948 Convention)
- Officials used euphemism "acts of genocide"
- No significant intervention

**France:**
- Had supported Habyarimana regime for years
- Trained and armed government forces
- "Operation Turquoise" in June—ostensibly humanitarian, but allowed génocidaires to escape to DRC

**The world abandoned Rwanda.** When 800,000 Americans or Europeans are being murdered, intervention is assumed. When 800,000 Africans were murdered, the world debated semantics.[^12]

## Death Toll

**Estimates vary:**
- Conservative scholarly estimate: 500,000-662,000 Tutsi victims
- Rwandan government figure: over 1,000,000 total
- Approximately **75% of all Tutsis in Rwanda were killed**

**Additional casualties:**
- 10,000+ Twa (third ethnic group)
- 10,000-30,000 moderate Hutus
- 2 million refugees fled the country
- 1 million internally displaced[^13]

### Victims

| Name | Significance |
|------|--------------|
| Agathe Uwilingiyimana | Moderate Hutu PM; first targeted victim |

## The End

### RPF Victory

The genocide ended not through international intervention but through military conquest:

- **May-June 1994:** RPF advanced steadily from Uganda
- **July 4:** RPF captured Kigali
- **Mid-July:** RPF controlled most of country
- **July 18:** Ceasefire declared

**The RPF stopped the genocide by defeating the génocidaire government.**[^14]

### Refugee Crisis

As RPF advanced, 2 million Hutus fled—many fearing RPF retribution, others guilty génocidaires:

- Massive camps in eastern Zaire (DRC)
- Interahamwe reorganized in camps
- Humanitarian crisis; cholera outbreaks
- Seeds of future Congo wars[^15]

---

## Aftermath

### Justice

**International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR):**
- Established by UN in November 1994
- Prosecuted senior leaders
- First international conviction for genocide since Nuremberg
- Jean Kambanda: first head of government convicted of genocide

**Gacaca Courts:**
- Traditional community justice adapted for mass prosecutions
- 1.2 million suspects—far too many for conventional trials
- Emphasis on confession, truth-telling, reconciliation
- Criticized by some for lacking due process

**Conviction rate:** Many génocidaires imprisoned; key leaders sentenced internationally; but perpetrators also integrated back into communities through gacaca process[^16]

### Reconciliation

Rwanda pursued a controversial path:
- **Ethnic identity abolished:** No more Hutu, Tutsi, Twa on ID cards
- **Narrative control:** Government-imposed unity ideology
- **Economic development:** Remarkable growth under Kagame
- **Criticism:** Authoritarian governance; suppression of dissent; unresolved trauma[^17]

### Regional Consequences

The genocide had devastating effects beyond Rwanda:
- **First Congo War (1996-1997):** RPF-backed forces invaded Zaire
- **Second Congo War (1998-2003):** "Africa's World War"—5 million dead
- **Ongoing instability:** Eastern DRC remains contested; Hutu militias active
- **Burundi:** Parallel ethnic tensions; periodic violence[^18]

## Historical Assessment

### Why It Happened

The genocide was **not** spontaneous African tribalism. It was:

1. **Colonial construction:** Europeans created rigid ethnic categories
2. **Elite manipulation:** Political leaders used ethnicity for power
3. **Economic crisis:** 1990s coffee price collapse intensified competition
4. **War psychology:** Civil war created fear and dehumanization
5. **Planning:** Months of preparation, weapon distribution, target lists
6. **International indifference:** World powers signaled they would not intervene

### Lessons (Unlearned)

"Never again" was said after the Holocaust. Rwanda proved it hollow.

- **Early warning systems failed:** Dallaire's warnings were ignored
- **Political will was absent:** No major power was willing to act
- **"Genocide" became a political term:** Avoiding the word became policy
- **International institutions proved inadequate:** The UN was paralyzed

Similar dynamics would recur in Srebrenica (1995), Darfur (2003-2004), and elsewhere.[^19]

## Legacy

### For Rwanda

- April 7 is now **Kwibuka** (Remembrance Day)
- Gisozi Genocide Memorial: 250,000 victims buried
- "Rwandan miracle" of economic development—but at cost of political freedom
- 30th anniversary in 2024: new generations inherit trauma and memory

### For the World

- Rwanda reshaped international law on genocide
- R2P (Responsibility to Protect) doctrine emerged from failure
- Dallaire became global advocate against genocide
- "Hotel Rwanda" made story known internationally
- But: lessons not applied to subsequent atrocities[^20]
