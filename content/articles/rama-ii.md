## Summary

Phutthaloetla Naphalai, known by his regnal name Rama II, was the second King of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, reigning from 1809 to 1824. His reign is remembered as the "Golden Age of Rattanakosin Literature" and marked a cultural renaissance following the military campaigns of his father's era.[^1] A gifted poet, playwright, musician, and artist, Rama II was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Person in 1968 for his extraordinary contributions to Thai arts and culture.[^2] His fifteen-year reign was largely peaceful, characterized by diplomatic relations with Western powers and the flourishing of Thai literature, drama, and traditional arts.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Phutthaloetla Naphalai was born Chim on February 24, 1767 (some sources cite 1768), in Amphawa District, Samut Songkram Province, during the Ayutthaya Kingdom period.[^4] He was the son of Luang Yokkrabat of Ratchaburi (later King Rama I) and Nak of Samut Sakorn (later Queen Amarindra).[^5] Born into tumultuous times, young Chim's early years were marked by the fall of Ayutthaya to Konbaung Burmese invaders in 1767, the very year of his birth.[^6]

His father, then known as Phraya Ratchaburi, joined King Taksin's forces to recapture the fallen capital and rose rapidly through military ranks as a successful commander in campaigns to subjugate Laos and Cambodia.[^7] Under King Taksin, Chim's father gained prominence and influence, setting the stage for the eventual founding of the Chakri dynasty. Young Chim grew up during this period of national reconstruction and political consolidation following the destruction of Ayutthaya.[^8]

In 1782, a pivotal moment arrived when Chim's father deposed King Taksin and crowned himself King of Siam, establishing the Chakri dynasty as Rama I.[^9] The young Chim, then approximately fifteen years old, was elevated to princely status and granted the title of Prince Itsarasunthon of Siam.[^10] This marked the beginning of his formal preparation for eventual kingship.

As Prince Itsarasunthon, he received comprehensive training in governance, statecraft, and military affairs, reflecting the standard preparation for Siamese royal heirs in the newly established Chakri dynasty.[^11] During his youth, he participated in the massive cultural reconstruction project initiated by his father, helping to recompose missing or damaged parts of Thai literary masterpieces, including the Ramakien and Khun Chang Khun Phaen, which had been lost during the sack of Ayutthaya.[^12] This early exposure to literature and the arts would profoundly shape his future reign.

In 1807, Prince Itsarasunthon was appointed to the Front Palace as Lord of the Front Palace (Uparaja), succeeding his uncle Maha Sura Singhanat who had died in 1803.[^13] This position traditionally designated the heir apparent to the throne. Prince Itsarasunthon's artistic inclinations were already evident during this period, as he cultivated relationships with poets and artists who would later form the core of his literary court.[^14]

---

## Rise to Power

Prince Itsarasunthon's path to the throne was relatively straightforward compared to many historical successions, though not without its complexities. As the eldest surviving legitimate son of King Rama I and Queen Amarindra, he held a strong claim to succession.[^15] His appointment as Front Palace Lord in 1807 effectively confirmed his status as crown prince, though this position came four years after the death of the previous occupant, his uncle.[^16]

When King Rama I (Buddha Yotfa Chulaloke) died in 1809, Prince Itsarasunthon succeeded to the throne without significant opposition, ascending as King Phutthaloetla Naphalai, or Rama II.[^17] The succession was smooth partly because of his legitimate birth status and his father's clear designation of him as heir through the Front Palace appointment.[^18]

However, his accession was not predetermined from birth. During his years as Prince Itsarasunthon, he had to navigate complex family dynamics and court politics. His father, Rama I, had multiple sons from various consorts, creating a large pool of potential heirs.[^19] Prince Itsarasunthon's position was strengthened by his mother's status as the principal queen and by his own demonstrated capabilities in administrative and cultural matters.[^20]

Unlike his father, who had seized power through military prowess and political maneuvering, Rama II came to power through legitimate hereditary succession within an established dynasty.[^21] This transition marked an important moment for the young Chakri dynasty, demonstrating its stability and the successful transfer of power from the founder to the second generation.[^22]

The new king's temperament and interests differed markedly from his warrior father. Where Rama I had consolidated the kingdom through military campaigns and administrative reforms, Rama II was inclined toward peace, culture, and the arts.[^23] As a devout Buddhist, he was more interested in cultural development and religious patronage than territorial expansion.[^24] This shift in focus from military to cultural matters would define his reign and establish a different model of kingship for Siam.[^25]

Upon ascending the throne, Rama II inherited a kingdom that had been militarily secured and administratively organized by his father.[^26] The major threats from Burma had been addressed, and the kingdom's borders were relatively stable.[^27] This allowed the new king to focus his energies on cultural reconstruction and the revival of Thai arts and literature, which had suffered tremendously during the destruction of Ayutthaya and the subsequent wars.[^28]

## Major Achievements

### Cultural Renaissance and Literary Patronage

Rama II's most significant achievement was transforming his reign into what historians call the "Golden Age of Rattanakosin Literature."[^29] His court became a center for poets, playwrights, and artists, with the king himself actively participating in literary creation.[^30] It was said that during his reign, anyone who could write refined poetry could become a royal favorite, as the king himself was an accomplished poet.[^31]

The most notable poet employed by Rama II was Sunthorn Phu, who would become Thailand's most celebrated literary figure and author of the epic Phra Aphai Mani.[^32] Rama II recognized Sunthorn Phu's extraordinary talent and awarded him the title of "Khun Sunthorn Voharn," making him a royal favorite and literary adviser.[^33] The king spent long hours daily writing poetry with his chosen literary companions, including Sunthorn Phu, creating an unprecedented atmosphere of artistic creativity at court.[^34]

Rama II's own literary output was substantial and influential. He wrote a famous version of Inao, based on the East-Javanese Panji tales, which has been considered his masterpiece and the best work of court performance literature.[^35] The Royal Academy during the reign of King Rama VI (1910-1925) named Rama II's Inao the best book of theatrical literature.[^36] The work contains beautiful poetry, with scenes like "Inao and Bussaba in the Cave" being called one of the most beautiful poems in Thai literature.[^37]

He also created Sang Thong, a play based on a Buddhist jataka story about a nobleman who disguises himself as a black-skinned savage.[^38] Additionally, Rama II adapted his father's edition of the Ramakien for khon drama, a form of theater performed by non-speaking dancers in elaborate costumes and masks.[^39] His version differed from his father's by giving an expanded role to Hanuman, the god-king of the apes, and adding a happy ending.[^40] In 1815, by royal order, the Ramakien was written in a form suitable for khon and lakhon performances.[^41]

### Musical and Artistic Contributions

Beyond literature, Rama II was a renowned musician who played and composed for the fiddle, introducing new techniques for playing certain instruments.[^42] His musical innovations influenced Thai classical music for generations.[^43] The king was also an accomplished sculptor, personally carving traditional Thai dance masks.[^44] Most notably, he is credited with sculpting the face of the Niramitr Buddha image in Wat Arun, one of Bangkok's most important temples.[^45]

### Religious and Temple Construction

Rama II was deeply devout and made significant contributions to Buddhist institutions. He restored Wat Arun (the Temple of Dawn) and initiated ambitious plans to raise the main pagoda to 70 meters.[^46] The king had strong faith in Buddhism and began construction of a new Phra Prang over the original 16-meter tall structure.[^47] Though the construction was completed during his successor's reign in 1851, Rama II's vision and initial work established Wat Arun as one of Thailand's most iconic religious monuments.[^48] Some of his ashes are interred in the base of the presiding sacred golden Niramitr Buddha image in the temple.[^49]

To help the population understand and practice Buddhism, Rama II translated Pali prayers into Thai, making religious texts more accessible to ordinary people.[^50] He established the education and examination system of Buddhism by dividing it into nine levels.[^51] In 1817, he revived the Vesak festival (Visakha Bucha), celebrating the day Buddha was born, enlightened, and died.[^52]

### Administrative Reforms

Despite his cultural focus, Rama II implemented important administrative reforms. He introduced harsh punishments for anyone found gambling on animal fights, such as cockfighting.[^53] He ordered that all land must be cultivated or it would revert to the state for re-allocation, promoting agricultural productivity.[^54] The king commissioned a comprehensive survey of the kingdom to determine land ownership, preventing false claims and misappropriation.[^55]

### Foreign Relations and Diplomacy

During Rama II's reign, Western colonial influences were beginning to be felt in Southeast Asia. His approach to foreign relations would establish Thailand's strategy of negotiation and diplomacy to avoid colonization.[^56] Two attempts were made in 1821 to secure commercial treaties between Singapore and Thailand, both unsuccessful—the first led by John Morgan, the second by John Crawfurd.[^57] After recently throwing off Burmese occupation and establishing autonomy, the Thai people were cautious about encouraging foreign presence in their territory.[^58]

However, Rama II's reign marked the reopening of relations with the West, laying groundwork that his successors would build upon.[^59] His example of entering negotiation with colonial powers would become Thailand's mechanism to avoid domination and loss of independence.[^60] This diplomatic approach proved crucial for Thailand's future as the only Southeast Asian nation to avoid European colonization.

In regional affairs, Thailand experienced a confrontation with Vietnam over control of Cambodia in 1813, and Rama II successfully maintained Cambodia under Thai suzerainty.[^61] He also began a forward policy on the Malay Peninsula, extending Thai influence southward.[^62]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Succession Controversy and Death

The circumstances surrounding Rama II's death remain controversial. He died "very suddenly" on July 21, 1824.[^63] Contemporary accounts attributed his death to strangury (a painful urinary condition), but persistent rumors suggested he had been poisoned.[^64] These rumors have never been definitively proven or disproven, leaving a cloud of uncertainty over his final days.

The succession following his death created immediate controversy. Rama II had not named a clear successor, and the viceroy (Maha Senanurak) had already died in 1817, leaving a power vacuum.[^65] According to the succession rule theoretically in force, the throne should have passed to Prince Mongkut, the son of Queen Sri Suriyendra.[^66] However, his elder half-brother, Prince Chetsadabodin (born to a concubine), succeeded instead as Rama III on the same day.[^67]

The assembled Senabodi (council of nobles) considered Prince Chetsadabodin more competent because he had served the king in the Kromma Tha (Ministry of Trade and Foreign Relations) for years and had experience putting down revolts.[^68] Strong support came from high-ranking nobility, including Chao Phraya Abhay Pudhorn, the Samuha Nayok, and Dis Bunnag, then Minister of Kromma Tha, along with other influential Bunnag family members.[^69] The elder brother's experience counted for more than the theoretical claim of the much younger and inexperienced Mongkut, who nevertheless later succeeded his elder brother as Rama IV.[^70]

This succession dispute, though resolved without violence, revealed tensions in the succession system and demonstrated the continued importance of noble factions in determining royal succession, even within an established dynasty.

### Personal Scandals

Rama II's personal life was not without scandal. As Prince Itsarasunthon, he had a secret affair with his own cousin, Princess Bunrot.[^71] In 1801, King Rama I discovered that Princess Bunrot had been pregnant for four months and banished her from the palace.[^72] Prince Itsarasunthon begged his father for forgiveness, and the princess was eventually reinstated as his consort.[^73] When he became king, Princess Bunrot was elevated to Queen Sri Suriyendra.[^74] This incident revealed both his willingness to violate court protocol and his ability to persuade his father despite serious transgressions.

### Cautious Foreign Policy Criticisms

Some modern historians have criticized Rama II's cautious approach to Western powers, suggesting that more proactive engagement might have better prepared Siam for the colonial pressures that would intensify in subsequent decades.[^75] The failed treaty negotiations of 1821 demonstrated a resistance to foreign commerce that, while understandable given Thailand's recent history with Burma, may have delayed necessary modernization.[^76]

### Limited Military Activity

Unlike his father, Rama II conducted few military campaigns and showed little interest in territorial expansion.[^77] While this created a peaceful reign that allowed cultural flourishing, some critics argue it left the kingdom vulnerable and failed to fully consolidate Thai control over tributary states.[^78] The confrontation with Vietnam over Cambodia in 1813, while ultimately successful, revealed ongoing challenges in maintaining regional dominance that his father had established.[^79]

### Favoritism and Court Access

Rama II's policy that skilled poets could become royal favorites created opportunities for talented commoners but also led to charges of favoritism and the elevation of individuals based on artistic rather than administrative merit.[^80] While this produced great literature, it may have weakened the traditional aristocratic structures that governed the kingdom.

---

## Personal Life

### Family and Relationships

Rama II had an extraordinarily large family, fathering seventy-three children (some sources cite eighty-three) with various wives and concubines.[^81] This prolific reproduction was typical of Siamese monarchs and served both dynastic and political purposes, creating alliances through marriage and ensuring multiple heirs.[^82]

His relationship with Princess Bunrot (later Queen Sri Suriyendra) was particularly significant, beginning as a forbidden love affair when both were cousins at his father's court.[^83] Despite the scandal when their relationship was discovered in 1801, their bond endured, and she bore him two sons who would become kings: Mongkut (born 1804, later Rama IV) and Pinklao (born 1808).[^84] Mongkut would become famous as the king depicted in "Anna and the King of Siam."

He also married his agnatic half-sister, Princess Kunthon Thipphayawadi, with whom he had three sons: Prince Abhorn (1816), Prince Klang (1819), and Prince Piu (1822).[^85] Such marriages between close relatives were common among Siamese royalty to maintain bloodline purity and concentrate power within the dynasty.

Another significant relationship was with his concubine Riam (later elevated to Princess Mother Sri Sulalai), who bore him Prince Thap in 1787, before he became king.[^86] Prince Thap would succeed him as Rama III, demonstrating that sons born to concubines could achieve the highest positions if they possessed the necessary capabilities and support.[^87]

### Personality and Character

Rama II's personality contrasted sharply with his warrior father. He was contemplative, artistic, and deeply spiritual.[^88] His devotion to Buddhism was genuine and informed his governance philosophy, emphasizing peace over conquest and cultural development over territorial expansion.[^89] Unlike many monarchs of his era, he genuinely preferred spending time composing poetry and music to conducting military campaigns or court politics.[^90]

Contemporary accounts describe him as generous with artists and poets, creating an atmosphere of creative freedom unusual for a royal court.[^91] He would spend long hours daily in literary composition with his favorite poets, treating them as colleagues rather than merely subjects.[^92] This accessibility and genuine love of the arts won him deep loyalty from the cultural community.[^93]

However, he was not without political acumen. His ability to navigate the scandal with Princess Bunrot, eventually marrying her and elevating her to queen, showed diplomatic skill in managing his father and court opinion.[^94] His successful maintenance of the kingdom's peace and stability during his fifteen-year reign demonstrated competent, if unspectacular, governance.[^95]

### Daily Life and Interests

Beyond poetry and drama, Rama II was a practicing musician and sculptor.[^96] He personally carved dance masks and sculpted the Buddha image in Wat Arun, showing hands-on artistic engagement rare for a monarch.[^97] His introduction of new fiddle-playing techniques indicates he was not merely a patron but an innovator in Thai classical music.[^98]

The king's daily routine reportedly centered on artistic activities, with mornings devoted to religious observances and afternoons to literary and musical composition.[^99] This lifestyle reflected his priorities and the peaceful nature of his reign, which allowed such cultural pursuits.[^100]

## Legacy

### Cultural Impact

Rama II's most enduring legacy is his profound impact on Thai literature and arts. His reign as the "Golden Age of Rattanakosin Literature" established standards for Thai poetry and drama that influenced subsequent centuries.[^101] The works he personally created—Inao, Sang Thong, and his version of the Ramakien—remain cornerstone texts of Thai classical literature, still performed and studied today.[^102]

His patronage of Sunthorn Phu enabled the creation of Phra Aphai Mani, considered Thailand's greatest literary epic.[^103] By encouraging his sons Jessadabodindra and Paramanuchitchinorot to excel in poetry, he established a royal tradition of literary accomplishment that continued through several subsequent reigns.[^104] The literary salon he created served as a model for cultural patronage that future Thai monarchs would emulate.[^105]

### UNESCO Recognition

In 1968, UNESCO declared Rama II a World Heritage Person, recognizing his extraordinary contributions to world culture.[^106] This international acknowledgment placed him among a select group of historical figures honored for their cultural achievements. A Memorial Park was dedicated to Rama II in Bangkok, where an annual memorial fair is held in his honor, demonstrating his continued importance to Thai national identity.[^107]

### Religious Contributions

Rama II's religious reforms and temple constructions left lasting marks on Thai Buddhism. Wat Arun, completed by his successor according to his plans, remains one of Bangkok's most iconic landmarks and a major pilgrimage site.[^108] His translation of Pali prayers into Thai democratized Buddhist practice, making religious texts accessible to laypeople who could not read Pali.[^109] The nine-level Buddhist education and examination system he established provided structure for monastic education.[^110] His revival of the Vesak festival in 1817 restored an important Buddhist celebration that continues as a major religious holiday in Thailand.[^111]

### Diplomatic Legacy

Perhaps underappreciated during his lifetime, Rama II's cautious but engaged approach to Western powers established Thailand's diplomatic strategy of negotiation over confrontation.[^112] His willingness to discuss treaties while maintaining sovereignty provided a template that his successors, particularly Rama IV (Mongkut) and Rama V (Chulalongkorn), would develop into the sophisticated diplomatic approach that allowed Thailand to remain independent while its neighbors fell to colonialism.[^113]

His successful management of regional relations, particularly maintaining Thai suzerainty over Cambodia against Vietnamese pressure, preserved Thai influence in mainland Southeast Asia.[^114] The forward policy on the Malay Peninsula he initiated extended Thai control southward, establishing positions that would be important in later negotiations with the British.[^115]

### Dynastic Stability

By successfully transferring power from the dynasty's founder to the second generation, Rama II established the Chakri dynasty's legitimacy and demonstrated its stability.[^116] Though the succession after his death was contested, both claimants were his sons, and the matter was resolved peacefully through noble consensus rather than civil war.[^117] Two of his sons became kings (Rama III and Rama IV), ensuring dynastic continuity and the transmission of his cultural values.[^118]

### Model of Kingship

Rama II established an alternative model of Thai kingship—the scholar-king and artist-king—as valid as the warrior-king model his father represented.[^119] This expanded the possibilities for royal legitimacy beyond military prowess to include cultural accomplishment and religious devotion.[^120] Later Thai kings, particularly Rama VI, would embrace this model, seeing cultural development as central to royal duty.[^121]

### Preservation of Thai Identity

Most fundamentally, Rama II's cultural renaissance helped preserve and reconstruct Thai identity after the catastrophic destruction of Ayutthaya.[^122] By reviving damaged literary works, creating new masterpieces, and establishing a vibrant artistic culture, he ensured that Thai civilization would have a continuous cultural tradition despite the historical rupture of 1767.[^123] His support for traditional art forms, literature, language, and customs had a profound impact on developing a distinctly Thai cultural identity separate from neighboring civilizations.[^124]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars widely praise Rama II as one of Thailand's most culturally significant monarchs. Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, considered the father of Thai history, identified Rama II's reign as a crucial period in Thai cultural development, noting that the king's personal involvement in the arts elevated their status and ensured their preservation.[^125]

Literary scholars particularly celebrate his contributions. Professor Nithi Aeusrivongse of Chiang Mai University has argued that Rama II's Inao represents the pinnacle of Thai court drama, combining sophisticated poetry with dramatic structure in ways that influenced all subsequent Thai theatrical literature.[^126] The work's designation as the best book of theatrical literature by the Royal Academy confirms this scholarly consensus.[^127]

International recognition through UNESCO's 1968 declaration as a World Heritage Person validated Thai scholarly opinion on the global stage.[^128] This recognition acknowledged that Rama II's cultural contributions transcended national boundaries and represented achievements of universal significance.[^129]

Historians of Southeast Asian Buddhism credit Rama II with democratizing Buddhist practice through his Thai translations of Pali texts and systematizing monastic education.[^130] Dr. Prapod Assavavirulhakarn of Chulalongkorn University has noted that these reforms made Buddhism more accessible to ordinary Thais and strengthened its role in national identity.[^131]

Diplomatic historians increasingly appreciate Rama II's cautious approach to Western powers. Dr. Thongchai Winichakul of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has argued that Rama II's refusal to hastily sign treaties in 1821, while appearing isolationist, actually preserved Thai sovereignty during a crucial period when premature engagement might have led to unfavorable concessions.[^132] His negotiation-oriented approach established patterns his more famous successors would develop into Thailand's successful resistance to colonization.[^133]

Art historians and musicologists celebrate Rama II's hands-on artistic practice. His personal composition of music, carving of Buddha images, and creation of dance masks demonstrated that Thai monarchs could be practicing artists, not merely patrons.[^134] This model influenced later kings, particularly Rama VI, who was also an accomplished playwright.[^135]

Thai cultural nationalists view Rama II's reign as foundational to Thai identity. By reviving and creating classical literature, supporting traditional arts, and promoting Thai language and culture, he helped establish what it meant to be Thai in ways that endured through modernization and globalization.[^136]

### Negative Views

Some historians criticize Rama II for excessive focus on culture at the expense of military and administrative development. Dr. Charnvit Kasetsiri of Thammasat University has suggested that the peaceful cultural focus, while admirable, left Thailand less prepared for the aggressive colonial expansion that would characterize the mid-19th century.[^137]

Military historians note that Rama II conducted few campaigns and showed little interest in expanding or even firmly consolidating his father's territorial gains.[^138] The confrontation with Vietnam over Cambodia in 1813, while successful, revealed ongoing challenges in maintaining regional dominance.[^139] Some argue that more assertive military policies during his reign might have better secured Thai borders and influence.[^140]

Critics of his foreign policy point to the failed treaty negotiations of 1821 as missed opportunities. While his caution protected sovereignty, it may have delayed necessary engagement with Western technology, military techniques, and economic practices that could have strengthened Thailand.[^141] By the time his successors seriously engaged with Western powers in the 1850s, Thailand was negotiating from a weaker position.[^142]

Administrative historians note that Rama II made relatively few reforms to government structure despite his father having established a foundation for modernization.[^143] His land survey and gambling prohibitions, while useful, did not represent systematic administrative reform.[^144] The kingdom remained essentially medieval in structure, creating challenges for his successors.[^145]

The succession crisis following his death has been criticized as evidence of his failure to clearly establish succession principles.[^146] His lack of a named heir and the resulting noble intervention to select Rama III over the theoretically more legitimate Mongkut revealed weaknesses in dynastic organization.[^147]

Some literary critics, while praising Rama II's poetry, note that his intense focus on court literature and high classical forms may have neglected popular culture and folk traditions.[^148] The emphasis on refined poetry accessible only to educated elites arguably widened cultural gaps between the court and common people.[^149]

Feminist historians have criticized the harem system Rama II maintained, noting his seventy-three children represented relationships with numerous women whose agency and choices are not recorded in historical sources.[^150] The scandal with Princess Bunrot, while resolved, demonstrated aristocratic male privilege and the limited autonomy of royal women.[^151]

Economic historians argue that Rama II's conservative economic policies and resistance to foreign trade limited Thailand's economic development.[^152] While protecting sovereignty, these policies may have slowed economic growth and technological adoption that could have strengthened the kingdom.[^153]
