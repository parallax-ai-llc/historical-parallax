## Summary

Ramanuja (1017-1137 CE) was one of the most influential Hindu philosophers and theologians in Indian history, whose teachings fundamentally shaped the Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism) school of Vedanta philosophy. Born in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu, he challenged the prevailing Advaita Vedanta philosophy of Adi Shankara and established a theistic alternative that emphasized devotion (bhakti) to Vishnu while maintaining philosophical rigor. His revolutionary social reforms included welcoming lower-caste individuals into temples and religious practice, making him a pioneering figure in challenging the rigid caste hierarchies of medieval India. Ramanuja's philosophical works, particularly his commentaries on the Brahma Sutras, Bhagavad Gita, and Upanishads, continue to influence millions of followers in the Sri Vaishnava tradition worldwide.

## Early Life and Background

Ramanuja was born in 1017 CE in Sriperumbudur, a small village near present-day Chennai in Tamil Nadu, into a pious Brahmin family of the Vaishnava tradition[^1]. His father, Asuri Keshava Somayaji, was a respected scholar and temple priest, while his mother, Kantimathi, was known for her devotion to Lord Vishnu[^2]. From an early age, Ramanuja displayed exceptional intellectual abilities and a deep spiritual inclination that set him apart from his peers.

His early education began under his father's guidance, where he mastered Sanskrit, the Vedas, and various religious texts by the age of sixteen[^3]. The young Ramanuja's brilliance attracted the attention of Yadava Prakasha, a renowned Advaita Vedanta scholar in Kanchipuram, under whom he continued his advanced studies[^4]. However, even as a student, Ramanuja began questioning his teacher's monistic interpretations of the Vedic texts, particularly disagreeing with the impersonal conception of the ultimate reality (Brahman) that characterized Advaita philosophy[^5].

A pivotal moment in Ramanuja's early life came when he witnessed the rigid caste discrimination practiced in Hindu society, particularly the exclusion of lower-caste individuals from temple worship and spiritual knowledge[^6]. This experience planted the seeds of his later social reform efforts. His marriage to Tanjammal (also known as Rakshakambal) at a young age was arranged according to custom, though this relationship would later become strained due to his wife's adherence to strict caste practices that conflicted with his inclusive vision[^7].

The death of his father when Ramanuja was still young forced him to take on family responsibilities, but it also freed him to pursue his spiritual calling more intensely[^8]. His intellectual debates with his teacher Yadava Prakasha became increasingly contentious, as Ramanuja consistently offered theistic interpretations of scriptural passages that contradicted the non-dualistic teachings[^9]. According to traditional accounts, his teacher even plotted to kill him during a pilgrimage, but Ramanuja escaped with the help of his cousin Govinda, who was also a disciple of Yadava Prakasha[^10].

This period of his life culminated in his encounter with Kanchipurna (also known as Tirukkacchi Nambi), a devotee of low-caste origin who served at the Varadaraja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram[^11]. Despite the vast social gulf between them, Ramanuja recognized Kanchipurna's spiritual wisdom and sought his guidance, marking the beginning of his challenge to caste-based hierarchies[^12]. The spiritual instruction he received from this humble temple servant profoundly influenced his understanding of devotion transcending social barriers.

## Rise to Prominence

Ramanuja's rise to prominence began in earnest after he moved to Srirangam around 1070 CE, one of the most important Vaishnava pilgrimage centers in South India[^13]. There, he came under the influence of Yamunacharya (Alavandar), the head of the Sri Vaishnava community, though Yamunacharya died before they could meet in person[^14]. According to tradition, when Ramanuja arrived at Yamunacharya's funeral, he noticed three fingers on the deceased master's hand were closed, which he interpreted as three unfulfilled wishes: to write a commentary on the Brahma Sutras from a theistic perspective, to commemorate the Nammazhvars (Tamil Vaishnava saints), and to spread the philosophy of devotion[^15].

Taking these as his life's mission, Ramanuja was eventually initiated into the Sri Vaishnava tradition by Periya Nambi (Mahapurna), who became his primary spiritual teacher[^16]. Under Mahapurna's guidance, Ramanuja underwent rigorous spiritual training and formally renounced worldly life, taking sannyasa (monastic vows) around 1072 CE[^17]. His wife's unwillingness to accept his inclusive social views reportedly contributed to this decision to embrace monasticism[^18].

His reputation as a brilliant philosopher and debater grew rapidly. Ramanuja engaged in numerous philosophical debates with Advaita scholars across South India, systematically presenting his Vishishtadvaita philosophy as a superior interpretation of the Vedantic texts[^19]. His charisma, combined with his philosophical prowess and personal integrity, attracted numerous disciples from all social backgrounds[^20]. Unlike other religious leaders of his time, Ramanuja actively sought to include people from lower castes in his spiritual community, earning him both devoted followers and powerful enemies[^21].

A turning point came when he was appointed as the head of the Srirangam temple and monastery around 1090 CE, succeeding his teacher Mahapurna[^22]. This position gave him institutional authority to implement his reforms and spread his teachings more widely. He reorganized the temple administration, introduced systematic daily worship practices based on the Pancharatra Agamas, and established educational institutions for training priests and scholars[^23].

However, his growing influence brought him into conflict with the Chola king Kulothunga Chola I, a Shaiva (Shiva worshipper) who allegedly persecuted Vaishnavas and demanded that Ramanuja sign a declaration affirming Shiva's supremacy over Vishnu[^24]. Refusing to compromise his beliefs, Ramanuja was forced to flee Srirangam around 1098 CE, beginning a period of exile that would last approximately twenty years[^25]. He found refuge in the Hoysala kingdom in present-day Karnataka, where King Bittideva (later known as Vishnuvardhana) became his patron and convert[^26].

During his exile, Ramanuja's influence expanded into Karnataka and beyond. He is credited with converting King Bittideva to Vaishnavism, leading to the construction of numerous Vaishnava temples throughout the Hoysala kingdom, including the famous Chennakeshava Temple at Belur[^27]. This period saw him traveling extensively, establishing mathas (monasteries), ordaining disciples, and debating with scholars of other schools[^28]. His organizational abilities transformed the Sri Vaishnava community from a regional movement into a pan-Indian religious force with a sophisticated institutional structure.

## Major Achievements

Ramanuja's most enduring achievement was the systematic formulation of Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, a philosophical system that provided a intellectually rigorous alternative to Shankara's Advaita (non-dualism)[^29]. His major philosophical works include the Sri Bhashya (commentary on the Brahma Sutras), Vedartha Sangraha (summary of Vedic teachings), Vedanta Deepa (lamp of Vedanta), Vedanta Sara (essence of Vedanta), and Gita Bhashya (commentary on the Bhagavad Gita)[^30]. These texts established a comprehensive theistic framework that reconciled reason with devotion, arguing that the ultimate reality (Brahman) possesses qualities and attributes, unlike the attributeless Brahman of Advaita philosophy[^31].

His Sri Bhashya, completed over several years, is considered one of the greatest works of Indian philosophy, presenting a detailed critique of Advaita interpretations while offering alternative readings of the Brahma Sutras that support qualified non-dualism[^32]. In this work, Ramanuja argued that individual souls (jivas) and matter (prakriti) are real and distinct, though they exist as modes or attributes of Brahman, much like body and soul[^33]. This philosophy validated both the reality of the world and the distinctiveness of individual souls while maintaining the supremacy of a personal God, providing theological justification for devotional practices[^34].

Ramanuja's integration of the Tamil devotional poetry of the Azhvars (Vaishnava poet-saints) with Sanskrit Vedantic philosophy was revolutionary[^35]. He elevated the Tamil Nalayira Divya Prabandham to the status of the "Tamil Veda," giving vernacular devotional literature equal authority with Sanskrit scriptures[^36]. This linguistic and cultural synthesis helped democratize religious knowledge, making sophisticated theology accessible beyond Sanskrit-educated Brahmin elites[^37].

His social reforms were unprecedented for medieval India. Ramanuja actively challenged caste-based discrimination by admitting people from all castes into his religious community and allowing them temple entry[^38]. He coined the term "Tirukulattar" (those belonging to the holy community) for lower-caste devotees, reframing their social identity in spiritual rather than hereditary terms[^39]. Traditional accounts describe how he personally served food to lower-caste devotees and insisted that spiritual merit, not birth, determined one's religious standing[^40].

The organizational infrastructure he created ensured the survival and spread of Sri Vaishnavism. He established 74 simhasanathipatis (pontiffs) to head monasteries and temples across India, creating a decentralized leadership structure that could withstand persecution[^41]. He systematized temple rituals based on the Pancharatra Agamas, wrote detailed manuals for worship, and established training programs for priests[^42]. These institutional innovations created self-sustaining communities that perpetuated his teachings across generations.

Ramanuja's concept of "Sharanagati" (total surrender to God) provided a practical spiritual path accessible to all, regardless of education or social status[^43]. This teaching emphasized that sincere devotion and surrender to Vishnu were sufficient for salvation, without requiring elaborate rituals or esoteric knowledge[^44]. This democratization of the spiritual path had profound social implications, offering dignity and hope to marginalized communities.

His literary output extended beyond philosophy to devotional works. He composed the Gadya-Traya (three prose poems): Sharanagati Gadya, Sriranga Gadya, and Vaikuntha Gadya, which express intense devotional emotion in elegant Sanskrit prose[^45]. These works demonstrate that intellectual rigor and emotional devotion are complementary rather than contradictory, a synthesis that became characteristic of bhakti movements throughout India.

The propagation of his ideas led to the conversion of several rulers, most notably the Hoysala King Bittideva, whose patronage resulted in magnificent temple architecture and the spread of Vaishnavism in Karnataka[^46]. The temples built during this period, with their distinctive Hoysala architectural style, remain important pilgrimage sites and artistic treasures[^47].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revered status, Ramanuja's life and teachings generated significant controversy, both during his lifetime and in subsequent centuries. His theological positions brought him into sharp conflict with Advaita Vedantins, who viewed his qualified non-dualism as a corruption of Shankara's pure non-dualism[^48]. Advaita scholars criticized his philosophy as being insufficiently monistic and argued that his emphasis on a personal God with qualities contradicted the Upanishadic teaching of nirgun Brahman (attributeless absolute)[^49]. These philosophical disputes sometimes became bitter, with both sides accusing the other of misinterpreting sacred texts.

His social reforms, while progressive, faced fierce resistance from orthodox Brahmins who viewed his inclusion of lower castes as a threat to the established social order[^50]. Historical records suggest that this opposition was not merely theological but also political and economic, as temple authorities feared losing control over religious institutions[^51]. Some scholars argue that despite his inclusive rhetoric, Ramanuja's reforms were limited in scope and did not fundamentally dismantle caste hierarchies, but rather created a parallel hierarchy within the Vaishnava community[^52].

Critical historians have noted that even within Sri Vaishnavism, caste divisions persisted, with the community eventually splitting into the Vadakalai (Northern) and Thenkalai (Southern) sects partly along caste and linguistic lines[^53]. This division, which became formalized in later centuries, suggests that Ramanuja's vision of a casteless devotional community was not fully realized by his followers[^54]. Some scholars contend that his use of the term "Tirukulattar" for lower-caste devotees, while progressive, still maintained a separate category rather than completely abolishing caste distinctions[^55].

His alleged persecution by the Chola king Kulothunga I has been questioned by some modern historians who argue that the historical evidence for this persecution is primarily found in much later hagiographical texts rather than contemporary records[^56]. Skeptics suggest that the persecution narrative may have been exaggerated or even invented by later Sri Vaishnava communities to create a martyrdom story that enhanced Ramanuja's stature[^57]. However, other scholars defend the essential historicity of these accounts, noting that Shaiva-Vaishnava conflicts were documented in the period[^58].

Ramanuja's textual interpretations have been criticized by scholars of other schools as being eisegetical—reading his pre-existing theistic beliefs into texts rather than deriving them from the texts themselves[^59]. His readings of certain Upanishadic passages that Advaita scholars interpret as teaching absolute monism have been called "forced" and "unconvincing" by critics[^60]. Comparative philosophy scholars have noted that his arguments against Advaita sometimes create "straw man" versions of his opponents' positions[^61].

From a feminist perspective, some modern scholars have critiqued the patriarchal elements in Ramanuja's thought and the Sri Vaishnava tradition generally[^62]. Despite his social progressivism regarding caste, the tradition he established maintained conventional gender hierarchies, and women's access to religious leadership remained severely restricted[^63]. His separation from his wife over her caste orthodoxy, while understandable in the context of his inclusive mission, has been viewed by some as abandoning rather than reforming his own household[^64].

Environmental historians have noted that while Ramanuja's philosophy theoretically valued all of creation as part of God's body, the actual practice of Sri Vaishnavism did not develop a strong environmental ethic, focusing instead on temple rituals and devotion[^65]. This represents a potential inconsistency between his philosophical principles and their practical application.

Some secular critics argue that Ramanuja's emphasis on devotion to a personal deity, while psychologically and socially beneficial for many, ultimately reinforced superstitious thinking and dependence on divine intervention rather than human agency and rational problem-solving[^66]. Rationalist scholars in India have critiqued how his teachings, like other religious systems, can be used to justify passivity and acceptance of social inequalities as divinely ordained[^67].

## Personal Life

Ramanuja's personal life was marked by the tension between his social obligations and his spiritual aspirations. His marriage to Tanjammal (Rakshakambal) in his youth was arranged according to Brahmin custom, but the relationship became strained as Ramanuja's inclusive spiritual vision clashed with his wife's orthodox views on caste and ritual purity[^68]. Traditional hagiographies recount several incidents where Tanjammal's strict adherence to caste rules conflicted with Ramanuja's egalitarian practices, including her refusal to accept food touched by lower-caste devotees[^69].

The breaking point allegedly came when Kanchipurna, the low-caste temple servant who had become Ramanuja's spiritual guide, visited their home, and Tanjammal treated him with disrespect due to his caste status[^70]. This incident, combined with his growing conviction that family life was incompatible with his spiritual mission, led Ramanuja to take sannyasa (renunciate vows) around 1072 CE[^71]. He arranged for his wife's financial security before leaving household life, though accounts differ on whether she eventually accepted his decision[^72].

As a sannyasi, Ramanuja lived an austere life dedicated to study, writing, teaching, and temple service. Contemporary accounts describe him as having a commanding presence, with a tall stature and dignified bearing that impressed both followers and opponents[^73]. Despite his renunciate status, he was an effective administrator and organizer, qualities that helped him build the institutional infrastructure of the Sri Vaishnava movement[^74].

His personal relationships with disciples were characterized by deep affection and mutual respect. He had several close disciples who became important teachers in their own right, including Kuresha (Kurattalvan), who allegedly had his eyes gouged out by the Chola king for refusing to sign the declaration of Shiva's supremacy[^75]. Ramanuja's relationship with Kuresha exemplified his loyalty to his followers; he reportedly wept when he learned of his disciple's torture and cared for him personally afterward[^76].

Ramanuja's personality combined intellectual rigor with emotional warmth. While he could be fierce in philosophical debate, defending his positions with formidable logic, he was also known for his compassion and accessibility to common devotees[^77]. Hagiographical accounts emphasize his humility, describing how he would personally clean temples, serve devotees, and perform menial tasks despite his status as a revered teacher[^78].

His daily routine, according to traditional sources, included elaborate worship of the deity, study and teaching of scriptures, composing philosophical works, administrative duties for temples and monasteries, and guiding disciples[^79]. Even in his advanced years during his exile in Karnataka, he maintained a rigorous schedule of teaching and writing[^80].

Ramanuja's relationship with political power was pragmatic. While he never sought political authority for himself, he recognized the importance of royal patronage for protecting and spreading his religious community[^81]. His conversion of the Hoysala king Bittideva demonstrated his ability to work with political leaders to achieve religious goals[^82]. However, he also showed principled resistance to political authority when it conflicted with his convictions, as evidenced by his refusal to submit to the Chola king's demands[^83].

In his final years, after returning to Srirangam following the death of Kulothunga Chola I around 1118 CE, Ramanuja continued teaching and writing until his death in 1137 CE at the age of 120, according to traditional accounts, though modern scholars suggest he likely lived to around 100[^84]. He spent his last years consolidating his philosophical works and ensuring the succession of leadership in the Sri Vaishnava community[^85].

## Legacy

Ramanuja's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, fundamentally shaping Hinduism's development and influencing millions of devotees worldwide. The Sri Vaishnava tradition he established remains one of the most vibrant devotional movements in Hinduism, with major temples in Srirangam, Tirupati, and numerous other pilgrimage sites continuing his practices and teachings[^86]. The Tirupati Venkateswara Temple, one of the world's most visited religious sites, operates according to principles Ramanuja established, demonstrating the enduring institutional impact of his reforms[^87].

His philosophical system, Vishishtadvaita Vedanta, became one of the three major schools of Vedanta alongside Advaita and Dvaita, providing a sophisticated theistic alternative that reconciled devotion with philosophical rigor[^88]. This framework influenced later bhakti movements across India, including those led by Nimbarka, Madhva, Vallabha, and Chaitanya, who all built upon or responded to Ramanuja's synthesis of philosophy and devotion[^89]. His integration of vernacular devotional poetry with Sanskrit philosophy created a model for subsequent regional religious movements that sought to make spirituality accessible beyond elite circles[^90].

The social impact of his teachings on caste, while limited and contested, represented a significant challenge to orthodox Brahminical authority in medieval India. His insistence that spiritual merit transcended birth status provided theological justification for later social reform movements, including those of Basava, Kabir, and the Bhakti saints of medieval India[^91]. Modern social reformers in India, including B.R. Ambedkar and E.V. Ramasamy (Periyar), while critical of traditional Hinduism, acknowledged Ramanuja as a forerunner in challenging caste oppression[^92].

Ramanuja's literary legacy includes not only his philosophical works but also the elevation of Tamil devotional literature to canonical status, strengthening Tamil cultural identity and linguistic pride[^93]. His recognition of the Azhvars' Tamil hymns as equal to Sanskrit Vedas validated vernacular religious expression and contributed to the rich Tamil literary tradition[^94]. This linguistic inclusivity became a model for devotional movements in other Indian languages.

The temple worship practices he systematized based on Pancharatra Agamas became standard in many Vaishnava temples, influencing Hindu ritual practice broadly[^95]. His detailed manuals for worship, consecration of images, and temple administration provided a blueprint that temples across India continue to follow[^96]. The concept of the deity as a gracious lord receiving devotees' offerings, rather than a distant absolute, transformed Hindu worship into a more personal and emotionally engaging practice[^97].

In the modern era, Ramanuja's teachings have spread globally through the Indian diaspora and missionary efforts. Organizations like the Sri Vaishnava Sampradaya have established temples and teaching centers in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia, making his philosophy accessible to international audiences[^98]. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), while following the Gaudiya Vaishnava tradition, acknowledges Ramanuja as an important predecessor in the theistic Vedanta lineage[^99].

Academic interest in Ramanuja has grown significantly, with scholars of comparative philosophy, theology, and religious studies examining his works. His philosophy has been compared to Christian theological concepts, particularly in discussions of panentheism and the relationship between God and creation[^100]. Western philosophers have engaged with his critiques of absolute monism and his arguments for the reality of the phenomenal world, finding relevance to contemporary debates in metaphysics and philosophy of religion[^101].

The Sri Vaishnava community itself, while eventually dividing into Vadakalai and Thenkalai sects with different emphases, continues to revere Ramanuja as their primary acharya (teacher)[^102]. His birthday is celebrated annually by devotees, and his teachings remain central to Sri Vaishnava identity and practice[^103]. The monasteries he established continue to function, maintaining unbroken lineages of teachers tracing their authority back to Ramanuja himself[^104].

His influence on Hindu theological discourse remains profound. Modern Hindu thinkers engaging with questions of God's nature, the problem of evil, the relationship between Brahman and the world, and the value of devotion inevitably reference Ramanuja's arguments[^105]. His systematic approach to reconciling apparently contradictory scriptural passages provided methodological tools that influenced how Hindus interpret their sacred texts[^106].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars of Indian philosophy consistently rank Ramanuja among the greatest systematic thinkers in the Hindu tradition, with some arguing that his Sri Bhashya represents the most sophisticated theistic philosophy in any religious tradition[^107]. Philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan praised Ramanuja as "the most distinguished representative of theism in Indian philosophy," whose thought successfully combined "the rigour of logic with the warmth of devotion"[^108]. Contemporary philosopher Chakravarthi Ram-Prasad argues that Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism offers a more coherent metaphysics than pure non-dualism, avoiding the logical problems inherent in explaining how multiplicity arises from absolute unity[^109].

Religious studies scholars have highlighted Ramanuja's pioneering role in developing a theology of grace that parallels developments in Christian theology, making him a significant figure for comparative religious studies[^110]. Julius Lipner, an expert on Indian theology, describes Ramanuja's concept of God's accessibility to all devotees regardless of social status as "revolutionary" for its time and context[^111]. Scholars of bhakti movements credit Ramanuja with providing the philosophical foundation that legitimized devotional religion, transforming it from folk practice to respectable theology[^112].

Historians of medieval India recognize Ramanuja as a significant social reformer whose challenge to caste hierarchies, though incomplete, represented genuine progressivism in an oppressive social system[^113]. A.K. Ramanujan, the noted scholar, praised his namesake for creating "a community of devotion that cut across caste lines," even if this vision was imperfectly realized[^114]. Dalit scholars, while critical of limitations, acknowledge that Ramanuja's theological arguments against caste-based discrimination provided resources that later reformers could build upon[^115].

Tamil scholars celebrate Ramanuja for elevating Tamil devotional literature to canonical status, strengthening Tamil cultural identity at a time when Sanskrit dominated religious discourse[^116]. His integration of the Azhvars' poetry into Vedantic philosophy is seen as a crucial moment in validating regional languages and cultures within the broader Hindu tradition[^117]. Literary historians credit him with fostering a synthesis of Sanskrit and Tamil religious traditions that enriched both[^118].

Contemporary theologians in the Vaishnava tradition view Ramanuja's concept of the soul's eternal relationship with God as providing a framework for understanding human dignity and purpose that remains relevant today[^119]. His emphasis on God's love and accessibility offers a counterbalance to more austere and impersonal spiritual paths, meeting deep human needs for connection and meaning[^120]. Devotional practitioners find in his teachings a spirituality that engages the whole person—intellect, emotion, and will—rather than privileging abstract meditation alone[^121].

Comparative philosophers have found in Ramanuja's arguments against absolute monism important parallels to Western critiques of idealism, suggesting that his philosophy addresses perennial philosophical problems in innovative ways[^122]. His arguments for the reality of the phenomenal world and individual souls resonate with contemporary concerns about valuing embodied existence and personal identity[^123]. Some process theologians have noted similarities between Ramanuja's panentheism and their own conceptions of God's relationship to the world[^124].

---

### Negative Views

Advaita Vedanta scholars have consistently criticized Ramanuja's philosophy as failing to achieve the highest non-dual realization, arguing that his qualified non-dualism remains trapped in dualistic thinking that prevents genuine liberation[^125]. Modern Advaita teachers like Swami Dayananda Saraswati have argued that Ramanuja's critiques of Shankara misrepresent Advaita philosophy and that his own position collapses into either dualism or monism when examined closely[^126]. Philosophical critics contend that Ramanuja's attempt to maintain both unity and real distinctions results in logical inconsistencies that his system cannot resolve[^127].

Secular scholars and rationalist critics argue that Ramanuja's theistic philosophy, despite its intellectual sophistication, ultimately perpetuates supernatural beliefs unsupported by evidence and encourages dependency on divine intervention rather than human agency[^128]. Critics in the tradition of Indian rationalism, such as followers of the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu, view his religious philosophy as maintaining Brahminical authority under a veneer of inclusivity[^129]. They argue that his challenge to caste was superficial and that Sri Vaishnavism in practice maintained hierarchies and ritual exclusions[^130].

Dalit scholars and activists have offered mixed assessments, with some arguing that Ramanuja's reforms were primarily motivated by the desire to expand his sect's influence rather than genuine concern for the oppressed[^131]. They point to the persistence of caste discrimination within Sri Vaishnava communities as evidence that his teachings did not fundamentally challenge Brahminical supremacy[^132]. Ambedkarite scholars note that unlike Buddha, who explicitly rejected the Vedas and caste system, Ramanuja sought to reform from within, ultimately preserving rather than dismantling oppressive structures[^133].

Feminist scholars have criticized the patriarchal elements in Ramanuja's thought and practice, noting that his progressive views on caste did not extend to gender equality[^134]. The Sri Vaishnava tradition he established maintained strict gender hierarchies, excluding women from religious leadership and higher theological education[^135]. Some feminists view his abandonment of his wife, regardless of the spiritual justification, as emblematic of how male renunciation often depended on women's unpaid labor and social subordination[^136].

Historians skeptical of hagiographical sources question many traditional accounts of Ramanuja's life, arguing that the persecution narratives, miracle stories, and some biographical details are likely later inventions designed to enhance his reputation[^137]. They contend that separating historical fact from devotional legend in Ramanuja's biography is extremely difficult, making definitive historical claims problematic[^138]. This scholarly skepticism extends to evaluating the actual extent of his social reforms and philosophical innovations versus what was attributed to him by later followers[^139].

Critics from other Hindu philosophical schools, particularly Dvaita Vedantins following Madhva, argue that Ramanuja's qualified non-dualism is philosophically unstable, satisfying neither pure monists nor pure dualists[^140]. They contend that his attempts to maintain real distinctions between God, souls, and matter while insisting on their ultimate unity creates more problems than it solves[^141]. Some Dvaita scholars argue that Ramanuja's philosophy illogically tries to combine incompatible positions and should be abandoned in favor of clear dualism[^142].

Environmental ethicists have noted that despite Ramanuja's philosophy viewing the world as God's body, which could support environmental concern, the Sri Vaishnava tradition in practice focused on temple rituals rather than ecological responsibility[^143]. This represents a failure to develop the practical implications of his philosophical principles for human relationships with nature[^144].

Comparative religionists who emphasize mystical experience over theological doctrine sometimes view Ramanuja's elaborate philosophical system as intellectualizing what should remain ineffable, arguing that systematic theology can become an obstacle to direct spiritual realization[^145]. They suggest that his criticisms of Advaita's mystical non-dualism in favor of devotional theism may have closed off valuable spiritual paths for those not temperamentally suited to bhakti practice[^146].
