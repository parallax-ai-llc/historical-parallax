## Summary

Sunan Giri (1442–1506), born Raden Paku and also known as Muhammad Ainul Yakin or Prabu Satmata, was one of the most influential members of the Wali Songo (Nine Saints) who spread Islam across Java and the Indonesian archipelago during the 15th and 16th centuries.[^1][^2] Founder of Giri Kedaton, an Islamic principality near Gresik in East Java, Sunan Giri became the leader of the Wali Songo in 1478 and served as mufti (supreme religious authority) throughout Java, wielding power comparable to that of the Pope in medieval Europe.[^3][^4] Through innovative cultural adaptation, educational excellence, and political astuteness, he transformed Islamic education in Indonesia and established a dynasty that spread Islam to Lombok, Sulawesi, Maluku, and beyond, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to shape Indonesian Islamic practice today.[^5][^6]

## Early Life and Background

Sunan Giri was born in 1442 CE in Blambangan (present-day Banyuwangi) in East Java, the result of a marriage between Maulana Ishak of Melaka—brother of the renowned Maulana Malik Ibrahim—and Dewi Sekardadu (also called Dewi Sabodi), daughter of Prabu Menak Sembuyu, the Hindu ruler of Blambangan during the final days of the Majapahit Empire.[^7][^8] This union between an Islamic missionary from Malaka and a Hindu princess symbolized the complex religious transition occurring in Java during this period. The circumstances of his birth, however, were marked by tragedy and superstition.

At the time of Sunan Giri's birth, the region of Blambangan was struck by a devastating plague.[^9] Patih Bajul Sengata, an advisor to the king, accused the newborn infant of being the cause of the epidemic and advised Prabu Menak Sembuyu to kill the child.[^10] Bowing to pressure from his court and populace, the king ordered that the baby be placed in a chest and set adrift at sea—a narrative strikingly reminiscent of the biblical story of Moses.[^11] This event was later documented by Thomas Stamford Raffles in his seminal work "History of Java" and confirmed by Dutch scholars H.J. De Graaf and Th. Pigeaud in their book "Kerajaan-Kerajaan Islam di Jawa Peralihan dari Majapahit ke Mataram."[^12]

The infant was rescued at sea between Blambangan and Gili Manuk by a crew member named Abu Hurairoh, who served aboard a merchant vessel owned by Nyai Gede Pinatih, a wealthy widow and former wife of Koja Mahdum Syahbandar from Gresik.[^13][^14] Nyai Gede Pinatih adopted the child and gave him the name Joko Samudro (meaning "child of the ocean"), as his original name Raden Paku was not yet known to her.[^15] Under her care, the boy grew up in Gresik, a major port city that served as a crucial hub for Islamic trade and cultural exchange in the Indonesian archipelago.

At the age of seven, young Joko Samudro was sent to study at the pesantren (Islamic boarding school) of Sunan Ampel in Surabaya, the most prestigious center of Islamic learning in East Java.[^16][^17] Sunan Ampel, who belonged to the earlier generation of Wali Songo, recognized the exceptional intelligence and spiritual potential of his young student and bestowed upon him the title "Maulana Ainul Yaqin" (meaning "Spring of Certainty").[^18] At Sunan Ampel's pesantren, young Giri studied alongside Raden Patah, who would later found the Demak Sultanate, the first Islamic kingdom in Java.[^19] Sunan Ampel trained Giri extensively in Ilmu Tasawuf (Sufi mysticism), Islamic jurisprudence, theology, and the art of dakwah (Islamic preaching).[^20] This rigorous education laid the foundation for Giri's later innovations in Islamic pedagogy and cultural adaptation. Cementing his ties to the Wali Songo leadership, he eventually married the daughter of Sunan Ampel, making him the son-in-law of one of Java's most revered Islamic scholars.[^21]

## Rise to Power

Following his extensive training under Sunan Ampel, Sunan Giri sought to establish his own center for Islamic learning and propagation. He found suitable land on a hilltop in Sidomukti Village in southern Gresik, East Java, where the elevated terrain provided both strategic advantage and symbolic significance.[^22] It was from this location—"giri" meaning "hill" in Javanese—that he derived his famous title, Sunan Giri.[^23] Around 1481, with the blessing of the king of Majapahit who granted him authority to expand his role in political leadership, Sunan Giri established what would become known as Giri Kedaton, both an Islamic educational center and a nascent political entity.[^24][^25]

The founding of Giri Kedaton occurred during a period of tremendous political and religious transformation in Java. The Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire was in decline, and Islamic kingdoms were emerging along the northern coast of Java. In 1478, when Sunan Ampel passed away, Sunan Giri was chosen to succeed him as the leader of the Wali Songo, assuming the prestigious title of Prabu Satmata—one of the names of Lord Shiva in Javanese tradition, demonstrating the syncretic approach that characterized early Javanese Islam.[^26][^27] This title reflected his remarkable spiritual authority and his ability to bridge Islamic and Javanese cultural traditions.

Sunan Giri's rise to prominence was closely intertwined with the establishment of the Demak Sultanate by his fellow student Raden Patah around 1475.[^28] When Demak declared independence in 1478, it was temporarily led by Sunan Giri (using his title Prabu Satmoto) before full governmental structures were established.[^29] After Raden Patah's forces attacked and conquered the remnants of Majapahit power, Sunan Giri occupied the Majapahit throne for 40 days to neutralize the influence of the old Hindu-Buddhist religion and facilitate the transition to Islamic governance.[^30] This symbolic act demonstrated his unique position as both spiritual leader and political power broker.

In recognition of his supreme religious authority, Raden Patah appointed Sunan Giri as mufti of the new Demak Sultanate, making him the highest religious authority in the kingdom, while other Wali Songo members received different positions—Sunan Kudus became qadi (great judge of religious law), and Sunan Kalijaga became imam and advisor.[^31][^32] The power and influence of Sunan Giri at this time has been compared to that of the Pope in medieval Europe, as Dutch contemporaries during the early 17th century referred to the Sunans of Giri as the "Moorish Popes" or "Islamic Popes."[^33][^34] This comparison was particularly apt because Javanese society adhered to the principle of divine power—the belief that legitimate authority descended from God—and Sunan Giri's unique religious standing meant that almost all important events related to changes in leadership at Islamic kingdoms throughout Java had to be legitimized at Giri Kedaton.[^35]

By 1487, Sunan Giri formally established Giri Kedaton as a kingdom in its own right, and he ruled as its first king from 1487 to 1506 CE.[^36][^37] The kingdom controlled Gresik and its surrounding territories, positioning itself as both a religious center and a political power. Because of the strong legitimacy conferred by Giri Kedaton, prospective sultans from Demak, Pajang, and early Mataram sought validation from Sunan Giri before taking up their positions, ensuring the continuity of Islamic authority in the region.[^38]

## Major Achievements

### Establishment of Pesantren Giri

Sunan Giri's most enduring achievement was the establishment of Pesantren Giri, which became the model for Islamic education throughout the Indonesian archipelago and one of the most influential educational institutions in Southeast Asian Islamic history.[^39][^40] The pesantren was not merely an institute of religious studies but served as a comprehensive center for civic activities, social development, and political leadership.[^41] Giri Kedaton attracted students from all corners of the Nusantara (Indonesian archipelago) as well as international students from China, Europe, Egypt, and the Arab world, making it a truly cosmopolitan center of Islamic learning.[^42]

The educational methodology employed at Pesantren Giri was innovative and multifaceted, incorporating various pedagogical approaches that would influence Indonesian Islamic education for centuries. The methods included the Wetonan system (where a teacher recites and explains religious texts while students listen and take notes), the Sorogan method (individualized instruction where students recite texts to the teacher), discussion and questioning sessions, problem-solving exercises, dakwah bil-hal (preaching through action and example), practical learning experiences, learning while working, socio-dramas and performances, educational games, and macapat singing (traditional Javanese poetry set to music).[^43][^44] This comprehensive approach combined traditional Islamic scholarship with Javanese cultural forms and practical skill development, creating a uniquely Indonesian Islamic educational model.

### Cultural Adaptation and Innovation

Perhaps Sunan Giri's most significant innovation was his systematic adaptation of Javanese cultural elements to make Islam more accessible and appealing to the local population.[^45] Understanding that rigid rejection of Javanese traditions would hinder Islamic acceptance, he instead transformed these cultural practices to align with Islamic principles while preserving their familiar forms.

Most notably, Sunan Giri redesigned the traditional Javanese wayang (shadow puppet) theater to make it compatible with Islamic teachings.[^46] Traditional wayang puppets represented Hindu deities and heroes in realistic human forms, which conflicted with Islamic proscriptions against depicting the human form. According to historical accounts, Sunan Giri created wayang kancil at the end of the 15th century, featuring animal characters—particularly the clever mouse deer (kancil)—drawn from stories in the Hitopadeça and Tantri Kamandaka collections, with humorous elements useful for children's education.[^47][^48] He also supposedly created wayang gedog around 1553 to tell stories of Prince Panji, using stylized, unrealistic puppet designs that circumvented Islamic prohibitions while maintaining the theatrical traditions beloved by Javanese audiences.[^49][^50] These adaptations allowed Islamic teachings to be embedded within familiar entertainment forms, making religious education more engaging and culturally resonant.

Sunan Giri also created numerous traditional Javanese children's games and songs that incorporated Islamic moral teachings, including Jelungan, Jamuran, Gendi Gerit, and the famous Cublak-Cublak Suweng.[^51][^52] These games were not mere entertainment but sophisticated pedagogical tools. For example, the game Jelungan involves children being chased by a "hunter" while trying to reach safety by touching a pole or tree trunk.[^53] The hunter symbolizes Satan or the devil, the children represent humanity, and the safe pole represents Islam—teaching that one must hold firmly to Islamic faith to be protected from temptation.[^54] The song Cublak-Cublak Suweng conveys the message that true wealth and riches come from happiness and spiritual contentment rather than material possessions.[^55] Children's songs he created include Padang Bulan, Jor, and Gula Ganti, all incorporating Islamic life principles through familiar Javanese artistic forms.[^56]

### Political and Religious Leadership

As the supreme religious authority (mufti) of Java, Sunan Giri exercised extraordinary influence over the political landscape of the region.[^57] His role in legitimizing rulers meant that he effectively controlled the religious validation necessary for political authority in the Islamic kingdoms of Java. This system ensured that Islamic values and legal principles were integrated into governance structures and that rulers maintained accountability to religious standards.

Sunan Giri's vision extended far beyond Java. He foretold the rise of the Mataram Sultanate, demonstrating his understanding of regional political dynamics.[^58] He personally spread Islam to Lombok, Sulawesi, and Maluku, establishing networks that would expand Islamic influence throughout eastern Indonesia.[^59] The reach of his teaching extended across Java, Madura, Lombok, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Maluku, creating a vast network of students and satellite institutions that propagated his educational methods and religious interpretations.[^60]

### Dynasty of Islamic Expansion

The achievements of Giri Kedaton continued and even intensified under Sunan Giri's successors, particularly his grandson Sunan Prapen, who served as the fourth king of Giri Kedaton from 1548 to 1605 and presided over its golden age.[^61][^62] Under Sunan Prapen's leadership, Giri Kedaton became the epicenter for the propagation of Islam to the outer islands of the Indonesian archipelago, particularly Lombok, Celebes (Sulawesi), Borneo (Kalimantan), and the Moluccas (Maluku).[^63][^64] Sunan Prapen stationed troops from Giri in Maluku for three years to counter Portuguese attacks and protect the region from European colonization attempts.[^65] Islamic kings in eastern Indonesian regions such as Kalimantan, Lombok, and Maluku received blessings and legitimization from Sunan Prapen during their inaugurations, continuing the political-religious authority established by Sunan Giri.[^66]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Theological Conservatism

While Sunan Giri is celebrated for his cultural adaptations, some sources indicate that he was simultaneously a proponent of orthodox Islam who disapproved of innovation (bid'ah), much like "modernist" Islamic scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries.[^67] This apparent paradox—adapting cultural forms while maintaining theological orthodoxy—suggests a nuanced approach where external cultural expressions could be modified to serve Islamic purposes, but core religious doctrines and practices must remain pure and unchanged. This conservative theological stance may have created tensions with those who favored either more syncretistic approaches or more radical breaks with Javanese traditions.

### Birth Circumstances and Superstition

The circumstances surrounding Sunan Giri's birth reveal the deep-seated superstitions and potentially xenophobic attitudes toward change in 15th-century Javanese society. The accusation that a newborn infant caused a plague epidemic and the subsequent decision to kill the child by casting him into the sea demonstrates the precarious position of early Islamic figures in predominantly Hindu-Buddhist communities.[^68][^69] While these events ultimately contributed to Sunan Giri's mystique and the miraculous narrative surrounding his survival, they also highlight the resistance and danger that accompanied religious transformation in Java.

### Political Power and Dynastic Ambition

Sunan Giri's establishment of Giri Kedaton as both a religious center and a political kingdom raises questions about the relationship between spiritual authority and temporal power. Unlike purely religious figures who eschewed political involvement, Sunan Giri actively cultivated political influence, ruling as a king and requiring other rulers to seek legitimization from his court.[^70] Critics might argue that this conflation of religious and political authority created opportunities for the abuse of spiritual prestige for political gain, a concern that has been raised about religious establishments throughout history.

### Downfall of Giri Kedaton

The ultimate fate of Giri Kedaton also reveals limitations in Sunan Giri's political legacy. In 1630, long after Sunan Giri's death, Giri Kedaton under the leadership of Sunan Kawis Guwa rejected the rule of the powerful Mataram Sultanate led by Sultan Agung.[^71] This rebellion involved people unwilling to submit to Mataram's authority, but Giri's religious prestige initially made Mataram officers reluctant to attack.[^72] Sultan Agung cleverly assigned his brother-in-law, Pangeran Pekik—a descendant of Sunan Ampel and therefore religiously legitimate—to suppress the rebellion.[^73][^74] The strategy worked, as Mataram troops rallied behind someone with his own Wali Songo lineage. By around 1636, Mataram won the war, and while Sunan Kawis Guwa was allowed to continue leading Giri on the condition of submission to Mataram, the prestige and independence of Giri Kedaton faded dramatically.[^75][^76] This defeat demonstrated that religious authority, however powerful, could ultimately be subordinated to superior military and political force.

### Limited Historical Documentation

Much of what is known about Sunan Giri comes from later hagiographic accounts, oral traditions, and semi-legendary narratives that blend historical facts with miraculous elements. The story of his birth and rescue at sea, while documented by colonial scholars like Raffles, has mythological qualities that make it difficult to separate historical reality from religious legend. This limited and sometimes contradictory documentation makes it challenging for modern scholars to fully assess Sunan Giri's actual teachings, methods, and impact versus what later traditions attributed to him.

## Personal Life

Sunan Giri married the daughter of his teacher and mentor, Sunan Ampel, creating a family alliance between two of the most important Wali Songo lineages.[^77] This marriage strengthened his position within the Wali Songo leadership network and demonstrated the importance of family connections in establishing religious authority in Javanese Islamic society. The union also symbolized the transmission of Islamic knowledge and authority from the older generation of Wali Songo (represented by Sunan Ampel) to the next generation (represented by Sunan Giri and his contemporaries).

Sunan Giri had multiple children who continued his mission and maintained the dynasty of Giri Kedaton. His son, Syekh Maulana Zainal Abidin (also known as Sunan Dalem), succeeded him and fathered Sunan Prapen, who would lead Giri Kedaton to its greatest heights.[^78] The family tomb complex at Giri contains around 300 graves, including those of Sunan Giri's foster mother Nyai Gede Pinatih, his wives, and his sons, demonstrating the extensive family network that supported the Giri Kedaton dynasty.[^79]

Despite his political power as a king and supreme religious authority, Sunan Giri maintained his identity as an educator and spiritual guide. He personally taught students at his pesantren and remained actively engaged in the intellectual and spiritual development of his community. His teachings emphasized the importance of self-knowledge as a path to understanding God, with one of his famous maxims stating: "Those who know the essence of God are those who know themselves; those who do not yet understand themselves do not yet understand the essence of God."[^80] This focus on introspection and spiritual development reflected his Sufi training under Sunan Ampel.

Another teaching emphasized the impermanence of worldly status: "The state of the world is not permanent, therefore do not boast about wealth and status, as times can change, and one should not be ashamed."[^81] This counsel reflected both Sufi detachment from material concerns and practical wisdom about the volatile political landscape of 15th-century Java. Having witnessed the collapse of Majapahit and the rise of new Islamic kingdoms, Sunan Giri understood the transitory nature of earthly power—a lesson that would be vindicated when his own dynasty eventually lost its independence to Mataram.

Sunan Giri's adoption by Nyai Gede Pinatih, a wealthy female merchant, also shaped his worldview and approach. Growing up in a commercial port city like Gresik exposed him to diverse cultures, languages, and religious traditions, fostering the cosmopolitan outlook that characterized his educational philosophy and missionary work. His foster mother's influence may have contributed to his practical, adaptive approach to spreading Islam through cultural forms rather than rigid imposition of foreign practices.

## Legacy

### Educational Model

Sunan Giri's most enduring legacy is the pesantren educational model he developed, which became the template for Islamic education throughout Indonesia and remains influential today.[^82] The combination of traditional Islamic scholarship with Javanese cultural elements, practical skills, and moral education created an educational system that was distinctly Indonesian while remaining authentically Islamic. Modern Islamic boarding schools (pesantren) across Indonesia still employ variations of the teaching methods pioneered at Pesantren Giri, including the wetonan and sorogan systems.[^83]

Several educational institutions bear his name, including Institut Agama Islam Sunan Giri (INSURI) in Ponorogo, East Java, and Universitas Islam Negeri Sunan Ampel in Surabaya (named after his teacher), demonstrating the continued reverence for the Wali Songo educational tradition.[^84][^85] These institutions conduct research on Islamic education methods, publish academic journals, and continue to develop pedagogical approaches rooted in the principles established by Sunan Giri and his generation.

### Cultural Synthesis

Sunan Giri's approach to cultural adaptation—preserving familiar forms while transforming their content to align with Islamic values—established a pattern for Indonesian Islam that distinguishes it from Islamic practice in the Middle East or South Asia. His innovations in wayang performance, traditional games, and children's songs created a uniquely Javanese Islamic culture that could be both authentically Muslim and recognizably Javanese.[^86][^87] This cultural synthesis made Islam more accessible to ordinary Javanese people and reduced the social disruption that often accompanies religious conversion.

The wayang kulit shadow puppet theater, adapted by Sunan Giri and other Wali Songo, became a key tool for converting Indonesians to Islam and remains an important cultural form in contemporary Indonesia.[^88] The traditional children's games he created, such as Jelungan, Jamuran, and Cublak-Cublak Suweng, continue to be played in some Javanese communities, keeping alive the pedagogical methods he pioneered.[^89][^90]

### Political Model of Religious Authority

Sunan Giri established a model of religious authority in Indonesian Islam where scholars and spiritual leaders could wield significant political influence without necessarily holding direct governmental power. The system of religious legitimization he created—where rulers sought validation from religious authorities—influenced Indonesian political culture for centuries and created expectations that political leaders would be accountable to Islamic values and institutions.

### Geographic Expansion of Islam

Through his own missionary work and the expansion conducted by his successors, particularly Sunan Prapen, Sunan Giri's influence extended far beyond Java to Madura, Lombok, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Maluku.[^91][^92] This geographic expansion established Islam in regions that might otherwise have remained Hindu-Buddhist or animist, fundamentally shaping the religious composition of modern Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim-majority nation.

### Pilgrimage Site

Sunan Giri's tomb in Gresik has become one of the most important pilgrimage sites (ziarah) in Indonesia, particularly for Muslims in Java and surrounding islands.[^93][^94] Located atop a hill requiring pilgrims to climb 104 stairs, the tomb complex attracts visitors from across Indonesia who seek blessings, spiritual guidance, and connection to the Wali Songo heritage.[^95][^96] The tomb is housed in a traditional wooden joglo-style structure reflecting classic Javanese architecture and is surrounded by approximately 300 graves of Sunan Giri's family members and associates.[^97][^98] This pilgrimage tradition, which continues centuries after his death, demonstrates the enduring spiritual significance of Sunan Giri in Indonesian Islamic practice.

### The Wali Songo Legacy

As leader of the Wali Songo from 1478 until his death in 1506, Sunan Giri helped coordinate the efforts of Java's nine great Islamic saints during a crucial period of Islamization.[^99] The collective legacy of the Wali Songo—whose graves are venerated across Java in locations including Surabaya, Gresik, Lamongan, Demak, Kudus, Muria, and Cirebon—represents a distinctive Indonesian Islamic identity that balances orthodoxy with cultural adaptation.[^100][^101] Sunan Giri's leadership during this formative period helped establish the cooperative, culturally adaptive approach that would characterize Indonesian Islam.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars recognize Sunan Giri as one of the most innovative and influential figures in Southeast Asian Islamic history. His educational methodology is praised for its comprehensiveness, cultural sensitivity, and effectiveness in transmitting Islamic knowledge while preserving valuable aspects of Javanese culture.[^102] Researchers studying the methods of Pesantren Giri note that the institution created a conducive educational environment that made the pesantren a progressive and productive educational center, serving as a model for Islamic education throughout the archipelago.[^103]

Academic research emphasizes Sunan Giri's genius in cultural adaptation, particularly his transformation of wayang puppetry and creation of educational games.[^104][^105] Scholars note that by inserting Islamic life principles through familiar artistic performances and childhood activities, he made Islamic teachings accessible to all levels of Javanese society, from children to adults, from common people to nobility. This approach is seen as demonstrating sophisticated understanding of pedagogy and cultural psychology.

Islamic educators and religious scholars praise Sunan Giri's ability to maintain Islamic orthodoxy while adapting external forms, seeing this as a model for how Islam can be authentically practiced in diverse cultural contexts without requiring wholesale abandonment of local traditions.[^106] His emphasis on Sufi spirituality, self-knowledge, and moral development is valued as providing depth and substance to Islamic practice beyond mere ritual observance.

Historians note Sunan Giri's crucial role in the political transition from Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit to Islamic kingdoms, particularly his legitimization of the Demak Sultanate and subsequent Islamic polities.[^107][^108] His 40-day occupation of the Majapahit throne is seen as a symbolic but effective way of transferring religious authority and facilitating a relatively peaceful religious transition that might otherwise have been more violent and disruptive.

The geographic reach of Sunan Giri's influence, extending from Java to the eastern archipelago, is recognized as having fundamentally shaped the religious geography of modern Indonesia. Contemporary scholars studying Islamic expansion in Indonesia acknowledge that without the foundational work of Sunan Giri and the Wali Songo, Islam might not have become the dominant religion of the archipelago.[^109][^110]

### Negative Views

Some contemporary Islamic reformers and modernists criticize aspects of the syncretic traditions associated with Sunan Giri and the Wali Songo, particularly the veneration of their tombs and the attribution of miraculous powers to them.[^111] More puritanical Islamic movements view pilgrimage to saints' tombs as bordering on shirk (polytheism) and argue that the cultural adaptations pioneered by Sunan Giri allowed too many pre-Islamic practices to persist within Indonesian Islam. These critics prefer a more Arabized form of Islamic practice that they view as purer and more aligned with original Islamic teachings.

Historical critics point to the concentration of religious and political power in Giri Kedaton as potentially problematic, arguing that the requirement for rulers to seek legitimization from Sunan Giri created a form of religious authority that could be exploited or that might stifle legitimate political leadership.[^112] The eventual defeat of Giri Kedaton by Mataram is sometimes interpreted as demonstrating the limitations and ultimate failure of the religious-political model Sunan Giri established.

Some scholars question the historical accuracy of accounts about Sunan Giri, noting that many details come from hagiographic sources that blend history with legend.[^113] The miraculous elements of his birth story, his attributed supernatural abilities, and the precise details of his teachings and innovations may be later embellishments rather than historical facts. This creates uncertainty about what Sunan Giri actually accomplished versus what later generations attributed to him.

Feminist scholars might critique the patriarchal structures of authority evident in Sunan Giri's system, where religious and political leadership was exclusively male despite his own upbringing by the female merchant Nyai Gede Pinatih, who clearly possessed significant economic power and agency. The creation of religious institutions that excluded women from leadership roles perpetuated gender hierarchies that remain influential in Indonesian Islam.

Post-colonial scholars sometimes view the Wali Songo, including Sunan Giri, as agents of cultural imperialism who replaced indigenous Javanese religious traditions with a foreign religion, even if they adapted that religion's external forms. From this perspective, the Islamization of Java represents a loss of indigenous cultural and spiritual traditions, and the syncretism praised by others is seen as merely softening the blow of cultural colonization rather than genuinely preserving Javanese heritage.
