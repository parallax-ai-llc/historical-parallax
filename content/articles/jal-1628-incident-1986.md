## Summary

In November 1986, the crew of a Japanese Boeing 747 cargo freighter witnessed three unidentified objects over Alaska. Captain **Kenju Terauchi** reported two small craft and one massive **"mothership"** (twice the size of an aircraft carrier) that shadowed his plane for 50 minutes.

The incident is crucial because the objects were tracked by both ground radar and airborne military radar, and the FAA initially confirmed the data before later retracting it. FAA Division Chief **John Callahan** later blew the whistle, claiming the CIA confiscated the data and told everyone "this event never happened."[^1]

## The Incident

### First Contact (5:11 PM)
Flying over eastern Alaska, Captain Terauchi saw two small lights pacing the 747.
*   **Description:** They were square/rectangular with glowing nozzles. They moved instantaneously, defying inertia.
*   **Heat:** The crew felt warmth on their faces from the lights.

### The Mothership
As the small craft left, a pale white light appeared behind them.
*   **Radar:** Anchorage ATC confirmed a primary target following JAL 1628.
*   **Visual:** Terauchi saw a silhouette of a gigantic sphere or "walnut" shaped craft, estimating it to be "two aircraft carriers" in size.
*   **Evasive Action:** Terauchi requested a 360-degree turn to shake it. The object followed the turn perfectly.[^2]

## The Cover-Up

### John Callahan
FAA Chief of Accidents John Callahan secured the radar tapes and audio. He briefed President Reagan's scientific staff.
*   **The Meeting:** According to Callahan, the CIA checked the data and then confiscated it, swearing everyone to secrecy to avoid "public panic."
*   **Disclosure:** Callahan kept copies of the tapes and audio in his personal stash, releasing them years later.[^3]
