## Summary

Byron Katie is an American author and spiritual teacher who developed 'The Work,' a method of self-inquiry consisting of four questions and turnarounds. After a transformative experience in 1986 that ended a decade of depression, she began sharing her process of questioning stressful thoughts. Her book Loving What Is became a bestseller. Her approach, while not tied to any religion, resonates with Buddhist and Advaita teachings on the nature of suffering.
