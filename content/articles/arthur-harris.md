## Summary

Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Arthur Travers Harris, 1st Baronet (1892-1984), known as "Bomber" Harris, served as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command from February 1942 until the end of World War II[^1]. He was the principal architect of the strategic area bombing campaign against German cities, orchestrating operations that dropped over 850,000 tons of bombs and killed an estimated 600,000 German civilians[^2]. Harris remains one of the most controversial military figures of the Second World War, celebrated by some as a hero who helped defeat Nazi Germany and condemned by others as a war criminal who deliberately targeted civilian populations[^3]. His unflinching advocacy for mass area bombing and his refusal to express remorse for civilian casualties have made him a deeply divisive figure in military history[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Arthur Travers Harris was born on April 13, 1892, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, where his parents were staying while his father, George Steel Travers Harris, was on home leave from India[^5]. George worked as a government engineer and architect in Gwalior, India, while his mother was Caroline Maria Elliot[^6]. The family returned to India shortly after Arthur's birth, where he remained with his parents until the age of five, when they sent him back to England to receive his education—a common practice among British colonial families at the time[^7].

Harris spent twelve years separated from his parents during his formative years, a circumstance that may have contributed to his stern, emotionally reserved character in later life[^8]. He attended kindergarten in Cheltenham before moving to preparatory school in Slough, where he studied alongside his brothers Murray and Frederick and two cousins[^9]. He subsequently attended Allhallows Grammar School in Honiton, receiving a public school education typical of his social class[^10].

At eighteen, Harris fell out with his parents over their wish that he would pursue a military career in the British Army[^11]. Rejecting their plans, he made the bold decision to emigrate to Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) in early 1910, seeking to make his own fortune[^12]. In Rhodesia, Harris tried his hand at various occupations, working as a gold prospector and cattle breeder in the harsh African frontier[^13]. This period of independence and self-reliance in a challenging environment would shape his character, instilling in him a toughness and determination that would define his military career[^14].

When World War I broke out in 1914, Harris was quick to answer the call to arms, signing up with the 1st Rhodesia Regiment[^15]. He first saw action in the Southern African theater, helping to take on German forces in what is now Namibia[^16]. This early military experience gave him his first taste of combat and began his transformation from colonial adventurer to professional soldier[^17].

## Rise to Power

In 1915, Harris returned to England to fight in the European theater of the war, making a decision that would alter the course of his life[^18]. In November 1915, he joined the Royal Flying Corps (RFC), the precursor to the Royal Air Force, undergoing pilot training at Brooklands and qualifying on January 29, 1916[^19]. Harris learned to fly during the infancy of military aviation, when aircraft were primitive and casualty rates among pilots were extraordinarily high[^20].

Having been confirmed in his rank, Harris went on to serve with distinction on the home front and in France during 1917 as a flight commander and ultimately commanding officer of No. 45 Squadron, flying the Sopwith 1½ Strutter and the legendary Sopwith Camel[^21]. Before he returned to Britain to command No. 44 Squadron on Home Defence duties, Harris claimed five enemy aircraft destroyed and was awarded the Air Force Cross (AFC) on November 2, 1918[^22]. He finished the Great War with the rank of major[^23].

Harris made the critical decision to remain in the newly formed Royal Air Force following the end of World War I, choosing an air force career over a return to Rhodesia[^24]. His decision was influenced by practical considerations: he and his first wife Barbara had just had their first child, and he did not think Barbara would enjoy being a Rhodesian farmer's wife[^25]. On April 26, 1920, he took over command of No. 3 Flying Training School at Digby[^26].

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Harris remained in the Air Force, serving in India, Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Palestine, and elsewhere in the British Empire[^27]. After a short posting to India, Harris took command of a squadron in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) in 1922, serving there for two and a half years and gaining experience in colonial air policing operations[^28]. After his return from Iraq to the UK in October 1924 and completion of a staff training course, he was posted to command the first postwar heavy bomber squadron (No. 58, equipped with the Vickers Virginia) in May 1925[^29].

Harris's career progressed steadily through the interwar period. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire on June 3, 1927, and promoted to wing commander on July 1, 1927[^30]. From 1927 to 1929, Harris attended the prestigious Army Staff College at Camberley, where he developed his understanding of military strategy and planning[^31]. On July 2, 1937, Harris was promoted to air commodore, and in 1938 he was put in command of No. 4 (Bomber) Group[^32]. After a purchasing mission to the United States, he was posted to Palestine and Trans-Jordan, where he became Officer Commanding the RAF contingent in that area with promotion to air vice-marshal on July 1, 1939[^33].

When World War II broke out in September 1939, Harris took command of No. 5 Group RAF in England[^34]. He was promoted to air marshal in 1941[^35]. His defining moment came in February 1942, when he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of RAF Bomber Command, a position he would retain for the rest of the war[^36]. At the time of his appointment, Bomber Command was struggling with poor results, inadequate equipment, and questions about its effectiveness[^37]. Harris would transform it into a devastating force capable of reducing entire cities to rubble[^38].

## Major Achievements

Arthur Harris's tenure as Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command was marked by several major military achievements that demonstrated the evolving power of strategic air warfare. His most significant accomplishment was transforming Bomber Command from a struggling force into a powerful strategic weapon that could deliver devastating attacks on enemy territory[^39].

### The Thousand Bomber Raids

Harris's first major innovation came with Operation Millennium, the first RAF "thousand bomber raid" against Cologne (Köln) on the night of May 30-31, 1942[^40]. This operation was groundbreaking in scale and tactics, dropping an average of 31 tons of bombs per square mile and destroying a third of that city[^41]. The raid included the first use of a "bomber stream," a tactical innovation designed to overwhelm the German night-fighters of the Kammhuber Line by concentrating aircraft in time and space[^42]. In Harris's view, raids of at least 300 bombers would improve survivability by saturating radar-controlled anti-aircraft guns and German night fighters equipped with cockpit radar sets[^43]. Serial raids of 700 to 800 bombers were preferred[^44].

The success of the Cologne raid vindicated Harris's belief in mass bombing and provided a much-needed morale boost for Britain, which had suffered years of German bombing[^45]. The operation demonstrated that Bomber Command could strike deep into German territory and inflict significant damage, validating the enormous resources being devoted to the strategic bombing campaign[^46].

### Operation Gomorrah and the Hamburg Firestorm

Between July 24 and August 2, 1943, Harris orchestrated Operation Gomorrah, a campaign against Hamburg that would become one of the most devastating attacks in the history of aerial warfare[^47]. During this unusually dry and hot summer, Harris determined the northern German city a worthy target and ordered a ten-day-long campaign, code-naming it Operation Gomorrah in reference to the biblical rain of fire from heaven[^48]. The raids dropped almost a million tons of bombs on German cities during the war, with half falling on urban areas[^49].

On the night of July 27-28, 739 out of 787 RAF aircraft attacked Hamburg, and the unusually dry and warm weather, the concentration of the bombing in one area, and firefighting limitations culminated in the catastrophic Feuersturm (firestorm)[^50]. The tornado-like fire created a huge inferno with winds of up to 150 mph, reaching temperatures of 815°C and altitudes greater than 1,500 feet, incinerating more than eight square miles of the city[^51]. An estimated 34,000 to 45,000 people were killed, 180,000 more were wounded, and 400,000 were left homeless[^52]. Sixty percent of the city's houses were destroyed[^53].

The Hamburg operation also demonstrated Harris's willingness to adopt new technologies. The initial attack included two innovations: the use of "Window" (later known as chaff)—strips of aluminum foil dropped to confuse German radar—which proved highly effective in reducing bomber losses[^54].

### Technology and Tactical Innovation

Although Harris was initially opposed to the creation of a separate Pathfinder Force, believing it would lead to rivalry and jealousy within non-Pathfinder squadrons, the elite target-marking unit was established in August 1942 over his objections by Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal with Winston Churchill's support[^55]. Harris later acknowledged the value of the Pathfinders, who were normally the first to receive new blind-bombing aids such as Gee, Oboe, and H2S radar[^56].

H2S was the first airborne, ground-scanning radar system, developed for Bomber Command to identify targets on the ground for night and all-weather bombing[^57]. On February 11-12, 1943, against Wilhelmshaven, the Pathfinder Force used their H2S radar for the first time, dropping parachute flares above heavy cloud cover in a technique known as "sky marking"[^58]. This allowed attacks outside the range of various radio navigation aids like Gee or Oboe, which were limited to about 350 kilometers of range from base stations[^59].

### Strategic Impact

Harris concluded that attacks on German cities compelled Germany to draw back versatile anti-aircraft guns and fighters from the front lines, helping the Allies achieve air superiority[^60]. His defenders contend that the bombing played a significant role in the Allied victory in Europe by placing a ceiling on German military output growth, diverting factories to home defense production, and tying up many German troops in antiaircraft duties when they could have been more usefully employed on other fighting fronts[^61].

During Harris's command, RAF Bomber Command flew 501,536 operational sorties[^62]. The campaign represented an enormous investment of Allied resources and manpower, with Harris successfully arguing for the continuation of area bombing despite periodic challenges from political leaders and rival military commanders who favored precision attacks on specific industrial targets[^63].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Arthur Harris remains one of the most controversial figures of World War II, with his strategic bombing campaign generating intense moral and strategic debates that continue to the present day. His explicit advocacy for area bombing and the enormous civilian casualties it produced have led many to denounce him as a war criminal[^64].

### The Policy of Area Bombing

Harris was frustrated by the relative failures of precision bombing raids and advocated massive area bombardments to kill civilians and shatter the enemy's will to fight[^65]. He was completely open and unashamed about this approach, stating that "the aim of Bomber Command should be unambiguously and publicly stated" as "the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany"[^66]. In October 1943, he urged the British government to be honest about the bombing campaign, writing: "The aim of the Combined Bomber Offensive ... should be unambiguously stated [as] the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers, and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany ... They are not by-products of attempts to hit factories"[^67].

Harris even stated: "I want to point out, that besides Essen, we never actually considered any particular industrial sites as targets. The destruction of industrial sites always was some sort of bonus for us"[^68]. This candid admission revealed that civilian casualties were not merely collateral damage but the primary objective of his strategy[^69].

### The Dresden Bombing

The most controversial operation associated with Harris was the bombing of Dresden on the night of February 13-14, 1945[^70]. In this attack, 805 aircraft were dispatched to Dresden and the heart of the city was destroyed in an atrocious firestorm, with an estimated 25,000 people, mostly civilians and refugees, killed[^71]. The timing of the raid—when Germany's defeat was already assured—and the cultural significance of Dresden as a baroque architectural treasure intensified the moral outrage[^72].

The news of Dresden's destruction led to anger in the British Parliament, and Winston Churchill, who had been a strong advocate of area bombing, composed a memorandum questioning "bombing of German cities simply for the sake of increasing the terror"[^73]. In response, Harris wrote that he "could never subscribe" to stopping city attacks, stating: "I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier"[^74]. This statement exemplified Harris's unwavering commitment to his strategy and his apparent indifference to German civilian suffering[^75].

### War Crimes Allegations

Harris has been identified as the key architect of Bomber Command's area bombing policy that resulted in the devastation of German cities and the deaths of thousands of German civilians, leading to him being vilified as a mass murderer and a war criminal[^76]. It has been estimated that 600,000 German civilians were killed in the bombing raids planned by Harris[^77]. Red paint has been splashed across the Arthur Harris monument in the past, and TripAdvisor reviews about the Green Park memorial feature acrimonious commentaries referring to the air marshal and Bomber Command as war criminals[^78].

After the war, when the true nature of this bombing became known, Harris was publicly vilified, and in disgrace he left the country to reside in South Africa from 1946 to 1953[^79]. He never expressed remorse and was never officially called to account for his actions[^80].

Philosopher A.C. Grayling concluded that "the area-bombing campaigns of the second World War were as a whole morally criminal," stating: "it cannot be said that deliberately targeting civilians and dropping thousands of tons of bombs on them remorselessly over many years is a side-effect of war"[^81].

### The Cost to Allied Aircrews

Harris's strategy also came at an enormous cost to his own men, earning him the nickname "Butcher" or "Butch" among some aircrew members[^82]. The losses suffered by RAF Bomber Command were staggering: 55,573 aircrew were killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew, representing a 44.4% death rate[^83]. A further 8,403 men were wounded in action, and 9,838 became prisoners of war[^84]. A crew member on a British bomber had a shorter life expectancy than an infantryman in the trenches of World War I[^85]. The overall loss rate for Bomber Command operations was 2.2 percent, but loss rates over Germany were significantly higher; from November 1943 to March 1944, losses averaged 5.1 percent[^86]. The highest loss rate (11.8 percent) was incurred on the Nuremberg raid on March 30, 1944[^87].

Despite these horrific casualties, Harris remained committed to his strategy, believing the sacrifice was necessary to defeat Nazi Germany[^88].

## Personal Life

Arthur Harris was married twice in his life. His first marriage was to Barbara Daisy Kyrle Money Boultbee on August 30, 1916, in Kensington[^89]. This marriage lasted until 1935, during which time the couple had at least one child[^90]. His decision to remain in the RAF rather than return to Rhodesia after World War I was partly motivated by his belief that Barbara would not enjoy being a Rhodesian farmer's wife[^91].

In 1938, Harris married his second wife, Thérèse Hearne, in Marylebone, London[^92]. This marriage lasted until his death in 1984[^93]. Harris had four children in total: Anthony Travers Kyrle Harris (his son and heir to the Baronetcy), Marigold Patricia Armitage, Rosemary Jeanne Harris, and one daughter whose details remain private[^94]. Sadly, the Baronetcy of Harris of Chipping Wycombe, which had begun with him as 1st Baronet, became extinct in 1996 when his only son, Anthony, died without an heir[^95].

Those who knew Harris described him as a complex personality—a fearsome and inspiring leader who sparked great loyalty among those who took to the skies at his command[^96]. Historian Max Hastings stated: "He was passionately concerned to give every man in his Command the best possible chance of survival"[^97]. However, his nickname "Butcher" or "Butch" within the RAF also suggested a reputation for ruthlessness and a willingness to accept heavy casualties in pursuit of his strategic objectives[^98].

Harris was known for his blunt speaking and unwillingness to compromise on matters he considered essential to the war effort[^99]. His personality was characterized by absolute conviction in the rightness of his strategic approach and an iron determination to see it through regardless of criticism[^100]. Henry Probert's biography, drawing on Harris's private papers and family scrapbooks, portrayed him in his postwar years as a family man and country gentleman, providing a more complete picture of his character beyond his wartime role[^101].

After World War II, Harris managed the South African Marine Corporation from 1946 to 1953 while living in South Africa[^102]. He lived there disappointed by the reappraisal of his war aims and methods, as the morality and efficacy of saturation bombing came under severe question[^103]. In February 1953, Winston Churchill, who was prime minister again, insisted that Harris accept a baronetcy, making him the 1st Baronet of Chipping Wycombe—a hereditary title but not a peerage[^104]. In the same year, he returned to the UK and lived his remaining years in Ferry House in Goring-on-Thames, located directly adjacent to the River Thames[^105].

Harris remained adamant that RAF Bomber Command's area bombing campaign was justified through the day he died[^106]. He never softened from his view that saturation bombings were completely necessary, maintaining "The Germans started the war" as his firm conviction until he died in 1984[^107]. He passed away on April 5, 1984, at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, England, just eight days before his 92nd birthday[^108]. Arthur was cremated, with his remains being interred at the Goring Cemetery, Goring, South Oxfordshire[^109].

## Legacy

Arthur Harris's legacy remains deeply contested, with his reputation varying dramatically depending on perspective and the passage of time. For many who served under him and for those who viewed the defeat of Nazi Germany as justifying almost any means, Harris remains a hero of the struggle against Hitler's Reich[^110]. For others, particularly in Germany and among critics of strategic bombing, he represents the moral compromises and atrocities committed even by the Allied powers during World War II[^111].

### The Statue Controversy

The most visible symbol of the ongoing debate over Harris's legacy is the statue erected in his honor outside St Clement Danes Church in London[^112]. The statue, created by sculptor Faith Winter, was unveiled on May 31, 1992, by Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother, as a memorial to Harris and over 55,000 men of Bomber Command who lost their lives in the war[^113]. The unveiling occurred on the 50th anniversary of the first Allied 1,000 bomber raid[^114].

The statue generated significant controversy both before and during the unveiling. Protesters against the statue included the Mayor of Cologne, and several German cities held memorial services for the estimated 500,000 civilians who died in the bombing raids, with civic leaders condemning the Harris statue[^115]. The Queen Mother appeared surprised when she was jeered at by protesters, one of whom shouted, "Harris was a war criminal"[^116]. Her speech was disrupted with shouts of "mass murderer," and following repeated vandalism, the statue was subjected to a 24-hour guard for some months[^117]. There were protests at the unveiling, and the statue and plinth were sprayed with red paint and the word "Shame" in October of that year[^118].

Despite the controversy, a poll in The Sunday Telegraph suggested a majority of people, by a margin of more than two to one, supported the raising of the monument[^119]. This division of opinion reflects the broader ambivalence in British society about Harris and the bombing campaign he directed[^120].

### The Scapegoat Debate

One crucial aspect of Harris's legacy involves the question of responsibility for the area bombing policy. The strategic bombing of German cities was not initiated by Harris: it was a British War Cabinet decision, taken before Harris took over at Bomber Command, and in the aftermath of the Luftwaffe's devastating bombing of Britain[^121]. Harris pursued his policy of civilian bombing with the knowledge and encouragement of the wartime Chiefs of Staff and of Prime Minister Winston Churchill[^122].

However, Prime Minister Churchill, who had once been a staunch supporter of the bombing campaign, distanced himself from Harris and his men after the war[^123]. In his victory speech, he praised "the fighters" but conspicuously omitted any mention of Bomber Command[^124]. This perceived betrayal has led some historians and veterans to argue that Harris was made a scapegoat for a policy that had been approved at the highest levels of British government[^125].

Unlike other senior commanders, Harris did not receive a peerage after the war, a slight that was widely noted[^126]. Many who served under him gave him their support in the controversy surrounding the decisions he made, highlighting how indispensable those operations were and what an upright man Harris was[^127].

### Impact on Military Doctrine

Harris's bombing campaign has had a lasting impact on military doctrine and the laws of war. The debates over the morality and effectiveness of strategic bombing that began during Harris's lifetime continue to influence contemporary discussions about air power, civilian casualties, and the ethics of warfare[^128]. Modern international humanitarian law's restrictions on targeting civilians owe much to the lessons learned from the World War II bombing campaigns[^129].

The question of whether the bombing campaign shortened the war or was worth the cost in civilian lives and Allied aircrew casualties remains unresolved among historians[^130]. While the bombing did not prevent a sustained increase in German military production or fatally undermine civilian morale, its effects were considerable in diverting German resources and limiting the ceiling on military output growth[^131].

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Arthur Harris argue that his strategic bombing campaign played a crucial role in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany and that his actions must be judged within the context of total war against a genocidal regime. For some, Harris was and remains a hero of the titanic struggle against Hitler's Reich and the evil it spawned across Europe[^132].

Military historians who support Harris's legacy contend that the bombing played a significant role in the Allied victory in Europe[^133]. Although the bombing did not prevent a sustained increase in German military production or fatally undermine civilian morale, the effects were considerable—including placing a ceiling on military output growth, diverting factories to home defense production, and tying up many German troops in antiaircraft duties when they could have been more usefully employed on other fighting fronts[^134]. These defenders argue that every German fighter plane defending the homeland was one that could not be used on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union or in other theaters[^135].

Historian Max Hastings, despite his critical assessment of the bombing campaign's effectiveness, acknowledged Harris's concern for his men, stating: "He was passionately concerned to give every man in his Command the best possible chance of survival"[^136]. This suggests that Harris's tactical innovations, such as the bomber stream, were designed not only to increase effectiveness but also to reduce casualties among his aircrews[^137].

Historian Robin Neillands set out to help rehabilitate Air Chief Marshal Harris, arguing that the commander of the Royal Air Force Bomber Command deserved recognition for his role in defeating Nazi Germany[^138]. Henry Probert's 2001 biography, which drew on Harris's private papers and represented a critical but sympathetic account, has become the new standard work on Harris, providing a more nuanced understanding of his motivations and character[^139].

Supporters emphasize that the area bombing policy was not Harris's invention but a British War Cabinet decision made before he took command, and that he implemented it with the full knowledge and encouragement of Churchill and the Chiefs of Staff[^140]. From this perspective, singling out Harris for criticism while absolving the political leadership who ordered the bombing campaign is both unfair and historically inaccurate[^141].

Many veterans of Bomber Command remain fiercely loyal to Harris's memory, believing that they fought a necessary campaign against Nazi tyranny and that their sacrifices—with a 44.4% death rate—deserve recognition rather than condemnation[^142]. For these veterans, Harris was a leader who gave them the best chance of survival in an extraordinarily dangerous mission[^143].

### Negative Views

Critics of Arthur Harris argue that his area bombing campaign constituted a war crime, that it was strategically ineffective, and that it represented a moral failure by Allied leadership. Harris has been identified as the key architect of Bomber Command's area bombing policy that resulted in the devastation of German cities and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of German civilians, leading many to vilify him as a mass murderer and war criminal[^144].

Philosopher A.C. Grayling concluded that "the area-bombing campaigns of the second World War were as a whole morally criminal," stating: "it cannot be said that deliberately targeting civilians and dropping thousands of tons of bombs on them remorselessly over many years is a side-effect of war"[^145]. This moral critique argues that Harris's strategy violated fundamental principles of just war theory, which distinguish between combatants and non-combatants[^146].

Critics point to Harris's own statements as evidence of his culpability. His assertion that "the aim of Bomber Command should be unambiguously and publicly stated" as "the destruction of German cities, the killing of German workers and the disruption of civilised life throughout Germany" reveals that civilian casualties were not regrettable collateral damage but the deliberate objective of the campaign[^147]. His statement that "I do not personally regard the whole of the remaining cities of Germany as worth the bones of one British Grenadier" has been interpreted as showing callous indifference to human suffering[^148].

The bombing of Dresden in February 1945, when Germany's defeat was already assured, exemplifies for critics the moral bankruptcy of Harris's approach[^149]. The destruction of this culturally significant city and the deaths of approximately 25,000 people, mostly civilians and refugees, seemed to serve no clear military purpose[^150].

Some historians argue that the strategic bombing campaign was ineffective, failing to significantly reduce German war production or break civilian morale[^151]. According to this view, Harris's obstinate commitment to area bombing wasted resources that could have been better employed in supporting the D-Day invasion or in precision attacks on specific targets such as German oil production facilities[^152].

Critics also note the enormous cost to Allied aircrews—55,573 killed out of 125,000—arguing that Harris's stubborn adherence to his strategic vision amounted to a callous waste of his own men's lives[^153]. His nickname "Butcher" among some RAF personnel reflected this perception[^154].

The fact that Harris never expressed remorse for the civilian casualties caused by his bombing campaign and maintained until his death in 1984 that the strategy was justified has led critics to view him as unrepentant[^155]. His years in South Africa from 1946 to 1953 are sometimes characterized as a self-imposed exile to avoid facing the consequences of his actions[^156].

Modern critics argue that Harris's bombing campaign set dangerous precedents for the indiscriminate use of air power against civilian populations, contributing to the horrors of aerial bombardment in subsequent conflicts[^157]. The debate over his legacy continues to resonate in contemporary discussions about the ethics of warfare, civilian casualties, and the moral limits of military necessity[^158].
