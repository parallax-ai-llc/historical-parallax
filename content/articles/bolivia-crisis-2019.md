## Summary

Was it a coup or a popular uprising? The question still divides Bolivia—and the world. On November 10, 2019, Evo Morales, the country's first Indigenous president and its longest-serving leader, resigned and fled to Mexico. He called it a coup d'état. His opponents called it the restoration of democracy after Morales tried to steal an election. The truth may be somewhere between—or include elements of both.[^1]

Bolivia's crisis began with Morales running for a fourth term despite losing a 2016 referendum on term limits. When the vote count on October 20, 2019, suddenly stopped—then restarted showing Morales winning outright—the opposition cried fraud. Protests erupted. The Organization of American States declared the election rigged. The military "suggested" Morales resign. Within weeks, an opposition senator was declaring herself president in an empty chamber, holding a Bible aloft.[^2]

The aftermath was bloody. At least 35 people died in clashes between pro-Morales and anti-Morales forces, including massacres in Senkata and Sacaba. The interim government of Jeanine Áñez arrested opposition figures, postponed elections, and faced its own scandals. In October 2020, Morales's party won a landslide—and Áñez was later imprisoned for coup charges. Bolivia's 2019 crisis remains a contested wound in Latin American memory.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Evo Morales and the MAS

**Evo Morales:**

- First Indigenous president (2006)
- Movement for Socialism (MAS) party
- Nationalized gas; reduced poverty
- Popular especially among Indigenous majority

**His record:**

- GDP growth and poverty reduction
- But: Authoritarian tendencies
- 2016 referendum: Voters rejected removing term limits
- **Constitutional Court** overturned referendum result (2017)
- Morales ran for fourth term anyway[^4]

### The 2019 Election

**October 20, 2019:**

- Election held
- Early results: Morales leading but runoff likely
- Suddenly: Transmission of preliminary results stopped for 24 hours
- When resumed: Morales ahead enough to win outright

**Immediate response:**

- Opposition cried fraud
- Protests in cities
- Violence began[^5]

---

## The Crisis

### The OAS Audit

**The Organization of American States:**

- Invited by Morales to audit
- November 10, 2019: Preliminary report
- Found "clear manipulation"
- Two hidden servers
- Falsified tally sheets

**The OAS report was decisive—but later contested.**

**Morales:**

- Initially agreed to new elections
- Then events moved faster[^6]

### The Resignations (November 10)

**The sequence:**

- Police mutinied (switching sides)
- Military commander "suggested" Morales resign "for peace"
- Morales resigned on national television
- Vice President García Linera resigned
- Senate president resigned
- Other officials resigned

**By end of day:**

- Morales fleeing to Mexico
- Power vacuum

**He called it a coup. Military involvement and his forced departure support this. But there were genuine protests. It was both and neither—a "civilian-military moment" is how some analysts describe it.**[^7]

### Jeanine Áñez Takes Power

**November 12, 2019:**

- Jeanine Áñez, second Senate vice president
- Declared herself interim president
- Chamber lacked quorum (MAS legislators boycotted)
- Entered with Bible: "The Bible returns to the palace"

**Her government:**

- Recognized by US, some Latin American countries
- Promised elections within 90 days
- But: Delayed elections (COVID excuse later)
- Arrested opposition figures
- Faced accusations of authoritarianism[^8]

## Death Toll

**Total killed (October-November 2019):**

| Period                      | Deaths  |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| Election protests (October) | ~3      |
| Post-resignation clashes    | ~32     |
| **Total**                   | **~35** |

**Major massacres:**

| Date              | Location          | Deaths |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| November 15, 2019 | Sacaba            | 9      |
| November 19, 2019 | Senkata (El Alto) | 10     |

**Sacaba and Senkata:**

- Pro-Morales protesters shot by security forces
- Under Áñez government
- Later deemed massacres by human rights groups

**Both sides had victims.** But the post-coup violence was primarily state against pro-Morales protesters.[^9]

## Aftermath

### The Áñez Government (2019-2020)

**Actions:**

- Delayed elections (said COVID)
- Arrested opposition
- Recognized Guaidó in Venezuela
- Controversies and corruption allegations

**Criticism:**

- IACHR condemned Sacaba and Senkata
- Human rights groups documented abuses
- Democratic legitimacy questioned

### 2020 Elections

**October 18, 2020:**

- Elections finally held
- **Luis Arce (MAS) won** with 55%
- Morales's party returned to power
- Morales returned from exile

**This undermined coup narrative—but also fraud narrative.**

- If it was a coup to stop MAS, it failed spectacularly
- If there was fraud in 2019, MAS clearly had genuine support[^10]

### Áñez Imprisoned

**2021:**

- Áñez arrested for "coup" and terrorism
- Sentenced to 10 years
- Remains controversial political prisoner or convicted coup plotter, depending on view

**Morales:**

- Returned but faces some charges
- Remains influential but not president
- Arce now governs[^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Was It a Coup?

**Arguments FOR (coup):**

- Military "suggested" resignation (no president needs such suggestion)
- Morales was elected, however flawed
- Successor had no constitutional mandate
- Violence against pro-Morales protesters

**Arguments AGAINST (not a coup):**

- Genuine popular protests preceded resignation
- OAS documented fraud
- Morales violated 2016 referendum
- He resigned (wasn't arrested immediately)

**Academic consensus:** Elements of both—a "hybrid" event. Popular mobilization + elite/military intervention + contested election.[^12]

### The OAS Controversy

**Later studies (CEPR, others):**

- Challenged OAS statistical claims
- Argued no clear evidence of fraud
- Noted OAS methodology problems

**But:**

- OAS stood by findings
- Debate continues

**We may never know if fraud occurred—but the OAS report's impact was immediate and decisive.**

### Comparison

| Crisis           | Nature                       | Outcome                                  |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Honduras 2009    | Military coup                | President ousted                         |
| **Bolivia 2019** | **Hybrid**                   | **President ousted; returned via party** |
| Peru 2019        | President dissolved Congress | President removed but no coup debate     |

## Legacy

### For Bolivia

- Deep polarization remains
- MAS back in power but Morales sidelined
- Áñez in prison
- 2019 remembered very differently by different sides

### For Latin America

- Debate over what constitutes a coup
- OAS credibility questioned by some
- Role of military still decisive

### The Dead

- Sacaba and Senkata victims commemorated
- Martyrs for both sides claimed
- Wounds not healed[^13]
