## Summary

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad served as the sixth president of the Islamic Republic of Iran from 2005 to 2013, becoming the first non-cleric to hold the office in 24 years.[^1] Born to a working-class family in 1956, he rose from humble origins as the son of a blacksmith and grocer to become one of the most controversial world leaders of the early 21st century.[^2] His presidency was marked by aggressive foreign policy stances, particularly regarding Iran's nuclear program and Israel, coupled with populist domestic economic policies that ultimately contributed to significant inflation and unemployment.[^3] His denial of the Holocaust, inflammatory rhetoric about Israel, and the disputed 2009 presidential election that sparked the Green Movement protests defined his international image and left a deeply contested legacy.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was born on October 28, 1956, in the village of Aradan, near Garmsar, in Semnan province, Iran.[^5] He was the fourth son among seven children in a devout Shia Muslim family.[^6] His father, Ahmad, worked as a blacksmith, grocer, and barber, while his mother, Khanom, was a Sayyida—an honorific title given to those believed to be direct bloodline descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.[^7] This religious lineage would later inform Ahmadinejad's deep commitment to Islamic revolutionary principles and his belief in the imminent return of the Hidden Imam, the Twelfth Imam of Shia Islam.[^8]

When Mahmoud was approximately one year old, his family relocated from their rural village to Tehran, seeking better economic opportunities in Iran's capital city.[^9] This migration from countryside to urban center was typical of many Iranian families during the 1950s and 1960s, as industrialization and modernization drew rural populations to cities.[^10] Upon settling in Tehran, his father made a significant decision that would shape the family's future: he changed their surname from "Saborjhian" (or "Sabbaghian" in some accounts) to "Ahmadinejad" in 1960.[^11] The original name, Sabor, meant "thread-painter" in Persian, referring to a once-common occupation within the Semnan carpet industry.[^12] The name change was motivated by a desire to avoid potential discrimination and prejudice that rural families often faced when integrating into Tehran's more cosmopolitan society.[^13]

Despite the family's modest economic circumstances, Ahmad Ahmadinejad placed great emphasis on religious education and taught the Quran to his children.[^14] This strong religious foundation, combined with the family's working-class status, instilled in young Mahmoud both a deep commitment to Islamic principles and an identification with Iran's poor and marginalized classes—themes that would later become central to his political identity and populist appeal.[^15] Growing up in Tehran during the 1960s and early 1970s, Ahmadinejad witnessed the rapid modernization and Westernization of Iranian society under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, developments that many religious conservatives viewed with suspicion and resentment.[^16]

In 1976, Ahmadinejad took Iran's highly competitive national university entrance examination, a standardized test that determined admission to the country's universities.[^17] According to his autobiography, he achieved an impressive rank of 132nd out of approximately 400,000 participants that year, demonstrating exceptional academic ability.[^18] This high score earned him admission to the prestigious Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Tehran, where he enrolled to study civil engineering.[^19] His admission to this selective technical university represented a significant achievement for someone from his modest background and provided him with educational opportunities that would prove crucial to his later career.[^20]

## Rise to Power

During his university years, Ahmadinejad became increasingly politically active as Iran entered its revolutionary period. In 1978-79, during the Iranian Revolution that would topple the Shah and establish the Islamic Republic, he emerged as one of the student leaders who organized demonstrations against the Pahlavi monarchy.[^21] This involvement in the revolutionary movement placed him among the generation of young Islamist activists who would come to dominate Iran's post-revolutionary political landscape.[^22] His participation in the Revolution connected him to networks of like-minded religious conservatives who shared his vision of an Islamic state and who would later become crucial allies in his political career.[^23]

Following the establishment of the Islamic Republic in 1979, Ahmadinejad continued his education while simultaneously serving Iran's new revolutionary institutions. In 1981, he married Azam Farahi, who pursued a career in university-level teaching.[^24] That same year or shortly thereafter, he joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the military organization created to protect the Revolution and its achievements.[^25] During the devastating Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), Ahmadinejad served with the Revolutionary Guards, though accounts differ regarding the exact nature and extent of his military service.[^26] He continued his studies at IUST throughout this period, demonstrating remarkable dedication by balancing military service with academic pursuits.[^27]

Ahmadinejad eventually completed his doctorate in transportation engineering and planning, though sources differ on whether he finished in 1987 or 1997, with his own website biography giving the later date.[^28] After the war, he transitioned into academic and administrative roles, teaching at IUST while also taking on government positions.[^29] In 1993, he was appointed Governor of Ardabil Province in northwestern Iran, a position he held until 1997.[^30] This governorship provided him with valuable administrative experience and helped him build connections within Iran's complex political system, which operated through intricate networks of clerical, military, and governmental institutions.[^31]

His major breakthrough came in 2003 when he was appointed mayor of Tehran by the city's conservative-dominated council.[^32] As mayor, Ahmadinejad cultivated a reputation as a populist administrator who prioritized the needs of the poor and working classes.[^33] He implemented policies aimed at improving traffic management and keeping prices down, earning praise from some quarters for his hands-on administrative style.[^34] However, his tenure was also marked by controversial decisions, including reversing some cultural reforms implemented by previous reformist administrations and promoting more conservative social policies.[^35] He frequently appeared at construction sites and public events, projecting an image of a humble public servant who remained connected to ordinary Iranians—a sharp contrast to the more elite and Western-educated politicians who had dominated Iranian politics in the 1990s and early 2000s.[^36]

In 2005, Ahmadinejad entered the presidential race as a relative outsider, campaigning on a populist platform that emphasized social justice, anti-corruption, and a return to the values of the 1979 Revolution.[^37] His campaign resonated with lower-income Iranians who felt left behind by the economic reforms of the 1990s and disillusioned with the reformist movement that had promised political liberalization but delivered limited results.[^38] In the first round of voting, he unexpectedly advanced to a runoff against former president and establishment figure Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani.[^39] In the second round held on June 24, 2005, Ahmadinejad won a decisive victory with approximately 62% of the vote, defeating Rafsanjani by a wide margin.[^40] He was sworn in as president on August 3, 2005, marking the beginning of what would become one of the most controversial presidencies in modern Iranian history.[^41]

## Major Achievements

Upon assuming office in August 2005, Ahmadinejad became the first non-clerical president to lead Iran in 24 years, representing what many saw as a victory for the revolutionary working class over the clerical and technocratic elites who had dominated Iranian politics since 1979.[^42] His supporters viewed his election as a rejection of the corruption and elitism that had characterized previous administrations and a return to the egalitarian promises of the Islamic Revolution.[^43]

On the international stage, one of Ahmadinejad's most significant initiatives was asserting Iran's right to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. He vigorously defended Iran's nuclear program, framing it as a matter of national sovereignty and scientific achievement rather than a military threat.[^44] He famously declared that "nuclear energy is the scientific achievement of the Iranian nation," presenting the program as a source of national pride.[^45] While this stance brought Iran into conflict with Western powers and resulted in increasingly severe international sanctions, many Iranians across the political spectrum supported Iran's right to nuclear technology, seeing Ahmadinejad's defiant stance as a defense of national interests against foreign pressure.[^46]

In March 2008, Ahmadinejad became the first Iranian president to visit Iraq since the Islamic Revolution, a historic diplomatic achievement that symbolized improving relations between the two countries following decades of enmity stemming from the Iran-Iraq War.[^47] This visit represented Iran's growing influence in Iraq following the 2003 U.S. invasion and the establishment of a Shia-led government in Baghdad.[^48] The trip demonstrated Ahmadinejad's ability to capitalize on regional developments to enhance Iran's position as a major power in the Middle East.[^49]

Domestically, Ahmadinejad pursued populist economic policies aimed at redistributing oil revenues to Iran's poor and rural populations. He implemented subsidy programs and cash handout schemes designed to provide direct financial assistance to lower-income Iranians.[^50] These programs initially proved popular with his core constituency and helped solidify his support among the urban poor and rural voters.[^51] He also promoted infrastructure development projects in underserved provinces, positioning himself as a president who cared about all Iranians, not just the wealthy urban classes of Tehran and other major cities.[^52]

In the cultural sphere, Ahmadinejad promoted what he termed a return to revolutionary values, emphasizing Islamic identity and resistance to Western cultural influence. He increased funding for religious institutions and promoted traditional Islamic values in education and media.[^53] His administration also emphasized Iran's Persian and Islamic heritage, promoting cultural programs that celebrated Iran's historical contributions to science, literature, and philosophy.[^54]

Ahmadinejad won re-election on June 13, 2009, officially receiving 62.63% of the vote (24,527,516 votes) compared to his main challenger Mir-Hossein Mousavi's 33.75% (13,216,411 votes).[^55] From his supporters' perspective, this represented a popular mandate for continuing his policies and a rejection of the reformist opposition.[^56] He was sworn in for his second term on August 5, 2009, making him one of the few Iranian presidents to serve two complete terms.[^57]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Ahmadinejad's presidency generated intense controversy both domestically and internationally, with critics arguing that his policies and rhetoric damaged Iran's interests and international standing. His economic management drew severe criticism from Iranian economists and business leaders. In June 2006 and June 2007, prominent Iranian economists published two open letters lambasting the president for what they termed "populist" policies that they argued were economically irresponsible.[^58] They criticized him for excessive spending of oil revenues during a period of high oil prices, warning that such policies would prove unsustainable.[^59] These predictions proved accurate: inflation and unemployment rates both increased significantly during his tenure, undermining his populist economic agenda and causing particular hardship for the middle class.[^60]

His 2007 Gas Rationing Plan, designed to reduce Iran's fuel consumption, sparked protests and public anger as Iranians faced restrictions on gasoline purchases despite living in one of the world's major oil-producing nations.[^61] In October 2008, after traditional merchants in Tehran's Grand Bazaar and other cities went on strike, Ahmadinejad was forced to suspend implementation of a new value added tax (VAT), demonstrating the limits of his political power when faced with organized economic opposition.[^62] His policy of cutting maximum interest rates for banks created distortions in the financial system and contributed to inflation.[^63]

On the international stage, Ahmadinejad became one of the most controversial world leaders through his inflammatory rhetoric and provocative statements. His repeated questioning of the Holocaust drew worldwide condemnation from historians, political leaders, and human rights organizations.[^64] He called the Holocaust a "myth" on multiple occasions and in 2006 hosted a conference in Tehran that brought together Holocaust deniers and revisionists from around the world.[^65] In 2009, when he stated at the United Nations General Assembly that "They [the Western powers] launched the myth of the Holocaust. They lied, they put on a show and then they support the Jews," representatives of several nations walked out in protest.[^66] These statements not only offended Jewish communities worldwide but also embarrassed many Iranians who did not share his views.[^67]

His rhetoric regarding Israel was equally inflammatory. He made statements that were interpreted as calling for Israel's destruction, including the widely quoted phrase about wiping Israel "off the map," though scholars have debated the exact translation of his Persian remarks.[^68] He called Israel "a rotten, dried tree that will be eliminated by one storm" and described the Zionist regime as "an injustice" that was "heading toward annihilation."[^69] These statements heightened international tensions and contributed to Iran's diplomatic isolation.[^70]

Ahmadinejad made numerous other controversial statements that damaged Iran's international reputation. In 2007, during a speech at Columbia University in New York, he claimed that "we do not have homosexuals in Iran like you do [in America]," a statement that was widely ridiculed and contradicted documented evidence of LGBTQ+ persecution in Iran.[^71] He also made provocative statements about the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, calling them "the mysterious September 11 incident" and suggesting alternative explanations for the attacks that echoed conspiracy theories.[^72]

The 2009 presidential election and its aftermath represented perhaps the greatest controversy of Ahmadinejad's presidency. The election results were strongly disputed by both opposition candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi and their supporters, who alleged widespread electoral fraud.[^73] Street protests began the day after the election was announced and continued periodically into 2010, spawning what became known as the Green Movement.[^74] Up to 3 million peaceful demonstrators took to Tehran's streets with the simple slogan "Where is my vote?", in what observers claimed were the largest protests since the Iranian Revolution of 1978.[^75] The government's violent crackdown on protesters resulted in at least 100 deaths, hundreds of arrests, and the imprisonment and torture of opposition activists.[^76] In 2011, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and Mehdi Karroubi were placed under house arrest, where they remained for years.[^77] The brutal suppression of the Green Movement severely damaged Iran's international image and created lasting divisions within Iranian society.[^78]

Ahmadinejad's relationship with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei deteriorated significantly during his second term, culminating in an unprecedented power struggle between the president and Iran's highest authority.[^79] On March 14, 2012, Ahmadinejad became the first president since the Iranian Revolution to be summoned before parliament to answer questions—a humiliating moment that demonstrated his declining political power.[^80] His attempts to assert presidential authority against the wishes of the Supreme Leader and the clerical establishment alienated many of his original conservative supporters.[^81]

## Personal Life

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad married Azam Farahi in 1981, during the early years of the Islamic Republic.[^82] Azam Farahi pursued a career in university-level teaching, maintaining a professional life despite her husband's prominent political position.[^83] Unlike the wives of some other world leaders, she maintained a relatively low public profile, rarely appearing at official events or giving interviews.[^84] The couple has three children: one daughter, Fatemeh, and two sons, Mehdi and Alireza.[^85]

Family connections played a significant role in Ahmadinejad's political circle. His older son, Mehdi, married the daughter of Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei in 2007, cementing Ahmadinejad's relationship with Mashaei, who became his controversial chief of staff and closest advisor.[^86] This relationship would later cause significant political problems, as many conservatives viewed Mashaei with suspicion for his allegedly nationalist rather than Islamist orientation.[^87] His younger son, Alireza, married the niece of former military general Mahmoud Kaveh, further demonstrating how family ties intertwined with political and military networks in Iranian elite circles.[^88]

Despite achieving the highest political office in Iran, Ahmadinejad cultivated an image of personal modesty and simple living. His supporters considered him a simple man who led a modest life, contrasting sharply with the perceived elitism of other Iranian politicians.[^89] As president, he reportedly wanted to continue living in the same house in Tehran where his family had resided before his election, only moving when security advisers insisted it was necessary for his protection.[^90] This commitment to modest living, whether genuine or calculated for political effect, resonated with many ordinary Iranians who appreciated what they saw as his unpretentious character.[^91]

Ahmadinejad was known for his simple dress and unpretentious manners. He typically wore plain suits or the simple jacket associated with Iranian revolutionaries rather than the formal clerical robes of many Iranian politicians or the expensive Western-style suits favored by technocratic elites.[^92] He frequently appeared at construction sites, spoke with workers and common people, and maintained a public persona as a man of the people despite wielding considerable power.[^93] This personal style was central to his political identity and helped maintain his appeal to working-class and rural Iranians throughout his political career.[^94]

His deep religious convictions, particularly his belief in the imminent return of the Hidden Imam (the Mahdi in Shia Islamic eschatology), influenced his worldview and political decisions.[^95] Critics sometimes portrayed him as a religious extremist whose millenarian beliefs shaped his confrontational foreign policy and apocalyptic rhetoric.[^96] However, supporters viewed his religious devotion as genuine piety rather than extremism, seeing him as a faithful Muslim who brought religious values into governance.[^97]

## Legacy

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's legacy remains deeply contested, with assessments varying dramatically based on political perspective, ideological orientation, and the criteria used for evaluation. His eight years as president (2005-2013) left an indelible mark on Iranian politics, society, and international relations, but whether that mark represents progress or regression depends largely on who is making the assessment.[^98]

For Iranians and international observers who oppose his political and religious vision, Ahmadinejad's legacy is decisively negative. Critics view his presidency as "a dark moment in the country's history when the gradual development of a liberal society in Iran as cultivated by Ahmadinejad's predecessors Rafsanjani and Khatami was brought to a halt."[^99] They argue that he reversed the limited political and cultural openings achieved during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) and hardened Iran's international isolation through his confrontational rhetoric and policies.[^100] The brutal suppression of the Green Movement in 2009 particularly stains his legacy in the eyes of democracy advocates and human rights activists.[^101]

Conversely, Iranians who agree with his political and religious ideas and those who feel inspired by his call to resist Western hegemony are likely to remember him as a national hero who served the country's national and security interests.[^102] From this perspective, Ahmadinejad stood firm against international pressure regarding Iran's nuclear program, defended Iranian sovereignty, and represented the interests of the poor and marginalized against corrupt elites.[^103] His supporters view his defiance of Western powers as principled resistance rather than reckless belligerence.[^104]

Professor Nader Habibi's comprehensive scholarly assessment concludes that Ahmadinejad's economic legacy is "tainted by mismanagement and contradiction, due in part to his misunderstanding of key fundamental economic concepts."[^105] The economic data supports this harsh verdict: despite benefiting from historically high oil prices during much of his tenure, Iran's economy suffered from high inflation, unemployment, and misallocation of resources.[^106] His government also facilitated the growing penetration of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the Basij militia into Iran's economy and banking system, with increasing international sanctions serving as both a rationale and an excuse for this economic empowerment of military and paramilitary organizations.[^107] This militarization of the economy created entrenched interests that would prove difficult for subsequent administrations to dislodge.[^108]

Some historians suggest that Ahmadinejad "is more likely to be remembered by historians as the man who hastened" the Islamic Republic's decay rather than as a leader who strengthened it.[^109] This assessment argues that his confrontational style, economic mismanagement, and the political crisis following the 2009 election exposed fundamental weaknesses in Iran's political system and accelerated processes of decline that might otherwise have progressed more slowly.[^110] His legacy may ultimately be that of "a leader with an unusually contentious personality who did little to solve Iran's problems during eight years in office and, sometimes, directly helped exacerbate them."[^111]

In the realm of international relations, Ahmadinejad's presidency coincided with a significant deterioration in Iran's global position. The increasingly severe sanctions imposed on Iran during his tenure, while ostensibly focused on the nuclear program, were facilitated by the diplomatic isolation his rhetoric created.[^112] His inflammatory statements about Israel and the Holocaust made it politically easier for Western governments to build international coalitions against Iran and harder for potential allies to defend Iranian positions.[^113] The sanctions imposed during his presidency devastated Iran's economy, restricted its access to international financial systems, and created hardships that persisted well beyond his time in office.[^114]

However, Ahmadinejad's confrontational approach to Iran's nuclear program also had an unintended long-term consequence: it helped establish Iran's nuclear capabilities as a fait accompli that subsequent negotiations had to accept.[^115] By the time he left office, Iran had significantly expanded its nuclear infrastructure despite international sanctions and pressure, creating facts on the ground that shaped the parameters of the 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by his successor.[^116] Whether this represents a strategic success or a costly miscalculation remains debated.[^117]

After leaving office in August 2013, Ahmadinejad initially maintained a relatively low profile but subsequently attempted political comebacks that illustrated both his continued ambition and his diminished political capital. He announced his intention to run for a third term in April 2017, but his nomination was rejected by the Guardian Council, reportedly with the encouragement of Supreme Leader Khamenei.[^118] He made another attempt to register for the 2021 presidential election, which was again rejected by the Guardian Council.[^119] In 2024, he registered as a candidate in the presidential election following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi but was once again rejected.[^120] These repeated rejections demonstrated the extent to which Iran's political establishment, including former allies, had turned against him.[^121]

His legacy remains contentious, characterized by both his populist appeal to Iran's working classes and his polarizing effect on international relations.[^122] The passage of time may allow for more balanced historical assessments, but during and immediately after his presidency, Ahmadinejad remained one of the most divisive figures in contemporary Iranian and Middle Eastern politics.[^123] His tenure illustrates the complexities of Iran's political system, the tensions between populist politics and economic management, and the challenges of navigating international relations while maintaining revolutionary credentials.[^124]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Ahmadinejad's presidency point to several accomplishments and principled stances that they believe history will vindicate. From this perspective, Ahmadinejad represented a genuine voice for Iran's marginalized and working-class populations who had been neglected by previous technocratic and reformist administrations.[^125] His populist economic policies, including direct cash transfers and subsidy programs, provided tangible material benefits to millions of poor Iranians, even if these programs proved economically unsustainable in the long term.[^126] Defenders argue that his commitment to economic redistribution reflected authentic revolutionary values and a sincere concern for social justice, distinguishing him from elite politicians more concerned with maintaining their own privilege.[^127]

On Iran's nuclear program, supporters view Ahmadinejad's defiant stance as a principled defense of national sovereignty and Iran's right to scientific and technological development.[^128] They argue that his refusal to bow to Western pressure helped establish Iran's nuclear program as an irreversible achievement and prevented Iran from being bullied into abandoning its legitimate rights under international law.[^129] From this viewpoint, the sanctions and international pressure Iran endured were the price of defending national independence, and Ahmadinejad deserves credit for standing firm against tremendous external pressure.[^130]

Some scholars and analysts who have studied his presidency note that despite his inflammatory rhetoric, Ahmadinejad did not actually initiate any military conflicts or wars during his eight years in office.[^131] They argue that his confrontational language was primarily directed at domestic audiences and intended to rally nationalist sentiment rather than signal genuine military intentions.[^132] In this interpretation, Ahmadinejad was a more pragmatic leader than his rhetoric suggested, using inflammatory language for political purposes while generally avoiding actions that would trigger direct military confrontation with Western powers.[^133]

Defenders also point out that many of the economic problems attributed to Ahmadinejad—including inflation, unemployment, and budgetary difficulties—resulted at least partly from severe international sanctions rather than solely from his economic policies.[^134] They argue that any Iranian president who defended the nuclear program would have faced similar sanctions and economic difficulties, and that blaming Ahmadinejad personally for these problems ignores the external pressures Iran faced.[^135] Some economic analysts sympathetic to his administration argue that his cash transfer programs and subsidy reforms, while controversial, represented genuine attempts to address structural economic problems and modernize Iran's inefficient subsidy system.[^136]

In the cultural and ideological sphere, supporters view Ahmadinejad's emphasis on revolutionary values and resistance to Western cultural influence as preserving Iran's Islamic identity against secularization and Westernization.[^137] They see his promotion of traditional values, support for religious institutions, and resistance to Western cultural hegemony as defending authentic Iranian and Islamic culture against foreign domination.[^138] For those who share his worldview, Ahmadinejad represented a necessary corrective to the excessive Western orientation of some Iranian elites and intellectuals.[^139]

### Negative Views

Critics and opponents offer a sharply contrasting assessment of Ahmadinejad's presidency, viewing it as a period of missed opportunities, economic mismanagement, international isolation, and domestic repression. The violent suppression of the Green Movement following the disputed 2009 election represents, for many critics, the defining legacy of his presidency and an unforgivable betrayal of democratic principles.[^140] The deaths of protesters, mass arrests, torture of political prisoners, and years-long house arrest of opposition leaders Mousavi and Karroubi demonstrated the lengths to which his government would go to maintain power, contradicting any claims to represent popular will or democratic values.[^141]

Economic critics argue that Ahmadinejad squandered the windfall from high oil prices during the mid-2000s through misguided policies based on fundamental misunderstandings of economics.[^142] Professional Iranian economists' two open letters criticizing his policies reflected widespread expert consensus that his economic management was severely flawed.[^143] Rather than investing oil revenues in productive infrastructure or building reserves for future downturns, critics contend that he spent lavishly on unsustainable populist programs that created temporary political support but left the country in worse economic condition.[^144] The high inflation that characterized much of his presidency particularly hurt middle-class Iranians and those on fixed incomes, creating economic hardship that contradicted his populist rhetoric about helping the poor.[^145]

His Holocaust denial and inflammatory statements about Israel severely damaged Iran's international standing and made it easier for opponents to isolate Iran diplomatically.[^146] Historians and scholars almost universally condemn his Holocaust denial as historically ignorant, morally reprehensible, and politically counterproductive.[^147] Even many Iranians who opposed Israeli policies or supported Palestinian rights were embarrassed by Ahmadinejad's rhetoric, which they saw as needlessly provocative and damaging to Iran's interests.[^148] Critics argue that his statements on these topics reflected either profound ignorance or cynical political calculation to appeal to certain constituencies, neither of which speaks well of his leadership.[^149]

The growing militarization of Iran's economy under Ahmadinejad, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps gaining control of major sectors of the economy, created structural problems that outlasted his presidency.[^150] Critics view this development as creating an entrenched military-economic complex with interests in maintaining international tensions and opposing normalization of relations with the West, since sanctions and international isolation justified IRGC control of the economy.[^151] This militarization of economic life, critics argue, distorted resource allocation, increased corruption, and made economic reform more difficult for subsequent administrations.[^152]

His confrontational relationship with Supreme Leader Khamenei during his second term exposed him as a leader whose ambitions exceeded his political judgment and who was willing to challenge Iran's fundamental power structures for personal political advantage.[^153] Even many conservatives who initially supported him turned against him when he appeared to be building a power base independent of clerical authority, raising concerns about his ultimate intentions and loyalty to the Islamic Republic's system of clerical rule.[^154]

International relations experts argue that Ahmadinejad's confrontational rhetoric and policies, while appealing to some domestic constituencies, actually weakened Iran's regional and international position by uniting diverse opponents against it and foreclosing diplomatic opportunities that a more pragmatic approach might have exploited.[^155] The severe sanctions imposed during his tenure created economic hardships that fell disproportionately on ordinary Iranians rather than on the elites whose interests Ahmadinejad claimed to oppose, representing a fundamental policy failure.[^156]
