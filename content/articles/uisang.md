## Summary

Uisang (義湘, 625–702) was one of the most eminent early Silla Korean scholar-monks and the founder of the Hwaeom (華嚴, Chinese: Huayan) school of Korean Buddhism[^1]. After studying under the influential Chinese master Zhiyan at Mount Zhongnan alongside Fazang, who would become the third patriarch of the Huayan school, Uisang returned to Korea in 671 to establish Hwaeom Buddhism as the dominant intellectual tradition of the Unified Silla period[^2]. His most celebrated work, the Ocean Seal diagram (Haein-do), consisting of 210 Chinese characters arranged in a mandala-like pattern, distills the essence of Avatamsaka philosophy and remains widely studied in East Asian Buddhist circles today[^3]. Due largely to Uisang's efforts and royal patronage from King Munmu, Hwaeom philosophy came to dominate Korean Buddhist scholasticism and provided ideological support for the centralized political system of Unified Silla[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Uisang was born in 625 CE into the gentry class of Silla society during the reign of Queen Seondeok[^5]. Little is known of his early life other than that his father was named Hin-sin and his family name was Kim, indicating aristocratic lineage in Silla's bone-rank system[^6]. The seventh century was a tumultuous period in Korean history, as the Three Kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla competed for dominance on the peninsula. Buddhism had already established itself as a major cultural and religious force in Silla, having been officially adopted by the kingdom in 527 CE under King Beopheung[^7].

In 644 CE, at the age of nineteen during the thirteenth year of Queen Seondeok's reign, Uisang made the momentous decision to enter monastic life and was ordained as a monk at Hwangboksa (Hwangbok Temple) in Gyeongju, the capital of Silla[^8]. Some sources indicate he was ordained at age twenty-nine, suggesting he may have spent a decade as a novice before full ordination[^9]. At Hwangboksa, Uisang would have received training in Buddhist scriptures, meditation practices, and monastic discipline. It was during this period that he formed a close friendship with another young monk named Wonhyo (617–686), who would become one of the most celebrated thinkers in Korean Buddhist history[^10].

The two friends shared a burning ambition to study the most advanced Buddhist teachings being developed in Tang China, which had become the intellectual center of East Asian Buddhism. Chinese Buddhism was flourishing under imperial patronage, with sophisticated philosophical schools emerging around the great Mahayana sutras[^11]. For ambitious young Korean monks, traveling to China to study with the great masters was the path to the highest levels of Buddhist learning.

## Journey to China and Buddhist Studies

In 650 CE, Uisang and Wonhyo made their first attempt to reach Tang China[^12]. However, this initial journey ended in failure when the two monks were captured by border guards in the region of Baekje and held for ten days as suspected spies before being released and expelled[^13]. The geopolitical tensions between the Three Kingdoms and Tang China made travel extremely dangerous, especially for young men of military age who might be intelligence gatherers.

The most famous episode from this aborted journey involves Wonhyo's enlightenment experience that caused him to abandon the trip. According to the story preserved in the Samguk yusa (Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms), the two monks were caught in a heavy downpour somewhere in Baekje territory and took shelter in what they believed to be an earthen sanctuary[^14]. During the night, Wonhyo drank water from what he thought was a bowl. In the morning, he discovered it was actually an old skull filled with brackish water in what was actually a tomb. This realization triggered a profound insight: all phenomena arise from consciousness alone[^15]. Wonhyo concluded that it was unnecessary to travel abroad in search of truth when truth existed in one's own mind, and he turned back while Uisang pressed on alone—though this would have to wait another decade.

In 661 CE, at the age of thirty-six, Uisang finally succeeded in reaching Tang China[^16]. He traveled to Chang'an (modern Xi'an), the Tang capital, and from there to Mount Zhongnan (终南山) in Shaanxi province, one of the great centers of Chinese Buddhism. There he became a student of the venerable master Zhiyan (智儼, 602–668), who was recognized as the second patriarch of the emerging Huayan school of Buddhism[^17]. Huayan Buddhism centered on the Avatamsaka Sutra (Flower Garland Sutra), one of the most elaborate and philosophically sophisticated texts in the Mahayana canon, which presented a vision of reality as an infinite web of interpenetrating phenomena[^18].

At Mount Zhongnan's Zhixiang monastery, Uisang studied alongside another brilliant disciple of Zhiyan named Fazang (法藏, 643–712), who would later become the third patriarch of the Huayan school and its greatest systematizer[^19]. The two became close colleagues and established a lifelong friendship and correspondence that would continue even after Uisang returned to Korea. This relationship proved enormously fruitful for the development of Huayan philosophy in both China and Korea[^20].

Under Zhiyan's guidance, Uisang devoted himself to mastering the Avatamsaka Sutra and its complex philosophical system. The culmination of his studies was his composition of the Ocean Seal diagram (Haein-do, 海印圖), also known as the "Diagram of the Dharmadhatu of the One Vehicle of Hwaeom" (Hwaeom ilseung beopgye do, 華嚴一乘法界圖)[^21]. This remarkable work consisted of 210 Chinese characters arranged in a wavelike mandala pattern that symbolized the Hwaeom teaching of mutual interpenetration and the "six marks"—universality and particularity, identity and difference, integration and disintegration[^22].

According to the traditional account, Zhiyan had drawn seventy-two graphs attempting to capture the essence of the Ocean Seal samadhi described in the Avatamsaka Sutra. When Uisang presented his single diagram to his master, Zhiyan examined it carefully and declared: "This one Ocean Seal of yours is equal to my seventy-two seals. Your Ocean Seal is comprehensive, and mine is partial. The great meaning of Huayan does not dwell outside of your seal"[^23]. This recognition from the patriarch validated Uisang's profound understanding of Huayan doctrine and established his authority as a master of the teaching.

While in China, Uisang wrote his major treatise, "An Explanatory Diagram on the Garland World System," which elicited high acclaim from Zhiyan and would be studied widely in Buddhist circles throughout East Asia for centuries to come[^24]. After Zhiyan's death in 668 CE, Uisang emerged as one of the leaders of the developing Chinese Huayan tradition, though he would soon return to his homeland to plant the seeds of Hwaeom Buddhism in Korean soil[^25].

## Return to Korea and Establishment of Hwaeom School

In 670 CE, after nearly a decade of intensive study in China, Uisang returned to the Korean peninsula[^26]. His homecoming occurred at a pivotal moment in Korean history. Just two years earlier, in 668 CE, Silla had completed its conquest of Goguryeo with Tang Chinese assistance, thereby unifying the Three Kingdoms under Silla rule for the first time[^27]. However, tensions were already emerging between Silla and Tang China over the disposition of conquered territories.

According to tradition, Uisang's return was precipitated by intelligence he had gathered about Tang China's plans to invade Silla. He hurried back to warn King Munmu (reigned 661–681) of the impending threat[^28]. Whether or not this story is entirely accurate, what is certain is that Silla did successfully repel Tang forces in a series of conflicts from 670 to 676 CE, establishing Unified Silla as a truly independent Korean state[^29].

King Munmu, grateful for Uisang's service and recognizing the value of his Buddhist learning, became the monk's most important patron. In 676 CE, the king sponsored the construction of Buseoksa (浮石寺, "Floating Stone Temple") on Mount Taebaek and made Uisang its founding abbot[^30]. This monastery would become the center of Hwaeom studies in Korea and the institutional base from which Uisang would spread his teachings throughout the peninsula.

The name "Buseoksa" (Floating Stone Temple) derives from a remarkable legend involving Uisang and a Chinese woman named Shanmiao. According to the story preserved in the Samguk yusa and later elaborated in Japanese sources, Shanmiao was the daughter of a wealthy man in a Chinese port town who fell deeply in love with the handsome Korean monk when he came begging for alms[^31]. She confessed her feelings to Uisang, who kindly but firmly rejected her advances and even managed to convert her to Buddhism[^32].

When Uisang completed his studies and prepared to return to Korea, Shanmiao learned of his departure and rushed to the harbor with a collection of Buddhist implements she had gathered as gifts. But she arrived too late—Uisang's ship had already sailed. In her distress, Shanmiao threw the box of implements toward the ship and jumped into the sea, whereupon she miraculously transformed into a dragon and protected Uisang on his voyage home[^33]. Later, when Uisang was establishing his monastery, hostile monks already occupying the site challenged him. Shanmiao, appearing variously as a woman, a dragon, and finally as a massive stone, helped Uisang by hovering the rock above the monastery, frightening away his opponents. This floating stone gave Buseoksa its name[^34].

At Buseoksa, Uisang's fame as a teacher grew rapidly. According to traditional accounts, more than three thousand students congregated at the temple to hear his lectures on the Avatamsaka Sutra and Hwaeom philosophy[^35]. While this number may be exaggerated, it indicates the enormous influence Uisang wielded as a religious teacher. His most accomplished disciples became known as "Uisang's ten wise ones": masters Ojin, Jitong, Pyohun, Jinjeong, Jinjang, Doyung, Nangwon (or Yangwon), Sangwon, Neungin, and Uijeok[^36].

These ten principal disciples became the founders of what were known as the "Ten Hwaeom Temples" (Hwaeom Sipchal, 華嚴十刹) scattered throughout the Korean peninsula[^37]. While the exact list of temples has been disputed due to the ravages of history, confirmed members of this network include Buseoksa, Beomeosa Temple in Busan (founded by Uisang himself in 678), Hwaeomsa Temple in Gurye, Haeinsa Temple in Hapcheon (which would later house the Tripitaka Koreana), and several others[^38]. Through this network of temples and lineages, Uisang created an institutional structure that would sustain Hwaeom Buddhism in Korea for centuries.

## Major Achievements and Contributions

Uisang's most significant achievement was establishing Hwaeom Buddhism as the dominant philosophical tradition of Unified Silla and forging the doctrinal perspectives that would become characteristic of the mature Korean Buddhist tradition[^39]. His influence extended across multiple dimensions: philosophical, institutional, political, and cultural.

### Philosophical Contributions

At the heart of Uisang's philosophical work was his interpretation of Avatamsaka thought, which emphasized the mutual interpenetration and mutual containment of all phenomena. This doctrine, known in Sanskrit as interpenetration of Indra's net, held that any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality—its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other[^40]. This mutual containment was understood to be fractal in nature, such that even the smallest mote of dust contains the entirety of everything else, which in turn contains that same mote of dust, on and on ad infinitum, all simultaneously[^41].

Uisang expressed this vision most succinctly in his Ocean Seal diagram, which used 210 Chinese characters to express the essence of Huayan doctrine. The diagram's wavelike form symbolized the ocean seal samadhi, a state of meditative absorption in which all phenomena are reflected as clearly as images on a calm sea[^42]. The text could be read starting from any character and following the lines in any direction, always returning to the starting point—a formal expression of the teaching that "one is all, all is one. One is identical to all. All is identical to one"[^43].

The core teaching, as Uisang explained it, was that "as all things do not have Self Nature, each one unites with the other without obstacles. Therefore, each one consists of elements of everything else. As each one involves all in each, there are no obstacles"[^44]. This philosophical vision transcended the conventional distinction between the one and the many, between parts and wholes, presenting reality as a seamless web of mutual dependence and interpenetration.

### Literary Works

Beyond the Ocean Seal diagram and its autocommentary, Uisang composed several other important works. These included: "Abstract of Gandhavyuha Sutra" (Ipbeop gyepum chogi), "Contemplation on the Ten Immeasurable Revelations" (Hwaeom sipmun ganbeop gwan), "Explanation on the Sukhavativyuha Sutra" (Amitha gyeong uigi), "Entreaty to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas" (Jeban cheongmun), "Written Vows to Dedicate Baekhwa Monastery" (Baekhwa doryang Barwonmun), "A Written Statement of One's Vow to the One Vehicle of Hwaeom" (Hwaeom ilsung Barwonmun), and "Adoration of Teachers" (Tusarye)[^45]. While many of these texts have been lost, those that survive demonstrate Uisang's mastery of Buddhist doctrine and his ability to make complex philosophical ideas accessible to his students.

### Institutional Building

Uisang's sobriquet as the "Temple Builder" reflected his prodigious activity in establishing and expanding monasteries throughout Korea[^46]. Beyond Buseoksa and Beomeosa, which he founded directly, his disciples established numerous other temples that formed the network of Hwaeom institutions. This network provided the physical and social infrastructure for Buddhist education, practice, and cultural production throughout the Unified Silla period.

Each of these temples became a center for teaching, with Uisang's disciples and their successors training new generations of monks in Hwaeom philosophy. The temples also served as cultural centers, producing Buddhist art, calligraphy, and architecture that expressed Hwaeom principles. Many of these temples still exist today, preserving architectural and artistic treasures from the Silla and Goryeo periods.

### Political Influence

Uisang wielded considerable political influence at the Silla court, particularly during the reign of King Munmu. His relationship with the king went beyond that of a typical court monk; Uisang served as an advisor whose counsel carried significant weight. An illustrative example of this influence occurred when King Munmu repeatedly ordered the construction and restoration of fortresses, demanding labor services from the people[^47]. When Uisang heard of yet another fortress-building project, he sent a letter to the king containing his teaching: "If the king rules the people in the right way, even a fortress can be made out of just a line on the ground. Then people don't dare to cross the line and disaster will be changed into good fortune"[^48].

The king, who deeply respected Uisang, read the letter and immediately canceled the project, sparing the people from further labor burdens. This episode demonstrates not only Uisang's political influence but also his concern for the welfare of common people and his willingness to challenge royal policy when he deemed it harmful.

King Munmu offered Uisang a house and slaves in recognition of his services, but the monk refused, saying: "We, monks, treat people equally whether they be from noble class or below. How can I have slaves?"[^49] This principled stance against the ownership of human beings distinguished Uisang in an era when slavery was taken for granted, even within religious institutions.

### Ideological Support for Unified Silla

Beyond his personal influence with King Munmu, Uisang's Hwaeom philosophy provided crucial ideological support for the centralized political system of Unified Silla. According to Uisang's Avatamsaka thought, the myriad phenomena in the universe are ultimately one, interconnected in a perfect harmony centered on the fundamental principle (li) that pervades all[^50]. This philosophical vision proved highly suitable for supporting a centralized ruling system organized around a total monarchy, with the king serving as the earthly manifestation of the unifying principle that harmonized all of society[^51].

Hwaeom Buddhism came to predominate in the Korean peninsula precisely because it provided this ideological legitimation for the political system of Unified Silla, making Uisang's teaching not merely a philosophical or religious system but a key element of statecraft[^52]. This symbiotic relationship between Hwaeom Buddhism and the Silla state would continue throughout the dynasty's existence.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many historical figures of comparable influence, Uisang emerges from the historical record with remarkably little controversy attached to his name. The sources, both contemporary and later, present him almost uniformly in positive terms. However, several issues merit examination when considering a balanced assessment of his life and work.

### The "Heretic Monks" Episode

One of the few instances where Uisang appears in a potentially controversial light occurred in 676 CE when he arrived back in Korea and wished to establish a monastery at a particular location. According to the account, Uisang complained of "heretic" monks at the monastery he wished to move into[^53]. This episode raises questions about Uisang's attitude toward Buddhist practitioners who did not share his doctrinal views. The term "heretic" suggests he was willing to use harsh language against those he considered heterodox, though it's unclear whether these were monks from other Buddhist schools, practitioners of indigenous Korean religion, or simply monks whose behavior he found objectionable.

This incident is traditionally resolved in Uisang's hagiography through the intervention of Shanmiao, the dragon-woman who helped frighten away the occupying monks with the floating stone. While this supernatural element obscures the historical reality, it's clear that there was some conflict over the establishment of Buseoksa. Whether Uisang used political influence, persuasion, or other means to secure the site remains unknown.

### Relationship with Political Power

Uisang's close relationship with the Silla royal court, particularly King Munmu, raises questions about the degree to which his religious mission became entangled with political power. While Uisang refused personal rewards like slaves and lived an ascetic lifestyle, he readily accepted massive royal patronage for temple construction and the establishment of his school[^54]. This raises the perennial question of whether religious institutions can accept state support without compromising their independence and integrity.

Critics might argue that Uisang's Hwaeom philosophy, with its emphasis on hierarchical integration of phenomena under a single unifying principle, was tailored to support monarchical authority rather than representing a disinterested search for truth. The fact that Hwaeom "provided ideological support for the political system of the state of Unified Silla" could be interpreted as evidence that Uisang served the interests of power[^55].

However, defenders would note that Uisang was willing to challenge royal policy when he believed it harmed the people, as in the fortress-building episode. His refusal of slaves also suggests he maintained ethical standards that transcended political expediency. The question remains complex and admits of no simple answer.

### Limited Attention to Social Justice

While Uisang's refusal to own slaves indicates some concern for human equality, his overall focus remained on philosophical doctrine, monastic institution-building, and serving the elite rather than addressing the social inequalities of Silla society. The bone-rank system that structured Silla society was profoundly hierarchical, with one's birth status determining opportunities and legal rights throughout life[^56]. There is no evidence that Uisang challenged this system or worked to ameliorate the conditions of the lower classes.

His three thousand students and network of temples primarily served the aristocracy and monarchy. Unlike some later Korean Buddhist reformers who emphasized universal accessibility to enlightenment, Uisang's Hwaeom philosophy, with its emphasis on complex philosophical doctrine, remained largely the province of educated elites. This limited the social impact of his teaching and may have contributed to Buddhism's eventual vulnerability to Confucian criticism during the Joseon dynasty.

### Scholastic vs. Practical Emphasis

Some Buddhist practitioners, particularly those in the Seon (Zen) tradition that would emerge later, criticized the scholastic approach exemplified by Uisang's Hwaeom school. From this perspective, Uisang's emphasis on philosophical doctrine and textual study represented an intellectualization of Buddhism that moved away from the direct meditative experience emphasized by the Buddha. The elaborate philosophical systems of Hwaeom, critics argued, could become obstacles to enlightenment rather than aids[^57].

However, this criticism reflects later sectarian divisions within Korean Buddhism rather than controversies during Uisang's own lifetime. In the seventh century, the distinction between doctrinal study (gyo) and meditation practice (seon) had not yet hardened into competing schools, and Uisang's approach was entirely mainstream within the Buddhism of his era.

### Limited Extant Writings

A more practical criticism is that despite Uisang's reputation as a great scholar, relatively few of his writings have survived. While this is due to the vagaries of historical preservation rather than any fault of Uisang's, it makes it difficult for modern scholars to fully assess his philosophical contributions and compare them rigorously with those of his contemporaries like Wonhyo, whose extensive writings did survive[^58].

---

## Personal Life and Character

The historical sources provide only fragmentary glimpses into Uisang's personality and private life, focusing instead on his religious accomplishments. Nevertheless, these fragments reveal a figure of considerable complexity and admirable character.

### Ascetic Lifestyle

Despite his influence and the royal patronage available to him, Uisang maintained a strictly ascetic lifestyle throughout his life. In his later years, he "kept the precepts very strictly and so his only possessions were his robes and an alms bowl, lived an ascetic life, taught the philosophy of Avatamsaka (Hwaeom) and led the Buddhism of the Unified Silla Period to be very successful"[^59]. This austere approach to personal life contrasted sharply with the elaborate institutional infrastructure he built and the sophisticated philosophy he taught.

His refusal of King Munmu's offer of a house and slaves demonstrated that his asceticism was principled rather than merely performative. He could have easily rationalized accepting such gifts as necessary for his mission or as appropriate recognition of his status. Instead, he maintained the traditional Buddhist monk's simple lifestyle of poverty, showing that his commitment to Buddhist precepts was genuine and deep.

### Relationship with Wonhyo

Uisang's friendship with Wonhyo, formed during their time at Hwangboksa Temple, was one of the most significant relationships of his life. The two monks shared the ambition to study in China and made at least one failed attempt together. However, Wonhyo's enlightenment experience in the tomb led him to abandon the journey and pursue a different path, while Uisang pressed on to China[^60].

Despite taking very different approaches to Buddhism—Wonhyo's eclectic synthesis versus Uisang's focused Hwaeom specialization—the two remained close. Both contributed to establishing Buddhism as the dominant intellectual tradition of Unified Silla, with their teachings complementing each other. Their friendship and mutual respect became a model for later Korean Buddhist thinkers and demonstrated that different approaches to the dharma could coexist harmoniously.

### The Shanmiao Story and Celibacy

The legend of Shanmiao provides the only glimpse into Uisang's relationship with romantic love, albeit filtered through hagiographical legend. The story presents Uisang as an attractive figure who inspired passionate devotion but who remained committed to his monastic celibacy. His response to Shanmiao's confession—kind but firm rejection coupled with successful conversion—portrays him as compassionate yet unwavering in his vocation[^61].

Whether or not the story has any historical basis, its preservation and elaboration in both Korean and Japanese sources suggests it expressed something important about how Uisang was remembered: as a figure of charismatic power who inspired devotion that could be transformed from romantic to religious. The transformation of Shanmiao into a protective dragon-woman symbolized the sublimation of erotic energy into spiritual power in service of the dharma.

### Teaching Style and Relationships with Students

Uisang's ability to attract and train three thousand students indicates considerable skill as a teacher. His "ten wise ones" went on to establish major temples and lineages of their own, suggesting he was successful in identifying talent and nurturing it to maturity. The fact that his disciples sought his guidance on both doctrinal and practical matters, and that they preserved and transmitted his teachings faithfully, speaks to the depth of their respect and affection for him[^62].

The relationship between Uisang and his students appears to have followed the traditional East Asian pattern of the master-disciple bond, characterized by complete dedication on the disciple's part and comprehensive responsibility on the master's part. This model created strong lineage bonds that sustained the Hwaeom school across generations.

### Intellectual Character

Uisang's correspondence with Fazang, the future third patriarch of Chinese Huayan Buddhism, reveals his intellectual character. The fact that Fazang continued to send manuscripts to Uisang for correction even after returning to Korea demonstrates the high regard in which Uisang's scholarship was held[^63]. In one letter from 692, Fazang specifically asked for Uisang's corrections and suggestions on a manuscript, indicating that their relationship was one of genuine intellectual exchange rather than mere courtesy[^64].

This ongoing correspondence also reveals Uisang's continuing engagement with the development of Huayan thought in China even as he focused on establishing Hwaeom in Korea. He was not merely a transmitter of Chinese Buddhism to Korea but an active participant in the East Asian Buddhist intellectual community, influencing the development of Huayan philosophy in both countries.

### Concern for Common People

While Uisang's primary focus was on elite monks and aristocratic patrons, his intervention to halt King Munmu's fortress-building project reveals concern for the welfare of common people burdened by labor services. His letter to the king, teaching that righteous rule was more effective than military fortifications, combined Buddhist philosophy with practical political wisdom in service of reducing popular suffering[^65].

## Legacy and Historical Impact

Uisang's influence on Korean Buddhism and Korean culture more broadly extends far beyond his lifetime, shaping the development of religious, intellectual, and artistic traditions for more than a millennium.

### Hwaeom School's Dominance

Due largely to Uisang's efforts, Hwaeom philosophy came to dominate Korean Buddhist scholasticism during the Unified Silla period[^66]. His successful establishment of the school created an intellectual tradition that would shape Korean Buddhist thought for centuries. Even after Hwaeom ceased to exist as a separate school during the late Goryeo period, its principles were deeply assimilated into Korean Buddhism, particularly the Seon (Zen) school that eventually became dominant[^67].

The network of ten temples and lineages established by Uisang and his disciples provided institutional stability for Hwaeom Buddhism. These temples became centers not only of religious practice but also of scholarship, art, and culture. Several of them, including Buseoksa and Beomeosa, continue to function as active monasteries today, preserving living connections to Uisang's legacy across thirteen centuries.

### Influence on East Asian Buddhism

Uisang's influence extended beyond Korea to the broader East Asian Buddhist world. His Ocean Seal diagram became widely studied throughout China, Korea, and Japan. Japanese Kegon Buddhism (the Japanese pronunciation of Huayan/Hwaeom) preserved the Shanmiao legend in the illustrated scroll "Kegon engi emaki," demonstrating Uisang's importance to the Japanese tradition as well[^68].

Uisang's relationship with Fazang had lasting significance for the development of Chinese Huayan philosophy. Scholarly examination of Fazang's writings has revealed that Korean exegetes Uisang and Wonhyo exerted strong influence on the development of his thought, and by extension, on the evolution of Chinese Huayan philosophy[^69]. Thus Uisang was not merely a recipient of Chinese Buddhism but an active contributor to its development.

### Architectural and Artistic Legacy

The temples founded by Uisang and his disciples became showcases for Korean Buddhist architecture and art. Buseoksa, in particular, preserves architectural treasures from the Goryeo period, including the Muryangsujeon (Infinite Life Hall), one of the oldest surviving wooden structures in Korea. The temple was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018 as part of the "Sansa, Buddhist Mountain Monasteries in Korea" inscription[^70].

Artistic representations of Uisang, including portraits preserved at temples like Beomeosa, made him one of the most visually recognizable figures from Korean Buddhist history. The Ocean Seal diagram itself became an important artistic and calligraphic subject, with its unique wavelike form presenting both aesthetic and spiritual significance.

### Continuing Veneration

Uisang is commemorated annually at Buseoksa Temple through the Uisang Daeje ritual, held on March 3 of the lunar calendar. During this ceremony, monks and lay followers walk along the path of the Ocean Seal diagram while carrying wooden blocks of the Flower Garland Sutra on their heads and chanting sutras[^71]. This living ritual tradition maintains a direct connection between contemporary Korean Buddhists and Uisang's seventh-century teaching.

Many temples throughout Korea maintain shrines (josadang) dedicated to Uisang as their founder or lineage ancestor. These shrines serve as focal points for ritual veneration and historical memory, keeping Uisang's presence alive in Korean Buddhist practice.

### Scholarly Transmission

The Hwaeom school continued as a lively source of scholarship well into the Goryeo period (918-1392), with much of it continuing Uisang's legacy. The monk Gyunyeo (均如, 923-973) wrote an extensive commentary on Uisang's Ocean Seal diagram, incorporating the works of Uisang's disciples and their successors to re-unify and strengthen the Goryeo Hwaeom school[^72]. Later Hwaeom scholars including Danmun (900-975), Gyeoreung (964-1053), and Zhiqing (1113-1192) all built upon the foundation Uisang had established[^73].

Even during the Joseon era (1392-1910), when Confucian ideology became dominant and Buddhism faced persecution, Hwaeom thought continued to play a strong role within the Seon school, and various Hwaeom commentaries were produced[^74].

### Modern Korean Buddhism

Many modern Korean Buddhist schools continue to study Uisang's writings and teachings, recognizing their enduring relevance. Uisang's interpretation of Huayan philosophy, with its emphasis on the interpenetration of all phenomena, resonates with contemporary concerns about interconnection, ecology, and holistic thinking[^75]. His vision of reality as an infinite web of mutual dependence and mutual containment offers philosophical resources for addressing modern problems of fragmentation and alienation.

The Jogye Order, the dominant school of Korean Buddhism today, incorporates both Seon (meditation) and Gyo (doctrinal study) elements, with Hwaeom philosophy playing a significant role in the doctrinal curriculum. Thus Uisang's legacy continues to shape the education and practice of Korean Buddhist monks and nuns.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and practitioners have consistently recognized Uisang as one of the most important figures in Korean Buddhist history. He is credited as one of the key founders who helped forge the doctrinal perspectives that would become characteristic of the mature Korean Buddhist tradition[^76]. His role in establishing Hwaeom Buddhism as the dominant intellectual force of Unified Silla cannot be overstated.

The Britannica Encyclopedia identifies Uisang as a "Korean philosopher, scholar, and poet," highlighting his multifaceted contributions[^77]. His mastery of Huayan thought was highly regarded throughout East Asia, with his influence on Chinese Huayan philosophy through Fazang being particularly significant[^78]. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes that after Zhiyan's death in 668, Uisang became one of the leaders of the developing Chinese Huayan tradition, indicating his stature in the broader East Asian Buddhist world[^79].

Modern scholars emphasize Uisang's success in securing official patronage from the royal court and establishing institutional foundations for Hwaeom Buddhism[^80]. His title of "national teacher" (guksa) bestowed by the Silla court recognized his importance not merely as a religious figure but as a contributor to state ideology and political stability[^81].

The Ocean Seal diagram is praised as a masterwork of Buddhist thought and calligraphic art. Its status as a text "still read widely in the Buddhist circles of East Asia" more than thirteen centuries after its composition testifies to its enduring value[^82]. The diagram's formal properties—its ability to be read from any starting point, its wavelike mandala structure, its compression of vast philosophical content into 210 characters—are recognized as achievements of both philosophical insight and artistic expression.

Uisang's character receives consistent praise in the sources. His ascetic lifestyle, his refusal to own slaves, his principled intervention to prevent royal projects that burdened common people, and his devoted teaching of thousands of students all contribute to a portrait of admirable personal conduct. He is remembered as a figure who wielded considerable power and influence yet remained true to Buddhist precepts and concerned for others' welfare.

### Critical and Balanced Views

While overwhelmingly positive assessments dominate the historical record, more critical or balanced perspectives have emerged from modern scholarship. Some scholars note the limitations of Uisang's social vision, pointing out that his primary focus on elite monasticism and aristocratic patronage meant Hwaeom Buddhism remained largely inaccessible to ordinary people[^83]. This may have contributed to Buddhism's eventual vulnerability to Confucian criticism during the Joseon dynasty, when reformers attacked Buddhism for being parasitic on society and failing to contribute to social welfare.

The close relationship between Uisang's Hwaeom philosophy and the political ideology of Unified Silla raises questions about the independence of religious thought from political power. While this relationship was typical of premodern Asian Buddhism, it nevertheless invites scrutiny about whether Uisang's philosophy was shaped by political considerations or whether it represented a disinterested search for truth that happened to align with monarchical interests.

Some Buddhist practitioners in the Seon tradition have viewed the scholastic emphasis of Hwaeom Buddhism as an obstacle to direct enlightenment experience. While this criticism reflects later sectarian divisions rather than contemporary assessments of Uisang, it raises important questions about the role of philosophical doctrine in Buddhist practice. Can elaborate conceptual systems like Hwaeom philosophy lead practitioners toward enlightenment, or do they become intellectual barriers that must eventually be transcended?

The relatively limited number of Uisang's surviving writings makes it difficult to assess the full scope and originality of his thought. While the Ocean Seal diagram and its commentary are masterful works, they represent a relatively small corpus compared to the voluminous writings of figures like Wonhyo or Fazang. This makes it challenging to determine how much of Uisang's reputation rests on his role as an institutional founder and political figure versus his philosophical originality.

Nevertheless, even critical assessments acknowledge Uisang's fundamental importance to Korean Buddhist history. His success in transplanting Huayan Buddhism to Korea and adapting it to Korean circumstances created a philosophical tradition that would shape Korean thought for more than a millennium. His institutional achievements provided the infrastructure for Buddhist flourishing during the Unified Silla and Goryeo periods. And his personal example of combining rigorous scholarship with ascetic practice and social concern set a standard for Korean Buddhist monasticism.

## Famous Quotes and Teachings

### On Governance and Righteousness

> "If the king rules the people in the right way, even a fortress can be made out of just a line on the ground. Then people don't dare to cross the line and disaster will be changed into good fortune."

Written in a letter to King Munmu when the king was ordering construction of yet another fortress, this teaching exemplifies Uisang's political philosophy that righteous rule is more effective than military fortifications[^84].

### On the Hwaeom Teaching of Interpenetration

> "One is all, all is one. One is identical to all. All is identical to one."

This succinct expression of Hwaeom philosophy appears in Uisang's teaching on the Middle Way and mutual interpenetration of phenomena[^85].

### On Non-Obstruction

> "As all things do not have Self Nature, each one unites with the other without obstacles. Therefore, each one consists of elements of everything else. As each one involves all in each, there are no obstacles."

This teaching explains the philosophical basis for the Hwaeom doctrine of mutual interpenetration: because phenomena lack inherent self-nature, they can interpenetrate without obstruction[^86].

### Zhiyan's Recognition of Uisang

> "This one Ocean Seal of yours is equal to my seventy-two seals. Your Ocean Seal is comprehensive, and mine is partial. The great meaning of Huayan does not dwell outside of your seal."

Zhiyan's words upon seeing Uisang's Ocean Seal diagram, recognizing his student's mastery of Huayan philosophy[^87].

### On Monastic Equality

> "We, monks, treat people equally whether they be from noble class or below. How can I have slaves?"

Uisang's response when King Munmu offered him a house and slaves, demonstrating his commitment to Buddhist principles of equality and his refusal to participate in the institution of slavery[^88].
