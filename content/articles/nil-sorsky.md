## Summary

Nil Sorsky was a Russian Orthodox monk and mystic who founded the Non-Possessor movement, arguing that monasteries should own no property and monks should support themselves through manual labor. He traveled to Mount Athos and brought the Hesychast tradition of inner prayer to Russia. His debates with the Possessors (led by Joseph of Volokolamsk) defined Russian Orthodox spirituality for centuries.
