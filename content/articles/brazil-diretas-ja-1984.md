## Summary

Between March 1983 and April 1984, millions of Brazilians took to the streets demanding "Diretas Já!"—"Direct Elections Now!" The movement became the largest mass mobilization in Brazilian history, culminating in a São Paulo rally of over 1.5 million people on April 16, 1984. After 20 years of military dictatorship, Brazilians were demanding the right to choose their own president. Though the constitutional amendment to restore direct elections failed by just 22 votes, the movement fatally wounded the military regime and paved the way for Brazil's return to democracy.[^1]

The Diretas Já campaign united a society divided by two decades of authoritarian rule. Students, workers, artists, opposition politicians, and ordinary citizens found common cause in a simple demand: the vote. Polls showed 84% of Brazilians supported the amendment. Yellow became the movement's color—worn, waved, and painted across the nation. When Congress rejected the people's will, it delegitimized the military regime in ways that made its continued rule impossible.[^2]

## Historical Background

### Military Dictatorship (1964-1985)

Brazil had been under military rule since 1964:

- **1964 Coup:** Military overthrew President João Goulart
- **AI-5 (1968):** Harshest repression phase began
- **Anos de Chumbo:** "Years of Lead"; torture, censorship, disappearances
- **Indirect Elections:** Electoral college chose presidents; no popular vote
- **By 1983:** Regime weakening; gradual opening ("abertura") underway[^3]

### The Electoral System

Under the dictatorship:
- Presidents chosen by electoral college (Congress + state delegates)
- Controlled two-party system (ARENA vs. MDB)
- Opposition consistently unable to win indirect elections
- Direct elections for president last held in 1960

### Economic Crisis

**Early 1980s:**
- "Economic miracle" ended
- Hyperinflation
- Rising unemployment
- Foreign debt crisis
- Popular discontent growing[^4]

## The Movement

### Dante de Oliveira Amendment

**Deputy Dante de Oliveira** (PMDB, Mato Grosso) proposed a constitutional amendment to restore direct presidential elections.

**Amendment Details:**
- Modify Articles 74 and 148 of the 1967 Constitution
- Allow direct popular election of president and vice president
- Require two-thirds majority in Congress (320 of 479 votes)[^5]

### The Campaign (1983-1984)

**November 1983:** First rally in São Paulo (~15,000)

**January-April 1984:** Rallies grew exponentially
- Curitiba: 50,000
- Rio de Janeiro: 300,000+
- Belo Horizonte: 400,000
- São Paulo (April 16): **1.5 million** (largest in Brazilian history at that point)

**Participants:**
- Opposition parties (PMDB, PT, PDT)
- Trade unions
- Student organizations
- Artists and musicians
- Religious leaders
- Ordinary citizens of all classes[^6]

### The Color Yellow

Yellow became the movement's symbol:

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Moral Victory:** Though the amendment failed, Diretas Já demonstrated that the military regime had lost popular legitimacy. No government could claim democratic mandate after rejecting the overwhelming will of the people.[^10]

**Foundation for Transition:** The movement created the political conditions for the military's exit. Within a year, a civilian president would be chosen—even if indirectly.

### Critical Perspective

**Negotiated Transition:** Critics note that Brazil's return to democracy was controlled by elites. The indirect election of Tancredo Neves (who died before taking office) and José Sarney (former regime supporter) represented continuity as much as change.

### Long-Term Impact

Diretas Já showed the power of mass mobilization but also its limits when institutions remain controlled by authoritarian forces.[^11]

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate

**November 1984:** Electoral college elected Tancredo Neves (opposition) president
**April 1985:** Tancredo died before inauguration; José Sarney became president
**March 15, 1985:** First civilian president since 1964

### Long-Term

**1988:** New democratic constitution
**1989:** First direct presidential election in 29 years (Fernando Collor won)
**Democracy:** Continues to present, despite challenges

### The Question of Justice

Like other democratic transitions, Brazil's was negotiated:
- 1979 Amnesty Law protected military perpetrators
- No systematic prosecution of human rights violators
- Legacy of dictatorship remains contested[^12]

---

## Legacy

### For Brazil

- April 25 commemorated
- Yellow remains democracy's color
- Symbol of people power
- Generation politicized by Diretas Já shaped subsequent decades

### For Democracy

- Showed mass movements can delegitimize authoritarian regimes
- Demonstrated gap between formal failure and moral victory
- Model studied in democratization literature

### Unfinished Democracy

Diretas Já achieved democracy but not accountability. Brazil's transition was peaceful but also allowed continuity of military-era elites. The movement's spirit—direct participation, mass mobilization, demands for genuine democracy—returned in subsequent waves of protest (2013, 2015, etc.).[^13]
