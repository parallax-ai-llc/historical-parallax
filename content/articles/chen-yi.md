## Summary

Chen Yi (August 26, 1901 – January 6, 1972) was one of the ten founding Marshals of the People's Liberation Army and a prominent figure in the Chinese Communist Party.[^1] He served as Mayor of Shanghai from 1949 to 1958 and as Foreign Minister of China from 1958 to 1972, playing a crucial role in shaping early People's Republic of China foreign policy.[^2] Unlike most communist leaders, Chen Yi did not participate in the Long March, instead remaining behind to maintain guerrilla operations in southern China.[^3] During the Cultural Revolution, he courageously criticized the chaos and faced severe persecution, though he was ultimately vindicated when Mao Zedong attended his funeral in 1972.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Chen Yi was born on August 26, 1901, in Lezhi County near Chengdu, Sichuan Province, into a moderately wealthy magistrate's family.[^5] His birth into an educated family provided him with opportunities for formal schooling during his formative years, setting the foundation for his later intellectual and political development. Growing up in Sichuan during the late Qing Dynasty and early Republican period, Chen Yi witnessed firsthand the tumultuous social and political changes sweeping through China as the imperial system collapsed and warlordism emerged.

In 1919, at the age of eighteen, Chen Yi participated in the influential Diligent Work-Frugal Study Movement, traveling to France under a worker-student program sponsored by the Chinese government.[^6] This movement brought hundreds of young Chinese intellectuals to Europe, many of whom would later become leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and Zhu De.[^7] While in France, Chen Yi worked at the Michelin plant at Clermont-Ferrand, where he experienced industrial labor conditions firsthand.[^8]

Chen Yi's time in France proved transformative. He complained that factory life had nothing to do with the ideals of equality, freedom, and fraternity supposedly characteristic of French society, noting that it had shown him the "evil nature" of European capitalism at first hand.[^9] This disillusionment with Western capitalism and exposure to Marxist theory during his time in Europe radicalized him politically. Among the radical students who came to France in 1919 were Cai Hesen, Chen Yi, Li Fuchun, and Cai Chang, all friends of Mao Zedong from Hunan province.[^10]

Chen Yi remained in France from 1919 to 1921, and it was during this period that many Chinese students first became acquainted with, and converted to, Marxism.[^11] Upon his return to China, he continued his political activities, and in 1923, he formally joined the Chinese Communist Party, beginning his lifelong commitment to the revolutionary cause.[^12] His early experiences in France and exposure to both industrial capitalism and Marxist ideology would profoundly shape his worldview and his approach to China's revolutionary transformation.

## Rise to Power

Chen Yi's ascent within the Chinese Communist Party and military hierarchy began in earnest in 1928 when he joined the newly formed Fourth Red Army under the leadership of Mao Zedong and Zhu De, the founder of the Chinese communist army.[^13] This decision placed him at the heart of the communist military movement during its formative period. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Chen Yi participated in building the Jiangxi Soviet, the largest communist-controlled territory in southern China.

Unlike most senior communist leaders, Chen Yi did not participate in the Long March of 1934-1935, in which the communists were forced to transfer their base of power from south-central to northwest China.[^14] Instead, he was left behind with a small rear guard force to keep alive the guerrilla movement in the south. For approximately three years, Chen Yi led guerrilla operations in the mountainous regions of southern Jiangxi and neighboring provinces, facing constant Nationalist military pressure while operating in isolation from the main Communist forces.[^15] This period of guerrilla warfare was extremely difficult, with his forces constantly hunted by Nationalist troops, facing starvation and disease. Chen Yi later wrote a poem during this period which he thought would be his last, as he had been wounded, his troops were starving, and they were surrounded by Nationalists.[^16]

When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out in mid-1937, Chen Yi's guerrilla forces were incorporated into the New Fourth Army, the major communist force in central China, which fought throughout the war in the lower Yangtze River valley.[^17] In 1941, following the New Fourth Army Incident—a violent clash between Communist and Nationalist forces—Chen Yi became acting commander and later full commander of the New Fourth Army, replacing Ye Ting.[^18] This promotion elevated him to one of the most important military positions in the Communist movement.

As commander of the New Fourth Army, Chen Yi achieved fame among Communist leadership by turning the near defeat at the Battle of Huangqiao in October 1940 into a stunning Communist victory.[^19] Chen Yi and Su Yu commanded forces that destroyed the Nationalist 89th Army and 33rd Division, killing more than 10,000 Kuomintang troops and capturing huge quantities of arms and ammunition.[^20] This victory demonstrated Chen Yi's tactical brilliance and established his reputation as one of the Communist Party's most capable military commanders.

## Major Achievements

Chen Yi's military achievements during the Chinese Civil War (1946-1949) were instrumental in the Communist victory over the Nationalist forces. He and Su Yu spearheaded the Shandong counter-offensive during the Chinese Civil War, demonstrating exceptional strategic coordination.[^21] In May 1947, Chen Yi, as commander of the East China Field Army, and Su Yu, his deputy commander and primary tactical planner, won a great victory in the Menglianggu Campaign, successfully encircling and annihilating the Nationalist 74th Division, considered one of Chiang Kai-shek's best units.[^22] This battle was a major turning point in the Shandong theater of the civil war.

In 1948, Chen Yi commanded Communist armies during the decisive Huaihai Campaign, one of the three major campaigns that sealed the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War.[^23] The campaign, coordinated with other commanders like Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping, resulted in the destruction or capture of over 500,000 Nationalist troops and opened the way for the eventual Communist conquest of all of mainland China. Following this victory, Chen Yi's forces conquered the lower Yangtze region in 1948-49, culminating in the capture of Shanghai, China's largest city and economic center, in May 1949.[^24]

After the communist takeover in 1949, Chen Yi became mayor of Shanghai, serving from 1949 to 1958.[^25] After the capture of Shanghai, he remained in the city to oversee economic stabilization and reconstruction.[^26] His governance involved implementing the 1951 suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the 1952 Three-Antis and Five-Antis movements targeting corruption and capitalist excesses, which facilitated the gradual nationalization of industry and commerce, transforming Shanghai's bourgeois economy into a state-controlled system.[^27] Under Chen Yi's leadership, Shanghai's municipal government aligned with national policies, implementing land reforms in suburban areas that redistributed property from landlords to peasants, collectivizing agriculture by the mid-1950s.[^28]

Chen Yi was named one of the ten Marshals of the People's Liberation Army in 1955, China's highest military rank, alongside Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao, Liu Bocheng, He Long, Luo Ronghuan, Xu Xiangqian, Nie Rongzhen, and Ye Jianying.[^29] He was made a member of the ruling Politburo in 1956, further consolidating his position within the Party leadership.[^30] In 1958, Chen Yi succeeded Zhou Enlai as Foreign Minister, a position he held until 1972, making him responsible for China's foreign relations during one of the most turbulent periods in modern Chinese history.[^31]

As Foreign Minister, Chen Yi played a crucial role in shaping China's foreign policy during the 1960s. He championed the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in China's relations with Asian and African countries, emphasizing mutual respect, non-aggression, and peaceful coexistence.[^32] Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice-Premier Chen Yi toured multiple Asian and African countries together in 1960 and 1963-1964, building diplomatic relationships with newly independent nations and positioning China as a supporter of the Non-Aligned Movement and Third World causes.[^33]

Chen Yi signed the Sino-Pakistan Border Agreement on March 2, 1963, alongside Pakistan's Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, resolving territorial disputes and strengthening Sino-Pakistani relations.[^34] He expressed China's policy on supporting revolutions abroad in 1963, stating that "China will support revolutions both morally and politically. We are Marxists. We must support them ... But it must be noted, Chinese troops will not cross our borders to advance revolution."[^35] This statement reflected China's attempt to balance ideological commitments with pragmatic foreign policy constraints.

Chen Yi also played a significant role in China's nuclear weapons program. He strongly supported the development of nuclear capabilities, stating "at present I still do not have adequate backup. If you succeed in producing the atomic bomb and guided missiles, then I can straighten my back."[^36] In 1956, Chen Yi was among hundreds of experts called by Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, and Nie Rongzhen to make plans for China's scientific development, creating an outline for the period from 1956 to 1967.[^37] China conducted its first nuclear test on October 16, 1964, significantly enhancing China's diplomatic standing.[^38]

Beyond his military and political roles, Chen Yi was also known as a poet who wrote traditional Chinese poetry, particularly ci poetry, a metrical form popular in the late Qing dynasty.[^39] His literary pursuits demonstrated the multifaceted nature of his intellect and his connection to Chinese cultural traditions.

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Chen Yi achieved significant military and diplomatic successes, his career was not without controversies and criticisms. As Mayor of Shanghai, his implementation of the Three-Antis and Five-Antis movements and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaigns led to widespread arrests, public trials, and executions, creating an atmosphere of fear and political persecution in the city.[^40] The gradual nationalization of industry and commerce, while aligned with socialist ideology, disrupted Shanghai's economy and affected countless businesspeople and entrepreneurs who lost their enterprises.

Chen Yi's foreign policy positions also attracted criticism from various quarters. His handling of Sino-Indian relations in the early 1960s contributed to the deterioration of relations between the two nations. Chen Yi expressed frustration with India's insistence on colonial-era boundary documents, telling Indian officials that settling the boundary required "shaking off the influences left over by the imperialists and create a new friendly border."[^41] By mid-1962, as tensions escalated, Foreign Minister Chen Yi commented at a high-level meeting that "Nehru's forward policy is a knife," reflecting increasingly hostile attitudes.[^42] After the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Chen Yi argued that India had "betrayed Afro-Asian unity" and that India's conduct at the Sino-Indian border was "arbitrary" and revealed Nehru's "expansionist ambitions."[^43]

Chen Yi's position on nuclear proliferation also raised concerns. He stated that nuclear proliferation was not a concern because the chances of war would be reduced if more countries had nuclear weapons, a view that contrasted sharply with international efforts to limit nuclear proliferation.[^44] Like other Chinese policymakers, Chen Yi viewed the July 1963 Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty as demonstrating a US-USSR re-alignment against China, contributing to China's international isolation during this period.[^45]

During the Cultural Revolution, Chen Yi became one of the most vocal critics of the radical policies implemented by the Red Guards and the Cultural Revolution Group. In February 1967, he was one of the most vocal leaders in the February Countercurrent, which criticized the Cultural Revolution for creating social disorder and undermining China's leadership.[^46] When Chen Yi, then serving as Foreign Minister, criticized the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, Mao Zedong sidelined him and the Red Guards occupied the Foreign Ministry.[^47]

Chen Yi was bitterly attacked in 1966 during the Cultural Revolution and dropped from the Politburo at the Ninth Party Congress in 1969, though he remained a member of the Central Committee and retained most of his other offices.[^48] He fought against the counter-revolutionary group of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing during the Cultural Revolution and suffered harsh persecution.[^49] During the Three Evils Movement, Chen Yi had stated: "It was all right for us to issue orders for so many years, wouldn't it be all right now to let our subordinates criticize us for a while, say for a week?"—a statement that reflected both his pragmatism and his willingness to accept criticism, qualities that made him vulnerable during the Cultural Revolution's witch hunts.[^50]

---

## Personal Life

Chen Yi married Zhang Qian (also romanized as Zhang Ch'ien), and they had several children together.[^51] One of their sons, Chen Haosu, became president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and later made headlines in 2013 when he issued a public apology for his role during the Cultural Revolution, reflecting on the violence and persecution that occurred during that period.[^52] Chen Haosu also co-authored "Selected Poems of Chen Yi," published in 2011, which collected his father's poetry in both Chinese and English, preserving Chen Yi's literary legacy.[^53]

Chen Yi was known for his cultural sophistication and appreciation for traditional Chinese arts. He wrote traditional Chinese poetry throughout his life, using poetry as a form of personal expression and as a way to signal his literacy and connection to Chinese intellectual traditions.[^54] Marshal Chen Yi once described Huaxi scenery as "true mountain water is everywhere, the layout of Huaxi, Huaxi will be more natural," demonstrating his appreciation for natural beauty and traditional Chinese aesthetics.[^55]

His personality was characterized by a combination of military toughness and cultural refinement. Unlike some of his more doctrinaire colleagues, Chen Yi maintained interests in literature, poetry, and the arts throughout his revolutionary career. His experiences in France exposed him to Western culture and thought, while his deep grounding in Chinese traditions gave him a unique perspective among Communist leaders. He was known for being outspoken and willing to voice his opinions, even when they contradicted prevailing political winds—a trait that served him well during wartime but made him vulnerable during political campaigns.

Chen Yi's relationship with Mao Zedong was complex and evolved over time. While Mao clearly respected Chen Yi's military capabilities and appointed him to high positions, their relationship became strained during the Cultural Revolution when Chen Yi criticized the chaos and disorder. Despite the persecution Chen Yi faced during the Cultural Revolution, Mao's attendance at his funeral in 1972 demonstrated the enduring respect Mao held for the old revolutionary guard.[^56]

---

## Legacy

Chen Yi died on January 6, 1972, in Beijing.[^57] His death marked the end of an era for the founding generation of Communist military commanders. What made his funeral particularly significant was that Mao Zedong personally attended it—a rare gesture during this period and Mao's last public appearance, as well as his first appearance at anyone's funeral during the Cultural Revolution.[^58] Mao's presence at the funeral was interpreted as a posthumous vindication of Chen Yi and a message about Mao's respect for the old revolutionary veterans who had been persecuted during the Cultural Revolution.

Chen Yi's military legacy is substantial. His guerrilla operations in southern China during the late 1930s demonstrated his ability to sustain resistance under extremely difficult conditions. His transformation of the near defeat at the Battle of Huangqiao into a stunning victory showcased his tactical brilliance.[^59] His command during the Menglianggu Campaign and the Huaihai Campaign helped secure Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, with his forces playing crucial roles in conquering eastern and central China.[^60]

As Mayor of Shanghai from 1949 to 1958, Chen Yi oversaw the transformation of China's largest city from a capitalist commercial center to a socialist industrial hub.[^61] His governance established the political and economic structures that would shape Shanghai for decades, though his methods also reflected the harsh realities of revolutionary transformation, including political persecution and economic disruption.

Chen Yi's tenure as Foreign Minister from 1958 to 1972 occurred during a period of significant international challenges for China, including the Sino-Soviet split, tensions with India, and China's international isolation.[^62] While his diplomatic achievements were mixed, he helped establish relationships with developing nations in Asia and Africa, signed important border agreements with Pakistan, and represented China during its development as a nuclear power. His statement on China's support for revolution—offering moral and political support while explicitly ruling out military intervention—reflected a pragmatic approach to balancing ideological commitments with national interests.[^63]

The fact that Chen Yi was the only marshal who did not participate in the Long March yet still achieved the highest military rank demonstrates the Party's recognition of his contributions during the guerrilla warfare period and the Anti-Japanese War.[^64] His courage in criticizing the Cultural Revolution, despite knowing the risks, exemplified his commitment to what he believed was right, even when it conflicted with prevailing political trends.

Chen Yi's literary legacy, preserved in his poetry, provides insight into his inner world and cultural sophistication.[^65] His dual identity as both warrior and poet, revolutionary and scholar, made him a unique figure among Communist leaders. His son Chen Haosu's public apology for Cultural Revolution-era violence in 2013 also contributed to public discourse about accountability and historical memory in China.[^66]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessments of Chen Yi generally recognize him as one of the outstanding Chinese communist military commanders of the 1930s and 1940s.[^67] Military historians praise his tactical abilities, particularly his management of guerrilla operations in southern China when isolated from the main Communist forces, and his transformation of potential military disasters into victories through creative tactics and strong leadership. His performance at the Battle of Huangqiao and during the Huaihai Campaign demonstrated exceptional military capability.[^68]

Chen Yi's role in the February Countercurrent has been reassessed more positively in recent decades, with scholars recognizing his courage in speaking out against the excesses of the Cultural Revolution at great personal risk.[^69] His willingness to criticize chaos and disorder, even when such criticism was politically dangerous, is now viewed as evidence of his integrity and commitment to China's institutional stability. The fact that Mao Zedong attended his funeral is interpreted by many scholars as Mao's implicit acknowledgment that Chen Yi had been unjustly persecuted.[^70]

As a diplomat, Chen Yi is credited with helping to establish China's relationships with developing nations during the 1960s, contributing to China's emergence as a significant player in the Non-Aligned Movement and among Third World countries.[^71] His work on border agreements, particularly with Pakistan, helped stabilize China's western frontiers. His support for China's nuclear program is viewed by some scholars as a pragmatic recognition that nuclear weapons were necessary for China's security and diplomatic standing during the Cold War.[^72]

Chen Yi's cultural sophistication and his dual identity as both military commander and poet have led some scholars to view him as representing a continuity with traditional Chinese literati-officials, who combined martial and cultural accomplishments.[^73] His work in transforming Shanghai from a capitalist to a socialist city, while harsh in methods, is seen by supporters as a necessary step in China's revolutionary transformation.

### Negative Views

Critics point to Chen Yi's role in implementing harsh political campaigns as Mayor of Shanghai, including the suppression of counter-revolutionaries and the Three-Antis and Five-Antis movements, which resulted in numerous executions, imprisonments, and the persecution of innocent people.[^74] These campaigns created an atmosphere of fear and destroyed many lives, with critics arguing that Chen Yi bears responsibility for the excesses committed under his authority.

Chen Yi's handling of Sino-Indian relations is criticized by some scholars as contributing to the deterioration of relations between the two nations and the outbreak of the 1962 Sino-Indian War.[^75] His harsh rhetoric about India—including comments that Nehru's policies revealed "expansionist ambitions"—is seen as inflammatory and unhelpful to diplomatic resolution. Critics argue that his approach to India prioritized ideological considerations over pragmatic diplomacy, contributing to lasting tensions between the two Asian giants.

His position on nuclear proliferation—arguing that more countries possessing nuclear weapons would reduce the chances of war—is viewed by critics as dangerously naive and contrary to international peace efforts.[^76] This stance is seen as evidence of ideological rigidity overriding practical considerations about global security.

Some scholars criticize Chen Yi's role in the economic transformation of Shanghai, arguing that the forced nationalization of businesses destroyed productive enterprises, disrupted economic activity, and caused unnecessary suffering to business owners and entrepreneurs who had built Shanghai's prosperity.[^77] The collectivization of agriculture in Shanghai's suburban areas is also criticized for reducing agricultural productivity and causing hardship to farmers.

While Chen Yi's criticism of the Cultural Revolution is now viewed more sympathetically, some contemporary critics argued that as a senior Party leader, he bore partial responsibility for creating the political system that made such chaos possible. His earlier participation in political campaigns and purges established precedents that were later turned against him and other veteran leaders during the Cultural Revolution.[^78]
