## Summary

Gérard Mourou is a French physicist who shared the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics with Donna Strickland for the invention of chirped pulse amplification. This technique for generating high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses opened new areas of research and practical applications including corrective eye surgery. He also developed the technique of optical stretching. His work made possible the creation of the most intense laser pulses ever generated.
