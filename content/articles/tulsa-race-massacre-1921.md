## 1. Introduction: The Hidden Holocaust
The **Tulsa Race Massacre** of 1921 is one of the single most destructive acts of racial violence in American history. For decades, it was buried under the euphemism of a "race riot," implying equal blame. In reality, it was a state-sanctioned pogrom where a deputized white mob, aided by the National Guard and private aircraft, systematically destroyed the wealthiest Black community in the United States.

## 2. Historical Context: A Tale of Two Cities
### The Oil Boom and Segregation
By 1921, Tulsa was the "Oil Capital of the World." The oil boom created immense wealth, but strict Jim Crow laws ensured that not a penny of white money crossed the tracks into the Black community.
*   **Greenwood's Rise:** Forced to be self-sufficient, the Black community of Greenwood built its own economy. O.W. Gurley, a wealthy Black landowner, bought 40 acres in 1906 under the principle "for Black people, by Black people."
*   **"Black Wall Street":** By 1921, Greenwood had a population of 10,000. It boasted:
    *   The **Stradford Hotel**, the largest Black-owned hotel in the US.
    *   Two newspapers (*The Tulsa Star*, *The Oklahoma Sun*).
    *   A public library, a hospital (Frissell Memorial), and an impeccable school system.
    *   15 resident doctors, 12 dentists, and numerous lawyers.
    *   Booker T. Washington famously coined the term "Negro Wall Street" (later Black Wall Street) because a dollar circulated within the community 36 to 100 times before leaving.

### The Social Powder Keg
*   **The Red Summer:** The post-WWI era was marked by racial violence (the "Red Summer" of 1919). Black soldiers returned from Europe expecting the democracy they fought for, while white supremacists (and a resurgent KKK) were determined to enforce the status quo.
*   **Resentment:** Many poor whites in Tulsa lived in squalor and deeply resented the visible affluence of Greenwood's residents, calling it "Nigger-town" in derision.

## 3. The Catalyst: May 30-31, 1921
### The Elevator Incident
On Memorial Day, **Dick Rowland** (19), a Black shoeshiner, entered the Drexel Building to use the only toilet allowed for Blacks on the top floor. He entered the elevator operated by **Sarah Page** (17).
*   **The Accident:** Most historians agree Rowland tripped and grabbed Page’s arm. She screamed. A clerk saw Rowland flee and assumed attempted rape. Page never pressed charges.
*   **The Media Incitement:** The *Tulsa Tribune*, a sensationalist paper, ran the headline on May 31: **"Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in an Elevator."** While the original copy has been destroyed, eyewitnesses recall a vile editorial titled **"To Lynch Negro Tonight,"** which effectively served as a muster call for the mob.

### The Standoff at the Courthouse
*   **The Lynch Mob:** By 7:30 PM on May 31, hundreds of white men gathered at the courthouse demanding Rowland. Sheriff Willard McCullough refused to hand him over, barricading Rowland on the top floor.
*   **The Defenders:** Hearing of the lynch mob, 30 armed Black men (many WWI veterans) arrived to offer help. They were turned away. Later, fearing the Sheriff would cave, a larger group of 75 Black men returned.
*   **The Trigger:** A white man confronted a Black veteran, demanding his pistol. When refused, he grabbed the gun. A shot went off. The white mob, numbering nearly 2,000 and primed for violence, opened fire.

## 4. The Massacre: June 1, 1921
### The Invasion of Greenwood
The Black defenders retreated across the Frisco railroad tracks into Greenwood. The white mob, now leaderless and growing, looted downtown hardware stores for guns and ammunition.
*   **Official Complicity:** Police officers began "deputizing" members of the mob. One witness heard an officer tell the mob: *"Get a gun and get a nigger."* This gave the rioters legal immunity.
*   **The Dawn Assault:** At 5:08 AM, a whistle blew (possibly a siren). The white mob, now numbering thousands, surged across the railroad tracks.
*   **Systematic Arson:** They moved block by block. They ordered residents out of their homes at gunpoint, looted money and jewelry, and then lit the draperies on fire. Those who fled were shot.

### The Aerial Bombing
Tulsa is unique in being the first American city bombed from the air.
*   **The Planes:** At least six private biplanes took off from a nearby airfield.
*   **The Payload:** Official accounts claimed they were for "reconnaissance," but numerous survivors (including Buck Colbert Franklin) described planes raining bullets down on fleeing refugees and dropping incendiary balls (turpentine or nitroglycerin) onto rooftops to spread the fire faster.

### High-Profile Murders
*   **Dr. A.C. Jackson:** A prominent surgeon, Dr. Jackson emerged from his house with his hands up to surrender to a group of white men. He was shot in the chest and bled to death.
*   **The Church:** Mount Zion Baptist Church, a symbol of Black wealth that had just been dedicated weeks earlier, was burned to the ground. Rumors claimed it was an armory, but no weapons were found.

## 5. Aftermath and Internment
### The National Guard
When the National Guard arrived from Oklahoma City, they did not arrest the arsonists. Instead, they arrested the victims.
*   **Martial Law:** Major J.B.A. Robertson declared martial law.
*   **Concentration Camps:** 6,000 Black Tulsans were forcibly marched to detention centers (the Convention Hall, the Fairgrounds, and McNulty Park). They were held under armed guard for up to eight days.
*   **The Green Card System:** To be released, a white citizen had to vouch for a Black detainee and sign a card accepting responsibility for their behavior. This turned the free citizens of Greenwood into temporary serfs.

### Casualties and Loss
*   **Human Toll:** The Tulsa Tribune initially reported 9 dead. The Red Cross reported 300 hospitalized. The 2001 Commission estimated **100 to 300 deaths**.
*   **Property Toll:** 35 square blocks were incinerated. 1,256 homes, 21 churches, 21 restaurants, 30 grocery stores, 2 movie theaters, and a hospital were destroyed.
*   **Financial Loss:** Estimates of property damage run between $1.5 million and $2 million in 1921 dollars—equivalent to over **$25 million** today. Generational wealth was instantly vaporized.

## 6. The Century of Silence
### The Cover-Up
*   **Legal:** A grand jury indicted 85 people—mostly African Americans. No white person was ever served a prison sentence for the murders or arson.
*   **Insurance:** Insurance companies used "Riot Exclusion Clauses" to deny all claims. Residents received $0.
*   **Erasure:** The event was scrubbed from history. The *Tulsa Tribune* removed the inciting pages from its bound archives. Oklahoma history textbooks did not mention the massacre until the late 1990s. Survivors taught their children to stay silent for fear it would happen again.

### Modern Reckoning
*   **The 2001 Commission:** The state finally investigated, concluding that the city and state bore responsibility. It recommended reparations.
*   **Reparations Denied:** Despite the recommendation, the Oklahoma legislature refused to pay reparations. A federal lawsuit filed by survivors was dismissed in 2004 due to the statute of limitations.
*   **2020 Excavation:** Scientists began digging in Oaklawn Cemetery. In October 2020, they found a mass grave containing at least 12 coffins. Forensics examined a gunshot wound in one set of remains, providing the first physical evidence of the murders denied for a century.
*   **Last Survivors:** As of 2024, the legal battle continues for the last few survivors (Mother Randle, Viola Fletcher), seeking damages for the "public nuisance" created by the massacre.
