## Summary

Johann Sebastian Bach (March 31, 1685 – July 28, 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period, widely regarded as one of the greatest composers in the history of Western music.[^1][^2] Born in Eisenach into a renowned musical family, Bach mastered virtually every musical form of his era, creating an extraordinary body of work that includes the Brandenburg Concertos, The Well-Tempered Clavier, the Mass in B Minor, and over 200 sacred cantatas.[^3][^4] A devout Lutheran who inscribed "Soli Deo Gloria" (to God alone the glory) on his compositions, Bach viewed music as a means of glorifying God and served for 27 years as Thomaskantor in Leipzig until his death.[^5][^6] Though largely forgotten after his death, his music was revived in the 19th century by Felix Mendelssohn and has since profoundly influenced generations of composers across all musical genres.[^7][^8]

## Early Life and Background

Johann Sebastian Bach was born on March 21, 1685 (March 31, New Style/Gregorian calendar) in Eisenach, the capital of the duchy of Saxe-Eisenach, in present-day Germany.[^1][^9] He was the eighth and youngest child of Johann Ambrosius Bach, the director of the town musicians, and Maria Elisabeth née Lämmerhirt, daughter of a town councillor.[^10] The Bach family, traditionally traced to the patriarch Vitus "Veit" Bach (d. 1619), produced three to four generations of musicians in the Thuringia region, making music an integral part of young Johann Sebastian's upbringing.[^11]

When Bach was eight years old in 1693, he entered the Eisenach Latin school, attending at the same time as two of his brothers and two of his cousins.[^12] Though nothing is definitively known about Bach's early years before 1693, he may have picked up the rudiments of string playing from his father, and no doubt attended the Georgenkirche, where Johann Christoph Bach served as organist until 1703.[^13] Tragedy struck Bach's childhood when he lost a brother and sister in early years, and his mother died when he was only nine years old in 1694.[^14] Nine months later in February 1695, his father died, leaving the young Bach orphaned at age ten.[^15]

Following his parents' deaths, Bach was taken in by his eldest brother, Johann Christoph Bach (1671–1721), organist at Ohrdruf, who had been a pupil of the influential keyboard composer Johann Pachelbel.[^16] This Christoph apparently gave Johann Sebastian his first formal keyboard lessons, providing critical musical education during Bach's formative years.[^17] Growing up in Eisenach, a town steeped in Lutheran tradition as the place where Martin Luther translated the New Testament, profoundly shaped Bach's worldview and his belief that all of life—including music—could be an act of worship.[^18] The combination of family musical tradition, formal education, and deep religious roots in this provincial German town laid the foundation for one of history's most remarkable musical careers.

## Rise to Prominence

Bach's professional career began modestly but steadily ascended through a series of increasingly prestigious positions across central Germany. In 1703, at age 18, he was invited to inspect the new organ and give the inaugural recital at the New Church (now Bach Church) in Arnstadt, and on August 14, 1703, he became the organist there with light duties, a relatively generous salary, and a new organ tuned in a temperament that allowed music written in a wider range of keys to be played.[^19][^20] During this period, a famous extended leave allowed him to walk over 250 miles to Lübeck to hear the renowned organist Dieterich Buxtehude, significantly influencing his own compositional style.[^21]

In 1706, Bach applied for a post as organist at the Blasius Church in Mühlhausen, performing a cantata at Easter on April 24, 1707 as part of his application.[^22] His application was accepted a month later with a salary of 85 gulden, offering higher remuneration, improved conditions, and a better choir than his Arnstadt position.[^23] Four months after arriving at Mühlhausen in 1707, Bach married Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin, beginning his family life.[^24] However, Bach left Mühlhausen after just one year in 1708, returning to Weimar as organist and from 1714 as Konzertmeister (director of music) at the ducal court.[^25]

At Weimar, the duke of Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst, appointed Bach chamber musician and court organist in 1708 and later his concertmaster in 1714—a position which entailed composing new music every month.[^26][^27] This period proved highly productive for Bach's compositional development, as he came into contact with Italian music and was particularly influenced by Vivaldi's concertos, even arranging some for keyboard as a way of studying their formal structure.[^28][^29] However, in 1717 Bach fell out of favor in Weimar, and when he attempted to leave for a better position with Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Köthen, he was arrested on November 6, 1717, for "obstinately demanding his instant dismissal" and imprisoned for just under four weeks before being released on December 2 with grudging permission to retire from Duke Wilhelm Ernst's service.[^30][^31]

In August 1717, Bach had already signed his contract as Kapellmeister at the court of Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Köthen, a position he officially began after his release from detention.[^32] The Köthen period (1717-1723) proved one of Bach's most fruitful for instrumental composition, as the court's Calvinist worship required little sacred music, allowing Bach to focus on secular instrumental works including the Brandenburg Concertos, the first book of The Well-Tempered Clavier, and the solo violin and cello works.[^33] In 1722, following the death of his first wife Maria Barbara in 1720, Bach began seeking employment elsewhere, and in February 1723 was appointed cantor of St. Thomas's Church in Leipzig—though he was actually the committee's second choice after the more famous Telemann had declined.[^34][^35] On May 13, 1723, Bach was sworn in at Leipzig, beginning the final and longest chapter of his career that would last until his death 27 years later.[^36]

## Major Achievements

Johann Sebastian Bach's compositional output represents an unparalleled achievement in Western music, with over 1,000 surviving works spanning virtually every musical form and style of the Baroque era—secular, sacred, solo, ensemble, vocal, and instrumental.[^37][^38] His mastery across such diverse genres set him apart from his contemporaries and established a comprehensive musical legacy that continues to define classical music excellence.

Among Bach's most celebrated achievements are the Brandenburg Concertos (BWV 1046-1051), six concerti grossi composed circa 1711–20 and dedicated in 1721 to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt.[^39][^40] These works are widely regarded as some of the greatest orchestral compositions of the Baroque era, with Bach transcending existing concerto models by Vivaldi and other Italians through exploring innovative combinations of orchestral instruments.[^41][^42] Each concerto features unique instrumentation, with various points featuring solo roles for violin, three oboes, bassoon, two horns, and the perilously high trumpet solo in the second concerto.[^43] The Brandenburg Concertos were so groundbreaking that one movement from Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 was featured on the Voyager Golden Record sent into space in 1977.[^44]

Bach's keyboard works represent another pinnacle of his achievement. The Well-Tempered Clavier, consisting of two sets of 24 preludes and fugues in all major and minor keys, was composed with the first book dated 1722 "for the profit and use of musical youth desirous of learning, and especially for the pastime of those already skilled in this study," and a second book compiled some 20 years later.[^45][^46] Often called the "Old Testament" of keyboard literature (with Beethoven's piano sonatas as the "New Testament"), this work demonstrated Bach's mastery of all keys and has long been essential repertoire for keyboardists.[^47] The Goldberg Variations (BWV 988), first published in 1741, consists of an aria and thirty variations and is often regarded as the most serious and ambitious composition ever written for harpsichord.[^48][^49]

Bach's sacred music achievements are equally monumental. The St. Matthew Passion (BWV 244), first performed on Good Friday 1727, sets chapters 26-27 of the Gospel of Matthew to music for solo voices, double choir and double orchestra, and is widely regarded as one of the masterpieces of Baroque sacred music and the largest work in Bach's output.[^50][^51][^52] The Mass in B Minor (BWV 232), completed only one year before his death, showcases the prowess, ingenuity, and flexibility Bach had spent his lifetime honing, though he himself never heard the complete work performed.[^53] Beyond these masterworks, Bach composed approximately 200 sacred cantatas, numerous motets, and other liturgical works that formed the backbone of Lutheran worship in Leipzig.[^54]

Bach's instrumental masterpieces include the six Cello Suites and six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin (BWV 1001-1006), completed by 1720 in Köthen and placed at the pinnacle of their respective repertoires.[^55][^56] The 2nd Violin Partita is widely known for its monumental Chaconne, considered one of the most masterful and expressive works ever written for solo violin.[^57] His late works, particularly The Art of Fugue (BWV 1080) begun in 1742 and The Musical Offering (1747) composed for King Frederick the Great of Prussia, represent the culmination of Bach's lifelong fascination with learned counterpoint and fugal technique.[^58][^59][^60] These final masterworks, though incomplete at his death, demonstrate Bach's unparalleled contrapuntal mastery and continue to astound musicians and scholars centuries later.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his towering reputation today, Bach's career was marked by significant conflicts with employers and critics who questioned his methods and value. During his time at Weimar (1708-1717), Bach found himself caught in an intra-family feud at the court of Saxe-Weimar, where Prince Johann Ernst was locked in a power struggle with his ruthless and ambitious brother Wilhelm Ernst.[^61] The conflict escalated to the point where Wilhelm Ernst denied Bach access to music paper, effectively forbidding him to compose music.[^62] When Bach attempted to leave for a better position at Köthen, the Duke had him arrested on November 6, 1717, for "obstinately demanding his instant dismissal," imprisoning him for just under four weeks in what was likely a comfortable debtors' prison rather than a harsh cell before grudgingly releasing him on December 2.[^63][^64]

Bach's longest and most frustrating position was his 27-year tenure as Thomaskantor in Leipzig (1723-1750). The committee hiring Bach considered him "a mediocrity" and their last choice after more famous composers like Telemann had declined.[^65] As choirmaster at St. Thomas Church, Bach sacrificed half his salary to delegate his duty to teach Latin, managing to create magnificent church music that neither ecclesiastical nor civic authorities particularly wanted—this was his worst paid, most frustrating post.[^66] The City Council of Leipzig did not respect or appreciate Bach, and it is documented that Bach continually sought other employment opportunities until his "advanced years" prevented him from leaving Leipzig.[^67][^68]

Beyond employer conflicts, Bach faced professional criticism regarding his compositional style. Critics accused him of having a stuffy style and viewed him as a ponderous anachronism compared to the emerging galant style favored by his contemporaries.[^69] His St. Matthew Passion, premiering in 1727, was celebrated for its emotional depth yet criticized for being excessively theatrical for worship settings.[^70] Bach occasionally displayed a hot temper, particularly with those whom he considered to be musically incompetent, leading to interpersonal tensions.[^71]

The circumstances of Bach's death also merit scrutiny as a medical controversy. In the final year of his life, Bach's eyesight declined severely due to cataracts, and he agreed to undergo surgery performed by the traveling English eye surgeon John Taylor.[^72] Taylor, who performed two operations on Bach between March and April 1750, was later revealed to be a medical charlatan who by his own admission blinded hundreds of patients.[^73][^74] Both operations had disastrous results—Bach lost his sight completely, his eyes became painful, and he died less than four months after the second operation on July 28, 1750.[^75][^76] Taylor, who had also mistreated George Frideric Handel, trained at St. Thomas' Hospital in London but became notorious for self-promotion and medical malpractice, ironically dying completely blind himself in 1772.[^77][^78]

## Personal Life

Bach married twice and fathered twenty children over his lifetime, though only ten survived to adulthood.[^79] He married his first wife, Maria Barbara Bach, his second cousin, on October 17, 1707, four months after arriving in Mühlhausen.[^80][^81] Together they had seven children: Catharina Dorothea Bach (1708–1774); Wilhelm Friedemann (1710–1784); the twins Maria Sophia and Johann Christoph (both died in infancy); Carl Philipp Emanuel (1714–1788); and Johann Gottfried Bernhard (1715–1739).[^82] Maria Barbara died unexpectedly in July 1720 while Bach was traveling with Prince Leopold to Carlsbad—when he returned after two months, he found that his wife had suddenly died and been buried, a devastating shock.[^83]

The following year, Bach met Anna Magdalena Wilcke, a gifted soprano 16 years his junior, and they married on December 3, 1721.[^84] Anna Magdalena proved to be an invaluable partner, not only as a talented musician but also as a supportive companion who helped copy Bach's manuscripts. Together they had thirteen children, though only six survived into adulthood: Gottfried Heinrich (1724–1763); Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (1726–1781); Johann Christoph Friedrich (1732–1795); Johann Christian (1735–1782); Johanna Carolina (1737–1781); and Regina Susanna (1742–1809).[^85][^86] Notably, four of Bach's children became well-known composers in their own right: Wilhelm Friedemann and Carl Philipp Emanuel from his first marriage, and Johann Christoph Friedrich and Johann Christian from his second.[^87]

Bach's personality remains somewhat enigmatic, as surviving sources barely permit extensive interpretation of his private life—something likely intended by Bach himself, who was described as having an "oyster-like taciturnity."[^88] Mentions of his family and private sphere are rare in his personal letters, possibly due to a lack of elegance with writing, an absence of need to communicate, or simply because his heavy workload left little space for personal matters.[^89][^90] However, Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel recalled his sociable father who seldom wrote letters due to lack of free time but used every opportunity "to talk volubly to honest folk."[^91] The Bach household was well known for admirable hospitality, accommodating numerous visitors, and everyone found Bach very pleasant and exceedingly interesting to talk to, though he never touched on topics connected with his own life.[^92][^93]

Some of Bach's secular cantatas depicting social life, such as the Coffee Cantata (BWV 211) and Peasant Cantata (BWV 212) composed for entertainment at Zimmermann's Coffee House in Leipzig, hint at humorous and light-hearted character traits.[^94][^95] Several letters of recommendation testify to the great efforts Bach expended to advance the careers of his sons and pupils, revealing paternal solicitude and warm-hearted character.[^96] Yet conflicts with employers also reveal a man who could be stubborn and quick-tempered when he felt his musical standards or professional dignity were being compromised.[^97]

## Legacy

Johann Sebastian Bach's legacy as one of the greatest composers in Western music history is unassailable, yet this recognition came only after a century of near-obscurity following his death. For approximately one hundred years after he died in 1750, Bach's music was largely forgotten, having fallen out of fashion for being too labyrinthine and complex compared to the emerging Classical style.[^98] The "Bach Revival" began with Felix Mendelssohn's historic performance of the St. Matthew Passion on March 11, 1829, at the Singakademie in Berlin—the first time in a century that the beauty of this work was revealed to the German public.[^99][^100] Mendelssohn had received a score of the St. Matthew Passion from his grandmother as a birthday gift in 1824, and it was through his recognition of Bach's genius and efforts in making Bach's works accessible to a wider public that these works came to be recognized as summits of musical expression.[^101][^102]

Soon after Mendelssohn's 1829 performance, Bach started to become regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, if not the greatest, a reputation he has retained ever since.[^103] In 1850, the Bach-Gesellschaft was formed and entrusted with putting together a definitive edition of all Bach's works, a monumental task that took fifty years to complete.[^104] The most important biographical and critical work was Philipp Spitta's monumental study "Johann Sebastian Bach" (1873-80), which covered not only Bach's life and works but also historical background and, although wrong in many details, remains indispensable to Bach students.[^105] In 1802, Johann Nikolaus Forkel published the first Bach biography, and Ludwig van Beethoven, who learned The Well-Tempered Clavier in its entirety by age 11, called Bach the "progenitor of harmony."[^106][^107]

Bach's influence on subsequent composers is incalculable. Haydn owned manuscript copies of The Well-Tempered Clavier and the Mass in B Minor and was influenced by Bach's music.[^108] Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart owned a copy of one of Bach's motets, transcribed some of his instrumental works, and wrote contrapuntal music influenced by his style.[^109] During the Romantic era, Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms were deeply influenced by Bach's music, with Brahms frequently studying Bach's compositions and drawing inspiration for his own fugues and variations.[^110] The Neoclassical movement led by composers like Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith sought to revive the clarity and balance of earlier musical forms modeled on Bach.[^111] Several 20th-century composers referred to Bach or his music, including Eugène Ysaÿe in Six Sonatas for solo violin, Dmitri Shostakovich in 24 Preludes and Fugues, and Heitor Villa-Lobos in Bachianas Brasileiras.[^112]

Bach's legacy extends far beyond classical music into jazz, rock, and even electronic music. Jazz musicians including Jacques Loussier, Ian Anderson, Uri Caine, and the Modern Jazz Quartet have created jazz versions of his works.[^113] In 2011, the New York Times ranked Bach the number one composer.[^114] Dissemination of Bach scholarship continues through periodicals and websites devoted to him, publications such as the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, a numbered catalogue of his works), and new critical editions of his compositions.[^115] Bach's innovations in form, such as the development of the fugue and his exploration of new harmonic territories, laid the foundation for Western classical music and influenced generations of composers who followed.[^116]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Johann Sebastian Bach is now generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time and is celebrated as the creator of many masterpieces of church and instrumental music, representing the best of the Baroque era.[^117] Scholars conventionally use the death of Bach to mark the end of the Baroque era and consider him one of the greatest composers of all time.[^118] His mastery of counterpoint—the art of combining independent melodic lines—remains a pinnacle of Western music, with works like "The Art of Fugue" and "The Well-Tempered Clavier" exemplifying his skill in creating intricate, interwoven textures that are both intellectually stimulating and profoundly expressive.[^119]

Bach's genius in composition, intricate counterpoint, and harmonic innovation laid the foundation for modern classical music.[^120] His compositional style fundamentally relied on counterpoint and was characterized by a combination of technical rigor and expressive freedom, employing complex contrapuntal techniques such as canon, fugue, and double counterpoint to create intricate musical textures.[^121] The Routledge Research Companion to Johann Sebastian Bach provides an introduction to Bach research of the past thirty to fifty years, with essays designed for masters and doctoral students, demonstrating the continued scholarly engagement with his work.[^122]

Ludwig van Beethoven called Bach the "progenitor of harmony," recognizing his foundational contributions to Western music.[^123] Bach's work with the well-tempered tuning system allowed for a harmonious and universal approach to composition, effectively unlocking the keyboard's full potential across any key and removing the limitations of earlier tuning systems.[^124] The pedagogical importance of Bach's work cannot be overstated—his Inventions and Sinfonias were explicitly composed as teaching tools to develop the technical and musical abilities of students, and his teaching method involving thoroughbass, chorale, and fugue has influenced music education for centuries.[^125][^126] As a profoundly religious man, Bach considered music a means of communication with God and composed his cantatas to convey theological ideas through harmony and melody, inscribing "SDG" for "Soli Deo Gloria" (to God alone the glory) on his compositions.[^127][^128]

### Negative Views

Despite universal modern acclaim, critical perspectives on Bach have emerged questioning whether centuries of adulation have made objective evaluation impossible. Peter Williams, a notable Bach scholar, questions whether centuries of acclaim for Bach's music have made it impossible to evaluate the composer's work objectively.[^129] During his own lifetime and immediately after, Bach was viewed differently than today—critics accused him of having a stuffy style and viewed him as a ponderous anachronism compared to the emerging galant style.[^130]

Bach's contemporaries often ranked him below other composers of the era. When he was hired for the Leipzig Thomaskantor position in 1723, the committee considered him "a mediocrity" and their last choice after more famous composers like Georg Philipp Telemann had declined.[^131] Telemann, who composed about 3,000 works over his lifetime (more than Bach and Handel combined), stood with Handel as the embodiment of an international celebrity of the late Baroque, while Bach remained relatively provincial.[^132][^133] Bach was actually the second choice for the position at Leipzig, as the more famous Telemann had already declined.[^134]

The St. Matthew Passion, now considered a masterpiece, was criticized at its 1727 premiere for being excessively theatrical for worship settings.[^135] Some critics found Bach's music too complex and labyrinthine—after his death, his music fell out of fashion for precisely this reason, remaining forgotten for nearly a century until Mendelssohn's revival.[^136] The fact that Bach continually sought other employment opportunities throughout his Leipzig tenure and that the City Council did not respect or appreciate him suggests that his employer found his work less valuable than modern assessment would indicate.[^137]

Furthermore, Bach's career was marked by frequent conflicts with authorities, getting arrested in Weimar for "obstinately demanding his instant dismissal" and facing criticism from employers for temperamental behavior and perceived musical incompetence of others.[^138][^139] Some view these conflicts as evidence of difficult personality traits rather than solely principled stands for artistic integrity. Additionally, the circumstances of his medical treatment—falling victim to the charlatan surgeon John Taylor—raise questions about Bach's judgment in his final years.[^140]
