## Summary

Cheng Yi was a Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher who, with his brother Cheng Hao, founded the School of Principle. He emphasized the investigation of things (gewu) as the method for understanding principle (li). His more rationalistic approach was developed by Zhu Xi into the dominant form of Neo-Confucianism. He is known for his rigorous moral philosophy and his insistence on the unity of knowledge and seriousness (jing).
