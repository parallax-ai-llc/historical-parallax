## Summary

On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped atomic bomb "Little Boy" on Hiroshima, Japan, instantly killing 70,000+ people and destroying the city. Three days later, "Fat Man" destroyed Nagasaki, killing 40,000+. These were the first and only uses of nuclear weapons in warfare. Radiation sickness, burns, and cancer killed tens of thousands more in subsequent months and years. Japan surrendered August 15, ending WWII. The bombings remain intensely controversial: supporters argue they ended war quickly, saving lives that would have been lost in invasion; critics condemn killing civilians and question military necessity. The atomic age began, fundamentally changing warfare, geopolitics, and humanity's relationship with technology.

## Background

**Manhattan Project**:
- Secret U.S. program to develop atomic bomb
- Cost $2 billion, employed 130,000 people
- Scientists: Oppenheimer, Fermi, Bohr, Einstein (indirectly)
- First test: Trinity (July 16, 1945, New Mexico)

**Japan's Situation**:
- Facing defeat but refusing surrender
- U.S. firebombing had devastated cities (Tokyo: 100,000 killed March 1945)
- Soviet Union preparing to invade
- Japanese military vowed fight to death

**Truman's Decision**:
- Became president April 1945 (Roosevelt's death)
- Presented with Options:
  1. **Invasion** (Operation Downfall): U.S. estimated 250,000+ American casualties, millions of Japanese
  2. **Continue conventional bombing and blockade**: Prolonged war
  3. **Atomic bomb**: Quick end, demonstration of power

Truman chose bomb.

## Nagasaki (August 9, 1945)

**Why Second Bomb?**:
- Japan did not surrender immediately
- Soviet Union declared war on Japan (August 8)
- U.S. wanted to demonstrate it had multiple bombs

**The Mission**:
- B-29 *Bockscar* (pilot: Maj. Charles Sweeney)
- "Fat Man" (plutonium bomb, 21 kilotons)
- Original target: Kokura (obscured by clouds)
- Secondary target: Nagasaki
- 11:02 AM: Detonation

**Destruction**:
- Hilly terrain limited blast
- **Immediate deaths**: 40,000
- **Total by year's end**: 70,000

## Controversy

**Justifications**:
- Ended war quickly
- Prevented invasion casualties (could have been millions)
- Japan was warned (leaflets dropped, though vague)
- Japan committed atrocities throughout war
- Saved Japanese civilians from prolonged bombing/starvation

**Criticisms**:
- Targeted civilians deliberately
- Japan was already defeated, would have surrendered soon
- Soviet entry into war was decisive factor, not bombs
- Could have demonstrated bomb on unpopulated area
- War crime/crime against humanity
- Started nuclear arms race

**Truman's View**:
Never expressed public regret, believed decision correct.

**Historians' Debate**:
- Most support military necessity argument
- Growing minority questions it
- Consensus: Decision was complex, influenced by multiple factors including desire to impress/intimidate Soviet Union

## Legacy

**Radiation Deaths**:
- Continued for decades
- Cancer, leukemia rates soared
- Children born to survivors had health issues

**Nuclear Taboo**:
- No nuclear weapons used in war since 1945
- Established norm against use

**Arms Race**:
- Soviet Union tested bomb (1949)
- U.K., France, China, Israel, India, Pakistan, North Korea followed
- Thousands of nuclear weapons stockpiled

**Hiroshima/Nagasaki Today**:
- Rebuilt, thriving cities
- Peace memorials, museums
- Atomic bomb domes preserved (UNESCO sites)
- Annual ceremonies
- Hibakusha tell their stories (aging population)

**Moral Questions**:
- When, if ever, is using weapons of mass destruction justified?
- Responsibility of scientists for their inventions
- Deterrence vs. disarmament
