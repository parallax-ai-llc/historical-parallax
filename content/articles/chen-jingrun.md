Chen Jingrun was a Chinese mathematician who made significant progress on the Goldbach conjecture. His Chen's theorem (1966) proved that every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of a prime and a product of at most two primes. This was the closest anyone had come to proving the Goldbach conjecture. He became a national hero in China for his mathematical achievements.
