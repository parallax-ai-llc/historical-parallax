## Summary
Pedro Alonso López, known as the "Monster of the Andes," is a Colombian serial killer who confessed to the rape and murder of over 300 girls across South America. He was convicted of 110 murders in Ecuador and is considered one of the most prolific serial killers in history. After serving 14 years in an Ecuadorian prison, he was released in 1998 and his current whereabouts are unknown.

## Early Life
Pedro López was born on October 8, 1948, in Santa Isabel, Tolima, Colombia, the seventh of thirteen children. His mother was a sex worker who caught him fondling his younger sister when he was eight and expelled him from the home. He survived on the streets of Bogotá, where he was taken in by a man who repeatedly sexually abused him. He was later placed in a school for orphans where he was also sexually assaulted. These early traumatic experiences were cited as contributing factors to his later crimes. [^1]

## Criminal Career
López began killing in the early 1970s, targeting young indigenous and mestiza girls aged 8 to 12 across Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. He would lure victims from marketplaces and tribal areas with offers of gifts or money. He claimed to have killed approximately 100 girls in each of the three countries. His crimes were facilitated by the poverty and political instability in the Andean regions, where missing children from poor families often went unreported. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
López was first captured by indigenous Ayacucho people in Peru in 1978 after attempting to kidnap a young girl. He was nearly executed but a missionary intervened, and he was deported to Ecuador. He was arrested in Ambato, Ecuador, in 1980 after a flash flood uncovered the remains of several victims. He led police to the graves of 53 victims and confessed to over 300 murders. He was sentenced to 16 years, the maximum in Ecuador. He was released in 1998, briefly institutionalized in Colombia, then released again in 2002. His whereabouts have been unknown since. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His case eventually led to improved child protection measures in Andean countries [^4]
- Prompted greater international cooperation on cross-border serial crimes in South America
- Drew attention to the vulnerability of children in impoverished regions

## Negative Perspectives
- Confessed to the rape and murder of over 300 girls across three countries [^5]
- Specifically targeted impoverished indigenous children who were unlikely to be reported missing
- Received a relatively short sentence and was released, raising serious public safety concerns
- Current whereabouts unknown since 2002, potentially still a danger
- His crimes exposed the failure of South American justice systems to protect vulnerable children
