## Summary
Miyuki Ishikawa was a Japanese midwife who murdered an estimated 85 to 169 infants in Tokyo during the late 1940s. She deliberately neglected newborn babies of parents who could not afford to raise them, allowing them to die. She was convicted in 1948 but received a remarkably lenient sentence.

## Early Life
Born around 1897, Ishikawa became a midwife and director of a maternity hospital in the Waseda district of Tokyo. She was educated and respected in her profession. [^1]

## Criminal Career
During the post-World War II period of extreme poverty in Japan, Ishikawa ran a maternity hospital where impoverished parents brought unwanted infants. Rather than caring for them, she deliberately neglected the babies, allowing them to die from malnutrition and dehydration. She collected fees from parents and disposed of the bodies. An estimated 85 to 169 infants died. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Two police officers discovered suspicious infant remains in 1948, leading to an investigation. Ishikawa was arrested along with her husband and a doctor who had provided false death certificates. Despite the massive number of victims, she was sentenced to only eight years in prison, later reduced to four on appeal. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Her case influenced discussions leading to the legalization of abortion in Japan through the Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 [^4]
- Highlighted the desperate conditions facing Japanese families after World War II
- Prompted improvements in infant welfare services

## Negative Perspectives
- Responsible for the deaths of possibly 169 infants [^5]
- Exploited desperate parents' trust
- Collected fees while letting infants die
- Received an extraordinarily lenient sentence
- Victims were the most helpless members of society
