## Summary

Milutin Milankovitch was a Serbian mathematician, astronomer, and geophysicist who developed the mathematical theory of climate change based on variations in Earth's orbital parameters. The Milankovitch cycles explain how changes in Earth's eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession affect climate and ice ages over tens of thousands of years. His theory was confirmed by deep-sea sediment analysis in the 1970s.
