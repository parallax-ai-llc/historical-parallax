## Summary

The Manises UFO incident is unique in aviation history: it forced a commercial airliner (**TAE Flight 297**) carrying 109 passengers to make an emergency landing to escape a UFO. On November 11, 1979, the Caravelle jet was chased by red lights over the Mediterranean.

After the emergency landing in Valencia, the Spanish Air Force scrambled a Mirage F1 fighter jet. The pilot, Captain **Fernando Cámara**, chased the object for hours, experiencing radar jamming and missile lock warnings from the UFO itself. It is the most significant UFO case in Spanish history.[^1]

## The Commercial Encounter

### Flight JK-297
En route from Mallorca to the Canary Islands, the pilot **Javier Lerdo de Tejada** noticed two intense red lights approaching the plane on a collision course.
*   **The Pursuit:** The lights violated safety distance rules. The pilot requested altitude changes, but the lights mirrored his moves.
*   **Emergency Landing:** Fearing a collision, the Captain requested an emergency landing at Manises Airport (Valencia). This was the **first time in history** a commercial flight was forced down by a UFO.

## The Military Intercept

### Mirage F1 Scramble
Captain Fernando Cámara took off from Albacete to intercept.
*   **Visual:** He saw a truncated cone shape changing colors.
*   **Electronic Warfare:** When Cámara tried to lock his missiles, his RWR (Radar Warning Receiver) went off, indicating **he** was being locked onto by a continuous wave radar (like a missile battery).
*   **The Chase:** The object accelerated to Mach 3 and led him on a chase across Spain before vanishing.[^2]

## Aftermath

*   **Parliamentary Question:** The incident was so serious it was debated in the Spanish Parliament in 1980.
*   **Explanation:** The official report weaky suggested "stars" or "chemical plant reflections," which the pilots vehemently rejected.
