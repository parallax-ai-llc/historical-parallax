## Summary

Alexander Andries Maramis (1897-1977), commonly known as A.A. Maramis, was an Indonesian nationalist, politician, diplomat, and National Hero who played crucial roles in Indonesia's independence struggle and early government formation. As a member of the Committee of Nine that drafted the Jakarta Charter and Indonesia's constitution, he advocated for religious pluralism and secular governance to protect Christian minorities. He served as Indonesia's de facto first Minister of Finance, orchestrating the creation of the Oeang Republik Indonesia (ORI), the nation's first independent currency. Throughout his distinguished career, Maramis represented Indonesia as ambassador to the Philippines, West Germany, and the Soviet Union, and was posthumously honored as a National Hero in 2019 for his foundational contributions to the Indonesian state.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Alexander Andries Maramis was born on June 20, 1897, in Manado, North Sulawesi, to Andries Alexander Maramis and Charlotte Ticoalu.[^3] He was the second child in a family of nine siblings from the prominent Maramis-Ticoalu family in Minahasa, a predominantly Christian region in the northern part of Sulawesi.[^4] His family background placed him within the educated Christian elite of the Dutch East Indies, a community that would play significant roles in the nationalist movement.

Maramis's early education followed the colonial pattern designed for native elites. He attended the Europeesche Lagere School (ELS), the Dutch-language elementary school in Manado, which provided him with fluency in Dutch and access to Western education.[^5] He later transferred to the Hogere Burgerschool (HBS), the Dutch secondary school in Batavia (now Jakarta), where he met two individuals who would become lifelong friends and fellow independence activists: Arnold Mononutu, also from Minahasa, and Achmad Subardjo.[^6] This friendship network would prove instrumental in the nationalist movement, as all three would go on to serve in diplomatic and ministerial positions in the Indonesian government.

The Maramis family had a strong tradition of public service and advocacy for social progress. His aunt, Maria Walanda Maramis, became an Indonesian National Hero for her pioneering work advancing women's rights and education in Indonesia during the early 20th century.[^7] This familial connection to social reform undoubtedly influenced young Alexander's worldview and commitment to improving Indonesian society. When his mother died in 1919, his father remarried Julia Mogot, and the family continued to maintain its prominent position in Minahasa society.[^8]

In 1919, at the age of 22, Maramis left the Dutch East Indies for the Netherlands to pursue higher education at Leiden University, one of Europe's most prestigious institutions.[^9] His decision to study law reflected both the practical opportunities available to colonial subjects and the intellectual ferment that would shape his political consciousness. At Leiden, he would encounter not just legal training but also the radical nationalist ideas that were transforming Indonesian students' understanding of colonialism and independence.

## Rise to Power

Maramis's political awakening occurred during his years at Leiden University, where he became deeply involved with Perhimpoenan Indonesia (Indonesian Association), the most important organization of Indonesian nationalist students in Europe.[^10] This association, originally founded in 1908 as Indische Vereeniging (Indies Association) as a social club, had undergone a radical transformation after World War I. By the time Maramis joined, it had evolved into an explicitly anti-colonial, nationalist organization with a strong anti-capitalist outlook, clearly articulated in its journal *Indonesia Merdeka* ("Independent Indonesia").[^11]

In 1924, Maramis was elected secretary of Perhimpoenan Indonesia, a position that placed him at the heart of the Indonesian nationalist movement in Europe.[^12] The organization's leadership during this period included other future Indonesian leaders such as Mohammad Hatta, who would become Indonesia's first vice president. The Perhimpoenan Indonesia actively sought alliances with anti-colonial and anti-imperialist movements across Europe, from Brussels to Paris to Berlin, building international networks that would later prove valuable for Indonesia's diplomatic recognition.[^13] Maramis and his colleagues worked to expose Dutch colonial abuses and advocate for Indonesian self-determination in international forums.

After graduating with his law degree in 1924, Maramis returned to Indonesia in July of that year.[^14] He faced an immediate choice that would define his political stance: the Dutch East Indies government offered him employment, likely a lucrative position befitting his education. However, consistent with his nationalist convictions, Maramis refused this offer, choosing instead to work as a lawyer serving less fortunate Indonesians.[^15] He began his legal career at the district court in Semarang in 1925, later moving to the district court in Palembang in 1926.[^16] This decision to work outside the colonial administrative structure, while sacrificing potential wealth and status, demonstrated his commitment to Indonesian interests over personal advancement.

As World War II drew to a close and Japanese occupation forces sought to prepare for an orderly transition, they established the Badan Penyelidik Usaha-Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan Indonesia (BPUPKI), or Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence, on March 1, 1945.[^17] Maramis was appointed to this crucial 62-member body tasked with laying the groundwork for Indonesian independence. His inclusion reflected both his legal expertise and his standing as a respected nationalist figure who could represent Christian minority perspectives in discussions about the future Indonesian state.

During the BPUPKI's first session from May 28 to June 1, 1945, foundational debates occurred about Indonesia's state ideology. Following these discussions, Sukarno formed a smaller Committee of Nine (Panitia Sembilan) to refine the constitutional framework. Maramis was selected as one of the nine members, alongside Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Mohammad Yamin, Achmad Subardjo, Wahid Hasyim, Abdul Kahar Muzakkir, Agus Salim, and Abikusno Tjokrosoejoso.[^18] Significantly, Maramis was the only Christian on this committee, representing secular nationalist interests in deliberations that would determine the religious character of the Indonesian state.[^19]

## Major Achievements

### The Jakarta Charter and Constitutional Framework

On June 22, 1945, the Committee of Nine convened to formulate a preamble for Indonesia's constitution, producing what became known as the Jakarta Charter (Piagam Jakarta).[^20] This document incorporated Sukarno's Pancasila philosophy—five principles including belief in God, humanitarianism, national unity, democracy, and social justice—but originally included seven controversial words in Indonesian (*dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluknya*) that placed an obligation on Muslims to abide by Islamic law.[^21]

Maramis's most significant constitutional contribution came in the dramatic revision of this provision. The inclusion of Islamic law obligations threatened to alienate non-Muslim populations, particularly in Christian-majority regions like Maramis's native Minahasa, as well as Batak and Ambonese Christians. There was genuine concern that discriminatory provisions could drive these important minorities into supporting the returning Dutch colonial forces.[^22] On August 18, 1945, one day after Sukarno's declaration of independence, Mohammad Hatta moved to remove the "seven words" based explicitly on a request from Christian representative Alexander Andries Maramis, after consultation with moderate Islamic representatives including Teuku Mohammad Hassan, Kasman Singodimedjo, and Ki Bagus Hadikusumo.[^23] This deletion ensured that Indonesia would be founded as a pluralistic state rather than an Islamic theocracy, a decision of immense consequence for the nation's trajectory.

### Ministry of Finance and Creation of National Currency

On September 2, 1945, shortly after independence, Samsi Sastrawidagda was appointed as Indonesia's first Minister of Finance in the Presidential Cabinet.[^24] However, due to chronic illness, Sastrawidagda resigned after only two weeks. On September 26, 1945, Maramis was appointed to replace him, becoming the de facto first Minister of Finance given his predecessor's extremely brief tenure.[^25] He would serve in this capacity through November 14, 1945, and again from 1948 to 1949, making him one of the most consequential finance ministers in Indonesian history.[^26]

Maramis's most enduring achievement as Finance Minister was orchestrating the creation of Indonesia's first independent currency, the Oeang Republik Indonesia (ORI). On September 29, 1945, just three days after his appointment, Maramis issued a decree with three critical decisions regarding monetary policy.[^27] On November 7, 1945, he formed the "Committee for the Administration of Printing Paper Money of the Republic of Indonesia," chaired by T.R.B. Sabaroedin from the Central Office of Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI).[^28]

The creation of ORI was fraught with practical and political challenges. Printing began in January 1946, operating daily from 7 AM to 10 PM.[^29] However, deteriorating security conditions as Dutch forces attempted to reassert control forced the relocation of printing operations from Jakarta to multiple locations including Yogyakarta, Surakarta, Malang, and Ponorogo in May 1946.[^30] Despite these obstacles, ORI was formally issued on October 30, 1946, replacing Japanese occupation currency and Netherlands Indies Civil Administration (NICA) notes.[^31]

The symbolic importance of ORI cannot be overstated—it represented economic sovereignty and Indonesian self-determination in tangible form that every citizen could hold. Maramis's signature appeared on the first ORI notes despite the fact that he was no longer serving as Finance Minister when they were issued.[^32] In recognition of this contribution, the Indonesian World Records Museum recognized Maramis as the Minister of Finance whose signature appeared on the most Indonesian banknotes, with his autograph on 15 different denominations issued between 1945 and 1947.[^33]

### Diplomatic Career

Following Indonesia's successful struggle for independence and international recognition, Maramis transitioned to diplomatic service, representing the new nation abroad. From 1950 to 1953, he served as Indonesian Ambassador to the Philippines, helping to establish diplomatic relations with a fellow Southeast Asian nation that had recently gained its own independence.[^34] This was followed by his appointment as Ambassador to West Germany from 1953 to 1956, a strategically important position during the Cold War as Indonesia pursued its non-aligned foreign policy.[^35]

From 1956 to 1959, Maramis served as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, with concurrent accreditation to Finland.[^36] These ambassadorial appointments demonstrated both Maramis's diplomatic skills and Indonesia's confidence in him to represent the nation in diverse international contexts—from the Catholic Philippines to the divided Germanies to the communist Soviet Union. His service in these posts spanned nearly a decade, during which he helped establish Indonesia's presence on the global stage and build relationships that would support the young nation's development and security.

### Recognition and Legacy Institutions

The Indonesian government has honored Maramis's contributions through several lasting tributes. Most prominently, the headquarters of the Indonesian Ministry of Finance is named the A.A. Maramis Building.[^37] This historic structure, originally constructed between 1809 and 1828 as the palace of Dutch Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels, was renamed in 2008 to honor the former Finance Minister.[^38] The building underwent comprehensive restoration from November 2019 to December 2022, and now serves as a museum, library, state reception venue, and educational facility for the Ministry of Finance.[^39]

On November 8, 2019, President Joko Widodo posthumously conferred upon Alexander Andries Maramis the honorary title of National Hero of Indonesia.[^40] He was one of six individuals honored that year, and notably one of three BPUPKI members to receive the designation, alongside Abdul Kahar Muzakkir and Professor M. Sardjito.[^41] The recognition came 42 years after his death, acknowledging his foundational contributions to Indonesian statehood, constitutional framework, and economic infrastructure.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many figures from Indonesia's revolutionary period, A.A. Maramis's historical record contains remarkably few documented controversies or significant criticisms.[^42] This relative absence of scandal may reflect several factors: his diplomatic temperament, his role as a mediating figure between different constituencies, his relatively brief tenure in executive positions, and the fact that he spent significant portions of his career abroad in ambassadorial roles rather than in the turbulent domestic political arena.

Some potential areas of criticism, though not extensively documented in available sources, merit consideration. Maramis's advocacy for removing Islamic law provisions from the constitution, while ultimately contributing to Indonesia's pluralistic character, may have generated resentment among more conservative Islamic constituencies who viewed this as a betrayal of Muslim interests. However, historical accounts emphasize that Mohammad Hatta carefully consulted with moderate Islamic leaders before making the change, suggesting that the modification had broader support than critics might claim.[^43]

Maramis's long diplomatic career, particularly his extended residence abroad, meant that he was somewhat removed from the daily struggles of ordinary Indonesians during the difficult early independence period. While serving as ambassador in comfortable European capitals, Indonesian citizens endured economic hardships, regional rebellions, and political instability. Some critics might argue that elite figures like Maramis enjoyed privileges disconnected from common people's experiences, though such criticism is more properly directed at the broader structure of post-colonial governance than at Maramis specifically.

His decision to settle in Switzerland after completing his ambassadorial service and remaining there for nearly two decades (from approximately 1959 to 1976) raises questions about his commitment to living in the nation he helped create.[^44] While many diaspora figures maintain connections to their homelands, the choice to reside in comfortable exile in Switzerland rather than returning earlier to contribute to national development could be viewed as a form of abandonment, particularly during the tumultuous transition from Sukarno's Guided Democracy to Suharto's New Order regime.

Additionally, as a member of the educated elite who navigated between Indonesian nationalism and Dutch colonial education systems, Maramis might be critiqued from more radical perspectives as representing a compromised, bourgeois form of nationalism that ultimately replicated colonial class structures rather than fundamentally transforming them. His refusal of Dutch colonial employment and choice to work as a people's lawyer partially addresses such criticism, but the broader question of whether Indonesia's independence truly benefited the masses or merely transferred power from Dutch to Indonesian elites remains a contested historiographical issue.

The scarcity of documented controversies might itself suggest incomplete historical accounting. As with many national heroes, there may be a tendency toward hagiography that overlooks complexities, contradictions, or problematic aspects of Maramis's career. Future scholarship with access to private papers, diplomatic correspondence, and oral histories from contemporaries might reveal more nuanced portraits of his decision-making, relationships, and impact.

---

## Personal Life

Information about Alexander Andries Maramis's personal life—including details about marriage, children, personal interests, and daily habits—is surprisingly limited in available historical sources.[^45] This scarcity reflects both the tendency of historical documentation to focus on public achievements rather than private experiences and the fact that Maramis himself may have been a reserved individual who maintained clear boundaries between his public service and personal life.

What is documented about his personal character suggests a man of principle and conviction. His refusal of Dutch colonial employment in favor of representing less fortunate Indonesians as a lawyer demonstrates commitment to his ideals even when personal financial interest suggested otherwise.[^46] His longtime friendships with Arnold Mononutu and Achmad Subardjo, forged during their school days and maintained throughout their parallel careers in Indonesian diplomacy and politics, suggest loyalty and the importance of personal relationships in his life.[^47]

Maramis's educational background shaped his intellectual orientation. His fluency in Dutch, acquired through ELS and HBS schooling, combined with his legal training at Leiden University, placed him within an elite stratum of Indonesians who could navigate both Indonesian and European cultural contexts.[^48] This bicultural competence served him well in diplomatic roles but may also have created some distance from Indonesians without similar colonial educational advantages.

His Christian faith, while not extensively documented in terms of personal religious practice, was clearly significant to his public identity. As the only Christian on the Committee of Nine, he represented not just his own beliefs but an entire constituency of Indonesian Christians who feared marginalization in a Muslim-majority nation.[^49] His successful advocacy for removing Islamic law provisions from the constitution reflected both political pragmatism and presumably personal conviction about the importance of religious pluralism.

After completing his ambassadorial service to the Soviet Union and Finland around 1959, Maramis and his family settled in Switzerland, where they remained for nearly two decades.[^50] The choice of Switzerland—neutral, prosperous, and hosting numerous international organizations—suggests someone who valued stability and perhaps desired distance from Indonesia's increasingly turbulent domestic politics under both Sukarno's late Guided Democracy period and Suharto's early New Order regime.

On June 27, 1976, Maramis returned to Jakarta after almost 20 years abroad.[^51] Among those greeting him at the airport were his old friends Achmad Subardjo and Arnold Mononutu, along with Rachmi Hatta, the wife of Mohammad Hatta.[^52] This reception by lifelong associates suggests that despite his long absence, Maramis had maintained connections with key figures from his revolutionary generation. His return to Indonesia, at age 79, might have been motivated by desire to spend his final years in his homeland, declining health, or both.

Tragically, Maramis's homecoming was brief. In May 1977, just eleven months after returning, he suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and was hospitalized.[^53] He died on July 31, 1977, at Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, thirteen months after his return to Indonesia.[^54] He was 80 years old. His body lay in state in the Pancasila room at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before burial at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery, the final resting place for Indonesian heroes and patriots.[^55]

## Legacy

Alexander Andries Maramis's legacy encompasses multiple dimensions of Indonesian national development: constitutional architecture, economic sovereignty, diplomatic representation, and minority rights protection. His contributions have endured through institutional commemorations, scholarly recognition, and the ongoing relevance of the principles he championed during the foundational period of Indonesian statehood.

### Constitutional and Philosophical Legacy

Maramis's single most significant legacy is his role in shaping Indonesia's constitutional identity as a pluralistic rather than Islamic state. By requesting the removal of the seven words requiring Muslims to follow Islamic law from the Jakarta Charter, he helped establish the principle that Indonesia would be a nation respectful of religion without being governed by any single religious law.[^56] This decision enabled Indonesia to develop as a diverse nation where Pancasila serves as a unifying ideology transcending religious differences.

The ramifications of this constitutional choice continue to resonate in contemporary Indonesian politics. Debates about the role of Islam in governance, the rights of religious minorities, and the proper relationship between religion and state remain contentious issues. When these debates occur, they take place within a constitutional framework that Maramis helped establish—one that explicitly rejects theocratic governance while affirming the importance of belief in God as the first principle of Pancasila.[^57]

### Economic and Institutional Legacy

As the de facto first Minister of Finance and the architect of ORI, Maramis laid foundations for Indonesian economic sovereignty.[^58] The creation of national currency was not merely a technical monetary matter but a powerful assertion of statehood and self-determination. ORI demonstrated to Indonesians and the international community that the Republic possessed the capacity to manage its own economic affairs independent of Dutch colonial structures.

The Ministry of Finance building bearing Maramis's name serves as a daily reminder to Indonesian financial officials of the institution's origins and the principles of its founder.[^59] This physical commemoration ensures that successive generations of finance ministry employees encounter Maramis's legacy as part of their professional identity. The building's restoration and conversion into a museum and educational facility further amplifies this commemorative function, making Maramis's story accessible to broader publics.[^60]

### Diplomatic Legacy

Maramis's decade of service as ambassador to the Philippines, West Germany, the Soviet Union, and Finland during the critical 1950s helped establish Indonesia's international presence and credibility.[^61] These early diplomatic relationships laid groundwork for Indonesia's subsequent role as a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, a founding member of ASEAN, and an increasingly influential voice in global affairs. While Maramis was one among many Indonesian diplomats, his service during these formative years contributed to patterns of international engagement that shaped Indonesian foreign policy for decades.

### Representation of Minority Interests

For Christian Indonesians, particularly those from Minahasa and other eastern Indonesian regions, Maramis serves as an important symbolic figure representing their inclusion in the national narrative. His presence on the Committee of Nine and his advocacy for constitutional provisions protecting religious pluralism demonstrated that minorities could influence national decision-making and that Indonesian identity transcended the Muslim majority.[^62] This representation remains significant in contemporary Indonesia, where religious and ethnic minorities sometimes feel marginalized by nationalist discourses that emphasize Javanese Muslim identity as normative.

### Recognition and Honors

The 2019 conferral of National Hero status by President Jokowi represented formal state recognition of Maramis's contributions more than four decades after his death.[^63] This delayed recognition might reflect the complex politics of national hero designations, which often balance regional representation, religious diversity, and political considerations. The simultaneous honoring of three BPUPKI members who had not previously received National Hero status suggests a conscious effort to recognize the broader range of individuals who contributed to independence beyond the most famous revolutionary leaders.[^64]

### Scholarly Assessment

Academic evaluations of Maramis tend to emphasize his role as a moderating, pragmatic figure who helped bridge different constituencies during the critical independence period. Scholarly articles such as "KONTRIBUSI MR. ALEXANDER ANDRIES MARAMIS BAGI NEGARA KESATUAN REPUBLIK INDONESIA" (The Contributions of Mr. Alexander Andries Maramis to the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia) published in academic journals have examined his multifaceted contributions to Indonesian statehood.[^65] However, compared to figures like Sukarno, Hatta, or Sjahrir, Maramis remains relatively understudied, suggesting opportunities for future historical scholarship to provide more comprehensive assessments of his life and impact.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Contemporary and historical assessments of Alexander Andries Maramis predominantly emphasize his constructive contributions to Indonesian independence and state-building. Scholars of Indonesian constitutional history credit him with playing a crucial mediating role during the intense debates about the religious character of the Indonesian state. His position as the sole Christian representative on the Committee of Nine provided essential minority perspective that prevented Indonesia from adopting provisions that might have alienated significant portions of the population and potentially undermined national unity.[^66]

Indonesian nationalist historiography generally portrays Maramis as part of the generation of educated nationalist elites who combined Western education with commitment to Indonesian self-determination. His involvement in Perhimpoenan Indonesia during the 1920s places him within the intellectual vanguard of the independence movement, alongside figures like Mohammad Hatta and Sutan Sjahrir who developed sophisticated anti-colonial ideologies influenced by European socialist and anti-imperialist thought.[^67] From this perspective, Maramis represents successful translation of cosmopolitan educational experiences into service of national liberation.

Economic historians and financial professionals in Indonesia recognize Maramis as a founding figure of Indonesian monetary sovereignty. The creation of ORI under extremely challenging circumstances—during ongoing revolutionary struggle, with limited resources and infrastructure—represented remarkable organizational achievement and political vision.[^68] That his signature appeared on 15 different banknotes, more than any other Finance Minister, symbolizes the foundational nature of his economic contributions.[^69] The naming of the Ministry of Finance headquarters after him reflects institutional gratitude for his pioneering work.

Diplomatic historians note Maramis's contributions to establishing Indonesia's international presence during the crucial first decade of independence. His service in diverse postings—the Catholic Philippines, divided Germany, and the communist Soviet Union—demonstrated both his personal diplomatic capabilities and Indonesia's commitment to non-aligned foreign policy that engaged constructively with nations across ideological divides.[^70] These early ambassadorial relationships helped Indonesia avoid becoming subordinated to either Cold War bloc and maintained space for independent foreign policy formation.

Regional historians from North Sulawesi and Minahasa claim Maramis as an important representative who demonstrated that Indonesians from eastern regions could contribute at the highest levels of national leadership. In regions that sometimes feel dominated by Javanese political and cultural hegemony, Maramis serves as a powerful counter-example of provincial influence on national development.[^71] His aunt Maria Walanda Maramis's parallel recognition as a National Hero for women's rights advocacy creates a family narrative of public service and social progress that remains inspirational.

Christian Indonesian communities particularly value Maramis's legacy for his advocacy of religious pluralism and protection of minority rights. Religious freedom advocates point to his intervention in the Jakarta Charter debates as a critical moment that determined Indonesia's subsequent trajectory toward constitutional pluralism rather than religious state formation.[^72] Without his advocacy, supported by moderate Muslims like Mohammad Hatta, Indonesia might have developed very differently, potentially with greater religious discrimination and conflict.

### Negative Views

Critical perspectives on Maramis, while less prominently documented in available sources, can be inferred from broader critiques of Indonesian independence-era elites. Radical historians and activists sometimes characterize figures like Maramis as representing bourgeois nationalism that ultimately failed to transform colonial social and economic structures. From this viewpoint, the independence struggle led by educated elites merely transferred power from Dutch colonizers to Indonesian ruling classes without fundamentally improving conditions for peasants, workers, and the urban poor.[^73]

Some Islamic scholars and activists have criticized the removal of the seven words from the Jakarta Charter as a betrayal of Muslim aspirations for an Islamic state. While Maramis's role is usually understood as advocating for Christian minority interests, more critical Islamic perspectives might characterize his intervention as undermining the democratic will of the Muslim majority and preventing Indonesia from fulfilling its potential as an Islamic nation.[^74] These views, while not mainstream in contemporary Indonesia, persist in certain conservative religious circles.

Nationalist critics might question Maramis's extended residence in Switzerland from approximately 1959 to 1976, viewing this as a form of elite abandonment of Indonesia during difficult developmental periods. While diplomatic service abroad is generally viewed positively, choosing to remain in comfortable European exile for nearly two decades after completing ambassadorial duties might be interpreted as lack of commitment to living with the consequences of independence or unwillingness to contribute to nation-building during challenging times.[^75]

Regional and ethnic critics from outside Minahasa and Christian communities might view the attention given to Maramis as disproportionate to his actual historical importance, seeing his commemoration as reflecting elite biases toward Western-educated, Christian minorities rather than genuinely assessing revolutionary contributions. From these perspectives, many equally or more important figures from other regions and backgrounds remain unrecognized while Maramis received the National Hero designation largely due to his elite status and minority representation considerations.[^76]

Historiographical critics note that, like many national heroes, Maramis has been subject to hagiographic treatment that obscures complexities, failures, and problematic aspects of his career. The relative absence of documented controversies or criticisms in available sources might reflect incomplete historical investigation rather than genuinely unblemished character. More critical scholarship might reveal compromises, strategic errors, or interpersonal conflicts that present a less flattering portrait.[^77]
