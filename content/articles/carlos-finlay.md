## Summary

Carlos Finlay was a Cuban physician who first proposed the theory that yellow fever was transmitted by mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti. His hypothesis, presented in 1881, was initially dismissed but later confirmed by Walter Reed's commission. His work was fundamental to tropical medicine and vector-borne disease control.
