## Summary

Gwanghaegun (born June 4, 1575; died August 7, 1641) was the 15th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1608 to 1623.[^1] His reign is one of the most controversial in Korean history. Historically vilified as a tyrant who was deposed in the **Injo Restoration** (Injo Banjeong), modern historians often re-evaluate him as a pragmatic diplomat and reformer. He is best known for his **Neutral Diplomacy** (Jungnip Oegyo) between the Ming and Qing dynasties to prevent war, and for implementing the **Daedong Law**, a revolutionary tax reform. However, his harsh purging of political rivals and the imprisonment of his stepmother, Queen Inmok, ultimately led to his downfall.[^2]

## Prince of War

Gwanghaegun was the second son of King Seonjo. During the **Imjin War** (1592–1598), when his father fled to the Chinese border, Gwanghaegun remained to lead the provisional government.

- **Wartime Leadership:** He actively encouraged the Righteous Armies (Uibyeong) and maintained morale among the people, proving his capability as a leader during the nation's darkest hour.[^3]

## Pragmatic Diplomacy and Reform

Upon becoming king, Gwanghaegun focused on reconstruction and survival.

- **Neutral Diplomacy:** Caught between the declining Ming Dynasty (Joseon's suzerain) and the rising Later Jin (Manchu/Qing), Gwanghaegun walked a tightrope. When Ming demanded troops to fight the Manchus, he sent the army with secret instructions to surrender if necessary, preserving Joseon's forces and avoiding Manchu retaliation.[^4]
- **Daedong Law (Uniform Land Tax):** He introduced the **Daedongbeop**, changing the tax system from payment in special local products (which was prone to corruption) to payment in rice. This greatly relieved the burden on peasants.[^5]
- **Dongui Bogamt:** He sponsored the compilation of **Dongui Bogam** (Mirror of Eastern Medicine) by Heo Jun, creating one of the most important medical texts in Asian history.

## The Tyrant's Downfall

Despite his achievements, Gwanghaegun's reign was marred by paranoia and factional strife.

- **Purges:** Feeling threatened by the legitimacy of his younger half-brother (Grand Prince Yeongchang, the legitimate son of Queen Inmok), he allowed the Northern faction to execute the 8-year-old prince and imprison **Queen Inmok**.[^6]
- **Injo Restoration (1623):** The Westerner faction (Seoin), appalled by the "immoral" treatment of the Queen and the "betrayal" of Ming, launched a coup. Gwanghaegun was deposed and exiled to Jeju Island.
- **Legacy:** Unlike other kings, he was not given a temple name (like Taejo or Sejong) but remains known as a "Prince" (Gun). He died in exile 18 years later.[^7]
