## Summary
Kristen Heather Gilbert was an American serial killer and former nurse at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Northampton, Massachusetts. She murdered four patients and attempted to murder three others by injecting them with epinephrine to cause cardiac arrest. She was sentenced to life imprisonment.

## Early Life
Born November 13, 1967, in Fall River, Massachusetts. She studied nursing and married. She worked at the VAMC in Northampton beginning in 1989. She was known for being present during an unusually high number of medical emergencies. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1995 and 1996, Gilbert injected patients with epinephrine, causing cardiac arrests. She would then respond as the 'heroic' nurse attempting to save them. Three fellow nurses became suspicious of the spike in cardiac emergencies during her shifts. She also made bomb threats to the hospital to deflect attention. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
After nurses reported their concerns, an investigation revealed a statistical correlation between Gilbert's shifts and cardiac deaths. She was arrested in 1998. She was convicted of three first-degree murders and one second-degree murder in 2001, plus two attempted murders. She was sentenced to life without parole plus 20 years. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Her case led to improved monitoring of mortality rates on hospital shifts [^4]
- Prompted statistical analysis programs to detect unusual patterns in healthcare facilities
- Led to reforms in how VA hospitals investigated unusual patient deaths

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered four patients and attempted to murder three others [^5]
- Used epinephrine injections to cause cardiac arrests
- Sought attention and praise as the 'hero' who responded to emergencies she caused
- Exploited the trust placed in nurses by vulnerable patients
- Made bomb threats to the hospital to obstruct investigation
