## Summary

Helen Frankenthaler was an American abstract painter who pioneered the soak-stain technique of pouring thinned paint onto unprimed canvas. Her 1952 painting Mountains and Sea inspired Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland to create Color Field painting. Her lyrical abstractions bridge Abstract Expressionism and Color Field painting.
