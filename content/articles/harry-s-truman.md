## Summary

Harry S. Truman (May 8, 1884 – December 26, 1972) was the 33rd President of the United States, serving from 1945 to 1953. He assumed office upon Franklin D. Roosevelt's death and led the nation through the final months of World War II, making the momentous decision to use atomic weapons against Japan. A plain-spoken Midwesterner who never completed college, Truman guided America through the early Cold War, implementing the Marshall Plan, establishing NATO, and desegregating the armed forces. Though deeply unpopular when he left office, historians now rank him among America's most effective presidents.

## Early Life and Background

Harry S. Truman was born on May 8, 1884, in Lamar, Missouri, the son of John Anderson Truman, a mule trader and farmer, and Martha Ellen (Young) Truman.[^1] His distinctive middle initial "S" was a tribute to both his grandfathers, Solomon Young and Anderson Shipp Truman, and did not stand for a specific name.[^2] The family, which soon included another boy, Vivian, and a girl, Mary Jane, moved several times during Truman's childhood—first in 1887 to a farm near Grandview, then in 1890 to Independence, and finally in 1902 to Kansas City.[^3]

Young Harry did not attend conventional school until he was eight years old, having grown up immersed in farm life.[^4] Despite this late start, he proved very bright and made excellent grades throughout his education. He attended public schools in Independence, graduating from high school in 1901.[^5] History and biography were Harry's favorite subjects, and he also studied geometry, music, rhetoric, logic, and what he described as "a smattering of astronomy."[^6] Truman's early exposure to the Bible profoundly shaped his character; he later recalled, "I owe a great deal of my familiarity with the Bible to my Masonic studies—and to the fact that I read it through twice before I was twelve years old."[^7]

Truman harbored ambitions to attend West Point, but his poor eyesight foreclosed the possibility of obtaining a commission.[^8] After graduating from Independence High School in 1901, he took classes at Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school, studying bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing, but stopped after a year.[^9] Though he later took night classes at the Kansas City Law School, Harry never completed a college degree—a fact that would later distinguish him as one of the few modern presidents without formal higher education.[^10]

Following his abbreviated education, Truman worked briefly as a timekeeper for a railroad construction contractor, then as a clerk in two Kansas City banks.[^11] In 1906, he returned to Grandview to help his father run the family farm, where he would labor for more than a decade.[^12] This extended period of agricultural work instilled in him a deep appreciation for rural America and the values of hard work and integrity that would characterize his political career. On his Medicare application form years later, Truman would write "Farmer" on the line next to "Former Occupation," revealing his enduring identification with this formative period of his life.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Truman's path to political prominence began with his service in World War I. He fought in France as a captain in the 129th Field Artillery Regiment, demonstrating the leadership qualities that would serve him throughout his career.[^14] On November 11, 1918, Captain Harry's artillery unit fired some of the last shots of World War I toward German positions in Hermeville before the armistice took effect at 11 a.m.[^15] Following the war, Harry and Bess Wallace, whom he had known since childhood and courted for years, were married on June 28, 1919, at Trinity Episcopal Church in Independence, Missouri.[^16]

In 1922, Truman entered politics when he was elected to be one of three judges of the Jackson County Court.[^17] Despite the title, Judge Truman's duties were administrative rather than judicial, and he built a reputation for honesty and efficiency in the management of county affairs.[^18] This local success laid the foundation for his elevation to higher office. In 1934, Truman was elected to the United States Senate, taking his oath for the first time as a United States senator from Missouri in January 1935 as part of an all-Democratic class of freshmen.[^19]

Truman's Senate career reached its apex with his chairmanship of the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, popularly known as the "Truman Committee."[^20] This committee exposed fraud and mismanagement of military funds during World War II, saving taxpayers billions of dollars and earning Truman national recognition. His work as chairman earned him his first appearance on the cover of TIME Magazine.[^21] The success of the Truman Committee transformed him from an obscure senator into a figure of national importance.

In 1944, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Truman was nominated for the office of vice president to run alongside President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[^22] He was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1945.[^23] However, Truman had been vice president for only 82 days when President Roosevelt died suddenly on April 12, 1945, in Warm Springs, Georgia.[^24] Thrust unexpectedly into the presidency at one of history's most critical moments, with World War II still raging, Truman became the thirty-third President of the United States with virtually no preparation for the role. Roosevelt had rarely consulted with him, and Truman had not even been informed of the atomic bomb project until after he took office.

## Major Achievements

Truman's presidency was marked by momentous decisions that shaped the post-war world order. His first major accomplishment was successfully concluding World War II. Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945 (V-E Day), just weeks after Truman took office.[^25] The war in the Pacific continued, however, and Truman faced the agonizing decision of whether to use the newly developed atomic weapon. After attending the Potsdam Conference with British and Soviet leaders in July-August 1945,[^26] Truman authorized the use of atomic bombs on Japan. On August 6, 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, followed by a second bomb on Nagasaki three days later.[^27] Japan announced its surrender on August 14, 1945 (V-J Day), with the official surrender signed on September 2, 1945, aboard the USS Missouri.[^28]

In foreign policy, Truman became the principal architect of America's Cold War strategy. On March 12, 1947, he delivered his famous "Truman Doctrine" speech to Congress, requesting a $400 million appropriation to fight the spread of Communism in Greece and Turkey.[^29] This doctrine shifted U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union from a wartime alliance to containment of Soviet expansion.[^30] It marked the beginning of America's commitment to opposing communist expansion worldwide. The Truman Doctrine was followed by the Marshall Plan, announced by Secretary of State George C. Marshall on June 5, 1947, at Harvard University.[^31] On April 3, 1948, President Truman signed the Economic Assistance Act, implementing this comprehensive program of economic assistance to help devastated European nations recover from World War II.[^32]

Truman also established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which he officially signed on August 24, 1949, following the treaty's initial signing on April 4, 1949.[^33] NATO created a collective security arrangement among the United States, Canada, and several Western European nations to provide defense against potential Soviet aggression.[^34] The NATO agreement formalized the multinational pact built on the foundation established by the Truman Doctrine.[^35] When the Soviets began the blockade of Berlin in 1948, Truman made the critical decision that the United States would "stay in Berlin" and not concede the city to the Soviet sphere of influence, instead maintaining the Berlin Airlift to supply the besieged city.[^36]

In domestic policy, Truman championed the "Fair Deal," announced in his January 5, 1949 State of the Union address, declaring that "every American has a right to expect from our government a fair deal."[^37] The Fair Deal sought to preserve and extend the liberal tradition of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.[^38] Although a conservative coalition in Congress blocked many proposals, Truman achieved significant victories. Congress raised the minimum wage in 1949 from 40 to 75 cents.[^39] The Housing Act of 1949 promised to build 810,000 housing units over six years.[^40] The Social Security Act of 1950 significantly expanded the coverage offered in the original 1935 act.[^41] Congress also established the National Science Foundation, dedicated "to promote the progress of science."[^42]

Truman's most consequential domestic achievement was advancing civil rights. On July 26, 1948, he issued Executive Order 9981, banning segregation in the Armed Forces and abolishing discrimination "on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin" in the United States Armed Forces.[^43] This was the first time a president used an executive order to implement civil rights principles and represented a major victory for civil rights advocates.[^44] In the summer of 1947, Truman became the first President to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).[^45] He also used presidential executive orders to deny government contracts to firms with racially discriminatory practices.[^46] Though it took six years to fully desegregate the armed forces, with the Army's last all-Black unit deactivated in late 1954,[^47] Executive Order 9981 became a crucial step toward inspiring other parts of American society to accept desegregation.[^48]

Truman's courageous 1948 election victory also ranks among his significant achievements. Despite low approval ratings and widespread predictions of defeat, he embarked on an unprecedented "whistle-stop" tour, traveling across America by train and delivering more than 300 speeches in more than 250 cities, covering some 21,000 miles.[^49] In these speeches, Truman hammered away at Republican support for the antilabor Taft-Hartley Act and other conservative policies as crowds responded with "Give 'em hell, Harry!"[^50] His underdog campaign racked up 303 electoral votes and 49.6 percent of the popular vote to Thomas Dewey's 189 electoral votes and 45.1 percent.[^51] The Chicago Tribune's premature headline "Dewey Defeats Truman" became an iconic symbol of the greatest upset in presidential election history when Truman triumphantly held up the erroneous newspaper.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The decision to use atomic weapons against Japan remains the most controversial aspect of Truman's presidency. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in approximately 80,000 deaths in Hiroshima within the first few minutes, and 39,000 in Nagasaki after the first minute.[^53] In total, probably around two hundred thousand persons were killed in the attacks and through radiation poisoning; the vast majority were civilians, including several thousand Korean workers.[^54] The bombings were condemned as barbaric and unnecessary by high American military officers, including Eisenhower and MacArthur. Admiral William D. Leahy called the use of atomic weapons "barbarous" and stated that wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.[^55] While Truman never shirked personal responsibility for his decision and said he would do exactly the same thing given the same circumstances,[^56] considerable debate exists among historians about whether the bombs were necessary to force Japan's surrender, with some arguing Japan was already on the brink of capitulation.[^57]

Truman's handling of the Korean War generated significant controversy. In June 1950, when communist North Korea invaded South Korea across the 38th parallel,[^58] Truman committed American forces without pressing for a Congressional declaration of war. Instead, he classified the Korean conflict as a UN-led "police action," operating under the authority of the Security Council.[^59] This precedent of presidential war-making without formal congressional approval established a controversial pattern that would be repeated in future conflicts. Some historians argue that Truman too readily accepted General Douglas MacArthur's advice when he should have questioned his commanding general's assessment of Chinese intentions.[^60]

The firing of General MacArthur on April 11, 1951, while ultimately vindicated by history, proved immensely controversial at the time.[^61] MacArthur publicly advocated the more expansive use of American military power, including bombing China, employing Nationalist Chinese forces from Taiwan, and the possible use of nuclear weapons, while Truman favored a "limited war" strategy.[^62] When Truman relieved MacArthur of his command because the general was "unable to give his wholehearted support to the policies of the United States Government,"[^63] the American public overwhelmingly disapproved.[^64] MacArthur was cheered by thousands in parades across the United States, including a ticker-tape parade in New York City with an estimated 7.5 million people,[^65] and delivered his famous "Old soldiers never die, they just fade away" speech before Congress.[^66] Truman's popular approval rating plummeted to 22 percent—lower even than Nixon's during Watergate.[^67]

Truman's domestic agenda faced substantial opposition and criticism. Despite his ambitious Fair Deal proposals, which included economic controls to halt inflation, a more progressive tax structure, repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, agricultural reform, national medical insurance, expansion of Social Security, federal housing programs, aid to education, and civil rights protections,[^68] only three goals—increasing public housing programs, raising the minimum wage, and expanding Social Security—were fulfilled by Congress.[^69] A coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats from the South dominated both chambers of Congress and blocked most of his initiatives.[^70] The American Medical Association successfully lobbied against national healthcare, and the Farm Bureau Federation defeated his agricultural reform bill.[^71] Many historians contend that Truman grievously erred in 1946 and 1949 by advocating liberal initiatives that expanded the welfare state for which a conservative polity had no appetite.[^72]

Historians also criticize Truman for responding too slowly and weakly to Senator Joseph McCarthy's anticommunist crusade.[^73] Some argue that his support for African-American civil rights, while groundbreaking, was ultimately underwhelming given the magnitude of racial injustice in America.[^74] Revisionist scholars condemn his decision to pursue a Cold War with the Soviet Union and criticize his failure to secure passage of most of his Fair Deal program.[^75] Others point out that Truman's failure to keep politicians and the public more informed about U.S. policy towards the Chinese Civil War led to a damaging political firestorm after Mao's victory.[^76]

## Personal Life

Harry Truman met Bess Wallace for the first time in First Presbyterian Church's Sunday School in Independence, Missouri, when he was six years old and she was five.[^77] They were reunited in 1910, and after a lengthy courtship, they married on June 28, 1919.[^78] The newlyweds honeymooned in Chicago and Detroit and then moved into Bess's childhood home so she could care for her mother.[^79] Their only child, Margaret, was born in 1924, though Bess's two previous pregnancies had ended in miscarriages.[^80]

When Harry married Bess Wallace in 1919, he gained more than just a wife; he acquired an extended family, including Bess's three brothers—George, Frank, and Fred.[^81] The Wallaces were more than relatives, friends, or neighbors; they were part of a tightly-knit support group for the President, providing him with domestic calm and balance amid the storm of politics, government, and celebrity.[^82] Due to Bess's strong influence in his life, Harry gave her the nickname "The Boss."[^83] He frequently sought his wife's advice and opinions on his political actions.[^84]

Truman's correspondence with his wife reveals many aspects of his personality: his devotion to his family, his sense of humor, his sensitivity to criticism, and his determination to succeed.[^85] He wrote to Bess constantly—sometimes more than once a day—whenever they were apart for any length of time, demonstrating his deep and enduring affection.[^86] This voluminous correspondence provides insight into a man who, despite holding the world's most powerful office, remained fundamentally devoted to his family and Midwestern values.

Truman was known for his plain-spoken manner, blunt honesty, and sometimes salty language. His famous desk sign declaring "The Buck Stops Here" perfectly encapsulated his approach to presidential responsibility.[^87] The sign was made at the Federal Reformatory at El Reno, Oklahoma, and mailed to President Truman on October 2, 1945.[^88] As he stated in his farewell address in January 1953, "The President--whoever he is--has to decide. He can't pass the buck to anybody. No one else can do the deciding for him. That's his job."[^89] This willingness to accept full responsibility for difficult decisions, even when they proved unpopular, defined his character.

## Legacy

When Harry S. Truman left the presidency in January 1953, he was one of the most unpopular politicians in the United States.[^90] The Korean War, accusations of corruption in his administration, and the anticommunist red-baiting of McCarthy had contributed to his poor standing, and he left office with the lowest approval rating of any president to that time.[^91] However, Truman's reputation began to revive soon after he returned to private life, and his stature rose steadily in subsequent years.[^92]

As scholars and the public gained historical perspective, it became easier to discern and appreciate his significant contributions to American democracy and global stability. Historians now tend to rank Truman among the top half dozen American presidents,[^93] with critical reassessments improving his reputation among both scholars and the general population.[^94] His containment policy successfully prevented Soviet expansion without triggering World War III. The Marshall Plan rebuilt Western Europe and created the foundation for decades of prosperity and democratic governance. NATO established a security architecture that preserved peace in Europe throughout the Cold War and beyond.

Truman's domestic legacy proved equally significant. Executive Order 9981 initiated the federal government's modern civil rights efforts and demonstrated that presidential action could advance racial justice even without congressional support. The impact of this order cannot be overstated; it was among the first federal actions of the modern civil rights era to counter discrimination against Black Americans and other racial minorities.[^95] Lyndon B. Johnson credited Truman's unfulfilled Fair Deal program as influencing Great Society measures such as Medicare that Johnson successfully pushed through Congress during the 1960s.[^96]

Perhaps Truman's greatest legacy was his demonstration that an "ordinary man"—a farmer without a college degree who had been thrust unexpectedly into the presidency—could rise to meet extraordinary challenges through integrity, courage, and sound judgment. His willingness to make difficult, unpopular decisions in service of what he believed was right, whether firing MacArthur to preserve civilian control of the military or desegregating the armed forces despite fierce opposition, established enduring principles of presidential leadership. The containment strategy he initiated shaped American foreign policy for four decades until the Soviet Union's collapse.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern historians increasingly praise Truman for his decisive leadership during a critical period in American and world history. Scholars credit him with successfully managing the transition from World War II to peacetime while simultaneously establishing the architecture of the Cold War that ultimately proved successful. The Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan, and NATO are now recognized as brilliant strategic initiatives that rebuilt Western Europe, prevented Soviet expansion, and created conditions for democratic capitalism to flourish.[^97]

Truman's courage in making unpopular decisions has won particular admiration from historians. His firing of MacArthur, though politically catastrophic at the time, is now celebrated as a courageous assertion of civilian control over the military that prevented World War III.[^98] Historians acknowledge that Truman took a great political risk to prove the principle that civilian elected officials are above military officials.[^99] After seven weeks of exhaustive testimony from senior military leaders who strongly disagreed with MacArthur's plan, the public recognized the wisdom of Truman's decision.[^100]

His commitment to civil rights, particularly Executive Order 9981, is now recognized as groundbreaking, especially considering the political climate of 1948 and the opposition he faced from Southern Democrats. Scholars note that this executive order became a crucial step toward inspiring other parts of American society to accept desegregation[^101] and marked the beginning of the federal government's active role in dismantling Jim Crow. His willingness to address the NAACP and speak forthrightly about racial injustice demonstrated moral courage that few politicians of his era possessed.

Defenders argue that Truman's use of atomic weapons, while tragic, saved hundreds of thousands of American and Japanese lives that would have been lost in an invasion of Japan's home islands. They point to contemporary estimates suggesting that Operation Downfall, the planned invasion, would have resulted in casualties dwarfing even the terrible toll of the atomic bombs. Scholars also credit Truman's plain-spoken integrity and willingness to accept responsibility—embodied in his "The Buck Stops Here" motto—as a model of presidential accountability that contrasts favorably with the evasiveness of many subsequent administrations.

### Negative Views

Critics of Truman argue that his foreign policy was needlessly aggressive and helped create the Cold War rather than merely responding to Soviet expansionism. Revisionist historians contend that his confrontational approach toward the Soviet Union, particularly the decision to use atomic weapons and later refusal to share nuclear technology, poisoned relations with Stalin and made conflict inevitable. They suggest that more diplomatic engagement might have prevented decades of dangerous nuclear standoff.

Scholars critical of the atomic bombings argue that Japan was already on the brink of surrender and that the weapons were unnecessary. They point to the views of military leaders like Eisenhower, MacArthur, and Admiral Leahy, who believed the bombings were militarily unnecessary and morally indefensible.[^102] Critics contend that Truman used the weapons primarily to intimidate the Soviet Union and establish American dominance in the post-war world rather than to save American lives. The fact that the only formal "strike order" on the atomic bomb was drafted by General Groves and approved by Secretary Stimson and Chief of Staff George Marshall—and that it is unclear whether Truman himself ever saw it directly prior to it being issued[^103]—raises questions about the decision-making process.

Historians critical of Truman's domestic record argue that he failed to achieve most of his Fair Deal agenda, demonstrating either poor political skills or unrealistic ambitions. They note that he was unable to build the coalitions necessary to overcome the conservative opposition in Congress,[^104] and that his advocacy of liberal initiatives for which the public had no appetite damaged the Democratic Party politically.[^105] His response to McCarthyism has been characterized as weak and belated, allowing the senator's destructive campaign to damage countless lives before eventually subsiding.

Critics also argue that while Executive Order 9981 was symbolically important, Truman's overall civil rights record was insufficient given the magnitude of racial injustice in America. They note that he failed to push for comprehensive civil rights legislation and that the desegregation of the military took six years to complete, suggesting a lack of urgency. Some historians point out that his civil rights advocacy may have been motivated more by political calculation—securing Black votes in Northern cities—than by moral conviction, noting that he made few concrete efforts to dismantle segregation outside the military.
