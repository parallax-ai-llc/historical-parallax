## Summary

Elijah McCoy invented the automatic lubricator for steam engines, which allowed trains to be lubricated while running rather than stopping. His inventions were so reliable that buyers would ask for 'the real McCoy' to distinguish his products from inferior imitations — the likely origin of the famous phrase. He held 57 patents over his career.
