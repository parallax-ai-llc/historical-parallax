## Overview

The Bhopal gas tragedy (December 2-3, 1984) was the world's worst industrial disaster. A leak of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas from a Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal, India, killed thousands in their sleep and left hundreds of thousands with lifelong health problems. Official death tolls range from 3,787 to over 16,000, with some estimates much higher. The disaster exposed catastrophic failures in industrial safety, corporate responsibility, and government regulation. Decades later, the site remains contaminated, victims still suffer, and justice has largely been denied. Bhopal became synonymous with corporate negligence and the vulnerability of poor communities to industrial hazards.

## Background

### Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL)

**Parent Company:** Union Carbide Corporation (USA)
**Plant:** Pesticide factory producing Sevin (carbaryl)
**Location:** Urban area of Bhopal, capital of Madhya Pradesh
**Key Chemical:** Methyl isocyanate (MIC)—extremely toxic, used in pesticide production

### Safety Concerns Before Disaster

**Cost-Cutting:**
- Safety systems neglected
- Refrigeration for MIC storage turned off
- Scrubber (gas neutralizer) insufficient
- Flare tower disconnected
- Staff reduced from 850 to 642
- Many safety protocols ignored

**Earlier Incidents:**
Multiple MIC leaks and deaths in years before disaster. Journalists warned of danger.

## The Night of December 2-3, 1984

### The Leak

**11:00 PM (Dec 2):**
Water entered Tank 610 containing 42 tons of MIC (whether by sabotage, accident, or maintenance error remains disputed).

**Chemical Reaction:**
Water caused exothermic (heat-producing) reaction. Tank pressure and temperature rose rapidly. MIC began vaporizing.

**12:30 AM (Dec 3):**
Safety valve gave way. Massive cloud of MIC gas (and reaction products) released.

**Wind:**
Light winds carried toxic cloud over densely populated slums near plant.

### Gas Cloud

**40 Tons of Gas:**
Denser than air, stayed close to ground. Invisible in dark.

**Effects:**
MIC attacks:
- Eyes (burning, blindness)
- Lungs (fluid buildup, suffocation)
- Nervous system

**Symptoms:**
Victims woke choking, vomiting, eyes burning. Many ran into streets in panic—exertion worsened inhalation.

## The Catastrophe

### Immediate Deaths

**In Their Sleep:**
Thousands died in their beds from gas exposure.

**In Flight:**
Others collapsed in streets while fleeing.

**Hospitals Overwhelmed:**
Doctors had no idea what gas was or how to treat it.

### Chaos

**No Warning:**
Plant alarm sounded late and was turned off.

**No Evacuation:**
Authorities didn't know what was happening. No plan existed.

**Bodies Everywhere:**
Streets littered with human and animal corpses by dawn.

## Casualties

### Death Toll (Disputed)

**Official (Indian Government):** 3,787 immediate deaths
**Other Estimates:** 8,000-16,000 immediate deaths
**Activist Groups:** 25,000+ total deaths over years

### Affected Population

**500,000+ Exposed:**
Most of Bhopal's population was exposed to some degree.

**Long-Term Health Effects:**
- Blindness
- Respiratory diseases (COPD, asthma)
- Immune system disorders
- Birth defects
- Cancer
- Neurological damage
- Reproductive problems

**Continued Suffering:**
Second and third generations born with health problems.

## Aftermath

### Corporate Response

**Warren Anderson (Union Carbide CEO):**
Arrested upon arrival in India, released on bail, fled country. Never extradited. Died 2014.

**Sabotage Claim:**
Union Carbide blamed disgruntled worker for introducing water. Evidence disputed.

**Settlement (1989):**
Union Carbide paid $470 million—approximately $500 per victim. Widely criticized as grossly inadequate.

### Legal Battles

**Criminal Case (India):**
2010: Seven Indian executives convicted of "causing death by negligence"—sentenced to 2 years (maximum). Widely condemned as mockery of justice.

**Civil Case (USA):**
Dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.

**Dow Chemical:**
Acquired Union Carbide (2001). Refuses responsibility for Bhopal. Activists still campaigning.

## Site Contamination

### Continuing Pollution

**Factory Abandoned:**
Plant never cleaned up. Toxic chemicals remain stored and leaking.

**Groundwater:**
Soil and groundwater contaminated with heavy metals, pesticides.

**Residents Still Exposed:**
Communities around plant continue to drink contaminated water.

**Studies:**
Elevated levels of toxins found in local population.

---

## Justice Denied

### Why No Justice?

- Corporate legal maneuvering
- Weak Indian government response
- Reluctance to pursue extradition
- Poverty of victims (little political power)
- Deaths of key defendants
- Statute of limitations

### Ongoing Activism

**Survivors' organizations:**
Continue advocating for:
- Full cleanup
- Adequate compensation
- Medical care
- Criminal prosecution

**International Campaigns:**
Olympics ban on Dow Chemical. Corporate accountability movements.

## Lessons and Legacy

### Industrial Safety

Bhopal prompted:
- Stricter global regulations on hazardous industries
- "Right to Know" laws
- Enhanced emergency planning
- OSHA Process Safety Management rules

### Corporate Responsibility

Remains case study in:
- What happens when profits override safety
- Double standards between developed and developing world
- Long-term corporate liability

### Environmental Justice

Poor communities bear disproportionate industrial risk.
