## Summary

Luis Bunuel was a Spanish-Mexican filmmaker who was the cinema's greatest Surrealist. His first film Un Chien Andalou (with Dali) shocked audiences, and his final films including The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and That Obscure Object of Desire demonstrate his lifelong subversion of bourgeois morality and religious hypocrisy.
