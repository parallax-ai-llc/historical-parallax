## Summary

Évariste Galois was a French mathematician who, despite dying at age 20 in a duel, made foundational contributions to abstract algebra. He developed Galois theory, which connects field theory and group theory, providing a criterion for determining whether polynomial equations can be solved by radicals. The night before his fatal duel, he wrote down his mathematical ideas in a letter that became one of the most famous documents in mathematics history.
