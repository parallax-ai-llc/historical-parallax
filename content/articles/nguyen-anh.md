## Summary

Nguyen Anh (1762-1820), posthumously known as Emperor Gia Long, was the founding emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty, Vietnam's last imperial dynasty that ruled from 1802 until 1945.[^1] After surviving the massacre of his family during the Tay Son rebellion as a 15-year-old prince, he spent twenty-five years fighting to reclaim power, ultimately unifying Vietnam's fractured territories in 1802.[^2] His reign was characterized by conservative Confucian governance, significant administrative reforms modeled on Chinese bureaucracy, and the establishment of Hue as Vietnam's new capital.[^3] Despite achieving national unification, his legacy remains controversial due to his restrictive policies toward women's rights, economic isolationism, and his alliance with French forces that later provided justification for colonial intervention.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Nguyen Anh was born on February 8, 1762, in Phu Xuan (modern-day Hue, central Vietnam), during a period of significant political instability.[^5] He had two other childhood names: Nguyen Phuc Chung and Nguyen Phuc Noan, reflecting the complex naming traditions of Vietnamese royalty.[^6] As the third son of Nguyen Phuc Luan and Nguyen Thi Hoan, young Nguyen Anh belonged to the powerful Nguyen lord family that controlled southern Vietnam.[^7] His grandfather, Lord Nguyen Phuc Khoat, ruled the southern territories, but the family's internal politics would profoundly shape Nguyen Anh's early years.

According to historical accounts, Nguyen Anh's father Luan was originally designated as heir to Lord Khoat's position.[^8] However, in 1765, a high-ranking mandarin named Truong Phuc Loan allegedly altered Khoat's will of succession on his deathbed, installing Luan's younger brother Nguyen Phuc Thuan, the sixteenth son, on the throne instead.[^9] Luan was subsequently imprisoned and died the same year, leaving the three-year-old Nguyen Anh without his father's protection.[^10] This early tragedy and political manipulation would have lasting effects on the young prince's understanding of power and court intrigue.

At this time, Nguyen Anh was merely a minor member of the royal family without any political support among court powerbrokers.[^11] He grew up in relative obscurity within the Nguyen court, receiving a traditional Confucian education befitting a prince but lacking the political connections that typically accompanied higher-ranking royals.[^12] The young prince developed a love of poetry and literature during these formative years, often composing his own verses, which would remain a lifelong passion.[^13] He also became deeply devoted to Confucian teachings and developed great admiration for Chinese culture, values that would profoundly influence his later governance.[^14]

The relatively peaceful if politically marginalized existence of Nguyen Anh's youth would be shattered in 1777 when he was just fifteen years old. The Tay Son rebellion, a massive peasant uprising led by three brothers from the Tay Son region, swept through southern Vietnam with devastating force.[^15] The Tay Son forces successfully captured and executed nearly the entire Nguyen royal family in a brutal purge.[^16] Only Nguyen Anh managed to escape, fleeing with the help of a few loyal supporters into the swamps and marshlands of the western Mekong Delta.[^17] This traumatic experience—losing his entire family and becoming a fugitive in his own land—transformed the young prince from an obscure royal into a determined survivor with a singular goal: reclaiming his family's legacy and reunifying Vietnam under Nguyen rule.

## Rise to Power

Nguyen Anh's rise to power was an extraordinary twenty-five-year struggle marked by devastating defeats, strategic retreats, foreign alliances, and ultimate triumph.[^18] In the immediate aftermath of the 1777 massacre, the teenage prince found refuge in Ha Tien on the southern coastal tip of Vietnam, where he encountered a French Catholic bishop named Pierre Pigneau de Behaine.[^19] This meeting would prove pivotal to Nguyen Anh's eventual success, as Pigneau became his closest adviser and international advocate, playing a major role in securing the foreign support necessary for his military campaigns.[^20]

The marshlands and swamps of the Mekong Delta became Nguyen Anh's initial base of operations.[^21] The difficult terrain provided natural protection against Tay Son attacks, allowing him to gradually consolidate control over the fertile provinces of the region.[^22] With the support of the Dong Son army, a local military group loyal to the Nguyen cause, Nguyen Anh proclaimed himself king (vuong) and ascended to a provisional throne in 1780.[^23] He eliminated the powerful general Do Thanh Nhon, acquired direct command of the Dong Son forces, and established direct contact with the population of Gia Dinh (modern-day Saigon), building a power base from which to challenge the Tay Son.[^24]

However, the path to victory was far from straightforward. In 1785, Nguyen Anh suffered one of his most devastating defeats at the Battle of Rach Gam-Xoai Mut.[^25] Seeking to decisively crush the last Nguyen resistance, Nguyen Anh called upon the King of Siam for military intervention.[^26] The Siamese committed a massive force of 50,000 troops and over 300 warships to support Nguyen Anh's cause.[^27] However, the brilliant Tay Son commander Nguyen Hue anticipated the Siamese move and positioned his forces strategically along the Mekong River.[^28] When the Siamese fleet became strung out between Rach Gam and Xoai Mut, Nguyen Hue's forces attacked with devastating effect, destroying virtually the entire Siamese navy.[^29] Only 2,000 to 3,000 men from the original 50,000-strong expedition escaped.[^30] Nguyen Anh himself barely survived, fleeing with just a dozen men to Ha Tien before eventually seeking refuge in Bangkok until August 1787.[^31]

This crushing defeat might have ended another man's ambitions, but Nguyen Anh proved remarkably resilient. During his exile in Siam, Bishop Pigneau de Behaine traveled to France on his behalf, securing the 1787 Treaty of Versailles between French King Louis XVI and Prince Nguyen Anh.[^32] The treaty promised French military assistance in exchange for extensive commercial concessions and the grant of the port of Da Nang and the Con Son islands.[^33] Although the French government, strained by the eve of the French Revolution, could not follow through with official support, Pigneau de Behaine persisted.[^34] With support from French merchants and private individuals, he mounted a force of French soldiers and officers that provided crucial modern military expertise to Nguyen Anh's armies.[^35]

The French assistance transformed Nguyen Anh's military capabilities. French advisers supervised the building of forts, shipyards, cannon foundries, and bomb factories, and instructed Vietnamese forces in the manufacture and use of modern European armaments.[^36] This technological advantage, combined with growing divisions within the Tay Son leadership following the death of their brilliant commander Nguyen Hue (Emperor Quang Trung) in 1792, gradually shifted the balance of power.[^37] The new Tay Son leaders proved unable to deal effectively with the problems of famine and natural disasters that wracked the war-torn country, further weakening their position.[^38]

Nguyen Anh launched a systematic campaign of reconquest. In 1792, he attempted another invasion with foreign support but was again repelled by Tay Son forces at the Battle of Qui Nhon.[^39] Undeterred, he continued building his forces and modernizing his military with French assistance. By 1800, Nguyen Anh had gained sufficient strength to occupy Quy Nhon citadel.[^40] In 1801, his forces captured Phu Xuan (Hue), forcing the Tay Son emperor Nguyen Quang Toan to flee to Thang Long (Hanoi).[^41] The final assault came in 1802 when Nguyen Anh besieged Thang Long.[^42] The twenty-year-old Nguyen Quang Toan attempted to escape but was captured and executed, ending the Tay Son dynasty after just twenty-four years of rule.[^43] On July 22, 1802, Hanoi fell to Nguyen Anh's forces, completing the reunification of Vietnam.[^44]

## Major Achievements

On June 1, 1802, Nguyen Anh proclaimed himself emperor, adopting the reign name "Gia Long" to symbolize the unification of the country—"Gia" from Gia Dinh (Saigon in the south) and "Long" from Thang Long (Hanoi in the north).[^45] This symbolic naming reflected his greatest achievement: the reunification of Vietnam after three centuries of division between the Trinh lords in the north and the Nguyen lords in the south.[^46] For the first time in Vietnamese history, a single ruler controlled territories that encompass modern-day Vietnam, establishing a unified state that would persist in some form until the present day.[^47]

Gia Long's administrative reforms fundamentally restructured Vietnamese governance. Recognizing that the newly unified country's center of gravity had moved southward, he relocated the capital from Hanoi to Hue, a more central location that better reflected Vietnam's geographic and political reality.[^48] In his drive for control and order, Gia Long adopted the Chinese bureaucratic model to a greater degree than any previous Vietnamese ruler.[^49] He established a centralized bureaucracy modeled on the Chinese six-ministry system, creating departments for personnel, revenue, rites, war, punishment, and public works.[^50] This Confucian-based governance system emphasized hierarchical relationships, moral cultivation of officials, and the supremacy of imperial authority.[^51]

One of Gia Long's most significant and enduring achievements was the promulgation of the Gia Long Code.[^52] Work on this comprehensive legal code began in 1811 under a group of scholars led by Nguyen Van Thanh, and the code was officially issued in 1812 (though some sources cite 1815).[^53] Consisting of 398 articles, the code was heavily influenced by the Qing dynasty's legal system and incorporated Confucian moral principles into Vietnamese law.[^54] The code would remain in effect until 1880, providing legal continuity throughout much of the Nguyen dynasty's reign.[^55] It covered criminal law, administrative regulations, property rights, family law, and social hierarchies, establishing a comprehensive framework for governance that emphasized traditional values and social order.[^56]

Gia Long also implemented significant infrastructural and territorial consolidation projects. He oversaw the construction of the Imperial City in Hue, which became a magnificent architectural complex that served as the political and ceremonial center of the dynasty.[^57] His tomb, the Thien Tho Mausoleum, was constructed from 1814 to 1820 and became a masterpiece of Vietnamese imperial architecture.[^58] Covering over 28 square kilometers and designed as a double tomb to symbolize his profound love for Empress Thua Thien, it remains one of the most spectacular monuments within the UNESCO-recognized Complex of Hue Monuments.[^59]

Under Gia Long's rule, Vietnam expanded its territorial reach and consolidated control over previously contested regions. While the complete annexation of the remaining Cham territories would occur under his successor Minh Mang in 1832, Gia Long maintained favorable relations with the Cham people and secured Vietnam's dominance in the region.[^60] Vietnamese control over Cambodian territories in the Mekong Delta, which had begun in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, was further consolidated under his rule.[^61] The Nguyen dynasty established the first well-defined imperial administrative and bureaucratic system that could effectively govern these diverse territories.[^62]

Gia Long demonstrated remarkable skill in maintaining Vietnam's independence despite his reliance on foreign assistance. While reorganizing his domain on a conservative Confucian and Chinese model, he increased Vietnam's power in Southeast Asia and successfully kept Western imperialist nations at bay during his lifetime.[^63] His careful management of foreign relations, combined with his military strength and administrative reforms, created a unified Vietnamese state capable of resisting external pressures that had fragmented the country in previous centuries.[^64]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements in unifying Vietnam, Gia Long's reign was marked by significant controversies that have generated intense historical debate. His deep conservatism and rigid adherence to Confucian philosophy led to policies that modern scholars view as regressive, particularly regarding women's rights and social equality.[^65] The Gia Long Code, while providing legal structure, "took away women's rights and tried to impose a Chinese system on Vietnamese society" that was more restrictive than previous Vietnamese legal traditions.[^66] The code "only stipulated the sons' rights to inheritance," and daughters could inherit property "only when there was in the family or the family line no man eligible for the inheritance."[^67] This represented a significant step backward from the more progressive Hong Duc Code of 1483, which had granted Vietnamese women relatively greater legal rights and social standing.[^68]

Gia Long's economic policies have been widely criticized as shortsighted and detrimental to Vietnam's development. In 1806, he imposed the "Sea Ban policy," which banned all Vietnamese overseas business and prohibited Western merchants from entering Vietnam.[^69] This marked a dramatic reversal from Vietnam's earlier openness to international trade; during the 17th century, Vietnam had been the third-largest economic power in East Asia and Southeast Asia, with its economy heavily dependent on maritime commerce.[^70] Gia Long's isolationist approach closed off Vietnam from international trade and technological exchange at precisely the moment when European powers were expanding their commercial and colonial networks throughout Asia.[^71] Critics note that "he was unable to spur economic growth and earned a reputation for cruelty" in his governance.[^72]

Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Gia Long's legacy concerns his alliance with French forces. While this partnership proved essential to his military success, it created long-lasting problems for Vietnam's independence. The 1787 Treaty of Versailles, arranged by Bishop Pigneau de Behaine, granted France extensive commercial concessions and territorial rights in exchange for military assistance.[^73] Although the treaty was never fully implemented during Gia Long's lifetime, "the terms of the 1787 Treaty of Alliance would remain one of the justifications of French forces when they demanded the remittance of Da Nang in 1847."[^74] Modern Vietnamese historians view "his alliance with foreigners as problematical," arguing that it laid the groundwork for French colonial intervention that would eventually subjugate Vietnam for nearly a century.[^75]

Gia Long's governance style has been criticized as excessively conservative and lacking innovation. Historical assessments note that he "was a careful leader who isn't known for coming up with new ideas."[^76] He "didn't think that foreign trade was important for Vietnam's growth, so he didn't use new European technologies or try to make more business deals with European countries" despite having access to Western knowledge through his French advisers.[^77] This conservatism extended to his social policies, where he favored traditional elite interests over broader social reform, perpetuating social hierarchies that disadvantaged peasants and commoners who had supported the Tay Son movement's more egalitarian vision.[^78]

The human cost of Gia Long's twenty-five-year military campaign was immense. The wars against the Tay Son "exacerbated peasant grievances and political unrest" throughout Vietnam.[^79] Decades of continuous warfare devastated the countryside, disrupted agriculture, and caused widespread suffering among the civilian population. While Gia Long ultimately achieved unification, the methods employed—including brutal suppression of Tay Son supporters and the execution of captured leaders like the young Nguyen Quang Toan—have led historians to question whether the human toll justified the outcome.[^80]

## Personal Life

Gia Long's personal life reflected the complex political calculations and traditional practices of Vietnamese royalty. He married for the first time in 1780 during the war against the Tay Son, taking as his first wife Tong Thi Lan, the daughter of a Nguyen general.[^81] This marriage served both personal and political purposes, cementing alliances with powerful military families. Tong Thi Lan bore him two sons, the eldest being Crown Prince Nguyen Canh, who was expected to succeed his father.[^82] However, Crown Prince Canh died from smallpox during the war years, creating a succession crisis that would have significant implications for the dynasty's future.[^83]

His second wife, Tran Thi Dang, was the daughter of one of his ministers, again reflecting the political nature of royal marriages.[^84] She bore him three sons and was later given the title Empress Thuan Thien, becoming the official empress of the dynasty.[^85] Gia Long married for the third time after he successfully conquered Vietnam and established his dynasty. His third wife, Le Ngoc Binh, was the daughter of Le Hien Tong, the second-to-last emperor of the Le Dynasty.[^86] This marriage had profound symbolic and political significance, as it united the Nguyen and Le dynasties and legitimized Nguyen claims to imperial authority. Le Ngoc Binh bore him two sons and two daughters.[^87]

Beyond his three principal wives, Gia Long maintained approximately 100 concubines.[^88] Many of these marriages were strategic alliances, as he married daughters of his officials to ensure the loyalty of his inner circle.[^89] This practice of political marriage was common among Vietnamese emperors, but the scale of Gia Long's marital alliances reflected both traditional royal privilege and pragmatic statecraft in maintaining control over a newly unified and potentially unstable realm.

The succession question dominated the later years of Gia Long's reign. After Crown Prince Nguyen Phuc Canh's death, it was initially expected that Canh's son would become emperor according to traditional succession rules.[^90] However, in 1816, Gia Long made the controversial decision to choose Nguyen Phuc Dam, the son of his second wife Empress Thuan Thien, as his successor.[^91] This decision departed from traditional primogeniture and bypassed Canh's descendants. Historical sources suggest Gia Long made this choice because Nguyen Phuc Dam "was strong and did not like Westerners, unlike Canh's family who had become Catholic and were less traditional."[^92] When it was discovered that Crown Prince Canh's family had converted to Catholicism, they were permanently cut from the succession line.[^93] This decision reflected Gia Long's commitment to Confucian orthodoxy and his concerns about Western influence, despite his own reliance on French military support.

Gia Long's personality has been described as cautious, methodical, and deeply traditional. He was "a cautious ruler, a devoted follower of the teachings of Confucius and a great admirer of Chinese culture."[^94] His love of poetry and literature persisted throughout his life, and he continued composing verses even during the demanding years of warfare and administration.[^95] Unlike some rulers who embraced innovation, Gia Long was fundamentally conservative in his approach to governance and social change, preferring time-tested Confucian principles to experimental reforms.[^96]

## Legacy

Emperor Gia Long died on February 3, 1820, and was buried at the Thien Tho Tomb with elaborate imperial honors.[^97] He was posthumously named The To Cao Hoang De, a title reflecting his status as the founding ancestor of the dynasty.[^98] His chosen successor, Nguyen Phuc Dam, ascended the throne as Emperor Minh Mang on February 14, 1820, and would rule until 1841, consolidating many of his father's policies while taking them in even more conservative directions.[^99]

Gia Long's most undeniable legacy was the unification of Vietnam. After a quarter-century of continuous fighting, he unified formerly fractious territories and established what is now modern Vietnam, elevating his family to a position never previously occupied by any Vietnamese royalty.[^100] The Nguyen Dynasty he founded would last until 1945, when Emperor Bao Dai abdicated following the August Revolution, making it Vietnam's last imperial dynasty.[^101] The administrative and bureaucratic systems he established provided the framework for Vietnamese governance throughout the 19th century and influenced state structures even after the dynasty's fall.[^102]

The architectural and cultural heritage of Gia Long's reign remains visible today. The Imperial City in Hue, though damaged during the Vietnam War, stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and testament to Nguyen dynasty grandeur.[^103] His tomb complex continues to attract visitors as one of the most impressive examples of Vietnamese imperial architecture, with its harmonious integration of natural landscapes and traditional design principles.[^104] These monuments serve as tangible connections to Vietnam's imperial past and the vision of the emperor who unified the nation.[^105]

However, Gia Long's legacy remains deeply contested among historians and the Vietnamese people. Modern Vietnamese historiography has undergone significant evolution in assessing his rule, transitioning from traditional Confucian perspectives to modern nationalist and Marxist interpretations.[^106] "The story of modern Vietnam cannot be fully understood except in the context of residual regional strains through the alternative solutions that Nguyen Hue and Nguyen Anh brought to the legacy of Dai Viet."[^107] This historiographical complexity reflects fundamental questions about whether Gia Long's conservative, elite-centered unification was superior to the Tay Son movement's more populist and egalitarian vision.

The alliance with France continues to generate the most intense debate. While Gia Long successfully maintained Vietnamese independence during his lifetime, the commercial and territorial concessions granted to France "laid groundwork for later French colonial expansion in Vietnam."[^108] When French forces began their conquest of Vietnam in the 1850s and 1860s, they explicitly cited the 1787 treaty and subsequent agreements as justification for their intervention.[^109] This raises uncomfortable questions about whether Gia Long's short-term tactical alliance unwittingly facilitated the long-term strategic disaster of French colonialism.

His conservative social policies, particularly regarding women's rights, represent another contentious aspect of his legacy. The Gia Long Code's restrictions on women's legal rights and social status reversed more progressive earlier Vietnamese traditions and imposed patriarchal Confucian norms that would persist for decades.[^110] Modern scholars debate whether these policies reflected genuine Confucian conviction or political calculation designed to secure support from conservative elites, but their impact on Vietnamese society remained significant regardless of motivation.[^111]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholarly defenders of Gia Long emphasize his extraordinary achievement in unifying Vietnam after centuries of division. After three hundred years during which northern and southern Vietnam were ruled by separate regimes, Gia Long "united Vietnam after a three-hundred-year division of the country," creating for the first time a single Vietnamese state encompassing the territories of modern Vietnam.[^112] This unification established Vietnam's modern geographic boundaries and created a foundation for Vietnamese national identity that transcended regional divisions.[^113]

Historians sympathetic to Gia Long note the immense challenges he overcame to achieve unification. As a teenage refugee who had lost his entire family, he spent twenty-five years fighting against a militarily superior enemy, suffering devastating defeats yet never abandoning his goal.[^114] His resilience, strategic thinking, and ability to forge crucial alliances demonstrated exceptional leadership qualities. The military campaigns he conducted required not only personal courage but also sophisticated logistical planning, diplomatic skill in maintaining foreign support, and the ability to inspire loyalty among his followers through decades of hardship.[^115]

Defenders of Gia Long's administrative reforms argue that his Confucian bureaucratic system, while conservative, provided stability and effective governance for a newly unified country that had experienced decades of warfare and instability.[^116] The establishment of a merit-based civil service examination system, standardized legal codes, and hierarchical administrative structures created institutional continuity that allowed the Nguyen Dynasty to govern effectively for over a century.[^117] Vietnam's last kingdom under the Nguyen Dynasty developed a sophisticated state structure that enabled governance of a geographically diverse territory stretching from the Chinese border to the Mekong Delta.[^118]

Some scholars present more nuanced views of controversial policies. Regarding the Gia Long Code and women's rights, one perspective argues that "under King Gia Long's reign, feminism took a new step forward" and the code "opposed the backward oppression of women advocated by Confucianism itself."[^119] This interpretation suggests the code provided certain protections such as requiring wives' consent for property sales and limiting polygamy, though this view remains contested among historians.[^120]

Gia Long's religious tolerance, particularly toward Catholics, stands in marked contrast to his successors and reflects positively on his character. "Emperor Gia Long tolerated the Catholic faith and permitted unimpeded missionary activities out of respect for his foreign benefactors."[^121] At the time of his death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam, and missionary activity flourished under his protection.[^122] This tolerance demonstrated political pragmatism and personal gratitude toward Bishop Pigneau de Behaine and other French supporters who had been instrumental in his victory.[^123]

### Negative Views

Critics of Gia Long view his reign as a tragic missed opportunity for Vietnam to pursue a more progressive and independent path. The Tay Son movement, which he defeated, had implemented land reforms, reduced taxation on peasants, and promoted social mobility based on merit rather than aristocratic birth.[^124] By crushing the Tay Son and restoring an even more conservative social order than had existed before, Gia Long "exacerbated peasant grievances and political unrest" and reversed whatever progressive gains had been achieved.[^125]

Historians critical of Gia Long's foreign policy argue that his French alliance was a catastrophic strategic error with long-term consequences far outweighing its short-term benefits. Modern Vietnamese historians view "his alliance with foreigners as problematical," arguing it compromised Vietnamese sovereignty and created the legal and diplomatic framework that France would later exploit.[^126] The 1787 treaty's provisions granting France commercial privileges and territorial concessions "would remain one of the justifications of French forces when they demanded the remittance of Da Nang in 1847," directly facilitating colonial intervention.[^127] From this perspective, Gia Long bears significant responsibility for making Vietnam vulnerable to French colonization, even though the actual conquest occurred decades after his death.

Economic historians criticize Gia Long's isolationist policies as disastrous for Vietnam's development. His 1806 Sea Ban policy, which "banned all Vietnamese overseas business and stopped Western merchants from entering Vietnam," closed the country off from international trade precisely when global commerce was expanding rapidly.[^128] Vietnam had been "the third-largest economic power in East Asia and Southeast Asia" during the 17th century, but Gia Long's isolationism squandered this advantageous position.[^129] Critics argue he "was unable to spur economic growth" and failed to capitalize on Vietnam's geographic position and resources.[^130]

Scholars focused on social history condemn Gia Long's treatment of women and implementation of restrictive gender policies. The Gia Long Code "was harsh on women's rights" and represented a significant regression from earlier Vietnamese legal traditions that had granted women relatively greater autonomy and legal standing.[^131] By imposing a Chinese Confucian model that emphasized patriarchal authority and male primacy, Gia Long's legal code "took away women's rights and tried to impose a Chinese system on Vietnamese society" that was incompatible with Vietnamese cultural traditions.[^132]

The manner of Gia Long's consolidation of power also draws criticism. His execution of the young Tay Son emperor Nguyen Quang Toan, who was only twenty years old when captured, and his suppression of Tay Son supporters demonstrated the ruthlessness underlying his rule.[^133] While such actions were not unusual for the era, they reveal the violent foundations of his dynasty and the human cost of his pursuit of power.[^134] His reputation for cruelty, combined with policies that favored aristocratic elites over common people, suggests a ruler more concerned with dynastic glory than the welfare of his subjects.[^135]

Contemporary Vietnamese historiography continues to grapple with Gia Long's complex and contradictory legacy. "The reconstruction of Nguyen Anh's life and afterlife involves understanding the discursive dynamics behind historical truth claims that have been continually retold over the past two centuries, unfolding through a pivotal shift from traditional Confucian to modern nationalist and Marxist historiographical modes."[^136] This ongoing scholarly debate reflects fundamental disagreements about what Gia Long represents: a unifying national hero who created modern Vietnam, or a conservative reactionary whose policies weakened Vietnam and made it vulnerable to colonization.
