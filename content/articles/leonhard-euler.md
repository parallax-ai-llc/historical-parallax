## Summary

Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) was a Swiss polymath who revolutionized mathematics and became the most prolific mathematician in history, producing an estimated quarter of all mathematical output in the 18th century.[^1] Born in Basel, Switzerland, he spent most of his career in St. Petersburg and Berlin, founding graph theory and topology while making groundbreaking contributions to calculus, number theory, and mathematical notation.[^2] Despite becoming almost completely blind in his later years, Euler's productivity actually increased, averaging one mathematical paper per week in 1775.[^3] His 866 publications and vast correspondence established him as arguably the greatest mathematician of the 18th century, with his notation and terminology still forming the foundation of modern mathematics.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Leonhard Euler was born on April 15, 1707, in Basel, Switzerland, to Paul III Euler, a pastor of the Reformed Church, and Marguerite Brucker.[^5] As the oldest of four children, with two younger sisters (Anna Maria and Maria Magdalena) and a younger brother (Johann Heinrich), Leonhard grew up in a religious household that valued education and intellectual development.[^6] Shortly after his birth, the Euler family moved from Basel to the nearby village of Riehen, where his father became pastor of the local church and where Leonhard spent most of his formative childhood years.[^7]

From an early age, Euler received mathematical instruction from his father, who had previously studied under the renowned mathematician Jacob Bernoulli at the University of Basel.[^8] This early exposure to advanced mathematical concepts laid the groundwork for Euler's exceptional abilities. Around the age of eight, young Leonhard was sent to live at his maternal grandmother's house in Basel and enrolled in the Latin school there.[^9] By most accounts, this school provided a rather poor education, and Euler learned no mathematics from the curriculum itself.[^10] However, recognizing the boy's potential, his family arranged for private tutoring from Johannes Burckhardt, a young theologian who possessed a keen interest in mathematics.[^11]

Paul Euler initially intended for his son to follow in his footsteps and enter the ministry, and with this goal in mind, he sent Leonhard to the University of Basel in 1720 to prepare for a career in the church.[^12] Euler entered the university at the remarkably young age of thirteen, first obtaining a general education before advancing to more specialized studies.[^13] However, fate intervened in the form of Johann Bernoulli, one of Europe's preeminent mathematicians and the younger brother of Euler's father's former teacher.[^14]

The young Euler, recognizing an extraordinary opportunity, personally engineered private tuition sessions with Johann Bernoulli, who soon discovered his student's exceptional mathematical talent.[^15] Despite the elder Bernoulli's demanding reputation and busy schedule, he agreed to answer Euler's questions every Saturday afternoon, though he insisted that Euler work diligently on his own throughout the week and come prepared with specific questions about difficult points.[^16] This arrangement proved transformative for Euler's mathematical development.

At the remarkably young age of fifteen, in 1723, Euler received his Bachelor's degree from the University of Basel, followed one year later by his Master's degree in Philosophy.[^17] His Master's thesis compared the philosophical systems of René Descartes and Isaac Newton, demonstrating his ability to engage with complex theoretical frameworks even at such a tender age.[^18] The Bernoulli family, particularly Johann and his sons Daniel and Nicolaus, recognized Euler's extraordinary gift and convinced Paul Euler that his son's mathematical talents should not be wasted on theology.[^19] Thus, at a very young age, Euler was granted freedom to pursue a career in mathematics, a decision that would prove monumentally significant for the history of science.[^20]

## Rise to Prominence

Euler's transition from promising student to recognized mathematician began through his connection with the Bernoulli family, which would prove instrumental in launching his career.[^21] In 1726, Euler finished his studies at the University of Basel and submitted his first significant work to the Grand Prize competition of the Paris Academy of Sciences.[^22] His entry concerned the optimal placement of masts on ships, and though he won second place (the first prize going to Pierre Bouguer, who would later be known as "the father of naval architecture"), this achievement brought the young mathematician to international attention.[^23]

The following year, in 1727, Daniel and Nicolaus Bernoulli, who had recently moved to St. Petersburg to join the newly established St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, helped secure a position for their brilliant former student.[^24] Euler moved to Russia that same year, initially joining the academy's medical-physiological section, as no mathematics position was immediately available.[^25] However, this arrangement proved temporary; in 1730, Euler was promoted to professor of physics, and by 1733, when Daniel Bernoulli returned to Basel, Euler succeeded him as the senior chair of mathematics at the age of just twenty-six.[^26]

During his first St. Petersburg period (1727-1741), Euler established himself as a mathematician of extraordinary productivity and breadth.[^27] He immersed himself in every area of mathematics known at the time, while also contributing significantly to physics, astronomy, and engineering.[^28] In 1734, Euler married Katharina Gsell, daughter of Georg Gsell, a Swiss painter working at the Russian court.[^29] The couple would have thirteen children together, though tragically only five survived to adulthood—a harsh reminder of the medical realities of the 18th century.[^30]

A pivotal moment in Euler's life occurred in 1735 when he suffered a near-fatal fever that resulted in the loss of sight in his right eye.[^31] Despite this setback, his productivity continued unabated. That same year, Euler solved a problem that had baffled mathematicians for decades: the Basel problem, which asked for the precise sum of the reciprocals of the squares of all positive integers.[^32] His elegant solution, showing that this infinite series equals π²/6, demonstrated both his analytical brilliance and his ability to connect disparate areas of mathematics.[^33]

In 1741, Euler accepted an invitation from Frederick the Great to join the Berlin Academy of Sciences in Prussia, beginning his Berlin period (1741-1766).[^34] Frederick sought to establish Berlin as an intellectual center to rival Paris and London, and Euler's presence added immense prestige to the academy.[^35] During his twenty-five years in Berlin, Euler served as director of mathematics and published over 380 works while also advising the government on practical matters including artillery, cartography, finances, and even the construction of water fountains at Frederick's summer palace.[^36]

## Major Achievements

Leonhard Euler's contributions to mathematics were so vast and fundamental that they touch virtually every area of the discipline, establishing frameworks and notations that remain standard today.[^37] It has been estimated that Euler authored approximately one quarter of the combined output in mathematics, physics, mechanics, astronomy, and navigation during the entire 18th century—an achievement almost incomprehensible in its scope.[^38]

Perhaps Euler's most visible legacy lies in mathematical notation, where he introduced or popularized symbols and conventions that have become universally adopted.[^39] He introduced the modern notation f(x) to describe a function, fundamentally changing how mathematicians conceptualize and communicate about mathematical relationships.[^40] Euler was the first to use the letter *e* to represent the base of natural logarithms (now known as Euler's number, approximately 2.71828), and he popularized the use of the Greek letter π to denote the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.[^41] He introduced the Greek letter Σ (sigma) for summations, the letter *i* to denote the imaginary unit (√−1), and standardized notation for trigonometric functions.[^42] He also established the convention of using lowercase letters *a*, *b*, and *c* for the sides of a triangle and uppercase *A*, *B*, and *C* for the opposite angles.[^43]

In number theory, Euler achieved breakthroughs that united previously disparate fields and created entirely new areas of study.[^44] He invented the totient function φ(n), which counts the positive integers less than *n* that are coprime to *n*, and used its properties to generalize Fermat's little theorem into what became known as Euler's theorem.[^45] More significantly, Euler pioneered the use of analytic methods to solve number theory problems, thereby uniting analysis and number theory and founding the field of analytic number theory.[^46] He made substantial progress toward what would later become the prime number theorem and conjectured the law of quadratic reciprocity, both considered fundamental theorems of number theory.[^47] His work in this area paved the way for Carl Friedrich Gauss's later achievements.[^48]

Euler's contributions to calculus and mathematical analysis were equally transformative.[^49] He formalized the concept of a mathematical function and introduced the systematic use of exponential functions and logarithms in analytic proofs.[^50] His two monumental textbooks, *Institutiones calculi differentialis* (1755) and *Institutiones calculi integralis* (1768-1770), remained standard references for mathematicians well into the 19th century and are still consulted today.[^51] Euler developed the calculus of variations, solved numerous differential equations, and introduced the Euler-Mascheroni constant (γ), which appears throughout analysis and number theory.[^52]

In topology and graph theory, Euler founded entire disciplines with single brilliant insights.[^53] In 1736, he solved the famous problem of the Seven Bridges of Königsberg, which asked whether one could walk through the city crossing each of its seven bridges exactly once.[^54] Euler proved this impossible and, in doing so, created graph theory and laid groundwork for topology—the study of properties preserved under continuous deformations.[^55] His solution abstracted the problem into a network of nodes and edges, demonstrating a revolutionary approach to mathematical thinking.[^56]

Euler also made fundamental contributions to applied mathematics, physics, and astronomy.[^57] He reformulated Newton's laws of motion in terms that applied to rigid bodies, developed the Euler equations describing fluid flow, and advanced the wave theory of light in opposition to Newton's corpuscular theory (though ironically borrowing heavily from Newton's *Principia* for his wave propagation ideas).[^58] In astronomy, he worked extensively on the three-body problem and lunar motion theory, publishing partial solutions in 1753 and a complete theory in 1772, even while completely blind.[^59]

His formula *e*^(iπ) + 1 = 0, known as Euler's identity, has been called "the most beautiful equation in mathematics" as it elegantly connects five fundamental mathematical constants: *e*, *i*, π, 1, and 0.[^60] From 1725 to 1783, Euler averaged 800 pages of published work per year, an output that remained unmatched in the history of mathematics.[^61] He also wrote over 4,500 letters and hundreds of manuscripts, many of which continued to be published for decades after his death.[^62]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many historical figures, Leonhard Euler's life and work generated remarkably little personal controversy or scandal.[^63] His reputation remained largely unblemished throughout his life and after his death, with criticisms focusing almost exclusively on methodological rather than personal or ethical issues.[^64] The primary criticism of Euler's mathematical work concerns the standards of rigor by which he conducted his proofs—a criticism that must be understood within the context of 18th-century mathematics.[^65]

Modern mathematicians recognize that some of Euler's proofs would not meet contemporary standards of mathematical rigor.[^66] He often relied on intuitive leaps, manipulated infinite series without concern for convergence, and employed infinitesimals in ways that lacked formal justification until the 19th-century development of real analysis.[^67] For instance, Euler freely operated with divergent series and made arguments based on the properties of infinitely small quantities that later mathematicians would find insufficiently rigorous.[^68] His famous statement about infinitesimals—"To those who ask what the infinitely small quantity in mathematics is, I answer that it is actually zero"—reveals an approach that, while intuitive, lacked the formal ε-δ definitions that Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Karl Weierstrass would later establish.[^69]

However, historians of mathematics emphasize that Euler's "lack of rigor" by modern standards represented the norm for his era, not a personal failing.[^70] The standards of mathematical proof evolved significantly in the century after Euler's death, particularly through the work of Cauchy, Weierstrass, and others who formalized analysis.[^71] More importantly, despite occasional lapses in rigor, Euler's mathematical intuition proved extraordinarily reliable—his results, even when reached through questionable methods, were almost invariably correct.[^72] As mathematical historian Carl Boyer noted, Euler's ideas were responsible for many great advances, suggesting that his insights transcended the formal limitations of his proofs.[^73]

Another area where Euler faced criticism during his lifetime involved his physics rather than mathematics.[^74] Euler became the leading 18th-century critic of Isaac Newton's corpuscular (particle) theory of light, developing instead an alternative wave theory.[^75] This put him in an anti-Newtonian position on a major scientific question, which drew criticism from Newton's defenders.[^76] Paradoxically, Euler's wave theory of light borrowed heavily from principles Newton had established in Book II of the *Principia*, meaning Euler was simultaneously criticizing and building upon Newtonian physics.[^77] While history ultimately vindicated the wave theory of light (at least until quantum mechanics complicated the picture), Euler faced skepticism during his lifetime for opposing the great Newton.[^78]

Some contemporaries found Euler's extraordinary productivity itself a source of mild controversy.[^79] His relentless publication rate and willingness to work on practical engineering problems alongside pure mathematics led some to question whether he was spreading himself too thin or diluting the prestige of mathematics by applying it to mundane problems.[^80] However, this criticism never gained significant traction, and most recognized that Euler's breadth reflected genius rather than superficiality.[^81]

Unlike many court-affiliated scholars of his era, Euler avoided political intrigue and personal feuds that plagued figures like Voltaire (who clashed with Frederick the Great) or the priority disputes that consumed Newton and Leibniz.[^82] His personal life was notably scandal-free, characterized by devotion to his family and his work.[^83] The absence of significant controversy in Euler's biography stands as remarkable given the contentious intellectual environment of 18th-century European academies, where personalities frequently clashed and priority disputes were common.[^84]

## Personal Life

Leonhard Euler's personal life was characterized by domesticity, religious devotion, and an extraordinary ability to maintain mathematical productivity despite family chaos and personal hardship.[^85] In 1734, at the age of twenty-seven, Euler married Katharina Gsell, daughter of Georg Gsell, a Swiss painter working at the Russian court.[^86] The couple's marriage proved both prolific and tragic in ways typical of 18th-century life: Katharina bore thirteen children, but only five survived to adulthood.[^87] The high infant mortality rate that claimed eight of Euler's children was a harsh reality of the pre-modern medical era, though this knowledge likely provided little comfort to grieving parents.[^88]

Despite the sorrows of child loss, Euler was by all accounts a devoted and engaged father.[^89] Remarkably, he often conducted his mathematical work while children played around him, demonstrating an almost superhuman ability to concentrate amidst noise and distraction.[^90] Colleagues and visitors to the Euler household frequently commented on his ability to hold a baby in his arms while simultaneously solving complex mathematical problems or composing papers.[^91] This domestic scene—the great mathematician working at a table surrounded by the chaos of family life—became one of the enduring images of Euler's character.[^92]

Euler's religious faith remained strong throughout his life, reflecting his upbringing as the son of a Calvinist pastor.[^93] He was a devout Christian who saw no conflict between his mathematical work and his religious beliefs.[^94] Unlike some Enlightenment intellectuals who embraced skepticism or deism, Euler maintained traditional Christian orthodoxy, and he reportedly engaged in defending Christian doctrine in the Russian court.[^95] One famous anecdote, possibly apocryphal but widely repeated, tells of Euler at the court of Catherine the Great challenging the French philosopher Denis Diderot with a spurious mathematical "proof" of God's existence, supposedly declaring: "Sir, (a+b^n)/n = x, hence God exists—reply!"[^96]

The defining personal challenge of Euler's life was his progressive loss of vision.[^97] In 1738, he suffered a severe fever that resulted in the loss of sight in his right eye, leaving him partially blind for nearly three decades.[^98] Then, in 1766, a cataract was discovered in his left eye.[^99] An operation to couch the cataract temporarily improved his vision, but complications soon rendered him almost totally blind in that eye as well, leaving him with at best light perception.[^100] For the final seventeen years of his life, Euler was essentially completely blind.[^101]

Rather than ending his career, Euler's blindness seemed to liberate his productivity.[^102] Upon losing sight in his first eye years earlier, he had reportedly remarked, "Now I will have fewer distractions."[^103] Living up to this declaration, Euler's output actually increased during his years of blindness.[^104] With the aid of scribes—including his sons Johann Albrecht and Christoph—Euler dictated his work, relying on his phenomenal memory to perform complex calculations mentally.[^105] In 1775, while completely blind, he produced on average one mathematical paper per week.[^106]

After Katharina's death in 1773, Euler remarried in 1776, taking as his second wife Salome Abigail Gsell, his first wife's half-sister.[^107] This remarriage ensured that Euler maintained family support and companionship during his final years.[^108] On September 18, 1783, Euler spent the afternoon discussing the newly discovered planet Uranus and its orbit with the astronomer Anders Johan Lexell after lunch with his family.[^109] While engaged in these calculations and conversation, he suddenly collapsed from a brain hemorrhage.[^110] According to the mathematician and eulogist Marquis de Condorcet, Euler "ceased to calculate and to live."[^111] He was seventy-six years old and had remained intellectually active until the final moments of his life.[^112]

## Legacy

Leonhard Euler's legacy pervades modern mathematics, physics, and engineering to such an extent that imagining these fields without his contributions is nearly impossible.[^113] He is universally recognized as among the most prolific and influential mathematicians in history—arguably *the* most prolific, with a publication record that remains unmatched.[^114] The sheer volume of his work required the establishment of a dedicated editorial project, the *Opera Omnia Leonhardi Euleri*, which began publication in 1911 and continues to this day, having produced over seventy volumes encompassing his 866 published works and vast correspondence.[^115]

Euler's influence on mathematical notation alone ensures his permanent place in the discipline's history.[^116] Modern students and researchers use Euler's symbols—*e*, *i*, π, Σ, and f(x)—without necessarily realizing they are employing notation he introduced or popularized.[^117] As historian of mathematics Florian Cajori observed, Euler's notational innovations did for modern mathematics what standardized notation did for chemistry: they created a universal language enabling rapid communication and development.[^118] The adoption of Euler's notation across languages and national boundaries demonstrates mathematics' transformation into a truly universal discipline during the 18th century, with Euler as chief architect of this transformation.[^119]

In pure mathematics, Euler's foundational work established entire fields that flourish today.[^120] Graph theory, which Euler invented with his solution to the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, now underlies computer science, network analysis, and operations research.[^121] Topology, another field Euler pioneered, became central to 20th-century mathematics through its connections to geometry, analysis, and even physics.[^122] His work in number theory laid groundwork that Gauss, Riemann, and subsequent generations built upon, leading ultimately to modern cryptography and computer science.[^123]

The impact of Euler's work extends far beyond abstract mathematics into practical applications.[^124] His contributions to fluid mechanics—particularly the Euler equations describing ideal fluid flow—remain fundamental to aerodynamics, weather prediction, and engineering.[^125] Engineers use Euler's methods in structural analysis, control theory, and signal processing.[^126] Physicists employ Eulerian mechanics in classical dynamics, and his work on the calculus of variations underlies quantum mechanics and general relativity.[^127] Modern technologies from GPS satellites to quantum computers rest on mathematical foundations Euler helped establish.[^128]

Great mathematicians who followed Euler recognized their debt to him explicitly.[^129] Pierre-Simon Laplace, one of the supreme mathematicians of the generation after Euler, advised students: "Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all."[^130] Carl Friedrich Gauss, often ranked alongside or above Euler in mathematical genius, wrote: "The study of Euler's works will remain the best school for the different fields of mathematics, and nothing else can replace it."[^131] This reverence persisted throughout the 19th and 20th centuries; mathematician André Weil noted that Euler's work anticipated developments in mathematics that wouldn't be fully appreciated until the 20th century.[^132]

Euler's productivity and his ability to maintain it despite blindness became legendary, inspiring mathematicians facing their own obstacles.[^133] His example demonstrated that mathematical creativity resided primarily in the mind rather than the eyes or hands.[^134] The image of the blind Euler dictating groundbreaking mathematics to his scribes became a powerful symbol of intellectual perseverance and the triumph of mind over physical limitation.[^135]

Modern assessments of Euler's significance have only grown with time.[^136] Mathematicians recognize that while Newton and Leibniz invented calculus, Euler made it into a practical tool with systematic methods and notation.[^137] While others contributed to number theory, Euler created analytic number theory as a distinct discipline.[^138] In breadth of contribution across mathematics, physics, astronomy, and engineering, Euler stands virtually alone in having fundamentally shaped multiple entire fields.[^139] As historian Ronald Calinger concluded, Euler "did for modern analytic geometry and trigonometry what Euclid's Elements had done for ancient geometry," establishing the standard framework that endures to this day.[^140]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historical assessments of Leonhard Euler have been overwhelmingly positive, with mathematicians, historians, and scientists offering praise that borders on the superlative.[^141] Scholars recognize Euler not merely as a great mathematician but as a transformative figure whose work fundamentally reshaped the discipline.[^142] The mathematician Clifford Truesdell described Euler as "the most productive mathematician who ever lived," emphasizing both the quantity and quality of his output.[^143] This combination of volume and excellence distinguishes Euler even among the pantheon of mathematical giants.[^144]

Mathematicians particularly emphasize Euler's role in transforming mathematics from a collection of problem-solving techniques into a unified, systematic discipline with standardized notation and methods.[^145] Historian of mathematics Carl Boyer wrote that Euler "did for mathematics what Bach did for music: he brought existing forms to perfection and created new forms of enduring value."[^146] This comparison captures how Euler both mastered and transcended the mathematical traditions he inherited, establishing frameworks that future generations would inhabit.[^147]

Modern scholars appreciate aspects of Euler's work that his contemporaries may have undervalued.[^148] Mathematician William Dunham, in his book *Euler: The Master of Us All*, argues that Euler's genius lay not just in solving difficult problems but in asking the right questions and developing systematic approaches.[^149] Euler's textbooks became models of mathematical exposition, demonstrating how to think about problems rather than merely listing solutions.[^150] His *Introductio in analysin infinitorum* (1748), for instance, became the template for how analysis should be taught, influencing mathematical pedagogy for over a century.[^151]

Contemporary mathematicians recognize Euler's remarkable foresight in pursuing topics that seemed peripheral in the 18th century but became central later.[^152] His work on infinite series, special functions, and what would become complex analysis anticipated developments that mathematicians wouldn't fully appreciate until the 19th and even 20th centuries.[^153] Mathematician André Weil noted that "Euler's versatility was such that important papers of his lay forgotten for years, only to be rediscovered by later mathematicians who thought they were finding something new."[^154]

Scholars also celebrate Euler's character alongside his intellectual achievements.[^155] Unlike the contentious personalities of some great mathematicians, Euler was noted for generosity, modesty, and willingness to acknowledge others' contributions.[^156] He maintained friendly relations with most contemporary mathematicians and helped younger scholars develop their careers.[^157] Historian of science Rupert Hall described Euler as "the ideal type of the disinterested scholar," motivated purely by love of mathematics rather than personal aggrandizement.[^158] This combination of intellectual brilliance and personal virtue makes Euler particularly admirable to biographers and historians.[^159]

### Negative Views

Criticism of Leonhard Euler remains remarkably sparse compared to most historical figures of comparable significance, but scholars have identified limitations in his work and approach.[^160] The primary criticism concerns mathematical rigor, a point already discussed but worth examining from critics' perspectives.[^161] Some 19th-century mathematicians, having developed more rigorous foundations for analysis, viewed Euler's free manipulation of infinite series and infinitesimals as exemplifying the lax standards of earlier mathematics.[^162] The Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, while acknowledging Euler's genius, complained that "Euler introduced into mathematics a scandalous want of rigor," though Abel was criticizing the era's standards rather than Euler personally.[^163]

Certain modern historians of mathematics have questioned whether Euler's extraordinary productivity came at the expense of depth in some areas.[^164] With publications spanning mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and even theology and philosophy, critics wonder whether Euler occasionally sacrificed thoroughness for breadth.[^165] Some of his astronomical and physical theories proved less enduring than his purely mathematical work, suggesting possible overextension.[^166] However, defenders counter that even Euler's "minor" contributions often exceeded what most mathematicians achieve in lifetimes devoted to single specialties.[^167]

A few scholars have criticized Euler's pedagogical choices in his textbooks, arguing that his systematic, formal approach sometimes obscured the intuitive insights that led to discoveries.[^168] While his texts became standard references, some students found them difficult precisely because Euler presented results in polished, final form without showing the exploratory process behind them.[^169] Mathematician George Pólya suggested that Euler's books, while excellent as references, didn't always serve as optimal teaching tools because they concealed the heuristic reasoning that makes mathematics accessible.[^170]

From a historiographic perspective, some modern scholars critique the "great man" narrative that centers on Euler while potentially obscuring the collaborative nature of 18th-century mathematical development.[^171] While Euler undoubtedly made extraordinary individual contributions, he also benefited from and built upon a mathematical community including the Bernoulli family, Lagrange, d'Alembert, and others.[^172] Focusing exclusively on Euler's achievements risks minimizing this collaborative context.[^173]

Some historians of science have noted that Euler's opposition to Newton's theory of light, while ultimately somewhat vindicated by wave theory, was based partly on incorrect physical reasoning.[^174] His wave theory incorporated flawed ideas about the medium of light propagation and made predictions that didn't align with experimental results available in his time.[^175] This suggests that even Euler's genius had limits when venturing into areas where mathematical elegance didn't guarantee physical accuracy.[^176]

Nevertheless, even these criticisms are relatively gentle, often acknowledging that they reflect changing standards or represent minor blemishes on an overwhelmingly positive record.[^177] No serious scholar questions Euler's fundamental importance or suggests his contributions were anything less than revolutionary.[^178] The relative absence of substantial criticism itself constitutes a form of historical assessment: Euler's work was so solid, his character so unblemished, and his influence so pervasive that critics struggle to find significant faults.[^179]
