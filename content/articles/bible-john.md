## Summary
Bible John is the pseudonym of an unidentified serial killer who murdered three women after meeting them at the Barrowland Ballroom in Glasgow between 1968-69. The case remains unsolved.

## Why the case is notable
- The attacker was never identified despite a large investigation and extensive publicity.
- The crimes are closely associated with a specific venue and time period in Glasgow nightlife.
- The nickname “Bible John” reflects a distinctive reported conversational style (religious references) that helped witnesses remember him.

## Known victims (as publicly reported)
The canonical “Bible John” series refers to three women who were killed after nights out at (or connected to) the Barrowland Ballroom.

- Patricia Docker (murdered 1968)
- Jemima McDonald (murdered 1969)
- Helen Puttock (murdered 1969)

## Modus operandi / pattern (high level)
Reports about the case commonly describe a consistent pattern:

- The perpetrator met women in a social setting connected to the Barrowland Ballroom.
- Victims were later found murdered, indicating they left the venue area with the attacker.
- Witness descriptions suggested a well-presented man who could converse confidently.
- The “Bible John” moniker comes from accounts that he quoted or referenced the Bible in conversation.

(Details beyond these broad points vary across secondary sources and are not always independently verifiable.)

## Investigation overview
- The case prompted a major police investigation, including extensive interviewing of witnesses.
- The killer remained unidentified; the investigation continued for decades as new techniques and leads emerged.
- As with many historical cases from this era, the availability and preservation of forensic evidence can constrain later re-analysis.

## Suspects and later speculation
Over time, various individuals have been proposed by authors and commentators.

- Some claims have linked the case to other offenders, but such links are typically speculative unless confirmed by police.
- A frequently mentioned example in modern media is Peter Tobin; these claims are debated and are not a definitive identification.

## Cultural impact
- The case became one of Scotland’s best-known unresolved murder investigations.
- The nickname “Bible John” entered popular discussion of unsolved crimes, especially in Glasgow-related true crime coverage.
