## Summary

Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540-1596) was an English explorer, naval officer, and privateer who became the first captain to circumnavigate the globe in a single expedition (1577-1580), bringing unprecedented wealth to England and earning a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth I.[^1] A controversial figure, Drake was celebrated in England as a naval hero who played a crucial role in defeating the Spanish Armada in 1588, while the Spanish reviled him as a pirate and heretic.[^2] His legacy is deeply complex, encompassing remarkable achievements in navigation and naval warfare alongside participation in the slave trade and brutal military actions in Ireland.[^3] Drake rose from modest origins as the son of a Protestant farmer to become one of the wealthiest and most influential men in Elizabethan England, serving as Mayor of Plymouth and Member of Parliament.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Francis Drake was born circa 1540-1543 in Tavistock, Devonshire, England, on the Crowndale estate of Lord Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford.[^5] He was the eldest of twelve sons born to Edmund Drake (1518-1585), a Protestant farmer and lay preacher, and his wife, Mary Mylwaye.[^6] The exact date of Drake's birth remains uncertain due to conflicting evidence from portraits and contemporary records. A miniature by Nicholas Hilliard painted in 1581 when Drake was allegedly 42 would place his birth around 1539, while another portrait from 1594 suggesting he was 52 years old would indicate a birth year of approximately 1541.[^7]

Drake's childhood was marked by religious upheaval and economic hardship. In 1549, when Francis was still a young boy, the family was forced to flee Devonshire for Kent because of dangerous anti-Protestant sentiment during the Catholic reaction of the Prayer Book Rebellion.[^8] The family's poverty was severe, and they lived in the hulk of a ship on the River Medway, where Edmund Drake served as a preacher to the sailors.[^9] This early exposure to ships and maritime life would prove formative for the young Francis.

At an early age, Drake was placed into the household of a relative, sea-captain William Hawkins of Plymouth, and began his seagoing training as an apprentice on Hawkins' boats.[^10] By age 18, he had become a purser, demonstrating his aptitude for maritime affairs.[^11] In the 1550s, Drake's father found the young man a position with the owner and master of a small barque trading to France and the Low Countries.[^12] Drake proved himself so capable that when the master died, he bequeathed the vessel to Drake, giving him his first command while still in his early twenties.[^13] This early sailing experience on smaller coastal trading vessels provided Drake with invaluable navigational skills and an intimate knowledge of seamanship that would serve him throughout his career.

Around age 18, Drake began sailing on the Hawkins family boats, gaining experience not only in legitimate trading but also in acts of piracy against French vessels, activities that required skill, bravery, ruthlessness, and what some historians have described as "a streak of cruelty."[^14] By 1566, when Drake was approximately 22 years old, he had proven himself sufficiently capable to obtain command of the Judith, one of the ships in a fleet commanded by his relative John Hawkins.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Drake's ascent to prominence began with his involvement in the slave trade and privateering expeditions to the Spanish Main. His first significant voyage was likely with John Lovell's fleet in 1566-67, during which the Englishmen enslaved approximately 300 people in Sierra Leone and transported them to Venezuela and Colombia for sale.[^16] In 1567, Drake accompanied John Hawkins on a major slaving expedition that would prove to be a turning point in his career and his relationship with Spain.

The 1567-68 Hawkins expedition involved the capture of approximately 400-500 enslaved Africans through various means, including allying with local kings in Sierra Leone who requested help against their enemies in exchange for half of any captives taken.[^17] The expedition also attacked Portuguese trading ships operating between Cabo Verde and Sierra Leone, and by January 1568, the fleet had taken one hundred and fifty slaves.[^18] However, this voyage ended in disaster at San Juan de Ulúa in Mexico, where Spanish forces attacked the English fleet, destroying most of the ships and killing many men.[^19] Drake escaped in the Judith, but the betrayal and loss at San Juan de Ulúa created a lasting hatred of Spain that would fuel his later raids.

Between 1570 and 1573, Drake made several voyages to the West Indies and Central America, gradually building his reputation and wealth through raids on Spanish settlements and shipping.[^20] In 1572-1573, Drake led his most ambitious expedition yet, exploring Panama and successfully seizing a Spanish silver mule train carrying treasure from Peru to the Caribbean coast.[^21] This raid was spectacularly successful, and Drake returned to England with enough Spanish gold and silver to make him a wealthy man and establish his reputation as a formidable naval commander.[^22]

The expedition that would transform Drake from a successful privateer into a national hero began on December 13, 1577, when he departed Plymouth with five ships on what was ostensibly a trading voyage to the Nile.[^23] In reality, Queen Elizabeth I had secretly commissioned Drake to raid Spanish settlements and shipping along the Pacific coast of the Americas, an area the Spanish considered their exclusive domain.[^24] The voyage faced immediate challenges, including storms, conflicts among the crew, and the controversial trial and execution of Thomas Doughty for mutiny at Puerto San Julián in June 1578.[^25]

Drake became the first Englishman to navigate the Straits of Magellan, though he lost most of his fleet to storms in the Pacific.[^26] Continuing northward along the western coast of South America with only his flagship, the Golden Hind, Drake raided numerous Spanish ports that were virtually undefended on the Pacific side, as the Spanish had never anticipated attacks from that direction.[^27] His greatest prize came in March 1579, when he captured the Spanish treasure ship Nuestra Señora de la Concepción (nicknamed Cacafuego), liberating from it a dozen chests of coins, 80 pounds of gold, and 26 tons of silver.[^28]

## Major Achievements

Francis Drake's circumnavigation of the globe (1577-1580) stands as one of the most remarkable achievements in the history of exploration. Drake completed the second circumnavigation of the world in a single expedition, and became the first captain to sail his ship around the world, as Ferdinand Magellan had died during his expedition before its completion.[^29] The voyage lasted nearly three years and covered approximately 36,000 miles, demonstrating not only Drake's exceptional navigational skills but also his ability to maintain crew discipline and morale during extended periods at sea.[^30]

On June 17, 1579, during the circumnavigation, Drake and his crew landed at what is now known as Drake's Bay in Northern California, where they spent 36 days repairing the Golden Hind, establishing contact with local Indigenous peoples, and exploring the region.[^31] Drake claimed the area for Queen Elizabeth I, naming it New Albion after the white cliffs that reminded him of England's White Cliffs of Dover.[^32] This represented the first overseas territorial claim executed during Elizabeth I's reign, though it would not lead to immediate English colonization.[^33] Drake then crossed the Pacific, stopping in the Moluccas (Spice Islands) to take on a cargo of valuable spices, before completing the journey across the Indian Ocean and around the Cape of Good Hope.[^34]

When the Golden Hind sailed into Plymouth on September 26, 1580, it carried Drake, 59 surviving crew members, and a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures whose value was almost beyond calculation.[^35] The treasure included some twenty-six tons of silver, half a ton of gold, thousands of coins, and numerous pieces of jewelry and jewels, emanating mainly from Peru and Bolivia.[^36] The spoils were so immense that it took over a week to unload, and the value was sufficient to clear England's entire national debt.[^37] The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the Crown's income for that entire year, amounting to at least £160,000.[^38] For investors, the return was extraordinary: more than £47 for every £1 invested, or 4,700%.[^39]

On April 4, 1581, Queen Elizabeth I boarded the Golden Hind at Deptford and knighted Drake on its decks, with the dubbing ceremonially performed by the French diplomat Monsieur de Marchaumont to maintain diplomatic deniability with Spain.[^40] This knighthood was a reward for Drake's circumnavigation, his plundering of Spanish ports and ships, his territorial claim of New Albion for England, and most importantly, his delivery of vast treasure to his Queen.[^41] Drake was hailed as a national hero, and his voyage demonstrated England's naval prowess and potential for global exploration, dealing a significant blow to Spanish dominance and bolstering England's position in the emerging global economy.[^42]

Following his circumnavigation, Drake continued his naval career with distinction. Between 1585 and 1587, he attacked Spanish vessels and ports in the Spanish Main, further disrupting Spain's colonial operations.[^43] In April 1587, Drake executed what became known as "singeing the King of Spain's beard" – a daring raid on the harbor at Cádiz in southern Spain, where he destroyed ships and supplies, ultimately forcing the Spanish Armada to delay sailing for an entire year.[^44] This preemptive strike demonstrated Drake's strategic thinking and boldness in taking the fight directly to Spanish waters.

Drake's most celebrated military achievement came in July and August 1588, when he served as second in command under Lord Howard of Effingham during the defeat of the Spanish Armada.[^45] Throughout the week and a half of confused naval maneuvers and battles, Drake was in the thick of the conflict.[^46] He captured the Rosario, the flagship of the Andalusian division, with General Pedro de Valdés aboard, after it collided with another ship and was disabled.[^47] On the night of August 7, Drake was instrumental in the fireship attack at Calais, sending eight small ships packed with inflammables into the anchored Spanish fleet, forcing them to cut their anchors and leave port in disarray.[^48] The following day, at the Battle of Gravelines off the coast of France, superior English guns under the command of Howard and Drake won a decisive victory, and the devastated Armada was forced to retreat north to Scotland and attempt the perilous journey home around Scotland and Ireland.[^49]

Drake's political career also flourished during the 1580s and 1590s. He served as Mayor of Plymouth from 1581-82, and was elected Member of Parliament for Camelford in 1581, Bossiney in 1584, and Plymouth in 1593.[^50] During his parliamentary service, he was active on committees concerned with privileges and returns, recusants, fish, the poor law, Plymouth harbour, fresh water to Stonehouse, wounded soldiers, and naval cordage, demonstrating engagement with issues affecting Devon and the navy.[^51] In 1581, after his knighthood, Drake purchased Buckland Abbey, a thirteenth-century monastery that had been the home of the Grenville family for the previous forty years, establishing himself as a significant landowner in Devonshire.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his celebrated achievements, Francis Drake's career was marked by numerous controversies and actions that modern historians recognize as deeply problematic. Drake was one of the first English slave traders, participating in at least two major slaving voyages that resulted in the enslavement and transportation of hundreds of Africans.[^53] While some sources suggest Drake's attitude to slavery may have changed in later years – he reportedly refused an offer of a woman off the coast of Mauritania, saying he would not deal in "which sort of merchandise" – his earlier participation in the trade remains an indelible stain on his legacy.[^54]

The most notorious atrocity associated with Drake occurred on July 26, 1575, at Rathlin Island off the coast of Ireland, where more than 600 Scots and Irish, retainers of the MacDonnells of Antrim, were killed by English Crown forces under the command of Drake and John Norreys.[^55] Acting on instructions from Sir Henry Sidney and Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex, Drake used two cannons to batter the castle, and when the walls gave in, Norreys ordered a direct attack on July 25; the garrison surrendered under terms that promised safe passage to the constable and his family.[^56] Despite this surrender, they killed all 200 defenders and, on July 26, 1575, Norreys' forces hunted down more than 400 civilian men, women, and children who were hiding in caves, killing them all.[^57] The entire family of Sorley Boy MacDonnell perished in the massacre, and Essex boasted in a letter to Francis Walsingham that MacDonnell watched the massacre from the mainland helplessly and was "like to run mad from sorrow."[^58] This slaughter of mainly women, children, and the elderly seeking refuge has been described as "the Srebrenica of its day in Ireland," and would today be deemed a war crime.[^59]

The trial and execution of Thomas Doughty during the circumnavigation voyage remains one of the most controversial episodes of Drake's career. Thomas Doughty (1545-1578) was an English nobleman, soldier, scholar, and personal secretary of Christopher Hatton who sailed with Drake on the 1577 voyage.[^60] When the fleet arrived at Puerto San Julián in Patagonia on June 20, 1578, Drake charged Doughty with mutiny and treason.[^61] The most damning evidence included testimony that Doughty had disclosed the true purpose of their voyage to William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley; a jury of crewmen convicted Doughty of mutiny only, rejecting the charge of treason.[^62] When Doughty demanded that Drake show his commission from the Queen allowing him such jurisdiction, Drake refused, and when lawyer Leonard Vicary objected that "This is not lawe nor agriable to justice," Drake responded, "I have not...to do with you crafty lawyars, neythar care I for the lawe, but I know what I wyll do."[^63] Doughty was beheaded on July 2, 1578, after sharing communion and dining cheerfully with Drake the evening before.[^64] Most historians consider Doughty's trial to have been a sham, and Thomas Doughty's brother John attempted to indict Drake for murder in the Earl Marshall's Court upon their return to England, though Drake never actually stood trial as some hand, perhaps the Queen's, stayed the proceedings.[^65]

The Spanish viewed Drake not as an explorer or naval hero but as an illegal trader of enslaved people and a ruthless pirate.[^66] His raids on Spanish colonial settlements and shipping violated international norms of the time, as England and Spain were not officially at war during much of Drake's privateering career.[^67] Spanish colonists lived in terror of "El Draque," and his depredations contributed to the deteriorating relationship between England and Spain that eventually erupted into open warfare.[^68]

Modern reassessment of Drake's legacy has led to controversy over public monuments honoring him. Calls were made for Drake's statues in Plymouth and Tavistock to be removed after protesters toppled Edward Colston's statue in Bristol, with critics arguing that too often in the United Kingdom, Drake is presented as an unqualified hero with his role in the slave trade glossed over or unmentioned.[^69] There are numerous public monuments to Drake and his contemporaries' achievements, but no public monuments to the thousands of Africans killed and enslaved by them.[^70] Drake's figure serves as a lightning rod for intense debate over the ethical dimensions of colonialism and the transatlantic slave trade.[^71]

## Personal Life

Francis Drake married Mary Newman at St. Budeaux church near Plymouth on July 4, 1569.[^72] Mary was the daughter of a prosperous Plymouth merchant, and the marriage aligned Drake with an established local family as his wealth and status were beginning to grow.[^73] Drake lived with Mary Newman for fourteen years, though much of this time was spent at sea on his various expeditions.[^74] There had been rumors that Mary had been attached to another man, Thomas Doughty – Drake's friend and later rival – while Drake was missing during his circumnavigation, but as soon as she learned her husband was alive, that relationship ended.[^75] Mary Drake died around January 24, 1583, perhaps of smallpox, aged just 30.[^76]

In 1585, two years after Mary's death, Drake married Elizabeth Sydenham, born around 1562, the only child of Sir George Sydenham of Combe Sydenham, who was the High Sheriff of Somerset.[^77] Elizabeth was twenty years younger than Drake and came from a wealthy family, of which she was an heiress, bringing additional land and status to Drake's already considerable holdings.[^78] Elizabeth outlived Drake by many years and never remarried, preserving his memory and managing his estates after his death.[^79]

Despite marrying twice, Drake had no children, a source of personal disappointment that affected his legacy plans.[^80] Drake's personal life was filled with death – not only his two wives but many companions and crew members perished during his voyages. He amassed considerable wealth that he left to his nephew Francis, who was named after him, ensuring the family name and fortune would continue.[^81] Drake was one of twelve children, and his brother Thomas accompanied him on voyages and also named his son after the famous explorer.[^82]

Contemporary accounts describe Drake as a man of medium height with a reddish beard and a commanding presence.[^83] He was known for his charisma and ability to inspire loyalty among his men, though he could also be ruthless when he perceived threats to his authority or mission.[^84] Drake was deeply Protestant in his religious convictions, a faith shaped by his father's persecution and the family's flight from Devonshire during his childhood.[^85] This religious conviction intensified his antagonism toward Catholic Spain and provided moral justification, in his own mind and that of his Protestant contemporaries, for his raids on Spanish possessions.[^86]

Drake was also known for his love of music and ceremony at sea, maintaining a consort of musicians aboard his flagship and insisting on formal dinners with fine tableware, even during long ocean voyages.[^87] This attention to maintaining civilized standards was part of his strategy for maintaining morale and discipline during extended expeditions far from home.[^88] He was meticulous about record-keeping and navigation, maintaining detailed journals and charts that contributed to English knowledge of global geography.[^89]

## Legacy

Francis Drake's legacy is profoundly ambiguous, embodying both the adventurous spirit of the Elizabethan age and its darker aspects of colonial violence and exploitation. In England, Drake has been celebrated for centuries as a national hero who expanded English power and challenged Spanish dominance of the seas.[^90] His circumnavigation demonstrated that English sailors could match and exceed the achievements of Spanish and Portuguese explorers, opening new possibilities for English trade and colonization.[^91] The defeat of the Spanish Armada, in which Drake played a crucial role, is remembered as one of the most important moments in English history, preserving Protestant England from Catholic invasion and establishing England as a major naval power.[^92]

Drake's influence on English naval tradition was immense. Two common scholarly traditions concerning Drake's life and contributions have emerged: the older tradition, found in Julian Corbett's biography "Drake and the Tudor Navy" (1898), identifies Drake as the single most important figure in the founding and triumph of the British navy, while an alternative approach locates Drake squarely within the context of privateering.[^93] The first tradition has tended to laud only his successes, while the second approach, which emphasizes his flaws and failures, has sometimes been equally one-sided.[^94] According to scholar Peter Whitfield, scholarship on Drake has moved "from the hero worship of the Victorians to the cold iconoclasm" of the twenty-first century.[^95]

Thomas Cavendish, directly influenced by Drake's voyage, set out in 1586 and completed his own circumnavigation by 1588, demonstrating how Drake's achievement inspired further English exploration.[^96] Drake's navigational achievements, particularly his successful passage through the Straits of Magellan and his exploration of the Pacific coast of North America, contributed significantly to geographic knowledge and opened new routes for English shipping.[^97]

In Spain and Latin America, Drake's legacy is entirely different. He is remembered as "El Draque" – a pirate and heretic who terrorized Spanish settlements, stole treasure, and disrupted colonial commerce.[^98] Spanish accounts portray Drake not as a heroic explorer but as a criminal who violated the laws of nations and engaged in unprovoked attacks on peaceful settlements.[^99] This divergent memory reflects the fundamental conflict between Protestant England and Catholic Spain that defined much of the sixteenth century.[^100]

Drake's participation in the slave trade and his role in atrocities such as the Rathlin Island massacre have become increasingly central to assessments of his legacy in recent decades. Historians now acknowledge that figures such as Drake are not simplistic characters; they can be different things, at different points of time, to different people.[^101] He can be viewed simultaneously as a privateer and an admiral, an explorer and a pirate, a hero and a war criminal.[^102] Modern historians recognize the complexities of Drake's legacy, acknowledging the controversies surrounding his actions while also recognizing his enduring influence as a pioneering explorer and naval commander.[^103]

The geographic legacy of Drake's voyages remains visible today. Drake's Bay in California, Drake Passage between South America and Antarctica, and numerous other place names commemorate his journeys.[^104] On October 6, 2021, the California State Parks director designated Francis Drake's 1579 California landing site at Point Reyes as California Historical Landmark number 1061, though the exact location of his landing remains subject to scholarly debate.[^105]

Drake's wealth and the treasure he brought to England had lasting economic impact. The influx of Spanish gold and silver helped finance Elizabeth I's government and contributed to England's economic development, though it also fueled inflation and contributed to the growing conflict with Spain.[^106] The example Drake set – that privateering and exploration could bring enormous wealth – inspired generations of English sailors and adventurers, contributing to England's eventual development of a global empire.[^107]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Traditional English historiography has portrayed Drake as one of the greatest heroes of the Elizabethan age and a key architect of English naval supremacy. Julian Corbett's influential 1898 biography "Drake and the Tudor Navy" established a scholarly tradition that identifies Drake as the single most important figure in the founding and triumph of the British navy, crediting him with developing tactics and strategies that would define English naval warfare for generations.[^108] This perspective emphasizes Drake's courage, navigational genius, and service to his country during a period of existential threat from Spanish power.[^109]

Defenders of Drake's legacy point to his remarkable achievements in navigation and exploration. As the first captain to successfully circumnavigate the globe with his ship intact, Drake demonstrated extraordinary seamanship, leadership, and resilience.[^110] His ability to maintain crew discipline and morale during a voyage lasting nearly three years, facing storms, disease, and conflicts, speaks to exceptional leadership qualities.[^111] The successful passage through the Straits of Magellan, a feat that had defeated many previous navigators, demonstrated both courage and navigational skill.[^112]

Drake's role in defending England from the Spanish Armada is celebrated as genuinely heroic. His strategic foresight in attacking Cádiz in 1587 to disrupt Spanish preparations, and his tactical innovations during the 1588 battles, contributed significantly to England's survival as an independent Protestant nation.[^113] Without the defeat of the Armada, English history might have taken a dramatically different course, and Drake's contribution to this victory was substantial.[^114]

Scholarly supporters also note that Drake operated within the norms and expectations of his time. Privateering was a recognized practice in sixteenth-century naval warfare, and Drake's raids on Spanish shipping were conducted with the tacit approval, and sometimes explicit commission, of Queen Elizabeth I.[^115] His actions against Spain can be understood as part of a broader conflict between Protestant England and Catholic Spain, rather than simple piracy.[^116] The treasure Drake brought back to England helped finance the government and strengthen the nation during a critical period.[^117]

Some historians argue that evidence suggests Drake's views on slavery evolved over time, pointing to his reported refusal to trade in human beings later in his career and his generally good relations with indigenous peoples he encountered during his circumnavigation, particularly in California where accounts describe peaceful and respectful interactions.[^118] They also note that Drake was a product of his time, and judging sixteenth-century figures by twenty-first-century moral standards is historically problematic.[^119]

### Negative Views

Modern critical scholarship has increasingly emphasized the darker aspects of Drake's career, particularly his participation in the slave trade and his involvement in colonial violence. Critics argue that Drake was among the first English slave traders, directly participating in the capture, transportation, and sale of hundreds of African people, causing immeasurable suffering and contributing to the establishment of English involvement in the transatlantic slave trade.[^120] While his later reluctance to engage in slave trading may indicate some moral evolution, it does not erase his earlier actions.[^121]

The Rathlin Island massacre of 1575 is cited by critics as evidence of Drake's willingness to participate in war crimes. The deliberate killing of more than 400 women, children, and elderly people who had surrendered and were seeking refuge represents an atrocity that cannot be justified by the military standards of any era.[^122] That Drake carried out these orders without apparent hesitation or subsequent remorse reveals a capacity for cruelty that contradicts the heroic image.[^123]

Drake's execution of Thomas Doughty is viewed by many historians as a judicial murder rather than a legitimate trial. Drake's refusal to show his commission from the Queen, his dismissal of legal objections, and his declaration that he did not care for the law demonstrate an authoritarian approach that prioritized his personal authority over justice.[^124] The fact that Doughty's brother attempted to indict Drake for murder, and that Drake avoided trial only through powerful intervention, suggests that even contemporaries recognized the execution as problematic.[^125]

From the Spanish and Latin American perspective, Drake was unquestionably a pirate and terrorist who attacked peaceful settlements, stole treasure, and killed innocent people.[^126] His raids violated contemporary international law and norms governing warfare, as England and Spain were not officially at war during much of his privateering activity.[^127] The terror he inflicted on Spanish colonial populations – who lived in fear of "El Draque" – caused real suffering that is often overlooked in English heroic narratives.[^128]

Critical scholars argue that celebrating Drake as a hero while ignoring or minimizing his participation in slavery and colonial violence perpetuates harmful historical narratives. The fact that there are numerous public monuments to Drake and his contemporaries' achievements, but no public monuments to the thousands of Africans killed and enslaved by them, reflects a troubling imbalance in historical memory.[^129] As one scholar noted, "Too often in the UK, Drake is presented as an unqualified hero: the brave circumnavigator who saved England from the Spanish Armada; his role in the slave trade glossed over or unmentioned."[^130]

Recent scholarship has moved toward more nuanced assessments that refuse to portray Drake as either pure hero or pure villain. As historian Peter Whitfield observes, modern scholarship has evolved "from the hero worship of the Victorians to the cold iconoclasm" of the twenty-first century, seeking a more balanced understanding that acknowledges both achievements and atrocities.[^131] Drake can be viewed as both a privateer and an admiral, and figures such as Drake are not simplistic characters; they can be different things, at different points of time, to different people.[^132] This more complex view recognizes that Drake's legacy is therefore very ambiguous, embodying both the adventurous exploration and the violent exploitation that characterized the age of European colonial expansion.[^133]
