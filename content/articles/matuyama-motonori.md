## Summary

Matuyama Motonori was a Japanese geophysicist who provided the first evidence that Earth's magnetic field has reversed polarity in the past. By studying the magnetization of basalt rocks in Japan and Manchuria in the 1920s, he showed that some rocks were magnetized in the opposite direction to the current field. The Matuyama reversed polarity epoch is named after him.
