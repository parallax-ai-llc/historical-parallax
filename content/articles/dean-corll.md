## Summary
Dean Arnold Corll, the 'Candy Man,' was an American serial killer who, with teenage accomplices David Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley, abducted, raped, tortured, and murdered at least 28 boys in Houston, Texas between 1970 and 1973. He was shot dead by Henley, his own accomplice.

## Early Life
Born December 24, 1939, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. His family moved to Houston, where they operated a candy factory. Corll worked at the factory and gave candy to neighborhood children, earning his nickname. He served in the Army before returning to Houston. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1970 and 1973, Corll used teenage accomplices David Brooks and Elmer Wayne Henley to lure victims to his home with promises of parties, drugs, or rides. He tortured and sexually assaulted victims on a plywood 'torture board' before killing them. At least 28 victims were buried in a boat shed, on a beach, and at a lake near Houston. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
On August 8, 1973, Henley shot and killed Corll during an altercation at Corll's home. He then led police to the burial sites. The case revealed the largest serial murder case in U.S. history at that time. Brooks and Henley were convicted and sentenced to life. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- The case exposed the inadequacy of Houston PD's missing persons investigations [^4]
- Led to major reforms in how police handled cases of missing youths
- Prompted community awareness programs about child safety

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered at least 28 boys and young men [^5]
- Used teenage accomplices to recruit victims
- Subjected victims to prolonged torture and sexual assault
- Many victims were not reported missing or were dismissed as runaways
- Police failures allowed the killing spree to continue for three years
