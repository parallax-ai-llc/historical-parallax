## Summary

Henry Moseley was a British physicist whose work on X-ray spectra of elements established atomic number as a more fundamental property than atomic weight. His Moseley's law provided experimental evidence for the nuclear model of the atom and reorganized the periodic table. Had he not been killed at Gallipoli during World War I at age 27, he would almost certainly have received a Nobel Prize. His death led to policies protecting scientists from combat.
