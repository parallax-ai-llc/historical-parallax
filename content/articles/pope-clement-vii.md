## Summary

Pope Clement VII was Pope from 1523 to 1534 during one of the most turbulent periods in Church history. He faced the Sack of Rome by Imperial troops in 1527, the beginning of the Protestant Reformation, and Henry VIII's request for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. His refusal to grant the annulment led to the English Reformation and the break between England and Rome. He also commissioned Michelangelo's Last Judgment.
