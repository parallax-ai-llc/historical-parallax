## Summary

Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi was a 13th-century Persian poet, scholar, and Sufi mystic. His masterwork the Masnavi-yi Ma'navi is considered one of the greatest works of mystical literature ever composed. His transformative encounter with the dervish Shams-i-Tabrizi turned him from a conventional scholar into an ecstatic poet. He founded the Mevlevi Order famous for the whirling dervish ceremony. He is the best-selling poet in the United States.
