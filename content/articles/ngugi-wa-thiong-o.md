## Summary

Ngugi wa Thiong'o is a Kenyan writer who is one of the most important voices in African literature. After writing early novels in English including Weep Not, Child and A Grain of Wheat, he made the radical decision to write in Gikuyu rather than English. His imprisonment by the Kenyan government for his political theater made him an international cause celebre.
