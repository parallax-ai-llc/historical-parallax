## Summary

John Backus was an American computer scientist who led the team that developed FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level programming language. FORTRAN revolutionized programming by allowing scientists and engineers to write programs in a notation close to mathematical formulas instead of machine code. He also developed the Backus-Naur form (BNF) for describing programming language syntax. He received the Turing Award in 1977.
