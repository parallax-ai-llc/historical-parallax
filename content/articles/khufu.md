## Summary

Khufu, also known by his Greek name Cheops, was the second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of ancient Egypt, reigning from approximately 2589 to 2566 BCE. He is best known for commissioning the Great Pyramid of Giza, the largest and oldest of the three pyramids on the Giza plateau, which stood as the tallest human-made structure for over 3,800 years. His reign represents the zenith of Old Kingdom pyramid construction and demonstrates the extraordinary administrative and engineering capabilities of ancient Egypt. Despite his monumental achievements, Khufu's character remains controversial, with ancient Greek historians portraying him as a tyrant while Egyptian sources suggest he was honored as a wise ruler and even worshipped as a god after his death.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Khufu was born around 2609 BCE into the royal family of Egypt's Fourth Dynasty, an era that would become synonymous with the greatest achievements in pyramid construction.[^3] His full name, Khnum-khufwy, means "Khnum is my Protector," invoking the ancient Egyptian ram-headed god of creation.[^4] Khufu's lineage placed him at the center of Egyptian power: his father was Sneferu, the renowned founder of the Fourth Dynasty and builder of three major pyramids, while his mother was Queen Hetepheres I, daughter of Huni, the last pharaoh of the Third Dynasty.[^5][^6]

The marriage of Sneferu to Hetepheres I was politically significant, joining two great royal bloodlines and helping to solidify Sneferu's position as pharaoh of a new dynasty, as well as securing Khufu's place in the line of succession.[^7] However, some uncertainty surrounds Khufu's parentage. While Egyptologists generally accept Sneferu as his biological father based on later historical accounts stating that the eldest son or a selected descendant would inherit the throne, definitive proof remains elusive.[^8] In 1925, the tomb of Queen Hetepheres I was discovered east of Khufu's pyramid, containing precious grave goods and inscriptions giving her the title Mut-nesut (meaning "mother of a king"), together with the name of King Sneferu, providing strong evidence for the traditional genealogy.[^9]

Growing up in the royal court during his father's reign, Khufu would have witnessed the unprecedented ambition of Sneferu's building projects, including the Bent Pyramid and the Red Pyramid at Dahshur. This formative experience undoubtedly influenced his own architectural aspirations and understanding of the organizational capacity required to mobilize Egypt's resources for monumental construction. Sneferu's innovations in pyramid design and his association with the sun god Ra set important precedents that Khufu would build upon during his own reign.[^10] Khufu ascended to the throne in his twenties, inheriting not only political power but also a well-established administrative system and a kingdom at the height of its prosperity.[^11]

---

## Rise to Power

Khufu's succession to the throne around 2589 BCE appears to have been relatively smooth, suggesting a stable transfer of power from his father Sneferu.[^12] As the son of both the reigning pharaoh and a princess of the previous dynasty, Khufu's claim to the throne was unassailable by the standards of ancient Egyptian royal succession. The Fourth Dynasty during this period represented the apex of centralized royal authority, with the pharaoh wielding absolute power over the unified kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt.[^13]

Upon assuming power, Khufu inherited a kingdom that his father had strengthened through military campaigns, mining expeditions, and unprecedented building projects. Sneferu had established Egypt's dominance over Nubia to the south and had opened trade routes to Lebanon for cedar wood, to the Sinai for copper and turquoise, and across the Red Sea.[^14] This legacy provided Khufu with both the resources and the administrative framework necessary to undertake his own ambitious projects.

Early in his reign, Khufu appears to have consolidated his power by appointing trusted officials to key positions. His nephew Hemiunu, son of Prince Nefermaat and grandson of Sneferu, was appointed as vizier and royal seal bearer, becoming the highest civilian official in the kingdom.[^15][^16] Hemiunu would prove instrumental in managing the day-to-day administration of the kingdom and likely played a crucial role in overseeing the construction of the Great Pyramid. The practice of appointing members of the royal family to the position of vizier was standard during the Fourth Dynasty and early Fifth Dynasty, ensuring loyalty and maintaining power within the royal bloodline.[^17]

Khufu continued his father's religious innovations, particularly the association of the pharaoh with the sun god Ra. While Sneferu had been the first pharaoh to publicly identify himself with Ra, Khufu went further in this "solarization" of kingship.[^18] This religious positioning not only enhanced his divine status but also provided ideological justification for the massive resource mobilization required for his building projects. The Fourth Dynasty witnessed a significant shift in religious practices, as worship of the sun became increasingly central and the Cult of Ra grew in size and influence.[^19]

Within the first years of his reign, Khufu began planning what would become his greatest legacy: a pyramid that would surpass all previous monuments in scale and ambition. The decision to build at Giza, rather than continuing at his father's necropolis at Dahshur, represented both a practical choice—the Giza plateau offered excellent bedrock and proximity to limestone quarries—and a symbolic one, establishing Khufu's own monumental presence separate from his father's achievements.[^20]

---

## Major Achievements

### The Great Pyramid of Giza

Khufu's most extraordinary achievement was the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza, known in ancient times as Akhet-Khufu ("Horizon of Khufu").[^21] Built over approximately 26-27 years during his reign, the pyramid originally stood at 146.6 meters (481 feet), making it the world's tallest human-made structure for more than 3,800 years—a record that would stand until the construction of medieval European cathedrals.[^22][^23] The pyramid is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World and the only one that has remained largely intact.[^24]

The scale of the project was staggering. Approximately 2.3 million blocks of stone were cut, transported, and assembled to create the 5.75-million-ton structure.[^25] The construction required approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite imported from Aswan (over 800 kilometers away), and 500,000 tonnes of mortar.[^26] The precision of the construction demonstrates extraordinary engineering capability: the base, with sides more than 230 meters (750 feet) long, shows a maximum difference in length of only 4.4 centimeters (1¾ inches), and the base is level within 2.1 centimeters.[^27] The pyramid's sides rise at a precise angle of 51.87° and are accurately oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass.[^28]

The internal architecture of the pyramid displays remarkable sophistication. It contains a complex system of passages and chambers, including three main chambers: the unfinished subterranean chamber cut into the bedrock, the so-called Queen's Chamber, and the King's Chamber, which houses a red granite sarcophagus weighing approximately 3.75 tons.[^29][^30] The internal walls and the few remaining outer casing stones show finer joints than any other masonry constructed in ancient Egypt.[^31] The Grand Gallery, ascending to the King's Chamber, represents a masterpiece of corbelled architecture, while the relieving chambers above the King's Chamber demonstrate sophisticated understanding of structural engineering to protect the burial chamber from the immense weight above.[^32]

### Administrative and Organizational Innovation

Perhaps equally impressive as the pyramid itself was the administrative achievement required to organize the labor force, logistics, and resources. The discovery in 2013 of the Diary of Merer, papyrus fragments found at Wadi al-Jarf, provided unprecedented insight into the construction process.[^33] These papyri, the oldest known in the world, were written by a supervisor of limestone deliveries from the Tura quarries to Giza in the 27th year of Khufu's reign.[^34] They reveal a highly organized bureaucratic system coordinating the transport of materials via boat across the Nile and overland to the construction site.

Modern archaeological discoveries at workers' camps near Giza suggest that Khufu's administration organized thousands of workers into efficiently managed teams.[^35] The labor force appears to have consisted of rotating crews of peasant farmers from surrounding villages and provinces, organized into competing gangs with names such as "Friends of Khufu" and "Drunkards of Menkaure."[^36] Graffiti left by workers near the burial chamber proudly identifies their work crew as "The Friends of Khufu Gang," suggesting esprit de corps among the laborers.[^37]

### Economic Development and Foreign Trade

Khufu expanded Egypt's mining and trade operations significantly. He sent multiple expeditions to the Sinai Peninsula to extract copper and turquoise from the mines at Wadi Maghareh, where rock inscriptions depicting Khufu with the double crown have been found.[^38][^39] He also developed diorite quarries at Abu Simbel and maintained the important harbor at Wadi al-Jarf on the Red Sea, where ships brought precious materials from the southern Sinai.[^40] The discovery of this harbor and associated papyri revealed the oldest archaeologically detected sailing route in ancient Egyptian history.[^41]

Khufu maintained strong trade relations with Byblos in Lebanon, exchanging copper tools and weapons for precious Lebanon cedar wood, which was essential for building large, stable boats.[^42] Indeed, the famous Khufu ship, discovered in 1954 sealed in a pit beside the Great Pyramid, was constructed of Lebanese cedar.[^43] This vessel, 43.4 meters long and consisting of 1,224 pieces, represents the world's oldest intact ship and demonstrates both the importance of the Lebanon trade and the sophistication of ancient Egyptian shipbuilding.[^44][^45]

### Religious Innovation

Khufu contributed to the evolution of Egyptian royal theology by strengthening the association between the pharaoh and the sun god Ra. While his father Sneferu had initiated this connection, Khufu was described as "a sort of solarized king," and his son Djedefre would become the first king to formally use the title "Son of Ra" as part of his royal titulary.[^46][^47] This religious development would have lasting impact, as the solar theology increasingly merged with the concept of kingship throughout subsequent Egyptian history.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Herodotus's Portrait of a Tyrant

The most damaging portrayal of Khufu comes from the Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote approximately 2,000 years after Khufu's death. Herodotus depicted Khufu as a cruel tyrant who "brought the country into all sorts of misery" and "compelled them without exception to labour as slaves for his own advantage."[^48][^49] According to Herodotus, Khufu closed all the temples, forbade religious sacrifices, and forced the entire Egyptian population to work on building his pyramid.[^50] The Greek historian claimed that "the Egyptians can hardly bring themselves to mention him, so great is their hatred."[^51]

Perhaps most sensationally, Herodotus repeated accusations that Khufu, desperate for funds to complete his pyramid, prostituted his own daughter, instructing her to charge clients and raise money for the construction.[^52] This story, shocking even by ancient standards, has been widely rejected by modern scholars as fabrication or misunderstanding of Egyptian customs.

### Modern Scholarly Critique of Ancient Sources

Contemporary Egyptologists have raised fundamental objections to Herodotus's account. First, the timing issue is critical: Herodotus wrote his history around 440 BCE, approximately 2,000 years after Khufu's reign, and may have been recording oral traditions with no factual basis or simply his own speculations.[^53] Modern historians have been unable to find the sources Herodotus claimed to have consulted, and none of his allegations about Khufu and his daughter are supported by factual evidence.[^54]

Alan B. Lloyd and other scholars argue that overwhelmingly positive views of Khufu in contemporary Egyptian documents directly contradict the negative portrayals by Greek historians.[^55] Modern Egyptologists critique Herodotus's account as laced with exaggerations for dramatic appeal, likely influenced by priestly biases against Old Kingdom pharaohs or mistranslations of inscriptions.[^56] The ancient historians Manetho and Diodorus Siculus similarly handed down negative depictions of Khufu's character, though Manetho claimed Khufu was initially contemptuous of the gods but later repented and composed sacred books (which have never been found).[^57][^58]

### Archaeological Evidence Contradicts the "Tyrant" Image

Archaeological evidence from the workers' villages at Giza paints a very different picture from Herodotus's claims of brutal slavery. Excavations at Heit al-Ghurab reveal a state-supported labor force that was well-fed, provided with medical care, and given proper burials.[^59] Analysis of thousands of fish, bird, cattle, sheep, goat, and pig bones demonstrates that workers received substantial provisions, including poultry, fish, fruit, various breads, cakes, and beer.[^60] Workers even received dates and honey, delicacies that were extremely scarce and generally reserved for the royal entourage.[^61]

Medical examination of skeletal remains from worker burials reveals the physically demanding nature of the work—degenerative arthritis in the vertebral column and knees was common—but also shows evidence of medical care.[^62] Most fractures had healed completely with good realignment, indicating that broken bones had been set with splints and workers received competent medical treatment.[^63] Workers were not slaves but peasants conscripted on a rotating part-time basis, working under skilled artisans and craftsmen.[^64]

### The Debate Over Temple Closures

While Herodotus's claim that Khufu closed all temples lacks archaeological support, some scholars have speculated about possible religious tensions during his reign. The massive resource mobilization for pyramid construction would have required redirecting wealth and labor that might otherwise have supported temple institutions. However, the lack of contemporary Egyptian sources condemning Khufu, combined with evidence of his continued cult worship for millennia after his death, suggests that if such policies existed, they did not fundamentally alienate the priesthood or population.[^65]

### The Missing Body Mystery

A persistent controversy surrounds the fact that Khufu's mummy has never been found. Although a red granite sarcophagus rests in the King's Chamber deep within the Great Pyramid, it is empty, and archaeologists have never located the pharaoh's remains.[^66][^67] Diodorus Siculus referred to ancient legends claiming that Khufu was not buried in his pyramid, while medieval Arab historians mentioned a mummy-shaped coffin that supposedly held the king's body.[^68] Some researchers have theorized about undiscovered hidden chambers within the pyramid, though extensive exploration using modern technology has yet to reveal any major sealed chambers.[^69]

---

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Wives

Khufu was married to at least two wives, though sources suggest he may have had as many as four.[^70] His first and principal wife was Meritites I, who bore him several children including his heir apparent, Prince Kawab.[^71] Meritites held significant status in the royal court, and her position as mother of the crown prince gave her considerable influence. Khufu's second wife, Henutsen, is prominently mentioned on the Inventory Stela and was buried in one of the small pyramids beside the Great Pyramid.[^72] Two of his wives—Meritites and Henutsen—were interred in subsidiary pyramids adjacent to Khufu's own, a honor reflecting their importance.[^73]

The practice of royal polygamy served both dynastic and political purposes in ancient Egypt, allowing the pharaoh to form alliances with powerful families and ensure multiple lines of succession. The exact number of Khufu's wives remains uncertain, with some sources suggesting he had four marriages during his reign.[^74]

### Children and Family

The royal family of Khufu was quite large, reflecting the polygamous practices of Egyptian royalty.[^75] Various sources credit him with between nine and fifteen sons and six to fifteen daughters, with some accounts suggesting a total of twelve children from four different wives.[^76][^77] His children would play crucial roles in the subsequent history of the Fourth Dynasty.

Among his sons, the most prominent were:

**Prince Kawab**, son of Queen Meritites I, was designated as heir to the throne and held the position of crown prince.[^78] However, Kawab died before Khufu, never assuming kingship. Some ancient sources suggest that Kawab may have been murdered by one of his brothers, Djedefre, who sought the throne, though this remains speculative.[^79]

**Djedefre** (also spelled Radjedef) ultimately succeeded his father as pharaoh after Khufu's death. Djedefre's reign was relatively brief, lasting approximately eight years. He was responsible for his father's funeral and burial, as his cartouche was found on many blocks covering the boat pits beside the Great Pyramid.[^80] Djedefre was the first Egyptian king to formally adopt the title "Son of Ra," continuing his father's religious innovations.[^81]

**Khafre** (Chephren in Greek) followed Djedefre on the throne and built the second pyramid at Giza, nearly matching his father's monument in size. Khafre was the full brother of Khufukhaf and likely served as vizier late in Khufu's reign or during Khafre's own reign.[^82]

**Djedefhor** (also known as Hordjedef) gained fame as a wise man in ancient Egyptian tradition and is featured prominently in the Westcar Papyrus.[^83]

Among his daughters, **Hetepheres II** married Djedefre, continuing the royal lineage through intermarriage between siblings and half-siblings, a common practice in Egyptian royal families to maintain bloodline purity.[^84]

### Personality and Character

Reconstructing Khufu's personality from the historical record is challenging given the contradictory nature of the sources. Contemporary Egyptian evidence suggests a different character from the tyrant portrayed by later Greek historians. The Westcar Papyrus, an ancient Egyptian literary work from the Middle Kingdom (though set during Khufu's reign), depicts him in relatively benevolent terms as an easygoing but intellectually curious ruler who enjoyed listening to tales of magic and wonder told by his sons.[^85] In these stories, Khufu appears as an interested patron seeking entertainment and marvels, even summoning the magician Dedi to perform feats of magic at court.[^86]

The evidence of worker organization and treatment suggests a pharaoh capable of inspiring loyalty and organizing complex endeavors rather than ruling through pure terror. The fact that workers' graffiti proudly proclaimed their gang names and association with Khufu's project implies a degree of worker pride and identification with the royal enterprise.[^87]

## Legacy

### The Enduring Monument

The Great Pyramid of Giza stands as Khufu's most enduring legacy, dominating both the physical landscape of Egypt and the historical imagination of subsequent civilizations.[^88] Originally standing at approximately 147 meters, it held the record as the world's tallest structure for over 3,800 years, an achievement unmatched in human architectural history.[^89] The pyramid is the largest in Giza and the world, representing the zenith of ancient Egyptian pyramid construction.[^90] Through the millennia, it has inspired awe, speculation, and countless theories about its construction methods and supposed hidden purposes.

### The Mortuary Cult and Religious Legacy

Following his death around 2566 BCE, a vast mortuary cult developed at Khufu's necropolis to maintain offerings and perform rituals ensuring his continued existence in the afterlife.[^91] The extent and longevity of this cult demonstrate Khufu's lasting significance in Egyptian religious life. Remarkably, worship at his cult center continued for millennia—inscriptions and archaeological evidence confirm the cult was still actively followed during the 26th Dynasty, approximately 2,000 years after his death, and even into the Late Period and Roman Period.[^92][^93] Khufu's extensive mortuary cult, with numerous priests and high officials, contributed to the economic stability and prosperity of his necropolis, ensuring the continuation of his legacy through perpetual veneration.[^94]

This posthumous worship directly contradicts Herodotus's claims that Egyptians hated Khufu and refused to speak his name. Instead, the evidence suggests that Egyptians honored Khufu as a god centuries and even millennia after his reign.[^95] This paradox—remembered by later Egyptians as a wise ruler worthy of divine honors, yet portrayed by Greek historians as a despised tyrant—reflects the complex and sometimes contradictory nature of historical memory.

### Influence on Subsequent Rulers

Khufu's association with the sun god Ra had lasting impact on Egyptian royal ideology. His strengthening of the connection between pharaonic power and solar worship set a template that his successors would follow and expand.[^96] His son Djedefre formalized this connection by becoming the first king to use "Son of Ra" as an official royal title, an innovation that would become standard for all subsequent pharaohs.[^97]

The model of the pyramid complex that Khufu perfected—with pyramid, mortuary temple, causeway, valley temple, and subsidiary pyramids—became the standard template for royal burials throughout the Old Kingdom.[^98] His successors, including his sons Djedefre and Khafre, as well as later pharaohs, would attempt to emulate or surpass his achievement, though none would match the Great Pyramid in sheer scale.

### Economic and Territorial Impact

Khufu's development of mining operations in the Sinai, maintenance of trade routes to Lebanon, and establishment of Red Sea ports created infrastructure and commercial relationships that benefited Egypt for generations.[^99] The administrative systems developed to manage the pyramid construction—including labor organization, resource allocation, logistics, and record-keeping—demonstrated capabilities that strengthened centralized royal authority and bureaucratic efficiency.[^100]

The occurrence of Khufu's name on monuments ranging from Nubia to Sinai and beyond provides indication of Egypt's power and influence during his reign, suggesting a reach that extended well beyond the Nile Valley.[^101] His accomplishments contributed to the consolidation of ancient Egyptian civilization and inspired future generations of builders and administrators.[^102]

### Cultural Memory

The contradictory nature of Khufu's historical reputation itself became part of his legacy. The Egyptians remembered Khufu with a complex mixture of reverence and ambivalence—honored as a god yet also recalled as a stern ruler.[^103] This duality persisted through Egyptian history and into Greek and Roman accounts, creating a multifaceted historical figure who embodied both the grandeur and the cost of monumental ambition.

The Great Pyramid's status as the sole survivor of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World ensured that Khufu's name would remain known to every subsequent civilization that valued monumental architecture and engineering achievement. Through his pyramid, Khufu achieved a form of immortality that exceeded even ancient Egyptian religious conceptions of the afterlife—his name and achievement have been remembered continuously for over 4,500 years, making him one of the most enduringly famous individuals in human history.[^104]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern Egyptologists have increasingly emphasized Khufu's administrative and organizational genius rather than focusing on the ancient Greek narratives of tyranny. Contemporary scholars recognize that the construction of the Great Pyramid required not brutal coercion but sophisticated bureaucratic organization, efficient resource management, and the ability to mobilize and sustain a large workforce over decades.[^105] Archaeological evidence has reshaped reconstructions of Khufu's personality, shifting focus from the despot of legend to a capable administrator overseeing a complex state apparatus.[^106]

Excavations at the Giza workers' village by Ancient Egypt Research Associates and other teams have revealed organized communities of skilled laborers who were fed bread, beer, and meat—provisions far exceeding subsistence levels—rather than enslaved masses toiling under the whip.[^107] This evidence suggests voluntary participation or corvée labor (a form of taxation through labor service) under efficient bureaucratic control, rather than the slavery described by Herodotus.[^108]

Scholars like Alan B. Lloyd argue that contemporary Egyptian documents present overwhelmingly positive views of Khufu, creating a stark contradiction with later Greek portrayals.[^109] The fact that Khufu's mortuary cult continued for two millennia indicates that he was venerated rather than reviled by his own people.[^110] His posthumous reputation in Egypt as a wise ruler, as evidenced both by archaeological remains of his cult and by literary sources like the Westcar Papyrus, suggests that later characterizations as a tyrant reflect Greek misunderstandings or biases rather than historical reality.[^111]

Some scholars have even suggested that the negative Greek portrayals may stem from priestly hostility toward the Old Kingdom pharaohs' centralization of power and resources, which could have diminished temple autonomy and wealth.[^112] Alternatively, the stories may represent dramatic embellishments by Greek authors seeking to create entertaining narratives about exotic Egypt rather than accurate historical accounts.

The Diary of Merer and other papyri discoveries demonstrate a highly literate and organized administration capable of coordinating complex logistics, maintaining detailed records, and managing supply chains across hundreds of kilometers.[^113] This level of administrative sophistication reflects well on Khufu's governance and the capabilities of the officials he appointed.

Contemporary Egyptologists approach Khufu's depictions with critical methodology, striving to differentiate historical facts from later embellishments and myths by analyzing archaeological evidence, inscriptions, and papyri.[^114] This evidence-based approach has produced a more balanced and favorable assessment of Khufu as an effective ruler who presided over one of ancient Egypt's most prosperous and culturally productive periods.

### Negative Views

Despite archaeological evidence suggesting better treatment of workers than ancient accounts describe, some scholars maintain that the construction of the Great Pyramid necessarily involved significant human cost and suffering. The skeletal evidence of degenerative arthritis and frequent injuries among workers, even with medical treatment, indicates that the labor was extraordinarily physically demanding.[^115] Critics argue that regardless of whether workers were technically slaves or corvée laborers, the practical distinction may have been minimal for individual workers compelled to leave their homes and families for extended periods to perform backbreaking labor.

The concentration of such vast resources on a single monument—a tomb for one individual—raises ethical questions about priorities and the distribution of wealth in ancient Egyptian society. The limestone, granite, labor, and organizational capacity devoted to Khufu's pyramid represented an enormous expenditure that could theoretically have been directed toward other purposes benefiting the broader population. This criticism, while anachronistic in applying modern values to ancient societies, reflects ongoing scholarly debate about the social costs of monumental architecture.

Some scholars have suggested that even if Herodotus's specific allegations are exaggerated or false, his sources may have preserved genuine Egyptian folk memories of resentment toward the Fourth Dynasty pharaohs and their massive building projects.[^116] The closure of temples, while not archaeologically verified, remains plausible as a policy that would have freed up resources for pyramid construction, potentially creating genuine grievances among the priesthood and religiously observant population.[^117]

The contradictory depiction of Khufu remains the subject of great dispute between Egyptologists and historians, with some maintaining that the persistence of negative characterizations across multiple ancient sources (Herodotus, Manetho, Diodorus) suggests some historical basis for the unflattering portrayal, even if specific details are unreliable.[^118]

The mystery of Khufu's missing mummy and the empty sarcophagus in the King's Chamber has led some to speculate about ancient tomb robbery or possibly that Khufu was never actually buried in his pyramid, which could support ancient legends that he was denied proper burial—potentially as divine retribution, as some ancient sources claimed.[^119]

Critics also note the inherent violence of absolute monarchy and the concentration of power in a single individual, regardless of how benevolently that power might be exercised. The very ability to mobilize an entire kingdom's resources for a personal monument reflects the fundamental inequality of ancient Egyptian society, with the pharaoh's will taking absolute precedence over individual liberties or democratic decision-making—though such criticism again applies modern political values to a society where divine kingship was the accepted foundation of social order.
