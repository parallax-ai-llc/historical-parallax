## Summary

Sahachiro Hata was a Japanese bacteriologist who, working with Paul Ehrlich in Germany, discovered Salvarsan (arsphenamine), the first effective treatment for syphilis, in 1909. He tested hundreds of organoarsenic compounds before finding compound 606, which became the most prescribed drug in the world. This was the birth of chemotherapy.
