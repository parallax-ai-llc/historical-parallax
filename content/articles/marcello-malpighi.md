## Summary

Marcello Malpighi is considered the father of microscopical anatomy and histology. Using early microscopes, he discovered capillaries (completing Harvey's circulatory theory), described the microanatomy of the lungs, kidneys, spleen, and liver, and studied silkworm anatomy. His work established the use of the microscope in biological and medical research.
