## Summary

Frederick Griffith was a British bacteriologist who discovered bacterial transformation, the process by which bacteria can incorporate genetic material from their environment. His 1928 Griffith experiment showed that a non-virulent strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae could be transformed into a virulent strain, demonstrating that genetic information could be transferred between bacteria. This experiment led to the eventual identification of DNA as the genetic material.
