## Summary

Alexander III of Macedon (356-323 BC), known as Alexander the Great, was one of history's most successful military commanders who created one of the largest empires of the ancient world by age 30. In just 13 years of conquest, he remained undefeated in battle, founding over 20 cities bearing his name, spreading Greek culture across three continents, and fundamentally changing the course of world history. His empire stretched from Greece to northwestern India, encompassing approximately 2 million square miles at its peak.
