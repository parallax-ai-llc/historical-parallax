## Summary

Paul Ehrlich was a German physician and scientist who won the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to immunology. He is known as the father of chemotherapy for developing Salvarsan, the first effective treatment for syphilis. He pioneered the concept of a 'magic bullet' — a drug that selectively targets disease-causing organisms without harming the body. His work on staining techniques, serology, and immunology was foundational.
