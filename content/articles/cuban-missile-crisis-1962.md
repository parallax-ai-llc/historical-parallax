## Overview
The Cuban Missile Crisis was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale nuclear war. It began when U.S. spy planes discovered Soviet nuclear missiles being built in Cuba.

## Resolution
After tense negotiations, the crisis ended with the Soviets dismantling their weapons in Cuba in exchange for a U.S. pledge not to invade Cuba and a secret agreement to remove U.S. missiles from Turkey.
