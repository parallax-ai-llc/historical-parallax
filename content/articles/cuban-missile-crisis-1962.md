## Overview

The Cuban Missile Crisis (October 16-28, 1962) was the closest humanity came to nuclear war during the Cold War. When American reconnaissance discovered Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, just 90 miles from Florida, a tense 13-day standoff ensued between the United States and the Soviet Union. President John F. Kennedy and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev navigated a crisis that could have killed hundreds of millions. The resolution through secret diplomacy rather than military action became a turning point in Cold War relations.

## Background

### Cold War Context

**Nuclear Arms Race:**
By 1962, both superpowers possessed thermonuclear weapons capable of destroying civilization.

**Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD):**
Both sides knew nuclear war meant mutual annihilation.

**U.S. Missiles in Europe:**
Jupiter missiles deployed in Turkey and Italy, within striking distance of USSR.

### Cuba and Castro

**Cuban Revolution (1959):**
Fidel Castro overthrew U.S.-backed Batista regime. Cuba allied with USSR.

**Bay of Pigs (April 1961):**
CIA-backed invasion by Cuban exiles failed disastrously. Humiliated Kennedy; alarmed Castro and Soviets about future U.S. invasion.

**Soviet-Cuban Alliance:**
Khrushchev saw opportunity to:
- Protect socialist Cuba
- Counter U.S. missiles in Turkey
- Gain strategic advantage

---

## Soviet Deployment

### Operation Anadyr

**Secret Plan:**
Khrushchev approved deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba (May 1962).

**Weapons:**
- 42 medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs)
- 24 intermediate-range missiles (IRBMs)
- Nuclear warheads
- IL-28 bombers (nuclear-capable)
- 42,000 Soviet troops
- SAM (surface-to-air missile) sites

**Strategic Impact:**
Missiles could hit most major U.S. cities. Changed nuclear balance.

## Discovery

### October 14, 1962

**U-2 Reconnaissance:**
Major Richard Heyser's U-2 spy plane photographed missile sites under construction in San Cristóbal, Cuba.

### October 16: Kennedy Informed

Photo analysts confirmed SS-4 medium-range missiles. Kennedy convened secret Executive Committee (ExComm).

## The Thirteen Days

### ExComm Deliberations (October 16-22)

**Options Debated:**

**1. Air Strike:**
Destroy missiles. Risk: Soviet retaliation, killing Soviet personnel.

**2. Invasion:**
Full-scale attack on Cuba. Risk: High casualties, possible nuclear response.

**3. Blockade ("Quarantine"):**
Naval blockade to prevent more missiles. Less provocative but uncertain.

**4. Diplomacy:**
Negotiate. Risk: Appear weak; missiles become operational.

**Decision:**
Kennedy chose naval "quarantine" (blockade was technically act of war).

### October 22: Kennedy's Address

**7 PM Television Address:**
Kennedy revealed crisis to American public:
- Missiles in Cuba
- Naval quarantine imposed
- Demand: Remove missiles
- Warning: Attack from Cuba = attack from USSR

**Global Reaction:**
World held breath. U.S. forces went to DEFCON 2 (highest peacetime alert).

### Naval Quarantine (October 24)

**180 Ships:**
U.S. Navy encircled Cuba.

**Soviet Ships:**
Cargo vessels with more missiles approaching.

**Critical Moment:**
Soviet ships stopped, then turned back. Secretary of State Dean Rusk: "We're eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fellow just blinked."

### Dangerous Days (October 25-27)

**Tensions Mount:**
- Missiles in Cuba becoming operational
- Soviet submarines with nuclear torpedoes nearby
- U-2 shot down over Cuba (October 27); pilot Rudolf Anderson killed
- Another U-2 strayed into Soviet airspace
- Castro urged Khrushchev to launch preemptive strike

**Black Saturday (October 27):**
Crisis peak. Nuclear war seemed imminent.

## Resolution

### Khrushchev's Letters

**First Letter (October 26):**
Emotional, rambling. Proposed: Remove missiles if U.S. pledges not to invade Cuba.

**Second Letter (October 27):**
More formal. Added demand: U.S. remove Jupiter missiles from Turkey.

### Kennedy's Response

**Attorney General's Suggestion:**
Robert Kennedy proposed responding only to first letter, ignoring second.

**Secret Deal:**
Robert Kennedy met Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin:
- U.S. would publicly pledge not to invade Cuba
- U.S. would secretly remove Turkey missiles (6 months later)
- Soviets would remove Cuban missiles

### October 28: Crisis Ends

Khrushchev announced Soviet missiles would be withdrawn. World exhaled.

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate Effects

- Missiles removed (verified by November)
- Jupiter missiles removed from Turkey (1963)
- U.S. pledged not to invade Cuba (Castro remained in power until 2008)

### Long-Term Consequences

**Hotline:**
Direct Moscow-Washington communication line established (1963).

**Nuclear Arms Control:**
- Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963)
- Beginning of détente process

**Lesson:**
Brinkmanship nearly caused annihilation. Both sides sobered.

## What We Didn't Know Then

### Soviet Tactical Nukes

Unknown to U.S.: Soviets had tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba with local authorization to use if invaded. U.S. invasion would likely have triggered nuclear war.

### Submarine Incident

Soviet submarine B-59, depth-charged by U.S. Navy, nearly launched nuclear torpedo. One officer (Vasili Arkhipov) refused consent, preventing launch.
