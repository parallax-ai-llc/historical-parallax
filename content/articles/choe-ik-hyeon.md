## Summary

Choe Ik-hyeon (최익현; 崔益鉉; 1833–1907) was a Korean Joseon Dynasty Neo-Confucian scholar, politician, philosopher, and general who became one of Korea's most prominent anti-Japanese resistance leaders in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, he passed the civil service examination in 1855 and served as a government official before dedicating his life to defending Korean sovereignty against Japanese imperialism. A devoted student of the conservative scholar Yi Hang-no, Choe led opposition to the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876, organized anti-Japanese movements for nearly three decades, and at age 73 personally commanded a 400-strong Righteous Army against Japanese forces in 1906. After his capture, he was exiled to Tsushima Island where he died conducting a hunger strike, refusing to eat food provided by his captors, becoming a martyr for Korean independence.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Choe Ik-hyeon was born on December 5, 1833 (lunar calendar), in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, during the reign of King Sunjo of the Joseon Dynasty.[^3] He was born into the yangban (aristocratic) class during a period when Korea remained relatively isolated from the rapidly modernizing world, maintaining strict adherence to Neo-Confucian principles that had governed Korean society for centuries. Little is documented about his immediate family members, including his parents and siblings, though his yangban status afforded him access to classical education from an early age.[^4]

Choe received a rigorous traditional education in the Confucian classics, immersing himself in the study of ancient Chinese texts, Korean history, and Neo-Confucian philosophy. His intellectual formation was profoundly shaped by the teachings of Yi Hang-no (1792-1868), one of the most influential conservative Neo-Confucian scholars of the 19th century.[^5] Yi Hang-no was a prominent advocate of the Wijeong Cheoksa (衛正斥邪) ideology—literally "defending orthodoxy and resisting heterodoxy"—which maintained that traditional Neo-Confucian principles represented the moral foundation of Korean civilization and must be protected against corrupting foreign influences, particularly Western thought and Christianity.[^6]

Under Yi Hang-no's tutelage, Choe developed a worldview that considered Neo-Confucian Principle (li) as the fundamental substance of the universe and the basis for proper moral and political order. This education instilled in him a deep conviction that Korea's traditional values represented not merely cultural preference but universal moral truth that must be defended at all costs.[^7] In 1855, at the age of 22, Choe successfully passed the gwageo, the highly competitive civil service examination that served as the gateway to government service in the Joseon Dynasty.[^8] This achievement demonstrated both his intellectual capabilities and his mastery of classical learning, opening the door to an official career under King Cheoljong of Joseon, the 25th monarch of the dynasty.

Choe began his government service as an administrator in various offices, gaining experience in the bureaucratic workings of the Joseon state. He served for over twenty years in different capacities, eventually rising to become a fifth-ranked official, a significant achievement in the rigidly hierarchical Joseon bureaucracy.[^9] Throughout his official career, Choe demonstrated not only administrative competence but also a keen awareness of international affairs. Unlike many conservative scholars who remained ignorant of global developments, Choe understood the predatory nature of 19th-century imperialism and how direct capital investment by great powers into colonial economies proved fatal to those nations' economic independence.[^10] This understanding would later inform his vigorous opposition to opening Korea to foreign trade and influence.

## Rise to Prominence

Choe Ik-hyeon's transformation from government official to prominent nationalist opposition leader occurred in 1876, a watershed year in Korean history. When King Gojong contemplated signing the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1876 (also known as the Treaty of Ganghwa), he assembled his trusted advisers to solicit their counsel on this momentous decision.[^11] The proposed treaty would force Korea to open three ports to Japanese trade, grant extraterritorial rights to Japanese citizens, and effectively end Korea's centuries-long policy of international isolation—a policy that conservatives viewed as essential to preserving Korean cultural and political independence.

Choe emerged as the leader of conservative gentry opposition to the treaty, presenting a memorial to the throne that articulated five fundamental reasons why Korea should refuse to sign such an agreement with Japan.[^12] He argued passionately that the treaty would prove disastrous for Korea, predicting with remarkable accuracy that it would lead to the influx of Western thought, including Catholicism (which Confucian scholars viewed as heterodox and destabilizing), and enable the economic invasion of Korean markets by Japanese goods.[^13] Choe's opposition was not merely xenophobic but reflected a sophisticated understanding that Korea lacked the diplomatic initiative in these negotiations and that the treaty would serve as a gateway for foreign domination rather than genuine reciprocal trade.

Despite Choe's eloquent opposition and the protests of other conservative officials, King Gojong ultimately signed the treaty on February 26, 1876, under considerable pressure from Japanese military forces that had engaged in gunboat diplomacy, bombarding Korean fortifications at Ganghwa Island.[^14] The signing represented a crushing defeat for Choe and the conservative faction. As a direct consequence of his outspoken opposition and his criticism of the monarchy's capitulation, Choe was removed from office by pro-Japanese elements shortly after the treaty's ratification.[^15]

Rather than retreating into private life, Choe's banishment from government service liberated him to become a full-time activist and ideological leader. The treaty's signing and his subsequent dismissal galvanized Choe to re-initiate traditional Uijong Jeoksa (Wijeong Cheoksa) movements among the Korean people, working to revive Confucian values and mobilize resistance against Western and Japanese ideas.[^16] From 1876 to 1894, Choe, along with other conservative yangban scholars who had studied under Yi Hang-no, initiated systematic anti-Japanese movements across the country with the dual purpose of expelling all foreign influences and reinstating traditional Confucian values as the foundation of Korean society.[^17]

These movements were not merely intellectual or cultural but often took violent forms, as Choe and his followers considered the Japanese "no better than the western barbarians."[^18] Through his tireless organizing, writing, and public advocacy, Choe became recognized throughout Korea as the preeminent voice of conservative, nationalist opposition to foreign encroachment. His moral authority derived not only from his scholarly credentials and former government service but from his willingness to sacrifice his career and personal comfort for principles he held sacred. By the 1890s, Choe had established himself as the ideological leader of Korea's anti-foreign, anti-modernization movement, commanding respect and loyalty from conservative scholars, yangban aristocrats, and common people who feared the erosion of traditional Korean identity.

## Major Achievements

Choe Ik-hyeon's most significant achievements lay not in building institutions or accumulating power but in his unwavering moral resistance to Japanese imperialism and his role in inspiring and organizing armed opposition to foreign domination. His career represents a sustained three-decade campaign to preserve Korean sovereignty and cultural identity in the face of overwhelming external pressure.

Following his removal from office in 1876, Choe dedicated himself to building a nationwide network of anti-Japanese resistance. He traveled extensively throughout Korea, delivering speeches, writing memorials and treatises, and organizing conservative scholars and local communities to resist foreign influence.[^19] His efforts bore fruit in the proliferation of Wijeong Cheoksa study groups, educational initiatives emphasizing traditional Korean values, and local resistance movements that challenged pro-Japanese policies. Choe's influence extended beyond the yangban elite to include common people who were mobilized by his passionate defense of Korean identity.

A critical turning point came in 1895 following two traumatic events that shocked the Korean nation. First, Japanese agents brutally assassinated Queen Min (Empress Myeongseong) on October 8, 1895, in the Gyeongbok Palace.[^20] The murder of Korea's queen by foreign forces represented an unprecedented violation of Korean sovereignty and dignity. Second, in the aftermath of the assassination, Japanese-backed Gabo Reformers forced King Gojong to issue the "Short Hair Act," an edict decreeing that all Korean males must cut their topknot (sangtu), the traditional hairstyle that had symbolized Korean masculine identity and Confucian values for centuries.[^21]

Choe's response to the haircut edict exemplified his uncompromising stance. He famously declared that he "would rather cut off his head before cutting his hair," articulating what millions of Koreans felt—that the forced cutting of the topknot represented not mere fashion but an assault on Korean identity itself.[^22] This declaration galvanized nationwide resistance and established Choe as the symbolic leader of those who refused to capitulate to Japanese-imposed reforms.

Most significantly, Choe and his conservative colleagues transformed rhetorical opposition into armed resistance by organizing and leading the Righteous Army (Uibyeong or 의병), guerrilla forces composed of yangban scholars, former government officials, and commoners who took up arms to defend Korea.[^23] These irregular military forces operated throughout the Korean countryside, attacking Japanese soldiers, Japanese merchants, and Korean collaborators known as Chinilpa (친일파; pro-Japanese faction).[^24] The Righteous Army movement represented a dramatic departure from the traditional Confucian scholar's role, demonstrating that even elderly scholars were willing to abandon their books and take up weapons when their nation faced existential threat.

In the wake of the Japan-Korea Treaty of 1905 (Eulsa Treaty), which stripped Korea of its diplomatic sovereignty and made it a protectorate of Japan, the 72-year-old Choe sent an impassioned letter to Emperor Gojong (Gojong had declared Korea an empire in 1897) pleading with him to resist Japanese incursions and to refuse recognition of the treaty.[^25] When his appeals to the emperor proved ineffective, Choe took the extraordinary step of writing "An Appeal to Arms" (창의소; 倡義疏), a declaration addressed directly to the Korean people calling upon them to take up weapons against the Japanese invasion and to revitalize the spirit of the Righteous Army.[^26]

Choe's "Appeal to Arms" stands as one of the most important documents in Korean resistance literature. In it, he articulated a vision of Korean nationalism rooted in Confucian values, argued that passive acceptance of Japanese domination would mean the death of Korean civilization, and called for active, armed resistance as a moral imperative. The document circulated widely throughout Korea and inspired thousands to join resistance movements.

## Military Campaign and Martyrdom

At the age of 73, in 1906, Choe Ik-hyeon demonstrated that his calls for armed resistance were not merely rhetorical by personally taking command of a Righteous Army force. He raised an army of approximately 400 supporters in collaboration with fellow resistance leaders Im Byeong-chan and Im Nak-joo in Taein County (태인), Jeollabuk-do Province.[^27] This represented an extraordinary act for a elderly Confucian scholar; traditionally, yangban literati served as advisors and administrators rather than military commanders, but Choe personally led his forces into battle against Japanese troops.

The military campaign began with initial engagements in Taein, where Choe's forces attacked Japanese soldiers and pro-Japanese Korean officials.[^28] The Righteous Army then moved operations to Sunchang County (순창), continuing their guerrilla warfare against the Japanese military and administrative presence in the region.[^29] Despite the courage and dedication of Choe's forces, they faced overwhelming disadvantages in terms of weapons, training, and numbers when confronting the modern, well-equipped Japanese army and Korean government forces that had been co-opted by Japan.

In June 1906, Choe's forces were defeated by superior Japanese and pro-Japanese Korean government troops. Choe was captured and, recognizing his significance as a symbolic leader of Korean resistance, Japanese authorities decided to remove him from Korea entirely.[^30] On August 27, 1906, he was forcibly transported to Tsushima Island, a Japanese island in the Korea Strait that had historically served as an intermediary between Korea and Japan and now functioned as a detention site for Korean independence fighters.[^31]

Imprisoned at a Japanese military garrison on Tsushima, Choe faced a choice: accept his captivity and survive, or resist even in chains. True to his lifelong principles of uncompromising resistance, Choe chose defiance. He refused to eat the food provided by his Japanese captors, conducting what would today be recognized as a hunger strike—a final act of resistance against an enemy he would not accommodate even to preserve his own life.[^32]

After approximately three to four months of imprisonment, during which he steadfastly maintained his hunger strike, Choe Ik-hyeon died on January 1, 1907 (Gregorian calendar), corresponding to November 17, 1906 on the lunar calendar.[^33] The official cause of death was recorded as apoplexy (stroke), though this was likely precipitated by the severe physical toll of his prolonged refusal of food.[^34] His remains were transported by ship from Tsushima to Choryang (草梁) in Dongnae, Gyeongsangnam Province on January 5, where they were received by fellow Koreans who mourned the loss of one of their nation's most dedicated patriots.[^35]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Choe Ik-hyeon is widely honored in modern Korea as a nationalist hero and independence martyr, his legacy is complicated by several significant controversies and legitimate criticisms that reflect the tension between different forms of nationalism and competing visions for Korea's future.

The most fundamental criticism of Choe centers on his staunch conservatism and resistance to modernization. Throughout his career, Choe opposed not only Japanese imperialism but also Western learning, technology, and political reforms that might have strengthened Korea's ability to resist foreign domination.[^36] His Wijeong Cheoksa ideology made no distinction between predatory imperialism and potentially beneficial aspects of modernization, rejecting all foreign influence as inherently corrupting heterodoxy. Critics argue that this blanket rejection of reform weakened Korea precisely when the nation needed to modernize its military, economy, and political institutions to compete with imperial powers.

Choe's opposition to the 1876 treaty and subsequent reform efforts placed him in direct conflict with the Progressive Movement (Gaehwa faction) led by reformers like Kim Ok-gyun, who sought to modernize Korea along the lines of Meiji Japan's reforms.[^37] These progressives argued that selective adoption of Western technology, military organization, and administrative reforms represented Korea's only path to maintaining genuine independence in a world dominated by industrialized powers. From this perspective, Choe's conservatism, however well-intentioned, contributed to Korea's vulnerability by preventing necessary reforms.

The methods employed by Choe and the Righteous Army forces he inspired also raise ethical questions. The Righteous Armies engaged in violent attacks not only against Japanese soldiers but also against Korean civilians deemed to be collaborators (Chinilpa), including merchants who traded with Japanese, officials who implemented Japanese-backed policies, and individuals who adopted aspects of Japanese or Western culture.[^38] These attacks sometimes targeted Koreans whose "collaboration" consisted merely of pragmatic accommodation to circumstances beyond their control. The righteousness of violence against one's own countrymen, even in the name of national resistance, remains morally contested.

Furthermore, Choe's ideology contained elements that modern observers might characterize as xenophobic or isolationist. His writings equated Japanese and Westerners with "barbarians" and depicted foreign influence as inherently corrupting, reflecting a hierarchical worldview that placed Korean Confucian civilization at the moral center.[^39] While this perspective must be understood in its historical context—as a response to genuine imperialist aggression—it also reflected a cultural chauvinism that denied the possibility of beneficial exchange with other civilizations.

Some historians have also questioned whether Choe's military resistance in 1906 was strategically wise or primarily symbolic. By that point, Japan had already decisively defeated China (1895) and Russia (1905), establishing itself as the dominant power in East Asia. The Righteous Army forces, armed primarily with traditional weapons and lacking modern military training, had no realistic prospect of defeating Japanese forces.[^40] Critics suggest that Choe's military campaign, while morally courageous, was essentially a quixotic gesture that led to his death and the deaths of many followers without materially improving Korea's strategic position. Defenders counter that such symbolic resistance maintained Korean national consciousness during the darkest period and inspired subsequent independence movements.

Finally, Choe's rigid adherence to Neo-Confucian orthodoxy included support for the traditional yangban class system and hierarchical social order that many Koreans found oppressive. His vision for Korea's future looked backward to an idealized Confucian past rather than forward to a more egalitarian or democratic future. Progressive Koreans who sought not only national independence but also social reform found Choe's conservatism an obstacle to comprehensive national renewal.

## Personal Life

Very little detailed information about Choe Ik-hyeon's personal life, family relationships, and private character survives in the historical record. Like many historical figures from this period, documentation focuses primarily on his public career and political activities rather than intimate personal details. No specific information about his wife, children, or descendants appears in accessible English-language sources, leaving significant gaps in our understanding of his private world.[^41]

What can be inferred from his actions suggests a personality of extraordinary determination, moral conviction, and willingness to sacrifice personal comfort for principles. His decision to refuse food while imprisoned on Tsushima Island reveals a man of iron will, capable of enduring extreme physical suffering rather than accept even the most basic assistance from an enemy he considered illegitimate. This final act of defiance speaks to a character that placed principle above survival, honor above pragmatism.

Contemporary descriptions from his 1905 portrait, painted by the renowned artist Chae Yong-sin when Choe was 74 years old, show him wearing a distinctive hunter's winter hat, suggesting a man who maintained traditional Korean dress even as Western and Japanese fashions penetrated Korean society.[^42] The portrait, now designated as National Treasure 1510 and housed in the National Museum of Korea, depicts Choe with a dignified bearing and intense gaze, characteristics that align with accounts of his forceful personality and unwavering convictions.

As a devoted student of Yi Hang-no and a committed Neo-Confucian scholar, Choe would have structured his personal life according to Confucian principles of propriety, filial piety, and loyalty. His willingness to abandon a comfortable career as a government official and later to take up arms at an advanced age suggests someone who internalized Confucian teachings about the scholar's duty to remonstrate with authority and resist moral wrong regardless of personal consequences.

Choe's relationships with fellow conservative scholars and yangban who studied under Yi Hang-no formed a network of like-minded individuals who sustained each other's resistance efforts over decades. These relationships combined intellectual camaraderie, shared ideological commitments, and political collaboration in opposition to the Japanese-backed government. The loyalty Choe inspired in his followers—400 men willing to take up arms under the command of a 73-year-old scholar—testifies to his personal charisma and the depth of trust he cultivated.

His writings, including memorials to the throne and his famous "Appeal to Arms," demonstrate considerable literary skill and rhetorical power, suggesting a man of refined education and sophisticated intellect who could articulate complex arguments persuasively. The fact that these documents circulated widely and influenced thousands of Koreans indicates that Choe possessed not only moral conviction but also the communicative gifts to translate that conviction into effective political mobilization.

## Legacy

Choe Ik-hyeon's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, profoundly influencing Korean nationalism, the independence movement, and modern Korean historical memory. His martyrdom on Tsushima Island transformed him from a political figure into a powerful symbol of uncompromising resistance to foreign domination.

Most immediately, Choe's efforts in encouraging armed resistance through the Righteous Army Movement continued to bear fruit long after his death. The Righteous Army campaigns he helped inspire and organize persisted until 1911, sustained by the nationalism and anti-Japanese sentiment he had instilled in his supporters.[^43] Between 1905 and 1912, these volunteer guerrilla forces engaged in thousands of attacks against Japanese forces. According to Japanese military records, between October 1907 and April 1908 alone, over 1,908 attacks were carried out by Korean resistance fighters.[^44] At its peak in 1908, the Righteous Army reached approximately 70,000 fighters.[^45]

Although Japanese military operations, particularly the Great Suppression of the Southern Insurgents Operation in 1909, ultimately defeated the Righteous Army as an organized force within Korea, many survivors fled to Manchuria and Russia where they continued the fight as part of the broader Korean independence movement following Japan's formal annexation of Korea in 1910.[^46] These resistance fighters would eventually form the Korean Independence Army and other organizations that maintained armed struggle against Japanese colonialism for decades. Thus, Choe's military resistance in 1906, while unsuccessful in immediate terms, contributed to a continuous tradition of armed resistance that persisted throughout the colonial period.

In modern South Korea, Choe Ik-hyeon is honored as one of the nation's great patriots and independence fighters. His portrait, painted by Chae Yong-sin in 1905, has been designated National Treasure 1510 and is prominently displayed in the National Museum of Korea, where it serves as a visual reminder of Korean resistance to imperialism.[^47] The museum also preserves handwritten memorials Choe wrote to the throne, treating these documents as important cultural heritage that connects contemporary Koreans to their history of resistance.[^48]

On Tsushima Island, where Choe died, a memorial marker commemorates his martyrdom, serving as a site of remembrance for Koreans who visit to honor his sacrifice.[^49] This memorial represents a tangible connection between contemporary Korea and the struggle for independence, allowing new generations to pay respects to a national hero.

Choe's intellectual legacy as a defender of Korean cultural identity also persists. While his specific Neo-Confucian ideology no longer commands widespread allegiance in modern, predominantly Christian and secular South Korea, his broader message—that Koreans must resist foreign domination and preserve their unique cultural identity—resonates powerfully in contemporary Korean nationalism. Modern Korean discourse about maintaining cultural distinctiveness in the face of globalization often echoes themes Choe articulated more than a century ago, albeit in very different contexts.

In the narrative of Korean nationalist historiography, Choe occupies an important position as a bridge between traditional yangban resistance and modern nationalist independence movements. He demonstrated that opposition to Japanese imperialism extended beyond progressive reformers and included conservative elements of Korean society who, despite their resistance to modernization, shared a fundamental commitment to Korean sovereignty. This broadens our understanding of Korean nationalism as a multi-faceted phenomenon that united Koreans across ideological divides in opposition to foreign domination.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments of Choe Ik-hyeon in South Korea overwhelmingly emphasize his patriotism, moral courage, and pivotal role in Korean resistance to Japanese imperialism. Korean nationalist historiography positions Choe as an exemplary figure who placed nation above personal comfort, career advancement, and ultimately life itself.[^50]

Historians highlight Choe's prescience regarding the dangers of the 1876 treaty, noting that his warnings about Japanese economic penetration and the erosion of Korean sovereignty proved tragically accurate. His five-point memorial opposing the treaty demonstrated a sophisticated understanding of 19th-century imperialism and how unequal treaties served as instruments of domination rather than genuine diplomatic agreements.[^51] This challenges simplistic characterizations of conservative scholars as ignorant isolationists, revealing instead that some understood very clearly the predatory nature of foreign encroachment.

Scholars of Korean resistance movements emphasize Choe's crucial role in organizing and inspiring the Righteous Army forces that represented the first sustained military opposition to Japanese imperialism. Military historians note that while the Righteous Armies lacked the weapons and training to defeat Japanese forces, they nonetheless imposed significant costs on the occupation, required the deployment of substantial Japanese military resources, and maintained Korean resistance consciousness during a period when formal independence seemed impossible.[^52] From this perspective, Choe's military leadership, though ultimately unsuccessful in military terms, was strategically important for keeping alive the spirit of resistance.

Cultural historians appreciate Choe's contribution to preserving Korean identity during a period of intense pressure to adopt Japanese language, customs, and values. His dramatic statement about preferring decapitation to cutting his hair articulated what millions of Koreans felt—that seemingly minor cultural changes actually represented the destruction of Korean identity.[^53] By framing resistance in cultural and moral terms rather than purely political or military terms, Choe provided Koreans with a vocabulary for understanding what was at stake in their struggle against imperialism.

Choe is also admired for maintaining the Confucian ideal of the principled scholar-official who remonstrates with authority when the ruler makes errors, even at great personal cost. This model of intellectual integrity and moral courage continues to inspire Korean intellectuals and activists who see themselves as heirs to a tradition of speaking truth to power. The fact that Choe chose martyrdom rather than collaboration or passive acceptance provides a powerful counter-example to the Chinilpa collaborators who have been condemned in Korean historical memory.

Finally, Choe's influence on the trajectory of Korean nationalism is viewed positively by those who argue that he helped prevent the complete erasure of Korean cultural identity during the colonial period. By articulating a vision of Korean distinctiveness rooted in historical continuity and cultural tradition, Choe contributed to the ideological foundations that would later support the independence movement and the reconstruction of Korean national identity after liberation in 1945.[^54]

### Negative Views

Critical scholarly assessments of Choe Ik-hyeon focus on several significant shortcomings and the potentially counterproductive nature of his conservative ideology and methods. The most substantial criticism concerns his blanket opposition to modernization and reform, which some historians argue weakened Korea at precisely the moment when adaptation was essential for survival.

Scholars sympathetic to the Progressive Movement argue that Korea's best chance for maintaining genuine independence lay in rapid, comprehensive modernization along the lines pursued by Meiji Japan. From this perspective, conservative opposition led by figures like Choe prevented necessary military reforms, economic development, and administrative reorganization that might have strengthened Korea's capacity to resist imperialism.[^55] By conflating all foreign influence—whether predatory imperialism or potentially beneficial technology and ideas—with moral corruption, Choe's ideology created a false binary that left Korea unprepared for the modern world.

Some historians note the tragic irony that Choe's ideological mentor, Yi Hang-no, advocated "praising the Chinese" even as China itself was being humiliated and colonized by Western powers, demonstrating the bankruptcy of looking to traditional Confucian civilization for models of how to respond to modern imperialism.[^56] Choe's continued adherence to this worldview even after China's defeats in the Opium Wars and Sino-Japanese War reveals what critics see as ideological rigidity that prevented learning from historical experience.

The violent methods employed by the Righteous Armies Choe inspired have also drawn criticism. The attacks on Korean civilians deemed collaborators created divisions within Korean society and sometimes targeted individuals whose cooperation with Japanese authorities was minimal or coerced. Critics argue that this internal violence weakened Korean unity and provided Japanese authorities with propaganda to depict Korean resistance as chaotic and illegitimate.[^57] The question of who qualified as a traitor and who had the authority to make such judgments and execute punishment remains ethically problematic.

Progressive Korean historians and activists have criticized Choe's social conservatism, particularly his defense of the yangban class system and hierarchical Confucian social order. While Choe fought for national sovereignty, he showed little interest in the social emancipation of common people, women, or lower-class Koreans who faced oppression from the traditional system he sought to preserve.[^58] From this perspective, Choe represents only one form of nationalism—conservative, elite-centered, and backward-looking—rather than the progressive, egalitarian nationalism that ultimately proved more successful in mobilizing mass support for independence.

Some scholars question the wisdom of Choe's decision to launch military resistance in 1906 when Japanese dominance was already overwhelming. By that point, Japan had defeated both China and Russia, established itself as the dominant East Asian power, and secured international recognition (including from the United States and Britain) for its control over Korea. Resistance historians note that over 17,000 Righteous Army soldiers died in combat with relatively little strategic gain.[^59] Critics suggest that these lives might have been preserved for more opportune moments or that energy devoted to doomed military campaigns might have been better invested in building underground political organizations, educational institutions, or economic foundations for eventual independence.

Finally, postcolonial critics note that Choe's cultural nationalism, while opposing Japanese imperialism, was itself based on hierarchical assumptions about civilization that mirrored imperialist logic. His characterization of Westerners and even Japanese as "barbarians" reflected a Sinocentric worldview that denied the possibility of equal exchange among civilizations.[^60] While this worldview must be understood in its historical context, it also represents a form of cultural chauvinism that modern, globalized Korea has had to move beyond.
