## Summary

Hilma af Klint was a Swedish artist whose abstract paintings, created years before Kandinsky, Mondrian, or Malevich, are now recognized as pioneering works of abstract art. Working in secrecy, she created over 1,000 paintings inspired by spiritualism and theosophy. Her work was revealed to the public only decades after her death.
