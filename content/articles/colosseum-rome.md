## Summary

The Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheatre) is an oval amphitheater in the center of Rome, Italy, built 70-80 CE under emperors Vespasian and Titus of the Flavian dynasty. The largest amphitheater ever built, it could hold 50,000-80,000 spectators and hosted gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas. Constructed of concrete and stone, it stands as a testament to Roman engineering and remains Rome's most iconic symbol. Though partially ruined by earthquakes and stone-robbers, it's still an impressive monument to Imperial Rome's power and culture.
