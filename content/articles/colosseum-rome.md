## Summary

The Colosseum (Flavian Amphitheatre) is an oval amphitheater in the center of Rome, Italy—the largest ancient amphitheater ever built and a lasting symbol of Imperial Roman power and engineering. Constructed between 70-80 CE under the Flavian emperors Vespasian and Titus, the Colosseum could hold 50,000-80,000 spectators who gathered to watch gladiatorial contests, animal hunts, public executions, and dramatic re-enactments. Though earthquakes and stone-robbers left it partially ruined, the Colosseum remains Rome's most iconic landmark, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.
