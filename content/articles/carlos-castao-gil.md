## Background
- Castaño became prominent in Colombia’s armed conflict during the late 20th century, amid guerrilla insurgencies, state counterinsurgency efforts, and the growth of illegal economies.
- He is commonly associated with the Castaño family’s rise within paramilitary networks in northwestern Colombia.

## Role in the AUC
- The AUC (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia) functioned as an umbrella structure for multiple regional self-defense/paramilitary blocs.
- Castaño is widely described as a key founder and national-level leader who helped coordinate strategy, messaging, and alliances across blocs.
- The organization is broadly documented as responsible for serious human-rights abuses, including massacres and forced displacement, and it financed itself in part through extortion and involvement in narcotics trafficking.

## Politics, Negotiations, and Demobilization Context
- In the early 2000s, Colombia pursued negotiations aimed at demobilizing paramilitary structures; AUC demobilization processes proceeded amid controversy over accountability, victim reparations, and continued criminal activity by successor groups.
- Public debate around the AUC included questions about links between armed actors and local/regional political power (often discussed under the term “parapolitics”).

## Death
- He was killed in 2004.
- Reporting and later accounts commonly describe internal conflict within the AUC/paramilitary ranks as a key factor in his assassination.

## Legacy and Historical Significance
- Castaño remains a frequently cited figure in studies of Colombia’s paramilitarism and the political economy of the conflict.
- His leadership is often analyzed in relation to: (1) paramilitary expansion, (2) patterns of violence against civilians, and (3) the entanglement of armed groups with illicit markets.
