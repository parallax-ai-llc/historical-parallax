## Summary

Kanehiro Takaki was a Japanese naval surgeon who eradicated beriberi from the Japanese Navy through dietary reform in 1884, decades before the vitamin B1 deficiency cause was understood. He demonstrated that providing a varied diet (rather than polished rice alone) prevented beriberi, saving thousands of sailors' lives. He is considered the father of clinical nutrition in Japan.
