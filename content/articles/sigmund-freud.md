## Summary

Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between patient and psychoanalyst. His theories of the unconscious mind, dream interpretation, the Oedipus complex, and the structure of psyche (id, ego, superego) revolutionized understanding of human psychology and influenced psychiatry, philosophy, art, and culture throughout the 20th century. Though many of his specific theories have been revised or rejected by modern psychology, Freud's fundamental insight—that unconscious processes shape human behavior—transformed how we understand ourselves.

## Development of Psychoanalysis

### Early Influences

**Josef Breuer:**
Collaborated on "talking cure"—patient Anna O. discussed problems, symptoms improved. *Studies on Hysteria* (1895).

**Self-Analysis:**
Analyzed own dreams, childhood memories. Developed theory of unconscious.

### The Interpretation of Dreams (1900)

**Key Ideas:**
- Dreams are "royal road to unconscious"
- Dreams fulfill repressed wishes
- Manifest content (story) vs. latent content (hidden meaning)
- Dream symbols, condensation, displacement

**Impact:**
Freud considered this his masterwork. Sales slow initially; eventually landmark.

## Key Concepts

### Structure of Psyche

- **Id**: Unconscious, primitive desires—pleasure principle
- **Ego**: Conscious self—mediates id and reality
- **Superego**: Internalized morality—conscience

### Unconscious Mind

Vast realm of repressed memories, desires, traumas that influence conscious behavior without awareness.

### Oedipus Complex

Child desires opposite-sex parent, rivals same-sex parent. Universal (Freud claimed); must be resolved.

### Defense Mechanisms

- Repression
- Denial
- Projection
- Sublimation
- Rationalization

### Psychosexual Development

Stages: oral, anal, phallic, latent, genital. Fixation at stages causes personality issues.

### Libido

Sexual/life energy driving behavior. Later balanced by Thanatos (death drive).
