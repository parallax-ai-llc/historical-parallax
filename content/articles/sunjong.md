## Summary

Sunjong (born March 25, 1874; died April 24, 1926) was the second and final Emperor of the Korean Empire (reigned 1907–1910).[^1] Often remembered as a tragic and powerless figurehead, he was placed on the throne by Japan following the forced abdication of his father, Emperor Gojong. His brief three-year reign witnessed the final dismantling of the Korean state: the disbandment of the Korean army, the signing of the **Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1910**, and the end of the 519-year-old Joseon Dynasty. After the annexation, he lived as a demoted "King Yi of Changdeokgung" under Japanese surveillance until his death, which sparked the **June 10th Independence Movement**.[^2]

## Early Life and Coffee Poisoning

Sunjong was the fourth son of Emperor Gojong and Empress Myeongseong, but the only one to survive to adulthood. His health was famously frail, a condition often attributed to a poisoning attempt in his youth.
*   **The Coffee Plot (1898):** In 1898, an official named Kim Hong-ryuk, harboring a grudge against the royal family, spiked the Emperor's coffee with a massive dose of opium. Gojong sensed the strange smell and spat it out, but the Crown Prince (Sunjong) drank a mouthful. He collapsed, vomiting blood, and reportedly suffered from permanent damage to his teeth and cognitive functions, leaving him infertile and physically weak for the rest of his life.[^3]

## The Puppet Emperor (1907–1910)

Upon Gojong's forced abdication in 1907, Sunjong ascended the throne as the **Yunghui Emperor**. However, he held no real power. The Japanese Resident-General, **Ito Hirobumi**, controlled the government.[^4]
*   **Army Disbandment (1907):** Within days of his accession, the Japanese forced him to sign the order disbanding the Korean Imperial Army. This sparked the "Battle of Namdaemun," where Korean soldiers fought a desperate, losing battle against Japanese troops in the streets of Seoul, leading to the rise of the Righteous Army (Uibyeong) movement.[^5]
*   **National Humiliation:** Sunjong was forced to tour the country with Ito Hirobumi to "calm" the anti-Japanese sentiment, a move that only highlighted his status as a captive monarch.

## The Fall of the Empire (1910)

On **August 22, 1910**, the final blow was struck. Pro-Japanese ministers, led by Prime Minister **Yi Wan-yong**, signed the **Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty**, formally ceding Korea's sovereignty to the Emperor of Japan.
*   **Refusal to Sign:** Historically, it is noted that Sunjong refused to sign the treaty himself. The treaty bears his seal, but historians argue it was affixed by Yi Wan-yong under duress or forgery. Sunjong purportedly hid the Great Seal of the State, but it was seized.[^6]
*   **Demotion:** On August 29, when the treaty took effect, the Korean Empire ceased to exist. Sunjong was demoted from Emperor to "King Yi of Changdeokgung" and lived essentially as a prisoner in his own palace.

## Life in Confinement and Death

For the next 16 years, Sunjong lived a quiet, melancholy life in Changdeokgung Palace, playing billiards and receiving guests under the watchful eye of the Japanese police.[^7] He died on **April 24, 1926**, at the age of 52.

### The June 10th Movement
Much like his father's death seven years earlier, Sunjong's death became a rallying cry for independence. On **June 10, 1926**, the day of his state funeral, students and activists organized massive street protests shouting "Long Live Korean Independence!" Although smaller in scale than the March 1st Movement, the **June 10th Movement** united socialists and nationalists against Japanese colonial rule.[^8]
