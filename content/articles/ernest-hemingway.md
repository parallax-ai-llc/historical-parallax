## Summary

Ernest Miller Hemingway (1899-1961) was an American novelist, short-story writer, and journalist whose sparse, understated style revolutionized 20th-century fiction. His works—*The Sun Also Rises*, *A Farewell to Arms*, *For Whom the Bell Tolls*, *The Old Man and the Sea*—explore themes of war, masculinity, love, and loss with stripped-down prose and the "iceberg theory" of omission. A larger-than-life figure who fought in wars, hunted big game, fished deep seas, and lived in Paris, Key West, Cuba, and Idaho, Hemingway won the Pulitzer Prize (1953) and Nobel Prize in Literature (1954). His turbulent personal life, alcoholism, and eventual suicide made him an archetype of the tortured American writer.
