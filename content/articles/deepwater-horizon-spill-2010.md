## Overview

On April 20, 2010, the *Deepwater Horizon*, an ultra-deepwater offshore drilling rig operated by Transocean for BP, suffered a catastrophic blowout in the Macondo Prospect (Gulf of Mexico). The explosion killed 11 workers and sank the rig. For the next **87 days**, raw crude oil gushed uncontrollably from the seafloor wellhead, 5,000 feet below the surface. Live video feeds of the "black plume" mesmerized and horrified the world. It was the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history, devastating marine wildlife, coastal wetlands, and the fishing/tourism economies of five states.

## The Causes: "The Well From Hell"

The disaster was a "systemic failure" of cost-cutting and ignored warning signs.
**1. The Cement Job:** The cement pumped to seal the well bottom was unstable. Haliburton recommended 21 centralizers; BP managers used only 6 to save time.
**2. The Negative Pressure Test:** The test results showed the well was leaking, but the crew misinterpreted the data (the "Bladder Effect" theory) to justify moving on.
**3. The Blowout Preventer (BOP):** The massive failsafe device on the seafloor failed to cut the drill pipe and seal the well when triggered.

## The Explosion (April 20)

**9:45 PM:** Methane gas shot up the riser pipe onto the rig floor. The engine revved uncontrollably (runaway diesel).
**The Blast:** A massive fireball consumed the rig. 126 crew were on board. 115 escaped via lifeboats or jumping 60 feet into the burning oil-covered water.
**The Sinking:** The rig burned for 36 hours before capsizing and sinking on April 22.

## The Leak (87 Days)

Because the BOP failed, the well was wide open.
BP tried everything to stop it:
1.  **Top Kill:** Pumping heavy drilling mud to plug it. Failed.
2.  **Junk Shot:** Shooting golf balls and tires into the preventer to clog it. Failed.
3.  **Top Hat:** Lowering a containment dome. Failed (clogged with hydrates).

**Corexit (Dispersant):**
BP sprayed 1.8 million gallons of chemical dispersant (Corexit) to break up the oil. This was controversial; it kept oil off the surface but created toxic "plumes" underwater, the long-term effects of which are still studied.

**The Cap (July 15):**
Finally, a tight-fitting cap was successfully installed, stopping the flow.
**Total Discharge:** Approx. 4.9 million barrels (210 million gallons).

## Environmental & Economic Toll

**Wildlife:**
- ~800,000 birds died.
- Dolphin pregnancies failed at 4x the normal rate.
- Deep-sea coral colonies centuries old were suffocated.
**Economy:**
- Fishing in the Gulf closed for months.
- BP paid over **$65 billion** in fines, clean-up costs, and settlements.

## Legacy

The phrase "safety culture" became a buzzword in the industry.
The Obama moratorium on deepwater drilling lasted 6 months.
Paradoxically, drilling in the Gulf is now higher than pre-2010 levels, but with stricter oversights on BOP maintenance and cement testing.
