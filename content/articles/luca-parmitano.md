## Summary

Luca Parmitano was the first Italian to perform a spacewalk and became the youngest commander of the ISS at age 42 in 2019. During a 2013 spacewalk, his helmet filled with water due to a spacesuit malfunction, nearly drowning him in the vacuum of space — one of the most dangerous incidents in ISS history. He handled the crisis with remarkable composure.
