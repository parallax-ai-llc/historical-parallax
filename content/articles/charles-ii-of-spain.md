## Summary

Charles II of Spain (1661-1700), known as "El Hechizado" (The Bewitched), was the last Habsburg monarch to rule Spain, reigning from 1665 until his death in 1700. Born the product of severe inbreeding within the Habsburg dynasty, Charles suffered from numerous physical and mental disabilities throughout his life. Despite his health challenges, his 35-year reign witnessed important economic reforms and legal codifications, though Spain's European power declined significantly. His death without an heir triggered the War of the Spanish Succession, fundamentally reshaping European politics and ending Habsburg rule in Spain.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Charles II was born on November 6, 1661, in Madrid, Spain, as the only surviving son of Philip IV of Spain and his second wife, Mariana of Austria, who was also his niece. He entered the world just five days after the death of his older brother, Prince Felipe Prospero, the previous heir to the Spanish throne. His birth was overshadowed by concerns about his health, and contemporaries noted from the beginning that "from the day of his birth, they were waiting for his death."[^3]

The circumstances of Charles's conception were the culmination of generations of systematic inbreeding within the Habsburg dynasty. The Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs practiced marriage within the same extended family to an unusual extent. Of eleven marriages contracted by Spanish monarchs between 1450 and 1661, most contained some element of consanguinity. All of Charles's great-grandparents were descended from the same parents: Philip I and Joanna of Castile. By the time Charles was born, he carried identical copies for more than a quarter of his genes—his inbreeding coefficient was 0.254, higher than if his parents had been brother and sister.[^4][^5]

This extreme inbreeding manifested in severe health problems from infancy. Charles was a frail child who could not walk unaided until age four and required leg braces until age five. He suffered from rickets, a bone disease that affected his skeletal development. The inbreeding accentuated the characteristic "Habsburg jaw," a pronounced mandibular prognathism so severe that Charles could not properly chew his food, leading to chronic digestive problems throughout his life.[^6] He was also developmentally delayed, learning to speak late, though contrary to later myths, he did receive a comprehensive education that included elementary subjects, Catholic dogma, Latin, Italian, French, geography, and history under the tutelage of Francisco Ramos del Manzano.[^7]

Charles became king at the age of three years and eleven months when his father Philip IV died on September 17, 1665. His mother, Mariana of Austria, was appointed Queen Regent by the Council of Castile and ruled the vast Spanish Empire on his behalf until he reached legal adulthood at age fourteen in November 1675.[^8]

## Rise to Power

Charles's rise to actual power was gradual and contested, shaped by the political intrigues of the Spanish court during his minority and early reign. During the ten-year regency (1665-1675), his mother Mariana of Austria governed with the assistance of advisors, most notably Juan Everardo Nithard, an Austrian Jesuit and her personal confessor. However, the regency was plagued by power struggles, particularly with Charles's illegitimate half-brother, Don Juan José de Austria, Philip IV's only acknowledged bastard son.[^9]

Don Juan José emerged as a popular military figure and political rival to the regency government. In 1669, he led a military uprising that forced Queen Mariana to dismiss Father Nithard, marking Spain's first pronunciamiento (military coup)—a precedent that would haunt Spanish and Latin American politics for centuries. Despite this victory, Mariana managed to keep Juan José out of the central government by appointing a new favorite, Fernando de Valenzuela.[^10]

When Charles reached legal adulthood on November 6, 1675, he indicated his intention to assume control of government, supported by his half-brother. Valenzuela was dismissed, but the young king's authority remained contested. In early 1677, Don Juan José led another military demonstration, driving Mariana and Valenzuela from court and establishing himself as Charles's first minister. Although widely regarded as Spain's savior, Juan José's administration proved disappointing and brief; he died, possibly by poison, on September 17, 1679, having lost support through paranoia and self-aggrandizing policies.[^11][^12]

Following Don Juan José's death, Charles gradually assumed more direct control over governance. Despite his physical limitations and periodic bouts of illness, foreign diplomats and council reports indicate that Charles's mental capacities remained intact throughout his reign. A Savoyard diplomat, Costanzo Operti, described him as "affable and generous but shy and lacking self-confidence." Charles personally received foreign ambassadors and participated actively in governmental discussions, playing a full part in diplomatic negotiations.[^13][^14]

## Major Achievements

Despite the traditional historical narrative of decline, modern scholarship has identified several significant achievements during Charles II's reign, particularly in economic policy and legal administration.

**Currency and Economic Reforms**: The most important achievement of Charles's reign was the stabilization of Spain's chronically unstable currency. In the 1680s, Spanish officials issued a series of drastic deflationary decrees, revaluing the coinage at 25% of its previous value. The immediate impact was catastrophic—the total disruption of commerce and collapse of financial credit. Debtors were initially given three months (later extended to six) to repay government debts. However, having stabilized the position, in 1686 the coinage was readjusted to a more favorable rate and thereafter left unaltered. Despite their disastrous short-term impact, these financial measures ended the chronic monetary instability that had plagued Spain throughout the seventeenth century and helped drive sustainable economic growth.[^15][^16]

**Commercial Policy**: Charles's government established a committee for commerce that pursued orthodox mercantilist policies, encouraging domestic trade and industry. Recent research indicates that within Spain, population growth, agricultural output, and textile manufacture all began to recover during Charles's reign, contradicting the traditional narrative of universal decline. Many of the commercial and political policies initiated under Charles formed the basis for reforms enacted by his Bourbon successors.[^17][^18]

**Legal Codification**: One of the bright spots of Charles's reign was the 1680 publication of the *Recopilación de las leyes de Indias*, a vast compendium of the local laws governing Spain's American territories. This monumental legal work was intended to keep the legal codes of Spain and the Americas as close in nature as possible, providing a comprehensive framework for colonial administration that would endure beyond his reign.[^19]

**Colonial Administration**: Decrees were issued in Charles's name approving universities in South America that still exist today, including San Cristóbal in Peru (established 1680) and the Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala. These institutions became centers of learning and culture in the Spanish colonial world.[^20]

**Territorial Defense**: While Spain lost some territories to France during Charles's reign, the kingdom managed to retain the greater part of the Spanish Netherlands and its Italian dominions despite facing Louis XIV's France at the height of its power. In three successive wars with France (1667–68, 1672–78, 1689–97), Spain lost Franche-Comté and some Belgian frontier towns but successfully defended its core European possessions.[^21]

**Diminishing the Inquisition**: Charles's reign saw the final political eclipse of the Spanish Inquisition, an institution that had wielded tremendous power in Spain for nearly two centuries. When the Inquisitor General attempted to intervene in the royal succession crisis by arresting Charles's confessor on charges of "bewitching" the king, Charles established a Council to investigate the Inquisition itself. Although the institution survived formally until 1834, its political influence effectively ended during Charles's reign.[^22]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Charles II's reign was marked by numerous controversies, many stemming from his severe health problems, Spain's declining international position, and the succession crisis that dominated his later years.

**Physical Incapacity and Succession**: The most pressing controversy of Charles's entire reign was his inability to produce an heir. This was not merely a personal failing but a dynastic catastrophe with international implications. Charles married twice—first to Marie Louise d'Orléans in 1679 and, after her death in 1689, to Maria Anna of Neuburg. Both marriages were childless. Marie Louise was blamed for the failure to produce an heir and subjected to primitive fertility treatments that gave her severe intestinal problems. She died under mysterious circumstances in February 1689, with some suspecting poisoning.[^23] Maria Anna of Neuburg was specifically selected from a family famous for its fertility, but this marriage also failed to produce children.[^24]

**The "Bewitchment" Affair**: Charles himself came to believe he was the victim of supernatural malevolence, earning him the nickname "El Hechizado" (The Bewitched). In deeply religious and superstitious seventeenth-century Spain, his extreme and inexplicable ailments could not be understood through medicine alone. Charles was subjected to numerous exorcisms, forced to ingest sanctified oils, touch holy relics, and endure lengthy prayers. At one point, priests developed a theory that he was cursed, pointing to a small bag Charles always wore around his neck that contained toenails, hair, and other items believed to be spell components. According to contemporary reports, possessed nuns claimed the devil had confirmed that Charles was haunted by a curse preventing him from producing an heir and governing effectively.[^25][^26]

**European Maneuvering Over Succession**: From the day of Charles's birth, European powers anticipated his death and schemed over the division of the Spanish Empire. This "waiting for death" dominated European diplomacy for decades. Louis XIV of France and William III of England negotiated partition treaties (1698 and 1700) that would divide the Spanish Empire without consulting Charles or Spain. This treatment of Spain as a corpse to be carved up was deeply humiliating to Spanish national pride.[^27]

**Economic Dependency**: By the 1670s, despite Spain's vast colonial empire, the bulk of foreign trade was controlled by Dutch and English merchants. The domestic economy relied heavily on French labor and imported wheat. Although silver bullion imports from the Americas increased, the vast majority went to paying off foreign debtors rather than enriching Spain itself.[^28]

**Territorial Losses**: Under Charles's reign, Spain lost territory to an aggressive France under Louis XIV. The Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) and the Nine Years' War (1688-1697) resulted in the loss of Franche-Comté and several strategic towns in the Spanish Netherlands. While Spain avoided complete collapse, the trend of territorial loss reinforced perceptions of Spanish decline.[^29]

**Court Intrigue and Governance**: Charles's government was plagued by factional conflicts between different noble families and foreign influences. His mother's Austrian faction competed with his half-brother's supporters, and later his two successive queens brought their own partisan interests. This made consistent policy difficult and governance often chaotic.[^30]

---

## Personal Life

Charles II's personal life was defined by his severe health problems, two marriages, and his deeply religious character shaped by the superstitious atmosphere of the Spanish court.

**Health Conditions**: Modern medical analysis suggests Charles suffered from multiple genetic disorders resulting from centuries of Habsburg inbreeding. His inbreeding coefficient of 0.254 was extraordinarily high—higher than that of children born to siblings. Researchers have proposed that he likely suffered from combined pituitary hormone deficiency and distal renal tubular acidosis, both autosomal recessive disorders. Other scholars suggest aspartylglucosaminuria, a lysosomal storage disorder. These conditions would explain his characteristic facial features, developmental delays, skeletal deformities, recurrent infections, epilepsy, and infertility.[^31][^32]

Physical descriptions by contemporaries noted he was "so ugly as to cause fear." He had a large protruding tongue that made his speech difficult to understand, was bald by age 35, and died senile and wracked by epileptic seizures. His famous Habsburg jaw was so pronounced he could barely chew food. He suffered from frequent intestinal problems as a result.[^33]

**First Marriage**: On November 19, 1679, Charles married Marie Louise d'Orléans, the eldest niece of Louis XIV of France and daughter of Philippe I, Duke of Orléans. The marriage was politically motivated, intended to improve relations with France. Marie Louise was young, vivacious, and reportedly unhappy in the austere Spanish court. The failure to produce an heir led to her being blamed and subjected to various fertility treatments. She died suddenly in February 1689, with persistent rumors of poisoning, though this has never been proven.[^34]

**Second Marriage**: After a brief mourning period, Charles married Maria Anna of Neuburg in August 1689 by proxy, with a formal ceremony in May 1690. Maria Anna came from the Palatinate family known for fertility, and there were high hopes she would provide an heir. However, this marriage also proved childless, confirming that Charles's infertility was the primary issue. Maria Anna became deeply involved in court politics and the succession crisis, supporting the Austrian Habsburg candidate.[^35]

**Personality and Character**: Contemporary accounts describe Charles as shy, self-conscious, and prone to depression, but also kind and well-intentioned. Foreign diplomats noted his generosity and affability when receiving them. Despite reputedly suffering from bouts of depression, his participation in government meetings and reports from his council indicate his mental faculties were better than traditionally portrayed. His weak will has been attributed more to his insecurity from growing up with multiple disabilities in a decadent court that never expected him to survive, combined with the immense pressure of governing a declining empire.[^36][^37]

**Religious Devotion**: Charles was deeply religious, even by the standards of Counter-Reformation Spain. He came to believe there was something wrong with his soul and sought aid from confessors, friars, monks, and exorcists. This religious intensity was both a source of comfort and a vulnerability exploited by various court factions.[^38]

## Legacy

Charles II's death on November 1, 1700, marked the end of the Habsburg dynasty in Spain and triggered one of the most consequential wars in European history, fundamentally reshaping the continent's political landscape.

**End of the Habsburg Dynasty**: Charles was the last of the Spanish Habsburgs, a dynasty that had ruled Spain since 1516 when Charles V inherited the throne. The extinction of this line represented a seismic shift in European politics. The Habsburg genetic legacy ended not with a bang but with a whimper—Charles's extreme inbreeding made him a living testament to the dangers of dynastic marriage policies prioritizing bloodline purity over genetic health.[^39]

**The War of the Spanish Succession**: Shortly before dying, Charles signed a will on October 2, 1700, naming Philip of Anjou, the grandson of Louis XIV of France, as his sole heir to an undivided Spanish Empire. This decision, influenced by Spanish advisors who feared partition, was intended to preserve the empire's integrity. Philip was proclaimed King of Spain as Philip V on November 16, 1700. However, the prospect of a potential union between France and Spain alarmed other European powers. The War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714) pitted France and Spain against a Grand Alliance of Austria, Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, and several German states. The war concluded with the Treaty of Utrecht, which allowed Philip V to keep the Spanish throne but forced him to renounce any claim to France, established British naval supremacy, and redistributed Spanish territories in Europe.[^40][^41]

**Bourbon Spain**: The accession of Philip V established the Bourbon dynasty in Spain, which continues to the present day. Ironically, many of the economic and administrative reforms initiated during Charles II's reign provided the foundation for the more successful Bourbon reforms of the eighteenth century. The Bourbon kings built upon Charles's monetary stabilization and commercial policies.[^42]

**Scientific Interest**: Charles II has become a case study in medical genetics and the effects of inbreeding. Research published in prestigious journals like PLOS ONE has analyzed the Habsburg family tree and calculated inbreeding coefficients, using Charles as a prime example of how consanguineous marriages can lead to the extinction of a dynasty. His case appears in medical literature discussing autosomal recessive disorders.[^43][^44]

**Cultural Representation**: In Spanish history and culture, Charles II occupies an ambiguous position—simultaneously a figure of pity and a symbol of dynastic decline. He has been portrayed in historical dramas, academic studies, and popular accounts as "the last Habsburg" whose personal tragedy reflected Spain's transition from imperial power to secondary status in European affairs.[^45]

**Historical Reassessment**: Modern scholarship has worked to rehabilitate Charles's reputation, distinguishing between the genuine challenges he faced and exaggerated accounts of incompetence. Historians now recognize that Spain's decline was a long-term process with deep structural causes, not simply the result of one weak king's failings.[^46]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Recent historical scholarship has significantly revised traditional assessments of Charles II, revealing a more nuanced picture than the simple narrative of a disabled king presiding over inevitable decline.

**Economic Recovery**: Historians now argue that "both the myth of decline and an incapable king are simplistic and inexact." Economic historians have demonstrated that despite short-term disruptions, the monetary reforms of the 1680s provided crucial stability. Research by scholars examining parish records, textile production, and agricultural output has shown that Spain experienced demographic recovery and economic growth during Charles's reign, challenging the declinist narrative.[^47]

**Administrative Continuity**: Modern scholars recognize that the administrative and commercial policies developed during Charles's reign formed the foundation for the successful Bourbon reforms. The legal codifications, particularly the *Recopilación de las leyes de Indias*, demonstrated effective governance despite the king's personal limitations.[^48]

**Mental Capacity Vindication**: Contemporary diplomatic reports and council proceedings reveal that Charles was more mentally capable than traditionally portrayed. The French ambassador and other foreign observers noted his active participation in governance. One often-cited example of his alleged mental incapacity—sleeping with his father's disinterred corpse—has been debunked; this was done under instructions from his mother's doctors who advised it would help him produce an heir, not from any delusion on Charles's part.[^49]

**Personal Virtue**: Contemporaries and some historians have praised Charles's personal qualities despite his physical limitations. He was described as kind, generous, and genuinely concerned about his subjects' welfare. His religious devotion, while exploited by others, reflected sincere faith rather than weakness.[^50]

**Defensive Success**: Despite facing Louis XIV's France at its zenith, Spain under Charles managed to retain most of its European and all of its American territories. While this was partly due to the efforts of allies and military commanders, Charles's government deserves some credit for diplomatic and military resistance that prevented wholesale dismemberment of the empire.[^51]

### Negative Views

Despite scholarly rehabilitation, Charles II remains a controversial and often negatively assessed monarch in historical literature and popular understanding.

**Symbol of Decline**: For many historians, particularly those writing in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Charles epitomized Spanish decline. His physical deformities, attributed to Habsburg inbreeding, became a metaphor for dynastic degeneracy. Writers portrayed him as the inevitable result of centuries of misguided marriage policy.[^52]

**The Inbreeding Indictment**: Medical historians and geneticists have used Charles as a cautionary tale about consanguineous marriage. A 2009 study in PLOS ONE explicitly blamed inbreeding for the "extinction of a European royal dynasty," using Charles's inbreeding coefficient and childlessness as primary evidence. From this perspective, Charles's existence and reign represent a biological and political failure.[^53]

**Ineffective Leadership**: Critics argue that regardless of Charles's personal virtues, his physical and mental limitations made effective leadership impossible. His dependence on regents, advisors, and favorites led to policy inconsistency and factional conflicts that weakened Spain internationally. His inability to produce an heir—the most basic dynastic duty—was a catastrophic failure that led directly to a devastating European war.[^54]

**Lost Opportunities**: Some historians contend that Spain's relative economic recovery during Charles's reign was insufficient and came too late. More vigorous and capable leadership might have reformed Spain's economy and administration more thoroughly, better positioning the country for eighteenth-century challenges.[^55]

**Contemporary Mockery**: Even during his lifetime, Charles was the subject of mockery and pity. Foreign courts referred to him dismissively, and the very nickname "El Hechizado" (The Bewitched) reflected contemporary contempt. His autopsy report—which noted his heart was "the size of a peppercorn," his lungs "corroded," his intestines "rotten and gangrenous," with "a single testicle, black as coal," and his "head full of water"—has been cited repeatedly as evidence of his physical wretchedness.[^56]

## Famous Quotes

> "I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country."

This quote, attributed to Charles II near the end of his life, reflects his awareness of Spain's decline and his own inability to produce an heir, leading to the succession crisis.[^57]

> "My subjects are like children; they cry, but they must be allowed to have their way."

This statement, attributed to Charles, suggests a somewhat passive governing philosophy, though its authenticity is debated among historians.[^58]

**Note**: Direct quotes from Charles II are rare in historical records, partly due to his speech difficulties caused by his pronounced Habsburg jaw and large tongue. Most accounts of his words come secondhand through diplomatic reports and court chroniclers. Many quotes attributed to "Charles II" in popular quotation sources actually refer to Charles II of England (1630-1685), a different monarch entirely, leading to frequent confusion.

**Contemporary Description by Operti**: 

> "[He is] affable and generous but shy and lacking self-confidence."

Savoyard diplomat Costanzo Operti, who attended regular audiences with Charles during the Nine Years' War, provided this description that has been frequently cited by historians.[^59]

**Autopsy Report (1700)**:

> "His heart was the size of a peppercorn; his lungs corroded; his intestines rotten and gangrenous; he had a single testicle, black as coal, and his head was full of water."

This graphic medical description from Charles's autopsy has become one of the most frequently cited documents about him, illustrating the severe physical toll of genetic inbreeding.[^60]
