## Summary

Al-Ghazali was a Persian theologian, philosopher, and mystic who is one of the most important figures in Islamic intellectual history. His Ihya Ulum al-Din (Revival of Religious Sciences) is one of the greatest works of Islamic literature. His Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of the Philosophers) challenged Greek-influenced Islamic philosophy. After a spiritual crisis, he embraced Sufism and integrated mysticism into orthodox Islam.
