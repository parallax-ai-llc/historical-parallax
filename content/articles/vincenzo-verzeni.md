## Summary
Vincenzo Verzeni was an Italian serial killer active in the 1870s near Bergamo, Lombardy. He murdered at least two women and attempted to kill several others. He was one of the earliest documented cases studied by pioneering criminologist Cesare Lombroso, who used his case to develop theories of criminal anthropology.

## Early Life
Born April 11, 1849, in Bottanuco, near Bergamo, Italy. He was from a rural farming family. He showed early sadistic tendencies and reportedly derived sexual pleasure from wringing chickens' necks as a child. [^1]

## Criminal Career
In 1871-1872, Verzeni attacked multiple women in the countryside near Bergamo, strangling them. He murdered at least two women — Johanna Motta and Elisabetta Pagnoncelli — and attempted to kill several others. He was motivated by sexual compulsion. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Verzeni was arrested in 1872 after witnesses identified him near attack scenes. He confessed under questioning. He was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. His case was famously studied by Cesare Lombroso. He died in prison on April 1, 1918. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

- Helped establish the concept of serial killing as a distinct criminal phenomenon

## Negative Perspectives
