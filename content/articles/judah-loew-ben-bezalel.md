## Summary

Judah Loew ben Bezalel, known as the Maharal of Prague, was a leading rabbi, philosopher, and mystic who served as Chief Rabbi of Prague. He is best known in popular culture for the legend of the Golem — an artificial being he supposedly created to protect the Jewish community. His philosophical works on education, ethics, and Jewish destiny profoundly influenced later Jewish thought, including Hasidism. He met Emperor Rudolf II of the Holy Roman Empire.
