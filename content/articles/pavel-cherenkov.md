## Summary

Pavel Cherenkov experimentally discovered the radiation effect that bears his name (Cherenkov radiation) in 1934 — the blue glow emitted when charged particles travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium. He shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics. Cherenkov detectors are now essential tools in high-energy physics.
