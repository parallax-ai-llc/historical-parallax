## Summary

Karl Heinrich Marx (1818-1883) was a German philosopher, economist, historian, and revolutionary socialist whose ideas fundamentally shaped modern political and economic thought. His critique of capitalism, developed in *Das Kapital* and with Friedrich Engels in *The Communist Manifesto*, argued that capitalism alienates workers, exploits their labor, and will inevitably be overthrown by proletarian revolution leading to socialism and ultimately communism—a classless society. While regimes claiming Marxist inspiration (Soviet Union, Maoist China) resulted in millions of deaths, Marx's analysis of class conflict, ideology, and capitalism's contradictions continues to influence economics, sociology, history, and politics.

## Key Ideas

### Historical Materialism

History driven by material/economic conditions, not ideas. Mode of production (how society produces goods) determines social structures, politics, culture.

**Stages:** Primitive communism → slavery → feudalism → capitalism → socialism → communism

### Class Struggle

"The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles."

Society divided into classes with conflicting interests:
- **Bourgeoisie**: Owners of means of production
- **Proletariat**: Workers who sell labor

### Critique of Capitalism

**Exploitation:**
Workers produce more value than they receive in wages. The difference (surplus value) goes to capitalists as profit.

**Alienation:**
Under capitalism, workers alienated from:
- Their labor (forced, not fulfilling)
- Products of labor (owned by capitalists)
- Fellow workers (competition)
- Human nature (creative potential suppressed)

**Contradictions:**
Capitalism contains internal contradictions—crises, concentration of wealth, growing proletariat—that will lead to its collapse.

### Revolution and Communism

Proletariat will overthrow bourgeoisie through revolution. "Dictatorship of the proletariat" transitions to communism: classless, stateless society where means of production are commonly owned.
