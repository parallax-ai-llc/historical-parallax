## Summary

Akbar the Great (1542-1605) was the third Mughal emperor who ruled the Indian subcontinent from 1556 to 1605, transforming a fragile dynasty into one of history's most powerful empires. Born Jalal-ud-din Muhammad Akbar, he ascended the throne at age thirteen and went on to expand Mughal territory across most of the Indian subcontinent through military conquest and diplomatic alliances. He is renowned for his policy of religious tolerance, administrative innovations, and patronage of arts and culture that ushered in a golden age of Indo-Persian civilization. His reign marked a pivotal transformation in South Asian history, establishing administrative systems and cultural synthesis that would influence the region for centuries. Despite his illiteracy, Akbar was a brilliant strategist and philosopher-king whose legacy remains deeply contested between those who celebrate his pluralism and those who critique his military conquests and political pragmatism.

## Early Life and Background

Akbar was born on October 15, 1542, in the Rajput fortress of Umerkot in Sindh (present-day Pakistan), where his father Humayun had taken refuge during his exile from India.[^1] His birth came at a precarious moment for the Mughal dynasty—his grandfather Babur had founded the empire in 1526, but Humayun had been driven out by the Afghan leader Sher Shah Suri, forcing the family into a peripatetic existence across Persia and Afghanistan.[^2] Akbar's mother, Hamida Banu Begum, was a Persian Shi'a Muslim, and his early childhood was marked by instability and constant movement as his father plotted his return to power.[^3]

The young prince received limited formal education and remained functionally illiterate throughout his life, a fact that he later turned into a philosophical virtue, claiming that unmediated experience was superior to book learning.[^4] However, his education was far from deficient—he was trained in martial arts, hunting, and military strategy, skills essential for a Mughal prince. His tutors included Bairam Khan, a Persian Shi'a noble who would later serve as his regent, and he was exposed to Persian, Turkish, and Chagatai cultural traditions.[^5]

Akbar spent much of his early childhood in Kabul after Humayun recaptured it in 1545, and he developed a love for the rugged Afghan landscape and its warrior culture.[^6] At age nine, he reportedly killed his first animal in a hunt, and by eleven, he was leading military expeditions. This early exposure to warfare and governance would prove invaluable when he suddenly became emperor at thirteen following Humayun's accidental death in 1556.[^7] The circumstances of his succession were dire—the Mughal hold on North India was tenuous, with powerful Afghan and Rajput rivals threatening from all sides.

## Rise to Power

Akbar's accession to the throne on February 14, 1556, occurred at one of the most critical junctures in Mughal history.[^8] His father Humayun had only recently recaptured Delhi and Agra from the Surs, and the young emperor faced immediate existential threats. The Afghan general Hemu, who had declared himself Raja Vikramaditya, was marching on Delhi with a formidable army after defeating Mughal forces in multiple engagements.[^9] The future of the dynasty hung in the balance.

The decisive moment came at the Second Battle of Panipat on November 5, 1556, where Akbar's forces, led by his regent Bairam Khan, confronted Hemu's much larger army.[^10] Though only thirteen and nominally in command, Akbar was present on the battlefield, providing symbolic leadership. The battle's turning point came when an arrow struck Hemu in the eye, causing confusion in his ranks and leading to a Mughal victory.[^11] This victory secured Delhi and Agra, establishing Akbar's legitimacy as emperor, though real power remained with Bairam Khan for the next four years.

The period of Bairam Khan's regency (1556-1560) was marked by aggressive military campaigns to consolidate Mughal power, including the conquest of Gwalior, Jaunpur, and Ajmer.[^12] However, as Akbar matured, he grew resentful of his regent's domination and the influence of Persian nobles at court. In 1560, encouraged by his nurse Maham Anga and other court factions, the eighteen-year-old emperor dismissed Bairam Khan and assumed personal control of the empire.[^13] This marked the beginning of his true reign.

Akbar's early years of personal rule were characterized by a learning curve in which he consolidated power by balancing various court factions and demonstrating military prowess. He led campaigns personally, including the siege of the formidable Rajput fortress of Chittorgarh in 1567-68, where his forces captured the citadel after a lengthy siege, though at great cost.[^14] This period established his reputation as both a capable warrior and a ruthless conqueror—the fall of Chittorgarh was followed by massacres that sent a clear message to other Rajput kingdoms about the cost of resistance.[^15]

However, Akbar soon recognized that military conquest alone could not sustain his empire. He began implementing his revolutionary policy of Sulh-i-Kul (universal peace) and strategic marriage alliances with Rajput kingdoms, beginning with his marriage to the princess of Amber (Jaipur) in 1562.[^16] This diplomatic approach transformed former enemies into allies, with Rajput nobles becoming key pillars of Mughal military and administrative power. By 1570, Akbar had established himself as the undisputed master of North India, with a unique blend of military might and political acumen that would define his reign.[^17]

## Major Achievements

### Military Conquests and Imperial Expansion

Akbar transformed the Mughal Empire from a regional power into a subcontinental empire spanning from Afghanistan to Bengal and from the Himalayas to the Godavari River.[^18] His military campaigns were characterized by a combination of overwhelming force, siege warfare expertise, and strategic diplomacy. The conquest of Gujarat (1572-1573) secured access to vital ports and maritime trade routes, while the annexation of Bengal (1574-1576) brought the wealthy eastern provinces under Mughal control.[^19] His campaigns in Rajputana (1567-1570) broke the power of independent Rajput kingdoms, though he wisely integrated cooperative Rajput rulers into his administrative system rather than attempting complete subjugation.[^20]

The conquest of Kashmir (1586-1587) extended Mughal power into the northern mountains, while campaigns in Sindh, parts of Baluchistan, and Kandahar secured the western frontiers.[^21] By the end of his reign, Akbar controlled an empire of approximately 3.2 million square kilometers with an estimated population of 100-150 million people, making it one of the world's largest and wealthiest empires.[^22] His military success was built on a professional standing army, advanced artillery, and the integration of diverse military traditions—Mughal cavalry, Rajput warriors, and infantry armed with matchlock guns.[^23]

### Administrative Reforms

Akbar's administrative innovations created a centralized bureaucratic system that would govern India for centuries. His most significant reform was the mansabdari system, which organized military and civil officials into a hierarchical ranking system (mansabs) based on the number of cavalry they were required to maintain.[^24] This system ensured loyalty to the emperor rather than to regional power centers and created a meritocratic pathway for advancement that was relatively open to talent regardless of ethnic or religious background.[^25]

His revenue reforms, implemented by his finance minister Raja Todar Mal, revolutionized tax collection in India.[^26] The zabti system carefully measured and assessed agricultural land, establishing tax rates based on actual productivity rather than arbitrary demands. This created predictable revenue streams for the state while reducing the burden on peasants and encouraging agricultural expansion.[^27] The reforms included detailed land surveys, standardized weights and measures, and a sophisticated system of record-keeping that became the model for subsequent Indian administrations, including the British Raj.[^28]

Akbar also established a highly efficient postal system, a network of roads with caravanserais (rest houses), and standardized coinage that facilitated trade across his vast empire.[^29] His administrative capital at Fatehpur Sikri, built between 1571 and 1585, represented an architectural vision of his syncretic empire, blending Hindu, Islamic, and Persian elements into a stunning planned city.[^30]

### Religious Policy and Sulh-i-Kul

Perhaps Akbar's most revolutionary achievement was his policy of religious tolerance and pluralism, encapsulated in the concept of Sulh-i-Kul (universal peace or tolerance).[^31] Breaking with Islamic orthodoxy, Akbar abolished the jizya tax on non-Muslims in 1564, a move that shocked conservative ulama but endeared him to his majority Hindu subjects.[^32] He also eliminated the pilgrimage tax on Hindus visiting sacred sites and prohibited forced conversion to Islam.[^33]

Akbar's religious curiosity led him to establish the Ibadat Khana (House of Worship) at Fatehpur Sikri in 1575, where he hosted debates among scholars from different faiths—Islam, Hinduism, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, and Christianity.[^34] Jesuits from Goa were invited to his court and engaged in lengthy theological discussions with the emperor, though their hopes of converting him were disappointed.[^35] These exchanges profoundly influenced Akbar's thinking, leading him to develop Din-i-Ilahi (Divine Faith), a syncretic spiritual movement that drew elements from various religions while emphasizing reason, ethical living, and loyalty to the emperor.[^36]

While Din-i-Ilahi never became a widespread religion and was largely confined to a small circle of courtiers, it represented Akbar's vision of transcending sectarian divisions.[^37] His religious policies created space for Hindu administrators to rise to the highest positions in his government, with Rajput nobles like Raja Man Singh and Raja Bhagwan Das serving as his most trusted generals and advisors.[^38]

### Cultural Patronage and Artistic Flowering

Akbar's reign witnessed an extraordinary cultural renaissance that synthesized Persian, Indian, and Central Asian traditions into a distinctive Mughal civilization.[^39] He was an enthusiastic patron of the arts, despite his illiteracy, and established a royal atelier that employed hundreds of artists, including Persian masters like Abd al-Samad and Indian painters who developed the distinctive Mughal miniature style.[^40] His illustrated manuscripts, including the Hamzanama (containing 1,400 paintings), the Akbarnama, and the Razmnama (a Persian translation of the Mahabharata), represent some of the finest achievements in Indo-Persian art.[^41]

Akbar's court attracted scholars, poets, musicians, and architects from across Asia. The legendary Nine Jewels (Navaratnas) of his court included the musician Tansen, whose dhrupad compositions remain central to Hindustani classical music; the poet Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan; and the finance minister Raja Todar Mal.[^42] The emperor established a library of over 24,000 volumes, which were read aloud to him daily, covering subjects from history and philosophy to science and literature.[^43]

His architectural legacy includes not only Fatehpur Sikri but also the expansion of the Agra Fort, which he transformed into a magnificent red sandstone palace complex blending Islamic and Hindu architectural elements.[^44] The aesthetic principles established during Akbar's reign—the integration of Persian and Indian styles, the use of pietra dura (inlaid stonework), and the emphasis on gardens and water features—would reach their apex in later Mughal monuments like the Taj Mahal.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Military Brutality and Massacres

Despite his reputation for tolerance, Akbar's military campaigns were often marked by extreme brutality characteristic of 16th-century warfare. The siege of Chittorgarh in 1568 ended with the massacre of approximately 30,000 civilians after the fortress fell, an act intended to terrorize other resistant Rajput kingdoms into submission.[^46] Similar atrocities occurred at Ranthambore and during the conquest of Gujarat, where entire populations were put to the sword as examples to others.[^47]

His treatment of his brother Muhammad Hakim, who ruled Kabul and periodically rebelled against Akbar's authority, demonstrated the emperor's ruthlessness toward family members who threatened his power.[^48] While he eventually reconciled with Hakim, other relatives and nobles who fell out of favor faced execution, imprisonment, or exile. The rebellion of his eldest son Salim (later Emperor Jahangir) in 1599-1605 created a tense final period of Akbar's reign, with the empire teetering on the brink of civil war.[^49]

### Religious Policies and Orthodox Opposition

While modern secular historians often praise Akbar's religious tolerance, many conservative Muslims in his time and subsequently have condemned his departure from Islamic orthodoxy as heretical.[^50] The abolition of the jizya, which was sanctioned by Islamic law, his prohibition of cow slaughter to appease Hindu sentiments, and his assumption of the right to independent religious interpretation (ijtihad) through the Mahzar decree of 1579 were seen as violations of Sharia.[^51]

Din-i-Ilahi, despite its limited following, was viewed by orthodox ulama as an attempt to create a new religion and elevate Akbar to prophet-like status, a form of blasphemy in Islamic theology.[^52] His attendance at Hindu festivals, practice of sun worship, and marriage to Rajput princesses who were allowed to maintain their Hindu faith and temples within the palace were scandalous to conservatives.[^53] These policies contributed to several rebellions by Islamic nobles and clerics during his reign, most notably the uprising in Bengal led by Afghan nobles in the 1580s.[^54]

### The Din-i-Ilahi Controversy

The creation of Din-i-Ilahi remains one of the most debated aspects of Akbar's legacy. Critics argue it represented the emperor's megalomania and desire to be worshipped as a divine figure, with initiation ceremonies that included prostration before Akbar and declarations of total devotion.[^55] The movement's emphasis on loyalty to the emperor as a central tenet has been interpreted as a political tool to consolidate power rather than a genuine spiritual movement.[^56]

Historians remain divided on whether Din-i-Ilahi was a sincere attempt at religious synthesis, a political strategy to transcend Muslim-Hindu divisions and create an imperial cult, or simply Akbar's personal philosophical exploration with no broader agenda.[^57] The fact that it disappeared almost immediately after his death suggests it had little genuine spiritual appeal beyond court politics.[^58]

### Treatment of Women and Harem Politics

The Mughal harem system, which Akbar maintained and expanded, has been criticized by modern scholars as an institution of female subordination and political manipulation.[^59] While Akbar's marriages to Rajput princesses are often portrayed as enlightened diplomacy, they were also transactions that treated women as political pawns to cement alliances. These princesses were typically separated from their natal families and absorbed into the Mughal court system, where they had limited autonomy despite their high status.[^60]

The practice of maintaining hundreds of concubines alongside official wives, the strict seclusion of women in the zenana (women's quarters), and the use of eunuchs to guard and control women's movements reflected patriarchal structures that subordinated women regardless of their rank.[^61] While some women like his mother Hamida Banu and his foster mother Maham Anga wielded significant political influence, they operated within strictly circumscribed boundaries.[^62]

### Economic Exploitation and Rural Poverty

While Akbar's revenue reforms are often praised for their efficiency, critics point out that the Mughal empire extracted enormous wealth from agricultural peasants to fund the luxurious lifestyles of the emperor, nobles, and the military apparatus.[^63] Estimates suggest that the Mughal state claimed between one-third and one-half of agricultural output, a rate that left peasants with little surplus and made them vulnerable to famines during poor harvests.[^64]

The mansabdari system, while administratively sophisticated, created a parasitic noble class that consumed vast resources without contributing to productive economic activity.[^65] The empire's wealth was concentrated in the hands of the emperor and a few thousand mansabdars, while the vast majority of the population lived at subsistence level. The magnificent monuments, artistic productions, and lavish court ceremonies were built on the backs of millions of impoverished peasants and artisans.[^66]

## Personal Life

Akbar's personal life was complex and reflected the political and cultural dynamics of his empire. He maintained a large harem with dozens of wives and concubines, though his primary wives held the most significant positions.[^67] His first major political marriage was to the daughter of Raja Bharmal of Amber in 1562, a Rajput princess who became known as Mariam-uz-Zamani and was the mother of his successor Jahangir.[^68] This marriage established the template for Mughal-Rajput alliance through matrimony, and Akbar subsequently married princesses from several other Rajput houses.[^69]

His relationship with his sons was fraught with tension, particularly with his eldest son Salim (Jahangir), who grew impatient waiting for power and launched a rebellion that was only resolved shortly before Akbar's death.[^70] His second son Murad died young from alcoholism, and his third son Daniyal also succumbed to alcohol-related illness, leaving only Salim to succeed him.[^71] These family tragedies deeply affected Akbar, who had high hopes for establishing a lasting dynasty.

Akbar's personality combined contradictory elements: he could be ruthlessly cruel to enemies but showed extraordinary generosity to those in his favor; he was illiterate but intellectually curious and conducted sophisticated philosophical debates; he was a devout Muslim in youth but evolved into a religious skeptic and syncretist.[^72] Contemporary accounts describe him as charismatic, with tremendous energy and a commanding presence despite his modest height (approximately 5'7").[^73]

He maintained rigorous daily routines that included public audiences where subjects could petition him directly, private consultations with advisors, religious and philosophical discussions, and entertainment including music, poetry, and animal fights.[^74] He was passionate about hunting and personally killed thousands of animals, viewing it as both sport and military training.[^75] He was also fascinated by mechanical devices, collecting clocks and other automata from European traders.[^76]

Despite his many wives, Akbar formed deep attachments to several court companions and advisors, including the Sufi mystic Shaikh Salim Chishti, after whom he named his son Salim.[^77] His relationship with his chief minister Abu'l-Fazl, who authored the Akbarnama (chronicle of Akbar's reign), was particularly close, and Abu'l-Fazl's assassination in 1602 (likely orchestrated by Prince Salim) devastated the emperor in his final years.[^78]

Akbar's health declined in his early sixties, and he died on October 27, 1605, at Agra, likely from dysentery or poisoning, though the exact cause remains debated.[^79] He was buried in a magnificent tomb at Sikandra near Agra, which blends Islamic, Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian motifs, serving as a final architectural expression of his syncretic vision.[^80]

## Legacy

### Political and Administrative Legacy

Akbar's administrative and political systems formed the foundation of Mughal governance for the next 150 years and profoundly influenced subsequent South Asian political structures.[^81] The mansabdari system, revenue assessment methods, and centralized bureaucracy he established continued under his successors and were later adapted by British colonial administrators.[^82] His policy of incorporating local elites, particularly Rajputs, into the imperial structure created a model of collaborative imperialism that sustained Mughal power far longer than purely coercive rule could have.[^83]

The concept of the Mughal emperor as a universal sovereign standing above sectarian divisions, while never fully realized, provided an alternative vision to religious exclusivism that continues to resonate in modern discussions of secularism in South Asia.[^84] However, his successors gradually abandoned his syncretic approach—his son Jahangir maintained some tolerance but with less conviction, and his great-grandson Aurangzeb reversed many of Akbar's policies, reimposing the jizya and adopting Islamic orthodoxy.[^85]

### Cultural and Artistic Legacy

The cultural synthesis Akbar fostered created what scholars call the Mughal cultural complex, a distinct Indo-Persian civilization that shaped art, architecture, literature, music, and cuisine across South Asia.[^86] Mughal miniature painting, which reached its first peak under Akbar, influenced Indian art for centuries. The literary culture of his court, which produced histories in Persian, translations of Sanskrit texts, and new forms of Urdu poetry, laid foundations for South Asian literary traditions.[^87]

His patronage of musicians like Tansen helped codify and preserve Hindustani classical music traditions, and the dhrupad style flourished under his support.[^88] The architectural vocabulary developed during his reign—the synthesis of Islamic domes and arches with Hindu ornamental traditions, the use of red sandstone inlaid with white marble, and the integration of buildings with gardens—became the signature Mughal style that produced some of the world's most admired monuments.[^89]

### Religious and Philosophical Legacy

Akbar's religious experiments and his vision of Sulh-i-Kul have made him a contested symbol in modern South Asian politics. Indian secularists and pluralists celebrate him as a model of religious tolerance and point to his reign as evidence that Hinduism and Islam can coexist peacefully.[^90] His abolition of the jizya and elevation of Hindus to high office are held up as examples of enlightened governance in contrast to more exclusivist rulers.[^91]

However, Hindu nationalist interpretations are more ambivalent, acknowledging his tolerance while emphasizing that he remained a foreign conqueror whose military campaigns destroyed Hindu kingdoms and temples.[^92] Islamic conservatives view him as a heretic who betrayed Islam for political expediency and attempted to create a personality cult.[^93] These competing interpretations reflect ongoing debates about religious identity, secularism, and pluralism in contemporary India and Pakistan.[^94]

### Historical Assessments and Modern Relevance

Modern historians generally regard Akbar as one of the most successful rulers in world history, comparable to Augustus, Charlemagne, or Suleiman the Magnificent in his combination of military conquest, administrative innovation, and cultural patronage.[^95] His achievement in consolidating a diverse subcontinent under relatively stable rule while promoting economic prosperity and cultural flowering is widely acknowledged.[^96]

However, postcolonial and subaltern historians have complicated this triumphalist narrative by examining the experiences of conquered populations, the economic extraction from peasants, and the limits of Akbar's tolerance when faced with resistance.[^97] His legacy is increasingly understood as ambiguous—a military conqueror who nonetheless sought to transcend religious divisions, an autocrat who created efficient administration but concentrated enormous power, a patron of high culture whose court's luxury depended on mass exploitation.[^98]

In contemporary India and Pakistan, Akbar remains a significant historical reference point in debates about national identity, religious tolerance, and governance. Schools, universities, roads, and institutions are named after him, and his reign is featured prominently in textbooks, though how it is portrayed varies significantly between secular and religious nationalist narratives.[^99] His vision of an inclusive, pluralistic empire continues to inspire those seeking alternatives to religious nationalism, even as critics question whether such ideals can be separated from the imperial violence through which they were implemented.[^100]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly admirers of Akbar emphasize his extraordinary vision in attempting to create a universal empire that transcended religious and ethnic divisions. Historian John F. Richards describes him as "the greatest of the Mughal emperors" and credits him with transforming "a fragile military conquest state into a sophisticated empire with deep roots in Indian society."[^101] His administrative innovations, particularly the revenue system designed by Todar Mal, are praised as rational, relatively equitable for their time, and remarkably durable—they formed the basis of land revenue administration in India for over three centuries.[^102]

The Jesuit priest Father Antonio Monserrate, who spent time at Akbar's court between 1580-1582, wrote admiringly of the emperor despite his failure to convert to Christianity: "He is a great king, for he has dominion over many kings, and has brought into subjection numerous and extensive kingdoms...He is a man of great energy and of keen intelligence."[^103] Monserrate praised Akbar's curiosity, his willingness to listen to different viewpoints, and his administrative abilities.[^104]

Modern Indian historians like Romila Thapar and Irfan Habib have highlighted Akbar's role in creating a syncretic culture that remains central to Indian civilizational identity.[^105] His court's translation projects, which rendered Sanskrit epics into Persian and made them accessible to Muslim elites, and his support for Hindi devotional literature, helped create bridges between communities that might otherwise have remained isolated.[^106] The policy of Sulh-i-Kul is seen as a remarkable early articulation of religious pluralism that predates European Enlightenment concepts of tolerance.[^107]

Art historians celebrate Akbar as one of history's great patrons, whose vision created a distinctive Indo-Persian aesthetic that balanced naturalism with decorative elements and integrated multiple artistic traditions.[^108] His manuscripts and architectural monuments are considered among humanity's greatest artistic achievements, and his support for artists provided a model of enlightened cultural patronage.[^109]

Defenders of Akbar's legacy also point to his personal qualities: his courage in battle, his accessibility to subjects through public audiences, his willingness to admit mistakes and reverse policies, and his intellectual curiosity despite his inability to read.[^110] The fact that he maintained a stable empire for nearly fifty years while experimenting with innovative policies suggests both political acumen and genuine conviction in his vision.[^111]

### Negative Views

Critics of Akbar, both contemporary and modern, focus on several areas of concern. Orthodox Muslim scholars and chroniclers, beginning in his own time, condemned his religious innovations as heretical and his tolerance policies as violations of Islamic law.[^112] The influential Islamic scholar Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, who lived during Akbar's late reign and that of his successor Jahangir, explicitly rejected Akbar's syncretic approach and advocated for a return to Islamic orthodoxy, arguing that the emperor had led Muslims astray.[^113]

Modern critics question the extent and sincerity of Akbar's tolerance, pointing out that his religious policies were inconsistent and often politically motivated rather than principled.[^114] While he abolished the jizya on non-Muslims, he maintained Islamic law for Muslims and never questioned the fundamental structure of Islamic monarchy or his own position as sovereign.[^115] His Din-i-Ilahi, rather than being a genuine religious movement, is interpreted by skeptics as a personality cult designed to enhance his political authority by placing himself above both Islamic ulama and Hindu Brahmins.[^116]

Hindu nationalist historians have offered more critical assessments, emphasizing that despite his relative tolerance, Akbar remained a foreign Muslim conqueror whose empire was built on the subjugation of Hindu kingdoms.[^117] The massacres at Chittorgarh and other Rajput fortresses, the destruction of temples during military campaigns, and the incorporation of Hindu princesses into Muslim harems are highlighted as evidence that his relationship with Hindu subjects was fundamentally exploitative despite its diplomatic veneer.[^118]

Economic historians influenced by Marxist analysis have criticized the Mughal system under Akbar as fundamentally extractive, concentrating enormous wealth in the hands of a tiny elite while the vast majority of the population lived in poverty.[^119] Irfan Habib's studies of the Mughal agrarian system conclude that while Akbar's revenue assessments were more systematic than those of his predecessors, they still claimed such a large share of agricultural output that they stunted economic development and kept peasants at subsistence level.[^120]

Feminist historians have criticized the treatment of women in Akbar's court and the harem system more broadly, arguing that political marriages, seclusion practices, and the reduction of women to instruments of alliance-building reflected patriarchal structures that even an enlightened ruler like Akbar did not challenge.[^121] The fact that women had no independent political roles and could only exercise influence through male relatives or as mothers of potential heirs demonstrated fundamental limitations in Mughal social organization.[^122]

Some scholars question whether Akbar's achievements have been exaggerated by historians overly influenced by the hagiographic accounts of court chroniclers like Abu'l-Fazl, whose Akbarnama was essentially propaganda designed to glorify the emperor.[^123] When examined critically and compared to the realities of peasant life, military violence, and political repression, Akbar's reign appears less as an enlightened golden age and more as a typical early modern autocracy that differed from European absolutism primarily in its scale and cultural context.[^124]
