## Summary

Antonio Narciso Luna de San Pedro y Novicio Ancheta (October 29, 1866 – June 5, 1899) was a Filipino pharmacist, chemist, scientist, journalist, and military general who became one of the fiercest commanders during the Philippine-American War[^1]. A trained scientist with advanced degrees from Spanish universities and research experience at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, Luna transitioned from intellectual activism in the Propaganda Movement to military leadership in the Philippine Revolution[^2]. His brilliant military strategies, establishment of the first formal military academy in the Philippines, and uncompromising discipline made him both revered and feared[^3]. Luna's life was tragically cut short at age 32 when he was assassinated by fellow Filipinos in Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija, on June 5, 1899, in what remains one of the most controversial events in Philippine history[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Antonio Luna was born on October 29, 1866, at the family home along Calle Urbiztondo in Binondo, the bustling commercial district of Manila[^5]. He was the youngest of seven children born to Joaquín Luna de San Pedro y Posadas (1829–1891), a traveling salesman for the government tobacco monopoly from Badoc, Ilocos Norte, and Laureana Novicio y Ancheta (1836–1906), a Spanish mestiza from Namacpacan (present-day Luna), La Union[^6]. After the Luna family moved to Manila in 1861, his father established himself as a merchant in Binondo, providing a prosperous and comfortable upbringing for the children[^7].

The Luna household was intellectually vibrant and culturally sophisticated. Antonio's older brother, Juan Luna, would achieve international acclaim as a painter, winning the prestigious gold medal at the Madrid Exposición Nacional de Bellas Artes in 1884 for his masterpiece "Spoliarium"[^8]. Another brother, José, became a doctor, while Joaquín would later fight alongside Antonio in the Philippine-American War and subsequently serve as governor of La Union from 1904 to 1907 and as a senator from 1916 to 1919[^9]. His three other siblings were Numeriana, Manuel, and Remedios[^10].

At the age of six, Antonio began his formal education under the tutelage of a teacher known as Maestro Intong, learning reading, writing, and arithmetic[^11]. He subsequently enrolled at the prestigious Ateneo Municipal de Manila, a Jesuit institution where he demonstrated exceptional aptitude, particularly in the sciences[^12]. His Jesuit mentors quickly recognized his expertise in chemistry, which would define much of his early career[^13]. In 1881, at the age of 15, Luna graduated from Ateneo with a Bachelor of Arts degree[^14].

Following his graduation, Luna continued his education at the University of Santo Tomas, where he pursued studies in literature and chemistry[^15]. His scientific prowess was evident when he won first prize for a paper titled "Two Fundamental Bodies of Chemistry" (Dos Cuerpos fundamentales de la Quimica)[^16]. Despite his academic achievements, Luna's path would take an unexpected turn when his elder brother Juan invited him to continue his studies in Europe, setting in motion events that would transform him from scientist to revolutionary[^17].

## Rise to Power

In 1890, at the invitation of his elder brother Juan, Antonio Luna was sent by his parents to Spain to pursue advanced studies[^18]. He enrolled at the Universidad de Barcelona, where he acquired a licentiate in pharmacy, and subsequently earned his doctorate in pharmacy from the Universidad Central de Madrid in 1890[^19]. During his time in Spain, Luna immersed himself not only in scientific pursuits but also in political activism, joining the Propaganda Movement alongside prominent Filipino intellectuals such as José Rizal and Marcelo H. del Pilar[^20].

Luna became an active contributor to La Solidaridad, the movement's principal publication that promoted reforms in the Philippines under Spanish rule[^21]. Writing under the pseudonym "Taga-Ilog" (meaning "from the river" in Tagalog), he penned political essays and articles titled "Impressions," which dissected Spanish customs and idiosyncrasies while passionately defending Filipino rights[^22][^23]. His writings were characterized by their incisiveness and intellectual rigor, helping to shape the discourse within the reformist movement[^24]. Luna later became editor of La Solidaridad, cementing his role as a leading voice in the campaign for Philippine representation in the Spanish Cortes and equal rights for Filipinos[^25].

After completing his doctorate in 1893, Luna relocated to Paris to conduct postgraduate work in bacteriology and histology at the prestigious Institut Pasteur[^26]. Under the guidance of Professor Latteaux, he engaged in experimental studies on pathogens, contributing to the era's groundbreaking advancements in understanding infectious diseases[^27]. He subsequently traveled to Belgium to train in medical analysis (medical chemistry) under Professor Laffons[^28]. During this period, Luna published a scientific treatise on malaria entitled "On Malarial Pathology" (El Hematozorio del Paludismo), which was favorably received in the scientific community[^29]. He contributed regularly to leading pharmaceutical journals, establishing himself as one of the few professionally trained scientists among Philippine revolutionary figures[^30].

In 1894, Luna returned to Manila with a research commission (grant) from the Spanish government to study the bacteriology of contagious diseases[^31]. Later that year, he took the examination for Chemist Expert of the Municipal Laboratory of Manila, achieved high ratings, and won the post[^32]. However, Spain's repressive policies and the growing revolutionary fervor in the Philippines soon drew Luna away from his scientific career and into the armed struggle for independence.

When the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule erupted in 1896, Luna initially remained ambivalent about armed rebellion, preferring the reformist approach of the Propaganda Movement[^33]. However, the execution of José Rizal in December 1896 and the intensification of Spanish repression gradually transformed his views. By 1898, Luna had committed himself to the revolutionary cause. In Fall 1898, President Emilio Aguinaldo promoted Luna to Supreme Chief of the Philippine Army, and he succeeded Artemio Ricarte as commander of the Philippine Revolutionary Army[^34].

Luna's appointment was controversial. Many Filipino officers resented his rapid ascension, particularly since he had not participated in the initial revolution against Spain and had even opposed the idea of armed rebellion[^35]. Nevertheless, Aguinaldo recognized Luna's intellectual capabilities, European military education, and potential to transform the ill-disciplined revolutionary forces into a professional army capable of confronting the United States, which had recently defeated Spain and occupied Manila[^36].

## Major Achievements

Antonio Luna's most enduring achievement was his establishment of the Academia Militar at Malolos in October 1898, which became the foundation of the modern-day Philippine Military Academy[^37]. Recognizing that the Philippine forces consisted largely of undisciplined volunteers organized along regional and clan lines, Luna envisioned a professional military institution that could train officers in modern warfare tactics and instill a sense of national unity above provincial loyalties[^38]. He appointed Captain (later Colonel) Manuel Bernal Sityar, a mestizo formerly serving in the Spanish Army, as superintendent[^39]. A score of veteran officers became teachers at the military school, and Luna personally devised two courses of instruction covering military strategy, tactics, field fortifications, and guerrilla warfare[^40].

Luna implemented comprehensive military reforms aimed at transforming the ragtag collection of revolutionary fighters into a disciplined fighting force. He established a three-tier defensive system, later known as the Luna Defense Line, designed to impede American advances into the provinces north of Manila[^41]. This defensive strategy forced American troops into protracted campaigns and demonstrated Luna's understanding of the asymmetric warfare necessary for a smaller force to resist a superior military power[^42]. He organized professional guerrilla units known as the "Luna Sharpshooters," who became famous for fighting more fiercely than regular Filipino army soldiers[^43]. A skilled marksman himself, Luna trained these sharpshooters to execute surprise attacks and conduct harassing operations against American forces[^44].

Luna's military innovations extended beyond combat tactics. He planned the reorganization of the army with specialized units including a battalion of tiradores (sharpshooters) and a cavalry squadron[^45]. He established inventories of guns and ammunition, created arsenals using convents and town halls as storage facilities, organized quartermaster systems, and set up communication and lookout networks[^46]. Luna insisted on strict military discipline, implementing a formal code of conduct and court-martial procedures for insubordination—measures unprecedented in the Philippine revolutionary forces[^47]. He was awarded the Philippine Republic Medal in recognition of his organizational work[^48].

Luna's most dramatic military actions occurred during the early months of the Philippine-American War in 1899. When hostilities erupted on February 4, 1899, at Santa Mesa near the Balsahan Bridge, Luna immediately mobilized his forces[^49]. From February 22 to 24, 1899, he launched a major counterattack on American positions, demonstrating tactical boldness that earned him respect even from his enemies[^50]. During the Battle of Calumpit on April 25–27, 1899, Luna's forces engaged American troops in intense fighting that temporarily slowed the American advance[^51].

The Battle of Santo Tomas on May 4, 1899, proved to be Luna's finest hour. Despite being wounded in combat, he personally led his troops in fierce resistance against superior American firepower[^52]. For his heroism during this engagement, President Aguinaldo presented Luna with the Medal of the Republic, with his heroic battles and corresponding dates inscribed on the back[^53]. This recognition represented the pinnacle of Luna's military career, acknowledging both his personal courage and his strategic contributions to the Philippine war effort.

Luna's strategic vision extended beyond immediate battlefield victories. He proposed a comprehensive strategy to trap American forces in Manila through coordinated surprise attacks while simultaneously building up Filipino strength in northern Luzon[^54]. He advocated for delaying tactics and the establishment of a mountain fortress in the Cordillera region, where terrain advantages could offset American technological superiority[^55]. Luna understood that the Philippines could not defeat the United States in conventional warfare and instead championed the guerrilla tactics and strategic withdrawals that would later prove effective in other anti-colonial conflicts[^56].

Beyond military matters, Luna contributed to nation-building efforts by attempting to forge a unified national army from disparate regional forces. He challenged the prevailing system where troops owed loyalty primarily to officers from their provinces, towns, or districts rather than to the central command[^57]. Luna envisioned "one united army for the Republic," recognizing that the absence of national consciousness and the persistence of clan armies presented fundamental obstacles to Philippine independence[^58]. Though his efforts to centralize military authority ultimately failed, his vision of a professional national army would eventually be realized in the post-independence Philippines.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Antonio Luna's volatile temperament and uncompromising approach to military discipline generated intense controversy and ultimately contributed to his assassination. Critics viewed him as "an intellectually arrogant man with an erratic temper" whose strict disciplinarian methods alienated both officers and common soldiers[^59][^60]. Luna had no patience for the inexperienced and undisciplined ways common to Filipino soldiers at the time, many of whom were formerly farmers or municipal clerks with no military training[^61]. His sharp tongue and tendency to publicly berate subordinates created numerous enemies within the revolutionary forces[^62].

Luna's confrontations with Aguinaldo's cabinet and fellow generals were legendary. In one cabinet meeting, when Secretary of State Felipe Buencamino advocated for compromise with the United States, Luna adamantly opposed the suggestion and physically assaulted Buencamino, knocking him down when the debate became heated[^63]. In another instance, Luna stormed into a cabinet meeting and physically attacked members, accusing them of corruption and incompetence[^64]. Such violent outbursts, while reflecting Luna's passionate commitment to the independence cause, demonstrated his inability to navigate the political complexities of revolutionary government and alienated potential allies[^65].

Luna's conflicts with military officers under his command proved equally damaging. He frequently berated generals and soldiers "with gusto, firing insults with generosity when he felt he needed to whip someone into shape"[^66]. During the Battle of Calumpit, Luna ordered General Tomás Mascardo to send reinforcements from Guagua to strengthen Filipino defenses. However, Mascardo ignored the order, insisting he was going to Arayat for an "inspection of troops," though another version claimed Mascardo had left to visit his girlfriend[^67]. The insubordination infuriated Luna, who had Mascardo detained—an action that further poisoned relations with Caviteño officers loyal to Aguinaldo[^68].

Luna's most consequential confrontation involved the Kawit battalion from Cavite. When Luna attempted to deploy this unit to relieve exhausted Kapampangan militia, the Kawit soldiers refused, stating they had orders to obey only instructions directly from President Aguinaldo[^69]. Such insubordination had become common among Filipino forces, where regional and personal loyalties superseded central command authority[^70]. Luna responded by disarming and arresting the entire battalion and publicly humiliating their commander, Captain Pedro Janolino[^71]. This action outraged Caviteño officers, many of whom came from Aguinaldo's hometown and felt personally insulted by Luna's treatment of their compatriots[^72].

Even Apolinario Mabini, the intellectual architect of the Philippine Republic and generally sympathetic to Luna's modernization efforts, described Luna as "a despot who didn't understand office work and the organization of the army"[^73]. Mabini's criticism highlighted Luna's limitations as an administrator and his tendency to prioritize military efficiency over political considerations[^74]. While Mabini acknowledged that Luna's harsh measures stemmed from desperation over "the demoralization of the soldiers and the lack of ammunitions," he recognized that Luna's methods were counterproductive in a revolutionary movement that depended on popular support and political cohesion[^75].

Luna's military record was also mixed. Despite his theoretical knowledge of military tactics and his personal courage, historical records indicate that he "never won any battle" during the Philippine-American War[^76]. The American forces, with their superior training, equipment, and logistics, consistently defeated Filipino forces under Luna's command. While Luna's defensive strategies and guerrilla tactics inflicted casualties and delayed American advances, they could not reverse the fundamental military imbalance between the two forces[^77]. Critics argued that Luna's aggressive temperament sometimes led to tactical errors and unnecessarily exposed Filipino soldiers to superior American firepower[^78].

Furthermore, Luna's late entry into the revolutionary movement raised questions about his commitment. Many Filipinos viewed him suspiciously because he "wasn't part of the Philippine Revolution and even went against the idea of it" during the Propaganda Movement years[^79]. His transformation from peaceful reformist to military commander appeared opportunistic to some, particularly officers who had risked their lives fighting Spanish forces since 1896[^80]. Luna's European education and elite background also created cultural distance between him and the predominantly peasant composition of the revolutionary army[^81].

The perception of Luna as excessively violent and authoritarian extended beyond interpersonal conflicts. His insistence on court-martial procedures and capital punishment for desertion and insubordination, while militarily justifiable, clashed with the more informal, familial structure of the revolutionary forces[^82]. Many Filipino soldiers saw Luna's disciplinary measures as harsh and foreign, imported from European military traditions rather than adapted to Filipino cultural norms[^83]. This cultural disconnect undermined Luna's efforts to build a cohesive national army and contributed to the resistance he encountered from soldiers and officers alike[^84].

## Personal Life

Antonio Luna remained a bachelor throughout his life, never marrying before his assassination at age 32[^85]. His single status was somewhat unusual for a man of his social class and era, particularly given his family's prominence and wealth. The demands of his scientific career, political activism, and ultimately military service left little time for domestic life, though historical records provide limited insight into his personal relationships or romantic interests.

Luna's family was central to his identity and development. His relationship with his famous brother Juan was particularly significant. Juan Luna's international success as a painter opened doors for Antonio in European intellectual circles and facilitated his advanced studies in Spain and France[^86]. The two brothers maintained close ties during Antonio's years in Europe, with Juan introducing Antonio to prominent members of the Propaganda Movement and supporting his intellectual development[^87]. The Luna family's prosperity and social standing provided Antonio with educational opportunities unavailable to most Filipinos of his generation, enabling him to pursue advanced scientific training at prestigious European institutions[^88].

Luna's personality was complex and often contradictory. To his admirers, he embodied fierce patriotism, intellectual brilliance, and uncompromising dedication to Philippine independence[^89]. His commitment to modernizing the Philippine military and his personal courage in combat earned him the respect of soldiers who fought under his command, despite his harsh disciplinary methods[^90]. Those who knew him well described a man of intense convictions, passionate in his beliefs and unwilling to compromise on matters of principle[^91].

However, Luna's volatile temperament and sharp tongue made him a polarizing figure. His tendency toward violent outbursts, public humiliation of subordinates, and physical confrontations with political opponents revealed a man who struggled to control his emotions under stress[^92]. Some contemporaries attributed this behavior to the frustration of dealing with an undisciplined army and a politically fractured revolutionary government, suggesting that Luna's harshness reflected desperate circumstances rather than innate cruelty[^93]. Others saw his temperament as a fundamental character flaw that made him unsuitable for the political dimensions of revolutionary leadership[^94].

Luna's intellectual pursuits reflected his multifaceted personality. A trained scientist with genuine research accomplishments, he maintained his interest in chemistry, bacteriology, and public health even while engaged in political activism[^95]. His writings for La Solidaridad demonstrated literary skill and political insight, combining scientific precision with rhetorical passion[^96]. Luna's time at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, one of the world's leading research institutions, placed him at the cutting edge of late 19th-century medical science[^97]. A famous photograph from the early 1890s shows Luna posing with a microscope at the Institut Pasteur, capturing his identity as a scientist before his transformation into a military commander[^98].

His transition from scientist to soldier was not entirely incongruous with his personality. Luna approached military science with the same intellectual rigor he had applied to chemistry and bacteriology, extensively studying military strategy, tactics, guerrilla warfare, and field fortifications during his time in Spain[^99]. He complemented his theoretical studies with practical training in swordsmanship and fencing, skills that would later aid him as a general[^100]. This combination of scientific methodology and martial prowess reflected Luna's belief that modern warfare required professional expertise rather than merely patriotic enthusiasm[^101].

Despite his public reputation for harshness, Luna maintained close friendships with several revolutionary figures. His correspondence and contemporary accounts suggest a man capable of warmth and loyalty toward those he respected, even as he ruthlessly criticized those he considered corrupt or incompetent[^102]. The intensity of Luna's personality—his capacity for both fierce friendship and bitter enmity—made him a man of extremes, incapable of the political moderation that might have prolonged his life[^103].

## Legacy

Antonio Luna's legacy in Philippine history remains profoundly significant, encompassing his contributions as both a military strategist and a symbol of uncompromising nationalism. The Academia Militar he established at Malolos became the foundation of the modern Philippine Military Academy, now headquartered in Baguio, ensuring that his vision of a professional, nationally-oriented military institution endured long after his death[^104]. Military historians continue to study Luna's three-tier defensive system, known as the Luna Defense Line, as an early example of asymmetric warfare strategies employed by a technologically inferior force against a superior military power[^105].

In modern times, scholars and historians have substantially reevaluated Luna's contributions to the Philippine independence movement. The first comprehensive scholarly biography of Luna was welcomed as crucial for clarifying "the relation between the two phases of the nationalist struggle"—the reformist Propaganda Movement and the armed Revolution—demonstrating Luna's unique position as a participant in both[^106]. His writings on military tactics and national defense principles continue to resonate in Philippine military education, studied as early attempts to develop indigenous military doctrine adapted to Philippine geography and conditions[^107].

Luna received praise from historians for his "strenuous efforts to organize a disciplined army operating according to careful plans and military science, rather than Aguinaldo's 'haphazard collection of clan armies'"[^108]. This assessment highlights Luna's most enduring contribution: his vision of a unified national army transcending regional and familial loyalties. While Luna failed to implement this vision during his lifetime, his efforts anticipated the challenges of nation-building that would confront the Philippines throughout the 20th century[^109]. The tension between centralized authority and regional autonomy, between professional military standards and informal command structures, remained central to Philippine political development long after independence[^110].

The 2015 biographical film "Heneral Luna," directed by Jerrold Tarog, brought renewed awareness of Luna's story to a new generation of Filipinos[^111]. The film's commercial and critical success sparked national conversations about leadership, corruption, national unity, and the ongoing relevance of Luna's struggles to contemporary Philippine politics[^112]. Popular quotes from the film, particularly "Negosyo o kalayaan? Bayan o sarili? Pumili ka!" (Business or freedom? Country or self? Choose!), became rallying cries for anti-corruption movements and expressions of frustrated nationalism[^113]. The film's impact demonstrated that Luna's life continues to serve as a mirror for Filipinos grappling with questions of national identity and political integrity[^114].

Luna's legacy as an "imperfect hero" has gained increasing scholarly attention[^115]. Modern historians emphasize that Luna's character flaws—his violent temper, political naïveté, and alienation of potential allies—do not diminish his contributions but rather humanize him, presenting a more complex and realistic portrait than traditional hagiographic accounts[^116]. This nuanced assessment allows Luna to serve as both inspiration and cautionary tale, demonstrating that patriotism and personal courage, while necessary, are insufficient without political wisdom and the ability to build coalitions[^117].

As the Philippines continues to navigate its post-colonial identity and relationships with foreign powers, Luna's spirit of uncompromising nationalism remains symbolically powerful[^118]. His refusal to compromise with American occupation, even when such compromise might have been politically expedient, resonates with Filipinos advocating for sovereignty and national dignity in the face of contemporary geopolitical pressures[^119]. Whether viewed as a visionary military reformer, a tragic victim of internal political divisions, or a flawed but passionate patriot, Antonio Luna occupies a permanent place in the pantheon of Philippine heroes[^120].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and defenders of Antonio Luna emphasize his unique position as the only professionally trained scientist among Philippine revolutionary leaders, combining European education with passionate Filipino nationalism[^121]. Luna's establishment of the Academia Militar represented a visionary attempt to professionalize the Philippine military and instill modern standards of discipline and organization at a critical moment in the nation's history[^122]. Military historians praise his strategic insights, particularly his recognition that the Philippines could not defeat the United States in conventional warfare and required guerrilla tactics, strategic withdrawals, and mountain fortresses to prolong resistance and potentially negotiate favorable terms[^123].

Apolinario Mabini, despite criticizing Luna's administrative abilities, ultimately defended him: "If he was sometimes hasty and even cruel in his resolution, it was because the army had been brought to a desperate situation by the demoralization of the soldiers and the lack of ammunitions"[^124]. This assessment reflects a broader scholarly consensus that Luna's harsh methods must be understood in context—he faced the nearly impossible task of organizing a disciplined army from undisciplined volunteers while simultaneously fighting a vastly superior military force[^125]. His "strenuous efforts to organize a disciplined army operating according to careful plans and military science" represented a necessary, if ultimately unsuccessful, attempt to give the Philippines a fighting chance against American imperialism[^126].

Contemporary historians emphasize Luna's contributions to nation-building beyond his military role. His insistence on loyalty to the Republic rather than to regional leaders or clan networks anticipated the challenges of creating a unified Filipino national identity[^127]. Luna's vision of "one united army for the Republic" reflected his understanding that political independence required more than military victories—it demanded the creation of national institutions and the cultivation of national consciousness transcending local loyalties[^128]. Scholars argue that Luna's failure resulted not from flaws in his vision but from the political fragmentation and regional divisions that would continue to challenge Philippine unity for generations[^129].

Luna's martyrdom at the hands of fellow Filipinos has been reinterpreted by modern scholars as symbolizing the self-destructive factionalism that undermined the independence movement. In this view, Luna becomes a tragic figure whose death exemplified the "bigger enemy than the Americans—ourselves" that the 2015 film attributed to him[^130]. This interpretation elevates Luna to the status of a prophet whose warnings about internal divisions went unheeded, resulting in his assassination and, ultimately, the failure of the First Philippine Republic[^131].

Recent scholarship has also emphasized Luna's cosmopolitan background and European education as assets rather than liabilities. His experience at the Institut Pasteur and his contributions to international scientific journals demonstrated that Filipinos could excel in modern intellectual endeavors and deserved equal treatment in the international community[^132]. Luna's participation in the Propaganda Movement, his editorship of La Solidaridad, and his scientific publications collectively challenged racist assumptions about Filipino intellectual inferiority that justified colonial domination[^133]. From this perspective, Luna's entire career—from scientist to propagandist to general—represented an assertion of Filipino capability and dignity against colonial denigration[^134].

### Negative Views

Critics of Antonio Luna emphasize his violent temperament, political incompetence, and the counterproductive nature of his confrontational approach to military and political leadership. Historical assessments noting that Luna "never won any battle" during the Philippine-American War challenge heroic narratives about his military brilliance[^135]. Skeptics argue that Luna's theoretical knowledge of military science, while impressive, did not translate into practical battlefield success, and his aggressive tactics sometimes unnecessarily exposed Filipino soldiers to superior American firepower without achieving strategic objectives[^136].

Luna's late entry into the revolutionary movement and his initial opposition to armed rebellion raised persistent questions about his commitment and opportunism. Contemporaries who had risked their lives fighting Spanish colonial forces since 1896 resented Luna's rapid promotion to supreme military command after he had "wasn't part of the Philippine Revolution and even went against the idea of it" during his years in Spain[^137]. This criticism suggests that Luna's transformation from peaceful reformist to military commander reflected personal ambition or family pressure rather than genuine revolutionary conviction[^138].

The controversy surrounding Luna's assassination continues to generate negative assessments of his political judgment and interpersonal skills. While the precise circumstances remain disputed, all historical accounts agree that Luna had alienated numerous Filipino officers and political leaders through his violent outbursts, public humiliations, and physical assaults[^139]. Critics argue that Luna's inability to navigate the political complexities of revolutionary government, his failure to build coalitions, and his tendency to create enemies unnecessarily demonstrated fundamental leadership deficiencies that no amount of military knowledge could compensate for[^140].

Apolinario Mabini's characterization of Luna as "a despot who didn't understand office work and the organization of the army" reflects contemporary criticisms that Luna's autocratic tendencies and lack of political finesse made him unsuitable for high command in a republican government[^141]. Luna's insistence on European-style military discipline and his attempts to centralize authority clashed with the more democratic, decentralized nature of the revolutionary forces and potentially undermined rather than strengthened the movement[^142]. Some historians suggest that Luna's vision of a professional army, while theoretically sound, was culturally inappropriate and practically unachievable given Philippine social structures and the circumstances of revolutionary warfare[^143].

Critics also emphasize the role of Luna's violent temperament in creating the conditions for his assassination. His physical assault on Felipe Buencamino in a cabinet meeting, his public humiliation of General Mascardo, and his disarming and arrest of the entire Kawit battalion demonstrated poor judgment and a dangerous inability to control his emotions[^144]. Rather than viewing Luna primarily as a victim of political intrigue, this interpretation holds him substantially responsible for his fate, arguing that his own actions made his assassination, if not inevitable, at least highly probable[^145].

Some Filipino historians, while acknowledging Luna's patriotism, question whether his contributions to the independence movement outweighed the damage caused by internal conflicts he provoked. The argument that Luna's assassination "did not directly contribute to the resulting fall of the Republic," advanced by historian Teodoro Agoncillo, suggests that Luna's significance may be overstated[^146]. This assessment implies that the fundamental military and political challenges facing the Philippines—overwhelming American military superiority, international diplomatic isolation, and internal political divisions—would have doomed the First Republic regardless of Luna's survival[^147].

Finally, critics note the irony that Luna, for all his emphasis on discipline and national unity, proved incapable of disciplining himself or uniting his fellow revolutionaries. His legacy, from this perspective, serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of inflexibility, the importance of emotional intelligence in leadership, and the need for revolutionary movements to balance military effectiveness with political cohesion[^148]. These negative assessments do not necessarily deny Luna's courage or patriotism but question whether his particular combination of brilliance and brutality ultimately helped or hindered the cause of Philippine independence[^149].
