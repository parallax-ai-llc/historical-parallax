## Summary

Peter Mansfield developed techniques that made MRI practical for clinical use, including echo-planar imaging (EPI) that dramatically reduced scan times. He was the first person to be placed inside an MRI machine. He shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Paul Lauterbur for their discoveries concerning MRI.
