## Summary

Joseph Karo was a rabbi and jurist who authored the Shulchan Aruch (Set Table), the most authoritative code of Jewish law. Originally from Spain, he settled in Safed in the Land of Israel after the expulsion. The Shulchan Aruch became the standard reference for Jewish legal practice across the Sephardic and later the Ashkenazi world. He was also a mystic who recorded his experiences with a heavenly mentor (maggid).
