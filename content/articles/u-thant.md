## Summary

U Thant was a Burmese diplomat and the third Secretary-General of the United Nations, serving from 1961 to 1971. He was the first non-European to hold this position and played a crucial role in mediating international conflicts during the height of the Cold War, including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Congo Crisis, and the Vietnam War. A devout Buddhist and committed internationalist, U Thant brought a unique philosophical perspective to global diplomacy that emphasized peaceful resolution of conflicts and decolonization. Despite facing criticism for his handling of certain crises and his inability to prevent major conflicts, he is remembered as a principled statesman who strengthened the moral authority of the United Nations during one of history's most dangerous periods.

## Early Life and Background

U Thant was born on January 22, 1909, in Pantanaw, a small town in the Irrawaddy Delta region of Burma (now Myanmar), which was then part of British India. He came from a well-educated family; his father, U Po Hnit, was a prosperous rice merchant who had received some Western education, while his mother, Nan Thaung, came from a family with strong Buddhist traditions[^1]. The name "U" is an honorific title in Burmese culture meaning "uncle" or denoting respect, while "Thant" means "clean" or "pure"[^2].

U Thant received his early education at the National High School in Pantanaw, where he proved to be an exceptional student with particular interests in history, literature, and philosophy. His education was deeply influenced by both Eastern and Western thought, studying Buddhist philosophy alongside English literature and European history[^3]. At the age of fourteen, his father passed away, forcing the young U Thant to take on greater responsibilities within his family while continuing his studies[^4].

In 1928, U Thant enrolled at University College in Rangoon (now Yangon), where he studied history and prepared for a Bachelor of Arts degree. However, financial difficulties forced him to leave university before completing his degree, a fact that he would later cite as one of his life's greatest regrets[^5]. Despite not obtaining his university degree, U Thant was remarkably well-read and intellectually curious, continuing his self-education throughout his life through voracious reading in philosophy, religion, international relations, and literature[^6].

After leaving university, U Thant returned to Pantanaw in 1931 to become a teacher and eventually headmaster of the National High School, the same institution where he had been educated. During his fifteen years as an educator, he gained a reputation as a dedicated and innovative teacher who emphasized critical thinking and moral education alongside traditional academic subjects[^7]. It was during this period that he developed many of the philosophical and ethical principles that would later guide his diplomatic career, particularly his commitment to Buddhist principles of compassion, non-violence, and the interconnectedness of all beings[^8].

U Thant's early life in colonial Burma also shaped his anti-colonial sentiments and his later commitment to decolonization. He witnessed firsthand the inequities of British colonial rule and became involved in Burma's independence movement, though he took a moderate, non-violent approach influenced by his Buddhist beliefs[^9]. He was a close friend and contemporary of several figures who would later lead independent Burma, including U Nu, who would become Burma's first Prime Minister and would play a pivotal role in launching U Thant's international career[^10].

## Rise to Power

U Thant's transition from provincial schoolteacher to international diplomat began with Burma's independence from Britain in 1948. His longtime friend U Nu became Prime Minister and appointed U Thant to a position in the government's Press and Information Department[^11]. This marked the beginning of U Thant's rapid ascent through Burma's diplomatic and civil service ranks, as his intelligence, integrity, and communication skills quickly became apparent to the new government's leadership[^12].

Between 1948 and 1957, U Thant held various positions in the Burmese government, including Director of Broadcasting, Secretary to the Government in the Ministry of Information, and Secretary for Projects in the Office of the Prime Minister[^13]. In these roles, he helped shape Burma's information policies and represented the country in various international forums. His work brought him into contact with international diplomats and UN officials, gradually building his reputation beyond Burma's borders[^14].

In 1957, U Thant's international career truly began when Prime Minister U Nu appointed him as Burma's Permanent Representative to the United Nations. In this capacity, U Thant demonstrated exceptional diplomatic skills and a talent for finding common ground among nations with divergent interests[^15]. He became known for his calm demeanor, principled approach to international relations, and ability to articulate the perspectives of newly independent Asian and African nations in the global forum[^16].

During his time as Burma's UN ambassador, U Thant served on numerous UN committees and bodies, gaining extensive knowledge of the organization's operations and building relationships with diplomats from around the world. He became particularly involved in issues related to decolonization, economic development, and disarmament—concerns that reflected both his personal values and the interests of the Non-Aligned Movement, with which Burma was associated[^17].

The sudden death of UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld in a plane crash in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) on September 18, 1961, created an unexpected opportunity for U Thant. The Cold War rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union had reached a critical point, and selecting a successor to Hammarskjöld proved extremely difficult[^18]. The Soviet Union had been calling for a "troika" system that would replace a single Secretary-General with a three-person directorate representing Western, Communist, and non-aligned nations—a proposal that Western powers adamantly opposed[^19].

In this deadlock, U Thant emerged as a compromise candidate acceptable to all parties. As a representative of a non-aligned nation with no colonial history and with demonstrated competence and integrity, he was seen as a neutral figure who could bridge the East-West divide[^20]. On November 3, 1961, the UN General Assembly unanimously appointed U Thant as Acting Secretary-General to complete Hammarskjöld's term. He was formally elected to a full five-year term on November 30, 1962, and was re-elected for another term in 1966, serving until December 31, 1971[^21].

U Thant's elevation to the UN's highest position was historic on multiple levels. He was the first Asian and the first person from a non-Western nation to serve as Secretary-General, marking a symbolic shift in global power dynamics as decolonization accelerated and the influence of the developing world grew[^22]. His appointment also represented a validation of the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and the idea that small nations could play meaningful roles in international affairs[^23].

## Major Achievements

U Thant's tenure as UN Secretary-General coincided with some of the most dangerous moments of the Cold War, and his diplomatic interventions are credited with helping to prevent several potential conflicts from escalating into major wars or nuclear confrontations[^24].

**Cuban Missile Crisis Mediation**: U Thant's most celebrated achievement came in October 1962, barely a year into his term, during the Cuban Missile Crisis. When American reconnaissance discovered Soviet nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war, U Thant took the unprecedented step of directly appealing to both President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev to suspend threatening actions and pursue negotiations[^25]. On October 24, 1962, he sent identical letters to both leaders urging a voluntary suspension of arms shipments to Cuba and a voluntary suspension of the U.S. naval quarantine for a period of two to three weeks to allow negotiations[^26]. While historians debate the extent of U Thant's influence on the crisis's resolution—with many crediting direct back-channel negotiations between Kennedy and Khrushchev as more decisive—his public intervention provided both superpowers with a face-saving framework for de-escalation and demonstrated the potential role of the UN in mediating between nuclear powers[^27].

**West New Guinea (West Irian) Dispute**: One of U Thant's most successful mediation efforts resolved the potentially explosive dispute between Indonesia and the Netherlands over West New Guinea (West Irian). The conflict threatened to escalate into open warfare and potentially draw in Cold War powers on opposite sides[^28]. Through patient diplomacy throughout 1962, U Thant brokered the New York Agreement of August 15, 1962, which provided for a UN Temporary Executive Authority to administer the territory before its transfer to Indonesia, with provisions for a future act of self-determination by the Papuan people[^29]. While the eventual "Act of Free Choice" in 1969 would be widely criticized as neither free nor representative, U Thant's mediation successfully prevented a war and demonstrated the UN's capacity to manage territorial disputes between member states[^30].

**Congo Crisis Management**: U Thant inherited the UN Operation in the Congo (ONUC), one of the organization's largest and most controversial peacekeeping missions. The Congo Crisis involved secessionist movements, Cold War proxy conflicts, and the assassination of Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba[^31]. U Thant took a more forceful approach than his predecessor, authorizing UN forces to use force if necessary to prevent civil war and to expel foreign mercenaries supporting the secessionist Katanga province[^32]. His decisive actions, particularly in authorizing military operations to end Katanga's secession in late 1962 and early 1963, successfully reunified the Congo and prevented it from becoming a proxy battlefield for the Cold War, though not without controversy over the UN's use of force[^33].

**Decolonization Advocacy**: As the first Secretary-General from the developing world, U Thant was a passionate advocate for decolonization and the rights of newly independent nations. He consistently used his position to pressure remaining colonial powers to grant independence to their colonies and to support the struggles of peoples under colonial rule[^34]. He was particularly vocal in his criticism of Portuguese colonialism in Africa and apartheid in South Africa, sometimes straining relations with Western powers who viewed him as too sympathetic to the developing world[^35]. Under his leadership, the UN expanded its membership dramatically as dozens of newly independent African and Asian nations joined the organization, fundamentally altering its composition and priorities[^36].

**Promoting Development and Human Rights**: U Thant championed the idea that peace and security were inseparable from economic development and social justice. He advocated for what would later be called the UN's "development agenda," arguing that poverty, inequality, and underdevelopment were threats to international peace[^37]. He supported the establishment of the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1964 and the adoption of the first UN Development Decade, initiatives aimed at addressing the economic disparities between developed and developing nations[^38]. He also strengthened the UN's work on human rights, though he was sometimes criticized for being too cautious in confronting powerful states over their human rights records[^39].

**Environmental Consciousness**: U Thant was ahead of his time in recognizing environmental degradation as a global concern requiring international cooperation. In 1969, he issued an influential statement warning that the world had perhaps ten years to address environmental problems before they reached a point of no return—an early articulation of what would later be called the climate crisis[^40]. He supported the convening of the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, which laid the groundwork for international environmental cooperation, though he had left office by the time the conference convened[^41].

**UN Peacekeeping Development**: Under U Thant's leadership, UN peacekeeping evolved from ad-hoc improvisation into a more systematic tool of conflict management. Beyond the Congo operation, he established or maintained peacekeeping missions in Cyprus (UNFICYP, established 1964), between India and Pakistan (UNIPOM, 1965-1966), and in the Middle East following the 1967 Six-Day War[^42]. While not all these missions were successful, they collectively established precedents and procedures that would shape UN peacekeeping for decades to come[^43].

**Administrative Reforms**: U Thant worked to make the UN Secretariat more representative of the organization's diverse membership, increasing the representation of Asian, African, and Latin American nationals in professional positions within the Secretariat[^44]. He also attempted to improve coordination between different UN agencies and bodies, though the UN's inherent structural complexities limited the scope of possible reforms[^45].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, U Thant's tenure as Secretary-General was marked by several significant controversies and perceived failures that damaged his reputation and highlighted the limitations of his diplomatic approach[^46].

**Six-Day War and UNEF Withdrawal**: U Thant's most damaging controversy involved the withdrawal of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) from the Sinai Peninsula in May 1967, shortly before the outbreak of the Six-Day War between Israel and Arab states. When Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser requested the removal of UN peacekeeping troops from Egyptian territory, U Thant complied without consulting the UN Security Council or attempting to delay or negotiate the withdrawal[^47]. The withdrawal removed a buffer between Egyptian and Israeli forces, and war erupted within weeks. Critics, particularly in Israel and the United States, accused U Thant of precipitously capitulating to Nasser's demands and facilitating the conditions for war[^48]. U Thant defended his decision by arguing that UNEF was stationed on Egyptian territory with Egypt's consent and that he had no legal authority to maintain UN forces on a member state's territory against its wishes—a position supported by UN legal experts but which many viewed as overly legalistic and politically naïve[^49]. The controversy haunted U Thant for the remainder of his tenure and is often cited as his greatest failure[^50].

**Vietnam War Stance**: U Thant's efforts to mediate the Vietnam War and his increasingly vocal criticism of American policy alienated the United States government and led to accusations that he had overstepped his role as an impartial international civil servant[^51]. As early as 1964, U Thant attempted to facilitate secret negotiations between the United States and North Vietnam, but these efforts were rebuffed by the Johnson administration, which did not make them public until years later[^52]. As the war escalated, U Thant became more openly critical of U.S. bombing campaigns and military strategy, calling for a halt to bombing North Vietnam and advocating for negotiations that would include the National Liberation Front (Viet Cong)[^53]. American officials, particularly in the Johnson administration, viewed U Thant's position as one-sided and unhelpful, effectively favoring North Vietnam's negotiating position[^54]. The tension reached a point where U.S. officials privately discussed whether to support U Thant's re-election in 1966, though they ultimately decided that opposing him would be counterproductive[^55].

**Bangladesh Crisis Inaction**: During the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War and the humanitarian catastrophe that accompanied Pakistan's military crackdown in East Pakistan, U Thant was criticized for the UN's ineffective response. Despite massive loss of life and millions of refugees fleeing to India, the UN took minimal action, largely because the issue was framed as an internal matter of a member state (Pakistan) and because Cold War politics paralyzed the Security Council[^56]. Critics argued that U Thant should have been more forceful in drawing international attention to the atrocities and advocating for humanitarian intervention, though such advocacy would have faced insurmountable opposition from Pakistan's allies, particularly the United States and China[^57].

**Biafra and Non-Intervention**: Similarly, during the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970) and the humanitarian crisis in breakaway Biafra, U Thant and the UN were criticized for inaction as hundreds of thousands died from starvation and conflict[^58]. U Thant maintained that the conflict was an internal Nigerian matter and that the UN could not intervene in a member state's internal affairs without Security Council authorization, which was not forthcoming[^59]. While this position was legally sound, critics argued it represented a failure of moral leadership and demonstrated the UN's—and U Thant's—inability to respond effectively to humanitarian catastrophes when they occurred within state borders[^60].

**Relations with Major Powers**: U Thant's tenure was marked by strained relationships with several major powers. The United States grew increasingly frustrated with his positions on Vietnam and what they perceived as anti-Western bias[^61]. The Soviet Union, while generally supportive of U Thant, occasionally criticized him when his positions conflicted with Soviet interests[^62]. France, under Charles de Gaulle, was generally dismissive of U Thant and the UN more broadly[^63]. China (represented by Taiwan in the UN until 1971) had a distant relationship with U Thant, who supported seating the People's Republic of China in the UN—a position that angered both Taiwan and the United States[^64].

**Administrative Challenges**: Despite his efforts at reform, U Thant was criticized for not adequately addressing bureaucratic inefficiency and corruption within the UN system. Some observers felt he was too passive in confronting underperforming staff or powerful member states that misused UN resources[^65]. His management style was consensus-oriented and non-confrontational, which sometimes meant that necessary but difficult decisions were postponed or avoided[^66].

**Alleged Anti-Israel Bias**: Beyond the UNEF withdrawal controversy, U Thant faced recurring accusations of anti-Israel bias. His statements on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were often perceived by Israel and its supporters as insufficiently supportive of Israel's security concerns and overly sympathetic to Arab positions[^67]. While U Thant maintained that he was simply applying UN resolutions and principles of international law, the perception of bias damaged his credibility in mediating Middle Eastern conflicts[^68].

**Resignation Consideration**: U Thant's frustrations with the limitations of his office and the criticisms he faced led him to seriously consider not seeking a second term in 1966. He was tired of the constant pressures, the inability to prevent major conflicts like Vietnam, and the attacks on his leadership[^69]. He was ultimately persuaded to accept re-election, but only for a single additional term, and he made clear that he would not serve beyond 1971, a decision that may have reduced his influence during his final years in office[^70].

## Personal Life

U Thant married Daw Thein Tin in 1934, and their marriage lasted until his death in 1974. She was a supportive partner throughout his career, though she maintained a low public profile and preferred to stay out of the diplomatic spotlight[^71]. The couple had three children: a son, Maung Bo, and two daughters, Aye Aye and Than Than[^72]. U Thant was known as a devoted family man who, despite the enormous demands of his position, tried to maintain connections with his family and his Burmese roots[^73].

Those who knew U Thant personally consistently described him as gentle, modest, and deeply principled. He lived simply, maintaining relatively modest living quarters despite his high office, and was known for his accessibility to UN staff at all levels[^74]. Unlike many diplomats, he was not given to grand gestures or dramatic speeches; instead, his style was understated and contemplative, preferring careful deliberation to quick reactions[^75].

U Thant's Buddhist faith was central to his identity and informed his approach to international relations. He was a practicing Buddhist who meditated daily and studied Buddhist philosophy throughout his life[^76]. His Buddhism shaped his commitment to non-violence, his emphasis on dialogue over confrontation, and his holistic view of peace as encompassing not just the absence of war but also social justice, economic development, and environmental harmony[^77]. He frequently invoked Buddhist concepts in his speeches and writings, attempting to bridge Eastern and Western philosophical traditions in his articulation of universal principles[^78].

An intellectual throughout his life, U Thant was an avid reader with an extensive personal library covering philosophy, religion, history, and literature from multiple cultural traditions[^79]. He wrote several books, including "Toward World Peace" (1964), "Portfolio for Peace" (1968), and his memoirs, "View from the UN" (1978, published posthumously)[^80]. His writings reflect his conviction that peace is achievable through reason, dialogue, and moral commitment, though they also reveal a degree of disillusionment with the gap between the UN's ideals and the realities of power politics[^81].

U Thant maintained a strong connection to Burma throughout his years at the UN, returning when possible and following developments in his homeland with great interest and some concern. He was distressed by the military coup that toppled his friend U Nu's government in 1962 and brought General Ne Win to power, though as UN Secretary-General, he could not publicly criticize Burma's government without compromising his position[^82]. His relationship with Burma's military government was complex; while they took pride in his international stature, they were sometimes uncomfortable with his liberal internationalist views and his associations with U Nu and civilian politicians[^83].

Despite spending his final decade in New York, U Thant never fully assimilated to Western culture. He continued to wear Burmese dress when appropriate, maintained Burmese cultural practices, and surrounded himself with reminders of his homeland[^84]. This cultural groundedness was both a strength—it gave him an authentic non-Western perspective—and occasionally a source of misunderstanding with Western diplomats more accustomed to European diplomatic traditions[^85].

U Thant's health declined in his final years. He retired from the UN at the end of 1971, exhausted by a decade of intense pressures and disappointed by his inability to end the Vietnam War or prevent other major conflicts[^86]. He returned to New York after his retirement and lived quietly, declining most offers for new positions or public engagements[^87]. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1974 and died in New York on November 25, 1974, at the age of 65[^88].

## Legacy

U Thant's death sparked an unexpected crisis that ironically secured his lasting legacy in Burma. When his body was returned to Rangoon, Burma's military government, which had an ambivalent relationship with U Thant, planned only a modest state funeral. This perceived disrespect to Burma's most internationally prominent citizen triggered massive student-led protests demanding a proper tribute[^89]. Students seized U Thant's coffin and held it at Rangoon University, demanding he be buried at the Shwedagon Pagoda or at the university grounds, not at an ordinary cemetery as the government had planned[^90]. The military government responded brutally, raiding the university, retaking the body, and suppressing the demonstrations with deadly force[^91]. The "U Thant Crisis" of December 1974 became a significant moment in Burma's history, representing growing opposition to military rule and helping to inspire future democratic movements[^92]. U Thant was ultimately buried at the foot of Shwedagon Pagoda in a specially constructed mausoleum, where his tomb remains a site of respect for many Burmese people[^93].

On the international stage, U Thant's legacy is mixed but ultimately significant. He is remembered as a transitional figure who helped reshape the UN from a Western-dominated organization into one more representative of global diversity[^94]. His tenure marked the institutionalization of the developing world's voice in international affairs and the legitimization of anti-colonial and non-aligned perspectives in global diplomacy[^95].

U Thant's contribution to preventing the Cold War from turning hot, while impossible to quantify precisely, was meaningful. His interventions in the Cuban Missile Crisis, the West Irian dispute, and the Congo Crisis demonstrated that patient diplomacy and principled mediation could make a difference even in an era of superpower rivalry[^96]. While he could not prevent the Vietnam War or the conflicts in the Middle East, Biafra, and Bangladesh, his efforts kept the UN relevant and maintained channels of communication during some of history's most dangerous moments[^97].

His emphasis on connecting peace with development, human rights, and environmental sustainability anticipated many of the UN's later priorities and helped establish the conceptual framework for the UN's multidimensional approach to peace and security[^98]. The notion that the Secretary-General should be a moral voice on global issues, not merely an administrative functionary, was strengthened during his tenure, though this role remained constrained by political realities[^99].

U Thant's Buddhist approach to international relations—his emphasis on compassion, interconnection, and non-violence—offered an alternative to Western realist frameworks that dominated Cold War strategic thinking. While this philosophical approach sometimes frustrated Western powers who saw it as naïve, it resonated with many in the developing world and contributed to alternative conceptions of global order[^100].

The limitations of U Thant's tenure also became part of his legacy, highlighting the structural constraints on the UN Secretary-General's power. His inability to prevent major conflicts, his legal scrupulousness that sometimes prevented bold action, and his difficulties in managing relationships with major powers all underscored that the UN could only be as effective as its member states allowed it to be[^101]. This reality has shaped expectations for subsequent Secretaries-General and ongoing debates about UN reform[^102].

In Burma/Myanmar, U Thant remains one of the country's most internationally respected figures, a symbol of a different era when Burma played a more prominent role in international affairs. Democratic activists have often invoked his legacy, seeing in him a representative of the country's more cosmopolitan and engaged past[^103]. The current military regime in Myanmar has a more complicated relationship with his memory, honoring him as a national figure while being uncomfortable with the democratic ideals he represented[^104].

U Thant's written works continue to be studied by scholars of international relations, Buddhist philosophy, and UN history. His articulation of a Buddhist approach to global affairs remains relevant to contemporary discussions about alternative frameworks for international relations beyond Western-dominated paradigms[^105].

Several institutions bear U Thant's name, including the U Thant House at the United Nations International School, the U Thant Library in Yangon, and various awards and lectures named in his honor. These institutional legacies keep his memory alive and associate his name with education, internationalism, and public service[^106].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and diplomats sympathetic to U Thant emphasize his moral courage and principled approach to international relations during an extraordinarily difficult period. Historian Brian Urquhart, who worked closely with U Thant at the UN, described him as "a man of deep principle and courage who was ahead of his time in his concerns about peace, development, human rights, and the environment"[^107]. Urquhart and others argue that U Thant's perceived failures were primarily due to the structural limitations of the UN and the intransigence of member states, not to personal inadequacy[^108].

Supporters emphasize that U Thant's role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, while perhaps not decisive, provided both superpowers with a face-saving mechanism for de-escalation and demonstrated the potential value of UN mediation in nuclear-age diplomacy[^109]. They note that his immediate intervention—sending letters to Kennedy and Khrushchev within days of the crisis emerging—showed initiative and courage that exceeded what might be expected from a Secretary-General of a recently decolonized nation mediating between nuclear superpowers[^110].

U Thant's advocacy for decolonization is viewed by postcolonial scholars as a significant contribution to the liberation of colonized peoples and the dismantling of colonial systems. His willingness to criticize Western powers over issues like Portuguese colonialism and apartheid—even at the cost of straining relationships—represented a departure from the more cautious approach of his European predecessors and validated the perspectives of the global South[^111]. Scholar Ramesh Thakur argues that U Thant "helped legitimize the concerns of the developing world and ensured that the UN would be an organization representing all nations, not just the powerful"[^112].

His early warnings about environmental degradation and his insistence on linking peace with development and social justice are now seen as prescient by scholars studying the evolution of global governance concepts. Environmental historian Paul Wapner credits U Thant with helping to place environmental issues on the international agenda at a time when few political leaders recognized their importance[^113].

Buddhist scholars and practitioners appreciate U Thant's articulation of a Buddhist approach to international affairs and his demonstration that non-Western philosophical traditions could inform global governance. Scholar Sallie B. King argues that U Thant showed how "Buddhist principles of compassion, interdependence, and non-violence could be applied to real-world political problems," providing a model for engaged Buddhism that transcended national boundaries[^114].

Diplomats from developing countries often speak of U Thant with respect and affection, viewing him as someone who understood their perspectives and advocated for their interests at a time when they had limited voice in international affairs. His emphasis on sovereignty and non-intervention, while sometimes criticized, resonated with newly independent nations sensitive about their hard-won independence and wary of great power interference[^115].

Defenders of U Thant's position on the UNEF withdrawal argue that he made the only legally and politically tenable decision available to him. Legal scholar Rosalyn Higgins notes that UNEF was stationed on Egyptian territory with Egypt's consent and that no legal basis existed for maintaining UN forces against the wishes of the host state[^116]. Some analysts suggest that focusing on U Thant's decision obscures the deeper failures of diplomacy and the intransigence of the parties to the Arab-Israeli conflict[^117].

---

### Negative Views

Critics of U Thant argue that he was fundamentally unsuited for the role of Secretary-General during the Cold War, lacking the political acumen, forcefulness, and creativity required to navigate superpower politics effectively. Political scientist Inis Claude Jr. argued that U Thant "too often confused legalistic correctness with political wisdom" and that his passive approach allowed opportunities for effective UN action to slip away[^118].

The UNEF withdrawal remains the focal point of criticism. Scholars such as Michael Brecher argue that U Thant could and should have delayed the withdrawal, consulted more broadly with UN members, sought Security Council guidance, or at minimum attempted to negotiate conditions for withdrawal that might have preserved a UN presence or provided more time for diplomacy[^119]. Critics contend that his rapid compliance with Nasser's demand—UNEF began withdrawing within 48 hours of the request—showed poor judgment and possibly reflected his own political biases in favor of Arab nationalism[^120].

U Thant's handling of the Vietnam War is viewed by many American scholars and policymakers as partisan and counterproductive. Historian Robert Schulzinger argues that U Thant's public criticism of American policy "undermined his credibility as a neutral mediator and ensured that the Johnson administration would not take his mediation efforts seriously"[^121]. Critics note that while he was vocal in criticizing American bombing, he was relatively quiet about North Vietnamese infiltration and attacks, creating an appearance of one-sidedness[^122].

Some scholars argue that U Thant's commitment to non-intervention and state sovereignty was taken to extremes that prevented effective humanitarian action. The UN's passivity during the Bangladesh crisis and the Biafran famine are cited as examples where legal formalism trumped moral imperative[^123]. Political theorist Michael Walzer argued that U Thant's interpretation of non-intervention principles "represented an abdication of moral responsibility in the face of mass atrocities"[^124].

Critics from the perspective of realist international relations theory argue that U Thant's idealistic, moralistic approach to diplomacy was naive and ineffective in a world governed by power politics. Political scientist Hans Morgenthau suggested that U Thant's Buddhist philosophy, while admirable in personal ethics, was "fundamentally incompatible with the requirements of effective diplomacy in an anarchic international system"[^125].

Israeli historians and diplomats remain highly critical of U Thant, viewing him as biased against Israel and insufficiently attentive to Israeli security concerns. The UNEF withdrawal is seen as the most egregious example, but his broader approach to the Arab-Israeli conflict is criticized as favoring Arab positions[^126]. Historian Michael Oren characterizes U Thant as "consistently hostile to Israeli interests and blind to Arab aggression"[^127].

Administrative critics argue that U Thant failed to adequately reform the UN Secretariat or address its growing inefficiencies. Former UN official Shirley Hazzard wrote critically of the organization's bureaucratic culture and argued that U Thant's gentle management style allowed mediocrity and corruption to flourish[^128]. Some observers felt that he was too accommodating of political appointees from member states who were often more loyal to their home governments than to the UN's mission[^129].

Some analysts argue that U Thant's tenure represented a missed opportunity to strengthen the UN during a critical period. His reluctance to challenge powerful states, his legal caution, and his avoidance of confrontation meant that precedents that might have expanded the Secretary-General's authority or enhanced the UN's effectiveness were not established[^130]. Political scientist Thomas Franck suggests that "a more creative and assertive Secretary-General might have used the tensions of the Cold War to carve out greater space for UN action"[^131].
