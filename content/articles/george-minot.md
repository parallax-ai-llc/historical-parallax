## Summary

George Minot shared the 1934 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that liver extract could treat pernicious anemia, previously a fatal disease. Working with William Murphy and George Whipple, he demonstrated that a substance in liver (later identified as vitamin B12) was curative. His work saved thousands of lives from this once-deadly condition.
