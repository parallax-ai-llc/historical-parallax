## Summary

Édouard Manet (1832-1883) was a French painter widely considered the founding father of modernism and a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.[^1] Born into an affluent Parisian family, Manet shocked the art establishment with controversial masterworks like *Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe* (1863) and *Olympia* (1865), which challenged academic conventions and depicted modern urban life with unprecedented directness.[^2] Though closely associated with the Impressionists, Manet maintained his independence, refusing to exhibit with the group while profoundly influencing their development.[^3] His technical innovations—including bold flatness, loose brushwork, and stark contrasts—paved the way for generations of modern artists, establishing him as one of the most influential painters in art history.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Édouard Manet was born in Paris on January 23, 1832, in the ancestral hôtel particulier (mansion) on the Rue des Petits Augustins (now Rue Bonaparte) to an affluent and well-connected family.[^5] His father, Auguste Manet, served as the chief of personnel at the Ministry of Justice and was a reputable judge, while his mother, Eugénie-Désirée Fournier, was of royal ancestry and the daughter of a diplomat and goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince Charles Bernadotte.[^6] Along with his two younger brothers, Manet grew up in a bourgeois environment, both socially conservative and financially comfortable, which afforded him considerable social and cultural advantages.[^7]

From 1839, Manet was a day pupil at Canon Poiloup's school in Vaugirard, where he studied French and the classics.[^8] From 1844 to 1848, he was a boarder at the Collège Rollin, then located near the Panthéon.[^9] A poor student academically, young Édouard was interested only in the special drawing course offered by the school.[^10] His uncle, Charles Fournier, recognized his nephew's artistic inclinations and encouraged him to pursue painting, often taking young Manet to the Louvre to study the Old Masters.[^11] This early exposure to masterworks would prove formative in developing his artistic vision.

Although his father wanted him to enroll in law school to follow a respectable bourgeois career, Édouard could not be persuaded to do so.[^12] When his father refused to allow him to become a painter, the young Manet applied for the naval college but failed the entrance examination.[^13] At his father's suggestion, in 1848 he sailed on a training vessel to Rio de Janeiro on the ship Havre et Guadeloupe, voyaging between December 1848 and June 1849.[^14] After he twice failed the examination to join the Navy, his father finally relented to his wishes to pursue an art education.[^15]

From 1850 to 1856, Manet studied under the academic painter Thomas Couture, enduring six years of rigorous traditional training.[^16] However, the relationship was often contentious, as Manet chafed against Couture's conservative academic methods. In his spare time, Manet copied Old Masters such as Diego Velázquez and Titian in the Louvre, developing a deep appreciation for their technical mastery and painterly techniques.[^17] From 1853 to 1856, Manet made brief visits to Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he was influenced by the Dutch painter Frans Hals and the Spanish artists Velázquez and Francisco José de Goya, whose bold brushwork and dramatic contrasts would profoundly shape his mature style.[^18] In 1856, at age 24, Manet opened his own studio, signaling his readiness to embark on an independent artistic career.[^19]

## Rise to Prominence

Manet's path to prominence was marked by controversy, rejection, and gradual recognition as a revolutionary force in art. In 1859, Manet submitted his first work to the Paris Salon, *The Absinthe Drinker*, which was rejected by the jury—a harbinger of the establishment's resistance to his unconventional approach.[^20] However, in 1861, Manet achieved his first Salon success when *The Spanish Singer* was accepted and admired by Théophile Gautier, being placed in a more conspicuous location as a result of its popularity with Salon-goers.[^21] According to one contemporary source, *The Spanish Singer*, painted in a "strange new fashion[,] caused many painters' eyes to open and their jaws to drop."[^22]

The year 1862 marked a pivotal moment when Manet exhibited *Music in the Tuileries* (probably painted in 1860), one of his first masterpieces.[^23] With its portrayal of a crowd of subjects at the Jardin des Tuileries, the painting shows the outdoor leisure of contemporary Paris, which would be a lifelong subject of Manet's.[^24] Among the figures in the gardens are the poet Charles Baudelaire, the musician Jacques Offenbach, and others of Manet's family and friends, including a self-portrait of the artist.[^25] *Music in the Tuileries* received substantial critical and public attention, most of it negative.[^26] In the words of one Manet biographer, "it is difficult for us to imagine the kind of fury *Music in the Tuileries* provoked when it was exhibited."[^27] The public, accustomed to the finely detailed brushwork of historical painters such as Ernest Meissonier, thought Manet's thick brushstrokes looked crude and unfinished.[^28] Angered by the subject matter and technique, several visitors even threatened to destroy the painting.[^29]

The defining moment of Manet's career came in 1863, when the Salon jury rejected his monumental *Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe* (Luncheon on the Grass).[^30] Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit this and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés, where the painting sparked public notoriety and controversy.[^31] The painting's controversy stemmed from several factors: it depicts a nude woman and a scantily dressed bathing woman on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting.[^32] The rejection was occasioned not so much by the female nudes in Manet's painting, a classical subject, as by their presence in a modern setting, accompanied by clothed, bourgeois men.[^33] The incongruity suggested that the women were not goddesses but models, or possibly prostitutes.[^34] The Realist style of the mise en scène, or material setting and decor, in both form and content, caused controversy because Manet was symbolically rejecting the accepted standards of classical beauty and traditional form established by the Academy.[^35]

Two years later, in 1865, Manet's *Olympia* stirred an even bigger uproar when it was first exhibited at the Paris Salon.[^36] Conservatives condemned the work as "immoral" and "vulgar."[^37] Journalist Antonin Proust later recalled, "If the canvas of the *Olympia* was not destroyed, it is only because of the precautions that were taken by the administration."[^38] *Olympia*'s confrontational gaze caused shock and controversy, especially because a number of details in the picture identified her as a prostitute.[^39] Women working as 'demi-mondaines' were rife across 19th century Paris, but they performed a secret practice that no one talked about, and it was extremely rare for an artist to represent it in such a flagrantly direct way.[^40] Manet also bucked the trend for a softly focused, romanticized finish, painting instead with stark flat shapes and a high contrast color scheme.[^41]

Despite the scandals, these early masterworks were soon praised by progressive artists as the breakthrough acts to the new style, Impressionism, and are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art.[^42]

## Major Achievements

Manet's artistic achievements revolutionized painting and established him as one of the most influential artists of the 19th century. His known extant works comprise 430 oil paintings, 89 pastels, and more than 400 works on paper.[^43] Beyond *Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe* and *Olympia*, Manet created numerous masterworks that challenged convention and explored modern urban life.

Between 1867 and 1869, Manet produced a series of monumental paintings depicting *The Execution of Emperor Maximilian*, which showed the execution by firing squad of Emperor Maximilian I of the short-lived Second Mexican Empire.[^44] Emperor Maximilian was executed by a firing squad of Benito Juárez's army at Querétaro, north of Mexico City, on June 19, 1867.[^45] Manet was outraged by the death of Maximilian, who was widely viewed as a victim of Napoleon III's political ambition and incompetence, and decided the execution merited artistic treatment on an epic scale.[^46] Manet produced three large oil paintings, a smaller oil sketch and a lithograph of the same subject.[^47] Neither the paintings nor the lithograph were permitted to be shown in France, demonstrating the political censorship that confronted even established artists.[^48]

In 1868-69, Manet painted *The Balcony* (Le balcon), which depicts four figures on a balcony, one of whom is sitting: the painter Berthe Morisot, who married Manet's brother Eugène in 1874.[^49] In the centre is the painter Jean Baptiste Antoine Guillemet, and on the right is Fanny Claus, a violinist.[^50] The painting, inspired by Goya's *Majas on the Balcony*, was created at the same time and with the same purpose as *Luncheon in the Studio*.[^51] The vividness of the colours—the green of the balustrade and shutters, the blue of the man's tie, as well as the brutal contrast between the white dresses and the darkness of the background—were perceived as provocation.[^52] The hierarchy usually attached to human figures and objects has been disregarded: the flowers receiving more detail than some of the faces.[^53]

In 1874, Manet and Claude Monet spent time together painting at Argenteuil on the Seine, and his works 'Argenteuil' and 'The Railway Station' were shown in the Paris Salon.[^54] This period marked Manet's increasing engagement with Impressionist techniques, though he maintained his independence from the movement. In 1877, Manet completed *Nana*, which was refused at the Salon of Paris the same year.[^55] Manet decided to show his painting in the window of a shop on the Boulevard des Capucines, one of Paris's main streets.[^56] The model for the painting was Henriette Hauser, a well-known courtesan of the era.[^57] French society was not prepared for such frank depictions of prostitution, and the critics did not see the artistic qualities of the work and concentrated solely on the scene which was represented.[^58]

Manet also created remarkable still lifes in his later years, including small-scale works of fruits and vegetables, such as *A Bunch of Asparagus* and *The Lemon* (both 1880), as well as *Plum Brandy* (1877), one of his major works.[^59] He completed his last major work, *A Bar at the Folies-Bergère* (*Un Bar aux Folies-Bergère*), in 1882, and it hung in the Salon that year.[^60] This celebrated work depicts a scene in the Folies Bergère nightclub in Paris and is now in the Courtauld Gallery in London.[^61] The painting shows a barmaid named Suzon standing behind a marble counter with bottles of beverages, with the background showing a fashionable crowd mingling on the balcony, entertained by musical and circus acts below.[^62] In the top left, a trapeze artist in green boots adds to the excitement.[^63] Ignoring normal perspective, Manet has shifted their reflection to the right, creating a deliberate spatial ambiguity.[^64]

In 1881, Manet was awarded the prestigious Légion d'Honneur, representing official recognition of his contributions to French art.[^65] His style in his mature period was characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details, and the suppression of transitional tones.[^66] Rather than build up colors in layers, Manet would immediately lay down the hue that most closely matched the final effect he sought.[^67] The approach came to be used widely by the Impressionists, who found it perfectly suited to the pressures of capturing effects of light and atmosphere whilst painting outdoors.[^68] His loose handling of paint, and his schematic rendering of volumes, led to areas of "flatness" in his pictures, which today critics see as the first example of "flatness" in modern art.[^69]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Throughout his career, Manet endured relentless criticism from the academic art establishment and conservative critics who found his work shocking, immoral, and technically incompetent. Manet was driven to scandalize the French Salon public with his disregard for academic conventions and his strikingly modern images of urban life.[^70] He was ostracized and criticized by the established French Academy and the rest of the ultra-conservative art world for his preference to paint realistic artworks which featured scenes taken out of ordinary life.[^71]

Critics ruthlessly attacked Manet's painting style. Regarding *Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe*, one critic stated that the brushwork appeared to have been done with a "floor mop."[^72] When *Olympia* was revealed in 1865, the reception was so negative that Manet complained to his friend, writer and poet Charles Baudelaire, that all of Paris was, "raining insults upon me!"[^73] Critics described Olympia with harsh language, calling her "cadaverous," and that "she does not have a human form," with one critic remarking the figure "has the livid tint of a cadaver displayed at the morgue."[^74]

Manet's submissions to the Salon of 1864 were again condemned by critics, who found errors of perspective in his *Incident at a Bullfight* and a lack of decorum in *The Dead Christ with Angels*.[^75] When *A Bar at the Folies-Bergère* was exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874, "Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy."[^76] Critics complained that paintings looked unfinished, that the modeling was crude, and that the colors were harsh and unnatural.[^77] Manet's harsh contrasts of light and dark, his bold simplification of forms, and his visible brushwork all violated academic standards.[^78]

The emotional toll of this sustained criticism was devastating. Manet himself acknowledged the psychological damage when he stated: "The attacks of which I have been the object have broken the spring of life in me... People don't realize what it feels like to be constantly insulted."[^79] This admission reveals the profound personal cost of his artistic rebellion and the courage required to maintain his vision in the face of overwhelming hostility.

Beyond technical criticisms, Manet faced moral condemnation for his subject matter. His frank depictions of prostitution, modern urban leisure, and contemporary life were deemed inappropriate for serious art. The repeated rejection of his works from the Salon, and the censorship of his *Execution of Maximilian* series for political reasons, demonstrate the multiple forms of resistance he encountered from the establishment.[^80]

Despite insisting that "One must be of one's time and paint what one sees,"[^81] Manet's commitment to this principle resulted in decades of professional struggle, public ridicule, and personal anguish that only began to ease toward the very end of his life.

## Personal Life

In 1851, Suzanne Leenhoff was initially hired by Manet's father, Auguste, as a piano teacher for Édouard and his brothers.[^82] Leenhoff was a Dutch-born piano teacher two years Manet's senior with whom he had been romantically involved for approximately ten years.[^83] In their early twenties, Suzanne and Édouard developed a personal relationship and were romantically involved for some ten years.[^84] After Édouard left his parents' home, he and Suzanne lived together, although they kept their relationship discreet and secret, especially from Édouard's father.[^85]

Leenhoff gave birth out of wedlock to a son, Léon-Edouard Koëlla, on January 29, 1852.[^86] The birth certificate gave Leenhoff as the mother but "Koëlla" as the father, an individual never identified and likely invented.[^87] Her son, Leon Leenhoff, whose father may have been either of the Manets, posed often for Manet.[^88] There remains speculation about whether Édouard or his father Auguste was the biological father, a mystery that has never been definitively resolved.[^89]

After the death of his father in 1862, Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff in 1863 at a Protestant church.[^90] After more than a decade of companionship, Édouard and Suzanne married on October 28, 1863, in a modest ceremony.[^91] Suzanne's role in Manet's life extended beyond that of a spouse. She became his emotional anchor, providing support as he faced harsh criticism from the public and the art establishment.[^92] Her unwavering presence allowed him to focus on his work and continue pushing artistic boundaries.[^93] Baudelaire wrote to a mutual friend that Manet's new wife was reportedly "beautiful, very kind, and a very great artist."[^94] Suzanne frequently modeled for her husband, and Manet painted his wife's portrait at least thirteen times.[^95]

Manet also led a bohemian life and moved in sophisticated artistic and literary circles.[^96] One of the most significant relationships in his life was his artistic friendship with Berthe Morisot. Theirs was arguably the closest relationship between any two members of the Impressionist circle, unfolding over a period of roughly 15 years between 1868 and 1883.[^97] Morisot was copying masterworks at the Louvre in Paris in 1868, when a mutual friend, the painter Henri Fantin-Latour, introduced her to Manet, nine years her senior.[^98] She began posing that fall for his painting *The Balcony* (1868–69), and would sit for at least 10 more canvases over the next five years.[^99] Manet praised and encouraged Morisot's early work, and he kept three of her works in his bedroom.[^100]

The pair had an intense relationship and were possibly lovers.[^101] Morisot hinted at the possibility in a letter to her sister, writing: "Manet teases me incessantly, makes fun of my manners, and I end up finding that, if he were free, I'd be much likelier to fancy him than anyone else".[^102] When she married Manet's younger brother Eugène in 1874, their professional connection deepened into a familial bond.[^103] By the final years of his life, Manet increasingly followed Morisot's example—her choice of subjects and colors, and even her rapid, fluttering brushstrokes.[^104] The relationship between Manet and Morisot really is the single closest relationship between any two members of the broader Impressionist circle, with each of these two artists profoundly influencing the other.[^105]

## Legacy

Édouard Manet's legacy as the founding father of modernism remains secure more than a century after his death.[^106] His works are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of modern art, and his influence on subsequent generations of artists is immeasurable.[^107] Manet was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, as well as a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.[^108] While he had gained a reputation as an influential innovator during his lifetime, only posthumously would he be recognized as a father of modern art.[^109]

Manet's technical innovations fundamentally changed how artists approached painting. He rejected traditional painting techniques in favor of a direct, alla prima method using opaque paint on a light ground, which was adopted by the Impressionists, and became the prevalent method of painting in oils for generations that followed.[^110] Manet's work is considered "early modern", partially because of the opaque flatness of his surfaces, the frequent sketch-like passages, and the black outlining of figures, all of which draw attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint.[^111] Manet's disregard for traditional modeling and perspective made a critical break with academic painting's historical emphasis on illusionism.[^112] This flaunting of tradition and the official art establishment paved the way for the revolutionary work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists.[^113] His ability to renounce standards and traditions upheld by the Academy for centuries laid the foundation of artistic rebellion for decades and generations of artists to come.[^114]

Manet also influenced the path of much 19th- and 20th-century art through his choice of subject matter. His focus on modern, urban subjects—which he presented in a straightforward, almost detached manner—distinguished him still more from the standards of the Salon.[^115] Édouard Manet was the most important and influential artist to have heeded poet Charles Baudelaire's call to artists to become painters of modern life.[^116] His influence on the Impressionists and subsequent modern movements established him as the father of modern painting, while his technical innovations and psychological insights ensure his continued relevance for contemporary artists and viewers.[^117]

Manet's influence can be seen in the work of artists as diverse as David Hockney, Alex Katz, and Kerry James Marshall, all of whom have acknowledged their debt to his pioneering achievements.[^118] The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him develop his own simple and direct style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.[^119] His influence on the course of art history is immeasurable, as he directly paved the way for Impressionism, liberating color and brushwork from academic constraint, with Degas, Monet, and Renoir all looking to him as a leader.[^120]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Art historians and scholars have consistently recognized Manet's revolutionary contributions to modern art. Art historian Beatrice Farwell believes Manet "has long been considered as the Godfather of Modernism."[^121] Farwell notes that Manet was one of the first to take considerable chances with the public's approval, the first to make alla prima artwork the normal method for painting with oils, and among the first to experiment with the Renaissance viewpoint.[^122] Many art historians consider Manet to be the father of modern art, with his influence on modernism being immeasurable.[^123]

Formalist critics like Clement Greenberg celebrated Manet for his assertion of the flatness of the canvas, viewing him as the first truly modern painter who prioritized the medium over the subject.[^124] This interpretation emphasizes Manet's technical innovations and his role in establishing painting as an autonomous art form concerned with its own material properties. Contemporary scholars continue to recognize that to this day, Manet is still considered by many art historians to be the father of modernism.[^125]

Social art historians, most notably T.J. Clark, re-contextualized Manet's work within the socio-economic realities of Second Empire Paris, arguing that the "flatness" and "incompleteness" of Manet's paintings were ideological expressions of the ambiguities and alienations of modern class society.[^126] This interpretation views Manet not merely as a formal innovator, but as an acute observer and critic of modern urban life and its discontents.

Museums and cultural institutions have consistently celebrated Manet's achievements. The Musée d'Orsay in Paris organized a major exhibition titled "Manet, the Man who Invented Modernity," positioning him as the singular figure who transformed Western art.[^127] His paintings command the highest respect in major museums worldwide, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery in London, and the Courtauld Gallery, which houses his masterpiece *A Bar at the Folies-Bergère*.[^128]

### Negative Views

Despite his canonical status today, Manet faced sustained criticism during his lifetime that extended beyond mere conservative resistance to innovation. Many contemporary critics genuinely believed his technical approach was fundamentally flawed. They argued that his flat surfaces, harsh contrasts, and visible brushwork represented not bold innovation but incompetence or laziness.[^129] The criticism that his paintings appeared "unfinished" reflected a deeply held belief among academic painters and critics that proper painting required careful modeling, smooth transitions, and illusionistic depth.[^130]

Some critics viewed Manet's subject matter as not merely shocking but morally corrosive. His frank depictions of prostitution, particularly in *Olympia* and *Nana*, were condemned as vulgar and inappropriate for serious art.[^131] Conservative voices argued that art should elevate viewers through noble subjects, not confront them with the sordid realities of modern urban life. This moral criticism was not simply prudishness but reflected genuine philosophical disagreement about art's purpose in society.

Even among progressive artists and critics, Manet's relationship with Impressionism was contested. While the Impressionists admired his boldness, some questioned his refusal to join their independent exhibitions, viewing it as opportunistic fence-sitting.[^132] Manet declined invitations to participate in any of the seven exhibitions organized by the group, preferring to exhibit at the Salon despite its frequent rejection of his work.[^133] Some interpreted this as vanity or a desire for establishment recognition that contradicted his revolutionary image.

Modern revisionist scholars have raised questions about Manet's representation of women, particularly his repeated depictions of prostitutes and his objectifying male gaze.[^134] Feminist art historians have examined works like *Olympia* and *Nana* with more critical eyes, questioning whether Manet's frank depictions of sex workers constituted progressive social commentary or merely replicated the commodification of women's bodies. While some scholars celebrate *Olympia*'s confrontational gaze as empowering, others argue that the painting ultimately serves male voyeuristic pleasure.

Additionally, some critics have questioned the extent to which Manet deserves sole credit for innovations that were emerging more broadly in the artistic culture of 1860s Paris.[^135] His debt to Spanish painters like Velázquez and Goya, as well as to contemporary figures like Courbet, suggests that his "revolutionary" contributions may have been more evolutionary than his mythic status suggests. The complexity of Manet's achievement—neither purely innovative nor merely derivative—continues to generate scholarly debate.
