## Summary
Pol Pot was a Cambodian revolutionary and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia) from 1975 to 1979. Leading the Khmer Rouge, he imposed a totalitarian agrarian socialist regime that led to the Cambodian genocide, killing an estimated 1.5 to 2 million people.

## Reign of Terror
Under Pol Pot, Cambodia was transformed into a massive labor camp. Cities were emptied, money was abolished, and anyone suspected of being an intellectual or enemy of the state was executed in the infamous "Killing Fields"."
