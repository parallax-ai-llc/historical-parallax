## Summary

Pol Pot (born Saloth Sâr; May 19, 1925 – April 15, 1998) was a Cambodian revolutionary and politician who led the Khmer Rouge from 1963 to 1997 and served as Prime Minister of Democratic Kampuchea from 1976 to 1979. Under his leadership, Cambodia underwent one of the 20th century's most brutal genocides, resulting in the deaths of approximately 1.5 to 2 million people—nearly a quarter of Cambodia's population. His radical agrarian communist vision sought to transform Cambodia into a rural, classless society, leading to forced evacuations, mass executions, starvation, and disease. The Cambodian Genocide remains one of history's most devastating examples of ideological extremism and totalitarian control.
