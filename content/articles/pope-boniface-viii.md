## Summary

Pope Boniface VIII (born Benedetto Caetani, c. 1230-1303) was the head of the Catholic Church from 1294 until his death in 1303, and remains one of the most controversial figures in papal history.[^1] His pontificate was marked by his assertion of extreme papal supremacy over secular rulers, culminating in the famous bull *Unam Sanctam* (1302), which declared that submission to the pope was necessary for salvation.[^2] His bitter conflict with King Philip IV of France led to his kidnapping at Anagni in September 1303, an event that shocked medieval Christendom and from which he never recovered, dying a month later.[^3] Despite his controversial political actions, he made lasting contributions to canon law through the *Liber Sextus* (1298) and established the first Jubilee Year in 1300, which drew hundreds of thousands of pilgrims to Rome.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Benedetto Caetani was born around 1230-1235 in Anagni, a hill town approximately 50 kilometers southeast of Rome in the Papal States.[^5] He came from the Caetani (or Gaetani dell'Aquila) family, a baronial family with significant connections to ecclesiastical power.[^6] His father was Roffredo Caetani, who served as Podestà of Todi in 1274-1275, while his mother, Emilia Patrasso di Guarcino, was a niece of Pope Alexander IV, who was himself a nephew of Pope Gregory IX.[^7] This maternal connection placed young Benedetto within the orbit of papal power and patronage from birth.

His early education began at the monastery of the Friars Minor in Velletri, where he was placed under the care of his maternal uncle, Fra Leonardo Patrasso.[^8] Benedetto demonstrated exceptional intellectual abilities and pursued legal studies at several prestigious institutions. He began studying law at Todi, continued at Spoleto, and between 1263 and 1274 studied at the University of Bologna, the preeminent center for legal studies in medieval Christendom.[^9] He obtained doctorates in both canon and civil law, which would prove instrumental in his later career.[^10]

During his education, Benedetto also held canonries at various important churches, including Anagni, Todi, Paris, Lyons, and Rome, accumulating both ecclesiastical offices and income.[^11] This pattern of pluralism—holding multiple church benefices simultaneously—was common among ambitious clerics of noble birth in the medieval period. His legal training at Bologna was particularly significant, as the university was renowned for producing the finest canon lawyers in Europe, and this expertise would define much of his papal career.

In 1264, Benedetto received his first major ecclesiastical appointment when he joined Cardinal Simon of Brie's legation to France.[^12] The following year, in 1265, he accompanied Cardinal Ottoboni Fieschi (later Pope Adrian V) to England, where that prelate had been sent on a papal mission, likely remaining there until 1268.[^13] These diplomatic missions provided the young Caetani with invaluable experience in ecclesiastical politics and international relations, skills he would later employ during his tumultuous pontificate.

## Rise to Power

Benedetto Caetani's rise through the ecclesiastical hierarchy was methodical and impressive. In 1281, not yet ordained as a priest, he was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Martin IV as cardinal deacon of St. Nicholas in Carcere Tulliano.[^14] This appointment reflected both his family connections and his growing reputation as one of the most brilliant canon lawyers of his generation. His expertise in church law made him an invaluable advisor to successive popes on complex legal and diplomatic matters.

In 1290, Benedetto served as papal legate to France, further enhancing his diplomatic credentials and understanding of French politics—knowledge that would later prove both useful and ultimately tragic during his conflicts with the French crown.[^15] Finally, in 1291, after serving as a cardinal deacon for a decade, he was ordained as a priest and elevated to cardinal priest of St. Martin in Montibus.[^16]

The path to his papal election was both dramatic and controversial. Pope Celestine V, a saintly hermit who had been elected in July 1294 after a two-year conclave impasse, quickly proved wholly incompetent and unsuited for the demands of the papacy.[^17] Celestine expressed a desire to abdicate soon after his election, a virtually unprecedented move in church history.[^18] Cardinal Benedetto Caetani was among several cardinals who advised Celestine on the canonical questions surrounding papal abdication.[^19] According to contemporary accounts, Caetani showed that abdication was permitted by church law, though later critics would accuse him of manipulating the elderly hermit into resigning.[^20]

Before abdicating, Celestine issued a bull establishing the regulations concerning papal abdication.[^21] On December 13, 1294, at Naples, where he had established the papal court, Celestine formally resigned.[^22] The cardinals quickly convened a conclave at Castel Nuovo in Naples. On Christmas Eve, December 24, 1294, after only one day of deliberation, Cardinal Benedetto Caetani was elected pope with the required two-thirds majority and took the name Boniface VIII.[^23] This was the first papal conclave held during the lifetime of the preceding pontiff, a situation not repeated until 2013 when Pope Benedict XVI resigned.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### The Liber Sextus and Legal Reform

One of Boniface VIII's most enduring achievements was his comprehensive reform and codification of canon law. In 1296, he commissioned three experienced canonists—William Mandagout, Archbishop of Embrun; Bérenger Frédol, Bishop of Béziers; and Richard Petronio, the papal vice-chancellor—to compile a new collection of church law.[^25] The previous comprehensive collection, the *Decretales Gregorii IX*, had been published in 1234 under Pope Gregory IX, but in the succeeding sixty-four years, numerous papal and conciliar legal decisions had been made that required systematization.[^26]

The new collection was completed within two years and promulgated on March 3, 1298, as the *Liber Sextus* (Sixth Book), so named because it was intended as a sixth part to complement the five books of Gregory IX's decretals.[^27] The *Liber Sextus* contained papal decisions from the period between 1234 and 1294, including some eighty-eight of Boniface's own legal rulings.[^28] It also included a collection of legal principles known as the *Regulæ Juris*, consisting of eighty-eight rules of law borrowed from Roman law, probably compiled by Dino de' Rossoni, a professor of civil law at the University of Bologna.[^29]

The *Liber Sextus* was promulgated as an obligatory code of laws, abrogating all previous general laws enacted from the publication of Gregory IX's decretals until Boniface's election.[^30] It remained part of the official *Corpus Juris Canonici* until the 1917 Code of Canon Law replaced it as the primary legal framework for the Catholic Church, and its material remains important to canon lawyers today.[^31]

### The First Jubilee Year (1300)

On February 22, 1300, Boniface promulgated the decree *Antiquorum habet digna fide relatio*, establishing the first Jubilee Year in Christian history.[^32] The decree promised a plenary indulgence—complete remission of temporal punishment for sins—to all pilgrims who traveled to Rome, confessed their sins, and made daily visits to the basilicas of St. Peter and St. Paul.[^33] This innovation proved to be an extraordinary success, transforming Rome into a destination for mass pilgrimage on an unprecedented scale.

Contemporary chronicler Giovanni Villani estimated that approximately 200,000 pilgrims came to Rome during the Jubilee Year, a staggering number for medieval Europe.[^34] Rome's streets became flowing processions of pilgrims from across Christendom. In preparation for this influx, Boniface had ordered the churches of Rome restored and renovated.[^35] The Jubilee Year not only demonstrated the continuing spiritual authority of the papacy but also brought enormous economic benefits to Rome and the Papal States.

The success of the 1300 Jubilee established a tradition that continues to the present day, with subsequent popes declaring Holy Years at various intervals. Modern historians of Renaissance art, including Müntz and Guiraud, have argued that the artistic patronage associated with this Jubilee marked the first significant progress toward the Renaissance.[^36]

### Administrative and Architectural Achievements

Beyond these landmark achievements, Boniface's pontificate included significant administrative reforms and architectural projects. His reordering of the curial fiscal and administrative system improved the efficiency of papal governance.[^37] In 1300, he issued a decisive ruling on the relationship between the diocesan clergy and the clergy of the mendicant orders, resolving a longstanding source of tension within the church.[^38] In 1303, he founded a *studium generale* (university) at Rome, adding to the intellectual infrastructure of the papal capital.[^39]

At Rome, under his patronage, the Palace of the Senator was enlarged, Castel Sant'Angelo was fortified, and the Church of San Lorenzo in Panisperna was built anew.[^40] Boniface was the first pope to permit or commission a significant number of sculptured honorific portraits, commissioning works from the renowned sculptor Arnolfo di Cambio, including statues showing the pope seated on a throne and half-length portraits.[^41] These artistic commissions reflected both his personal vanity and his understanding of the power of visual representation in asserting papal authority.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Conflict with King Philip IV of France

The defining conflict of Boniface VIII's pontificate was his bitter struggle with King Philip IV (Philip the Fair) of France over the respective boundaries of ecclesiastical and temporal power. The conflict began in 1296 when Philip attempted to tax the French clergy without papal consent to fund his wars with England.[^42] Boniface responded by issuing the bull *Clericis laicos* on February 25, 1296, which forbade any imposition of taxes on the clergy without express papal license, under penalty of excommunication.[^43]

This was an assertion of traditional papal prerogatives, but it came at a time of expanding nation-states and increasingly powerful monarchs who sought to consolidate their authority over all persons and institutions within their realms.[^44] Philip retaliated by prohibiting the export of gold, silver, and other valuables from France, effectively cutting off papal revenues from French sources.[^45] After a tense standoff, Boniface was forced to compromise, issuing the bull *Etsi de statu* in July 1297, which conceded that kings could raise taxes on church property during emergencies without papal approval.[^46]

The conflict escalated dramatically in 1301 when Boniface summoned the French bishops to Rome to discuss "the reform of the kingdom," implying criticism of Philip's governance.[^47] Philip responded by convening the first Estates General of France, rallying the nobility and commons to support his antipapal position.[^48] The French sent a letter to the cardinals in Rome declaring their refusal to recognize Boniface as lawful pope.[^49]

On November 18, 1302, Boniface issued the bull *Unam Sanctam*, the most extreme assertion of papal supremacy over secular authority ever made by any pope.[^50] The bull proclaimed that both spiritual and temporal power were under the pope's jurisdiction and that kings were subordinate to the Roman pontiff.[^51] It concluded with the dramatic declaration: "We declare, say, define, and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff."[^52]

Philip's response was devastating. In March 1303, the Estates General met and denounced Boniface as a false pope, simoniac, thief, and heretic.[^53] In June, Philip's supporters arranged for twenty-nine formal charges of heresy to be brought against the pope.[^54] In August, Boniface suspended the rights of all persons in the Kingdom of France to name anyone as regent or doctor, and on April 4, 1303, he excommunicated all persons impeding French clerics from coming to the Holy See.[^55]

### The Outrage at Anagni

The conflict reached its shocking climax on September 7, 1303, when an army led by Philip's minister Guillaume de Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna attacked Boniface at his palace in Anagni, his birthplace where he had retreated for the summer.[^56] The French demanded the pope's abdication. According to tradition, Boniface VIII, then seventy-three years old, responded defiantly: "Here is my neck, here is my head," essentially saying he would "sooner die."[^57] In response, Sciarra Colonna allegedly struck the pope, a blow historically remembered as the *schiaffo di Anagni* (the slap of Anagni).[^58]

The elderly pope was held captive for three days, probably beaten and threatened with execution, though accounts vary.[^59] The townspeople of Anagni eventually rose up and rescued him, driving out the French and Italian forces.[^60] Boniface returned to Rome, but the shock of the assault—both physical and psychological—broke him.[^61] He died on October 11, 1303, just over a month after the attack, in the presence of eight cardinals and chief members of the papal household, after receiving the sacraments.[^62]

### The Feud with the Colonna Family

Another major controversy of Boniface's reign was his vicious feud with the powerful Colonna family. The conflict began when Cardinal Giacomo Colonna disinherited his brothers in 1297, and they appealed to Boniface, who ordered Giacomo to return the land and hand over family strongholds including Palestrina to the papacy.[^63] When Giacomo refused, matters escalated.[^64]

Cardinals Jacopo and Pietro Colonna had also seriously compromised themselves by maintaining questionable relations with papal enemies, including James II of Aragon and Frederick III of Sicily.[^65] In May 1297, Boniface removed them from the College of Cardinals and excommunicated them and their followers.[^66] The Colonna family then declared that Boniface had been elected illegally following Celestine V's unprecedented abdication.[^67]

The dispute led to open warfare. In September 1297, Boniface appointed Landolfo Colonna to command his army against Landolfo's own relatives.[^68] In December, Boniface even proclaimed a crusade against the Colonna family, turning the weapons of holy war against Christian opponents.[^69] By the end of 1298, Landolfo had captured Colonna, Palestrina, and other towns.[^70]

The aftermath was brutal. Despite the towns' peaceful surrender under Boniface's assurances that they would be spared, Palestrina was razed to the ground, the plough was driven through its ruins, and salt was strewn over the site in the ancient manner of utter destruction.[^71] According to Dante's account, the destruction of Palestrina killed 6,000 citizens and destroyed both the home of Julius Caesar and a shrine to Mary.[^72] Only the city's cathedral was spared.[^73] A new city—the Città Papale—later replaced the destroyed town.[^74]

### Nepotism and Family Aggrandizement

Boniface VIII was notoriously guilty of nepotism, openly using his papal office to enrich and elevate his Caetani family.[^75] He founded the Roman house of the Gaetani as a major power, and in the process of exalting his family, he drew upon himself the effective hatred of the Colonna and other powerful clans.[^76] In his first creation of cardinals in 1295, he appointed his nephew Benedetto Caetano.[^77] He later appointed two more relatives as cardinals: Francesco Caetano, son of his brother Peter, and Jacopo (Giacomo) Tomassi Caetani, a Franciscan who was a son of the pope's sister.[^78]

The frank nepotism that Boniface displayed in enriching his Caetani kin with offices and lands in the Papal States created significant opposition among other powerful families and contributed to the political instability of his reign.[^79] His preference for his own family has been cited as an early example of the papacy becoming a "family business," a process that continued under the Renaissance popes and which directly contributed to the corruption that sparked the Protestant Reformation.[^80]

### Dante's Literary Condemnation

Perhaps the most enduring criticism of Boniface VIII came from the pen of Dante Alighieri, the greatest poet of medieval Italy. Dante had personal and bitter reasons for his enmity. In 1300, Boniface invited Count Charles of Valois to intervene in Florentine politics, which allowed the Black Guelphs to overthrow the ruling White Guelphs.[^81] The White Guelph leaders, including Dante, were sentenced to exile.[^82] In March 1302, Boniface's intervention led to Dante being sentenced to death in absentia for his political involvement.[^83]

Dante took his revenge in literature. In the *Inferno*, the first part of his *Divine Comedy*, Dante placed Boniface VIII in the eighth circle of Hell in the third ditch (bolgia) reserved for simoniacs—those guilty of buying or selling church offices and sacred things.[^84] Although Boniface was still alive at the date of the poem's narrative (1300), Dante has one of the damned souls mistake Dante's guide Virgil for Boniface, indicating the pope's imminent arrival in Hell.[^85] Later in the *Inferno*, Dante recalls Boniface's feud with the Colonna family and the destruction of Palestrina.[^86]

Dante also wrote his political treatise *De Monarchia* specifically to refute Boniface's claim in *Unam Sanctam* that the spiritual sword had power over the temporal sword.[^87] In the *Divine Comedy*, Dante pronounces Boniface "the prince of modern Pharisees" and a usurper "who turned the Vatican hill into a common sewer of corruption."[^88] This literary condemnation by one of history's greatest poets has significantly shaped Boniface's negative reputation through the centuries.

## Personal Life

Relatively little is known about Boniface VIII's personal life and inner character beyond his public actions as pope, but contemporary accounts paint a complex portrait. According to the *Catholic Encyclopedia*'s assessment of contemporary sources, Boniface was "the most clever canonist of his time, was a great-hearted and generous man and a lover of magnificence, but also arrogant, proud, and stern in manner, more feared than loved, too worldly-minded for his high office and too fond of money both for the Church and for his family."[^89]

His personality combined brilliant legal intellect with personal vanity and a hot temper. He was a lover of pomp and ceremony, commissioning numerous portraits and sculptures of himself—more than any previous pope—and insisting on being depicted as relatively young and wearing elaborate papal insignia, particularly an ornate crown.[^90] His contemporary, the poet Petrarch, called him "the marvel of the world," though this was a minority opinion among writers of his era.[^91]

Boniface's arrogance and stern manner made him more feared than loved, even among those who supported papal authority.[^92] He lacked the diplomatic finesse and spiritual gravitas that had characterized truly great medieval popes like Gregory VII or Innocent III. The German Catholic historian Gröne observed that while Boniface's utterances equaled in importance those of Gregory VII and Innocent III, the latter were always more ready to act while Boniface preferred to discourse; they relied on the divine strength of their office, while Boniface relied on the cleverness of his canonical deductions.[^93]

Contemporaries noted his love of money, both for enriching the church's coffers and for elevating his family to wealth and power.[^94] This materialism, combined with his worldliness and political scheming, struck many observers as inappropriate for the supreme spiritual leader of Christendom. His combination of legal brilliance and moral failings embodied many of the contradictions of the late medieval papacy, caught between its spiritual mission and its role as a temporal power competing with secular kingdoms.

## Legacy

### Immediate Aftermath and the Avignon Papacy

The immediate legacy of Boniface VIII's pontificate was a dramatic weakening of papal authority and prestige. His death came at a moment when the papacy's centuries-long claim to superiority over secular rulers had been decisively challenged and defeated by the emerging power of national monarchies, particularly France.[^95] Within a few years of his death, the papacy itself fell under French domination when, under pressure, Boniface's successors relocated the papal residence to Avignon in 1309, beginning what contemporaries called the "Babylonian Captivity" of the church—a seventy-year period when the popes resided in France rather than Rome.[^96]

The conflict between Boniface VIII and Philip IV of France thus marked the end of a 225-year phase of papal history characterized by the papacy's struggle to maintain itself as the premier political force in Christendom based on complex legal and doctrinal arguments.[^97] After Boniface, no pope would successfully assert the kind of universal authority over secular rulers that had been claimed by Gregory VII, Innocent III, and Boniface himself.[^98]

### Enduring Contributions to Canon Law and Liturgy

Despite the political disasters of his reign, Boniface made lasting positive contributions to the church. His *Liber Sextus* remained a foundational text in canon law for over six centuries, demonstrating his genuine brilliance as a legal scholar.[^99] The precedent he established with the Jubilee Year of 1300 created a tradition that continues to the present, with Holy Years drawing millions of pilgrims to Rome and providing both spiritual renewal and economic benefits.[^100]

His administrative reforms improved the efficiency of papal governance, and his architectural and artistic patronage contributed to Rome's development as a center of culture and religious authority.[^101] His foundation of a university in Rome (the *studium generale*) added to the city's intellectual infrastructure.[^102] These concrete achievements outlasted the political failures of his reign.

### Historical Assessment and Reputation

Boniface VIII's historical reputation has been predominantly negative, shaped significantly by Dante's powerful literary condemnation and by Protestant writers who included him among the "wicked popes."[^103] The historian Gregorovius called him "an unfortunate reminiscence" of the great popes.[^104] The Protestant tradition and secular historians have often cited his reign as an example of papal corruption, tyranny, and the dangers of theocratic overreach.

However, some historians, particularly Catholic apologists, have attempted to rehabilitate his reputation. They argue that Boniface was not attempting to overpower all secular rulers but rather defending the church's traditional independence and freedom from secular domination during a period when powerful monarchs were asserting unprecedented control over ecclesiastical affairs within their realms.[^105] From this perspective, *Unam Sanctam* was not an innovation but a restatement of traditional medieval ecclesiology at a moment when that tradition was under existential threat.

Modern historians of art credit Boniface with making important contributions to the development of Renaissance artistic culture through his patronage and his commissioning of honorific portraits, which broke new ground in papal self-representation.[^106] His pontificate thus represents both a nadir and a zenith of papal power—the highest theoretical claims of authority combined with practical political defeat.[^107]

### Symbolic Significance

Boniface VIII has become a symbolic figure representing the conflict between spiritual and temporal authority, the dangers of theocracy, and the limits of religious power in an increasingly secular political order. His dramatic confrontation with Philip IV and his humiliation at Anagni have been interpreted as marking the end of the medieval world's hierocratic ideal—the belief that society should be organized under papal spiritual supremacy—and the beginning of the modern system of sovereign nation-states.[^108]

His reign illustrated the fundamental incompatibility between the universal claims of papal monarchy and the particularist reality of emerging national kingdoms. In this sense, Boniface VIII was a tragic figure—a brilliant man who understood and could articulate the logical implications of medieval papal theory, but who lived at precisely the moment when that theory was becoming politically impossible to sustain.[^109]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite the overwhelmingly negative judgments from many historians and contemporaries, Boniface VIII has found defenders who emphasize different aspects of his complex legacy. Catholic historians, particularly those writing in the 19th and early 20th centuries, have argued that Boniface has been treated unfairly by Protestant and secular historians who were predisposed against papal authority.[^110] These defenders emphasize that Boniface was defending legitimate ecclesiastical prerogatives against royal encroachment at a time when monarchs like Philip IV were asserting unprecedented control over the church within their domains.

From this perspective, *Unam Sanctam* was not an arrogant power grab but a defensive statement of traditional Christian ecclesiology that held that spiritual authority was ultimately superior to temporal power—a view that had been normative throughout the medieval period.[^111] Boniface's conflict with Philip IV can be interpreted not as papal aggression but as resistance to French royal attempts to tax, control, and dominate the French church, essentially turning it into a department of state.

His contributions to canon law through the *Liber Sextus* demonstrate genuine scholarly achievement and administrative competence.[^112] This comprehensive legal codification provided clarity and accessibility to church law, facilitating better governance throughout Christendom. Similarly, his establishment of the Jubilee Year showed pastoral concern and religious creativity, providing ordinary Christians with extraordinary opportunities for spiritual renewal and pilgrimage.[^113]

Some modern art historians have praised Boniface's significant role in early Renaissance artistic development, noting that his patronage of Arnolfo di Cambio and other artists, and his commissioning of honorific portraits and architectural projects, represented important innovations in papal self-representation and contributed to the flowering of Italian Renaissance art.[^114] His restoration of Roman churches for the 1300 Jubilee and his various building projects demonstrated a commitment to the physical and cultural infrastructure of the church.[^115]

Additionally, his foundation of the Roman *studium generale* in 1303 contributed to the intellectual life of the church and showed concern for education and scholarship.[^116] His administrative reforms improved the efficiency of papal fiscal and governmental systems, leaving a more functional bureaucracy to his successors.[^117]

### Negative Views

The predominant historical assessment of Boniface VIII has been severely critical, and these negative judgments rest on substantial evidence. The most damning criticism focuses on his arrogance, worldliness, and nepotism. Even sympathetic Catholic sources acknowledge that he was "arrogant, proud, and stern in manner, more feared than loved, too worldly-minded for his high office and too fond of money both for the Church and for his family."[^118]

His blatant nepotism in elevating members of the Caetani family to positions of wealth and power exemplified the corruption that would later provoke the Protestant Reformation.[^119] By founding the Roman house of the Gaetani through papal resources and making multiple relatives cardinals, he set a precedent for treating the papacy as a family business that would be followed by Renaissance popes with disastrous consequences for the church's moral authority.[^120]

The brutal destruction of Palestrina, with its alleged killing of 6,000 citizens, the razing of the city, and the ceremonial spreading of salt over its ruins, represents one of the most morally indefensible acts by any medieval pope.[^121] That this destruction was carried out against fellow Christians over a political dispute with the Colonna family—and that Boniface even proclaimed a crusade against them—demonstrates a shocking misuse of spiritual authority for temporal and personal vendettas.[^122]

His role in Celestine V's abdication, while possibly technically legal, has struck many observers as manipulative and self-serving.[^123] The saintly hermit pope's resignation conveniently cleared the path for the ambitious Caetani cardinal to seize the throne of St. Peter. Whether or not Boniface directly pressured Celestine, his rapid election immediately following the abdication and his subsequent imprisonment of Celestine (ostensibly for the former pope's own protection) cast a shadow over the legitimacy of his papacy.[^124]

The *Unam Sanctam* bull, while perhaps defensible as a statement of traditional theology, was politically tone-deaf and represented exactly the kind of overreaching papal pretension that alienated secular rulers and contributed to the eventual breakdown of medieval Christendom's religious unity.[^125] By declaring that submission to the Roman pontiff was "absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature," Boniface made salvation itself dependent on political submission to papal authority—a claim that many Christians, even devout Catholics, found theologically questionable and politically intolerable.[^126]

Dante's harsh judgment—placing Boniface among the simoniacs in Hell and calling him "the prince of modern Pharisees" who turned "the Vatican hill into a common sewer of corruption"—reflects widespread contemporary perception of the pope as corrupt, worldly, and more interested in power and wealth than spiritual leadership.[^127] The very fact that the greatest Christian poet of the age felt comfortable condemning a reigning pope to eternal damnation indicates how seriously Boniface had failed in his pastoral and spiritual duties.

Finally, his chronic intervention in temporal affairs, his conflicts with rulers across Europe (not just Philip IV of France, but also Albert I of Germany and others), and his general approach of treating the papacy primarily as a political rather than spiritual office contributed to the degradation of papal moral authority that would have severe consequences in subsequent centuries.[^128] As one scholar put it, Boniface relied on "the cleverness of his canonical deductions" rather than on "the Divine strength of his office," suggesting that his legalism and political machinations had replaced authentic spiritual leadership.[^129]
