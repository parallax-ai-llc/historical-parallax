## Summary

Nikolaus Otto was a German engineer who developed the first practical four-stroke internal combustion engine (Otto engine) in 1876. His engine design became the basis for most modern gasoline engines. The four-stroke cycle (intake, compression, power, exhaust) is still called the Otto cycle. His invention was fundamental to the development of automobiles and modern transportation.
