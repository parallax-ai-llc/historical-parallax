## Summary

Fazang was a Chinese Buddhist monk who is considered the third and most important patriarch of the Huayan (Flower Garland) school. He developed the doctrine of the mutual interpenetration of all phenomena — that every element of reality contains and reflects all others. He famously used a hall of mirrors and a golden lion to illustrate his philosophy for Empress Wu Zetian. His system represents one of the most sophisticated philosophical achievements in Buddhist history.
