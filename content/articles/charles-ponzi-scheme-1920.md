## Overview

Charles Ponzi was an Italian swindler who became the namesake for the "Ponzi scheme"—a form of fraud where earlier investors are paid with the money of new investors. In 1920, Ponzi promised Boston investors a 50% return in 45 days (or 100% in 90 days) by exploiting an arbitrage loophole involving international postal reply coupons. The frenzy lasted less than a year but cost investors $20 million ($300 million today) and brought down six banks. Though he didn't invent this type of fraud (Dickens wrote about it), his operation was so brazen and famous that his name attached to it forever.

## Background

### The Man

**Charles Ponzi:**
Arrived in Boston from Italy (1903) with $2.50 in his pocket. "I gambled the rest."
Worked odd jobs. Served time in Canada and Atlanta for forgery/smuggling.

### The Idea (The "Hook")

**Postal Reply Coupons (IRC):**
Coupons sent in letters to allow recipient to buy a stamp for reply.
**Arbitrage:**
Due to post-WWI inflation, an IRC bought in Italy (cheap lira) could be exchanged in USA for stamps worth much more dollars.
**Theory:** Buy cheap in Italy -> Move to US -> Redeem for stamps -> Sell stamps? -> Profit 400%.

**The Flaw:**
Logistically impossible. To handle the volume of money he raised, he would need Titanic-sized ships full of coupons. There weren't enough coupons in the world.

## The Scheme (1920)

### Securities Exchange Company

**The Promise:**
50% interest in 45 days. Banks paid 5% a year.
Ponzi claimed he had a secret network of agents.

**The Mania:**
People lined up around the block. Policemen invested.
Ponzi lived like a prince. Bought mansion, limo.
Grossed $250,000 a day at peak (July 1920).

### Robbing Peter to Pay Paul

Ponzi stopped bothering with coupons. Just paid early investors with satisfied grins using cash from the line outside.

## The Collapse

### The Boston Post

Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation.
Consulted financial expert Clarence Barron (Dow Jones), who calculated:
1. To cover investments, Ponzi needed 160 million coupons.
2. Only 27,000 coupons existed in circulation.

### August 1920

**Run on the Bank:**
Investors demanded money.
Federal agents audited books.
Ponzi found to be insolvent ($7 million debt).

**Arrest:** August 12, 1920.

## Aftermath

**Prison:** 5 years federal, 9 years state.
**Deportation:** Deported to Italy (1934).
**Later Life:** Worked for Mussolini briefly. Moved to Brazil. Died in charity hospital in Rio de Janeiro (1949), blind and penniless.
