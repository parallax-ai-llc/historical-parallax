## Summary

Yehuda Halevi was a medieval Spanish Jewish poet and philosopher who wrote some of the finest poetry in the Hebrew language. His philosophical work The Kuzari defended Judaism through a dialogue between a rabbi and the king of the Khazars. He wrote passionate poems expressing longing for Zion (Jerusalem). He eventually set out on a pilgrimage to the Land of Israel and reportedly died shortly after arriving, possibly in Jerusalem.
