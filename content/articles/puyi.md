## Summary

Puyi (1906-1967), known as the Xuantong Emperor, was the twelfth and last emperor of the Qing dynasty and the final emperor in Chinese history. Crowned at age two in 1908, he was forced to abdicate in 1912, ending over 2,000 years of imperial rule in China.[^1] He later served as the puppet emperor of the Japanese-controlled state of Manchukuo from 1934 to 1945, was imprisoned as a war criminal, and underwent Communist re-education before living his final years as an ordinary citizen working as a gardener in Beijing.[^2] His extraordinary life, spanning from the Forbidden City to a prison cell to a botanical garden, symbolizes China's tumultuous transition from feudal empire to communist state.

## Early Life and Background

Aisin-Gioro Puyi was born on February 7, 1906, in Beijing, China, into the Manchu Aisin-Gioro clan, the ruling house of the Qing dynasty.[^3] His father was Zaifeng, Prince Chun of the Second Rank, and his mother was Youlan of the Gūwalgiya clan.[^4] The clan name Aisin Gioro originates from Manchu linguistic roots: "aisin" translates to "gold," symbolizing imperial prestige, while "gioro" denotes the clan's ancestral lineage tied to the Yilan region in present-day Heilongjiang Province.[^5]

When the Guangxu Emperor died without an heir on November 14, 1908, the dying Empress Dowager Cixi selected two-year-old Puyi, the nephew of the late emperor, to succeed him.[^6] Young Puyi didn't know what was going on when he was crowned emperor at the age of two and cried through much of the coronation ceremony in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on December 2, 1908, carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father.[^7]

The young Puyi had an extraordinarily unusual childhood, separated from his parents and cloistered behind the walls of the Forbidden City, raised by eunuchs and wet nurses.[^8] Eunuchs waited on him when he ate, dressed, and slept; they accompanied him on his walks and to his lessons, serving as his slaves and earliest teachers.[^9] Every day, Puyi had to visit five former imperial concubines, called his "mothers," to report on his progress, and he hated these women, not least because they prevented him from seeing his real mother until he was thirteen.[^10]

The autocratic Empress Dowager Longyu successfully conspired to have Puyi's beloved wet nurse Wang expelled from the Forbidden City when he was eight, on the grounds that Puyi was too old to be breast-fed.[^11] Puyi had a standard Confucian education, being taught the various Chinese classics and nothing else during his early years.[^12] His isolated upbringing in the Forbidden City created a distorted view of the world that would affect him throughout his life, as he was surrounded by sycophants and lived in an artificial environment completely disconnected from the reality of early twentieth-century China.

---

## Rise to Power

Puyi's "rise to power" was entirely circumstantial rather than earned. He reigned under a regency for three years as the Xuantong Emperor from 1908 to 1912.[^13] However, his reign coincided with the collapse of the Qing dynasty amid the Chinese Revolution of 1911. On February 12, 1912, Empress Dowager Longyu signed the Imperial Edict of Abdication on Puyi's behalf in response to the revolutionary upheaval, ending the 267-year Qing rule of China and the 2,000-year-old imperial system.[^14]

In return for his abdication, the royal family was offered the Articles of Favorable Treatment, which allowed Puyi to retain his imperial title and continue to live in the Forbidden City with substantial financial support from the new republican government.[^15] For the next twelve years, Puyi lived in the Forbidden City maintaining the trappings of imperial life while China transformed around him.

In 1917, the warlord Zhang Xun orchestrated a brief restoration attempt. On the morning of July 1, 1917, Zhang Xun took advantage of political unrest and entered Beijing, proclaiming the restoration of Puyi as Emperor of China at 4 AM, renaming the year from the "sixth year of the Republic of China" to the "ninth year of Emperor Xuantong's reign."[^16] Zhang Xun, who commanded the so-called "braided army" of troops who retained their queues as a sign of loyalty to the Qing, hung the dynasty's dragon banners around Beijing.[^17] However, the restoration lasted less than two weeks—from July 1 to July 12, 1917—and was quickly reversed by Republican troops who seized control of the railway lines to the capital.[^18] On July 12, 1917, the defeated Zhang Xun took refuge in the Dutch legation while Puyi abdicated for the second time.[^19]

In 1924, warlord Feng Yuxiang expelled Puyi from the Forbidden City.[^20] Puyi moved to the Japanese concession of Tianjin in February 1925, first into Zhang Garden, and in 1929 into the Garden of Serenity (Jingyuan).[^21] Tianjin was, after Shanghai, the most cosmopolitan Chinese city, with large British, French, German, Russian, and Japanese communities, and as an emperor, Puyi was allowed to join several social clubs that normally only admitted whites.[^22]

On November 10, 1931, Puyi left the Garden of Tranquility hidden in the trunk of his car and went to Dagu where he boarded the Japanese warship Awaji Maru, destined for a new stage of his life under Japanese control in Manchuria.[^23]

## Major Achievements

Puyi was characterized as "the puppet emperor" who was not in power even for a day, which severely limited his ability to implement meaningful reforms or genuine accomplishments.[^24] Unlike other historical rulers, Puyi's significance lies not in his achievements but in what he symbolized—the end of an ancient tradition.

During his time in the Forbidden City after his abdication, Puyi attempted some limited reforms. He appointed Zheng Xiaoxu as minister of the Household Department, and Zheng hired Tong Jixu, a former Air Force officer from the Beiyang Army, as chief of staff to help with reforms.[^25] After his wedding in 1922, he dismissed some eunuchs in an attempt to stop the widespread theft and sale of treasures from the Forbidden City.[^26] Following a suspicious fire, he evicted the eunuchs from the palace with the support of the Beiyang Army.[^27]

One notable cultural change Puyi initiated was cutting off his queue (the traditional Manchu hairstyle) because of the influence of his British tutor Reginald Johnston, who spoke disparagingly of Chinese queues and said they looked like pigtails. Puyi recommended other nobles do the same, and this nomadic Manchu hairstyle finally disappeared from Chinese history.[^28]

Puyi's most substantial achievement came after his imprisonment. During his decade-long incarceration and re-education, he wrote his autobiography "From Emperor to Citizen" (我的前半生, literally "The First Half of My Life"), which provides a unique first-person account of life in the Forbidden City and his extraordinary transformation.[^29] The Bernardo Bertolucci film "The Last Emperor" is based on this book.[^30] Due to the social and political atmosphere at the time of publication, around 160,000 words were deleted from the manuscript, though a full version was later restored in 2007.[^31]

After his release from prison in 1959, he became a member of the fourth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and worked as an editor for the CPPCC.[^32] He also worked as a gardener at the Beijing Botanical Gardens from 1960, a position that reportedly suited him well.[^33] When he wasn't working, he would visit the Forbidden City and act as an impromptu tourist guide, pointing out various items he used to use as a boy.[^34]

His successful transformation from emperor to ordinary citizen under Communist rule became a propaganda showcase for the effectiveness of the Chinese Communist Party's re-education programs, demonstrating that even the most privileged members of the old feudal system could be reformed into productive socialist citizens.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most significant controversy surrounding Puyi concerns his role as the puppet emperor of Manchukuo, the Japanese-controlled state in Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia from 1932 to 1945. On March 9, 1932, he was installed as president, and from 1934 to 1945 he served as emperor under the reign title of Kangde.[^35]

Manchukuo was a puppet state created by Imperial Japan following the Mukden Incident and invasion of Manchuria. Puyi was brought in by the Japanese to serve as its nominal regent, though he had no actual political power.[^36] Real authority rested in the hands of Japanese military officials.[^37] Under the illusion of independence, all Manchurian officials and Puyi were under constant surveillance, with every Chinese official having a Japanese advisor who would instruct them regarding choices and decisions.[^38]

The international community questioned Manchukuo's legitimacy from the start. An investigation report published in October 1932 by the League of Nations stated that Manchukuo was directed and organized by the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff Office and not a movement of national self-determination.[^39] The Lytton Commission found that the new state was not the product of an indigenous or spontaneous independent movement seeking to be free of China, but was rather dependent on Japanese military support.[^40] In the form of an international treaty, this agreement effectively set Manchukuo up as a Japanese colony and drew outrage from many countries, leading Japan to withdraw from the League of Nations in 1933.[^41]

Chinese historians generally refer to the state as "Wei Manzhouguo" ("false Manchukuo") to emphasize its alleged lack of legitimacy.[^42] Historians generally consider Manchukuo a puppet state or colony of Imperial Japan because of the Japanese military's strong presence and strict control of the government administration, in addition to Japan's wartime atrocities against the local population.[^43]

Puyi testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in Tokyo in 1946 and proved to be an exceptionally difficult witness.[^44] He testified in court for eight days, and his appearance was described as obdurate and unproductive.[^45] When asked about dates regarding Manchukuo's establishment, he responded "Please don't ask me any more about the question of dates," and was constantly interrupted, disingenuous about his own notes, fearful, and shifty.[^46] He testified that he resented the Japanese influence in his nation, but later, in his autobiography published in the 1960s, he retracted his statements made at the tribunal.[^47]

While in Chinese Communist custody, Puyi's narrative changed significantly. He wrote: "Of course, I absolutely cannot put all the blame for all the crimes in the first half of my life on the Japanese fascist invaders," and expressed loathing for his "14 years of collaboration with the Japanese bandits in their crimes against the people of northeast China."[^48]

Some scholars argue that although aware the feudal system was decaying and behind the times, Puyi continued to pursue his own dreams, unwilling to waken to the truth and applying his efforts to rewind history, which was ultimately a waste of energy and "plain laughable."[^49] He also implicated his British tutor Reginald Johnston at the war crimes trials of 1946, and portrayed him as a villain in his autobiography, claiming Johnston had lured him away from all that was best in Chinese culture and toward Western Imperialism.[^50]

---

## Personal Life

Puyi had five wives in total throughout his life. He married his first two wives in a double wedding ceremony in 1922: Empress Wanrong and Consort Wenxiu.[^51] Wanrong (1906-1946), of the Manchu Plain White Banner Gobulo clan, became his primary empress consort.[^52] The couple's relationship was initially good, and Puyi showed preference for Wanrong over Wenxiu and displayed trust in her.[^53] However, after Wenxiu divorced Puyi and left in 1931, Puyi blamed Wanrong, stopped speaking to her, and ignored her presence.[^54] She became addicted to opium and eventually died in a prison in Yanji, Jilin, after being arrested by Chinese Communist soldiers in 1946.[^55]

His third wife was Tan Yuling (married 1937), and his fourth was Li Yuqin (married 1943).[^56] In 1962, under an arrangement with Premier Zhou Enlai, Puyi married his fifth and last wife, Li Shuxian (1925-1997), a nurse.[^57] This time Puyi enjoyed a happy marriage. According to sources, this relationship represented true companionship, as Puyi and Li Shuxian helped and comforted each other in their difficulties through deep conjugal love.[^58]

Puyi had one younger full brother, Pujie (1907-1994), who served as his heir presumptive and married Hiro Saga, a relative of Japanese Emperor Hirohito, plus two younger full sisters.[^59] He also had a younger half-brother, Aisin Gioro Puren (later Jin Youzhi; 1918-2015), born to a concubine, who adopted a commoner name after 1949 and worked as a primary school teacher in Beijing until retirement.[^60] Another half-brother, Puqi, was born in 1916 but died in infancy in 1918.[^61] His half-sisters numbered five: Yunxian (born 1914; died 2003), Yunxin (born 1917; later Jin Ruijie), Yunyu (born 1919), Yunhuan (born 1921; died 2004), and one additional sister whose details are less documented.[^62]

Puyi produced no biological heirs across his five marriages, leaving the succession of the House of Aisin-Gioro dependent on adoption or agnatic claims within the imperial clan.[^63] Clan head Jin Yuzhang (born 1942), son of Puyi's youngest brother Puren, has led efforts to preserve Manchu heritage through cultural and scholarly activities.[^64]

His most influential relationship outside his family was with Reginald Johnston, his British tutor. Johnston was appointed tutor to thirteen-year-old Puyi in 1919, selected by the Colonial Office for his expertise in Chinese history and culture.[^65] More than a tutor, Johnston befriended the isolated adolescent and became both a teacher and a friend who bore witness to the tangled complexity of emotions Puyi experienced amid great historical changes.[^66]

Johnston had a profound influence on Puyi. In Puyi's eyes, everything Johnston did was the best. Johnston made Puyi feel that foreigners were the wisest and most civilized people and that Johnston was the most learned man of all Westerners.[^67] Johnston obtained a bicycle, telephone, and against the wishes of the retainers, much-needed spectacles for Puyi.[^68] He taught Puyi about the latest knowledge and ideas from the West, encouraging the young emperor to study abroad, and gave Puyi the English name "Henry."[^69] Johnston documented his experiences in his book "Twilight in the Forbidden City" (1934), which was used as a source for Bernardo Bertolucci's film "The Last Emperor," in which Johnston was portrayed by Peter O'Toole.[^70]

Puyi's personality was complex and shaped by his extraordinary circumstances. Re-educated in Chinese prisons, he learned how to dress himself, work on an assembly line, and criticize his former uselessness and pride.[^71] He reportedly said: "You should not be serving me. I should be serving you," reflecting his transformation from an emperor accustomed to being served to an ordinary citizen.[^72] He also noted in his autobiography: "I never tired of buying pianos, watches, clocks, radios, Western clothes, leather shoes and spectacles," revealing his fascination with Western material goods.[^73]

## Legacy

Puyi's legacy as the last emperor of China is complex and multifaceted. He remains an enduring symbol of the end of an era and the birth of modern China.[^74] His abdication serves as a symbol of the end of a long era in China, which is why Xuantong is widely known as the Last Emperor.[^75]

Historians continue to study and interpret his life and legacy, with some viewing him as a tragic figure and victim of circumstances beyond his control who was manipulated by foreign powers and domestic factions.[^76] His story illuminates the complexities and contradictions of a nation in transition through his experiences as a child emperor, puppet ruler, prisoner of war, and ordinary citizen.[^77]

Puyi's extraordinary life has been extensively documented through photographs. Among the portraits of Qing emperors that have survived, those of Puyi are the largest in number and the most diverse in terms of contents, with the majority preserved in the form of photographs.[^78] Puyi left a complete archive of photographs documenting moments throughout his life from his ascendancy to the throne at age three to his abdication at age six, and was the only emperor in Chinese history who kept a journal of his life with photographs.[^79]

The 1987 film "The Last Emperor," directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and starring John Lone as Puyi, won nine Academy Awards, unexpectedly sweeping every category in which it was nominated, including Best Picture.[^80] The film was the first Western feature film authorized by the People's Republic of China to film in the Forbidden City in Beijing.[^81] It has an approval rating of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics noting that "stupendous visuals and John Lone's ability to make passivity riveting give The Last Emperor a rarified grandeur."[^82]

Puyi died of kidney cancer and heart disease on October 17, 1967, in Beijing during the Cultural Revolution.[^83] His ashes were first placed at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery alongside those of other party and state dignitaries.[^84] In 1995, his widow Li Shuxian relocated his ashes to Hualong Royal Cemetery near the Western Qing Tombs, a privately-owned cemetery located approximately five kilometers from where an imperial tomb had been planned for him in 1915.[^85] The site is near where four of the nine Qing emperors preceding him are interred, along with three empresses and sixty-nine princes, princesses, and imperial concubines.[^86]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some scholars view Puyi sympathetically as a tragic figure caught in forces beyond his control. From this perspective, he was a victim of circumstance who was thrust onto the throne as a toddler, forced to navigate the collapse of an ancient dynasty, manipulated by Japanese imperialists, and ultimately had to reinvent himself completely under Communist rule.[^87]

His successful transformation from emperor to ordinary citizen is seen by some as a genuine achievement demonstrating human adaptability and the capacity for personal change. After his release from prison in 1959, he worked productively as a gardener and editor, integrating into socialist society.[^88] The Chinese Communist Party presented his re-education as evidence that even the most privileged members of the old feudal system could be reformed into productive citizens.

His autobiography "From Emperor to Citizen" provides valuable historical testimony about life in the Forbidden City and the tumultuous period of Chinese history he witnessed. Scholars appreciate this first-person account despite recognizing it was written under Communist supervision and pressure.[^89]

Defenders note that Puyi had virtually no agency during most of his life. He was crowned at age two, had no power during his childhood reign, lived as a powerless figure in the Forbidden City after abdication, and served as a mere figurehead under Japanese control in Manchukuo. From this view, holding him personally responsible for the crimes committed by the Manchukuo regime is unjust given his complete lack of real authority.[^90]

Some historians emphasize that Puyi's isolation and unusual upbringing distorted his development and understanding of the world. Raised by eunuchs in the artificial environment of the Forbidden City, separated from his parents, and surrounded by sycophants, he had limited opportunity to develop normal judgment or independence.[^91]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Puyi bears responsibility for his collaboration with Japanese imperialism regardless of his limited power. He willingly served as the face of Manchukuo, providing legitimacy to a brutal puppet regime that committed atrocities against the Chinese people.[^92] His fourteen years of collaboration with Japanese forces cannot be excused simply because he lacked ultimate decision-making authority.

Some scholars criticize Puyi's persistent attempts to restore imperial rule even when the feudal system was clearly obsolete. They argue that although aware the feudal system was decaying and behind the times, Puyi continued to pursue his own dreams, unwilling to acknowledge reality and applying his efforts to reverse history, which was ultimately wasteful and "plain laughable."[^93]

His testimony at the Tokyo Tribunal was problematic and evasive. He was described as an exceptionally difficult witness who was obdurate, unproductive, fearful, and shifty, refusing to answer basic questions about dates and circumstances.[^94] Critics note that he later retracted statements from the tribunal and changed his narrative to suit his Communist captors, raising questions about the sincerity of both accounts.[^95]

His later autobiography and confessions are viewed by some scholars with skepticism, recognizing they were written under duress during his re-education and imprisonment. He himself acknowledged: "I now feel very ashamed of my testimony, as I withheld some of what I knew to protect myself from being punished by my country."[^96]

Some historians are critical of how Puyi blamed others for his choices, including his British tutor Reginald Johnston. He portrayed Johnston as a villain who lured him away from Chinese culture toward Western imperialism, when in reality Johnston had tried to modernize and educate him.[^97]

The scholarly debate ultimately centers on whether Puyi should be understood primarily as a victim or as someone who bears responsibility for his actions. A key question from 1929 to 1934 was whether he was an independent executive, as Japan argued, or a puppet, as China held, with most historians concluding he was indeed a puppet.[^98]
