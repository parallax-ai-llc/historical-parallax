## Summary

On March 10, 1959, tens of thousands of Tibetans surrounded the Dalai Lama's palace in Lhasa to protect their spiritual and political leader from what they believed was a Chinese plot to kidnap or kill him. What followed was the bloodiest chapter in Tibet's modern history: a week of resistance, a harrowing escape across the Himalayas, and a merciless crackdown that killed thousands and signaled the end of Tibet as Tibetans had known it.[^1]

The uprising was the culmination of nine years of Chinese occupation. When Mao's armies invaded in 1950, they promised autonomy under the "Seventeen-Point Agreement." Instead, they brought collectivization, restrictions on religion, and the dismantling of Tibet's Buddhist society. By 1959, resistance had already erupted in eastern Tibet, and Lhasa was tense. When crowds gathered to protect the Dalai Lama, Chinese artillery answered.[^2]

On March 17, the 23-year-old Dalai Lama fled, disguised as a soldier, beginning a two-week journey across the world's highest mountains. He reached India on March 31, never to return. Behind him, the Chinese crushed all resistance, shelled monasteries, and began a transformation that would destroy Tibet's religious culture. Sixty-five years later, the Dalai Lama remains in exile, Tibet remains under Chinese control, and March 10 is commemorated worldwide as Tibetan Uprising Day.[^3]

- Armed resistance already underway

### Why Did It Fail?

**Military asymmetry:**
- Tibetan forces no match for PLA
- No outside military support
- Geographic isolation

**Geopolitical:**
- India didn't intervene militarily
- Cold War dynamics; West focused elsewhere
- UN expressed concern but no action

### Significance

**For Tibet:**
- End of independent existence
- Beginning of cultural destruction
- Diaspora preserves culture abroad

**For the world:**
- Symbol of occupation and resistance
- International Tibet solidarity movement
- Human rights concern continues[^14]
