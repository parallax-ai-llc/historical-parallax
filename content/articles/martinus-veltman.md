## Summary

Martinus Veltman was a Dutch theoretical physicist who shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics with Gerard 't Hooft for their work on the quantum structure of electroweak interactions. He developed computational methods that allowed 't Hooft to prove renormalizability of the Standard Model. His computer program Schoonschip for symbolic computation was an early contribution to computer algebra systems.
