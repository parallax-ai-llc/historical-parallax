## Summary

Marie Van Brittan Brown invented the first home security system in 1966, featuring a camera, monitor, remote-controlled door lock, and alarm button. Her patent laid the groundwork for all modern home security systems and video intercom systems. She developed it because police were slow to respond to calls in her Queens, New York neighborhood.
