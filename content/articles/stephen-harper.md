## Summary

Stephen Joseph Harper served as the 22nd Prime Minister of Canada from 2006 to 2015, leading the Conservative Party of Canada through three consecutive federal elections. An economist by training, Harper transformed Canadian politics by uniting the Canadian Alliance and Progressive Conservative parties, ending over a decade of Liberal governance. His tenure was marked by fiscal conservatism, a strong pro-Israel foreign policy, tough-on-crime legislation, and controversial approaches to environmental policy and parliamentary democracy. Harper's legacy remains deeply contested, with supporters praising his economic stewardship during the 2008 financial crisis and critics condemning his centralization of power and weakening of democratic institutions.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Stephen Joseph Harper was born on April 30, 1959, in Leaside, Toronto, Ontario, to Margaret (née Johnston) and Joseph Harris Harper, an accountant at Imperial Oil.[^3] He was the eldest of three sons in a middle-class family that later moved to the suburban Toronto neighborhood of Etobicoke. Harper attended Northlea Public School and later John G. Althouse Middle School before enrolling at Richview Collegiate Institute, where he was a member of the Reach for the Top team that won the 1978 Ontario championship.[^4]

Harper's early political consciousness was shaped by his father's moderate conservative views and the political climate of 1970s Canada under Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government. After graduating from high school in 1978, Harper briefly attended the University of Toronto, where he studied economics. However, dissatisfied with the academic environment and seeking new opportunities, he dropped out after two months and moved to Edmonton, Alberta, in 1978.[^5]

In Edmonton, Harper worked in the mail room at Imperial Oil, his father's employer, which gave him firsthand experience of Western Canadian alienation from Central Canadian political dominance. This experience would profoundly shape his political ideology and future policy positions.[^6] He enrolled at the University of Calgary in 1985, earning a bachelor's degree in economics in 1985, followed by a master's degree in economics in 1991. His thesis examined the relationship between government spending and economic growth, revealing his emerging free-market economic philosophy.[^7]

During his university years, Harper became increasingly involved in conservative politics, particularly the burgeoning Reform Party movement led by Preston Manning. The Reform Party's platform of Western Canadian interests, fiscal conservatism, and populist democratic reform resonated deeply with Harper's evolving political worldview.[^8]

---

## Rise to Power

Harper's entry into professional politics began in 1985 when he became an aide to Progressive Conservative MP Jim Hawkes, though he grew disillusioned with the Progressive Conservative Party's moderate positions and what he perceived as their abandonment of conservative principles.[^9] In 1987, Harper left the Progressive Conservatives and became one of the founding members of the Reform Party of Canada, serving as the party's chief policy officer from 1987 to 1991.[^10]

His first electoral victory came in 1993 when he defeated his former boss, Jim Hawkes, to win the Calgary West riding for the Reform Party. As a Reform MP, Harper quickly established himself as an articulate and ideologically committed advocate for Western Canadian interests, democratic reform, and fiscal conservatism.[^11] However, frustrated with the direction of the party under Preston Manning's leadership and the constraints of parliamentary life, Harper resigned from Parliament in 1997 to become vice-president and later president of the National Citizens Coalition, a conservative advocacy organization.[^12]

Harper's return to electoral politics came in 2002 when he successfully ran for leadership of the Canadian Alliance, the successor party to Reform. Recognizing that neither the Canadian Alliance nor the Progressive Conservative Party could defeat the Liberals while the conservative vote remained split, Harper orchestrated a historic merger between the two parties in 2003, creating the Conservative Party of Canada.[^13] In March 2004, Harper won the leadership of the newly unified Conservative Party on the first ballot with 56% of the vote.[^14]

In the 2004 federal election, Harper led the Conservatives to Official Opposition status, winning 99 seats but failing to defeat Paul Martin's Liberals. However, the subsequent sponsorship scandal that engulfed the Liberal government provided Harper with the opportunity he needed.[^15] In the 2006 election, Harper's Conservatives won a minority government with 124 seats, ending 12 years of Liberal rule. On February 6, 2006, Stephen Harper was sworn in as Canada's 22nd Prime Minister at age 46.[^16]

## Major Achievements

Harper's most significant economic achievement was his government's management of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. Despite initially denying that Canada would enter recession, Harper implemented a stimulus package worth approximately $47 billion, which helped Canada weather the crisis better than most G7 nations.[^17] Canada maintained relatively strong banking regulations that prevented the kind of banking collapse seen in the United States, and Harper's government received international praise for its economic stewardship during this period.[^18]

Under Harper's leadership, Canada negotiated and signed numerous free trade agreements, including the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European Union, trade agreements with South Korea, Honduras, Jordan, Panama, and Colombia, and concluded negotiations for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.[^19] These agreements represented a significant expansion of Canada's trade relationships and reflected Harper's commitment to free market economics.

Harper introduced the Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) in 2009, which became one of his most popular domestic policy initiatives. The TFSA allowed Canadians to contribute up to $5,000 annually (later increased to $10,000 in 2015) into tax-sheltered savings accounts, providing significant tax benefits to middle-class Canadians.[^20] His government also reduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) from 7% to 5% in two increments, fulfilling a key campaign promise.[^21]

In foreign policy, Harper significantly reoriented Canada's international positioning. He became one of Israel's strongest supporters on the world stage, describing Canada's support for Israel as "principled" and unwavering.[^22] His government took robust positions against Russian aggression, with Harper personally confronting Vladimir Putin at international summits over Russia's annexation of Crimea.[^23] Canada under Harper also took strong positions against Iran's nuclear program and human rights record.

Harper's government delivered a formal apology to Indigenous Canadians in 2008 for the residential school system, acknowledging that the policy of forced assimilation was wrong and had caused profound harm to Indigenous communities, families, and cultures.[^24] This apology, accompanied by the establishment of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, was widely regarded as a historic moment in Canadian-Indigenous relations, though critics noted that Harper's subsequent policies often contradicted the spirit of reconciliation.[^25]

On crime and justice, Harper implemented a tough-on-crime agenda that included mandatory minimum sentences for various offenses, tougher youth justice laws, and elimination of the "faint hope clause" that allowed early parole consideration for murderers.[^26] His government also passed the Victims Bill of Rights in 2015, giving crime victims greater standing in the criminal justice system.[^27]

Harper appointed three Supreme Court justices during his tenure and reformed the Senate appointment process by creating an advisory committee, though he ultimately made controversial appointments that circumvented his own reforms.[^28] His government also passed the Federal Accountability Act in 2006, which strengthened lobbying rules, protected whistleblowers, and created the position of Parliamentary Budget Officer.[^29]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Harper's tenure was marked by significant controversies, particularly regarding democratic governance and parliamentary procedure. His government was found in contempt of Parliament in 2011, the first time in Canadian history and among Westminster parliamentary systems globally, for refusing to provide cost estimates for crime legislation, corporate tax cuts, and F-35 fighter jet purchases.[^30] This historic rebuke highlighted concerns about Harper's approach to parliamentary accountability and transparency.

The prorogation of Parliament in 2008 and again in 2009 generated intense criticism from constitutional experts, opposition parties, and civil society organizations. In December 2008, facing a potential non-confidence vote and proposed Liberal-NDP coalition government supported by the Bloc Québécois, Harper requested and received prorogation from Governor General Michaëlle Jean, effectively shutting down Parliament for seven weeks.[^31] Critics argued this was an abuse of executive power designed solely to avoid democratic accountability.[^32]

Harper's environmental record was widely criticized by environmental organizations, scientists, and international observers. His government withdrew Canada from the Kyoto Protocol in 2011, making Canada the first and only signatory to formally withdraw from the climate agreement.[^33] The government was accused of "muzzling" federal scientists, implementing policies that restricted their ability to speak publicly about their research, particularly regarding climate change and environmental issues.[^34] These restrictions were documented in numerous reports and drew international condemnation from scientific organizations.[^35]

The government's relationship with Indigenous peoples deteriorated significantly despite the 2008 apology. Harper's statement in 2009 that Canada had "no history of colonialism" drew widespread condemnation and revealed what critics characterized as a fundamental misunderstanding or denial of Canadian history.[^36] His government was also criticized for inadequate responses to missing and murdered Indigenous women, with Harper infamously characterizing the crisis as "not high on our radar" and refusing to call a national inquiry.[^37]

The Fair Elections Act, passed in 2014, generated intense controversy and was condemned by the Chief Electoral Officer, constitutional experts, and democracy advocates. The legislation eliminated vouching (a process that allowed voters without proper ID to vote), restricted the Chief Electoral Officer's ability to encourage voting, and made other changes critics argued would suppress voter turnout, particularly among marginalized communities.[^38]

Harper's government faced multiple scandals involving senators he had appointed. The Senate expense scandal involving Mike Duffy, Pamela Wallin, Patrick Brazeau, and Mac Harb dominated headlines for months and implicated Harper's chief of staff, Nigel Wright, who provided Duffy with $90,000 to repay contested expenses.[^39] The scandal contradicted Harper's promises of accountability and raised serious questions about his judgment and the conduct of his office.[^40]

The government's approach to refugees and immigration generated significant criticism, particularly the controversial designation of "safe countries" that restricted refugee claims from certain nations, and cuts to refugee health care that were later ruled unconstitutional.[^41] The Syrian refugee crisis response was widely criticized as inadequate until the 2015 election campaign forced policy changes.[^42]

Critics also condemned Harper's centralization of power in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO), arguing that he had undermined cabinet government, backbench MPs, and democratic deliberation. Journalists and scholars documented extensive message control, limited media access, and a governing style characterized as autocratic and controlling.[^43][^44]

## Personal Life

Stephen Harper married Laureen Teskey on December 11, 1993. Laureen, originally from Turner Valley, Alberta, worked as a graphic designer before becoming involved in political life. The couple has two children: Benjamin, born in 1996, and Rachel, born in 1999.[^45] Throughout Harper's political career, Laureen maintained a relatively private profile while engaging in charitable work, particularly animal welfare advocacy, and served as patron of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies.[^46]

Harper is known for his reserved, private personality, contrasting sharply with more gregarious political contemporaries. He has been described by colleagues and journalists as intensely intellectual, disciplined, and policy-focused, but also as controlling, partisan, and unwilling to compromise.[^47] Unlike many politicians, Harper showed little interest in the social aspects of political life, preferring policy briefings and strategic planning to social gatherings and public events.[^48]

A passionate hockey fan, Harper co-authored a book about the history of hockey titled "A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey," published in 2013.[^49] He has also performed as a musician at various events, playing piano and singing, including a notable performance of "With a Little Help from My Friends" at the National Arts Centre in 2009 that revealed a more human side to his public persona.[^50]

Harper's religious faith, as an evangelical Christian and member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, influenced his worldview though he generally kept his faith private and resisted attempts to characterize him as pursuing a "hidden agenda" based on religious conservatism.[^51] He attended East Gate Alliance Church in Ottawa during his time as Prime Minister.[^52]

After leaving office in 2015, Harper moved his family back to Calgary. He established a consulting firm, Harper & Associates, and joined the board of the Conservative Friends of Israel.[^53] He remained active in conservative politics internationally, establishing the International Democrat Union Forum and speaking at conservative events globally.[^54] His post-political activities included writing and consulting work, maintaining a lower public profile in Canadian politics while remaining influential in international conservative circles.[^55]

## Legacy

Stephen Harper's legacy remains intensely debated in Canadian political discourse. His supporters argue that he fundamentally transformed Canadian conservatism, creating a durable political coalition that united Western populists, fiscal conservatives, and social conservatives into an effective electoral force.[^56] The Conservative Party he created remains Canada's primary center-right political vehicle, suggesting institutional durability beyond his personal tenure.[^57]

Economically, Harper's defenders point to Canada's performance during the 2008-2009 financial crisis as evidence of sound stewardship. His expansion of free trade agreements, tax reductions, and generally pro-business policies are credited with strengthening Canada's economic position.[^58] The TFSA remains popular across the political spectrum, representing a lasting policy innovation.[^59]

However, Harper's critics argue that his legacy is one of damaged democratic institutions, weakened environmental protections, and increased partisan polarization. The muzzling of scientists, withdrawal from Kyoto, and failure to address climate change are cited as profound failures that set Canada back in addressing existential environmental challenges.[^60] Democratic watchdogs and constitutional experts argue that Harper's approach to parliamentary government, including prorogations, omnibus bills, and contempt of Parliament, weakened Canadian democracy and set dangerous precedents.[^61]

Harper's impact on Canadian foreign policy represents a significant reorientation that subsequent Liberal governments partially reversed. His strong support for Israel, skepticism toward the United Nations, and emphasis on military engagement represented a departure from Canada's traditional peacekeeping and multilateral approach.[^62] Whether this shift represented mature realism or ideological rigidity remains contested.[^63]

The 2015 electoral defeat, in which Justin Trudeau's Liberals won a majority government, suggested public weariness with Harper's approach after nearly a decade in power. The "Harper fatigue" phenomenon and Liberal campaign promises to "restore" democracy, science, and Canada's international reputation implicitly repudiated much of Harper's legacy.[^64]

Institutionally, Harper's centralization of power in the PMO became a model that subsequent prime ministers have largely maintained, suggesting that some of his changes to governing practice have become normalized rather than reversed.[^65] This represents perhaps his most significant and concerning legacy for democratic governance in Canada.[^66]

Harper's approach to Indigenous issues remains particularly contentious. While the 2008 residential schools apology was historic, his subsequent policies, statements, and refusal to hold an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women are seen as contradicting reconciliation principles.[^67] The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's 94 Calls to Action, released near the end of Harper's tenure, implicitly critiqued his government's record while setting an agenda his successors embraced.[^68]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and journalistic assessments from conservative and centrist perspectives credit Harper with significant accomplishments and political acumen. Political scientist Tom Flanagan, Harper's former advisor, described him as "the most important Conservative politician since John A. Macdonald" for his role in uniting Canada's conservative movement and building an electoral coalition capable of governing.[^69]

Economic analysts have praised Harper's crisis management, noting that Canada's banking system stability and stimulus response positioned the country favorably compared to other developed nations during the Great Recession. His government's incremental approach to deficit reduction balanced growth concerns with fiscal responsibility in ways many economists endorsed.[^70]

Conservative intellectuals argue that Harper brought ideological coherence and policy seriousness to Canadian conservatism, elevating it from regional protest movement to national governing philosophy. His emphasis on federalism, free markets, individual responsibility, and traditional institutions represented a genuine conservative vision adapted to Canadian circumstances.[^71]

Supporters of Harper's foreign policy argue that his principled stands on Israel, Ukraine, and human rights represented moral clarity in international affairs and strengthened Canada's standing among democratic allies. His government's commitment to maternal and child health in developing countries through the Muskoka Initiative demonstrated leadership on global development issues.[^72]

Business leaders and free-market advocates consistently praised Harper's pro-business policies, corporate tax reductions, and regulatory approaches. Organizations representing small business, resource industries, and financial services viewed Harper as an ally who understood economic growth drivers and implemented supportive policies.[^73]

Some Indigenous leaders acknowledged that the 2008 apology, despite subsequent policy failures, represented an important symbolic step that created political space for reconciliation discourse. The willingness to acknowledge historical wrongs, even if implementation fell short, had lasting significance for Indigenous-settler relations.[^74]

### Negative Views

Critical scholarly assessments characterize Harper's tenure as damaging to Canadian democracy and institutions. Constitutional expert Errol Mendes argued that Harper's approach to parliamentary government, including prorogations, omnibus bills, and information control, represented "an assault on Canadian democracy."[^75] Political scientist Donald Savoie documented how Harper's centralization of power exceeded even previous prime ministers known for tight control.[^76]

Environmental scholars and activists view Harper's legacy as catastrophic for climate action and environmental protection. Climate scientist Andrew Weaver (who later became a Green Party provincial politician) described Harper's policies as "the most anti-environmental government in Canadian history."[^77] The withdrawal from Kyoto, muzzling of scientists, and weakening of environmental assessments are cited as evidence of ideological hostility to environmental protection.[^78]

Journalists who covered Harper extensively, including Lawrence Martin and Michael Harris, produced scathing assessments of his governing style, characterizing it as secretive, controlling, and contemptuous of democratic norms. Their books documented extensive message control, limited accountability, and what they viewed as abuse of power.[^79][^80]

Indigenous scholars and activists argue that Harper's tenure represented a lost opportunity for meaningful reconciliation. Despite the 2008 apology, his government's actions—including the "no history of colonialism" statement, failure to address missing and murdered Indigenous women, and opposition to the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples—revealed fundamental disrespect for Indigenous rights and realities.[^81]

Civil liberties organizations documented concerns about Bill C-51 (anti-terrorism legislation), the Fair Elections Act, and other measures they characterized as threatening fundamental rights and democratic participation. The Canadian Civil Liberties Association and other watchdogs consistently criticized Harper-era legislation as prioritizing security and partisan advantage over rights protection.[^82]

International observers noted Canada's declining reputation during Harper's tenure on issues ranging from climate change to human rights. Canada's failure to win a UN Security Council seat in 2010 was widely interpreted as reflecting international disapproval of Harper's policies and diplomatic approach.[^83]

Progressive economists criticized Harper's emphasis on corporate tax cuts, arguing that the benefits accrued disproportionately to wealthy Canadians and corporations while doing little to stimulate broad-based economic growth or address inequality.[^84] His government's attacks on unions and collective bargaining were seen as ideologically driven rather than economically necessary.[^85]
