## Summary

U Wisara (1889-1929) was a Burmese Buddhist monk who became one of the most important martyrs of Myanmar's independence movement. Born Hla Kyaw in a small village in Sagaing Division, he entered monkhood in 1912 and later became a prominent anti-colonial activist alongside U Ottama. Imprisoned repeatedly by British authorities for "inciting sedition," U Wisara died on September 19, 1929, after a 166-day hunger strike protesting the forced removal of his religious robes in Yangon Prison. His ultimate sacrifice galvanized the nascent independence movement and established him as a symbol of resistance against colonial oppression. Today, he is commemorated with U Wisara Road in Yangon and a monument near the Shwedagon Pagoda.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

U Wisara was born Hla Kyaw on April 24, 1889, to Daw Zalat and U Pya in Kanneint, a small village in Sagaing Division in Upper Burma.[^1][^4] Like most Burmese boys of his era, he received his early education at the local Buddhist monastery, Inna Monastery, run by Venerable U Sandima.[^1] At age 12, he became a novice monk with the dhamma title of Wisara (Vicāra), meaning "investigation" or "contemplation" in Pali.[^1][^4] However, after four years as a novice, he left the monkhood and returned to lay life.

At age 18, Hla Kyaw was married off to a local girl, Me Nyan, with whom he had a daughter named Phwa Yan.[^1] The arranged marriage broke down three months after their daughter was born, a painful experience that shaped his early adult life.[^1] He subsequently remarried his childhood sweetheart, Thay Hmyin, who gave birth to a second daughter named Nwe.[^1] Despite his family responsibilities, the young man felt increasingly drawn to religious life and contemplated returning to the monkhood.

At age 23 in 1912, after much reflection, Hla Kyaw decided to leave his family and enter the monkhood permanently.[^1] He sought and received permission from his parents and wife to pursue this calling. He was ordained as a monk at the Bonpyan Monastery by Chief Abbot U Ādeissa (Ādicca), once again taking the religious name Wisara.[^1][^4] In the monastery, he immersed himself in studying the dhamma (the Buddha's teachings) and the vinaya (the rules for monks), demonstrating exceptional dedication to his spiritual education.[^1]

## Religious Education and Scholarly Pursuits

Following his ordination, U Wisara embarked on an extensive program of religious and linguistic education that would span over a decade. The young monk studied grammar, Pali language, and the Theravada Canon under the tutelage of different learned sayadaws (senior monks) throughout Upper Burma, traveling to Magyibok, Pyinmana, Chaung-U, Mandalay, and Pakokku to learn from various teachers.[^1][^4] This peripatetic education was common among serious Buddhist scholars, who sought out the most knowledgeable masters in different specialties.

His scholarly ambitions eventually led him beyond Burma's borders. U Wisara traveled to India where he studied Sanskrit and the Nāgarī script for two years.[^1][^5] This period of study in India proved significant, as it exposed him not only to classical Buddhist texts in their original Sanskrit but also to the political ferment of the Indian independence movement, which was gaining momentum under leaders like Mahatma Gandhi. The Nāgarī script he studied was the ancestor of Devanagari and other variants, traditionally used to write Prakrit and Sanskrit texts.[^6]

Upon returning to Burma, U Wisara settled in Pakkoku, a town in central Myanmar along the Irrawaddy River. There, he became increasingly involved in the local monastic community and gained respect for his learning and dedication. In the early 1920s, as Burma's independence movement began to take shape, he became an executive committee member in the local association of monks in Pakkoku.[^1][^7] This position would soon draw him into the political struggles that would define the remainder of his life.

## Rise to Prominence in the Independence Movement

The 1920s marked a crucial turning point in Burma's colonial history, as resistance to British rule intensified and organized. In 1920, the General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) was formed from the merger of the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) with various patriotic organizations, seeking to widen support for the movement beyond the relatively Westernized leadership of previous groups.[^8] The GCBA cooperated closely with the General Council of Sangha Sammeggi (GCSS), which brought together radical monks who would become known as "political pongyis" (sammeggi means "united" or "unity").[^7][^8]

U Wisara's entry into active political resistance came through a fateful meeting in 1923 with U Ottama, an Arakanese Buddhist monk who is considered by many to be the father of Burma's independence movement.[^1][^9] U Ottama had been close to the Indian National Congress and Mahatma Gandhi, and had already been imprisoned once for making anti-colonial speeches, becoming the first monk in British Burma to be imprisoned specifically for speaking out against colonial authorities.[^8][^9] U Ottama's activities helped propagate a combination of nationalism, Buddhism, and, in its later stages, socialism throughout Burma.[^8]

Inspired by U Ottama's example and methods of "non-cooperation" brought back from India, U Wisara began traveling the country alongside him, giving fiery speeches against British rule.[^1][^9][^10] The two monks became the most prominent religious leaders in the independence movement during the 1920s. Monks such as Ottama and Wisara took on the responsibility of awakening the lay people's patriotic spirit, becoming heroes of the anti-colonial fight.[^11] They were among the first and most famous "political monks" whose methods of resistance combined Buddhist principles with nationalist agitation.[^11]

Colonial authorities viewed these politically active monks with suspicion and hostility. Scholar Michael Mendelson wrote in his work "Sangha and State in Burma" that all politically active monks tended to be labeled by the British colonial authorities as "political agitators in the yellow robes."[^12] This characterization reflected the British difficulty in understanding or accepting the traditional role of Buddhist monks as moral authorities and protectors of the people, a role that naturally extended to resistance against perceived injustice and oppression.

---

## First Imprisonment and Hunger Strike (1926-1929)

In 1926, U Wisara's anti-colonial activism led to his first major confrontation with British authorities. He was sentenced to prison for one year and nine months for making an "illegal speech" in the Tharrawaddy District.[^1][^13] This imprisonment would test his resolve and establish the pattern of resistance that would ultimately cost him his life.

Upon arrival at the prison, authorities ordered U Wisara to remove his Buddhist monk's robes and wear the standard inmate uniform.[^1][^13] For U Wisara and other Buddhist monks, the robe was not merely clothing but a sacred symbol of their ordination and commitment to the dhamma. To forcibly remove it was to attack their very identity as monks and violate one of the most fundamental aspects of Buddhist monastic life. When U Wisara refused to comply, British officers—finding that Indian prison guards would not disrobe him—forcibly removed his robes themselves.[^1][^13][^14]

In response, U Wisara immediately began a hunger strike, refusing to take any food or drink until he was allowed to wear his robes.[^1][^13] He repeated his conditions: that he would take milk if he was allowed to wear the robe, and food if he was allowed to fast on Sabbath days (traditional Buddhist observance days), and that he was prepared to die for the cause.[^15] Prison officials repeatedly tortured him, but he did not give in.[^13][^14] His determination and willingness to suffer highlighted the profound injustice of the colonial prison system's inability or unwillingness to accommodate religious observance.

Forty days into the hunger strike, with U Wisara's health deteriorating and public attention increasingly focused on the case, prison officials finally relented and allowed him to wear his robes.[^1][^13] However, rather than keep him in Burma where his case had become well-known, authorities transferred him to a prison in Midnapore, West Bengal, India, hoping to reduce the political impact of his imprisonment.[^1][^16] This transfer demonstrated the British awareness of U Wisara's growing symbolic importance to the independence movement.

U Wisara was eventually released from prison on February 29, 1929.[^1][^13] However, his freedom would prove tragically short-lived.

---

## Final Arrest and the 166-Day Hunger Strike

Upon his release, U Wisara promptly rejoined the political scene, demonstrating that imprisonment had not diminished his commitment to Burma's independence. Within weeks, he was arrested again for making an anti-colonialist speech at a village near Thongwa in present-day Yangon Region.[^1][^13] This time, he was sentenced to six years in prison for inciting sedition, a much harsher sentence that reflected British frustration with his continued activism.[^1][^13]

In a replay of his first imprisonment, authorities at Yangon Prison forcibly disrobed U Wisara and ordered him to wear prison clothing.[^1][^13][^14] Once again, he refused to accept this violation of his religious identity. On April 6, 1929, U Wisara began what would become his final hunger strike.[^1][^13][^15] He made the same demands as before: he would take milk if allowed to wear his robes, and food if allowed to fast on Buddhist Sabbath days. He made clear that he was prepared to die rather than submit to the colonial authorities' disrespect for his faith.[^15]

The 1929 hunger strike became a test of wills between the colonial government and the independence movement. Prison officials did not relent even as the news of the strike attracted increasing attention throughout Burma and beyond.[^15] As the weeks turned into months, U Wisara's health deteriorated steadily. Over four months into the strike, on August 17, 1929, a few senior monks were finally allowed to see him in prison.[^1][^17] What they witnessed horrified them—U Wisara was emaciated and weak, yet his resolve remained unshaken.

The British authorities faced a dilemma. To allow U Wisara to wear his robes would be to acknowledge defeat and potentially encourage other imprisoned monks to make similar demands. Yet to let him die would create a martyr and risk inflaming anti-colonial sentiment throughout the country. In the end, they chose to hold firm, perhaps calculating that U Wisara would eventually break, or perhaps simply unwilling to show what they perceived as weakness.

On September 19, 1929, at 8:20 in the morning, after 166 days without food, U Wisara died in Yangon Prison of starvation.[^1][^2][^13][^17] He was 40 years old. His body was unceremoniously dropped off by police at a monastery in Kyimyindaing, west of downtown Yangon, at 3 a.m.[^1][^18]

---

## Immediate Aftermath and Funeral

News of U Wisara's death spread rapidly throughout Burma and sent ripples of shock and anger across the country.[^1][^2][^18] For many Burmese who had not previously concerned themselves with politics, U Wisara's ultimate sacrifice profoundly moved them and drew them into the independence movement.[^1][^2][^18] The colonial authorities had created exactly what they had feared: a martyr whose death would inspire resistance for generations.

Almost immediately, U Wisara became known as an azani (martyr) in Burmese nationalist discourse.[^18] When his body was cremated and buried in the public square west of the Shwedagon Pagoda (today's People's Square and Park), thousands attended the funeral.[^1][^2][^18] The massive public turnout demonstrated both the widespread grief at his death and the growing strength of the independence movement. The funeral became a moment of collective resistance, as mourners openly defied colonial authority by honoring a man the British had imprisoned and allowed to die.

The death of U Wisara also had practical consequences for prison policy. His sacrifice and the public outcry that followed led to changes in how Buddhist monks were treated in colonial prisons. Monks were subsequently allowed to wear their religious robes and to fast while in prison, a recognition—albeit too late for U Wisara—that the previous policy had been both cruel and counterproductive.[^18]

## Major Achievements and Contributions

U Wisara's achievements must be measured not in conventional political or military terms, but in the realm of moral leadership and symbolic resistance. His most significant contribution to Burma's independence movement was demonstrating the power of principled nonviolent resistance and the willingness to sacrifice one's life for deeply held beliefs.

By making his stand on the issue of religious freedom and the right to wear monastic robes, U Wisara highlighted the fundamental incompatibility between Buddhist values and colonial oppression. His resistance was not merely political but deeply spiritual, rooted in the understanding that to surrender his robes would be to surrender his identity as a monk and his commitment to the dhamma. This fusion of religious and political resistance made his struggle comprehensible and meaningful to the vast majority of Buddhist Burmese.

U Wisara's speeches and travels with U Ottama helped spread nationalist sentiment throughout Burma, particularly in rural areas that might otherwise have remained isolated from the independence movement. As members of the sangha (monastic community), monks like U Wisara and U Ottama commanded respect and attention that secular political leaders might not have achieved. They used their moral authority to awaken patriotic consciousness and encourage resistance to colonial rule.[^9][^10][^11]

His hunger strikes, particularly the final 166-day fast, demonstrated extraordinary physical and mental endurance in service of principle. The hunger strike as a form of political resistance had particular resonance in the Buddhist context, where fasting was already an established spiritual practice. U Wisara transformed this religious practice into a powerful tool of political resistance, creating a model that would influence future generations of activists in Burma and beyond.

Perhaps most importantly, U Wisara's death created a lasting symbol of resistance that transcended his individual life. His martyrdom demonstrated that the independence movement was not merely about political or economic grievances, but about fundamental human dignity and the right to practice one's religion free from interference. This moral dimension strengthened the independence movement by giving it a clear ethical foundation.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The legacy of U Wisara, like that of many political figures, is not without controversy. British colonial authorities consistently portrayed him and other politically active monks as dangerous agitators who violated the proper separation between religion and politics. Colonial administrators argued that monks should confine themselves to spiritual matters and stay out of political affairs.[^12] They viewed the "political pongyis" as manipulating their religious authority to incite sedition and unrest among the population.

From the British perspective, U Wisara's imprisonment was justified because he had broken colonial laws against seditious speech and incitement. They argued that prison regulations requiring uniform clothing applied equally to all inmates and that making exceptions for religious dress would undermine prison discipline. Some colonial officials suggested that U Wisara's hunger strikes were theatrical gestures designed to create martyrs and inflame anti-British sentiment, rather than genuine expressions of religious conviction.

Critics might also question whether U Wisara's sacrifice was strategically wise or necessary. His death, while inspiring, left the independence movement without one of its most effective leaders. Some might argue that he could have served the cause better by accepting temporary compromises, surviving imprisonment, and continuing to lead resistance efforts after his release. The decision to fast unto death might be seen as inflexible or even as a form of suicide prohibited by Buddhist teachings, though supporters would argue that he died defending the dhamma rather than intentionally ending his life.

The involvement of monks in politics remains controversial in Myanmar to this day. While many Burmese revere U Wisara and U Ottama as heroes, others worry that political activism by monks compromises the sangha's spiritual authority and independence. Some contemporary Buddhist scholars argue that monks should focus on teaching and practicing the dhamma rather than engaging in worldly political struggles. This debate reflects ongoing tensions in Theravada Buddhist societies about the proper role of the monkhood.

Additionally, the nationalist movement that U Wisara helped inspire has sometimes been associated with ethnic Bamar nationalism that marginalized Burma's many ethnic minorities. While U Wisara himself does not appear to have promoted ethnic chauvinism, the broader movement's emphasis on Buddhist identity and Burmese culture sometimes excluded or alienated non-Buddhist and non-Bamar communities. This raises complex questions about the relationship between religious nationalism and inclusive democratic politics.

## Personal Life and Character

Despite his prominent role in Burma's independence movement, relatively little is known about U Wisara's personal life and character beyond the basic biographical facts. The available sources provide glimpses of a man whose personal relationships were shaped by his religious calling and political commitment.

His early life reveals a man torn between worldly and spiritual vocations. His first marriage to Me Nyan, arranged when he was 18, ended in failure after just three months.[^1] This suggests either a fundamental incompatibility or perhaps his unwillingness or inability to fulfill the role of householder while being drawn to monastic life. His second marriage to Thay Hmyin, described as his childhood sweetheart, appears to have been more emotionally fulfilling, resulting in a second daughter, Nwe.[^1] However, even this relationship ultimately could not compete with his calling to the monkhood.

The fact that U Wisara sought and received permission from his parents and wife before entering the monkhood permanently suggests a man who valued family relationships and felt obligated to honor them even as he pursued a different path.[^1] This respect for family obligations while ultimately choosing a higher calling reflects traditional Burmese Buddhist values that see monastic ordination as bringing merit to one's family rather than abandoning them.

As a monk, U Wisara demonstrated exceptional dedication to learning, traveling widely to study under different teachers and even journeying to India for advanced linguistic training.[^1][^4] This intellectual curiosity and commitment to scholarship suggests a thoughtful, studious personality rather than a mere agitator. His mastery of Pali, Sanskrit, and Nāgarī script indicates considerable linguistic talent and scholarly rigor.

U Wisara's character is perhaps most clearly revealed through his actions during his imprisonments. His absolute refusal to compromise on the issue of wearing his robes, even unto death, demonstrates extraordinary strength of conviction and willingness to suffer for principle. The fact that he made clear from the beginning that he was prepared to die rather than submit shows a man of clear moral vision and unflinching courage.[^15] His conditions—that he would take milk if allowed to wear robes, food if allowed to fast on Sabbath days—reveal someone who understood negotiation and gradual compromise, yet who also had absolute red lines he would not cross.

The senior monks who visited him in prison after more than four months of fasting witnessed his physical deterioration but also his unshaken resolve.[^17] This suggests a man whose spiritual strength sustained him even as his body failed. His willingness to endure such prolonged suffering for a principle reflects the depth of his Buddhist conviction that attachment to the body must be transcended in service of the dhamma.

## Legacy and Lasting Impact

U Wisara's legacy has endured for nearly a century since his death, making him one of the most enduring symbols of Burmese resistance to oppression. His influence can be measured in multiple dimensions: commemorative, inspirational, and practical.

The most visible aspect of his legacy is found in the physical commemorations that bear his name. In 1940, Voyle Road in Yangon—named after a British lieutenant who died in the Second Anglo-Burmese War in 1852—was renamed U Wisara Road in his honor.[^19] This major avenue in Myanmar's largest city serves as a daily reminder of his sacrifice. In 1943, during the Japanese occupation, a monument to U Wisara was erected at a crossroads near the western gate of the Shwedagon Pagoda, close to where his remains were interred.[^18][^19] The monument's location is symbolically significant, placing U Wisara's memory in proximity to Burma's most sacred Buddhist site.

U Wisara's inspirational legacy has been even more profound. Both U Wisara and U Ottama became enduring inspirations to activists and students involved in the independence movement and subsequent pro-democracy struggles.[^12] The Saffron Revolution of 2007, in which Buddhist monks led mass protests against Myanmar's military dictatorship, consciously drew on the tradition of activist monks established by U Wisara and U Ottama decades earlier.[^20] The image of monks leading resistance to oppressive government has become iconic in Myanmar's political culture, with U Wisara serving as the archetypal example.

His death also had practical impacts on how religious prisoners were treated. Following the public outcry over his death, colonial authorities changed prison regulations to allow monks to wear their robes and observe religious fasts while incarcerated.[^18] While this came too late for U Wisara himself, it represented a concrete victory won through his sacrifice and prevented future monks from facing the same impossible choice.

U Wisara's method of resistance—principled nonviolent protest culminating in self-sacrifice—provided a model for future generations of activists not only in Burma but potentially in other contexts where religious leaders opposed political oppression. His hunger strike parallels similar actions by other independence movement figures, such as the Irish republicans who fasted in British prisons and Indian independence activists who used hunger strikes as political weapons. In each case, the willingness to die for principle rather than submit to injustice created powerful moral and political pressure on authorities.

More broadly, U Wisara helped establish the legitimacy of politically engaged Buddhism in Myanmar. While this legacy has been controversial, with some arguing that monks should remain apolitical, the tradition of monks as moral authorities who speak out against injustice has deep roots in Theravada Buddhist societies. U Wisara's example demonstrated that monastic vows and political resistance could be compatible when the political struggle was fundamentally about defending Buddhist values and the welfare of the people.

His legacy also contributed to the narrative of Burmese national identity. The independence movement needed heroes and martyrs, and U Wisara provided a powerful example of sacrifice for the nation. His story combined religious devotion, nationalist commitment, and moral courage in a way that resonated deeply with Buddhist Burmese values. The fact that he was not a secular politician but a monk made his sacrifice particularly meaningful in a society where the sangha held special moral authority.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians sympathetic to Burma's independence movement have consistently praised U Wisara as a hero and martyr who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country's freedom. His willingness to die rather than compromise on his religious principles is seen as exemplifying the highest Buddhist virtues of right action and non-attachment to the physical body. Human Rights Watch's comprehensive 2009 report "The Resistance of the Monks: Buddhism and Activism in Burma" places U Wisara in a long tradition of Buddhist activism in Burma, portraying him as one of the pioneers who established the legitimacy of political engagement by monks.[^8][^14]

The Irrawaddy, one of Myanmar's most respected independent news organizations, has consistently honored U Wisara's memory, featuring him in their "On This Day" historical series and "Places in History" commemorations.[^2][^13] Their coverage emphasizes how his death "fed the flames of the growing Burmese nationalist movement" and galvanized resistance to colonial rule.[^2] This interpretation sees U Wisara's sacrifice as strategically effective, not merely symbolic—his martyrdom strengthened and expanded the independence movement in concrete ways.

Burmese nationalist historians have emphasized U Wisara's role as the second most important nationalist monk of the 1920s after U Ottama.[^8] They credit him with helping to spread anti-colonial consciousness throughout rural Burma and with demonstrating that effective resistance to British rule was possible. His education and linguistic abilities are often highlighted to counter colonial stereotypes of "political pongyis" as mere agitators, showing instead that the leading nationalist monks were sophisticated intellectuals who understood both Buddhist philosophy and political strategy.

The Lost Footsteps historical project, which documents Myanmar's complex history, presents U Wisara as part of the broader story of Burma's struggle for independence and dignity.[^4][^18] Their coverage emphasizes the cultural and religious dimensions of his resistance, helping contemporary audiences understand why the issue of wearing robes was worth dying for in a Buddhist context. This interpretive framework presents U Wisara not as a fanatic but as someone defending fundamental religious freedoms that colonial authorities failed to respect.

Contemporary democracy activists in Myanmar have claimed U Wisara's legacy, seeing in his resistance to authoritarian power a model for their own struggles against military dictatorship. The monks who led the 2007 Saffron Revolution explicitly drew on the tradition of U Wisara and U Ottama, demonstrating the continuing relevance of his example nearly eight decades after his death.[^20] This continuity suggests that U Wisara's legacy transcends the specific context of anti-colonial struggle and speaks to broader themes of justice, dignity, and resistance to oppression.

### Negative Views and Critical Perspectives

British colonial authorities and their apologists presented a very different view of U Wisara, portraying him as a dangerous agitator who manipulated his religious status to incite sedition and unrest. Colonial administrator records and correspondence characterized politically active monks as "political agitators in the yellow robes" who violated proper boundaries between religion and politics.[^12] From this perspective, U Wisara's speeches were not legitimate political expression but criminal incitement designed to undermine lawful authority and public order.

Colonial officials argued that prison regulations were applied uniformly to all inmates regardless of religious status, and that making exceptions would create dangerous precedents and undermine prison discipline. They suggested that U Wisara's hunger strikes were theatrical performances designed to create martyrs and inflame nationalist sentiment rather than genuine expressions of religious conviction. Some colonial documents implied that if U Wisara died, it was by his own choice rather than through any cruelty by prison authorities, who merely required him to follow the same rules as other prisoners.

Some Buddhist scholars and monastics, both historically and in contemporary times, have questioned whether monks should engage in worldly political struggles at all. Traditional Theravada Buddhist teaching emphasizes the importance of monks focusing on spiritual practice and teaching the dhamma rather than involving themselves in political affairs. From this perspective, monks like U Wisara, however well-intentioned, risked compromising the sangha's spiritual authority and independence by becoming entangled in political conflicts. The proper role of monks, according to this view, is to provide spiritual guidance while remaining above partisan political struggles.

Critical historians have noted that while U Wisara himself may have been motivated by principles of justice and religious freedom, the broader nationalist movement he helped inspire sometimes took exclusionary forms. The emphasis on Buddhist identity and Burmese culture in the independence movement sometimes marginalized Burma's many ethnic minorities and religious groups. While there is no evidence that U Wisara himself promoted ethnic chauvinism, the Buddhist nationalist tradition he helped establish has been invoked by later movements that were less inclusive, including contemporary Buddhist nationalist groups that have targeted Muslim minorities.

Some might also question the strategic wisdom of U Wisara's decision to fast unto death. While his martyrdom was inspirational, it deprived the independence movement of an effective leader who might have contributed more through continued activism. A more pragmatic approach—accepting temporary compromises to survive imprisonment and resume resistance afterward—might have been more strategically effective. This critique suggests that rigid adherence to principle, while morally admirable, may not always serve the practical interests of a political movement.

Finally, revisionist historians have complicated the simple narrative of colonial oppression and indigenous resistance by noting that many Burmese collaborated with British rule and that the independence movement was deeply divided by factional conflicts. The General Council of Burmese Associations (GCBA) experienced serial splits during the 1920s that weakened the movement.[^8] While U Wisara and U Ottama were important figures, the actual achievement of independence required decades of additional struggle and was ultimately shaped more by global forces (particularly World War II and British imperial decline) than by the activism of the 1920s.
