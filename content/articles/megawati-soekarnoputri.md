## Summary

Diah Permata Megawati Setiawati Sukarnoputri served as Indonesia's fifth president from 2001 to 2004, becoming the nation's first and only female president to date.[^1] The eldest daughter of founding president Sukarno, she rose from political obscurity as a housewife to lead the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) through Indonesia's turbulent democratic transition.[^2] Her presidency stabilized Indonesian democracy following the chaotic Wahid administration, though she faced criticism for indecisiveness and her controversial response to separatist conflicts.[^3] Megawati remains a powerful political figure as PDI-P chairwoman, shaping Indonesian politics for over three decades.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Megawati Soekarnoputri was born on January 23, 1947, in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to President Sukarno and his wife Fatmawati.[^5] She was Sukarno's second child and eldest daughter, with her surname "Sukarnoputri" literally meaning "daughter of Sukarno."[^6] Her mother Fatmawati, who descended from Minang aristocracy in Inderapura, was one of Sukarno's nine wives and famously sewed the Indonesian flag hoisted during the nation's independence proclamation on August 17, 1945.[^7]

Growing up in her father's Merdeka Palace, young Megawati danced for her father's guests and developed a passion for gardening.[^8] President Sukarno frequently invited her to meet world leaders including Richard Nixon, Indira Gandhi, Josip Broz Tito, and Nikita Khrushchev, exposing her to international politics from a young age.[^9] However, her privileged childhood ended abruptly when she was 19 years old. In 1966, her father relinquished power and was succeeded by General Suharto's New Order government.[^10]

Megawati's education was disrupted by her father's fall from power. She initially attended Universitas Padjadjaran in Bandung to study agriculture but dropped out in 1967 to be with her father following his political downfall.[^11] When Sukarno died in 1970, Megawati enrolled at Universitas Indonesia to study psychology but dropped out after two years, never completing her university education.[^12]

Her personal life during this period was marked by tragedy. In 1968, she married First Lieutenant Surindro Supjarso, an Air Force pilot whose acquaintance was arranged through Guntur, Sukarno's eldest son.[^13] After marriage, she moved to Madiun, East Java, where she gave birth to her first child, Mohammad Rizki Pratama, and embraced the role of housewife.[^14] While pregnant with her second child, Mohammad Prananda Prabowo, tragedy struck when Surindro died in a plane crash in 1970 when his Skyvan T-701 aircraft crashed in Biak waters, Papua.[^15] At the end of March 1973, Megawati married Taufiq Kiemas, a figure close to Sukarno's ideological legacy, in a union that received the blessing of Sukarno's family.[^16] This marriage would prove pivotal to her political future, as Kiemas encouraged her to enter politics.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Until the late 1980s, Megawati Sukarnoputri saw herself primarily as a housewife, with no apparent political ambitions.[^18] Her entry into politics came in 1984 when she was recruited by PDI chairman Soerjadi, though she did not run for office until 1987.[^19] That year, encouraged by her husband Taufiq Kiemas, who would later become Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly, Megawati joined the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) and successfully ran for a seat in the People's Representative Council (DPR).[^20]

Her political ascent accelerated dramatically in December 1993 when she declared herself de facto chair of PDI, a position ratified in 1994.[^21] This appointment occurred despite active government interference, as was typical when New Order opposition parties held their congresses under Suharto's authoritarian regime.[^22] Megawati stubbornly defied government attempts to prevent her from taking over the party leadership, leveraging her status as Sukarno's daughter to build popular support.[^23]

The Suharto government viewed Megawati's growing popularity with alarm. In June 1996, the government engineered her removal as head of PDI, backing a co-opted faction led by Suryadi to replace her.[^24] This maneuver was designed to disqualify her from running for president in the 1998 elections.[^25] On July 27, 1996, an attack by soldiers and hired thugs led by Lieutenant-General Sutiyoso on demonstrating Megawati supporters in Jakarta resulted in fatal riots and looting, an event that would fuel opposition to Suharto's regime.[^26]

After Suharto's resignation in 1998 and the lifting of restrictions on political parties, Megawati and her supporters founded the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) in opposition to the pro-Suharto PDI faction.[^27] The new party campaigned on maintaining the ideals of Reformasi, including institutionalizing democracy with popular sovereignty, eradicating corruption, collusion and nepotism, strengthening press and civil society, and upholding the supremacy of law.[^28]

In the June 1999 legislative elections, PDI-P won 34 percent of the vote, the best showing of any party.[^29] However, in the October 20, 1999 presidential election by the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Megawati lost to Abdurrahman Wahid, receiving 313 votes compared to Wahid's 373, despite her party's electoral victory.[^30] PKB nominated Megawati for vice president, and she defeated Hamzah Haz 396 to 284 to become vice president alongside President Wahid.[^31]

As Wahid's presidency descended into chaos amid corruption allegations and erratic governance, Megawati began to distance herself from the president as a Special Session of the MPR approached in 2001.[^32] On July 23, 2001, after Wahid issued a decree to dissolve the Indonesian legislature and suspend the Golkar Party, the MPR removed Wahid from office and swore in Megawati as Indonesia's first female president.[^33]

## Major Achievements

### Constitutional and Democratic Reforms

Megawati's administration passed two significant constitutional amendments—the third amendment on November 10, 2001, and the fourth amendment on August 1-11, 2002—which contributed to the formation of the Constitutional Court and the dissolution of the Supreme Advisory Council.[^34] Most importantly, she established Indonesia's first system for direct presidential elections, allowing Indonesian citizens to directly choose their president and vice president rather than through parliamentary selection.[^35] This democratic reform fundamentally transformed Indonesian politics, though it would ultimately lead to her own electoral defeat in 2004.

### Anti-Corruption Institutions

Megawati played a key role in forming the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), an independent institution designed to fight corruption in Indonesia.[^36] Her administration successfully arrested 17 corrupt generals, demonstrating some commitment to combating military corruption.[^37] However, this achievement was undermined by her decision to halt prosecutions of private bankers alleged to have stolen billions from state-supported banks when the dictatorship fell, leading to accusations of selective justice.[^38]

### Economic Recovery and Debt Renegotiation

Since her inauguration, Megawati's administration strove to provide conditions conducive to rebuilding the economy that had been in ruins since the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[^39] She attended Paris Club and London Club meetings to renegotiate Indonesia's outstanding debts, resulting in a delay of $5.8 billion in debt payments at an April 2002 Paris Club meeting.[^40] Her administration successfully left the IMF program in 2003 and assisted the economy to improve export performance, with annual growth rates exceeding 7 percent by the end of her term.[^41]

Her economic policy was characterized by widespread privatization of state-owned enterprises (SOEs), done to defend SOEs from public intervention and debt payments while increasing efficiency.[^42] She chose technocrats for top economic positions and generally favored policy professionals over party politicians.[^43] However, critics noted that her economic team was composed of smart people with different philosophies who never developed a coherent policy framework.[^44]

### Counter-Terrorism Response

Shortly after her inauguration, Megawati visited the United States on September 19, 2001, meeting with President George W. Bush to pledge cooperation against radical Islamic terrorism.[^45] This commitment was tested when the 2002 Bali bombings killed 202 people on October 12, 2002.[^46] Megawati immediately traveled to Bali on the same day, directly inspected the bombing location, and expressed condolences.[^47]

The day after, she held an impromptu plenary cabinet session on October 13, 2002, to hold National Police Chief General Dai Bachtiar accountable.[^48] The Anti-Terrorism Law (ATL) was signed into law by President Megawati on October 18, 2002, just six days after the Bali bombings, though the law had been drafted in April 2002 following the September 11 attacks.[^49] On October 26, 2002, at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, Megawati emphasized that Indonesia was the main victim of terrorism and appealed to heads of state to cancel travel bans imposed after the Bali bombings.[^50]

### Political Stabilization

According to a former adviser, "Megawati stabilized the country and oversaw its path to democracy."[^51] She stabilized the overall democratization process and the relationship between legislative, executive, and military institutions during a critical transition period.[^52] While unable to make "lasting progress in the fight against corruption," she achieved "some successes—notably in improving political stability" during Indonesia's fragile democratic consolidation.[^53]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Aceh Crisis and Human Rights Violations

In 2003, President Megawati declared martial law in Aceh to end the decades-long rebellion by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), directly contradicting her 1999 pledge not to let blood be shed in the natural-resource-rich province.[^54] In 1999, she had tearfully promised Acehnese people that she would "not let even a drop of blood spill in Tanah Rencong [Aceh]."[^55]

General Sutarto imposed martial law in Aceh for six months, and the Indonesian government deployed 30,000 military personnel and 12,000 police to the province.[^56] During this period, government forces conducted numerous human rights abuses including torture, rape, forced disappearances, and murder of civilians.[^57] Megawati turned a deaf ear to international outcry protesting the systematic crimes against humanity by the military against civilians.[^58]

The government of President Megawati Sukarnoputri failed dismally to make progress on prosecuting grave human rights violations in Aceh for which government security forces were believed responsible.[^59] There was no serious judicial accountability for abuses such as the widely alleged torture and killing of civilians in Aceh, a failure that remains one of the darkest stains on her presidency.[^60]

### Indecisiveness and Lack of Leadership

Megawati's presidency was marked with indecisiveness, lack of clear ideological direction, and "a reputation for inaction on important policy issues."[^61] She appeared to see her role mainly as a symbol of national unity and rarely actively intervened in government business.[^62] The process of democratic reform begun under Habibie and Wahid continued under Megawati, albeit slowly and erratically.[^63]

Outside observers questioned her ability to become a world leader due to her lack of political experience, with her quiet nature sometimes interpreted as serenity but by others as signs of being unprepared.[^64] Some Indonesian scholars explained Megawati's apparent passivity in office by reference to Javanese mythology, suggesting she saw her father, Sukarno, as a "Good King" of Javanese legend, while Suharto was the "Bad Prince" who had usurped the Good King's throne, implying she viewed her role as symbolic restoration rather than active governance.[^65]

### Corruption and Governance Failures

Despite creating the KPK, corruption continued to be pervasive during Megawati's presidency, though she herself was seldom blamed for personal corruption.[^66] Megawati's government acknowledged it had done little to stop corruption, with the state development planning minister estimating that 20 percent of Indonesia's foreign aid loans were siphoned off the top each year.[^67]

Her government was beset by charges of corruption and was criticized for its inability to lower the country's high unemployment rate.[^68] The Megawati government faced many problems including obstacles to assistance from the central government to the Bali local government, the handling of legislation that did not yet exist, and limited institutional capacity for crisis response.[^69]

### Electoral Defeat and Refusal to Concede

In Indonesia's first direct presidential election in 2004, Megawati was decisively defeated by her former Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security Affairs, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY).[^70] In the first round on July 5, 2004, Yudhoyono received 33.58% of votes compared to Megawati's 26.24%.[^71] In the second round on September 20, 2004, Yudhoyono defeated Megawati with 60.62% of valid ballots.[^72]

Megawati neither conceded defeat, nor congratulated her successor, nor attended his inauguration, displaying what critics characterized as undemocratic sore-loser behavior.[^73] This refusal to observe democratic norms set a troubling precedent for peaceful transitions of power in Indonesia's young democracy.

---

## Personal Life

Megawati has been married three times and has three children. Her first marriage in 1968 to First Lieutenant Surindro Supjarso produced two sons, Mohammad Rizki Pratama and Mohammad Prananda Prabowo.[^74] After Surindro's death in a 1970 plane crash, she briefly married Hassan Gamal AH in 1972, though this marriage was annulled shortly after.[^75]

Her most enduring marriage was to Taufiq Kiemas, whom she married on March 25, 1973.[^76] Kiemas was a figure close to Sukarno's ideological legacy and proved instrumental in encouraging Megawati's political career.[^77] After her presidency, Kiemas served as Speaker of the People's Consultative Assembly from 2009 until his death, becoming Indonesia's only first gentleman.[^78]

Taufiq Kiemas died on June 8, 2013, in Singapore General Hospital after a heart attack.[^79] He had suffered from heart and kidney problems, having had bypass surgery in Australia in 2000, an operation in 2005 to install a pacemaker, and another to replace the pacemaker battery.[^80] His body was flown back to Jakarta in an Indonesian Air Force Hercules cargo aircraft, where he was given a full state funeral and buried at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery.[^81]

Megawati and Kiemas had one daughter together, Puan Maharani, whom Megawati officially introduced to the public as her political successor on July 15, 2008.[^82] Puan Maharani has since become a prominent politician in her own right, serving in various ministerial positions and as Speaker of the People's Representative Council, continuing the Sukarno political dynasty into a third generation.

Megawati's personality has been described as quiet and reserved, with her quiet nature sometimes interpreted as serenity but by others as signs of being unprepared for leadership.[^83] Despite her relative lack of political experience when she entered politics, she was popular in part for her status as Sukarno's daughter and because she was seen as free of corruption with admirable personal qualities.[^84] Academic analyses noted she had feudal characteristics that made her resistant to criticism, reflecting traditional Javanese hierarchical values.[^85]

## Legacy

### Democratic Consolidation and Institutional Reform

Megawati Soekarnoputri's most enduring legacy is her role in stabilizing and consolidating Indonesian democracy during a critical transition period.[^86] By establishing direct presidential elections and passing constitutional amendments that strengthened democratic institutions, she fundamentally transformed Indonesia's political system despite the reforms ultimately leading to her own electoral defeat.[^87] The Constitutional Court she helped establish has become a crucial check on executive power, while the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK), despite its limitations, represents an important anti-corruption institution.[^88]

### PDI-P and Long-Term Political Influence

As PDI-P chairwoman since the party's founding, Megawati has shaped Indonesian politics for over three decades.[^89] PDI-P emerged from opposition to Suharto in 1996-1998 and has become one of Indonesia's major political parties, returning to power in 2014 when it nominated Joko Widodo (Jokowi) as presidential candidate.[^90] Since 2014, PDI-P has been the ruling and largest party in the House of Representatives.[^91]

However, Megawati's relationship with Jokowi deteriorated significantly, culminating in PDI-P formally expelling Jokowi and his family members on December 16, 2024, after he backed rival candidate Prabowo Subianto instead of PDI-P candidate Ganjar Pranowo in the 2024 presidential election.[^92] This dramatic break demonstrated both Megawati's continued control over PDI-P and the limits of her political influence over leaders who emerged from her party.[^93]

### Pancasila Ideology and Nationalism

As the daughter of Pancasila's creator, Megawati has been instrumental in rehabilitating and promoting Pancasila as Indonesia's state ideology.[^94] On March 22, 2018, she was appointed as Head of the Steering Committee of the Pancasila Ideology Development Agency (BPIP), with a clear intention to preserve the legacy of her father, Sukarno.[^95] PDI-P maintains a political stance of pluralism, humanity, democracy, and social welfare, adhering to the Pancasila version from June 1, 1945.[^96]

Megawati's era was characterized by "Moderate Nationalism," though she heavily relied on the military and adopted a more traditional (nativist) political style, reviving the language of deliberation and consensus and emphasizing "Eastern values" over liberal values.[^97] Reformist Muslim scholar Azyumardi Azra argued that Pancasila was Indonesia's only feasible ideological platform and should be rebuilt as a symbol of tolerance and pluralism, a vision Megawati has championed.[^98]

### Mixed Record on Human Rights and Governance

Megawati's legacy is significantly tarnished by the Aceh crisis and the complete failure to hold security forces accountable for human rights abuses.[^99] The martial law declaration and subsequent violations of human rights remain a dark chapter that undermines her democratic credentials.[^100] Her acknowledged failures in fighting corruption and her reputation for indecisiveness also complicate assessments of her presidency.[^101]

### Gender Breakthrough and Limitations

As Indonesia's first and only female president to date, Megawati broke a significant gender barrier in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation.[^102] However, she did not actively champion women's rights or use her position to advance feminist causes, and some observers noted she benefited more from her father's legacy than from any gender-progressive platform.[^103] Her presidency demonstrated both the possibility and limitations of female political leadership in Indonesia's patriarchal political culture.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and some scholars emphasize Megawati's crucial role in stabilizing Indonesian democracy during its most vulnerable period.[^104] A former adviser stated, "Megawati stabilized the country and oversaw its path to democracy," crediting her with providing much-needed political stability after the chaotic Wahid presidency.[^105] Her establishment of direct presidential elections is widely recognized as a fundamental democratic reform that has become a permanent feature of Indonesian politics.[^106]

Academic analyses of her leadership style acknowledge her charismatic leadership, which has been the subject of scholarly examination in Indonesian journals.[^107] Defenders note that despite her relative lack of political experience, she was popular for her status as Sukarno's daughter and was seen as free of corruption with admirable personal qualities.[^108] Her success in navigating Indonesia through the post-Bali bombing period and maintaining international cooperation against terrorism while leading the world's largest Muslim-majority nation is cited as evidence of diplomatic skill.[^109]

Supporters argue that Megawati's "Moderate Nationalism" provided ideological continuity with Indonesia's founding principles while adapting to democratic governance.[^110] Her commitment to Pancasila as a platform for tolerance and pluralism is viewed as crucial for maintaining Indonesia's diverse social fabric.[^111] The economic recovery during her tenure, with growth rates exceeding 7 percent and successful exit from IMF supervision, is credited as evidence of competent economic stewardship.[^112]

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize Megawati's indecisiveness, lack of clear ideological direction, and "reputation for inaction on important policy issues" as fundamental failures of leadership.[^113] Outside observers questioned her ability to become a world leader due to her lack of political experience, with her quiet nature interpreted as signs of being unprepared rather than serene.[^114] Academic assessments note she had feudal characteristics that made her resistant to criticism, reflecting problematic traditional hierarchical values incompatible with democratic governance.[^115]

The Aceh crisis remains the most damning criticism of her presidency. Human rights organizations and scholars condemned her government's failure to prosecute grave human rights violations for which government security forces were responsible, characterizing it as a systematic crimes against humanity with no judicial accountability.[^116] Her broken promise not to let "even a drop of blood spill in Tanah Rencong" is cited as evidence of political opportunism over principle.[^117]

Critics note that corruption continued to be pervasive during her presidency, with her own government acknowledging it had done little to stop corruption, estimating 20 percent of foreign aid loans were siphoned off annually.[^118] Her decision to halt prosecutions of private bankers who allegedly stole billions is viewed as evidence of protecting elite interests over reform.[^119] Her refusal to concede defeat, congratulate her successor, or attend Yudhoyono's inauguration is condemned as undemocratic behavior that set a troubling precedent.[^120]

Scholars critical of her presidency argue she appeared to see her role mainly as a symbol of national unity and rarely actively intervened in government business, suggesting she misunderstood the demands of democratic executive leadership.[^121] The characterization that her economic team "never developed a coherent policy" despite being composed of smart people reflects broader failures of strategic vision and leadership.[^122]
