## Summary

Chaleo Yoovidhya created Krating Daeng, the Thai energy drink that became the basis for Red Bull. He partnered with Dietrich Mateschitz to create the global Red Bull brand, with each owning a 49% stake (and Chaleo's son holding the remaining 2%). His innovation of combining caffeine, taurine, and B-vitamins in a sweet drink created an entirely new beverage category. He was Thailand's richest person at the time of his death.
