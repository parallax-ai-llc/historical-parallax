## Summary

Fujiwara no Morosuke (909-960), also known as Kujō-dono or Bōjō-udaijin, was a Japanese statesman, courtier, poet, and politician during the middle Heian period.[^1] As the second son of the powerful regent Fujiwara no Tadahira, Morosuke rose to the position of udaijin (Minister of the Right) and wielded significant political influence during Emperor Murakami's reign.[^2] Though he never attained the position of sekkan (regent) himself, his strategic marriage alliances and political acumen established his lineage as the dominant branch of the Fujiwara clan for generations.[^3] His five sons all achieved the rank of daijō-daijin (Grand Chancellor), and his descendants produced multiple emperors, cementing his legacy as one of the most consequential figures of the Heian period.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Fujiwara no Morosuke was born on January 11, 909, into the illustrious Northern House (Hokke) of the Fujiwara clan, the most powerful aristocratic family in Heian Japan.[^5] He was the second son of Fujiwara no Tadahira, who controlled the government for many years as sekkan (regent) and daijō-daijin, taking over the leadership of the Northern House branch in 909 when his elder brother Tokihira died.[^6] His older stepbrother was Fujiwara no Saneyori, with whom he would later share power and establish competing traditions of court protocol.[^7]

From his earliest years, Morosuke received an exceptional education befitting his status as the son of Japan's most powerful nobleman. Both Morosuke and Saneyori were personally educated by their father Tadahira in the intricate customs, ceremonies, and political practices of the imperial court.[^8] This rigorous training in yūsoku kojitsu (court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette) would prove instrumental in Morosuke's later career and his establishment of the Kujō school of court practices.[^9]

The Heian period during Morosuke's youth was characterized by the Fujiwara clan's increasing dominance over the imperial court through a sophisticated system of marrying daughters to emperors and serving as regents to their imperial grandsons.[^10] Growing up in this environment, Morosuke learned the intricate arts of political maneuvering, court ceremony, and the importance of family alliances that would define his career.[^11] The Northern House had perfected the strategy of controlling political power through the positions of sesshō (regent during an emperor's minority) and kampaku (chief advisor to an adult emperor), collectively known as sekkan.[^12]

Morosuke's early life coincided with significant political upheavals, including the Taira no Masakado rebellion in the eastern provinces, which tested the court's authority and provided opportunities for ambitious courtiers to demonstrate their political judgment.[^13] This formative period instilled in him both the refined cultural sensibilities of the Heian aristocracy and the ruthless political instincts necessary for survival and advancement in the cutthroat world of court politics.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Morosuke's ascent through the ranks of court nobility began in earnest in 931, when he embarked on a steady climb through the complex hierarchy of the imperial bureaucracy.[^15] From 931 to 947, he passed through the position of sangi (imperial advisor) and attained the post of provisional chūnagon (middle counselor), demonstrating both his administrative competence and political acumen.[^16]

A pivotal moment in Morosuke's rise came during the Taira no Masakado rebellion, when a memorable debate erupted at court over whether to reward Fujiwara no Tadabumi, who had been appointed as general to suppress the rebellion but arrived after it had already been quelled.[^17] Morosuke's older brother Saneyori argued that Tadabumi, having accomplished nothing, deserved no reward. Morosuke countered that because Tadabumi had accepted imperial orders and departed the capital to serve, he should still be honored.[^18] Though Saneyori maintained his position, public opinion favored Morosuke's more generous interpretation.[^19] This victory in the court of public opinion led to Morosuke's promotion to dainagon (major counselor), appointment as a general in the imperial guard, and bestowal of the junior second rank.[^20]

The critical turning point in Morosuke's career arrived in 947 when Emperor Suzaku abdicated and Emperor Murakami ascended to the throne.[^21] Morosuke had strategically married his eldest daughter, Fujiwara no Anshi, to Murakami while he was still crown prince—a calculated move that would prove extraordinarily successful.[^22] When Murakami became emperor, Saneyori was appointed sadaijin (Minister of the Left) while Morosuke was appointed udaijin (Minister of the Right) and promoted to shōnii (senior second rank).[^23]

Despite holding a nominally subordinate position to his brother, in reality Morosuke held actual control of the imperial court.[^24] When Anshi gave birth to a son—the future Emperor Reizei—she was elevated to chūgū (empress), and Morosuke's position as the maternal grandfather of the crown prince gave him unprecedented influence.[^25] For approximately ten years, Morosuke and his cohorts were able to lead the court alongside Emperor Murakami, exercising real political power that exceeded even that of his older brother Saneyori.[^26]

Morosuke further deepened his ties to the imperial family through multiple strategic marriages. After the death of his wife Princess Kinshi, he married Princess Gashi, and after her death, Princess Yasuko—all daughters of Emperor Daigo.[^27] These successive marriages to imperial princesses reinforced his family's intimate connection to the throne and demonstrated the importance he placed on maintaining blood ties to the imperial line.[^28]

## Major Achievements

### Political Administration and Court Governance

Fujiwara no Morosuke's primary achievement was his effective governance as udaijin during Emperor Murakami's reign, supporting the court's administration while being recognized as a learned scholar thoroughly versed in court customs.[^29] His reputation for uprightness and wisdom earned him the respect of fellow courtiers, and he became known for his balanced judgment in political matters.[^30] Unlike many court nobles who focused solely on accumulating personal power, Morosuke demonstrated genuine administrative competence and a commitment to proper governance according to traditional protocols.[^31]

### Establishment of the Kujō School

One of Morosuke's most enduring accomplishments was the establishment of the Kujō-ryū, a comprehensive school of court practices and ceremonial traditions that would be transmitted through his descendants for centuries.[^32] Morosuke meticulously recorded the practices of his school in a book called the Kujō Nenchū-gyōji (Nine-Article Annual Observances), which documented the proper procedures for court ceremonies and annual events.[^33] This systematic codification of court protocol served as an authoritative reference that helped standardize and preserve the complex traditions of the imperial court.[^34]

In parallel, his brother Saneyori established the Ononomiya-ryū, creating two competing but complementary traditions of court practice within the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan.[^35] Both schools were based on the teachings they received from their father Tadahira, but each brother developed distinct emphases and interpretations that would characterize their respective family lines.[^36]

### Literary and Cultural Contributions

Beyond politics, Morosuke distinguished himself as an accomplished poet, leaving behind a personal collection simply titled Morosuke-shū.[^37] His literary talents were recognized during his lifetime, with thirty-six of his poems included in the prestigious imperial anthology Gosen Wakashū, making him one of the principal poets represented in that collection.[^38] The Gosen Wakashū, compiled in 951 at Emperor Murakami's behest, contained 1,426 poems across twenty volumes, and Morosuke, along with Fujiwara no Saneyori and Fujiwara no Atsutada, was among the poets with the most poems included.[^39]

### The Kyūreki Diary

Morosuke maintained a detailed personal diary known as the Kyūreki, an invaluable historical document that provides insights into court life, political deliberations, and administrative practices during the mid-Heian period.[^40] Although the original diary has been lost, we know its contents through several derived sources: an abridgement of entries from 947-949 and 957-960 (Kyūreki shō), classified records of grand banquets and festivals from 932-960 (Kujō-dono ki), records of his father Tadahira's ordinances from 936-946 (Kyūrekiki), a fragmentary text from 941 (Kyūreki dankan), and fragments preserved in other diaries.[^41] This documentation represented not merely personal record-keeping but a conscious effort to preserve knowledge of court practices for future generations.[^42]

### Dynastic Success Through Strategic Marriages

Morosuke's greatest achievement may have been establishing a family dynasty that dominated Japanese politics for generations. His daughter Fujiwara no Anshi managed to acquire great influence over Emperor Murakami and has been called the most influential woman of the imperial court for twenty years.[^43] She gave birth to two princes who became Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'yū, establishing Morosuke's descendants as the maternal relatives of multiple emperors.[^44]

Furthermore, his second daughter Fujiwara no Tōshi also became a concubine of Emperor Murakami, though her affair with the emperor was curtailed by Anshi's disapproval and only resumed after her sister's death in 964.[^45] Through these daughters and their imperial offspring, Morosuke positioned his family line for unprecedented dominance in the following generations.

### Sons Who Became Chancellors

Remarkably, five of Morosuke's sons—Koretada, Kanemichi, Kaneie, Tamemitsu, and Kinsue—all attained the position of daijō-daijin (Grand Chancellor), the highest rank in the bureaucracy.[^46] His eldest son Koretada served as sesshō (regent), while Kanemichi and Kaneie also held the positions of regent and kampaku at different times.[^47] This extraordinary achievement of having multiple sons reach the pinnacle of political power was unparalleled in Japanese history and demonstrated both Morosuke's political acumen and the advantageous position he had secured for his family.[^48]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Rivalry and Factionalism with Brother Saneyori

While Morosuke and his brother Saneyori were both educated by their father and served together in government, their relationship was characterized by political rivalry that contributed to factionalism within the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan.[^49] Each established separate factions—Saneyori's Onomiya line and Morosuke's Kujō line—and these divisions were passed down to their descendants, creating enduring political splits within the family.[^50] This internal competition, while perhaps inevitable given the high-stakes nature of court politics, weakened the clan's unity and contributed to future power struggles.[^51]

The debate over rewards for Fujiwara no Tadabumi during the Taira no Masakado rebellion illustrated the philosophical differences between the brothers, with Saneyori taking a strict meritocratic position and Morosuke favoring a more generous interpretation that valued intention and service over results.[^52] While Morosuke's position prevailed in public opinion, the disagreement highlighted the lack of consensus even among the Fujiwara leadership on fundamental questions of governance and reward.[^53]

### Perpetuation of Fujiwara Monopoly

Morosuke's career exemplified and perpetuated the Fujiwara clan's monopoly over high government offices during the Heian period, a system that faced criticism for limiting social mobility and concentrating power in a single family.[^54] The Fujiwara monopolized the posts of sesshō and kampaku from the 10th through 11th century, determining general affairs of state including imperial succession.[^55] This concentration of power in hereditary positions, rather than merit-based advancement, represented a structural weakness in the political system.[^56]

Younger members of the imperial family and lower-ranking aristocrats dissatisfied with the Fujiwara monopoly were forced to seek posts as local officials in the provinces, where they established their own power bases away from the capital.[^57] While Morosuke himself was known for his competence and uprightness, his very success reinforced a system that prevented talented individuals from outside the Fujiwara clan from achieving their potential.[^58]

### Administrative Limitations and Economic Mismanagement

While Morosuke was personally competent, the Fujiwara clan as a whole during this period has been criticized as less-than-capable administrators who allowed the Japanese economy to deteriorate.[^59] By the year 1000, the government no longer knew how to issue currency, and money was gradually disappearing from circulation.[^60] Though Morosuke died in 960 before the worst effects became apparent, his focus on maintaining political power through marriage alliances and court intrigue rather than addressing fundamental economic and administrative challenges contributed to these systemic failures.[^61]

### Bitter Succession Struggles Among Sons

Despite Morosuke's success in positioning all five of his major sons for high office, the succession among them was marked by bitter hatred, particularly between Kanemichi and Kaneie.[^62] When Koretada died in 972, Kanemichi was elevated to the offices of nadaijin and kampaku, with his chief rival being his younger brother Kaneie.[^63] This fraternal conflict destabilized court politics and demonstrated that Morosuke's political legacy included not just power but also the seeds of destructive family rivalry.[^64]

The intense competition among his sons meant that the Kujō-ryū school of court practices that Morosuke had carefully established did not function effectively as a unified tradition during the next generation, as his children were heavily involved in power struggles.[^65] This undermined one of Morosuke's key cultural achievements and showed the limitations of his ability to ensure harmonious succession.[^66]

### Reinforcement of Gender Inequality

Morosuke's strategic use of his daughters as political tools—marrying them to emperors and princes to secure his family's position—exemplified the instrumental treatment of women in Heian court politics.[^67] While Fujiwara no Anshi achieved considerable personal influence, her primary value to her father was as a means of producing imperial grandsons who would secure the family's political dominance.[^68] This system reduced women to pawns in dynastic chess games, reinforcing gender hierarchies that limited women's autonomy and agency.[^69]

---

## Personal Life

### Family and Marriages

Fujiwara no Morosuke's personal life was deeply intertwined with his political ambitions, as was typical for Heian aristocrats. He contracted multiple marriages to imperial princesses, demonstrating the strategic importance of maintaining close blood ties to the imperial family.[^70] He first married Princess Kinshi, daughter of Emperor Daigo, and after her death married her sister Princess Gashi, and later Princess Yasuko, also a daughter of Emperor Daigo.[^71] These successive marriages to three sisters from the imperial house illustrated both the acceptable practice of levirate-like arrangements among the aristocracy and Morosuke's determination to maintain his privileged access to imperial bloodlines.[^72]

Beyond his imperial marriages, Morosuke fathered numerous children who would shape Japanese political history. His daughters included Fujiwara no Anshi (927-964), who became Emperor Murakami's primary consort and bore two future emperors, and Fujiwara no Tōshi (?-975), who married Prince Shigeakira and also became a concubine of Emperor Murakami.[^73] His five prominent sons—Koretada (924-972), Kanemichi (925-977), Kaneie (c. 929-990), Tamemitsu, and Kinsue—all achieved the highest ranks of court nobility, creating an unprecedented family dynasty.[^74]

### Personality and Character

Contemporary sources describe Morosuke as a learned scholar respected by other courtiers for his uprightness and thorough knowledge of court customs.[^75] Unlike some aristocrats who relied purely on family connections, Morosuke cultivated genuine expertise in the complex protocols and traditions that governed court life, earning him a reputation for competence and wisdom.[^76] His position as udaijin during Emperor Murakami's reign was not merely ceremonial; he actively supported the court's government and exercised real political authority.[^77]

The debate over rewarding Fujiwara no Tadabumi during the Taira no Masakado rebellion revealed Morosuke's more generous and pragmatic approach to political questions, contrasting with his brother Saneyori's stricter interpretation.[^78] Morosuke's argument that intention and service deserved recognition even without tangible results suggested a more humane and politically savvy personality that understood the importance of maintaining morale and loyalty among the warrior class.[^79]

### Cultural Interests and Intellectual Pursuits

Morosuke was not merely a politician but a cultured intellectual deeply engaged with the literary and artistic traditions of his time. As an accomplished poet, he produced works collected in the Morosuke-shū and gained recognition through the inclusion of dozens of his poems in the imperial Gosen Wakashū anthology.[^80] This literary achievement placed him among the era's most celebrated poets and demonstrated that he embodied the Heian aristocratic ideal of combining political power with cultural refinement.[^81]

His maintenance of the detailed Kyūreki diary and his compilation of the Kujō Nenchū-gyōji revealed a scholarly temperament concerned with preserving knowledge and traditions for posterity.[^82] These works showed Morosuke's recognition that cultural and ceremonial knowledge constituted a form of power and legitimacy as important as political office.[^83]

### Final Illness and Death

In 960, Morosuke was stricken by a serious illness that would prove fatal. Following the customs of the time for dying aristocrats, he attempted to cut his hair and take the tonsure (become a Buddhist monk) to prepare for death and hopefully secure merit in the afterlife.[^84] Emperor Murakami, demonstrating the personal bond between the emperor and his minister and father-in-law, sent a messenger to dissuade him from taking this step.[^85] Despite the emperor's intervention, Morosuke's condition worsened. On May 29, 960, he finally cut off his hair, and two days later, on May 31, 960, he died at the age of 53.[^86]

The emperor's attempt to prevent Morosuke from taking the tonsure illustrated not only their personal relationship but also Murakami's recognition that Morosuke's service as a lay official was more valuable to the realm than his prayers as a monk.[^87] Morosuke's death marked the end of an era of relatively stable cooperation between the Fujiwara leadership and the throne, as the succeeding generation would engage in more destructive internecine conflicts.[^88]

## Legacy

### Foundation of the Dominant Fujiwara Line

Although Fujiwara no Morosuke never held the position of sekkan (regent) during his lifetime, his legacy far exceeded that of many who did attain that office.[^89] The successive reigns of his grandchildren Emperor Reizei and Emperor En'yū after Emperor Murakami's death placed his family in an outstanding position as the emperor's maternal relatives, fulfilling the classic Fujiwara strategy for political dominance.[^90] His eldest son Koretada briefly held power as sekkan, and his other sons Kanemichi, Kaneie, Tamemitsu, and Kinsue all attained the position of daijō-daijin, creating an unprecedented concentration of the highest offices within a single family line.[^91]

The line of regents descended from Morosuke's children, establishing his branch as the dominant lineage within the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan.[^92] This dominance would reach its apex with his great-grandson Fujiwara no Michinaga (966-1028), who married four daughters to four successive emperors and whose three sons became emperors, representing the high-water mark of Fujiwara power.[^93] Thus, Morosuke's strategic positioning and political acumen created the foundation for the most powerful political dynasty in Japanese history.[^94]

### Cultural and Institutional Contributions

Morosuke's establishment of the Kujō-ryū school of court practices had lasting influence on Japanese ceremonial and administrative traditions.[^95] Though the school struggled during his sons' generation due to their power struggles, it was revived by later descendants and continued as an authoritative tradition of yūsoku kojitsu (court ceremony and etiquette) that influenced Japanese court culture for centuries.[^96] The Kujō school represented a systematic codification of the complex protocols that governed aristocratic life, preserving knowledge that might otherwise have been lost.[^97]

His literary works, particularly his poems included in the Gosen Wakashū, contributed to the development of classical Japanese poetry during a golden age of literary achievement.[^98] The Heian period saw the flowering of indigenous Japanese cultural forms, and Morosuke's participation in this literary culture helped establish the aristocratic ideal that valued both political power and refined artistic sensibility.[^99]

### Historical Documentation

The Kyūreki diary and its derivative texts remain valuable primary sources for understanding mid-Heian court life, political decision-making, and administrative practices.[^100] The Kujō-dono Ikai (Nine-Article Testament), the dying instructions Morosuke left for his descendants, preserved his wisdom and political philosophy for future generations.[^101] These documents provide modern historians with detailed insights into the workings of the Heian court and the mindset of its ruling class.[^102]

### Political Philosophy and Governance Model

Morosuke's career exemplified a particular approach to political power that emphasized strategic family alliances, mastery of court protocol and tradition, and the careful balance between serving the emperor and advancing family interests.[^103] His success in elevating his family without triggering imperial backlash demonstrated sophisticated political judgment and restraint.[^104] The debate with Saneyori over rewarding Tadabumi showed his understanding that political authority required not just formal power but also public support and the appearance of generosity and justice.[^105]

His legacy included both the strengthening of the Fujiwara monopoly system and the seeds of its eventual decline, as the intense rivalries among his sons previewed the destructive family conflicts that would eventually weaken the clan's grip on power.[^106] The retired emperor (insei) system that later emperors developed to circumvent Fujiwara control was partly a response to the overwhelming dominance that Morosuke's line achieved.[^107]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern historians and classical sources alike have generally viewed Fujiwara no Morosuke favorably as one of the most competent and cultured members of the Heian aristocracy.[^108] Scholars praise his genuine administrative abilities and his mastery of court protocols, noting that he was "considered a learned scholar and well-versed in the customs of the court."[^109] Unlike some Fujiwara leaders who relied purely on family connections and political maneuvering, Morosuke demonstrated real expertise that earned him contemporary respect.[^110]

Japanese historians emphasize Morosuke's cultural contributions, particularly his establishment of the Kujō-ryū school of court practices and his literary achievements.[^111] The fact that thirty-six of his poems were included in an imperial anthology indicates that his contemporaries recognized genuine poetic talent, not merely political influence.[^112] His maintenance of the Kyūreki diary and compilation of ceremonial guides showed intellectual seriousness and concern for preserving cultural knowledge.[^113]

Scholars of Heian literature and culture value the documentation Morosuke left behind, which provides crucial insights into mid-tenth-century court life.[^114] His Kujō-dono Ikai (Nine-Article Testament) is studied as an example of aristocratic wisdom literature, offering guidance on governance, family management, and moral conduct.[^115] The survival of these texts through various derivative works demonstrates that later generations found them sufficiently valuable to preserve and copy.[^116]

Historians also credit Morosuke with political wisdom in his handling of the Tadabumi reward controversy, where his more generous position prevailed over his brother's stricter interpretation.[^117] This incident is sometimes cited as evidence of Morosuke's understanding that effective governance required not just adherence to formal rules but also attention to morale, loyalty, and public opinion.[^118] His ability to balance political ambition with service to the emperor is seen as a model of successful court nobility.[^119]

Some scholars argue that Morosuke's success in establishing his family line as dominant within the Fujiwara clan represented a triumph of strategic planning and political acumen that benefited from but also contributed to the relative stability of Emperor Murakami's reign.[^120] His close cooperation with the emperor, facilitated by family ties but maintained through competent service, created a functional partnership that allowed for effective governance during his tenure as udaijin.[^121]

### Negative Views

Critics of Fujiwara no Morosuke focus primarily on his role in perpetuating and strengthening the Fujiwara monopoly over high offices, which limited social mobility and concentrated power in ways that ultimately harmed Japanese governance.[^122] While Morosuke himself may have been competent, the system he reinforced prevented talented individuals from outside the Fujiwara clan from achieving positions where they could contribute to the realm.[^123] This hereditary monopoly, critics argue, represented a structural flaw that Morosuke did nothing to address and actively worked to strengthen.[^124]

Historians critical of the Fujiwara dominance note that the clan's focus on political intrigue and marriage alliances came at the expense of addressing fundamental economic and administrative challenges.[^125] While this criticism applies more broadly to the Fujiwara clan than to Morosuke specifically, as udaijin during Emperor Murakami's reign he bore responsibility for the government's failures to address deteriorating economic conditions.[^126] The fact that by the year 1000 the government no longer knew how to issue currency reflected decades of administrative neglect that began during Morosuke's era.[^127]

Some scholars point to the bitter rivalries among Morosuke's sons as evidence that his political legacy was problematic.[^128] The hatred between Kanemichi and Kaneie and their destructive power struggles destabilized court politics and demonstrated that Morosuke failed to instill values of cooperation and family unity in his children.[^129] While he successfully positioned them for high office, he did not create a framework for harmonious succession that would have served the realm better.[^130]

Feminist historians criticize Morosuke's instrumental use of his daughters as political tools, marrying them strategically to emperors and princes to advance family interests.[^131] While such practices were typical of the era, Morosuke's particular success in this strategy reinforced a system that treated women primarily as vehicles for producing imperial heirs and securing political advantage.[^132] Even Fujiwara no Anshi, who achieved considerable personal influence, was valued fundamentally for her reproductive capacity and her ability to produce imperial grandsons.[^133]

Critics also note that Morosuke's establishment of the Kujō school of court practices, while culturally significant, contributed to the increasingly elaborate and expensive ceremonialism that characterized Heian court life.[^134] The proliferation of complex protocols and the emphasis on knowing proper ceremonial forms diverted aristocratic attention and resources away from practical governance.[^135] The competition between the Kujō and Ononomiya schools created additional factionalism within the Fujiwara clan that had political ramifications beyond mere ceremonial differences.[^136]

Some modern historians argue that Morosuke's very success in elevating his family line set a precedent that encouraged ever-more-aggressive pursuit of power through marriage politics, contributing to the system's eventual dysfunction.[^137] The extraordinary achievement of having five sons reach the rank of daijō-daijin created unrealistic expectations and intensified competition in subsequent generations.[^138] His legacy thus included not just Fujiwara dominance but also the mechanisms that would eventually undermine that dominance through excessive ambition and internal conflict.[^139]

## Famous Quotes

While specific verbatim quotes from Fujiwara no Morosuke are scarce in available English-language sources, the historical record preserves several of his positions and documented statements:

> "As Tadabumi had accepted his orders and set out from the capital, he should still be rewarded."

*Morosuke's argument during the court debate following the Taira no Masakado rebellion, advocating for rewarding service and intention even without tangible battlefield accomplishment. This position, which prevailed over his brother Saneyori's stricter meritocratic view, demonstrated Morosuke's more generous political philosophy.*[^140]

The Kujō-dono Ikai (Nine-Article Testament) that Morosuke left as dying instructions for his descendants would have contained his wisdom on governance, family management, and proper conduct, though the specific text is not widely available in translation.[^141]

His poetry included in the Gosen Wakashū represents his literary voice, though individual poems are not extensively quoted in general historical sources. His thirty-six poems in that imperial anthology demonstrated the refined aesthetic sensibility expected of Heian aristocrats.[^142]

The Kyūreki diary, though fragmentary, preserved Morosuke's observations on court life, political deliberations, and administrative matters, providing historians with his contemporary perspective on mid-tenth-century events.[^143]

His compilation of the Kujō Nenchū-gyōji codified his understanding of proper court ceremonial practices, representing his vision of how aristocratic traditions should be performed and transmitted.[^144]
