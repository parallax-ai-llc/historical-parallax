## Overview

The French Revolution (1789-1799) was the most transformative political upheaval in modern European history. It began with the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, overthrew the centuries-old Bourbon monarchy, executed King Louis XVI, and attempted to rebuild French society based on Enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The Revolution descended into the Reign of Terror (1793-1794), which guillotined 40,000+, before giving way to the Directory, then Napoleon's empire. The Revolution's principles—popular sovereignty, human rights, nationalism—spread across Europe and the world, fundamentally reshaping politics, society, and ideas for centuries to come.

## Background

### Ancien Régime

**Three Estates:**
1. **First Estate:** Clergy (~130,000) - Paid almost no taxes
2. **Second Estate:** Nobility (~300,000) - Paid almost no taxes
3. **Third Estate:** Everyone else (~27 million) - Paid nearly all taxes

**Inequality:**
1-2% owned 30% of land. Peasants taxed heavily while supporting privileged classes.

### Causes

**Financial Crisis:**
- France bankrupt from wars (including American Revolution support)
- Extravagant court spending (Versailles)
- Ineffective taxation (exempted privileged classes)

**Enlightenment Ideas:**
Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu spread ideas of:
- Natural rights
- Social contract
- Popular sovereignty
- Separation of powers

**Food Crisis:**
Bad harvests (1788-1789). Bread prices soared. Hunger and anger in streets.
