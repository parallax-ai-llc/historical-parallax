## Summary

Walter Alvarez is an American geologist who, with his father Luis, proposed the asteroid impact theory for the extinction of the dinosaurs in 1980. Their discovery of anomalously high iridium levels in the K-T boundary clay suggested a massive asteroid impact 66 million years ago. The Chicxulub crater was later found in Mexico, confirming their theory.
