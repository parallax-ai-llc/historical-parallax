## Summary

Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) was a French magistrate and mathematician who is widely regarded as the founder of modern number theory. Despite pursuing mathematics only as a hobby alongside his professional career as a lawyer at the Parlement of Toulouse, he made groundbreaking contributions to number theory, probability, analytic geometry, calculus, and optics. He is best known for Fermat's Last Theorem, which remained unproven for 358 years until Andrew Wiles solved it in 1994. Together with René Descartes, Fermat was one of the two leading mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Pierre de Fermat was born on August 17, 1601, in Beaumont-de-Lomagne, France, though some historical uncertainty surrounds the exact date—his tombstone lists 1608, and some sources cite 1607, which recent research suggests may have been the birth year of a half-brother also named Pierre.[^3][^4] His father, Dominique Fermat, was a prosperous leather merchant who served as second consul of the town, while his mother, Claire de Long, brought the social status of the parliamentary noblesse de robe.[^5][^6] Pierre had one brother, Clément, and two sisters, Louise and Marie. He was almost certainly raised in his birthplace at the Franciscan monastery where he received his early education.[^7]

Fermat attended the University of Orléans beginning in 1623, where he studied civil law and received a bachelor's degree in 1626.[^8] After completing his formal education, he moved to Bordeaux, where he began his first serious mathematical researches and connected with the mathematical community there. In 1629, while in Bordeaux, he gave a copy of his restoration of Apollonius's Plane loci to one of the mathematicians in that city, marking the beginning of his mathematical correspondence.[^9] His education equipped him with classical languages—he was a skilled Latinist and Hellenist—and a deep appreciation for ancient mathematical texts, particularly the works of Diophantus and Apollonius, which would profoundly influence his later work.[^10]

The young Fermat's combination of legal training and mathematical passion set the stage for his unique career trajectory. Unlike most mathematicians of his era who held academic positions, Fermat would pursue mathematics entirely as an avocation, conducting his research in the margins of his legal career.[^11]

## Rise to Prominence

In 1630, Fermat purchased the office of councilor at the Parlement de Toulouse, one of the High Courts of Judicature in France, and was sworn in by the Grand Chambre in May 1631.[^12] This appointment not only launched his professional legal career but also entitled him to change his name from Pierre Fermat to Pierre de Fermat, reflecting his new social status.[^13] In June 1631, shortly after his appointment, the 30-year-old Fermat married his fourth cousin, Louise de Long, who was only 15 years old at the time. The couple would eventually have eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood.[^14][^15]

Fermat's rise through the judicial ranks was steady and impressive. From his initial appointment in the lower chamber of parliament on May 14, 1631, he advanced to a higher chamber on January 16, 1638, and by 1652 had been promoted to the highest level of the criminal court.[^16] He held this prestigious position for the remainder of his life, balancing his demanding judicial responsibilities with his passionate pursuit of mathematics.

Simultaneously, Fermat's mathematical reputation began to spread through the scholarly networks of 17th-century Europe. Pierre de Carcavi, who like Fermat was a counselor in the Parliament of Toulouse, introduced him to the correspondence circle of Father Marin Mersenne in 1636.[^17] Mersenne served as the central hub for European mathematical communication, and through this network, Fermat engaged with the leading mathematicians of his time, including René Descartes, Blaise Pascal, Gilles Personne de Roberval, and others. By 1636, Fermat had already circulated his groundbreaking work on analytic geometry, "Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam et de tangentibus linearum curvarum" (Method for Finding Maxima and Minima and Tangents to Curved Lines), in manuscript form—predating the publication of Descartes' famous La Géométrie by a year.[^18]

Unlike many of his contemporaries, Fermat deliberately avoided seeking fame or publication. He avoided distinction adroitly, gaining stability and leisure that allowed him to pursue mathematics as his true interest.[^19] This solitary pursuit set him apart as a man who balanced briefs by day and theorems by night.[^20] Despite his reluctance to publish, his ideas spread through his extensive correspondence, and by the late 1630s and early 1640s, he was recognized among the mathematical elite of Europe as an original and powerful thinker.

## Major Achievements

### Number Theory

Fermat's most enduring legacy lies in number theory, where he is often called the founder of modern number theory, having virtually invented the field single-handedly.[^21][^22] His contributions were so extensive and profound that they shaped the direction of mathematical research for centuries. In 1640, he stated what became known as Fermat's Little Theorem: if p is prime and a is any whole number, then p divides evenly into a^p − a.[^23] It was while researching perfect numbers that he discovered this theorem, which today forms a cornerstone of number theory and modern cryptography, particularly in testing large prime numbers and protecting credit card transactions on the Internet.[^24][^25]

Fermat developed the two-square theorem (also known as Fermat's Christmas Theorem because he wrote an elaborate version in a letter to Marin Mersenne dated December 25, 1640), which states that an odd prime p can be expressed as a sum of two squares if and only if p ≡ 1 (mod 4).[^26][^27] He also formulated the polygonal number theorem in 1638, stating that every positive integer is a sum of at most n n-gonal numbers—meaning every number can be written as the sum of three or fewer triangular numbers, four or fewer square numbers, five or fewer pentagonal numbers, and so on.[^28][^29]

In number theory, Fermat studied Pell's equation, perfect numbers, amicable numbers, and what would later become Fermat numbers.[^30] He invented Fermat's factorization method and popularized the proof by infinite descent, a powerful technique he used to prove Fermat's right triangle theorem, which states that the area of a right triangle with integer sides can never equal the square of an integer.[^31][^32] This result includes as a corollary Fermat's Last Theorem for the case n=4.

### Fermat's Last Theorem

The achievement for which Fermat is most famous is paradoxically one he never proved himself. Around 1637, Fermat wrote in the margin of his copy of Diophantus's Arithmetica: "It is impossible for a cube to be a sum of two cubes, a fourth power to be a sum of two fourth powers, or in general for any number that is a power greater than the second to be the sum of two like powers."[^33] He then added his most famous words: "I have discovered a truly remarkable proof of this, which however the margin is too small to contain."[^34][^35]

This marginal note became Fermat's Last Theorem, which beguiled mathematicians for over 350 years.[^36] After Fermat's death in 1665, his son Clement-Samuel discovered this note, and the theorem remained one of mathematics' greatest unsolved problems until Andrew Wiles, with help from Richard Taylor, finally proved it in 1994-1995 by accomplishing a partial proof of the modularity theorem for elliptic curves.[^37][^38] Wiles's proof was published in May 1995 in the Annals of Mathematics and was described by John Coates as "one of the highest achievements of number theory" and by John Conway as "the proof of the century."[^39][^40]

### Analytic Geometry

Independently of René Descartes, Fermat discovered the fundamental principle of analytic geometry.[^41] In his paper "Ad Locos Planos et Solidos Isagoge" (Introduction to Plane and Solid Loci), written in 1636, Fermat formulated the fundamental principle: "Whenever two unknown quantities are found in final equality, there results a locus fixed in place."[^42] He considered equations among two variables, with one variable representing a line measured horizontally from a given initial point and the other representing a second line positioned at the end of the first line.[^43] Fermat was the first to postulate a space of three dimensions, thereby laying the basis for modern multidimensional analytic geometry.[^44]

The key difference between Fermat's and Descartes' approaches was philosophical: Fermat always started with an algebraic equation and then described the geometric curve that satisfied it, whereas Descartes started with geometric curves and produced their equations.[^45] Despite Descartes receiving more historical credit, Fermat's work in analytic geometry predated the publication of La Géométrie by a year.

### Calculus and the Method of Adequality

In his "Methodus ad disquirendam maximam et minimam," Fermat developed a method called adequality for determining maxima, minima, and tangents to various curves that was equivalent to differential calculus.[^46] The method of adequality involved assuming, counterfactually, the inequality of two equal roots to determine a relation between those roots and one of the coefficients of the polynomial, then removing the counterfactual assumption and setting the roots equal to arrive at an extreme-value solution.[^47] Fermat borrowed the term "adequality" from Diophantus, and this technique became a crucial step in solving problems that modern mathematicians would address using infinitesimal calculus.[^48]

Isaac Newton himself acknowledged Fermat's influence, writing that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from "Fermat's way of drawing tangents."[^49] Although Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz are credited with inventing calculus, Fermat's work significantly influenced its development, and his techniques were clear precursors to modern concepts of derivatives and integrals.[^50]

### Probability Theory

Through their correspondence in 1654, Fermat and Blaise Pascal helped lay the foundation for the theory of probability.[^51] From this brief but productive collaboration on the "problem of points" (a gambling problem concerning how to divide stakes fairly when a game is interrupted), they are now regarded as joint founders of probability theory.[^52][^53] Over several weeks between July and October 1654, their legendary correspondence established concepts still taught in modern statistics and data science.[^54]

### Optics

In a letter to La Chambre dated January 1, 1662, Fermat proposed his principle of least time, which states that the path taken by a ray of light between two given points is the path that can be traveled in the least time.[^55][^56] Applying his method of maxima and minima and assuming that light travels less slowly in denser media, Fermat showed that the law of refraction (Snell's law) follows from this principle, provided that light traveled more slowly in the optically denser medium.[^57][^58]

Fermat's principle, also known as the principle of least time, became the link between ray optics and wave optics and set the precedent for the principle of least action in classical mechanics.[^59] The principle remains fundamental in optics and mechanics, influencing the development of theories about light and wave propagation to this day.[^60]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Disputes with René Descartes

The most bitter controversy of Fermat's career involved his disputes with René Descartes, the other mathematical giant of their era. In spring 1638, Fermat's method of maxima and minima formed the central issue in an acrid debate between the two men, with Descartes trying to show that Fermat's methods were "paralogistic in their reasoning and limited in their application."[^61] The conflict escalated when Fermat criticized Descartes' work on the law of refraction, accusing it of being based on "circular reasoning" and claiming Descartes was "groping about in shadows."[^62]

Although the two men made formal peace in summer 1638 when Descartes admitted his error, the bitterness of the dispute, exacerbated by Descartes's hatred for Fermat's friend Roberval, poisoned any chance for cooperation between the two greatest mathematicians of the time.[^63] Descartes even attempted to diminish Fermat's reputation as a mathematician, and the rivalry between these intellectual giants prevented what could have been a fruitful collaboration.[^64]

### Priority Disputes

Secrecy was common in European mathematical circles of the 17th century, which naturally led to priority disputes with contemporaries such as Descartes and John Wallis.[^65] Fermat's refusal to accept fractional solutions to problems he set in 1657 as challenges to the European mathematics community initiated his dispute with Wallis, Frénicle de Bessy, and others, as it represented a break with the classical tradition of Diophantus's Arithmetica.[^66] These disputes reflected the competitive and sometimes contentious nature of 17th-century mathematical circles, where priority claims and methodological differences often led to bitter controversies.

### Incomplete Proofs and Skepticism

One of the most significant criticisms of Fermat concerns his claims to have proven theorems without providing the proofs. Although Fermat claimed to have proven all his arithmetic theorems, few records of his proofs have survived.[^67] Many mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, doubted several of his claims, especially given the difficulty of some problems and the limited mathematical methods available to Fermat in the 17th century.[^68] His proofs were often incomplete or non-existent, leaving subsequent generations of mathematicians to verify or expand upon his ideas.[^69]

The most famous example is, of course, Fermat's Last Theorem itself. The fact that it took 358 years and sophisticated 20th-century mathematical techniques unavailable to Fermat to prove the theorem has led many scholars to conclude that Fermat either made an error in believing he had a proof or was exaggerating for effect.[^70] This tendency to announce results without proof was both a strength and weakness: while it inspired centuries of mathematical exploration, it also created frustration among his contemporaries who could not verify his claims.

### Reluctance to Publish

Fermat's deliberate refusal to publish his work systematically has been criticized by historians of mathematics. Except for a few isolated papers, Fermat published nothing in his lifetime and gave no systematic exposition of his methods.[^71] While he enjoyed the pleasure of discovery more than any reputation it might gain him, this reluctance meant that many of his discoveries were paralleled by other workers, and it would be easy to dismiss him as interesting but not particularly significant.[^72] The lack of formal publication also meant that his full contributions were not immediately recognized by the broader mathematical community.

## Personal Life

In June 1631, shortly after purchasing his position at the Parlement de Toulouse, the 30-year-old Pierre de Fermat married his fourth cousin, Louise de Long, who was only 15 years old at the time—a marriage arrangement typical of their social class and era.[^73] The couple had eight children together, though only five survived to adulthood: two sons and three daughters.[^74][^75] Their elder son, Samuel, followed in his father's footsteps and became a magistrate and councilor in the Toulouse High Court. Their younger son took holy orders and became a canon in the cathedral church in Castres. Of their daughters, one married while two became nuns.[^76]

Despite his intellectual brilliance, Fermat was reputedly a quiet, friendly, and kindly man whose successful public life was paralleled by a happy family life.[^77] These outward details of Fermat's family life suggest that it followed the standard pattern for men of his social status in 17th-century France.[^78] He managed to balance his demanding professional responsibilities as a high-ranking judicial official with his mathematical pursuits and family obligations, a testament to his exceptional discipline and time management.

Fermat faced a life-threatening crisis during the plague of 1651-1653 that swept through Toulouse. He contracted the plague during this epidemic, which had near-fatal consequences, and his death was incorrectly reported in 1653.[^79][^80] The erroneous death reports were soon corrected, but the plague significantly weakened him. Nevertheless, he recovered and continued both his judicial work and mathematical research for another twelve years.

This brush with mortality may have intensified his mathematical work during his later years, though he maintained his characteristic reluctance to publish or seek recognition. He preferred to work in solitude, conducting research in his spare time away from his legal duties. With no academic peers at his elbow, he engaged with the mathematical community primarily through correspondence, exchanging ideas with scholars across Europe through the network centered on Father Mersenne.[^81]

Fermat's personality reflected his dual nature as both a respected magistrate and a passionate amateur mathematician. He was methodical and rigorous in his legal work, rising to the highest ranks of the criminal court, while maintaining an almost playful quality in his mathematical explorations, often posing challenging problems to other mathematicians without revealing his own solutions.[^82] This balance of professional gravitas and intellectual curiosity defined his character and contributed to his unique place in mathematical history.

## Legacy

Pierre de Fermat's legacy in mathematics is extraordinary, particularly given that he pursued the discipline only as a hobby. He is often called the founder of modern number theory, having effectively invented the field virtually single-handedly despite being a small-town amateur mathematician.[^83][^84] At his death, few could have been aware that one of the world's truly seminal minds was passing away, yet his influence would extend across centuries and shape multiple branches of mathematics.[^85]

### Impact on Number Theory

Fermat's contributions to number theory remain foundational to the discipline. His Little Theorem is essential in number theory and cryptography, with public-key encryption systems that secure digital communication relying heavily on prime numbers and modular arithmetic.[^86] The theorem is often used in testing large prime numbers and is the basis of codes that protect credit card transactions on the Internet today.[^87] The challenges Fermat posed, such as his Last Theorem, inspired centuries of mathematical exploration, and his ability to ask profound questions shaped the trajectory of mathematics as a discipline.[^88]

The proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Andrew Wiles in 1994 not only solved a 358-year-old puzzle but also proved much of the modularity theorem (formerly the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture) and opened up entire new approaches to numerous other problems.[^89] The mathematically powerful modularity lifting techniques developed in Wiles's proof have been cited as beginning "a new era in number theory" and are central to important pieces of modern mathematics, including widely used encryption techniques and the extensive research effort known as the Langlands Program.[^90]

### Influence on Calculus

Although Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz are credited with the invention of calculus, Fermat's work significantly influenced its development.[^91] His methods for finding tangents to curves and their maximum and minimum points led him to be regarded as an inventor of differential calculus, with his techniques serving as precursors to modern concepts of derivatives and integrals.[^92] Newton himself acknowledged that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from "Fermat's way of drawing tangents," and Fermat's views were fully justified some 30 years later in Newton's calculus.[^93][^94]

### Contributions to Other Fields

Fermat's Principle of Least Time remains fundamental in optics and mechanics, influencing the development of theories about light and wave propagation.[^95] His work in analytic geometry, developed independently of Descartes, laid the foundation for modern multidimensional geometry.[^96] The probability theory he developed with Blaise Pascal continues to underpin modern statistics and data science, with applications ranging from actuarial science to machine learning.[^97]

### Recognition and Honors

While Fermat himself never sought recognition during his lifetime, subsequent centuries have honored his memory extensively. Andrew Wiles received the 2016 Abel Prize and was knighted for proving Fermat's Last Theorem, bringing renewed attention to Fermat's original genius.[^98] Numerous mathematical concepts bear Fermat's name: Fermat numbers, Fermat primes, Fermat's Little Theorem, Fermat's principle, the Fermat point, Fermat's spiral, and many others, ensuring that his name remains ubiquitous in mathematical discourse.[^99]

### The Amateur Who Changed Mathematics

Perhaps Fermat's most inspiring legacy is his demonstration that one can make groundbreaking contributions to a field while maintaining it as a passionate hobby alongside a demanding professional career.[^100] His story challenges the assumption that world-class mathematical research requires academic appointments or institutional support. As a trained lawyer making mathematics more of a hobby than a profession, he represents a unique figure in mathematical history who achieved what many professional mathematicians of his time could not.[^101]

Today, Fermat is recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, standing alongside Descartes, Newton, Leibniz, and Euler in the pantheon of mathematical giants who shaped the development of modern mathematics.[^102] His ability to ask the right questions, develop powerful new methods, and inspire subsequent generations of mathematicians ensures that his legacy continues to grow even as we approach the 400th anniversary of his birth.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Pierre de Fermat's contributions have earned him extraordinary praise from the mathematical community across the centuries. Together with René Descartes, he is recognized as one of the two leading mathematicians of the first half of the 17th century, a remarkable achievement for someone who pursued mathematics only as a hobby.[^103] Peter L. Bernstein, in his 1996 book *Against the Gods*, described Fermat as "a mathematician of rare power," highlighting the exceptional quality of his work despite his amateur status.[^104]

Modern historians emphasize that despite his professional life as a jurist, Fermat's mathematical discoveries were so groundbreaking that they earned him a reputation as one of the greatest mathematical minds of all time.[^105] His work in number theory was of such exceptional quality and erudition that he is generally regarded as the founder of modern number theory, having effectively invented the field single-handedly.[^106] The fact that he accomplished this while working in isolation, without academic colleagues or institutional support, makes his achievements even more remarkable.

Isaac Newton's acknowledgment that his own early ideas about calculus came directly from "Fermat's way of drawing tangents" represents one of the highest compliments one mathematical genius can pay another.[^107] Similarly, the fact that so many of Fermat's discoveries were pivotal, providing necessary impetus to the opening of several new and rich fields of inquiry, demonstrates his profound influence on the development of mathematics.[^108] While it is true that others paralleled some of his work, in most cases Fermat provided the catalyst that opened these fields to systematic investigation.

Andrew Wiles's successful proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in 1994, described by scholars as "one of the highest achievements of number theory" and "the proof of the century," brought renewed appreciation for Fermat's genius.[^109] The proof not only validated Fermat's conjecture but also demonstrated the profound depth of the question he had posed—a question that required sophisticated 20th-century mathematical machinery to answer and that inspired 358 years of mathematical development.[^110]

Fermat's legacy extends beyond specific theorems to include his methodological innovations. His popularization of proof by infinite descent became one of the most powerful techniques in number theory, used extensively in all proofs for specific exponents of Fermat's Last Theorem.[^111] His principle of least time in optics set the precedent for variational principles throughout physics, influencing the development of classical mechanics and quantum theory.[^112] These fundamental contributions demonstrate that Fermat's influence extends far beyond the boundaries of pure mathematics into the physical sciences as well.

### Negative Views

Despite his undeniable genius, Fermat has faced significant criticism from mathematicians and historians, primarily concerning his reluctance to publish and his tendency to announce results without providing proofs. Many mathematicians, including the legendary Carl Friedrich Gauss, doubted several of Fermat's claims, especially given the difficulty of some problems and the limited mathematical methods available in the 17th century.[^113] The skepticism was not unfounded—Fermat's proofs were often incomplete or non-existent, leaving others to verify or expand upon his ideas, a practice that frustrated both his contemporaries and subsequent generations of mathematicians.[^114]

Fermat's deliberate avoidance of publication has been a source of ongoing criticism. Except for a few isolated papers, he published nothing in his lifetime and gave no systematic exposition of his methods.[^115] While this reluctance stemmed from his preference for the pleasure of discovery over reputation, it had significant negative consequences for the development of mathematics. Many of his discoveries were paralleled by other workers, and without his systematic publication, it would be easy to dismiss him as interesting but not particularly significant.[^116] The lack of documentation also meant that some of his methods had to be independently rediscovered by later mathematicians, delaying progress in certain fields.

The most famous criticism concerns Fermat's Last Theorem itself. The overwhelming consensus among modern mathematicians is that Fermat almost certainly did not have a valid proof of his Last Theorem, despite his famous marginal note claiming a "truly remarkable proof."[^117] The techniques required for Wiles's proof—including elliptic curves, modular forms, and Galois representations—were completely unavailable in the 17th century, making it virtually impossible that Fermat could have proven the theorem as he claimed.[^118] This has led scholars to conclude that Fermat either made an error in his reasoning or was exaggerating, a conclusion that somewhat tarnishes his reputation for mathematical rigor.

Critics also point to Fermat's contentious relationships with other mathematicians, particularly René Descartes. The acrimonious dispute between Fermat and Descartes in 1638, while eventually resolved, demonstrated a certain stubbornness and competitiveness that prevented productive collaboration between the two greatest mathematical minds of their era.[^119] Descartes's attempts to diminish Fermat's reputation, while unfair, were partly provoked by Fermat's aggressive criticism of Descartes's work on refraction.[^120]

Furthermore, Fermat's refusal to accept fractional solutions in his 1657 challenge problems, which broke with the classical tradition of Diophantus, created unnecessary disputes with other mathematicians like Wallis and Frénicle.[^121] This rigidity in defining the scope of problems, combined with his secretive approach to mathematics, contributed to misunderstandings and priority disputes that characterized much of 17th-century mathematical discourse.

Some historians argue that while Fermat asked profound questions and developed powerful methods, his failure to systematically develop and publish these methods meant that his actual impact on the immediate development of mathematics was less than it could have been. Had he published his work more systematically, the development of number theory, calculus, and analytic geometry might have proceeded more rapidly and coherently.[^122] Instead, much of his influence came posthumously, through the efforts of his son in publishing his correspondence and marginal notes, and through the centuries-long quest to prove the theorems he had announced without proof.
