## Summary

Imam al-Nasa'i was an Islamic scholar who compiled al-Sunan al-Sughra (also known as Sunan al-Nasa'i), one of the six canonical hadith collections in Sunni Islam. His collection is known for its strict criteria of authentication, considered by some scholars to be second only to Sahih al-Bukhari in rigor. He also wrote al-Sunan al-Kubra, a larger collection. He was reportedly killed for his support of Ali ibn Abi Talib's superiority.
