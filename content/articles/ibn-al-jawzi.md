## Summary

Ibn al-Jawzi was one of the most prolific scholars and popular preachers in medieval Baghdad. He wrote over 700 works covering Quran commentary, hadith, history, biography, jurisprudence, and devotional literature. His sermons at the Mosque of al-Mansur drew enormous crowds. His Talbis Iblis (The Devil's Deception) criticized religious innovations, and his biographical dictionary Sifat al-Safwa profiled pious Muslims. He represents the Hanbali scholarly tradition at its finest.
