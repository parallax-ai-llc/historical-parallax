## Summary

Louis de Broglie was a French physicist who proposed the wave nature of electrons, a fundamental concept of quantum mechanics. His 1924 doctoral thesis hypothesized that all matter exhibits wave-like behavior, now called the de Broglie wavelength. This wave-particle duality was confirmed experimentally and earned him the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physics. His work was instrumental in the development of quantum mechanics.
