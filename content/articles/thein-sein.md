## Summary

Thein Sein served as the eighth President of Myanmar from 2011 to 2016, overseeing the country's transition from military rule to a quasi-democratic system. A former army general who previously served as Prime Minister from 2007 to 2010, he is widely regarded as a reformist leader who initiated dramatic political and economic liberalization after nearly half a century of military dictatorship.[^1] His presidency was marked by significant democratic reforms, including the release of political prisoners, media liberalization, and engagement with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, though his legacy remains controversial due to his failure to address ethnic conflicts, particularly the Rohingya crisis, and his inability to establish genuine civilian control over the military.[^2] Despite his reform credentials, Thein Sein's administration ultimately cemented the military's continued power in Myanmar's political system.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Thein Sein was born on April 20, 1945, in Kyonku, a small village in the Irrawaddy River delta region, approximately 25 miles south of Pathein in southern Myanmar.[^4] He was the youngest of three children born to Maung Phyo and Khin Nyunt, landless farmers who struggled with poverty throughout Thein Sein's childhood.[^5] His father made a modest living carrying cargo at the river jetty and weaving bamboo mats to support the family.[^6] Few details are known about Thein Sein's early life, as he has maintained a relatively low profile and modest demeanor throughout his career, rarely discussing his humble origins in public forums.[^7]

Growing up in the rural Irrawaddy delta, one of Myanmar's poorest regions, Thein Sein experienced firsthand the economic hardships that plagued much of the country during the post-colonial period. This background would later inform his approach to governance, particularly his emphasis on rural development and his reputation for personal modesty and lack of ostentation.[^8] Unlike many military and political elites in Myanmar, Thein Sein's family did not benefit from wealth or connections, making his rise through the military ranks all the more remarkable.

Thein Sein's path out of poverty came through military service. He attended the Defence Services Academy (DSA), Myanmar's premier military training institution, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree.[^9] He graduated from the 9th intake of the DSA in 1968 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Myanmar Army.[^10] This marked the beginning of a four-decade military career that would eventually lead him to the highest office in the land. Throughout his military service, Thein Sein was known more as a bureaucrat than as a combat soldier, preferring administrative and organizational roles to frontline command positions.[^11]

---

## Rise to Power

After graduating from the Defence Services Academy in 1968, Thein Sein began a steady climb through the ranks of the Myanmar military, known as the Tatmadaw. In 1988, during a period of significant political turmoil in Myanmar, he served as a major in the 55th Light Infantry Division in Sagaing Division.[^12] He later commanded the 89th Infantry Battalion in Kalay Township, also in Sagaing Division.[^13] These early postings gave him experience in managing military operations in ethnically diverse regions, though he was never known as a combat commander.

By 1991, Thein Sein had returned to Yangon after being promoted to the rank of colonel and appointed as 1st Grade General Staff Officer in the War Office.[^14] This administrative position marked a turning point in his career, as he transitioned from field operations to the bureaucratic heart of the military establishment. He was subsequently promoted to brigadier general, but remained at his position in the War Office, marking the first time a brigadier general had been appointed to the position of General Staff Officer.[^15] This unusual appointment signaled the high regard in which senior military leaders held him.

Three years later, in 1996, Thein Sein was appointed to lead the newly established Triangle Regional Military Command in Kyaingtong, Shan State, a strategically important position along Myanmar's border with Thailand and Laos.[^16] He served in this role for three years, from 1998 to 2001, gaining experience in managing complex border security and ethnic minority issues. In 1998, he became a member of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), the ruling military junta that governed Myanmar following the 1988 uprising.[^17]

Thein Sein's rise accelerated in 2001 when he was appointed Secretary-2 of the SPDC, positioning him among the regime's inner circle.[^18] When General Khin Nyunt was deposed and General Soe Win became Prime Minister in 2004, Thein Sein was promoted to Secretary-1 and elevated to the rank of full General in late 2004.[^19] These promotions reflected his growing influence and the trust placed in him by Senior General Than Shwe, Myanmar's supreme military leader. Known for his loyalty, discipline, and low-profile nature, Thein Sein was viewed as a reliable figure by Than Shwe, and this loyalty was considered key to his rise through the military and political ranks.[^20]

In April 2007, Thein Sein was appointed interim Prime Minister, replacing General Soe Win, who was undergoing medical treatment for leukemia.[^21] He was formally appointed as Soe Win's permanent successor on October 24, 2007, following Soe Win's death on October 12, 2007.[^22] As Prime Minister, Thein Sein maintained the junta's authoritarian policies while quietly building relationships that would later facilitate his reform agenda.

The pivotal moment in Thein Sein's career came on April 29, 2010, when he retired from the military along with 22 other senior military officials to lead the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) as a civilian.[^23] This transition was part of the junta's carefully orchestrated plan to create a quasi-civilian government that would maintain military control while presenting a more democratic facade to the international community. Following the controversial 2010 elections, which were widely criticized as neither free nor fair, Thein Sein was elected President of Myanmar by the newly convened parliament on February 4, 2011.[^24] He was inaugurated on March 30, 2011, marking the beginning of what many would call Myanmar's "political spring."[^25]

## Major Achievements

Thein Sein's presidency from 2011 to 2016 is widely regarded as a transformative period in Myanmar's modern history, marked by dramatic political, economic, and social reforms that opened the country to the world after nearly half a century of isolation and military rule.[^26] His inaugural address on March 30, 2011, set the tone for his administration, outlining an ambitious agenda that included market economy reforms, judicial reform, human rights improvements, and environmental conservation.[^27]

### Political Reforms and Democratization

One of Thein Sein's most significant achievements was the release of political prisoners and the legalization of opposition political parties. Two general amnesties in 2011 released between 10,000 and 40,000 prisoners, with approximately 300 considered political prisoners.[^28] Most notably, Thein Sein proved willing to work with Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), who had spent years under house arrest.[^29] The government lifted the ban on the NLD, allowing the party to register for national elections, a remarkable reversal from the junta's previous hard-line stance.[^30]

In the parliamentary by-elections of April 2012, the NLD won 43 of the available 45 seats, with Aung San Suu Kyi herself winning election to the House of Representatives.[^31] This peaceful transfer of some political power to the opposition demonstrated Thein Sein's commitment to democratic reform. The culmination of his democratic transition came in November 2015, when Myanmar held its first fairly contested parliamentary elections in decades, resulting in an overwhelming victory for the NLD.[^32] Thein Sein remained in office until late March 2016, peacefully transferring power to Htin Kyaw, Myanmar's first civilian president in more than 50 years.[^33]

### Media Freedom and Civil Liberties

Thein Sein's government undertook significant deregulation of Myanmar's heavily censored media. In September 2011, several previously banned websites, including YouTube, Democratic Voice of Burma, and Voice of America, were unblocked.[^34] The government eased press censorship, allowing for greater freedom of expression and the emergence of independent media outlets.[^35] This opening of the information space was crucial in allowing civil society to develop and enabling Myanmar citizens to engage with the outside world after decades of isolation.

Freedom of speech was restored to an extent unimaginable under previous military rule, and the ban on social media platforms was revoked, leading both the opposition and the general public to accept Thein Sein as a reformer genuinely open to democratic changes.[^36] These reforms, while incomplete, represented a significant departure from the paranoid authoritarianism that had characterized Myanmar's governance since the 1962 military coup.

### Economic Reforms and International Reengagement

On the economic front, Thein Sein initiated notable reforms after becoming president in March 2011, including new policies on anti-corruption, currency exchange rates, foreign investment laws, and taxation.[^37] In April 2012, Myanmar's multiple exchange rates were abolished and the Central Bank of Myanmar established a managed float of the Burmese kyat, bringing greater transparency and stability to the currency.[^38] In November 2012, President Thein Sein signed a new Foreign Investment Law designed to attract international capital.[^39]

In October 2011, eleven private banks were allowed to trade foreign currency, marking a significant liberalization of Myanmar's financial sector.[^40] These reforms, combined with the establishment of labor unions and workers' organizations, helped stimulate economic growth.[^41] Myanmar's GDP growth accelerated to an estimated 6.3 percent in fiscal year 2012, compared with an average of 5 percent in the previous five years.[^42]

Perhaps most importantly, Thein Sein successfully reengaged with international financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which brought access to aid and loans and facilitated the slashing of Myanmar's massive foreign debts.[^43] His readiness to transform relations with the United States set an important new direction for Myanmar's foreign policy.[^44] International sanctions that had dominated discussions about Myanmar for more than twenty years quickly ceased to be an issue, with most Western sanctions lifted or suspended in recognition of the reform progress.[^45]

President Barack Obama's historic visit to Myanmar in November 2012 consolidated a major shift in US-Myanmar relations and symbolized the country's return to the international community.[^46] The Myanmar government under Thein Sein pursued a non-aligned foreign policy both in declaratory and practical terms, seeking to balance relationships with China, the United States, India, and ASEAN countries.[^47]

### Peace Process and Ethnic Reconciliation Efforts

One of Thein Sein's most important initiatives was his clear political commitment to achieving a nationwide peace agreement with Myanmar's numerous ethnic armed organizations.[^48] In August 2011, he began the "Call for Peace," inviting the armed ethnic minorities of Myanmar to begin peace talks with the government.[^49] In his inaugural speech on March 30, 2011, he stated his intention to build national unity by addressing the decades of armed conflict with the ethnic nationalities.[^50]

At the end of 2011, the military was ordered by the government to stop fighting the Kachin rebels, and in early 2012, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the two parties.[^51] By early 2013, numerous bilateral ceasefire agreements had been signed by the main ethnic armed groups and the government, and in late 2013, the Nationwide Ceasefire Coordination Team was formed.[^52]

The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was signed in October 2015 by leaders of eight armed groups and three representatives of the Union government: President Thein Sein, Speaker of Parliament Shwe Mann, and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces Senior General Min Aung Hlaing.[^53] While the Thein Sein government was only able to persuade about half of the ethnic armed groups to sign the ceasefire before handing over power, the NCA represented the most comprehensive peace initiative in Myanmar's post-independence history.[^54]

### Suspension of the Myitsone Dam Project

Perhaps Thein Sein's most politically significant decision was his suspension in September 2011 of the Chinese-backed Myitsone Dam project, a $3.6 billion hydroelectric project on the Irrawaddy River.[^55] This decision powerfully demonstrated government concern for ordinary people and environmental issues, as the dam had been deeply unpopular with the Burmese public due to its potential environmental and cultural impact.[^56] The suspension also changed Myanmar's relations with China, demonstrating that the new government was willing to assert Myanmar's interests even against its most powerful neighbor and patron.[^57] This move bolstered Thein Sein's credibility as a leader responsive to public opinion and willing to challenge the status quo.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his reputation as a reformer, Thein Sein's presidency was marked by significant controversies and failures, particularly regarding ethnic minorities, human rights, the rule of law, and the limits of democratic reform. His inability or unwillingness to address these fundamental issues has tarnished his legacy and raised questions about the depth and sincerity of his reform agenda.

### The Rohingya Crisis and Anti-Muslim Policies

The most damning criticism of Thein Sein's presidency concerns his administration's treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority in Rakhine State. Following communal violence between Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists in June 2012, which left dozens dead and tens of thousands displaced, President Thein Sein proposed a deeply controversial solution.[^58] According to the presidential office's statement, Thein Sein told UN official António Guterres: "Burma will take responsibility for its ethnic nationalities but it is not at all possible to recognise the illegal border-crossing Rohingyas who are not an ethnic [group] in Burma."[^59]

Thein Sein further stated that the government was prepared to hand over the Rohingyas to the UNHCR and then resettle the ethnic group in any third country "that are willing to take them."[^60] The UNHCR swiftly rejected this proposal, and the international community condemned Thein Sein's suggestion as effectively advocating ethnic cleansing.[^61] On July 12, 2012, a month after the violence, President Thein Sein called for "illegal" Rohingya to be sent to "third countries."[^62] Since most Rohingya, even those whose families had resided in Myanmar for generations, lacked formal legal status due to discriminatory citizenship laws, the president's language implied that the great majority of Myanmar's Rohingya population did not belong in the country.[^63]

In the months following the violence, the Burmese government took no serious steps to hold accountable those responsible for attacks on Rohingya communities or to prevent future outbreaks of violence.[^64] Human Rights Watch documented systematic crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims during Thein Sein's presidency, including arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, rape and sexual violence, restrictions on movement, and denial of citizenship rights.[^65]

Under pressure from Buddhist nationalist groups protesting the Rohingya's right to vote in a 2015 constitutional referendum, President Thein Sein canceled the temporary identity cards (known as "white cards") in February 2015, effectively revoking the Rohingya's newly gained right to vote.[^66] This capitulation to extremist pressure demonstrated the limits of Thein Sein's commitment to inclusive democracy and human rights.

### Support for Buddhist Nationalism

President Thein Sein's relationship with extremist Buddhist nationalist movements further undermines his reformist credentials. The 969 Movement, a Buddhist nationalist organization that promoted boycotts of Muslim businesses and "Marry Buddhist" campaigns, gained prominence during his presidency.[^67] This movement largely morphed into Ma Ba Tha (the Organization for Protecting Race/Nation, Religion, and the Buddha's Dispensation) in June 2013, which served as a political lobby group that persuaded Thein Sein's government to adopt four controversial laws protecting "race/nation and religion."[^68]

These laws, passed between 2014 and 2015, included the Population Control Health Care Law, which was widely criticized as a direct attack on perceived high birth rates among Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims, and laws making it more difficult for Muslims to marry Buddhist women.[^69] President U Thein Sein's decision to enact these discriminatory laws boosted his reputation among Buddhist nationalists as a defender of race and religion.[^70]

When prominent Buddhist nationalist monk Ashin Wirathu was identified by Time magazine as the face of Buddhist extremism, President Thein Sein defended Wirathu, saying the monk's order was striving for peace and prosperity.[^71] He added that "The government is currently striving with religious leaders, political parties, media and the people to rid Myanmar [Burma] of unwanted conflicts," a statement that many interpreted as endorsing or at least tolerating Buddhist nationalist rhetoric.[^72] These actions suggest that Thein Sein either shared the Buddhist nationalist ideology or cynically exploited it for political gain, neither of which reflects well on his legacy.

### Failure to Establish Rule of Law

Thein Sein's failure to make significant progress on reinstating the rule of law in Myanmar was a considerable disappointment to reformers and international observers.[^73] Serious human rights abuses continued throughout his presidency, especially at the hands of the army, which operated with near-total impunity.[^74] The judicial system remained highly corrupt, and land rights for ordinary people were not assured, leading to widespread land grabs and forced displacement.[^75]

Thein Sein was unable to assert his authority over the Myanmar Army, which essentially did not comply with his directions to cease fighting Kachin insurgents in northern Myanmar, demonstrating the limits of his power and the continuing dominance of military interests.[^76] The Thein Sein administration, while generally associated with reform and democratization, also cemented the Tatmadaw's power into the nation's "democratic" future under the guise of liberalization.[^77] The 2008 Constitution, which remained in force throughout his presidency, guaranteed the military 25 percent of parliamentary seats, control over key ministries, and the ability to veto constitutional amendments.[^78]

### Corruption and Governance Challenges

While Thein Sein himself was widely viewed as personally honest and free of corruption, his administration struggled to address Myanmar's endemic corruption problem.[^79] President Thein Sein admitted that corruption and bribery were still "chronic" in the country and must be addressed by a change in attitude among government officials.[^80] In a speech in late December 2012, he voiced rare public criticism of the bureaucracy, saying rampant corruption, bribery, and inefficiency were getting in the way of the reform process and that Myanmar still fell short of international norms in good governance.[^81]

In early January 2013, Thein Sein formed a high-level anti-corruption team to pursue his stated goal of clean government.[^82] In February 2013, President U Thein Sein formed the 15-member Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), though the inclusion of the President and Speakers as members led to widespread fears that without non-government representation, the commission would be largely ineffective.[^83] Critics noted that there was no transparent fiscal administrative mechanism or public financial management system in place.[^84] Myanmar's ranking in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index improved only marginally during his presidency, from 172 out of 176 countries in 2012 to 157 out of 177 countries.[^85]

### Economic Reform Limitations

While Thein Sein's economic reforms garnered international praise, some analysts have argued that the myth of Thein Sein's economic legacy overstates the actual achievements.[^86] Economic growth remained uneven, with benefits accruing primarily to military-connected cronies and urban elites rather than the rural poor who constituted the majority of Myanmar's population. The liberalization enabled not only civil society growth but also the expansion of "uncivil society," including criminal networks and exploitative business practices.[^87] The partial liberalization was orchestrated by the military to safeguard its own power and economic interests, ensuring that the Tatmadaw retained control over key sectors of the economy.[^88]

## Personal Life

Thein Sein's personal life has been characterized by modesty and a low public profile, particularly when compared to other military and political leaders in Myanmar. Born into poverty as the youngest of three children, he maintained his humble demeanor throughout his rise to power.[^89] His parents' struggles as landless farmers in the Irrawaddy Delta left a lasting impression on him, and he was known throughout his career for lacking the ostentation and displays of wealth common among Myanmar's military elite.[^90]

Thein Sein is married, and he has daughters, though detailed information about his wife and children has been kept private.[^91] His family was notably restrained compared to the families of other Myanmar leaders. His wife and daughters avoided the ostentatious shows of wealth that earned his predecessor's family, particularly General Than Shwe's relatives, so much animosity among the Myanmar public.[^92] This modest lifestyle contributed to Thein Sein's reputation as being free of corruption and helped him maintain legitimacy during his presidency.[^93]

Colleagues and observers have consistently described Thein Sein as honest, not personally ambitious, disciplined, and loyal—traits that proved crucial in generating badly needed legitimacy for his government after decades of military rule.[^94] His low-profile nature and bureaucratic approach meant he was never a charismatic leader, but rather a methodical administrator who preferred working behind the scenes to making grand public gestures.[^95]

Thein Sein is a devout Buddhist, and his faith has played an important role in his life and political career. Shortly after leaving office on March 30, 2016, he temporarily ordained as a monk on April 1, 2016, under Ashin Nandamalabhivamsa in a monastery in Pyin Oo Lwin, taking the monastic name U Santidhamma.[^96] This temporary ordination is a common tradition for Buddhist men in Myanmar, particularly during significant life transitions, and reflects the deep integration of Buddhist practice into Myanmar's cultural and political life.[^97]

Since retirement, Thein Sein has largely distanced himself from his former colleagues and underlings, opting to enjoy his retirement at his mansion in Naypyitaw, Myanmar's capital.[^98] He lives in the "Row of Six" neighborhood in Pobbathiri Township, alongside other ex-generals, including former dictator Than Shwe.[^99] Thein Sein has maintained a low profile and silence following the February 2021 military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.[^100]

However, he has made occasional public appearances. On Armed Forces Day in March 2023, Thein Sein was among two dignitaries who gave "words of advice" to a select audience including coup leader Min Aung Hlaing and his wife.[^101] In 2024, Thein Sein made his first foreign trip since the 2021 military coup, traveling to Beijing to attend an event commemorating the 70th anniversary of the Declaration of Five Principles of Peaceful Co-Existence.[^102] These appearances suggest that while he has remained largely out of politics, he maintains some relationship with Myanmar's current military leadership.

## Legacy

Thein Sein's legacy remains deeply contested, with assessments ranging from praise for his role in Myanmar's democratic transition to criticism of his failure to address fundamental issues of human rights, military power, and ethnic conflict. His presidency represented a pivotal moment in Myanmar's modern history, but the ultimate trajectory of that transition—culminating in the February 2021 military coup—has raised profound questions about whether his reforms were genuine steps toward democracy or merely a recalibration of military rule.

### The Democratic Transition

Since taking office in March 2011, Thein Sein oversaw a series of dramatic changes in Myanmar, a country that had been under military rule for nearly half a century.[^103] He became the first democratically elected president of Myanmar, though the 2010 elections that brought him to power were widely criticized as flawed.[^104] The "Myanmar Spring," which commenced on March 30, 2011, with President Thein Sein's inaugural address, marked the first speech of the first competitively elected head of state since the 1962 military coup.[^105]

Thein Sein steered the country through a transition that peaked with Myanmar's first free election in decades in November 2015, peacefully transferring power to the NLD-led government in March 2016.[^106] This peaceful transfer of power was unprecedented in Myanmar's modern history and earned Thein Sein international praise. His willingness to work with Aung San Suu Kyi and the opposition represented a dramatic departure from the paranoid authoritarianism of previous military regimes.[^107]

History should judge Thein Sein positively, although he is still criticized for not engaging in more thoroughgoing reforms, according to some observers.[^108] His performance as president probably exceeded most expectations, particularly given that he came from within the military establishment and might have been expected to defend its interests more vigorously.[^109] By reputation, he is honest, not corrupt, and not personally ambitious—traits that were important in generating badly needed legitimacy for his government.[^110]

### Limitations and the Military's Continuing Power

However, Thein Sein's legacy is significantly undermined by his administration's cementing of military power into Myanmar's ostensibly democratic system. Thein Sein and fellow reformers reassured the military about its continuing independence and power, in keeping with the 2008 Myanmar Constitution's emphasis on the centrality of the armed forces.[^111] The constitution, drafted by the military junta before Thein Sein took office, guaranteed the Tatmadaw 25 percent of parliamentary seats, control over three key ministries (Defense, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs), and effective veto power over constitutional amendments.[^112]

This constitutional framework meant that Myanmar's transition was always a "disciplined democracy" in which the military retained ultimate power. The partial liberalization was orchestrated by the military to safeguard its own power, and reforms not only benefited civil society but also enabled the growth of uncivil society.[^113] The February 2021 military coup, which overthrew the NLD government elected in 2015, demonstrated that the government had failed to exercise civilian control over the junta and that Thein Sein's assurances of irreversible democratic transition were unfounded.[^114]

Scholars are divided into two camps regarding Myanmar's transformation under Thein Sein. The "optimist" camp sees the transformation since 2011 as caused by changes at the apex of the military regime, providing a rare opportunity for democratic reforms, with the retirement of Senior General Than Shwe in March 2011 and the rise of Thein Sein and other reformist actors within the military regime providing room for a more constructive role of civil society and international actors.[^115] Scholars in the second camp see Myanmar's reform era in a much more negative light, viewing it as a facade that allowed the military to maintain control while presenting a more acceptable face to the international community.[^116]

### Ethnic Conflicts and Human Rights

Thein Sein's most significant failure concerns his administration's handling of ethnic conflicts and human rights, particularly the Rohingya crisis. The continued persecution of the Rohingyas at the hands of the majority Bamar community and the denial of citizenship had a deep impact on Myanmar's foreign relations and humanitarian situation.[^117] Thein Sein's proposal to deport Rohingyas and his support for discriminatory laws represent a dark stain on his legacy that cannot be erased by his other achievements.[^118]

His inability to complete the peace process with ethnic armed organizations, despite the signing of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement, left Myanmar with continuing armed conflicts that have persisted and even intensified since his presidency.[^119] Thein Sein noted that everyone must be tolerant as ethnic conflicts were rooted over five decades and could not be solved quickly, but critics argue that his administration did not make sufficient efforts to address the structural issues underlying these conflicts.[^120]

### International Relations and Economic Opening

On foreign policy and economic matters, Thein Sein's legacy is more positive. His readiness to transform relations with the United States set an important new direction for Myanmar foreign policy that is unlikely to change or erode in the foreseeable future.[^121] The lifting of international sanctions that had dominated discussions about Myanmar for more than twenty years was among Thein Sein's significant achievements.[^122] His successful reengagement with international financial institutions brought access to aid and loans and helped integrate Myanmar into the global economy.[^123]

The Myanmar government under Thein Sein pursued a non-aligned foreign policy that sought to balance relationships with major powers, reducing Myanmar's dependence on China while developing ties with the United States, India, Japan, and ASEAN countries.[^124] This diversification of Myanmar's foreign relations was a strategic achievement that gave the country greater diplomatic flexibility.

### Final Assessment

Thein Sein left behind a host of problems for the next administration when he stepped down in March 2016.[^125] His most important legacy may be his clear political commitment to a nationwide peace agreement and his willingness to open Myanmar's political system, although completing these processes proved frustrating and complex.[^126] Ultimately, Thein Sein's presidency represented a genuine but incomplete reform effort that opened space for democratic participation while failing to dismantle the fundamental structures of military power that continue to dominate Myanmar's politics.

The February 2021 coup demonstrated the fragility of Myanmar's democratic transition and raised troubling questions about whether Thein Sein's reforms were ever intended to lead to genuine civilian rule or merely to create a more internationally acceptable form of military dominance. Nevertheless, his willingness to engage with the opposition, release political prisoners, and allow free elections—even knowing his party would likely lose—suggests a degree of genuine commitment to democratic principles that was rare among Myanmar's military leadership.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic and policy analysts who view Thein Sein's presidency positively emphasize his role in initiating Myanmar's democratic opening after nearly half a century of military rule. These observers argue that Thein Sein's performance as president probably exceeded most expectations, particularly given his background as a career military officer who might have been expected to resist democratic reforms.[^127] His personal qualities—honesty, lack of corruption, discipline, and absence of personal ambition—generated badly needed legitimacy for Myanmar's transitional government during a critical period.[^128]

Supporters point to Thein Sein's concrete achievements: the release of thousands of political prisoners, the legalization of opposition parties, the holding of credible by-elections in 2012 and general elections in 2015, the easing of media censorship, and the peaceful transfer of power to the NLD-led government in 2016.[^129] These accomplishments represented a dramatic departure from the paranoid authoritarianism that had characterized Myanmar's governance since 1962 and created space for civil society development and political participation.[^130]

Thein Sein's decision to suspend the Myitsone Dam project is often cited as evidence of his responsiveness to public opinion and his willingness to prioritize Myanmar's interests over Chinese pressure.[^131] His commitment to the peace process with ethnic armed organizations, while incomplete, demonstrated a genuine effort to address conflicts that had plagued Myanmar since independence.[^132] The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement signed in October 2015, though only including eight ethnic armed groups, represented the most comprehensive peace initiative in Myanmar's modern history.[^133]

On foreign policy, defenders of Thein Sein's legacy emphasize his successful reengagement with the international community and the diversification of Myanmar's foreign relations away from overwhelming dependence on China.[^134] His transformation of relations with the United States and the lifting of international sanctions opened Myanmar to foreign investment, aid, and diplomatic engagement that had been denied for decades.[^135] This opening accelerated Myanmar's economic growth and provided opportunities for its people that had been unimaginable under previous military rule.[^136]

Some scholars in the "optimist" camp see Myanmar's transformation since 2011 as caused by changes at the apex of the military regime, with the retirement of Senior General Than Shwe and the rise of Thein Sein and other reformist actors within the military providing a rare opportunity for democratic reforms.[^137] From this perspective, Thein Sein deserves credit for seizing this opportunity and pushing reforms further than many expected, even if those reforms ultimately proved insufficient to establish genuine civilian rule.[^138]

History should judge Thein Sein positively, some analysts argue, acknowledging that while he is still criticized for not engaging in more thoroughgoing reforms, his efforts represented a genuine attempt to transform Myanmar's political system within the constraints imposed by the military establishment.[^139] His most important achievement may have been his clear political commitment to a nationwide peace agreement and democratic transition, even if completing these processes proved frustrating and complex.[^140]

### Negative Views

Critics of Thein Sein's presidency, including many scholars, human rights advocates, and ethnic minority representatives, argue that his reforms were superficial and designed primarily to maintain military power while presenting a more acceptable face to the international community. Scholars in the second camp see Myanmar's reform era in a much more negative light, viewing the political opening as a cynical exercise in regime survival rather than genuine democratization.[^141]

The most damning criticism concerns Thein Sein's handling of the Rohingya crisis and his administration's support for discriminatory policies against Myanmar's Muslim minorities. His proposal to deport Rohingyas to third countries, his cancellation of their voting rights, and his government's enactment of discriminatory "race and religion protection laws" represent systematic persecution that some observers have characterized as laying the groundwork for genocide.[^142] Human Rights Watch documented crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing of Rohingya Muslims during Thein Sein's presidency, for which his administration took no meaningful accountability measures.[^143]

Critics also point to Thein Sein's relationship with extremist Buddhist nationalist movements, including his defense of anti-Muslim monk Ashin Wirathu and his government's accommodation of Ma Ba Tha's discriminatory legislative agenda.[^144] These actions suggest that Thein Sein either shared the Buddhist nationalist ideology or cynically exploited it for political gain, both of which fundamentally undermine his credentials as a reformer committed to inclusive democracy and human rights.[^145]

Thein Sein's failure to make significant progress on reinstating the rule of law represents another major criticism. Serious human rights abuses continued throughout his presidency, the judicial system remained highly corrupt, and the military operated with near-total impunity.[^146] His inability to assert civilian authority over the Tatmadaw, particularly evident in the military's refusal to cease fighting against Kachin insurgents despite presidential directives, demonstrated the fundamental limits of his power and the continuing dominance of military interests.[^147]

The Thein Sein administration, while generally associated with reform and democratization, actually cemented the Tatmadaw's power into the nation's "democratic" future under the guise of liberalization.[^148] The 2008 Constitution, which Thein Sein made no serious effort to amend despite its obvious anti-democratic provisions, guaranteed military control over key aspects of governance and gave the armed forces effective veto power over political change.[^149] Thein Sein and fellow reformers reassured the military about its continuing independence and power, ensuring that Myanmar's transition would never threaten the Tatmadaw's fundamental interests.[^150]

The February 2021 military coup provides the ultimate vindication of this critical perspective, demonstrating that the government had failed to exercise civilian control over the junta and that Thein Sein's assurances of irreversible democratic transition were either naive or deliberately misleading.[^151] The coup revealed that the military had never genuinely accepted civilian rule and was prepared to overthrow democratically elected governments whenever its interests were threatened.

Some critics argue that the "myth of Thein Sein's economic legacy" overstates the actual achievements of his presidency, noting that economic growth remained uneven and benefits accrued primarily to military-connected cronies rather than ordinary citizens.[^152] The partial liberalization enabled not only civil society growth but also the expansion of "uncivil society," including criminal networks and exploitative business practices.[^153] The absence of transparent fiscal administrative mechanisms and effective public financial management meant that corruption remained endemic throughout his presidency.[^154]

From this critical perspective, Thein Sein's presidency represented a tactical recalibration of military rule rather than a genuine democratic transition. The reforms provided sufficient political space to satisfy international demands and allow sanctions to be lifted, while preserving the military's fundamental control over Myanmar's political and economic systems. The peaceful transfer of power to the NLD in 2016, rather than demonstrating Thein Sein's commitment to democracy, merely reflected the military's confidence that the 2008 Constitution would prevent any genuine challenge to its power—a calculation that proved correct when the military launched its coup five years later.
