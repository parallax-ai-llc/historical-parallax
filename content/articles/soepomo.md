## Summary

Soepomo (also spelled Supomo) was one of Indonesia's most influential founding fathers and a leading legal scholar who played a crucial role in drafting the Indonesian constitution and establishing the philosophical foundations of the new nation. Born in 1903 in Sukoharjo, Central Java, he became known for his advocacy of the "integralist state" concept, which emphasized organic unity over individual rights and Western-style democracy. As Minister of Justice in the early independence period, he helped shape Indonesia's legal system, though his authoritarian tendencies and opposition to liberal democracy remain controversial. His intellectual legacy continues to influence Indonesian political thought, particularly debates about the balance between communal harmony and individual freedoms.

## Early Life and Background

Soepomo was born on January 22, 1903, in Sukoharjo, a small town in Central Java, into a priyayi (Javanese aristocratic) family that valued education and public service[^1]. His father was a civil servant in the Dutch colonial administration, providing the family with moderate economic stability and access to Western education. Growing up during the height of Dutch colonial rule, Soepomo witnessed firsthand the inequalities and tensions of the colonial system, experiences that would later shape his nationalist convictions[^2].

From an early age, Soepomo demonstrated exceptional intellectual abilities. He attended Dutch-language schools, which were generally reserved for the colonial elite and a small number of privileged indigenous children. His education exposed him to both Western legal traditions and Javanese cultural values, creating an intellectual foundation that would characterize his later work[^3]. After completing his secondary education, Soepomo enrolled at the Rechtshogeschool (Law School) in Batavia (now Jakarta), where he studied Dutch law and colonial administration.

In 1923, Soepomo received a scholarship to continue his legal studies in the Netherlands, a rare opportunity for an Indonesian at the time. He studied at Leiden University, one of Europe's most prestigious institutions for the study of colonial law and administration[^4]. During his time in Leiden, he was exposed to various European political philosophies, including German staatsrecht (constitutional law) theories that emphasized the organic unity of the state. He completed his doctoral dissertation in 1927 on the topic of customary law (adat law) in Indonesia, demonstrating his interest in synthesizing indigenous legal traditions with modern legal theory[^5].

Soepomo's experience in Europe was transformative, but rather than embracing Western individualism and liberal democracy, he became increasingly convinced that Indonesia needed a distinctive political system rooted in its own cultural traditions. He was particularly influenced by German legal theorists who emphasized the state as an organic whole rather than a contract between individuals, ideas that resonated with Javanese concepts of harmony and collective responsibility[^6]. Upon returning to the Dutch East Indies in 1927, he began his career as a legal scholar and colonial administrator, while quietly nurturing nationalist sympathies.

## Rise to Power

After returning from the Netherlands, Soepomo quickly established himself as one of the leading legal minds in the Dutch East Indies. He joined the colonial civil service and taught at the Rechtshogeschool in Batavia, where he became known for his expertise in adat law—the customary legal systems of various Indonesian ethnic groups[^7]. His scholarly work on adat law was groundbreaking, as it challenged the colonial administration's tendency to impose Dutch legal codes uniformly across the diverse archipelago. He argued that indigenous legal traditions should be respected and incorporated into the colonial legal system, a position that earned him respect among both Indonesian intellectuals and some progressive Dutch administrators[^8].

During the 1930s, Soepomo's reputation grew as he published extensively on legal theory, customary law, and constitutional issues. He became associated with the moderate wing of the Indonesian nationalist movement, which sought greater autonomy and recognition of Indonesian culture within the colonial framework rather than immediate independence through confrontation[^9]. His approach was intellectual and gradualist, contrasting with more radical nationalists like Sukarno who advocated revolutionary action.

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945) marked a turning point in Soepomo's political career. The Japanese, seeking to gain Indonesian support for their war effort, created opportunities for Indonesian intellectuals and nationalists to participate in limited self-governance. In 1943, the Japanese established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence (BPUPKI), and Soepomo was appointed as one of its key members[^10]. This committee was tasked with preparing the constitutional and philosophical foundations for an independent Indonesia, should Japan decide to grant independence.

Within BPUPKI, Soepomo emerged as one of the most influential voices. On May 31, 1945, he delivered a famous speech outlining his vision for the Indonesian state, advocating for what he called the "integralist state" (negara integralistik)[^11]. Drawing on German organicist theories, Japanese concepts of familial statehood, and Javanese notions of harmony, he argued that Indonesia should reject Western liberal democracy with its emphasis on individual rights and competing interest groups. Instead, he proposed a state where all elements—government, people, and territory—formed an organic unity, with decisions made through consensus (musyawarah) and mutual cooperation (gotong royong) rather than adversarial party politics[^12].

Soepomo's speech was met with both enthusiasm and criticism. While many appreciated his attempt to ground Indonesian political philosophy in indigenous values rather than simply importing Western models, others—particularly those influenced by Islamic political thought and Western democratic ideals—worried that his integralist state could easily become authoritarian[^13]. Muhammad Yamin and Muhammad Hatta, other prominent founding fathers, offered alternative visions that placed greater emphasis on democratic representation and individual rights.

Despite these debates, Soepomo's influence was substantial. When the committee drafted Indonesia's first constitution (which would become the 1945 Constitution), many of his ideas were incorporated, including the emphasis on gotong royong, the rejection of separation of powers in favor of a strong presidency, and the absence of a detailed bill of rights[^14]. After Indonesia declared independence on August 17, 1945, Soepomo was appointed as Minister of Justice in the first cabinet, a position that gave him significant influence over the development of Indonesia's legal system during the revolutionary period (1945-1949)[^15].

## Major Achievements

Soepomo's most enduring achievement was his role in drafting the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia, which remains the country's basic law to this day (though it has been amended multiple times). As one of the principal architects of this document, he helped create a constitutional framework that sought to balance indigenous Indonesian values with the requirements of modern statehood[^16]. The constitution's preamble, which includes the Pancasila (Five Principles) as the philosophical foundation of the state, reflects the kind of synthesis Soepomo advocated—combining belief in God, humanitarianism, national unity, democracy through deliberation, and social justice[^17].

His concept of the integralist state, while controversial, provided an intellectual framework that many Indonesian leaders found useful for justifying strong central authority and national unity in a diverse archipelago with hundreds of ethnic groups and languages. Soepomo argued that Indonesia's traditional cultures emphasized harmony, consensus, and collective welfare over individual rights and adversarial competition, and that the modern Indonesian state should reflect these values[^18]. This philosophy helped legitimize the strong presidential system enshrined in the 1945 Constitution and influenced Indonesian political culture for decades.

As Minister of Justice from 1945 to 1949, during the difficult revolutionary period when Indonesia fought for its independence against returning Dutch colonial forces, Soepomo worked to establish a functioning legal system under extremely challenging conditions[^19]. He oversaw the transition from colonial law to an independent Indonesian legal framework, a monumental task that involved determining which Dutch laws would remain in force, which would be abolished, and what new laws were needed. He established the first Indonesian courts and helped train Indonesian judges and lawyers to replace the departed Dutch legal officials[^20].

Soepomo made significant contributions to the preservation and recognition of adat law within the Indonesian legal system. Unlike many modernizers who wanted to completely replace customary law with uniform national codes, he advocated for legal pluralism, arguing that adat law should continue to govern matters like marriage, inheritance, and land rights within various ethnic communities[^21]. His scholarly work on adat law, including his influential textbook "Bab-bab tentang Hukum Adat" (Chapters on Adat Law), became standard references for generations of Indonesian legal scholars and practitioners[^22].

In the field of constitutional law, Soepomo's writings and lectures at the University of Indonesia helped train the first generation of Indonesian constitutional lawyers and political scientists. His courses on state theory and constitutional law were renowned for their intellectual rigor and their attempt to develop a distinctively Indonesian approach to constitutional questions rather than simply importing Western theories[^23]. Many of his students went on to become influential judges, legal scholars, and politicians who continued to grapple with the questions he had raised about the proper relationship between indigenous values and modern governance.

After serving as Minister of Justice, Soepomo continued to influence Indonesian legal and political development through his work on various commissions and his teaching. He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Indonesia and also served as rector of Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, one of Indonesia's premier institutions of higher education[^24]. In these roles, he continued to advocate for his vision of an Indonesian state that balanced traditional values with modern requirements.

Soepomo also made important contributions to education policy. As rector of Gadjah Mada University, he worked to expand access to higher education for Indonesians who had been excluded during the colonial period, while also maintaining rigorous academic standards[^25]. He believed that education was essential for nation-building and that Indonesian universities should combine the best of Western academic methods with content relevant to Indonesian society and culture.

His scholarly output was prodigious. In addition to his work on adat law and constitutional theory, Soepomo wrote extensively on legal philosophy, comparative constitutional law, and the relationship between law and society. His writings attempted to bridge the gap between Western legal science and Indonesian reality, arguing that legal systems must be understood in their cultural context rather than evaluated against abstract universal standards[^26]. This culturally-grounded approach to law influenced Indonesian legal thought and also contributed to broader debates in comparative law and legal anthropology.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Soepomo remains a controversial figure in Indonesian history, primarily because of his authoritarian tendencies and his opposition to liberal democratic principles. His concept of the integralist state has been widely criticized as providing ideological justification for authoritarianism. Critics point out that his vision of organic state unity, with no institutionalized opposition or protection of minority rights, created a constitutional framework that could easily be exploited by dictators[^27]. Indeed, both Sukarno's "Guided Democracy" (1957-1965) and Suharto's "New Order" regime (1966-1998) claimed to be implementing the principles of the 1945 Constitution that Soepomo had helped design, using it to justify suppression of political opposition and curtailment of civil liberties[^28].

During the BPUPKI debates in 1945, several other founding fathers explicitly warned against the authoritarian potential of Soepomo's integralist state. Muhammad Hatta, who would become Indonesia's first vice president, argued strongly for the inclusion of a bill of rights in the constitution, warning that without explicit protection of individual freedoms, the state could become tyrannical[^29]. Soepomo resisted these proposals, arguing that individual rights were a Western concept incompatible with Indonesian communalism and that citizens would be better protected by the inherent benevolence of a state based on family principles. History proved Hatta's concerns justified, as the absence of strong constitutional protections for human rights facilitated decades of authoritarian rule[^30].

Islamic leaders were particularly critical of Soepomo's secular approach to the state. While Soepomo included "Belief in One God" as the first principle of Pancasila, he opposed making Islam the official religion or requiring the state to enforce Islamic law. In the BPUPKI debates, he successfully argued against the "Jakarta Charter," which would have required Muslim citizens to follow sharia law[^31]. Islamic parties and scholars accused him of marginalizing Islam and imposing a secular nationalist framework on a majority-Muslim nation. This conflict between Islamic and secular nationalist visions of the Indonesian state, which Soepomo helped shape, continues to generate political tension in Indonesia today[^32].

Soepomo's collaboration with the Japanese occupation government has also drawn criticism. While many Indonesian nationalists cooperated with the Japanese out of pragmatic necessity and genuine belief that Japanese rule might lead to independence, critics argue that Soepomo and others were too willing to serve the Japanese war effort[^33]. During the occupation, Soepomo held positions in the Japanese-sponsored administration and helped draft policies that, while ostensibly preparing for Indonesian independence, also served Japanese military objectives. Some historians argue that his willingness to work within authoritarian structures during the Japanese period reflected and reinforced his own authoritarian inclinations[^34].

His concept of gotong royong (mutual cooperation), while appealing in principle, has been criticized as a form of enforced conformity that suppresses dissent. Critics argue that Soepomo idealized traditional village harmony while ignoring the power inequalities and social conflicts that existed in actual Indonesian communities[^35]. His vision of consensus-based decision-making, they contend, often meant that powerful leaders could claim unanimous support while marginalizing dissenting voices. This critique suggests that Soepomo's communitarianism was more about social control than genuine mutual aid.

From a liberal perspective, Soepomo's rejection of the separation of powers and checks and balances has been seen as a fundamental flaw in the 1945 Constitution. By concentrating power in the presidency and rejecting the idea that state institutions should check each other, he created a constitutional system vulnerable to abuse[^36]. The concentration of power that Soepomo advocated made it difficult to remove authoritarian leaders or hold them accountable, contributing to the persistence of non-democratic governance in Indonesia for most of its independent history.

Feminist scholars have criticized Soepomo's conception of the state as a "family" with the president as "father" as reinforcing patriarchal social structures and limiting women's political participation[^37]. His emphasis on traditional Indonesian values often meant accepting traditional gender hierarchies, and his legal work did little to challenge the subordinate status of women in many areas of Indonesian law, particularly in matters governed by customary and religious law.

Some scholars argue that Soepomo's vision was not truly rooted in Indonesian traditions but was heavily influenced by European organicist and corporatist theories, particularly German state theory from the 1920s and 1930s. They suggest that he selectively interpreted Indonesian traditions to fit European models that had themselves been used to justify fascist regimes, making his supposedly indigenous political philosophy actually a hybrid that imported some of the most problematic aspects of early 20th-century European political thought[^38].

## Personal Life

Soepomo married and had several children, though details about his family life remain relatively scarce in historical records, as was common for public figures of his generation who maintained strict separation between public and private spheres[^39]. His wife supported his career through the tumultuous periods of Japanese occupation and revolution, managing household affairs while he devoted himself to nation-building activities. Those who knew him personally described him as modest and unassuming despite his intellectual brilliance and political influence.

Colleagues and students remembered Soepomo as a dedicated scholar who maintained a rigorous work ethic throughout his life. He was known for his extensive personal library and his habit of working late into the night on his legal writings and academic lectures[^40]. Unlike some of the more charismatic founding fathers like Sukarno, Soepomo was not a fiery orator or magnetic public personality. His influence came from the depth of his legal knowledge, the clarity of his thinking, and his ability to synthesize complex ideas into coherent frameworks.

By temperament, Soepomo was fundamentally an intellectual and a technocrat rather than a mass politician. He was more comfortable in seminar rooms and legal chambers than on public platforms, preferring careful argumentation to emotional appeals[^41]. This scholarly disposition shaped both his strengths and his limitations as a political figure. While his intellectual contributions were profound, he sometimes seemed detached from the practical political realities and power struggles that characterized Indonesian politics, perhaps contributing to his apparent blindness to how his constitutional theories could be misused.

Friends and colleagues noted that despite his advocacy for traditional Indonesian values in political theory, Soepomo's personal lifestyle reflected his Dutch education and priyayi background. He was cosmopolitan in his intellectual interests, fluent in Dutch and German, and familiar with European culture[^42]. This combination of Western education and Indonesian cultural identity was typical of his generation of nationalist elites, who had to navigate between colonial and indigenous cultures.

Those close to him described Soepomo as deeply committed to Indonesian independence and unity, viewing his constitutional work as a patriotic duty. He genuinely believed that his integralist state theory would serve Indonesia's interests better than imported Western models, and he was reportedly troubled by later criticisms that his work had facilitated authoritarianism[^43]. However, he remained convinced throughout his life that Indonesia needed a strong, unified state to hold together its diverse population and resist both internal fragmentation and external threats.

Soepomo's health began to decline in the mid-1950s, possibly due to the stress and hardships of the revolutionary period and the intensity of his work[^44]. He continued teaching and writing despite his failing health, driven by a sense that his intellectual work was essential to Indonesia's development. His commitment to education and legal scholarship remained constant even as his physical strength waned.

He maintained relationships with his fellow founding fathers, though there were intellectual disagreements, particularly with Muhammad Hatta over constitutional questions. Despite these differences, there was mutual respect among the founding generation, united by their shared experience of struggle for independence[^45]. Soepomo was less involved in the day-to-day political battles that characterized the 1950s parliamentary democracy period, focusing instead on his academic and judicial work.

## Legacy

Soepomo died on September 12, 1958, at the age of 55, his death attributed to illness that had been developing for several years[^46]. His passing removed one of the most intellectually sophisticated voices from Indonesian public life at a time when the country was entering a period of increasing political instability that would soon lead to Sukarno's abandonment of parliamentary democracy in favor of "Guided Democracy."

Soepomo's most tangible legacy is the 1945 Constitution, which, despite numerous amendments, remains Indonesia's basic law. The constitutional framework he helped create has shown remarkable durability, surviving radical changes in political regime from revolutionary government to parliamentary democracy to Guided Democracy to New Order authoritarianism to the current reform era[^47]. Whether this durability reflects the wisdom of the constitution's design or its dangerous flexibility in accommodating various forms of governance remains debated.

His concept of Pancasila and the integralist state continues to shape Indonesian political discourse. Pancasila remains the official state ideology, taught in schools and invoked by politicians across the spectrum[^48]. The idea that Indonesia should follow its own path rather than simply copying Western or other foreign models—a core principle of Soepomo's thought—remains influential and broadly accepted across Indonesian society. However, the specific content of what this Indonesian path should be remains contested, with different political forces offering competing interpretations of Pancasila and Indonesian identity.

In Indonesian legal education, Soepomo's work on adat law and legal theory remains foundational. His textbooks are still used, and his basic insight that modern Indonesian law must somehow accommodate the country's diverse legal traditions continues to influence legal reform debates[^49]. Indonesia's legal system remains pluralistic, with Islamic law, customary law, and civil law coexisting in complex ways that reflect Soepomo's vision of legal pluralism.

The negative aspects of his legacy are also significant. The authoritarian potential he built into the 1945 Constitution was ruthlessly exploited by Suharto's New Order regime, which ruled Indonesia from 1966 to 1998. Suharto claimed to be restoring the "pure" 1945 Constitution after the experimentation of the parliamentary period and Guided Democracy, using it to justify three decades of authoritarian rule that suppressed political opposition, curtailed civil liberties, and enabled massive corruption[^50]. The constitutional amendments passed after Suharto's fall in 1998 specifically addressed many of the authoritarian features of the original constitution, adding explicit protections for human rights, establishing a constitutional court, and creating checks on presidential power—changes that implicitly acknowledged the flaws in Soepomo's original design[^51].

Contemporary Indonesian scholars are divided in their assessment of Soepomo. Some see him as a visionary who understood that Indonesia needed distinctive institutions reflecting its own cultural values rather than imported models, crediting him with providing an intellectual foundation for Indonesian national identity[^52]. Others view him as dangerously naive about authoritarianism or, more harshly, as an authoritarian himself whose ideas deliberately undermined democracy. These debates intensified during the Reform Era (post-1998) as Indonesia grappled with its authoritarian past and sought to strengthen democratic institutions.

Soepomo's legacy intersects with broader debates about Asian values, cultural relativism, and universal human rights. His argument that Indonesia should not simply adopt Western-style liberal democracy but should develop political institutions reflecting its own traditions anticipates later "Asian values" arguments made by leaders like Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew[^53]. Critics of these arguments contend that they use culture as a pretext for authoritarianism, while defenders argue that political institutions should indeed reflect local cultures rather than presuming that Western models are universally applicable.

In the field of comparative constitutional law, Soepomo's work is studied as an example of how post-colonial nations attempted to develop constitutional frameworks that synthesized indigenous traditions with modern state structures. His efforts to ground constitutional design in local culture rather than simply transplanting foreign models have influenced constitutional designers in other post-colonial nations[^54].

Educational institutions honor Soepomo's memory, with schools and academic programs named after him, recognizing his contributions to Indonesian education and legal scholarship. At Gadjah Mada University, where he served as rector, he is remembered as an important figure in the institution's history[^55]. However, these commemorations tend to emphasize his scholarship and dedication to education while glossing over the controversial aspects of his political philosophy.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Soepomo emphasize his sincere dedication to Indonesian independence and his sophisticated attempt to develop a political philosophy appropriate to Indonesian culture. Legal scholar Yusril Ihza Mahendra argues that Soepomo's integralist state concept has been misunderstood and unfairly blamed for later authoritarian abuses, contending that Soepomo's vision of consensual decision-making and organic unity, if properly implemented, could have prevented rather than enabled dictatorship[^56]. According to this interpretation, the problem was not Soepomo's theory but its distortion by leaders who claimed to follow it while actually pursuing personal power.

Scholars who study adat law credit Soepomo with preserving Indonesia's diverse legal heritage. His work documenting and systematizing customary law prevented the complete erasure of indigenous legal traditions under the pressure of legal modernization[^57]. By advocating legal pluralism, he helped Indonesia maintain cultural diversity in its legal system rather than imposing rigid uniformity. This approach is now seen as progressive in an era when indigenous rights and cultural preservation are increasingly valued.

Some political theorists appreciate Soepomo's critique of liberal democracy's limitations, particularly his observation that adversarial party politics could exacerbate social divisions in diverse societies. His emphasis on consensus and deliberation rather than majoritarian voting resonates with contemporary research on deliberative democracy and with critiques of purely procedural approaches to democratic legitimacy[^58]. Scholars in this tradition argue that Soepomo identified real problems with transplanting Western political institutions to non-Western contexts, even if his solutions were flawed.

Indonesian nationalists often view Soepomo positively as a founding father who helped establish the philosophical foundations of the nation. His work on Pancasila provided an ideological framework that could unify diverse populations with different religions, ethnicities, and traditions under a common Indonesian identity[^59]. In a sprawling archipelago with hundreds of ethnic groups, such unifying ideologies were arguably necessary for maintaining national cohesion, and Soepomo's intellectual contributions to this project are seen as invaluable.

Educational reformers credit Soepomo with helping expand access to higher education in the early independence period. His leadership at Gadjah Mada University and his advocacy for educational development helped train the first generation of Indonesian professionals who could staff government agencies, courts, and universities, reducing dependence on foreign experts[^60]. His commitment to education as a foundation for national development reflected progressive values that continue to resonate.

Some scholars argue that Soepomo's warnings about the dangers of unrestrained individualism and social fragmentation were prescient, pointing to contemporary problems in Western democracies—political polarization, declining social trust, erosion of community—as validation of his concerns about the social costs of liberal individualism[^61]. From this perspective, Soepomo's emphasis on community, mutual obligation, and social harmony addresses real human needs that pure individualism neglects.

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Soepomo's integralist state theory was fundamentally authoritarian, deliberately designed to concentrate power and suppress dissent under the guise of cultural authenticity. Political scientist Daniel Lev describes Soepomo's constitutional vision as "a prescription for dictatorship" that rejected basic democratic principles like separation of powers, political opposition, and individual rights[^62]. According to this view, the decades of authoritarianism Indonesia experienced were not aberrations but predictable consequences of the constitutional framework Soepomo created.

Human rights advocates point out that Soepomo's rejection of a bill of rights in the original 1945 Constitution left Indonesians vulnerable to state abuse. His argument that individual rights were unnecessary in a family-like state proved catastrophic in practice, as both the Sukarno and Suharto regimes violated human rights systematically while claiming to follow the constitution[^63]. The amendments added after 1998 to include explicit human rights protections are seen as corrections of Soepomo's original error.

Scholars influenced by liberal political theory argue that Soepomo misunderstood or misrepresented Indonesian traditions. They contend that his idealized vision of harmonious village life ignored real conflicts, power hierarchies, and oppression that existed in traditional Indonesian societies[^64]. His communitarianism, they argue, romanticized the past and provided ideological cover for powerful elites to suppress challenges to their authority by labeling dissent as un-Indonesian or divisive.

Some historians view Soepomo's collaboration with the Japanese occupation as morally problematic. While context matters—many nationalists worked with the Japanese hoping to advance Indonesian independence—critics argue that Soepomo was too willing to serve authoritarian regimes, first the Japanese and later the Sukarno government during Guided Democracy[^65]. This pattern suggests that his apparent comfort with authoritarian power was not merely theoretical but reflected his actual political preferences.

Islamic scholars and politicians have long criticized Soepomo's secular nationalism as marginalizing Islam in a Muslim-majority nation. His successful opposition to making Islamic law binding on Muslims is seen by some as denying the majority its religious identity[^66]. While secular nationalists view this as ensuring equality for non-Muslim minorities, Islamic critics see it as imposing Western-style secularism that is itself a foreign import, making Soepomo's claim to base the state on Indonesian traditions ring hollow.

Feminist scholars criticize Soepomo's paternalistic state philosophy as reinforcing patriarchal domination. His family metaphor for the state, with the president as father, normalized male authority and hierarchical relationships, contributing to women's political marginalization[^67]. His legal work did little to challenge discriminatory laws, particularly in areas of family law where women faced significant disadvantages. The "organic unity" he celebrated often meant accepting existing social hierarchies, including gender inequality.

Contemporary democratic theorists argue that Soepomo's legacy has been an obstacle to Indonesian democratization. The reverence for the 1945 Constitution and Pancasila that Soepomo helped establish has made constitutional reform difficult, as proposals for change face accusations of betraying the founding fathers and Indonesian identity[^68]. This constitutional conservatism, rooted in Soepomo's work, has impeded efforts to strengthen democratic institutions and accountability mechanisms.

Comparative political scientists note that other post-colonial nations that adopted similar organicist and communitarian political philosophies also experienced authoritarian governance, suggesting that the problem lies not with specific leaders distorting these ideas but with the ideas themselves[^69]. Soepomo's integralist state theory, they argue, is part of a broader pattern of post-colonial authoritarianism disguised as cultural authenticity, and Indonesia's democratic progress required partially abandoning rather than fully implementing his vision.
