## Summary

Chen Jiongming (陳炯明, January 18, 1878 – September 22, 1933) was a Chinese statesman, military leader, and revolutionary who became a key figure in the federalist movement during the Warlord Era of the Republic of China.[^1] He served as civil governor of Guangdong province from 1920 to 1922 and played a pivotal role in the Xinhai Revolution.[^2] His vision of a democratic China unified peacefully through a federal system brought him into conflict with Sun Yat-sen, who favored centralized state power achieved through military force.[^3] Though vilified for decades by both Nationalist and Communist historiography as a "counter-revolutionary warlord," modern scholars have reassessed his legacy, recognizing him as a progressive advocate for democratic reform and federalism.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Chen Jiongming was born on January 18, 1878, in Haifeng, Guangdong province, to a landlord family of moderate means.[^5] His given name was Jie (捷), meaning "victory," but when he obtained the xiucai degree in 1899, he adopted the name Jiongming (炯明), meaning "to illuminate brightly."[^6] His early childhood was marked by tragedy and hardship. His father, the only son of a gentry family, died when Chen was less than three years old, and after his grandfather's death a year later, the family's fortunes declined significantly.[^7]

From the age of five, Chen received a traditional education in the Confucian classics, which provided him with a foundation in Chinese literary and philosophical traditions.[^8] Around 1898, at approximately twenty years of age, he passed the xiucai degree examination, the entry-level qualification in the Qing imperial examination system.[^9] This achievement marked the beginning of his intellectual journey beyond traditional learning.

Chen's educational path took a decisive turn when he entered the Academy of Law and Political Science in Canton around 1904-1906, where he took the courtesy name Jingcun (競存), meaning "to compete for survival."[^10] In 1908, he graduated at the top of his class, having been trained in law and politics—disciplines that would profoundly shape his political philosophy.[^11] During this period, he was deeply influenced by revolutionary literature, particularly Zou Rong's *The Revolutionary Army*, which advocated for the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of a Chinese republic modeled on the United States.[^12] This ideal of a federated republic became a lifelong pursuit for Chen, distinguishing him from many of his revolutionary contemporaries who would later embrace centralized power structures.

In 1899, the same year he became a xiucai, Chen married Huang Yun, the daughter of his school principal.[^13] Together they would have eight children: five daughters (Buoyao, Biyao, Ruiyao, Shuyao, and Weiyao) and three sons (Dingxia, Dingyan, and Dingbing).[^14] One of his sons, Leslie H. Dingyan Chen, later became a scholar who wrote extensively about his father, including the comprehensive study "Chen Jiongming and the Federalist Movement: Regional Leadership and Nation Building in Early Republican China."[^15]

## Rise to Power

Chen Jiongming's transition from educated reformer to revolutionary leader began in the turbulent final years of the Qing dynasty. In February 1908, he persuaded over thirty men to swear support for the National Revolution at the shrine to Wen Tianxiang in Haifeng, demonstrating his early organizational abilities and commitment to revolutionary change.[^16] By early 1909, he had established the *Haifeng Self-Government Gazette*, where he served as editor-in-chief, using journalism as a tool for political reform.[^17]

His political career accelerated when he was elected to the Guangdong Provincial Assembly in 1909, where he became a prominent reformer and joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui).[^18] This position gave him a platform to advocate for constitutional reform and provided cover for more radical revolutionary activities. Chen participated in the planning of the Second Guangzhou Uprising of April 27, 1911, using his position as a senator to set up secret cells and store munitions.[^19] Though the uprising led by Huang Xing was poorly coordinated and brutally suppressed, forcing Chen to escape to Hong Kong, it demonstrated his commitment to armed revolution against the Qing.[^20]

The Xinhai Revolution of 1911 provided Chen with the opportunity to demonstrate his military leadership. By mid-October 1911, Chen had been elected commander-in-chief of a revolutionary army called the Xun Army in Hong Kong.[^21] He established headquarters in Danshui, Haifeng, and launched an uprising in Huizhou on November 3, 1911.[^22] His army was largely composed of local peasants and adopted a flag featuring the ancient well-field system symbol, signifying "land to the tiller"—a reflection of Chen's populist approach and concern for agrarian reform.[^23]

After initial resistance, the Qing commander surrendered Huizhou on November 8, 1911, and this victory proved pivotal: on November 9, Guangdong declared independence from the Qing without further bloodshed.[^24] Following this success, Hu Hanmin was elected military governor, and Chen was elected vice military governor on November 18.[^25] When Hu Hanmin left for Nanjing with Sun Yat-sen in December 1911, Chen became acting military governor of Guangdong, marking his emergence as a major political figure in the new Republic.[^26]

Between 1911 and 1920, Chen's career followed a complex trajectory as he navigated the chaotic politics of early Republican China. He served as Military Governor of Guangdong three separate times (1911–1912, 1913, and 1920–1923) and as Military Governor of Guangxi from 1921–1922.[^27] His military campaigns included participation in the second anti-Yuan Shikai campaign (January-June 1916) following Yuan's attempt to establish himself as emperor, and the Fujian campaign (June-August 1918).[^28]

From August 1918 to November 1920, Chen administered what he called "Little Model China" in southern Fujian, where he implemented progressive reforms that would later be expanded in Guangdong.[^29] In August-November 1920, Chen initiated a successful campaign to return to Guangdong, and on November 29, 1920, he welcomed Sun Yat-sen back to Canton, setting the stage for both their collaboration and eventual conflict.[^30]

## Major Achievements

Chen Jiongming's most significant contributions occurred during his administration of Guangdong province from November 1920 to January 1923, a period that represented the height of his political influence and the most comprehensive implementation of his federalist vision.[^31] His governance model earned praise from international observers and became a reference point for progressive reform in Republican China.

**Provincial Constitution and Federalism**

Chen's crowning political achievement was the Guangdong Provisional Constitution of 1921, ratified in December, which emphasized civil rights and provincial autonomy.[^32] This period marked the height of the federalist movement in China, with several other provinces drafting their own constitutions inspired by Guangdong's example.[^33] While the Guangdong Provincial Assembly worked on the provincial constitution in early 1921, Chen simultaneously drafted a "reconstruction plan" (jianshe fanglue)—a proposal for a national constitution based on federalist principles.[^34]

Chen articulated his democratic vision clearly in early 1921: "The people of China are accustomed to self-government in their village communities and if there is to be democracy in China it will have to be evolved from these communities and their tradition of self-rule… We are beginning with villages and organizing them into sub-districts under committee rule… We propose to have the county magistrates and other local offices, as well as delegates to the Provincial Assembly, chosen by popular election…"[^35] This bottom-up approach represented a distinctive alternative to the top-down centralization favored by most revolutionary leaders.

**Education Reform**

Chen strove to create an independent education system free from political interference on the grounds that such a system was crucial for the construction of a democratic society.[^36] When during the late 1920s the Nationalist Party tried to take control of education in the name of "party-ized" or "party-guided" education, Chen opposed the party vigorously, arguing that intellectual independence was essential for democracy.[^37] During the May Fourth period, Chen created with the help of anarchist intellectuals a "model" city of New Culture in Zhangzhou, Fujian, which won critical acclaim both in China and abroad.[^38]

**Labor and Social Reforms**

Governor Chen pioneered progressive labor policies that were ahead of their time in China. He took upon himself to put into practice what workers of advanced industrial nations only gained a decade later—the right of workers to collective bargaining.[^39] Using this approach, he helped settle the great Hong Kong Seamen's Strike of 1922, a fifty-two-day strike involving up to 50,000 workers that paralyzed the British colony.[^40] Despite attempts by British colonial authorities to suppress the strike, Chen provided support from Canton, including strike pay, and helped negotiate a settlement that achieved wage increases of 15% to 30% for workers.[^41]

Chen had similar ideas for organizing peasant unions as a vehicle for agrarian reforms, which he put into practice in East Guangdong from 1923 to 1925.[^42] These efforts represented a systematic attempt to empower both urban workers and rural peasants through organization and legal rights rather than through revolutionary violence.

**International Recognition**

The noted American educator and philosopher John Dewey, who visited China for a two-year lecture tour from 1919 to 1921, had extraordinarily high praise for Chen and the federalist program in Guangdong.[^43] After visiting the province in the spring of 1921, Dewey called Chen "by all odds the most impressive of all the officials whom I have met in China."[^44] In July 1921, Dewey reported in *The New Republic* on Chen's views on unifying China "by the people themselves, employing not force but the methods of normal political evolution."[^45]

Dewey was particularly impressed by Chen's personal character and modest lifestyle. He wrote in *The New Republic* that Chen "lives an almost Spartan life in a country where official position is largely prized for the luxuries it makes possible."[^46] Contemporary observers such as John Dewey and Bertrand Russell praised Chen's reform efforts, with Dewey particularly appreciating Chen's federalist approach and his commitment to building democracy from the ground up through labor reforms, educational innovations, and efforts at peaceful unification rather than military force.[^47]

**Ideological Influence**

Between 1919 and 1922, Chen Jiongming not only fostered his anarcho-federalist blueprint but also garnered support from prominent thinkers hailing from across different ideological camps, including Liang Bingxian, Chen Duxiu, and Hu Shi.[^48] This broad intellectual coalition demonstrated Chen's ability to appeal to diverse reform-minded intellectuals who saw in his federalism a viable path toward China's modernization and democratization.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his progressive reforms and international acclaim, Chen Jiongming became one of the most controversial figures in modern Chinese history, primarily due to his conflict with Sun Yat-sen and the way he was subsequently portrayed in official historiography.

**The June 16 Incident of 1922**

The defining controversy of Chen's career was the June 16 Incident of 1922, which saw his forces attack Sun Yat-sen's presidential palace in Guangzhou.[^49] The conflict stemmed from fundamental disagreements about China's future: Chen advocated making China a federation of self-governing provinces (聯省自治) and opposed Sun's plan to unite the country via a Northern Expedition (北伐).[^50] Chen, commanding the bulk of Guangdong's army, viewed Sun's militaristic approach as financially ruinous—military expenditures already consumed over 85% of the provincial budget—and likely to provoke renewed civil war without adequate preparation.[^51]

On June 16, 1922, in the name of "restoring the Constitution and removing illegitimate presidents" (which referred to both Xu Shichang of the Beiyang government and Sun Yat-sen of the Guangzhou government), Chen Jiongming's army attacked Sun's headquarters and residence in Guangzhou.[^52] At 3:00 AM, a detachment of the Guangdong Army surrounded Sun Yat-sen's Presidential Palace, though Sun, warned two hours earlier, had already escaped to the warship *Yongfeng*.[^53]

On June 17, Sun ordered the bombardment of Canton from his warship.[^54] The indiscriminate shelling lasted several hours, causing over a hundred civilian deaths and significant property damage.[^55] After further skirmishes, Sun finally left Canton for Shanghai on a British gunboat on August 9, 1922.[^56] This event, documented in contemporary KMT publications as "Chen Jiongming's Betrayal," solidified his image among Sun's followers as a betrayer who prioritized regional autonomy over national unification, allegedly to entrench personal power in Guangdong.[^57]

Most scholars conclude that Chen did not actively plan the coup, although he had ample provocation given Sun's disregard for constitutional processes and fiscal constraints.[^58] The incident precipitated Sun's turn toward an alliance with the Soviet Union and a reorganization of the Kuomintang (KMT) along Leninist lines, fundamentally changing the trajectory of Chinese revolutionary politics.[^59]

**Accusations of Warlordism and Separatism**

For decades, both Nationalist and Communist historiography portrayed Chen Jiongming as a counter-revolutionary warlord who betrayed Sun Yat-sen and obstructed the unification of China.[^60] This narrative stemmed from his opposition to Sun's centralized, one-party state and his role in the June 16 Incident.[^61] Historiographical critiques from both KMT and People's Republic of China (PRC) perspectives further vilified Chen as a "counter-revolutionary warlord," accusing him of undermining the Xinhai Revolution's legacy by fostering provincial separatism.[^62]

In mainstream accounts, he often comes across as a rather reactionary, perhaps even malevolent, militarist whose personal ambitions led him to stand as an obstacle athwart the road to progress of Sun's nationalist revolution.[^63] Chen was held accountable by Nationalists and Communists in his own day and has been held responsible for his betrayal by Chinese historians to the present day.[^64]

**Military Defeats and Exile**

Following the 1922 revolt, Chen's military position gradually deteriorated. With the help of Tang Jiyao and support from Soviet advisers and arms, the KMT retook Guangzhou in 1923, and Chen fled to Huizhou in eastern Guangdong after Sun's army defeated him.[^65] From 1923 to 1925, the Guangdong government organized two Eastern Expeditions against him.[^66] The Eastern Expeditions of 1925 included campaigns in March and again in October and November that systematically destroyed Chen's remaining forces.[^67]

The decisive defeat came in October 1925, when KMT forces under Li Jishen overran Chen's last redoubts, scattering his army and prompting his flight to Hong Kong, where his remaining forces were completely wiped out.[^68] Defeated by KMT forces backed by Soviet arms and advisers, Chen spent his later years in British Hong Kong.[^69]

**Financial Burden and Opposition to Militarism**

Critics within Sun Yat-sen's camp accused Chen of obstructing national unification by refusing to provide financial and military support for the Northern Expedition.[^70] Chen's opposition was rooted in fiscal reality: he argued that military campaigns were bankrupting Guangdong province and preventing the constitutional development and economic stabilization necessary for sustainable democracy.[^71] However, to Sun's supporters, this position appeared as either cowardice or selfish regionalism that placed local interests above national salvation.

## Personal Life

Despite his prominence as a military leader and provincial governor, Chen Jiongming maintained a remarkably modest personal lifestyle that consistently impressed observers. John Dewey noted with admiration that Chen "lives an almost Spartan life in a country where official position is largely prized for the luxuries it makes possible."[^72] This ascetic approach to power set him apart from many warlords and politicians of his era who enriched themselves through their positions.

Chen married Huang Yun in 1899, the same year he achieved the xiucai degree.[^73] Huang Yun was the daughter of Chen's school principal, suggesting that the marriage connected Chen to educated circles in his community.[^74] Together they had eight children: five daughters named Buoyao, Biyao, Ruiyao, Shuyao, and Weiyao, and three sons named Dingxia, Dingyan, and Dingbing.[^75] His son Leslie H. Dingyan Chen became a scholar and the leading authority on his father's political career, authoring the definitive biography "Chen Jiongming and the Federalist Movement: Regional Leadership and Nation Building in Early Republican China."[^76]

Chen's intellectual development was profoundly shaped by anarchist philosophy, particularly the works of Peter Kropotkin. Chen was a follower of Kropotkin who believed in "mutual aid," not class struggle, as the primary dynamic of social evolution.[^77] Village communities in Chen's vision would be united by the Kropotkinian spirit of "mutual aid" instead of Confucian family rituals.[^78] All his ideological and political efforts aimed at one ultimate goal: to drive the evolution of the world and realize "equal happiness" for all humanity, with village self-rule as the means to achieve this end.[^79]

Chen had strong intellectual affinity and political connections with many Chinese anarchists and was a great patron of the anarchist movement whenever he was in power.[^80] He was one of the founders and patrons of an anarchist assassination group during the Republican revolutionary movement of 1910-1911.[^81] Under Chen's leadership, Zhangzhou became a model anarchist city, where anarchists could operate and publish their literature freely during his administration from 1918 to 1920.[^82]

The federalist Chen Jiongming applied the concept of federation to every level of organization, building democracy from the bottom up—an anarchist strategy maintaining that ends should not be separated from the means in the process of change.[^83] This philosophical consistency between his anarchist principles and his practical governance distinguished him from many revolutionaries who abandoned their ideals once in power.

Chen's final years in Hong Kong exile demonstrated his unwavering commitment to his principles despite personal hardship. He had lived a spartan life, true to his ideals, and died in poverty.[^84] When he contracted typhoid fever in August 1933 and died on September 22, 1933, at the age of fifty-five, his family was so poor they could not afford a coffin, which was provided by the Zhigong Party and other supporters.[^85] This tragic end underscored the sincerity of his commitment to his federalist vision and his refusal to enrich himself through political position.

## Legacy

Chen Jiongming's legacy has undergone dramatic reassessment since his death, transforming from that of a vilified traitor to a recognized pioneer of democratic federalism in modern China. His story illustrates how political narratives can be rewritten as historical contexts change and new scholarly perspectives emerge.

**Founding of the Zhigong Party**

After his military defeat and exile to Hong Kong in 1925, Chen continued his political activities by helping to establish an alternative political party.[^86] On October 10, 1925, the Hongmen Zhigong Association of the Americas was reorganized in San Francisco into the China Zhi Gong Party, with Chen Jiongming elected as their first chairman.[^87] The party was founded by Chen Jiongming and Tang Jiyao, two ex-Kuomintang warlords, with a platform of federalism and multi-party democracy.[^88] The party moved its headquarters to Hong Kong in 1926 and rapidly gained members among overseas Chinese.[^89]

The party's platform called for a federal republic, a multiparty system, protection of basic freedoms, and an independent judiciary—principles that represented Chen's continued advocacy for democratic federalism despite his political defeat.[^90] Disillusioned by Sun Yat-sen's "sovietized" KMT, overseas Chinese supporters elected Chen as their leader, seeing in him an alternative vision for China's political future.[^91]

**Continued Advocacy and Writing**

In 1927, Chen published *A Proposal for the Unification of China* (中國統一芻議, *Zhongguo tongyi chuyi*), which reiterated his federalist philosophy and presented a comprehensive vision for China's democratic reconstruction.[^92] In this work, Chen saw Chinese federalism coordinating four levels of geographical division—the village, the district, the county or city, and the province—with two types of organization: traditional geographical organization and occupational or trade organization.[^93] The document addressed specific problems that had plagued the Republic since its founding, noting that "every political crisis witnessed in the past sixteen years (1911–1927) has invariably been caused by constitution-related disputes."[^94]

Chen believed that given the political, social, and linguistic realities of China in the warlord period, a federalist approach was the only feasible way to eventually establish a united, democratic republic, wanting to organize a "United States of China in the manner of the American experience."[^95] He argued for a democratic China built from the bottom up, with power shared between central, provincial, and local governments.[^96]

**Alternative Path Not Taken**

Chen's vision for a federal system is seen by some modern scholars as a viable, democratic alternative to the centralized, authoritarian paths ultimately taken by both the KMT and the Communists.[^97] The story of Chen Jiongming and federalism has since remained hidden behind Nationalist and Communist accounts of modern Chinese history.[^98] His federalist movement represented a significant, constitutive part of the New Culture and May Fourth Movements, even though it was eclipsed by the victorious centralist narratives.[^99]

Many contemporary and modern scholars recognize him as a progressive idealist and a proponent of a democratic, federal China.[^100] His advocacy of province-level programs of political, economic, and social reform that would achieve national unity in peaceful stages represented a fundamentally different approach to modernization—one that prioritized gradual democratic development over revolutionary transformation through military force or party dictatorship.[^101]

**Influence on Regional Identity**

Chen's legacy has particular resonance in Guangdong province and among Cantonese speakers who see in his federalism a validation of regional autonomy and distinctive cultural identity within a larger Chinese framework.[^102] His vision of provincial self-governance while remaining part of a federated China offers a historical precedent for those who seek greater regional autonomy without separatism.

**Death and Remembrance**

Chen contracted typhoid fever in August 1933 and died in Hong Kong on September 22, 1933, at the age of fifty-five.[^103] He had lived a spartan life, true to his ideals, and died in poverty.[^104] His family was so poor they could not afford a coffin, which was provided by the Zhigong Party and other supporters.[^105] This impoverished end testified to his integrity and his refusal to exploit political power for personal enrichment—a stark contrast to many of his contemporaries in the warlord era.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Since the late 20th century, a remarkable re-evaluation of Chen Jiongming's role has occurred in academic circles, particularly outside mainland China.[^106] Scholars have highlighted his commitment to federalism, democratic reform, and social progress, as evidenced by his administrations in Guangdong and southern Fujian.[^107] A paper by Winston Hsieh published in 1962 was the first Western scholarly work that gave a sympathetic analysis of Chen's political career with emphasis on his ideas and ideals.[^108] Hsieh observed that Chen had strong intellectual affinity and political connections with many Chinese anarchists and that he was a great patron of the anarchist movement whenever he was in power.[^109]

Modern scholars argue that Chen represented a genuine alternative vision for China's political development—one based on constitutional federalism, gradual reform, and bottom-up democratization rather than revolutionary violence and party dictatorship.[^110] His progressive labor policies, education reforms, and constitutional initiatives demonstrated that he was "not just a man of guns" but a serious political thinker who attempted to implement a coherent vision of democratic governance.[^111]

Contemporary observers such as John Dewey and Bertrand Russell praised Chen's reform efforts enthusiastically.[^112] Dewey's assessment that Chen was "by all odds the most impressive of all the officials whom I have met in China" carries significant weight given Dewey's extensive experience observing Chinese politics during his two-year visit.[^113] These international endorsements from respected intellectuals lend credibility to the view that Chen's federalist experiment represented a genuine progressive alternative to both warlordism and centralized authoritarianism.

Scholars appreciate Chen's intellectual consistency and his refusal to abandon his federalist principles even after political defeat.[^114] His continued advocacy through the Zhigong Party and his 1927 *Proposal for the Unification of China* demonstrated a principled commitment to democratic ideals that transcended personal ambition.[^115] The fact that he died in poverty, having refused to enrich himself through political power, provides powerful evidence of his sincerity.[^116]

Many contemporary and modern scholars now recognize him as a progressive idealist and a proponent of a democratic, federal China, viewing his federalist movement as a significant, constitutive part of the New Culture and May Fourth Movements.[^117] Some argue that Chen's vision of a democratic China unified peacefully through a federal system represented the road not taken—an alternative that might have spared China decades of civil war and authoritarian rule.[^118]

### Negative Views

Despite scholarly rehabilitation, Chen Jiongming remains a controversial figure, and significant criticisms of his career persist. For decades, both Nationalist and Communist historiography portrayed Chen as a counter-revolutionary warlord who betrayed Sun Yat-sen and obstructed the unification of China.[^119] This narrative, while now contested by scholars, reflected genuine concerns about Chen's actions and their consequences.

Critics argue that Chen's opposition to Sun Yat-sen's Northern Expedition, whatever its principled justifications, objectively weakened the revolutionary movement at a critical moment and contributed to continued national fragmentation.[^120] The June 16 Incident of 1922, regardless of Chen's degree of direct involvement in planning it, represented a violent attack on the revolutionary government that killed civilians and disrupted efforts at national unification.[^121] Sun Yat-sen's decision to bombard Canton from his warship, causing civilian casualties, was in direct response to Chen's forces surrounding the presidential palace.[^122]

From the perspective of Sun's supporters and later KMT and Communist historians, Chen's federalism appeared as a cover for warlord separatism—a way to maintain personal control over Guangdong under the guise of constitutional principles.[^123] In mainstream accounts, he often came across as a rather reactionary, perhaps even malevolent, militarist whose personal ambitions led him to stand as an obstacle athwart the road to progress of Sun's nationalist revolution.[^124]

Historiographical critiques from both KMT and People's Republic of China (PRC) perspectives vilified Chen as a "counter-revolutionary warlord," accusing him of undermining the Xinhai Revolution's legacy by fostering provincial separatism.[^125] This event, documented in contemporary KMT publications as "Chen Jiongming's Betrayal," solidified his image as a betrayer who prioritized regional autonomy over national unification, allegedly to entrench personal power in Guangdong.[^126]

Critics also point out that Chen's federalist experiment, despite its progressive elements, ultimately failed to achieve its goals or prevent civil war.[^127] His military defeat by KMT forces in 1925 demonstrated the vulnerability of regional autonomy movements against centralized military power backed by foreign support.[^128] Some argue that Chen's vision, however admirable in theory, was impractical in the chaotic conditions of warlord-era China, where military strength rather than constitutional principles determined political outcomes.[^129]

The fact that Chen commanded military forces and engaged in armed conflict, regardless of his stated commitment to peaceful unification, places him within the category of warlords who used violence to pursue political objectives.[^130] His forces participated in the June 16 Incident and subsequent military campaigns, contributing to the cycle of violence that plagued Republican China.[^131] From this perspective, the difference between Chen and other warlords was primarily rhetorical rather than substantive—he justified his military power with federalist ideology, but still relied on armed force to maintain his position.[^132]
