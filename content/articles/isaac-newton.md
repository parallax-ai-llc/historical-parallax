## Summary

Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author who is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the Scientific Revolution. His *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (*Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*, 1687), commonly known as the *Principia*, laid the foundations for classical mechanics with his three laws of motion and law of universal gravitation, providing a unified mathematical framework that described both terrestrial and celestial phenomena. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, including the discovery that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors, and he developed calculus independently of Leibniz. His work dominated scientific thought for over two centuries until Einstein's theory of relativity, though Newton's laws remain fundamental to physics education and most engineering applications. Despite his towering scientific achievements, Newton was a complex, often difficult personality—secretive, prone to paranoia and vengeful disputes, and devoted enormous energy to alchemy and biblical chronology, subjects now considered pseudoscientific.

## Early Life and Background

### Birth and Family

Isaac Newton was born prematurely on January 4, 1643 (December 25, 1642, by the Julian calendar then used in England) at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in Lincolnshire, England. His birth occurred during England's Civil War, approximately three months after his father, also named Isaac Newton, a prosperous but illiterate farmer, had died. Newton was born so small that his mother, Hannah Ayscough Newton, reportedly said he could have fit into a quart mug. His premature birth meant he was not expected to survive, but he defied expectations.

When Isaac was three years old, his mother remarried to Barnabas Smith, a wealthy rector from North Witham. Smith insisted Hannah leave Isaac behind with his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough, at Woolsthorpe. This abandonment profoundly traumatized young Newton. He later confessed in a list of sins from age 19: "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them." This early rejection likely contributed to Newton's lifelong insecurity, emotional instability, and difficulty forming close relationships.

### Education

Newton attended The King's School in Grantham, boarding with the local apothecary William Clarke. During this period, he showed mechanical aptitude, building sundials, windmills, and other devices. He was described as quiet and introspective, preferring solitary study to social interaction with other boys.

In 1659, at age 17, Newton's mother (now widowed for a second time) recalled him to Woolsthorpe to manage the family's farm and estate. Newton proved utterly incompetent and disinterested in farming, preferring to read books hidden in hedgerows while servants did the work. His uncle William Ayscough and schoolmaster Henry Stokes convinced Hannah that Isaac's talents lay elsewhere, and in 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge.

## Cambridge University

### Undergraduate Years (1661-1665)

Newton entered Trinity College in June 1661 as a subsizar—a student who paid reduced fees by performing menial duties for wealthy students and fellows. He studied the standard Aristotelian curriculum, which was intellectually stale and centuries out of date. However, Newton independently pursued modern philosophical and scientific works by Descartes, Galileo, Kepler, and Boyle.

His personal notes from this period, labeled *Quaestiones Quaedam Philosophicae* ("Certain Philosophical Questions"), show him grappling with fundamental questions about matter, motion, optics, and astronomy—already thinking beyond the prescribed curriculum. Newton took few notes from official lectures, instead developing ideas independently.

In 1664, Newton was elected a scholar, guaranteeing four years of financial support. He received his BA degree in April 1665.

### The Plague Years: Annus Mirabilis (1665-1666)

In summer 1665, the Great Plague forced Cambridge University to close. Newton returned to Woolsthorpe Manor for approximately 18 months. This isolation became the most productive period of his life—his *annus mirabilis* (miraculous year), though it actually spanned parts of 1665 and 1666.

During this extraordinary period, Newton made revolutionary discoveries in three separate fields:

**1. Mathematics (Calculus):**
Newton developed the mathematical framework he called "the method of fluxions" (now known as differential and integral calculus). This provided powerful tools for calculating rates of change, areas, volumes, maxima and minima, and solving differential equations. Newton kept these discoveries largely private for decades.

**2. Optics:**
Newton experimented with prisms and discovered that white light is composed of a spectrum of colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet). When he passed sunlight through a prism, it dispersed into colors. Passing these colors through a second inverted prism recombined them into white light. This disproved the prevailing theory that prisms colored light; instead, white light contains all colors, and prisms merely separate them.

**3. Gravity and Motion:**
The famous story that a falling apple inspired Newton's thinking about gravity dates from this period and was recounted by Newton himself in old age, though its literal truth is debated. Whether or not an apple actually fell, Newton made the crucial conceptual leap: the force pulling the apple down might be the same force keeping the moon in orbit around Earth. He began developing the inverse-square law of gravitation, though full mathematical treatment would wait until the *Principia* two decades later.

### Return to Cambridge and Early Career

Cambridge reopened in 1667, and Newton returned. His brilliance was now recognized, and he was elected a Fellow of Trinity College. In 1669, at just 26 years old, Newton was appointed Lucasian Professor of Mathematics, succeeding his mentor Isaac Barrow (who recommended him for the position). Barrow recognized that Newton had surpassed him in mathematical ability.

As Lucasian Professor, Newton was required to give lectures, but few students attended or understood them. He often lectured to empty rooms, returning to his chambers after the statutorily required 15 minutes "for want of hearers."

## The *Principia*: Newton's Masterwork

### Origins and Writing (1684-1687)

In 1684, astronomer Edmond Halley visited Newton at Cambridge with a problem: what curve would a planet describe if attracted to the sun by a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance? Newton immediately answered: an ellipse. When Halley asked how he knew, Newton replied he had calculated it years earlier but couldn't find the papers. Halley urged Newton to work out the mathematics and publish.

This prompted Newton to write what became *Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (*Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy*), completed in 18 months of intense work. Halley personally financed publication after the Royal Society's funds were exhausted printing a book on fish.

The *Principia* was published in Latin in July 1687 in three "Books":
- **Book I**: Mathematical principles of natural philosophy
- **Book II**: Motion in resisting mediums (fluids)
- **Book III**: System of the world (applying mathematical principles to astronomy)

### Newton's Laws of Motion

The *Principia* established three laws of motion that became the foundation of classical mechanics:

**First Law (Inertia):**
"Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed thereon."

Objects at rest stay at rest; objects in motion stay in motion at constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. This contradicted Aristotelian physics, which claimed objects naturally come to rest.

**Second Law (F = ma):**
"The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the motive force impressed; and is made in the direction of the right line in which that force is impressed."

Force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). This quantifies how forces change motion, providing the fundamental equation of dynamics.

**Third Law (Action-Reaction):**
"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts."

For every force, there is an equal and opposite force. When you push a wall, it pushes back with equal force.

### Law of Universal Gravitation

Newton's law of universal gravitation was revolutionary:

**F = G(m₁m₂)/r²**

Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

This single law:
- Explained Kepler's laws of planetary motion
- Explained ocean tides (gravitational pull of moon and sun)
- Explained why objects fall on Earth
- Unified terrestrial and celestial physics
- Predicted return of comets (Halley's Comet, 1758)

The *Principia* provided the first comprehensive, mathematically rigorous physical theory describing the entire universe with a single set of principles.

## Optics and Light

### Early Optical Experiments

Newton's optical experiments began during the plague years. His most famous experiment involved passing sunlight through a prism, dispersing it into a spectrum on a wall. The prevailing theory (by Descartes and others) held that prisms somehow modified or "colored" white light. 

Newton proved otherwise through ingenious experiments:
- He isolated one color from the spectrum using slits
- Passed that single color through a second prism
- It did not disperse further—the color remained pure
- Different colors refracted by different amounts
- Recombining all colors through an inverted prism produced white light

This demonstrated that white light is composite; prisms separate, not create, colors.

### Reflecting Telescope

Refracting telescopes of Newton's era suffered from chromatic aberration—different colors focus at different points, creating blurred colored fringes. Newton realized this was inherent to lenses dispersing light.

In 1668, Newton designed and built the first practical reflecting telescope, using a curved mirror instead of lenses. Mirrors reflect all colors identically, eliminating chromatic aberration. His design (now called the Newtonian telescope) remains widely used by amateur astronomers.

The Royal Society was impressed, and Newton was elected Fellow in 1672.

### *Opticks* (1704)

Newton's comprehensive optical work, *Opticks*, was published in 1704 (in English, unlike the Latin *Principia*), written years earlier but held until after rival Robert Hooke's death in 1703. 

The book detailed:
- Refraction and dispersion experiments
- Theory that light consists of corpuscles (particles)
- "Newton's rings"—interference patterns in thin films
- Queries on nature of light, matter, and forces

Newton's corpuscular theory of light competed with Christiaan Huygens' wave theory. Eventually, both proved partly correct: light exhibits both particle and wave properties (wave-particle duality).

## The Calculus Priority Dispute

### Independent Development

Newton developed calculus (his "method of fluxions and fluents") during 1665-1666, using it privately for astronomical calculations. He did not publish, sharing results only with select correspondents.

German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz independently developed calculus in 1675-1676, using different notation. Leibniz published first (1684). Newton's unpublished work dated earlier.

### The Bitter Controversy

In the 1690s-1710s, a bitter priority dispute erupted, with each side accusing the other of plagiarism. Newton believed Leibniz saw his earlier work during a 1676 London visit. Leibniz accused Newton of claiming priority unfairly.

As president of the Royal Society, Newton appointed a "neutral" committee to investigate—which he secretly controlled, even writing the committee's report anonymously. It declared Leibniz a plagiarist. Newton continued attacks even after Leibniz's death in 1716.

**Modern Consensus:**
Both independently invented calculus. Leibniz's notation (dy/dx, ∫) proved superior and was adopted universally. Newton's fluxional notation became obsolete. The dispute revealed Newton's petty, vindictive side and damaged continental-British mathematical relations for generations.

## Personal Life and Character

### Physical Appearance

Contemporary accounts describe Newton as:
- Medium height (about 5'6")
- Robust build in youth, slight in old age
- Gray eyes, white hair
- Rarely exercised
- Often disheveled and unwashed during intense work periods

### Personality

Newton was extraordinarily complex:

**Positive Traits:**
- Brilliant, creative mind
- Intense focus and concentration
- Perfectionism in research
- Modesty about some achievements

**Negative Traits:**
- Insecure and hypersensitive to criticism
- Vindictive toward rivals (Hooke, Leibniz, Flamsteed)
- Secretive, hoarded discoveries
- Paranoid (once accused friend Locke of trying to "embroil him with women")
- Suffered at least two nervous breakdowns (1678, 1693)

### Relationships

**Never Married:**
Newton remained celibate his entire life. Whether this was due to asexuality, religious conviction, psychological issues, or devotion to work remains debated. He formed few close friendships.

**Notable Relationships:**
- Friendship with mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier (possibly romantic feelings, though not consummated)
- Correspondence with philosopher John Locke
- Mentored niece Catherine Barton, who kept house for him
- Bitter rivalries with Hooke and Leibniz
- Patron relationship with Halley

### Nervous Breakdowns

In 1693, Newton suffered a severe nervous breakdown, writing paranoid letters to friends accusing them of betrayal, ceasing mathematical work, suffering insomnia. Recovery took months. Causes debated: mercury poisoning from alchemy experiments, psychological stress, or overwork.

---

## Alchemy and Theology

### Alchemical Studies

Modern scholars accessing Newton's unpublished papers were shocked to discover he wrote more on alchemy than physics. He conducted thousands of alchemical experiments seeking the Philosopher's Stone, transmutation of metals, and the "secret fire."

Newton's alchemy wasn't mere gold-seeking but a serious quest to understand matter's fundamental nature. However, alchemical theories (based on mystical correspondences rather than experimental evidence) proved fruitless. Some speculate mercury  poisoning from alchemical experiments contributed to his 1693 breakdown and erratic behavior.

### Theology and Biblical Chronology

Newton was deeply religious but held unorthodox views:
- **Arianism**: Denied the Trinity, believing Jesus subordinate to God the Father
- This was heresy in England; he kept it secret (would have lost Cambridge position)
- Studied biblical prophecy intensively
- Calculated dates of biblical events

Newton wrote approximately 1.3 million words on theology—more than on natural philosophy. He believed God created the universe as described in the *Principia* but occasionally intervened to prevent irregularities.

## Royal Mint and Later Public Life

### Warden and Master of the Royal Mint

In 1696, through political connections, Newton was appointed Warden of the Royal Mint, moving to London. In 1699 he became Master of the Mint, a lucrative position he held until death.

**Responsibilities:**
- Oversaw England's Great Recoinage (1696) to address clipping and counterfeiting
- Prosecuted counterfeiters with zeal—some were hanged, drawn, and quartered
- Reformed coinage quality and efficiency
- Made Mint profitable

Newton was ruthless: personally interrogating suspects in Newgate Prison, gathering evidence, ensuring convictions. This practical administrative work contrasted sharply with his abstract scientific pursuits.

### Royal Society President

Elected president of the Royal Society in 1703, Newton wielded power autocratically for 24 years until death. He:
- Reformed Society's finances
- Moved meetings to his residence
- Settled scores with enemies
- Dominated natural philosophy in Britain

### Knighthood

In 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton (the first scientist honored thus), though the knighthood was likely for political services to the crown rather than scientific achievements.

## Legacy and Influence

### Scientific Impact

Newton's work dominated physics for over 200 years:
- **Classical Mechanics**: Remained unchallenged until Einstein (special relativity 1905, general relativity 1915)
- **Engineering**: Newtonian mechanics still used for most engineering (buildings, bridges, vehicles, spacecraft trajectories)
- **Physics Education**: Newton's laws taught to every physics student
- **Mathematics**: Calculus revolutionized mathematics, enabling modern science

### Philosophical Impact

Newton established the mechanistic worldview:
- Universe operates by mathematical laws
- Natural phenomena are predictable
- Reason and mathematics can unlock nature's secrets
- Influenced Enlightenment thinking profoundly

### Limitations and Supersession

Einstein's relativity showed Newton's laws:
- Are approximations valid at everyday speeds and scales
- Break down at speeds approaching light or in strong gravitational fields
- Gravity is spacetime curvature, not force

Quantum mechanics revealed Newton's mechanics doesn't apply at atomic scales.

However, Newton's laws remain excellent approximations for vast domains, testament to their power.

## Conflicts and Controversies

### Hooke Dispute

Robert Hooke and Newton feuded for decades over:
- Priority in optics (Hooke claimed prior color theory)
- Inverse-square law (Hook claimed he told Newton about it)
- General antipathy

Newton's "shoulders of giants" quote (1675 letter to Hooke) is often seen as magnanimous, but some scholars interpret it as mocking Hooke's short stature.

After Hooke's death (1703), Newton allegedly destroyed Hooke's portrait from Royal Society.

### Flamsteed Dispute

John Flamsteed, Astronomer Royal, clashed with Newton over:
- Publishing Flamsteed's incomplete star catalogue
- Newton needed data for lunar theory
- Flamsteed felt his work was stolen
- Legal battles ensued

Newton used political power to force publication, angering Flamsteed.

## Death and Burial

Newton died during the night of March 20-21, 1727 (March 31, Gregorian calendar), in his sleep at his  Kensington home, aged 84. He was buried in Westminster Abbey on March 28—a rare honor for a commoner and reflecting his stature.

French philosopher Voltaire, attending the funeral, wrote: "I have seen a professor of mathematics, only because he was great in his vocation, buried like a king who had done good to his subjects."

Newton left a large estate (approximately £32,000) to relatives, having accumulated wealth from the Mint position.

> "I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me."

> "Plato is my friend — Aristotle is my friend — but my greatest friend is truth."

> "Tact is the knack of making a point without making an enemy."

> "Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things."
