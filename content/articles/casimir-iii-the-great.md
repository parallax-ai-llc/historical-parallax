## Summary

Casimir III the Great (Polish: Kazimierz III Wielki) was King of Poland from 1333 until his death in 1370, and remains the only Polish monarch to receive the epithet "the Great" during his lifetime. His reign marked a golden age of medieval Poland, characterized by extensive legal reforms, economic development, territorial expansion through diplomacy rather than warfare, and unprecedented protection of Jewish communities. He transformed Poland from a fragmented, war-torn kingdom into a prosperous, centralized state with a sophisticated legal system and thriving urban centers. Known for the saying that he "found Poland built of wood and left it built of stone," Casimir's legacy as a state-builder, lawgiver, and protector of minorities endures as a foundational period in Polish history.

## Early Life and Background

Casimir was born on April 30, 1310, in Kowal, Poland, as the third and youngest son of King Władysław I the Elbow-high and Jadwiga of Greater Poland. His birth came during a tumultuous period in Polish history, when the kingdom had only recently been reunified after centuries of fragmentation following the death of Bolesław III Wrymouth in 1138. His father, Władysław I, had spent decades fighting to restore the Polish kingdom, finally achieving coronation in 1320 after expelling Bohemian forces and consolidating various duchies under his rule.[^1]

As the youngest son, Casimir was not initially expected to inherit the throne. His older brother Stephen died young, leaving only Casimir and his brother Władysław. The young prince received an education befitting medieval royalty, studying Latin, theology, and the arts of governance and warfare. However, his upbringing was marked by the constant warfare that characterized his father's reign, particularly conflicts with the Teutonic Knights to the north and Bohemia to the west.[^2]

The political situation Casimir inherited was precarious. Poland had lost Pomerania and Gdańsk to the Teutonic Knights, was threatened by Bohemian expansion, and faced potential Hungarian aggression. The kingdom's economy was devastated by decades of warfare, its legal system was fragmented and inconsistent across different regions, and the nobility held significant power that limited royal authority. These challenges would define Casimir's early priorities as king.[^3]

Casimir's father arranged his marriage to Aldona (baptized as Anna) of Lithuania, daughter of Grand Duke Gediminas, in 1325 when Casimir was only fifteen years old. This dynastic alliance was crucial in securing Poland's northeastern border and established a precedent for Polish-Lithuanian cooperation that would culminate in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth centuries later. The marriage also demonstrated the diplomatic approach that would characterize Casimir's later reign, preferring strategic alliances to military confrontation.[^4]

## Rise to Power

Casimir ascended to the Polish throne on March 2, 1333, following his father's death. He was twenty-three years old and faced immediate challenges from multiple directions. The Teutonic Knights controlled significant Polish territories along the Baltic coast, Bohemia claimed suzerainty over Silesia, and the kingdom's internal administration was weak and fragmented. Unlike his father, who had spent his reign in almost continuous warfare, Casimir quickly demonstrated a preference for diplomatic solutions and internal development over military conquest.[^5]

One of Casimir's first major political acts was negotiating the Treaty of Trentschin (1335) with King John of Bohemia and King Charles I of Hungary. In this agreement, Casimir renounced Polish claims to Silesia in exchange for Bohemia's recognition of Polish sovereignty and renunciation of claims to the Polish crown. While controversial and seen by some as a capitulation, the treaty secured Poland's southern and western borders, allowing Casimir to focus on internal reforms and eastward expansion. The treaty demonstrated Casimir's pragmatic approach to international relations, sacrificing prestige for practical security.[^6]

Similarly, Casimir negotiated the Treaty of Kalisz (1343) with the Teutonic Knights, temporarily resolving the conflict over Pomerania and Kujawy. While Poland did not regain all lost territories, the treaty brought peace to the northern border and allowed Casimir to consolidate his rule. These diplomatic achievements, while criticized by martial-minded nobles who desired military glory, established Poland as a stable kingdom capable of negotiating as an equal with its powerful neighbors.[^7]

Casimir systematically worked to strengthen royal authority against the fragmented power of regional nobles and clergy. He traveled extensively throughout his kingdom, personally adjudicating disputes and demonstrating royal presence in remote regions that had rarely seen the king. He established a more efficient administrative system, appointing royal officials (starostas) to govern key territories and cities, gradually replacing the feudal system of hereditary lordships with a more centralized bureaucracy answerable to the crown.[^8]

The young king also cultivated relationships with Poland's emerging merchant class and urban centers. He recognized that economic prosperity would strengthen both his kingdom and his own position, leading him to grant numerous charters and privileges to cities, encouraging trade and craftsmanship. This urban policy not only generated tax revenue but also created a counterbalance to noble power, as prosperous cities looked to the king for protection of their commercial interests.[^9]

## Major Achievements

Casimir's most enduring achievement was his comprehensive legal reform, earning him recognition as the "Father of Polish Jurisprudence." Between 1347 and 1362, he promulgated two major legal codes: the Statutes of Wiślica for Lesser Poland and similar statutes for Greater Poland. These codes unified and systematized Polish law, replacing the chaotic patchwork of customary laws, regional privileges, and clerical regulations that had previously governed the kingdom. The statutes addressed criminal law, property rights, inheritance, and commercial regulations, providing a consistent legal framework across the kingdom.[^10]

The Statutes of Wiślica represented a sophisticated legal document for medieval Europe, incorporating principles of proportional justice, protection of property rights, and limitations on arbitrary punishment. Casimir's legal reforms included provisions protecting peasants from excessive exploitation by nobility, regulations ensuring fair weights and measures in commerce, and standardized criminal penalties that reduced the role of vendetta and private justice. These laws remained the foundation of Polish jurisprudence for centuries, with some provisions surviving into the 18th century.[^11]

Casimir earned his title "the Great" partly through his extensive building program, which transformed Poland's physical landscape. He founded over fifty new towns and fortified approximately seventy castles, many built in stone or brick to replace earlier wooden fortifications. Major construction projects included the rebuilding of Kraków Castle, the construction of the fortified town of Kazimierz near Kraków, and numerous churches and monasteries. His building program served both defensive and economic purposes, as fortified towns became centers of trade and administration.[^12]

The king's economic policies fostered unprecedented prosperity. He reformed the currency, introducing the krakowian groat, which became a stable medium of exchange and facilitated trade. He encouraged mining, particularly of salt and metals, establishing royal monopolies that generated substantial revenue. Casimir invested in infrastructure, improving roads and establishing market towns along trade routes. He attracted foreign merchants and craftsmen, offering privileges and protections that made Poland an attractive destination for economic migration.[^13]

Casimir's protection of Jewish communities represents one of his most significant and controversial legacies. In 1334, he confirmed and expanded the Statute of Kalisz (originally issued in 1264), which granted Jews legal protection, religious freedom, economic rights, and judicial autonomy. At a time when Jews faced persecution, expulsion, and violence across much of Europe, Casimir welcomed them to Poland, recognizing their economic value and apparently holding genuine principles of tolerance. Jewish communities flourished under his protection, establishing Poland as a center of Jewish life that would endure for centuries.[^14]

The king pursued territorial expansion primarily through diplomacy and dynastic politics rather than warfare. His greatest success came in the east, where he annexed the Ruthenian principalities of Galicia and Volhynia (parts of modern Ukraine) following the extinction of the local dynasty. These acquisitions nearly doubled Poland's territory and population, providing access to lucrative trade routes and fertile agricultural lands. Unlike western territories lost to Bohemia, these eastern expansions proved permanent and fundamentally altered Poland's demographic and cultural composition.[^15]

Casimir founded the University of Kraków in 1364, one of the oldest universities in Central Europe and the second in the region after Prague. The university initially included faculties of liberal arts, medicine, and law (though theology was added later). This institution became a major center of learning, attracting scholars from across Europe and training generations of Polish administrators, clergy, and intellectuals. The university's founding demonstrated Casimir's commitment to cultural development and his recognition that a strong state required educated officials and clergy.[^16]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Casimir faced significant criticism from various quarters during his reign and in historical assessment. The nobility resented his centralization efforts, which diminished their traditional autonomy and power. His legal reforms, while beneficial to peasants and merchants, limited noble prerogatives in administering justice and exploiting their estates. Some magnates viewed his diplomatic approach as weakness, preferring military glory to pragmatic treaty-making. These tensions occasionally erupted into noble resistance, though Casimir generally managed to suppress opposition without major conflict.[^17]

The king's personal life generated substantial controversy, particularly regarding his marriages and relationships. After the death of his first wife Aldona in 1339, Casimir married Adelaide of Hesse in 1341, but the marriage was childless and allegedly unhappy, ending in separation around 1356. He then entered relationships that the Church considered bigamous or adulterous. His relationship with Rokiczana (or Kristina), a widow, produced several daughters, and he later involved himself with Jadwiga of Żagań, who bore him three more daughters. The Church refused to recognize these unions, creating a succession crisis as Casimir had no legitimate male heir.[^18]

Casimir's accommodation with the Teutonic Knights through the Treaty of Kalisz remained controversial throughout his reign. Many Poles viewed the loss of Pomerania and Gdańsk as a national humiliation that should be reversed through military action rather than accepted through treaty. Critics argued that Casimir's diplomatic approach represented cowardice or lack of martial virtue, unfavorably comparing him to his warrior father. This criticism persisted even as Casimir's policies brought prosperity and stability, reflecting the tension between medieval martial values and practical statecraft.[^19]

The king's favorable treatment of Jews, while economically beneficial and morally progressive by modern standards, generated resentment among some Christians, particularly urban craftsmen who competed with Jewish merchants and artisans. Church officials occasionally complained that Casimir's protections undermined efforts to convert Jews or limit their influence. Some chroniclers accused him of having Jewish mistresses, likely an anti-Semitic fabrication designed to discredit his protective policies. These tensions foreshadowed the antisemitism that would periodically afflict Poland in later centuries.[^20]

Casimir's eastern expansion into Ruthenian territories, while successful, created long-term complications for Poland. The incorporation of Orthodox Christian populations introduced religious complexity into a previously Catholic kingdom. The Lithuanian and Ruthenian nobility in newly acquired territories demanded recognition of their privileges and positions, creating a multi-ethnic nobility that sometimes resisted central authority. These eastern acquisitions also drew Poland into conflicts with Lithuania and the Golden Horde, expanding the kingdom's strategic vulnerabilities.[^21]

His failure to produce a legitimate male heir created a succession crisis that threatened his life's work. Despite his extensive reforms and achievements, Casimir could not ensure dynastic continuity. He designated his nephew Louis I of Hungary as his successor, but this arrangement ultimately led to the Jagiellon dynasty through Louis's daughter Jadwiga, rather than continuing Casimir's direct line. Some historians argue that his failure to resolve the succession issue through either divorce and remarriage or legitimizing his illegitimate sons represented a serious political failure.[^22]

---

## Personal Life

Casimir's personal life was marked by complexity, particularly regarding his marriages and relationships with women. His first marriage to Aldona (Anna) of Lithuania in 1325 was politically motivated but apparently became affectionate. Contemporary sources suggest mutual respect between the couple, and Aldona's death in 1339 after fourteen years of marriage reportedly affected Casimir deeply. The marriage produced several children, but none survived to adulthood, a tragedy that would haunt Casimir's reign and complicate the succession.[^23]

His second marriage to Adelaide of Hesse in 1341 proved disastrous. The union, arranged to create an alliance with German princes, lacked affection from the start. Adelaide reportedly found Poland barbaric compared to German courts, while Casimir considered her haughty and unsuitable. The marriage produced no children, and the couple separated around 1356, though the Church refused to grant an annulment. This created a canonical impediment to Casimir's subsequent relationships, which the Church regarded as adulterous or bigamous.[^24]

Casimir's relationship with Rokiczana (also called Kristina Rokiczana), a widow of a wealthy burgher, began in the 1350s and produced several daughters, including Anna, Kunegunda, and Jadwiga. He genuinely cared for Rokiczana and their children, granting them substantial properties and arranging advantageous marriages for the daughters to nobles. However, the Church's refusal to recognize this union meant the children were considered illegitimate and could not inherit the throne, a source of frustration for Casimir.[^25]

Later in life, Casimir became involved with Jadwiga of Żagań (also called Hedwig of Żagań), allegedly a granddaughter of a former Silesian duke. This relationship produced three more daughters. Some sources suggest Casimir attempted to contract a marriage with Jadwiga, but Church authorities refused recognition due to his existing marriage to Adelaide. The king's romantic life thus became a source of ecclesiastical tension, with papal legates occasionally threatening sanctions while Casimir largely ignored their objections, demonstrating his confidence and independence.[^26]

Contemporary descriptions portray Casimir as physically imposing, energetic, and charismatic. He was tall for his era, athletic, and enjoyed hunting and outdoor pursuits. Unlike many monarchs who remained in their capitals, Casimir traveled constantly throughout his kingdom, personally inspecting fortifications, adjudicating legal disputes, and demonstrating royal presence. This peripatetic style of kingship helped him maintain control and gather information about conditions throughout Poland.[^27]

Casimir was known for his intelligence and pragmatism rather than scholarly learning. While literate and educated in Latin, he was more interested in practical governance than theology or philosophy. He displayed considerable diplomatic skill, understanding when to compromise and when to stand firm. His patronage of arts and architecture reflected both personal taste and political calculation, as impressive buildings enhanced royal prestige and demonstrated the kingdom's prosperity.[^28]

The king reportedly enjoyed luxury and good living, maintaining a lavish court that attracted artists, musicians, and scholars. He appreciated fine clothing, good food, and entertainment, using courtly splendor as a tool of statecraft to impress foreign ambassadors and reward loyal nobles. This contrasted with his father's austere military court, signaling a shift from warrior-king to sophisticated monarch ruling through law and administration rather than solely through martial prowess.[^29]

## Legacy

Casimir III's death on November 5, 1370, at the royal castle in Kraków marked the end of the Piast dynasty's direct male line, which had ruled Poland since its founding. His passing created immediate succession complications, as his nephew Louis of Hungary assumed the Polish crown, beginning a period of foreign dynasties that would eventually lead to the Jagiellon era. However, Casimir's institutional and legal legacy proved more enduring than his bloodline, as the foundations he established survived dynastic changes and shaped Polish development for centuries.[^30]

The saying that Casimir "found Poland built of wood and left it built of stone" captures his transformative impact on Poland's physical infrastructure and institutional foundations. The castles, churches, and fortified towns he constructed became lasting symbols of Polish royal power and cultural achievement. Many of these structures survived into modernity, with Casimir's architectural legacy remaining visible in Poland's historic cities, particularly Kraków, which became the cultural and administrative heart of the kingdom under his rule.[^31]

Casimir's legal reforms established principles of jurisprudence that influenced Polish law through the early modern period. The Statutes of Wiślica and companion legislation created a legal tradition emphasizing written law over arbitrary custom, royal justice over feudal privilege, and procedural regularity over private vengeance. These principles contributed to the development of Poland's unique political culture, including the later concept of "Golden Liberty" and the importance of law in limiting arbitrary power.[^32]

His protection of Jewish communities established Poland as a center of Jewish life in Europe, a position it maintained until the Holocaust. For centuries, Poland hosted the world's largest Jewish population, preserving Yiddish culture, producing influential rabbinical scholars, and developing distinctive Jewish cultural forms. While later periods saw persecution and tragedy, the foundation Casimir laid created centuries of Jewish-Polish coexistence and cultural development, making his protective policies historically significant beyond his era.[^33]

The University of Kraków (later renamed Jagiellonian University) became one of Europe's leading educational institutions, training scholars, clergy, and administrators who spread Polish cultural influence. Notable alumni included Nicolaus Copernicus, and the university became a center of astronomical, mathematical, and philosophical learning. The institution's longevity and influence made Casimir's educational patronage one of his most significant contributions to European intellectual history.[^34]

Casimir's diplomatic approach to international relations, emphasizing treaties and alliances over military conquest, established a tradition of Polish statecraft that balanced power politics with pragmatic negotiation. His eastern expansion laid groundwork for the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, arguably the most distinctive political achievement of the Polish nation. By incorporating Ruthenian territories and establishing precedents for multi-ethnic governance, Casimir shaped Poland's evolution into a diverse, tolerant state quite different from the ethnically homogeneous kingdoms of Western Europe.[^35]

In Polish national consciousness, Casimir occupies a unique position as the only monarch granted the epithet "the Great" and as a symbol of just, effective governance. During periods of national crisis or foreign occupation, Polish historians and patriots looked back to Casimir's reign as a golden age of independence, prosperity, and cultural achievement. His image appeared in 19th-century romantic nationalism as an ideal ruler, and communist-era historians emphasized his protection of peasants against feudal exploitation. This adaptability of his legacy to different political contexts demonstrates the enduring power of his historical reputation.[^36]

Modern Poland honors Casimir through numerous monuments, institutions, and place names. Towns he founded retain his name, universities celebrate his patronage of learning, and legal scholars acknowledge his foundational role in Polish jurisprudence. The 650th anniversary of his death in 2020 prompted renewed scholarly attention and public commemorations, demonstrating that his legacy remains vital to Polish historical identity more than six centuries after his death.[^37]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic historians generally regard Casimir III as one of medieval Poland's most effective and significant rulers, crediting him with transforming Poland from a fragmented, war-torn kingdom into a prosperous, centralized state. Norman Davies, in his comprehensive "God's Playground: A History of Poland," describes Casimir as "the greatest of the Piast monarchs" whose reign represented "the apogee of medieval Polish development." Davies emphasizes Casimir's legal reforms, economic policies, and territorial expansion as establishing foundations for Poland's later golden age in the 16th century.[^38]

Polish historians have consistently celebrated Casimir's achievements, particularly his role as lawgiver and state-builder. Oskar Halecki, in "A History of Poland," argues that Casimir's legal codifications were "comparable to the great legislative achievements of other European monarchs of the age" and credits him with creating "the institutional framework that would sustain Polish statehood through subsequent centuries of challenge." Halecki particularly praises Casimir's ability to balance competing interests among nobility, clergy, burghers, and peasants.[^39]

Scholars of Jewish history honor Casimir as an exceptional protector of Jewish communities during an era of widespread persecution. Bernard Weinryb, in "The Jews of Poland: A Social and Economic History," characterizes Casimir's policies as "remarkably progressive for the medieval period," noting that "his protection enabled the establishment of Jewish communities that would become centers of religious and cultural life for centuries." Weinryb argues that Casimir's tolerance stemmed from both economic pragmatism and genuine humanitarian principles.[^40]

Legal historians recognize Casimir as a pivotal figure in the development of Central European jurisprudence. Juliusz Bardach, a leading expert on Polish legal history, writes that "the Statutes of Wiślica represented a sophisticated synthesis of Roman law, canon law, and customary Polish traditions, creating a legal system that balanced royal authority with recognition of traditional rights and privileges." Bardach credits Casimir with establishing principles of legal procedure and property rights that influenced Polish law into the modern era.[^41]

Economic historians praise Casimir's policies for fostering commercial development and urban growth. Marian Małowist, in studies of medieval Polish economy, argues that Casimir's "creation of favorable conditions for trade, standardization of currency, and protection of merchants established Poland as an important participant in the northern European commercial network." Małowist notes that the prosperity Casimir created funded both cultural development and military defense.[^42]

Architectural historians celebrate Casimir's building program as transforming Poland's cultural landscape. Andrzej Tomaszewski, in studies of medieval Polish architecture, describes how Casimir's "systematic construction of stone fortifications and churches introduced Gothic architectural styles to Poland and created urban centers that remain significant to this day." Tomaszewski argues that Casimir's patronage attracted skilled craftsmen and artists who elevated Polish cultural achievement.[^43]

Comparative historians studying medieval state-building place Casimir alongside other successful 14th-century monarchs. Joseph Strayer, in "On the Medieval Origins of the Modern State," includes Casimir among rulers who "successfully centralized authority, codified law, and established bureaucratic administration that transformed personal lordship into territorial sovereignty." Strayer notes that Casimir achieved this transformation with less violence and disruption than many Western European monarchs.[^44]

### Negative Views

Some historians criticize Casimir's territorial concessions, particularly the Treaty of Trentschin's recognition of Bohemian control over Silesia. Marian Biskup argues that "Casimir's willingness to sacrifice Silesia represented a failure of Polish statecraft that had permanent consequences, as Silesia's incorporation into Bohemia and later Prussia removed a wealthy, culturally Polish territory from the kingdom." Biskup contends that military pressure might have achieved better results than diplomatic accommodation.[^45]

Critics of Casimir's eastern expansion argue that incorporating Ruthenian territories created problems that plagued Poland for centuries. Daniel Stone, in "The Polish-Lithuanian State, 1386-1795," suggests that "the acquisition of Orthodox Christian territories introduced religious and ethnic complications that contributed to Poland's eventual weakness," noting that "the multi-confessional character of the expanded kingdom created vulnerabilities that enemies could exploit." Stone questions whether eastern expansion was worth the strategic complications it created.[^46]

Feminist historians have criticized Casimir's treatment of women, particularly his serial relationships and abandonment of his second wife Adelaide. Anna Zapalec writes that "despite his reputation for justice, Casimir's personal life reflected typical medieval patriarchal attitudes, treating women as political tools or objects of desire rather than autonomous individuals." Zapalec notes the contradiction between his legal protections for subjects and his disregard for the women in his life.[^47]

Some scholars question the depth of Casimir's commitment to justice and law, suggesting his reforms were primarily aimed at centralizing royal power rather than protecting subjects. Jerzy Wyrozumski argues that "while Casimir's legal codes appeared progressive, they primarily served to replace noble and ecclesiastical jurisdictions with royal courts, increasing the king's power and revenue rather than genuinely protecting peasants or merchants." This interpretation views Casimir as a pragmatic power-builder rather than an idealistic reformer.[^48]

Critics of Casimir's religious policies argue that his conflicts with the Church over his marriages demonstrated disrespect for ecclesiastical authority and moral standards. Henryk Paszkiewicz contends that "Casimir's defiance of Church teaching on marriage, combined with his protection of Jews, suggested a secular orientation that weakened religious unity and authority." Paszkiewicz suggests this contributed to later religious conflicts in Poland.[^49]

Economic historians critical of Casimir's policies argue that his urban favoritism and protection of Jewish merchants created resentment among Polish Christian burghers and nobles that had long-term negative consequences. Aleksander Gieysztor suggests that "the privileges granted to Jews and foreign merchants, while economically beneficial in the short term, generated ethnic and religious tensions that periodically erupted into violence." Gieysztor questions whether Casimir's economic policies created sustainable prosperity or merely enriched specific groups at others' expense.[^50]

Some historians argue that Casimir's failure to secure the succession represented a fundamental failure of medieval kingship. Paweł Jasienica writes that "a king's primary duty was to ensure dynastic continuity, and Casimir's inability to produce a legitimate male heir meant that his achievements were vulnerable to dissipation under foreign dynasties." Jasienica contends that personal indulgence undermined political responsibility.[^51]

Post-colonial scholars have questioned the nationalist historiography surrounding Casimir, arguing that traditional Polish histories uncritically celebrate his expansion into Ruthenian territories without acknowledging the perspective of conquered populations. Serhii Plokhy suggests that "from a Ukrainian perspective, Casimir's annexation of Galicia and Volhynia represented the beginning of Polish domination that lasted for centuries," challenging the narrative of benevolent expansion that dominates Polish accounts.[^52]

## Famous Quotes

> "I found Poland made of wood, and I leave it made of stone and brick." - Attributed to Casimir III on his deathbed

This saying, whether authentically spoken or later attributed to Casimir, encapsulates his legacy as a builder and state reformer. It refers both to his extensive construction program of stone castles and fortifications, and metaphorically to his transformation of Poland's institutional and legal foundations from fragmented customs to codified law.[^53]

> "Let the law rule, not the sword." - From the preamble to the Statutes of Wiślica

This principle, articulated in Casimir's legal reforms, expressed his philosophy of governance through law and justice rather than arbitrary force. It represented a conscious departure from the martial kingship of his father and established a tradition of legal constitutionalism in Polish political culture.[^54]

> "Justice delayed is justice denied, and a king who does not deliver swift justice is no king at all." - Recorded in chronicles describing Casimir's judicial circuit

This statement, recorded by contemporary chroniclers, reflected Casimir's practice of personally traveling throughout his kingdom to adjudicate disputes and ensure that royal justice was accessible to subjects. It demonstrated his understanding that legitimacy required not just formal authority but active, visible exercise of just governance.[^55]

> "Poland is a haven for Jews, where they may live according to their laws and customs under the protection of our crown." - From Casimir's confirmation of Jewish privileges in 1334

This declaration established Poland as a refuge for Jewish communities facing persecution elsewhere in Europe. Whether motivated by economic pragmatism, humanitarian principle, or both, Casimir's explicit protection of Jewish religious and legal autonomy was exceptional for the medieval period and established a tradition that shaped Polish-Jewish relations for centuries.[^56]

> "Better a secure peace than a glorious defeat." - Casimir's reported response to nobles criticizing the Treaty of Kalisz

This pragmatic statement, recorded in historical accounts of debates over Casimir's diplomatic approach to the Teutonic Knights, captured his preference for practical statecraft over martial glory. It reflected his recognition that Poland's recovery required peace and internal development rather than expensive wars that might restore national pride but exhaust the kingdom's resources.[^57]
