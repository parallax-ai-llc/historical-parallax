## Summary

Olivier Messiaen was a French composer whose unique musical language drew on birdsong, Hindu rhythms, Catholic mysticism, and synesthesia. His Quartet for the End of Time, composed in a POW camp, and Turangalila-Symphonie are landmarks of 20th-century music. As a teacher, he influenced Boulez, Stockhausen, and Xenakis.
