## Overview

The Great Lisbon Earthquake occurred on the morning of All Saints' Day (Nov 1), 1755. It was a "triple disaster": a massive earthquake (est. Mag 8.5-9.0), followed by a tsunami, followed by a firestorm that burned for a week. As Lisbon was the 4th largest city in Europe and a devoutly Catholic capital, the destruction of its churches (packed with worshippers for the holiday) shocked the Western world. It triggered a profound intellectual crisis during the Enlightenment: Voltaire and others asked, "How could a benevolent God allow this?" It also marked the birth of modern disaster management under the Marquis of Pombal.

## The Triple Disaster

### 1. The Quake (9:40 AM)
Three distinct jolts shook the city.
Crucially, it was **All Saints' Day**. Every church was full. The cathedrals collapsed on the congregations.
Since it was a feast day, thousands of candles were lit in homes and altars. When the buildings fell, the candles ignited the debris.

### 2. The Tsunami (10:20 AM)
Survivors rushed to the open safety of the Tagus River docks.
They noticed the water recede, revealing old shipwrecks and lost cargo.
Then, a **20-foot wall of water** roared up the river, engulfing the harbor and the downtown area (Baixa). It killed thousands who had just survived the quake.

### 3. The Firestorm
The fires started by the candles merged into a firestorm that raged for **5 days**.
Temperatures were so high even items 100 feet from the flames ignited.
The royal archives, priceless paintings (Rubens, Titian), and maps of Vasco da Gama's voyages were ash. The history of the Portuguese Empire was erased.

## The Intellectual Shockwave

**Voltaire vs. Rousseau:**
The disaster challenged the philosophy of "Optimism" (that we live in the "best of all possible worlds").
Voltaire wrote *Candide*, mocking the idea that this was "God's Will."
Kant wrote essays trying to explain earthquakes scientifically (shifting subterranean caverns), moving away from supernatural explanations.

## The Dictator of Recovery: Marquis of Pombal

King Joseph I developed a phobia of walled buildings and lived in a tent complex.
Power fell to his Prime Minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo (Marquis of Pombal).
**Immediate Action:**
When asked what to do, he famously replied: **"Bury the dead and heal the living."**
- He deployed troops to hang looters (gallows were set up in high points).
- He forbid anyone from leaving the city (to force labor for rebuilding).
- He ordered bodies loaded onto barges and buried at sea (skipping religious rites to prevent plague).

**Reconstruction (Pombaline Architecture):**
He rebuilt Lisbon with wide avenues and "gaiola" (cage) construction—flexible wooden frames inside masonry walls designed to sway during earthquakes. It was the first **anti-seismic engineering**.
