## Overview

The U-2 incident was a major Cold War diplomatic catastrophe. On May 1, 1960, an American U-2 spy plane piloted by CIA pilot Francis Gary Powers was shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile deep inside Russian territory. The United States initially lied, claiming it was a weather plane that went off course. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev then revealed he had the pilot, the plane wreckage, and the cameras—exposing the U.S. lie. The incident caused the collapse of the Paris Summit between Eisenhower and Khrushchev, freezing the "thaw" in Cold War relations.

## The Trap

### The Cover Story (May 2-5)

**NASA Statement:**
U.S. claimed a high-altitude **weather research aircraft** missing from Turkey had drifted into Soviet airspace after pilot had oxygen trouble.

**The Lie:**
Assumed Powers was dead and plane destroyed (no evidence).

### Khrushchev's Reveal (May 7)

Khrushchev announced to Supreme Soviet:
> "I must tell you a secret... We have the rocket. We have the pilot. We have the films."

**Humiliation:**
Eisenhower caught in blatant lie. Forced to admit he authorized spying. Unprecedented for President.

## The Fallout

### Paris Summit (May 16)

Doomed. Khrushchev demanded apology. Eisenhower refused (said spying was "distasteful necessity"). Khrushchev stormed out. Summit canceled.

### Francis Gary Powers

**Trial (Moscow):**
Show trial. Sentenced to 10 years (3 prison, 7 hard labor).

**Exchange (1962):**
Traded for Soviet spy **Rudolf Abel** at the Glienicke Bridge ("Bridge of Spies") in Berlin. (Depicted in movie *Bridge of Spies*).

**Homecoming:**
Cold reception. CIA suspected he defected or didn't follow destruct orders. Cleared posthumously. Died in helicopter crash 1977 (news reporter).
