## Summary

Don Felipe Agoncillo y Encarnación (May 26, 1859 – September 29, 1941) was the first Filipino diplomat, serving as the Philippine Revolutionary Government's representative to the Treaty of Paris negotiations in 1898. Despite being excluded from the formal proceedings, Agoncillo fought tirelessly to secure international recognition for Philippine independence, even exhausting his personal fortune in the process. His diplomatic missions to Washington and Paris marked the beginning of Filipino advocacy on the world stage, though his efforts ultimately failed to prevent American colonization of the Philippines.

## Early Life and Background

Felipe Agoncillo was born on May 26, 1859, in Taal, Batangas, to Ramón Agoncillo and Gregoria Encarnación.[^1] The Agoncillo family was prosperous and established in Taal, a town known for its affluent principalía class during the Spanish era, with Ramón Agoncillo's household reflecting economic stability typical of landed or merchant elites in Batangas.[^2] Felipe had siblings including older brothers Flaviano and Elias, as well as a sister Juana, among possibly up to eight siblings in total.

Already noticed for his keen intelligence at an early age, Agoncillo later enrolled at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila where he was an honor student who earned high marks.[^3] He later transferred to the Universidad de Santo Tomás, graduating summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Laws in 1879 at the remarkably young age of twenty.[^4] Agoncillo graduated with a Master of Laws from Universidad de Santo Tomás and began his law practice in Manila, quickly establishing a reputation for legal brilliance and social conscience.[^5]

In Taal, Agoncillo as a young lawyer provided free legal assistance to the Batangueños oppressed by landlords or employers, posting an inscription outside his office: "Free legal services to the poor anytime."[^6] His caciquismo—a form of entrenched local patronage and influence—allowed Agoncillo to mobilize political and social agitation against Spanish authorities and friars in Taal, and he became known for defending the poor against the abuses of the Spanish colonial government.[^7]

By age 30, Agoncillo was already a local judge and was married to Marcela Mariño, a daughter of another established family in Taal.[^8] He was appointed as fiscal (public prosecutor) for Batangas province from 1885 to 1890 and again in 1894, positions that reflected his standing in the legal community and his commitment to justice.[^9] His marriage to Marcela Coronel Mariño in 1889 united two of Taal's most prominent families and would prove to be a partnership of remarkable resilience during the turbulent years ahead.[^10]

## Rise to Prominence During the Revolution

Agoncillo's transformation from provincial lawyer to revolutionary figure began in the mid-1890s as anti-Spanish sentiment intensified throughout the archipelago. Agoncillo was accused of being a filibustero or subversive and was about to be arrested when he fled to Hong Kong.[^11] Felipe Agoncillo sailed directly to Yokohama, Japan but briefly stayed and went to Hong Kong where he joined other Filipino exiles who found asylum when the revolution broke out in 1896.[^12]

When her husband was exiled in Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution, Marcela Mariño Agoncillo and the rest of the family joined him and temporarily resided there to avoid the anti-Filipino hostilities of the occupying Spain.[^13] Doña Marcela Mariño de Agoncillo and her daughters stayed in Hong Kong from 1895 to 1906, making their home at Morrison Hill Road in Wanchai a gathering place for Filipino patriots.[^14]

Following the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato on December 14, 1897, which created a truce between Spanish colonial Governor-General Fernando Primo de Rivera and revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo, the revolutionary leadership went into formal exile.[^15] On December 27, 1897, General Emilio Aguinaldo and 25 other revolutionary leaders sailed for Hong Kong from Sual, Pangasinan, on board the steamer Uranus, in compliance with the terms of the Pact.[^16] After the signing of the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, Gen. Aguinaldo joined them in Hong Kong.[^17]

As a family friend and adviser of General Emilio Aguinaldo and General Antonio Luna during the critical times of the revolution, Agoncillo was active in participating during that era especially when he presided over the Hong Kong Junta—a group of Filipino exiles who met to plan for future steps in achieving independence.[^18] The Hong Kong Junta was an organization formed as a revolutionary government in exile by Filipino revolutionaries, headed by Emilio Aguinaldo and including high-level figures in the Philippine revolution against Spanish rule.[^19]

Meetings were initiated in the Agoncillo residence during the critical months of March and April 1898, with Gen. Luna among those in attendance.[^20] When Luna was freed from Spanish imprisonment and came to Hong Kong, he sought the Filipino Revolutionary Junta headed by Felipe Agoncillo.[^21] Upon arriving in Hong Kong, Luna was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo, who thought well of him, entrusting him with twenty revolvers and thirty-five boxes of bullets plus a letter dated July 23, all for Aguinaldo.[^22]

After the signing of the truce, Agoncillo spearheaded the Central Revolutionary Committee and organized the propaganda office for General Aguinaldo's revolutionary government.[^23] Aguinaldo saw "mankind's finest qualities" in Agoncillo and told him his talents would be better served working as ambassador and diplomatic troubleshooter rather than as a foot soldier.[^24] On June 23, 1898, Aguinaldo issued a decree replacing the dictatorial government with a revolutionary government and naming himself as president, setting the stage for Agoncillo's most important mission.[^25]

## Major Achievements: The Diplomatic Mission

Felipe Agoncillo's greatest contribution to Philippine history came when he was assigned to negotiate with foreign countries to secure the independence of the country.[^26] On August 7, 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo entrusted Filipino lawyer Felipe Agoncillo to travel to Washington, D.C., and secure a role in the peace negotiations on behalf of the Philippine Republic.[^27] The Philippine Revolutionary Government commissioned Agoncillo as Minister Plenipotentiary to negotiate treaties with foreign governments, with Sixto Lopez as secretary of the Philippine mission to the United States.[^28]

On August 30, Aguinaldo sent Agoncillo instructions informing him that U.S. Major General Wesley Merritt was leaving Manila to take part in peace negotiations between the United States and Spain in Paris, and that Agoncillo was to proceed as quickly as possible to America, in order to know what takes place.[^29]

### The Washington Mission

McKinley finally got to meet Agoncillo at the White House Cabinet Room in the afternoon of October 1, 1898.[^30] However, President William McKinley's office refused to welcome Agoncillo on the grounds that he did not represent a legitimate government.[^31] McKinley rejected Agoncillo's request for Filipino representation at the peace talks between the U.S. and Spain and invited him to give the U.S. State Department a memorandum summarizing his views.[^32]

He told Agoncillo that the Filipinos could not be represented in the Paris talks because it was something that would not be acceptable to the Spaniards, and that he did not think Agoncillo's command of English was good enough for him to make himself understandable to American negotiators.[^33] Speaking in Spanish, Agoncillo described excesses under Spanish colonial rule and asserted that the American system was the model which the Philippine people would follow when independent, claiming that U.S. emissaries had pledged support for Filipino self-rule.[^34]

### The Paris Conference

Agoncillo then proceeded to Paris, France to present the Philippine cause at the peace conference convened between Spain and the US, where a meeting was to be held to discuss Cuba and the Philippines.[^35] Agoncillo tried to submit a memorandum but again failed—the people behind the meeting did not want to have any official dealings with him.[^36] Felipe Agoncillo, a Filipino lawyer who represented the First Philippine Republic, was denied participation in the negotiation by both the U.S. and Spanish commissioners, who refused to recognize him as a legitimate representative of a sovereign entity.[^37] He was never invited to any of the sessions.[^38]

In his memorandum, Agoncillo stated: "I present to you some considerations bearing upon the relations between the United States and the Philippine Islands" and protested "that the United States has no jurisdiction, natural or acquired, through any of its agencies to adjudicate in any manner upon the rights of my country and people".[^39] For Agoncillo, neither Spain nor America possessed the right to determine what would happen to the Philippines, and he noted that America did not carry out its "promise" to recognize Philippine independence.[^40]

### The Official Protest

The treaty was signed on December 10, 1898, ceding the Philippines to the United States for $20 million.[^41] On December 12, just two days after the treaty was signed, Agoncillo wrote an official protest on behalf of the entire Filipino people.[^42] In his protest, Agoncillo argued that he claimed "the fulfillment of the solemn declaration made by the illustrious William McKinley... that, on going to war, he was not guided by any intention of territorial expansion, but only... the duty of liberating tyrannized people, and the desire to proclaim the unalienable rights of sovereignty of the countries released from the yoke of Spain".[^43]

Agoncillo stated: "in view of the terms of the Article III of the Protocol, the attitude of the American Commissioners, and the imperative necessity of safeguarding the national rights of my country, I take this protest" against the actions and resolutions passed by the Peace Commissioners at Paris.[^44]

### Lobbying Against Ratification

Two days after the signing of the Treaty of Paris, Agoncillo returned to the United States and endeavored to block ratification of the treaty by the US Senate.[^45] He filed a State memorandum to express that Filipinos must be recognized by the United States.[^46] Agoncillo knew that, before the signed Treaty of Paris could take effect, it must be ratified by the US Senate, and he took this little window of time to talk straight to the US Senate that the Philippine Republic was entitled to self-government.[^47]

In his "Memorial to the Senate," Agoncillo argued that Spain had no right to transfer the Philippines to the United States and that the treaty was not binding on the Philippine government.[^48] He submitted a "Memorandum Relative to the Right of the Philippine Republic to Recognition: Accompanying Letter to the Honorable the Secretary of State, of date January 11, 1899."[^49]

Agoncillo saw a glimmer of hope when the Treaty was vigorously opposed in the US Senate during the initial sessions of debates, as many American senators did not favor it, thinking of it as unfair to the Filipinos and a manifestation of imperialism.[^50] However, two days before the Senate voted on the Treaty, the Philippine-American War broke out on February 4, 1899, which apparently influenced the US Congress to vote in favor of the Treaty of Paris two days later.[^51] The Treaty was approved on February 6 by only a single deciding vote.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Felipe Agoncillo is celebrated as the first Filipino diplomat, his mission was marked by significant failures and criticisms that have been documented by historians. President William McKinley's office refused to welcome Agoncillo on the grounds that he did not represent a legitimate government, a rejection that undermined the fundamental premise of his mission.[^53] Agoncillo then sailed to Paris, where he hoped to meet with the commissioners negotiating the terms of the peace treaty, but he was rejected again, leaving him as a mere bystander to decisions that would determine his nation's fate.[^54]

Despite submitting formal protests against the cession of the Philippines to the United States under the Treaty of Paris, signed on December 10, 1898, for $20 million, these efforts yielded no concessions, as the revolutionary government's de facto control was not matched by international acknowledgment or military dominance over the archipelago.[^55] Historians attribute this ineffectiveness to strategic miscalculations, including overreliance on appeals to European powers without sufficient leverage from ongoing revolutionary forces, which allowed U.S. strategic interests in Pacific expansion to prevail unchecked.[^56]

All Philippine efforts were rebuffed, and Agoncillo and the rest of his compatriots were reduced to mere bystanders as Spain ceded the Philippine Islands to the US government for $20 million.[^57] There was at least one instance where Agoncillo's advice was not heeded: When American officials struck a bargain with Aguinaldo for Filipino cooperation in defeating the Spaniards in exchange for help with independence, Agoncillo advised Aguinaldo to put this arrangement in writing, but Aguinaldo countered that it was not necessary because he had confidence in the Americans—a decision that would prove fateful.[^58]

### Personal and Financial Toll

The diplomatic mission took a severe personal toll on Agoncillo. Agoncillo's diplomatic activity incurred expenses that had exhausted his savings, and the costs of traveling and negotiating abroad to pursue the best Filipino interests had forced him to sell his wife's jewelry.[^59] This financial sacrifice highlighted both his commitment to the cause and the lack of adequate support from the revolutionary government, which itself was struggling to maintain its existence.

The Philippine-American War emerged in early 1899 following the United States' annexation of the former Spanish colony of the Philippine Islands under the terms of the December 1898 Treaty of Paris following the Spanish–American War—a conflict that Agoncillo's diplomatic efforts had failed to prevent.[^60] On February 4, 1899, the Philippine–American War began; this turned on approval of the treaty of Paris, marking the definitive failure of Agoncillo's peaceful diplomatic approach.[^61]

Critics have pointed out that Agoncillo's mission may have been doomed from the start, given the overwhelming military and political asymmetry between the nascent Philippine Republic and the United States at the height of its imperial expansion. Some historians suggest that Aguinaldo placed too much faith in American promises and international law at a time when both were subordinate to the realpolitik of great power competition in the Pacific.

## Personal Life and Character

Felipe Agoncillo married Marcela Coronel Mariño in 1889, when both were thirty years old and Felipe was already a judge.[^62] Marcela Coronel Mariño was the daughter of Don Francisco Diokno Mariño and Doña Eugenia Coronel Mariño, a rich family in her hometown of Taal, Batangas.[^63] Together, they had six daughters: Lorenza (Enchang), Gregoria (Goring), Eugenia (Nene), Marcela (Celing), Adela, who died at the age of three, and Maria (Maring), who died on July 6, 1995.[^64]

The Agoncillo marriage was characterized by mutual support and shared sacrifice for the revolutionary cause. When Felipe was exiled to Hong Kong, Marcela and their daughters joined him, making their home a center for Filipino revolutionary activities.[^65] The Agoncillos lived in a house located at Morrison Hill Road in Wanchai, and as the Philippine Revolution wore on, the street became a gathering place of Filipino patriots.[^66]

Besides the legal services rendered by Felipe to the impoverished, Doña Marcela Mariño Agoncillo and her daughters observed every Thursday as a day of charity, when a queue of needy people seeking alms would form in the Agoncillo driveway.[^67] This commitment to social welfare reflected the family's deeply held values of service and compassion.

### Daughters' Achievements

The Agoncillo daughters became accomplished women who contributed significantly to Philippine education and society. Gregoria Mariño Agoncillo was the first Filipina to graduate from Oxford University, an extraordinary achievement in an era when few Filipino women had access to higher education.[^68] Most of her daughters became teachers, and after the graduation of the three elder daughters, they were offered teaching positions.[^69]

Lorenza, the eldest daughter who had assisted her mother in sewing the Filipino flag, dedicated her life to teaching. She taught at the Malate Catholic School for 50 years, a feat duly recognized by the institution through a plaque of merit.[^70] Maria Mariño Agoncillo married Leoncio Noble later in life, with children including Anita Mariño Agoncillo Noble (Miss Philippines 1926), Froila Mariño Agoncillo Noble, and Vicente Mariño Agoncillo Noble.[^71]

### Character and Values

Agoncillo is attributed with saying "Kailangan ang katapatan upang magkaunawaan" (Truth is needed to attain understanding) and "Kailangan ng mga sawimpalad ang pagkalinga ng mga higit na mapalad" (The unfortunate need the care of the more fortunate).[^72] These quotes reveal his core values of truthfulness, justice, and compassion for the less fortunate.

Aguinaldo described Agoncillo as possessing "mankind's finest qualities—intelligence, character, patriotism, capacity for self-sacrifice," suggesting he was "a veritable Colossus."[^73] He was known as one of the most competent advisers of General Emilio Aguinaldo, whose counsel stemmed from his sound judgment and firm grasp of the law.[^74]

## Return to the Philippines and Later Years

On July 15, 1901, after American rule was firmly established in Manila, Felipe Agoncillo returned to the Philippines as a poor man and lived in his house in Malate, Manila together with his family.[^75] Exhausted by years of exile, diplomatic missions, and failed bids for international recognition of Philippine independence, he resettled in his hometown of Taal, Batangas, where he had earlier managed family estates following his parents' deaths.[^76]

After returning to Manila, he resumed his law practice and other business, and took the bar exam in 1905 and passed with a perfect score of 100 percent, an achievement which has remained unmatched until today.[^77] His examination papers have been preserved in the Filipiniana section of the Philippine Library and Museum.[^78] While in Taal, Agoncillo continued his legal services and gave charity to poor and oppressed Filipinos, maintaining the commitment to pro bono work that had characterized his earlier career.[^79]

### Political Service Under American Rule

In 1907, Agoncillo was elected as a delegate to the First Philippine Assembly, representing the first district of Batangas.[^80] Felipe Agoncillo was a member of the Partido Union Nacionalista, one of two nationalist groups that merged on March 12, 1907 to form the Partido Nacionalista, which became one of the two prominent political parties competing in the 1907 Assembly elections.[^81] Prominent personalities in the Revolutionary Government held important posts, including Felipe Agoncillo, who had been Aguinaldo's diplomat in the U.S.[^82] His diplomatic experience and revolutionary credentials made him a significant figure in early Philippine legislative politics.

The Philippine Assembly was formally inaugurated at the Grand Opera House, Manila on October 16, 1907, representing a significant step toward Filipino self-governance under American colonial rule.[^83] Agoncillo's participation in this body demonstrated his pragmatic acceptance of the political realities while continuing to work for Filipino interests within the constraints of the colonial system.

Agoncillo lived the final four decades of his life under American colonial rule, returning to his law practice and continuing to serve his community through legal work, while eventually participating in the limited self-governance allowed under the colonial system.[^84]

## Death and Commemorations

Felipe Agoncillo died on September 29, 1941, at Manila Doctors Hospital, Manila due to pneumonia.[^85] He passed away at the age of 82.[^86] His death occurred amid the early stages of Japanese occupation during World War II, though no direct connection to wartime events is documented in contemporary accounts.[^87] His remains were initially buried at La Loma Cemetery but was later transferred to Santuario del Santo Cristo in San Juan.[^88]

## Legacy and Historical Impact

Agoncillo was the Filipino lawyer representative to the negotiations in Paris that led to the Treaty of Paris (1898), ending the Spanish–American War and achieving him the title of "outstanding first Filipino diplomat."[^89] His greatest contribution to Philippine history was when he was assigned to negotiate with foreign countries to secure the independence of the country, which was considered the most important assignment given by a General.[^90]

Scholars note that his memoranda and protests against the Treaty of Paris (1898) demonstrated intellectual rigor in leveraging legal arguments, even amid asymmetrical power dynamics favoring the United States.[^91] His legacy extends to influencing contemporary strategies, such as the Philippines' successful invocation of international arbitration in the 2016 South China Sea dispute, reflecting enduring lessons in combining national interests with multilateral norms.[^92]

Commemorations affirm his stature, including a historical marker and museum in Taal, Batangas, dedicated in 1955 by the National Historical Institute to honor his contributions as a lawyer, statesman, and patriot.[^93] The municipality of Agoncillo in Batangas is named after him, ensuring that his name remains part of the geographic and cultural landscape of his home province.[^94]

### Museum and Ancestral House

The Agoncillo–Mariño House is an old Spanish Colonial Era house in Taal, Batangas, Philippines, subsequently transformed into a public museum known as the "Museo nina Marcela Mariño and Felipe Agoncillo," now recognized as one of the national shrines overseen by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines.[^95] The house is one of the national shrines under the administration of the NHCP with the purpose of memorializing the contribution of Marcela Mariño de Agoncillo in making the national flag of the Philippines and the deeds and ideals of Felipe Agoncillo y Encarnación, her husband, who came to be known as the "First Filipino Diplomat".[^96]

This historic Spanish Colonial Era residence, constructed by Marcela Agoncillo's grandfather, Don Andrés Mariño, around the 1780s, stands as one of Taal's oldest homes.[^97] On July 6, 1980, Marcela's daughters generously donated the Mariño ancestral house, along with various furnishings and family heirlooms, to the government.[^98] The ancestral house is open to the public without fees and can be found across the street from the Galleria Taal Camera Museum along Agoncillo Street in Taal, Batangas.[^99]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Felipe Agoncillo is widely celebrated in Philippine historiography as a pioneering figure who represented Filipino aspirations for self-determination on the international stage. His title of "outstanding first Filipino diplomat" reflects broad consensus among historians that his mission, though unsuccessful in its immediate objectives, established important precedents for Philippine diplomatic advocacy.[^100]

His writings and diplomatic correspondence are preserved as important historical documents demonstrating the intellectual sophistication of the Philippine revolutionary elite. The fact that his 1905 bar examination papers achieved a perfect score and have been preserved in the Filipiniana section of the Philippine Library testifies to his extraordinary legal acumen.[^101]

Contemporary Filipino nationalism draws inspiration from Agoncillo's willingness to sacrifice his personal fortune for the cause of independence. The fact that he sold his wife's jewelry to continue his diplomatic mission resonates as an example of patriotic dedication.[^102] His provision of free legal services to the poor both before and after his diplomatic career reflects a consistent commitment to social justice that transcends his diplomatic achievements.

Educational institutions and civic organizations regularly cite Agoncillo as an exemplar of principled advocacy and intelligent resistance to colonialism. His sophisticated legal arguments against the Treaty of Paris are studied as early examples of anti-imperialist discourse grounded in international law and moral philosophy.

The connection drawn by scholars between Agoncillo's legal strategies and the Philippines' successful 2016 arbitration case regarding the South China Sea suggests that his approach to combining legal argumentation with appeals to international norms has enduring relevance.[^103] This demonstrates that diplomatic failures in one era can establish precedents and methodologies that bear fruit in later historical periods.

### Negative Views and Criticisms

Critics of Agoncillo's diplomatic mission point to its fundamental ineffectiveness in achieving any tangible results. Despite submitting formal protests and memoranda, these efforts yielded no concessions from either American or European powers.[^104] Historians attribute this ineffectiveness to strategic miscalculations, including overreliance on appeals to European powers without sufficient leverage from ongoing revolutionary forces.[^105]

Some scholars argue that Agoncillo's mission represented a naive faith in international law and great power altruism during an era of rampant imperialism. The fact that he was not even granted formal recognition or allowed to participate in the Paris peace conference demonstrates the complete disregard with which the great powers treated Filipino claims to sovereignty.[^106]

The advice Agoncillo gave to Aguinaldo to put American promises in writing was ignored, suggesting either that his counsel was not valued as highly as later hagiographies claim, or that Aguinaldo's strategic judgment was so flawed that even sound advice could not save the revolutionary cause.[^107] Either interpretation raises questions about the effectiveness of Agoncillo's role as an adviser.

The financial ruin that Agoncillo suffered as a result of his diplomatic mission—exhausting his savings and selling his wife's jewelry—raises questions about whether the revolutionary government adequately supported its diplomatic representatives or whether Agoncillo's mission was a largely personal initiative without proper institutional backing.[^108]

Revisionist historians have questioned whether the veneration of Agoncillo as "first Filipino diplomat" obscures the fundamental futility of his mission and creates a misleading narrative of principled resistance when the historical reality was one of complete Filipino powerlessness in the face of American imperial expansion. From this perspective, celebrating Agoncillo's diplomatic efforts may inadvertently romanticize a catastrophic defeat and obscure the hard lessons about the limits of legal and diplomatic advocacy in the absence of military and economic power.

The fact that Agoncillo later served in the American colonial Philippine Assembly in 1907 is viewed by some critics as evidence that he ultimately accommodated himself to the colonial order he had once opposed, though others view this as pragmatic participation in whatever limited self-governance was available.[^109]
