## Summary

Aleister Crowley was a British occultist, ceremonial magician, and founder of Thelema, a religious philosophy centered on the maxim 'Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.' He claimed to have received The Book of the Law from a supernatural entity in Cairo in 1904. He led the A∴A∴ and Ordo Templi Orientis magical orders. He was one of the most controversial religious figures of the 20th century, dubbed 'the wickedest man in the world' by the British press.
