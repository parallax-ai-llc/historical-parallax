## Summary

Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, better known by his childhood nickname Caligula ("little boots"), served as the third Roman Emperor from 37 to 41 CE.[^1] Born into the prestigious Julio-Claudian dynasty as the son of the celebrated general Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, Caligula initially ruled with promise and popular support before his reign descended into what ancient sources characterize as tyranny, extravagance, and madness.[^2] His brief four-year rule ended violently when he was assassinated by members of the Praetorian Guard in January 41 CE.[^3] Throughout history, Caligula's name has become synonymous with absolute power corrupted, though modern scholars increasingly question whether ancient accounts exaggerated his excesses for political purposes.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Caligula was born on August 31, 12 CE, in Antium, Latium (modern-day Anzio, Italy), into one of Rome's most illustrious families.[^5] His father, Germanicus Caesar, was the nephew and adoptive son of Emperor Tiberius, while his mother, Agrippina the Elder, was the granddaughter of Emperor Augustus himself.[^6] This dual lineage connected Caligula to both the Julian and Claudian branches of Rome's ruling dynasty, positioning him as a potential heir to imperial power from birth.[^7]

The young Gaius earned his famous nickname "Caligula" during his early childhood when he accompanied his father on military campaigns in Germania.[^8] The soldiers dressed him in a miniature military uniform complete with small military boots called "caligae," and the affectionate nickname stuck, though Caligula himself reportedly despised it once he became emperor.[^9] During his father's triumphal procession through Rome, the young boy and his siblings shared their father's chariot, basking in the adulation of the crowds.[^10]

Tragedy struck the family when Germanicus contracted a fatal illness and died in Antioch, Syria, in 19 CE, at the age of 33.[^11] Many Romans believed that Germanicus had been poisoned at the behest of Emperor Tiberius, who supposedly viewed the popular general as a dangerous rival.[^12] After Germanicus's death, Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children, where she became embroiled in a bitter feud with Tiberius that would have devastating consequences for the entire family.[^13]

The emperor's paranoia and political maneuvering led to the systematic destruction of Caligula's family. His mother Agrippina died in exile in 33 CE, while his two elder brothers, Julius Caesar Nero and Drusus Caesar, died in 31 and 23 CE respectively, with their deaths widely attributed to Tiberius's machinations.[^14] Caligula survived as the sole male heir, perhaps because he was younger and therefore seemed less threatening, or perhaps because Tiberius intended to use him as a pawn.[^15]

In 31 CE, when Caligula was just 19 years old, he was summoned to join Emperor Tiberius on the island of Capri, where the emperor had withdrawn from public life.[^16] For the next six years, Caligula lived under the watchful and suspicious gaze of the man who had destroyed his family, learning to mask his true feelings and navigate the treacherous waters of imperial politics.[^17] The Roman historian Suetonius later wrote that even during this period, Caligula's nature could not be entirely suppressed, though he learned to conceal it expertly.[^18]

---

## Rise to Power

When Emperor Tiberius died on March 16, 37 CE, at the age of 77, Caligula's moment finally arrived.[^19] On the very same day, the 24-year-old Caligula was hailed as emperor by members of the Praetorian Guard at Misenum, the Roman naval base near Naples.[^20] His accession was partly orchestrated by Sutorius Macro, the prefect of the Praetorian Guard, who had identified Caligula as the most viable successor.[^21]

Two days after Tiberius's death, the Roman Senate ratified Caligula's leadership, proclaiming him imperator and granting him all the powers of the principate.[^22] The Senate's enthusiasm was genuine—Caligula represented a fresh start after the oppressive final years of Tiberius's reign, and his connection to the beloved Germanicus made him immensely popular with both the military and the Roman people.[^23]

Caligula's path to absolute power was not entirely smooth. Tiberius's will had named both Caligula and his younger cousin Tiberius Gemellus as co-heirs, but the Senate quickly set aside Gemellus's claim, citing his youth.[^24] This decision consolidated all imperial power in Caligula's hands, though it would later have tragic consequences for the young Gemellus.[^25]

The new emperor entered Rome to scenes of wild celebration. The Roman populace, who had loved his father Germanicus, transferred that affection to the son.[^26] Within his first months as emperor, Caligula took several steps that enhanced his popularity and seemed to promise a enlightened reign markedly different from Tiberius's paranoid final years.[^27]

## Major Achievements

The early period of Caligula's reign, roughly the first six months, showed tremendous promise and included several significant achievements that benefited the Roman state and its citizens.[^28] These accomplishments, though often overshadowed by the later controversies of his reign, demonstrate that Caligula possessed both political acumen and genuine concern for certain aspects of governance.[^29]

### Political and Administrative Reforms

One of Caligula's first and most popular acts was to end the treason trials (maiestas charges) that had terrorized the Senate and nobility during Tiberius's reign.[^30] He recalled political exiles, freed prisoners who had been detained on dubious charges, and publicly burned documents related to his mother's and brothers' trials, declaring that he had never read them.[^31] This magnanimous gesture earned him widespread goodwill from the senatorial class, at least initially.[^32]

Caligula introduced what ancient sources describe as democratic elections, restoring a practice that had atrophied under Tiberius.[^33] Unlike his predecessor, he made government finances transparent by publishing public accounts, allowing Roman citizens to see how their taxes were being spent.[^34] He also abolished or reduced certain taxes that had been imposed during Tiberius's reign and were considered burdensome and unpopular among Roman citizens.[^35]

The new emperor gave long overdue bonuses to the Praetorian Guard and the military legions, fulfilling promises made by Tiberius but never honored.[^36] This act secured the loyalty of Rome's military forces and demonstrated Caligula's understanding of where real power resided.[^37]

### Infrastructure and Public Works

Caligula directed considerable attention and resources to ambitious construction projects and public works programs that benefited Rome's ordinary citizens.[^38] These infrastructure initiatives included racetracks, theaters, amphitheaters, and significant improvements to roads and ports throughout the empire.[^39]

Among his most important infrastructure projects were the completion of two major aqueducts—the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus—which had been started under his predecessor.[^40] These aqueducts dramatically enhanced Rome's water supply, providing clean water to its citizens and promoting better sanitation throughout the capital.[^41] The engineering quality of these structures was such that portions remain standing nearly two millennia later.[^42]

Caligula undertook a significant expansion of the port of Ostia, which served as Rome's primary maritime gateway.[^43] The expansion aimed to accommodate larger ships and increase the port's capacity for trade and commerce, particularly the vital grain imports from Egypt.[^44] This was especially important because famine had struck early in his reign, threatening the food supply of the capital.[^45]

He ordered the construction of new roads and channels that ancient sources describe, and which modern engineers acknowledge were impressive achievements even by contemporary standards.[^46] The emperor also funded the repair and restoration of city walls and various temples dedicated to the gods, maintaining Rome's physical and spiritual infrastructure.[^47]

At Pompeii, Caligula built a new amphitheater for public entertainment.[^48] At Boulogne in Gaul, he constructed a lighthouse to guide shipping, demonstrating attention to the needs of the empire's far-flung provinces.[^49]

### Territorial Expansion

In 40 CE, Caligula expanded the Roman Empire by annexing the kingdom of Mauretania in North Africa, though the circumstances were controversial.[^50] He ordered King Ptolemy of Mauretania to Rome and had him executed, allegedly because the king wore a purple cloak (a color reserved for emperors) that attracted admiring crowds.[^51] More likely, political and strategic considerations motivated this decision—the rebellion of Tacfarinas had demonstrated how vulnerable Rome's African provinces were without direct Roman control over Mauretania.[^52]

Following the execution of Ptolemy, Rome divided Mauretania into two provinces: Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania Caesariensis.[^53] Though this annexation triggered a revolt that lasted several years and was not fully suppressed until 44 CE (after Caligula's death), modern historians suggest the expansion was a prudent and ultimately successful response to potential future threats to Roman Africa.[^54]

### Military Affairs

Caligula assembled massive military forces for campaigns in Germania and possibly Britain.[^55] According to Cassius Dio, he concentrated between 200,000 and 250,000 troops for his northern campaigns, an impressive logistical feat.[^56] In late 39 or early 40 CE, he led these forces to the Rhine frontier, possibly intending to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious father Germanicus and attack Germanic tribes.[^57]

While ancient historians portray these military expeditions as failures or farces, modern scholarship suggests Caligula may have had valid political and strategic reasons for his Germanic operations and might even have achieved some success.[^58] The famous incident of Caligula ordering his soldiers to collect seashells on the northern coast—cited by ancient authors as evidence of his madness—may have been misunderstood or deliberately misrepresented by hostile sources.[^59]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

The name Caligula has become virtually synonymous with madness, cruelty, and absolute power corrupted, largely due to the numerous controversies and atrocities attributed to him by ancient historians.[^60] While modern scholars increasingly question the reliability and bias of these accounts, the historical record—as it has come down to us—paints a disturbing picture of a reign that descended into tyranny.[^61]

### The Transformative Illness

The turning point in Caligula's reign occurred in October 37 CE, just months after he assumed power, when he fell severely ill.[^62] Ancient sources describe this as a near-fatal episode, and modern medical researchers have proposed various diagnoses including epilepsy, encephalitis, or some form of brain fever.[^63] According to the Roman historian Suetonius, Caligula had suffered from "the falling sickness" (epilepsy) since childhood during his time on military campaigns.[^64]

One prominent medical theory suggests that Caligula experienced status epilepticus—a prolonged seizure state—that triggered an epileptic psychosis with consequent psychopathic and paranoid personality changes.[^65] Temporal lobe epilepsy, in particular, can induce hypersexuality, religious ecstasy, and erratic behavior, symptoms that align with later descriptions of Caligula's conduct.[^66] Others have proposed encephalitis, though the high mortality rate of this condition in that era makes survival somewhat unlikely.[^67]

After recovering from this illness, ancient sources describe Caligula as a changed man.[^68] He displayed constant mood swings with irascibility or unmotivated laughter, lack of impulse control, perverse behaviors, hypersexuality, and sadism.[^69] Suetonius describes him as a hollow-eyed insomniac who suffered from severe sleep disturbances and could manage no more than three hours of rest per night.[^70] He was reportedly terrified by thunder and loud noises, covering himself or hiding under his bed during storms.[^71]

### Political Murders and Executions

Following his illness, Caligula began systematically eliminating those close to him or those he perceived as threats.[^72] One of his first victims was Tiberius Gemellus, his young cousin and adopted son who had been co-heir in Tiberius's will.[^73] Caligula forced the teenage boy to commit suicide on charges of conspiracy, eliminating the only potential rival to his throne.[^74]

Naevius Sutorius Macro, the Praetorian prefect who had helped engineer Caligula's succession, was rewarded for his loyalty with execution in 38 CE.[^75] Apparently, Macro's usefulness had expired, and Caligula feared he knew too many of the emperor's secrets.[^76]

According to Suetonius, Caligula's cruelties included feeding criminals to wild beasts when cattle became too expensive, and the branding and torture of men of high rank who were sometimes caged or sawn asunder.[^77] Other reported atrocities included death by intermittent beating with chains, cutting out a man's tongue before throwing him to the beasts, and taking pleasure in torture and execution while dining.[^78]

By the end of his reign, more than thirty senators and equestrians had lost their lives, either executed outright or forced to commit suicide.[^79] Whether all these deaths can be attributed solely to Caligula's supposed madness or whether they reflected a brutal but calculated approach to consolidating absolute power remains debated among historians.[^80]

### Sexual Misconduct and Incest Allegations

The ancient sources are replete with accounts of Caligula's sexual depravity, though the extent to which these represent historical fact versus malicious propaganda is impossible to determine.[^81] Suetonius claims that Caligula possessed "enormous" sexual appetites and maintained numerous mistresses and male lovers.[^82]

One of the most shocking allegations was that Caligula committed incest with his sisters, particularly his favorite, Drusilla.[^83] When Drusilla died in 38 CE, Caligula's grief was reportedly extreme—he had her consecrated as Diva Drusilla, making her the first woman in Rome to receive such divine honors.[^84] The nature of their relationship before her death was the subject of scandalous rumors that the sources record with relish.[^85]

Suetonius alleges that Caligula would exhibit his beautiful wife Caesonia naked to his friends and that he freely used his imperial power to arrange sexual encounters with married women, openly mocking their husbands afterward.[^86] Such behavior, if true, represented not just moral depravity but a deliberate assertion of absolute power over the lives and families of Rome's elite.[^87]

### Claims of Divinity and Blasphemy

Perhaps nothing better illustrates Caligula's alleged megalomania than his claims to divinity.[^88] He reportedly set up a temple to his own godhead, installed priests to serve his cult, and demanded to be worshiped as a living god.[^89] Ancient sources describe him conversing with the statue of Jupiter Capitolinus as an equal and inviting the moon goddess to share his bed.[^90]

This claim to divine status created particular problems with Rome's Jewish population. The Jewish historian Philo of Alexandria, who was part of a delegation that visited Caligula in 38 CE, provides a contemporary eyewitness account of the emperor's megalomania in his works "Embassy to Gaius" and "Against Flaccus."[^91] Caligula's order to erect a statue of himself in the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem nearly sparked a major revolt and was only averted by the emperor's death.[^92]

### The Incitatus Incident

One of the most famous stories about Caligula concerns his beloved racehorse Incitatus, which he allegedly planned to make a consul of Rome.[^93] According to Suetonius, Caligula provided the horse with a marble stall, an ivory manger, purple blankets, a jeweled collar, and even a house with servants.[^94]

Ancient sources are clear that Incitatus was never actually appointed consul, though Suetonius writes that Caligula "designated him to the consulship."[^95] Modern scholars, particularly historian Aloys Winterling, argue that this entire episode was an elaborate prank designed not as evidence of madness but as a deliberate insult to the Senate.[^96] The message was clear: the work of senators was so meaningless that even a horse could do it.[^97] This interpretation suggests political theater and mockery rather than insanity.[^98]

### Extravagance and Financial Ruin

Caligula's spending was legendary and ruinous.[^99] He inherited a treasury enriched by Tiberius's frugality but managed to exhaust it within his first year as emperor through extravagant games, gifts, bonuses, and construction projects.[^100] The financial impact on Rome was severe, forcing Caligula to resort to ever more desperate measures to refill the imperial coffers.[^101]

He imposed new taxes, confiscated property from wealthy citizens on trumped-up charges, and even auctioned off gladiatorial equipment and palace furnishings.[^102] These financial pressures increased his unpopularity with Rome's elite and may have contributed to the conspiracy that ultimately killed him.[^103]

### The Bridge of Boats and Military Follies

In 39 CE, Caligula ordered the construction of a temporary floating bridge across the Bay of Baiae, stretching from Baiae to Puteoli, a distance of approximately two miles.[^104] He then rode across it triumphantly, reportedly wearing the breastplate of Alexander the Great.[^105] Ancient historians cited this as evidence of wasteful megalomania, though some modern scholars suggest it may have been connected to military preparations, possibly as a test for a boat bridge across the English Channel for a planned invasion of Britain.[^106]

His military campaigns in Germania and along the northern coast were portrayed by ancient historians as farcical failures.[^107] The story of Caligula "declaring war on the sea" and ordering his troops to collect seashells as "spoils of victory over Neptune" became legendary evidence of his deranged state.[^108] However, modern historians note that the exact nature and purpose of these expeditions cannot be determined from hostile sources, and Caligula may have had valid strategic objectives that were later misrepresented.[^109]

## Personal Life

Caligula's personal life was as tumultuous and controversial as his public reign, marked by multiple marriages, family tragedies, complex relationships, and the psychological scars left by the destruction of his family.[^110]

### Marriages and Wives

Caligula married four times during his short life, with each marriage reflecting different aspects of his character and reign.[^111] His first marriage, to Junia Claudilla, was arranged by Emperor Tiberius in 33 CE when Caligula was just 17 years old.[^112] This marriage ended in tragedy when Junia died in childbirth the following year, along with her baby, leaving the young Caligula bereft.[^113]

His second and third marriages were brief and scandalous. He attended the wedding ceremony of Livia Orestilla to Gaius Piso, but then gave orders that the bride be taken to his own house instead, marrying her himself.[^114] Within a few days, however, he divorced her.[^115] Similarly, he suddenly summoned Lollia Paulina from her province, separated her from her husband, married her, and then divorced her shortly thereafter.[^116] These episodes suggest impulsiveness and a casual disregard for social conventions or others' feelings.[^117]

His fourth and final wife was Milonia Caesonia, whom he married in 39 CE.[^118] Unlike his earlier wives, Caesonia was neither young nor particularly beautiful, and she was already the mother of three daughters from a previous marriage.[^119] Despite this, or perhaps because of it, ancient sources agree that Caligula loved her "passionately and faithfully."[^120] She was pregnant when they married and gave birth to a daughter, Julia Drusilla (named after Caligula's beloved sister), just one month later.[^121]

Suetonius describes how Caligula would parade Caesonia before his friends, sometimes reportedly in a state of undress, proudly showing her off.[^122] Whatever the truth of these accounts, Caesonia remained with Caligula until the end—both she and their infant daughter were brutally murdered by the conspirators immediately after Caligula's assassination in 41 CE.[^123]

### Children

Caligula's only known child was Julia Drusilla, born to Caesonia in 39 CE.[^124] The infant daughter had a tragically short life, caught up in the violence that ended her father's reign.[^125] When the conspirators assassinated Caligula on January 24, 41 CE, they sought out and murdered both Caesonia and the young child, who was barely two years old.[^126] According to accounts, the infant's head was smashed against a wall, ensuring no heir of Caligula's direct line could survive to threaten the new order.[^127]

### Personality and Psychological State

Ancient sources paint a complex psychological portrait of Caligula, though separating fact from hostile propaganda remains challenging.[^128] Before his illness in 37 CE, he seems to have possessed considerable charm and political skill—qualities that helped him survive years under Tiberius's suspicious gaze and win popular support upon becoming emperor.[^129]

After the illness, however, dramatic changes emerged. Suetonius describes severe insomnia, with Caligula sleeping no more than three hours per night and spending his wakeful hours wandering the palace corridors conversing with the moon.[^130] He displayed extreme mood volatility, alternating between fits of laughter and rage with no apparent cause.[^131]

His fear of thunderstorms was reportedly so severe that during storms he would cover his head or hide under furniture.[^132] This phobia, combined with his claims to divine status and conversations with statues of gods, suggests either genuine psychological disturbance or, as some modern historians argue, calculated theater designed to unsettle and dominate those around him.[^133]

### Relationships and Family

The systematic destruction of Caligula's family during Tiberius's reign profoundly shaped his personality and worldview.[^134] By the time he became emperor, his mother and both elder brothers were dead, victims of imperial paranoia.[^135] His three sisters—Agrippina the Younger, Julia Drusilla, and Julia Livilla—represented his closest surviving blood relatives.[^136]

The relationship with his sisters, particularly Drusilla, was the subject of scandalous rumors in ancient sources.[^137] Whether these allegations of incest reflect historical truth or represent the kind of lurid gossip that hostile sources routinely attached to unpopular emperors remains impossible to verify.[^138] What is certain is that Drusilla's death in 38 CE affected Caligula profoundly—her subsequent deification as Diva Drusilla suggests both his grief and his increasing claims to divine status.[^139]

His relationship with the Senate and Rome's aristocracy deteriorated rapidly after his illness, transforming from initial cooperation to contempt and hostility.[^140] Rather than maintaining the careful fiction that Augustus and Tiberius had crafted—that the emperor was merely "first among equals"—Caligula seemed intent on demonstrating the Senate's complete powerlessness.[^141]

---

## Legacy

Caligula's legacy is paradoxical and contested, representing one of history's most dramatic transformations from promise to infamy, and from condemnation to partial rehabilitation by modern scholarship.[^142] His reign has served for nearly two millennia as a cautionary tale about the corrupting influence of absolute power, yet recent historical analysis suggests the traditional narrative may be more complex than previously believed.[^143]

### Immediate Aftermath and Damnatio Memoriae

Following his assassination on January 24, 41 CE, Rome experienced a form of collective relief tinged with chaos.[^144] The Praetorian Guard quickly proclaimed Caligula's uncle Claudius as the new emperor, bypassing any senatorial deliberation.[^145] The Senate, which had suffered terribly under Caligula's reign, briefly debated restoring the Republic but ultimately accepted the reality of military power and imperial succession.[^146]

Caligula was subjected to an unofficial damnatio memoriae—the condemnation of memory.[^147] Of the thousands of images of Caligula in all media that must have existed during his reign, only a small fraction survive today, mostly coins and sculptural portraits.[^148] Many statues were destroyed, defaced, or recarved into likenesses of more acceptable figures.[^149] His name became a byword for tyranny and madness, used by subsequent emperors and their propagandists as an example of how not to rule.[^150]

### Influence on Imperial Precedent

Despite—or perhaps because of—his excesses, Caligula's reign established important precedents for the Roman principate.[^151] His systematic humiliation of the Senate and open assertion of absolute monarchical power made explicit what had been implicit since Augustus.[^152] Future emperors would not need to maintain the polite fiction of sharing power with the Senate; Caligula had torn away that veil.[^153]

His expansion into Mauretania, though completed by his successors, demonstrated Rome's continued appetite for territorial acquisition and established Roman control over North Africa that would last for centuries.[^154] The infrastructure projects he initiated or completed, particularly the aqueducts, served Rome for generations.[^155]

### Literary and Cultural Impact

Caligula's reputation as the archetype of the mad tyrant was firmly established by the ancient sources, particularly Suetonius's lurid biography in "The Twelve Caesars."[^156] This work, written eighty years after Caligula's death, has shaped virtually all subsequent perceptions of the emperor.[^157] The absence of Tacitus's account—lost when portions of his "Annals" were destroyed—means we lack the perspective of Rome's greatest historian on this crucial reign.[^158]

Throughout subsequent history, Caligula has been invoked whenever writers and thinkers wish to illustrate absolute power corrupted. Philosophers, playwrights, and political theorists have used him as a touchstone for discussions of tyranny.[^159] Albert Camus's 1944 play "Caligula" reimagined the emperor as an absurdist philosopher-tyrant confronting the meaninglessness of existence.[^160] The notorious 1979 film "Caligula" presented an extraordinarily graphic (and historically dubious) portrayal that has influenced popular perceptions despite its lack of scholarly rigor.[^161]

### Modern Political Invocations

Caligula's name continues to be invoked in modern political discourse as shorthand for erratic leadership, abuse of power, and executive overreach.[^162] The story of Incitatus, the horse allegedly appointed to high office, regularly resurfaces in political commentary as a metaphor for unqualified appointments.[^163] The phrase "Caligula-like" or "Caligulean" enters public vocabulary during periods when leaders display contempt for institutional norms or appear mentally unstable.[^164]

### Archaeological and Historical Understanding

Modern archaeology and numismatics have provided additional context for understanding Caligula's reign beyond the literary sources.[^165] Analysis of coin issues, inscriptions, and building projects suggests a more complex administrative picture than the ancient historians conveyed.[^166] The successful completion of major infrastructure projects indicates functioning governmental machinery and capable administrators, even if the emperor himself was erratic.[^167]

The survival and continued use of Caligula's aqueducts—the Aqua Claudia and Anio Novus—stand as literal monuments to the productive aspects of his reign.[^168] These engineering marvels, completed during his rule, provided water to Rome for centuries and portions remain standing today.[^169]

### Complex Tapestry

As one modern assessment notes, Caligula's legacy is "a complex tapestry woven with threads of innovation and insanity, grandeur and grotesqueness."[^170] He represents both the promise of charismatic youth brought to power and the dangers inherent in concentrating absolute authority in a single individual without effective checks or balances.[^171] His reign demonstrated that the Roman system of government had become fundamentally dependent on the character and competence of one person, a vulnerability that would plague the empire for centuries.[^172]

---

## Historical Assessment

The historical assessment of Caligula represents one of the most dramatic divergences between ancient sources and modern scholarship in all of Roman history, with contemporary historians increasingly questioning the reliability of traditional narratives.[^173]

### Positive Views

A significant revisionist movement in modern Caligula scholarship has emerged, challenging the traditional portrayal of the emperor as simply a mad tyrant.[^174] These scholars argue that the ancient sources must be understood in their political and literary contexts, recognizing the biases and agendas of their authors.[^175]

#### Source Criticism and Bias

Modern historians emphasize that the primary sources for Caligula's reign—particularly Suetonius and Cassius Dio—were written decades after his death by members of the senatorial class or those writing for senatorial audiences.[^176] Both sources are considered "full of innuendo and anecdotes and not based on primary sources of factual information."[^177] The few surviving sources about Caligula and his four-year reign were mostly written by members of the nobility and Senate, long after the events they describe.[^178]

Some historians note that many later authors who wrote about Caligula were commissioned by subsequent emperors who viewed the fallen emperor negatively and had vested interests in blackening his reputation to legitimize their own rule.[^179] This creates a fundamental reliability problem with the historical record.[^180]

#### Political Context Arguments

Scholars such as Aloys Winterling, whose biography of Caligula represents a significant revisionist work, argue that Caligula was indeed cruel but that his actions were explicable in the light of the political situation of the time and the changing role of the emperor.[^181] According to this interpretation, what ancient sources portray as madness may have been deliberate political theater meant to intimidate Rome's powerful elites while courting popular support.[^182]

Some historians dismiss many of the allegations against Caligula as "misunderstandings, exaggeration, mockery or malicious fantasy."[^183] The humiliation of senators, the Incitatus incident, and other notorious episodes may represent calculated demonstrations of absolute power rather than evidence of insanity.[^184]

#### Administrative Competence

Defenders of Caligula's legacy point to evidence of administrative competence that ancient historians downplayed or ignored.[^185] His early reforms—ending treason trials, recalling exiles, publishing government accounts, and restoring elections—suggest political sophistication.[^186] The successful completion of major infrastructure projects, including complex aqueducts and port expansions, indicates a functioning administration with competent officials.[^187]

Modern commentaries increasingly seek to explain Caligula's position, personality, and historical context, with some historians arguing that many of his actions, such as building projects and public works, were actually popular with ordinary Romans even if they offended the senatorial elite.[^188]

#### Medical and Psychological Perspectives

Some scholars approach Caligula's behavioral changes from medical and psychological perspectives, suggesting that if he did suffer from epilepsy, encephalitis, or another neurological condition, his later actions might reflect illness rather than inherent depravity.[^189] This shifts the historical assessment from moral condemnation to a more nuanced understanding of a potentially incapacitated leader.[^190]

Recent neuropsychiatric analyses, including studies published in medical journals, have attempted to provide clinical explanations for Caligula's behavior, suggesting temporal lobe epilepsy or other conditions that could account for the personality changes ancient sources describe.[^191]

#### Accomplishments Reconsidered

Revisionist historians emphasize that during Caligula's brief reign, he worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate—a goal that many subsequent emperors pursued and that arguably reflected the empire's political evolution.[^192] The annexation of Mauretania, whatever its immediate motivations, proved strategically sound and secured Rome's North African provinces.[^193]

### Negative Views

Despite revisionist arguments, many historians maintain that even allowing for source bias and exaggeration, Caligula's reign represented a genuine period of terror and misrule that inflicted real suffering on Rome.[^194]

#### Core of Historical Truth

Scholars who take a more traditional view argue that while individual anecdotes in Suetonius and other sources may be embellished or fabricated, the overall pattern they describe likely reflects historical reality.[^195] As one assessment notes, "even allowing for exaggeration, there is no doubt that he never hesitated to torment or kill the common people, the ruling elite, or even his own family."[^196]

The fact that Caligula was assassinated by a broad conspiracy involving Praetorian officers, senators, and courtiers suggests widespread hatred and fear that cannot be explained away as mere senatorial bias.[^197] The murder of his wife and infant daughter in the immediate aftermath of his assassination indicates the conspirators believed his bloodline posed a continuing threat.[^198]

#### Senate Relations

Historians critical of Caligula emphasize that his relationship with the Senate deteriorated from cooperation to open hostility, resulting in the execution or forced suicide of more than thirty senators and equestrians.[^199] His 39 CE speech attacking the Senate as traitors to his family marked a point of no return in emperor-Senate relations.[^200]

Unlike Augustus and Tiberius, who maintained at least the fiction of shared governance, Caligula seemed intent on demonstrating the Senate's complete powerlessness and ruling as an absolute monarch.[^201] This represented not political sophistication but destructive autocracy that destabilized the governmental system.[^202]

#### Financial Irresponsibility

Critics point to Caligula's financial management as objectively catastrophic—he inherited a full treasury from Tiberius's frugality and exhausted it within a year through extravagant spending.[^203] The resulting fiscal crisis forced him to resort to confiscations, arbitrary taxation, and other desperate measures that alienated wealthy Romans and damaged the imperial economy.[^204]

#### Religious and Cultural Offenses

Caligula's claims to divinity and demands for worship went far beyond acceptable Roman norms, even for emperors.[^205] His order to place a statue of himself in the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem nearly sparked a major revolt and demonstrated reckless disregard for provincial sensibilities and religious pluralism that had been cornerstones of Roman success.[^206]

#### Limited Timeframe for Atrocities

Some historians note that if Caligula's worst atrocities occurred primarily in the last year of his reign (as some evidence suggests), this concentrated period of terror may actually support arguments about illness-induced behavioral changes rather than mitigating his culpability.[^207]

### Scholarly Consensus

The current scholarly consensus represents a middle position: acknowledging that ancient sources are biased and sensationalized while maintaining that Caligula's reign was genuinely problematic.[^208] Most historians now separate the more sensational anecdotes from administrative and archaeological evidence, viewing his excesses in the context of an emperor who both pursued public benefactions and alienated powerful social groups.[^209]

Modern interpretations increasingly present Caligula's reign as "a cautionary tale about the dangers of absolute power and the fragility of political legitimacy" rather than simply a story of individual madness.[^210] The debate over whether Caligula truly suffered from mental illness or whether his behavior reflected deliberate political theater remains unresolved, with evidence supporting both interpretations.[^211]

For more balanced scholarly assessments, historians cite Barrett (1989), Hurley (1993), and Antonelli (2001) as providing more nuanced perspectives than the ancient sources, while Winterling's work represents the most comprehensive recent attempt at rehabilitation.[^212]

## Famous Quotes

> "Utinam populus Romanus unam cervicem haberet!" (Would that the Roman people had but one neck!) - Attributed by Suetonius in "The Twelve Caesars," reflecting Caligula's alleged contempt for the Roman populace and desire for absolute control.[^213]

> "Oderint, dum metuant." (Let them hate me, so that they will but fear me.) - Though this quote originated with the tragic playwright Accius, Suetonius reports that Caligula frequently repeated it as a personal motto, revealing his philosophy of governance through fear rather than affection.[^214]

> "Remember that I have the right to do anything to anybody." - Reported by ancient sources as Caligula's declaration of absolute power, embodying his rejection of legal and moral constraints on imperial authority.[^215]

**Note on Quotes:** Many quotes widely attributed to Caligula online actually derive from the 1979 film "Caligula" or Albert Camus's 1944 play "Caligula" rather than authentic historical sources. Virtually all genuine information about the historical Caligula's words comes from hostile sources written decades after his death, making attribution uncertain.[^216]
