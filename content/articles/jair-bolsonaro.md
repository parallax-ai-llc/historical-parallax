## Summary

Jair Messias Bolsonaro served as the 38th President of Brazil from 2019 to 2023, representing a radical shift in Brazilian politics toward right-wing populism. A former military officer and long-time congressman, Bolsonaro rose to power on an anti-establishment platform emphasizing law and order, economic liberalization, and conservative social values. His presidency was marked by controversial environmental policies, a contentious response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and frequent clashes with democratic institutions. After losing the 2022 presidential election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília, leading to ongoing legal challenges that have profoundly shaped his legacy.

## Early Life and Background

Jair Messias Bolsonaro was born on March 21, 1955, in Glicério, a small town in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. He was the fourth of six children born to Percy Geraldo Bolsonaro and Olinda Bonturi Bolsonaro, a family of Italian descent with modest means. His father worked as a dentist and prospector, and the family moved frequently during Bolsonaro's childhood, eventually settling in Eldorado, a town in the Ribeira Valley region of São Paulo state.[^1]

Growing up in rural Brazil during the military dictatorship era (1964-1985), Bolsonaro developed early admiration for the armed forces and their role in what he viewed as maintaining order in Brazilian society. This formative period under authoritarian rule would profoundly influence his political ideology throughout his life. Despite the family's financial struggles, Bolsonaro was determined to pursue a military career, seeing it as a path to social advancement and national service.[^2]

In 1973, at age 18, Bolsonaro entered the Preparatory School of the Brazilian Army (EsPCEx) in Campinas, São Paulo. He subsequently attended the Military Academy of Agulhas Negras (AMAN), one of Brazil's most prestigious military institutions, graduating in 1977 as an artillery officer. During his military training, Bolsonaro internalized the institutional values of hierarchy, discipline, and anti-communism that characterized the Brazilian armed forces during the Cold War period.[^3]

Bolsonaro's early military career included service as a parachutist in the 8th Parachute Field Artillery Group and the 9th Field Artillery Group. However, his time in the military was not without controversy. In 1986, he published an article in the magazine Veja criticizing low military salaries and advocating for better pay conditions for soldiers. This act of public dissent against military leadership resulted in his arrest and brief imprisonment, though he was later acquitted. The incident foreshadowed his willingness to challenge established authority when he disagreed with it.[^4]

---

## Rise to Power

Bolsonaro's transition from military officer to politician began in 1988 when he was elected as a city councilor in Rio de Janeiro, representing the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). This marked the beginning of a political career that would span more than three decades and see him switch party affiliations multiple times. In 1990, he was elected to the federal Chamber of Deputies, representing Rio de Janeiro state, a position he would hold continuously for seven consecutive terms until his election as president.[^5]

During his early years in Congress, Bolsonaro remained a relatively marginal figure, known primarily for his provocative statements and his advocacy for military and police interests. He consistently defended Brazil's military dictatorship, arguing that it had been a period of order and economic growth, and openly criticized the transition to democracy. His rhetoric often included controversial statements about human rights, minority groups, and political opponents that generated media attention but limited his appeal to mainstream voters.[^6]

Bolsonaro's political fortunes began to change in the 2010s as Brazil experienced a series of crises that eroded public confidence in traditional political institutions. The massive corruption scandal known as Operation Car Wash (Operação Lava Jato), which implicated numerous politicians across the political spectrum, created widespread disillusionment with the political establishment. Bolsonaro, who had remained outside the main political power structures and had a reputation for personal integrity regarding corruption, positioned himself as an outsider untainted by the scandal.[^7]

The impeachment of President Dilma Rousseff in 2016 and the subsequent imprisonment of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2018 created a political vacuum that Bolsonaro was positioned to fill. He skillfully exploited growing public concerns about violent crime, economic stagnation, and what conservative Brazilians perceived as moral decay. His campaign embraced social media, particularly WhatsApp and Facebook, to bypass traditional media outlets he viewed as hostile and to spread his message directly to supporters.[^8]

During the 2018 presidential campaign, Bolsonaro survived an assassination attempt when he was stabbed during a campaign rally in Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, in September 2018. The attack, which required emergency surgery and weeks of recovery, paradoxically boosted his campaign by generating sympathy and allowing him to avoid traditional debates while maintaining media visibility. His simple slogan "Brazil Above Everything, God Above Everyone" resonated with voters seeking change, and his promise to combat crime, corruption, and leftist ideology appealed to a broad coalition of conservatives, evangelicals, security forces, and business interests.[^9]

In October 2018, Bolsonaro won the presidential election with 55.13% of the vote in the runoff against Fernando Haddad of the Workers' Party (PT), winning in 17 of Brazil's 27 states. His victory represented a dramatic realignment of Brazilian politics and was seen as part of a global wave of right-wing populist movements gaining power in various democracies.[^10]

## Major Achievements

Upon taking office in January 2019, Bolsonaro appointed Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-trained economist, as Minister of Economy, signaling a commitment to liberal economic reforms. The Bolsonaro administration successfully pushed through significant pension reform legislation in 2019, addressing Brazil's unsustainable social security system that had threatened the country's fiscal stability. The reform raised the minimum retirement age and changed benefit calculation formulas, measures that previous governments had attempted but failed to implement due to political opposition.[^11]

The pension reform was considered Bolsonaro's most significant legislative achievement, with economists estimating it would save the government approximately 800 billion reais (about $200 billion USD) over ten years. This reform helped restore some international investor confidence in Brazil's fiscal management and was praised by international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund.[^12]

Bolsonaro's government also pursued extensive deregulation and privatization initiatives aimed at reducing bureaucracy and stimulating economic growth. The administration sold off state assets, reduced business licensing requirements, and simplified tax procedures for small businesses. These measures were welcomed by the business community and contributed to a modest economic recovery in 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic struck.[^13]

In foreign policy, Bolsonaro strengthened Brazil's relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump, with whom he shared ideological affinities. He moved Brazil's embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, aligned Brazilian foreign policy more closely with U.S. positions at international forums, and emphasized bilateral trade relationships over multilateral institutions. This represented a significant shift from Brazil's traditionally independent and multipolar foreign policy approach.[^14]

Bolsonaro also expanded gun ownership rights in Brazil through a series of executive decrees that loosened restrictions on firearm purchases and possession. For his supporters, particularly in rural areas and among those concerned about crime, this represented a fulfillment of campaign promises and an affirmation of individual liberty and self-defense rights.[^15]

His administration implemented the "Médicos pelo Brasil" (Doctors for Brazil) program, intended to replace the Cuban doctors who had left the country's "Mais Médicos" program after Bolsonaro criticized Cuba's human rights record. While controversial, the program aimed to address healthcare shortages in remote and underserved areas of Brazil.[^16]

Bolsonaro also advocated for infrastructure development, particularly in the Amazon region, arguing that economic development and poverty reduction required expanding transportation networks and agricultural production. His government pursued projects to pave roads, build bridges, and improve port facilities, though these initiatives often conflicted with environmental protection concerns.[^17]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Bolsonaro's presidency was marked by numerous controversies that generated intense domestic and international criticism. His handling of the COVID-19 pandemic became perhaps the most significant source of criticism, as Brazil recorded one of the world's highest death tolls from the virus. Bolsonaro consistently downplayed the severity of COVID-19, referring to it as a "little flu," opposed lockdown measures implemented by state governors, promoted unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine, and delayed vaccine procurement. A Brazilian Senate investigation concluded that his administration's response constituted crimes against humanity, though Bolsonaro was not criminally charged while in office.[^18]

Environmental policy under Bolsonaro drew severe international condemnation as deforestation in the Amazon rainforest reached its highest levels in over a decade. His administration weakened environmental enforcement agencies, reduced protected areas, and encouraged agricultural expansion into the Amazon. Satellite data showed deforestation increased by approximately 75% during his presidency compared to the previous four years. International leaders, environmental organizations, and Indigenous rights advocates accused Bolsonaro of enabling environmental destruction with global climate implications.[^19]

Bolsonaro faced repeated accusations of undermining democratic institutions and norms. He regularly attacked the Brazilian press, calling journalists "scum" and threatening to revoke broadcasting licenses of outlets critical of his government. He questioned the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system without evidence, raising fears he might not accept electoral defeat. His rhetoric often expressed nostalgia for Brazil's military dictatorship and made statements suggesting support for authoritarian governance.[^20]

His treatment of Indigenous peoples and their land rights generated widespread criticism from human rights organizations. Bolsonaro's government dramatically reduced the demarcation of Indigenous territories, proposed opening Indigenous lands to mining and agricultural development, and employed rhetoric that Indigenous rights advocates described as genocidal. The invasion of Indigenous lands by illegal miners and loggers increased significantly during his presidency.[^21]

Bolsonaro made numerous statements widely condemned as racist, sexist, and homophobic throughout his career. He told a female congresswoman she was "not worth raping," made disparaging comments about Black and Indigenous communities, and stated he would rather have a dead son than a gay son. These statements generated protests from civil rights organizations and contributed to his polarizing public image.[^22]

His government's relationship with Congress was frequently chaotic, characterized by political maneuvering that critics characterized as corrupt. Bolsonaro distributed government positions and budget allocations to congressional allies in exchange for support, a practice known in Brazil as "toma lá, dá cá" (give and take). This contradicted his campaign promises to end traditional political corruption.[^23]

The January 8, 2023 riots in Brasília, where thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed and vandalized the presidential palace, Congress, and Supreme Court buildings, represented a dramatic culmination of his refusal to accept electoral defeat. While Bolsonaro was in Florida at the time and condemned the violence, critics argued his months of questioning election integrity had directly incited the attack, drawing comparisons to the January 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol attack.[^24]

## Personal Life

Jair Bolsonaro has been married three times and has five children. His first marriage was to Rogéria Nantes Braga in 1978, with whom he had three sons: Flávio, Carlos, and Eduardo. The marriage ended in divorce in 1997. In the same year, he married Ana Cristina Valle, with whom he had a daughter, but this marriage also ended in divorce in 2007. In 2013, he married Michelle de Paula Firmo Reinaldo, with whom he has a daughter, Laura, born in 2011.[^25]

All three of Bolsonaro's sons from his first marriage followed him into politics. Flávio Bolsonaro serves as a senator for Rio de Janeiro, Carlos Bolsonaro is a city councilman in Rio de Janeiro, and Eduardo Bolsonaro serves as a federal deputy. This family political dynasty became a central feature of Bolsonaro's political operation, with his sons serving as key advisors and political strategists, particularly in social media strategy.[^26]

Bolsonaro identifies as a devout Catholic and maintains close relationships with evangelical Protestant leaders, who formed a crucial part of his political base. His rhetoric frequently incorporated religious references, and he positioned himself as a defender of "traditional Christian values" against what he characterized as leftist secularism and moral relativism. His third wife, Michelle, an evangelical Christian, became an influential figure in his administration and political movement.[^27]

Those who know Bolsonaro describe him as personally austere and disciplined, traits he attributes to his military background. He has cultivated an image of simplicity, avoiding the trappings of elite Brazilian politics and emphasizing his middle-class origins. Unlike many Brazilian politicians, he built a political career without accumulating significant personal wealth, living in a modest apartment in Rio de Janeiro even as president.[^28]

Bolsonaro's health has been a recurring concern throughout his political career. Beyond the 2018 stabbing, which resulted in long-term digestive complications requiring multiple surgeries, he contracted COVID-19 in July 2020 despite his dismissive attitude toward the virus. His health issues occasionally limited his political activities but also generated sympathy among supporters who viewed him as having sacrificed his wellbeing for Brazil.[^29]

His communication style is notably unfiltered and confrontational, characterized by crude language and provocative statements that frequently generated controversy. Supporters viewed this as authentic and refreshing compared to the careful political correctness of traditional politicians, while critics saw it as unpresidential and dangerous. His extensive use of social media, particularly Twitter (before being banned) and Facebook, allowed him to communicate directly with millions of followers.[^30]

## Legacy

Jair Bolsonaro's legacy remains deeply contested and will likely be debated by historians for decades. His presidency fundamentally altered Brazilian politics, demonstrating the viability of right-wing populism in Latin America's largest democracy and breaking the Workers' Party's dominance of national politics. He mobilized previously politically disengaged conservatives, evangelical Christians, and security forces into an active political coalition that will remain influential in Brazilian politics regardless of Bolsonaro's personal political future.[^31]

The institutional damage to Brazilian democracy during Bolsonaro's presidency represents a significant aspect of his legacy. His persistent attacks on the electoral system, the Supreme Court, the press, and democratic norms eroded public confidence in institutions essential to democratic governance. The January 8, 2023 riots demonstrated the violent potential of his rhetoric and his movement's willingness to reject electoral outcomes. Brazil's democratic resilience was tested in ways not seen since the return to civilian rule in 1985.[^32]

Environmentally, Bolsonaro's legacy is catastrophic according to climate scientists and environmentalists. The acceleration of Amazon deforestation during his presidency may have pushed the rainforest closer to an irreversible tipping point with global climate implications. The weakening of environmental protection mechanisms and the emboldening of illegal loggers, miners, and ranchers will have effects lasting far beyond his presidency. Indigenous communities lost protections and territory in ways that may be difficult to reverse.[^33]

Economically, Bolsonaro's legacy is mixed. The pension reform addressed a critical fiscal challenge and demonstrated that politically difficult reforms were possible. However, his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to Brazil's severe economic contraction in 2020, and his administration failed to implement broader tax reforms or sustainable economic growth strategies. Brazil's economy remained stagnant throughout most of his presidency, with persistent poverty and inequality.[^34]

In foreign policy, Bolsonaro reoriented Brazil away from multilateralism and South American regional leadership toward closer alignment with the United States and Israel. This represented a significant departure from decades of Brazilian foreign policy consensus and damaged Brazil's international standing, particularly regarding environmental and human rights issues. Future Brazilian governments will need to rebuild diplomatic relationships strained during his presidency.[^35]

Bolsonaro's legal troubles after leaving office, including investigations into his role in the January 8 riots, his questioning of electoral integrity, allegations of illegal sale of gifts received from foreign governments, and potential criminal liability for his COVID-19 response, will shape his legacy. In 2023, Brazil's electoral court barred him from running for office until 2030 due to his abuse of power in questioning the electoral system, effectively ending his immediate political career though not his influence over Brazilian politics.[^36]

His impact on Brazilian political culture includes the normalization of aggressive rhetoric, the deepening of political polarization, and the integration of conspiracy theories and disinformation into mainstream political discourse. The division of Brazilian society into intensely loyal "Bolsonaristas" and fierce opponents reflects a polarization that will likely persist for years.[^37]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Bolsonaro's supporters and some scholars argue that he represented a necessary corrective to years of left-wing governance that had led Brazil into economic crisis and institutional corruption. They contend that the Workers' Party governments of Lula and Rousseff had created an unsustainable fiscal situation, enabled massive corruption schemes, and promoted cultural values at odds with Brazil's conservative majority. From this perspective, Bolsonaro's election reflected legitimate democratic expression of popular will for change.[^38]

Conservative economists praise Bolsonaro's appointment of Paulo Guedes and the successful pension reform as addressing fundamental economic problems that previous governments had lacked the political courage to tackle. They argue that his deregulation and privatization initiatives, while incomplete, moved Brazil toward a more market-oriented economy that could eventually generate sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Business leaders appreciated his government's reduction of bureaucratic barriers and pro-enterprise rhetoric.[^39]

Supporters emphasize that Bolsonaro fulfilled campaign promises regarding gun rights, conservative judicial appointments, and opposition to what they characterize as cultural Marxism. They argue he gave voice to millions of Brazilians who felt ignored by coastal elites and mainstream media, and that his unpolished communication style represented authentic connection with ordinary people rather than calculated political messaging.[^40]

Some international relations scholars note that Bolsonaro's realignment of Brazilian foreign policy toward the United States reflected a legitimate strategic choice in a changing global environment, and that his criticism of multilateral institutions reflected genuine concerns about their effectiveness. His supporters argue that standing with Israel and opposing authoritarian leftist regimes in Venezuela, Cuba, and Nicaragua represented principled defense of democratic values.[^41]

Agricultural interests and rural communities appreciate Bolsonaro's support for expanding agricultural production, reducing environmental restrictions they viewed as excessive, and defending rural land rights. They argue that his environmental policies balanced conservation with legitimate economic development needs of poor regions and that international criticism reflected neocolonial attitudes toward Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon.[^42]

Defenders also note that Bolsonaro faced an unprecedented global pandemic with no clear policy consensus, and that his emphasis on economic continuity reflected legitimate concerns about the devastating economic and social consequences of lockdowns, particularly for poor Brazilians dependent on informal employment. They argue that in retrospect, his skepticism about some pandemic measures appears less unreasonable than portrayed at the time.[^43]

### Negative Views

Critics across the political spectrum view Bolsonaro's presidency as a dangerous period for Brazilian democracy characterized by authoritarian tendencies, institutional degradation, and the normalization of extremist rhetoric. Political scientists point to his persistent attacks on electoral integrity, his threats against the Supreme Court and Congress, and his tolerance of political violence as fundamentally incompatible with democratic governance. They argue he deliberately eroded institutional checks on executive power.[^44]

Public health experts and epidemiologists condemn Bolsonaro's COVID-19 response as one of the worst globally, arguing that his denial of the pandemic's severity, his opposition to scientifically-supported mitigation measures, and his promotion of ineffective treatments resulted in hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths. The congressional investigation into his pandemic response documented systemic failures that critics argue constituted crimes against humanity.[^45]

Environmental scientists and climate experts describe Bolsonaro's environmental legacy as catastrophic, arguing that his encouragement of Amazon destruction accelerated climate change with global implications, threatened biodiversity essential to human survival, and violated Brazil's international commitments under the Paris Agreement. They contend that his administration's weakening of environmental protection agencies and encouragement of illegal activities in protected areas represents an environmental crime of historic proportions.[^46]

Human rights organizations consistently condemned Bolsonaro's rhetoric and policies regarding women, LGBTQ+ individuals, Black Brazilians, and Indigenous peoples. They document how his presidency emboldened discrimination and violence against marginalized groups, reversed decades of progress in civil rights, and violated Brazil's constitutional commitments to equality. Indigenous rights advocates particularly emphasize the existential threat his policies posed to Indigenous communities.[^47]

Journalists and press freedom organizations characterize Bolsonaro's treatment of the media as an authoritarian attack on a fundamental democratic institution. His consistent verbal attacks on journalists, threats against media outlets, dissemination of disinformation, and attempts to undermine independent journalism created a hostile environment for press freedom. Brazil's ranking in global press freedom indices declined significantly during his presidency.[^48]

International relations experts argue that Bolsonaro's foreign policy damaged Brazil's global standing and influence, particularly his alignment with Trump, his environmental record, and his abandonment of multilateralism. They contend that his approach isolated Brazil internationally, damaged relationships with European partners and neighboring countries, and squandered Brazil's potential leadership role in addressing global challenges.[^49]

Economists critical of Bolsonaro note that despite the pension reform, his administration failed to implement comprehensive tax reform, sustained growth strategies, or meaningful poverty reduction. They point to weak GDP growth, persistent unemployment, and increased hunger and poverty during his presidency as evidence of economic failure. His management of the pandemic economy, they argue, exacerbated Brazil's economic problems.[^50]
