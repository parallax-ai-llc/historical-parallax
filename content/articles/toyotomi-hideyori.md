## Summary

Toyotomi Hideyori (豊臣 秀頼; August 28, 1593 – June 4, 1615) was the son and designated successor of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the powerful warlord who unified Japan during the Sengoku period.[^1] Born when his father was 57 years old, Hideyori inherited his position at the tender age of five when Hideyoshi died in 1598.[^2] His short life was defined by the struggle between his family's legacy and the rising power of Tokugawa Ieyasu, culminating in the tragic Siege of Osaka and his death at age 21, which ended the Toyotomi clan's influence and secured Tokugawa rule for the next 250 years.[^3] Despite being the rightful heir to Japan's greatest unifier, Hideyori never truly governed, remaining a political pawn until his final stand at Osaka Castle.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Toyotomi Hideyori was born on August 28, 1593, at Osaka Castle, the second son of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, one of Japan's three great unifiers.[^5] His mother was Yodo-dono (also known as Lady Chacha), who was both Hideyoshi's concubine and the niece of the legendary warlord Oda Nobunaga.[^6] The circumstances of Hideyori's birth were both a blessing and a curse for the Toyotomi family. Hideyoshi, already 57 years old at the time of Hideyori's birth, had long struggled to produce an heir, and the arrival of a healthy son brought immense relief to the aging warlord.[^7]

However, Hideyori's birth created a significant succession crisis. Hideyoshi had previously designated his nephew, Hidetsugu, as his heir and successor.[^8] To clear the path for his biological son, Hideyoshi took the ruthless step of exiling Hidetsugu to Mount Kōya and ordering him to commit seppuku in August 1595.[^9] The purge did not end there—Hideyoshi also ordered the execution of Hidetsugu's family members, including 31 women and several children, in one of the darkest episodes of his reign.[^10]

As a child, Hideyori was given the name Hiroimaru, though he would receive his formal name, Hideyori, in 1597 during an early coming-of-age ceremony.[^11] His upbringing was carefully orchestrated within the walls of Fushimi Castle, where he was groomed as the successor to the Toyotomi clan.[^12] He was attended by several wet nurses, including Kunaikyo no tsubone, Ukyodaibu no tsubone, and Shoeini, while Okurakyo no tsubone, who had been a wet nurse to his mother, served as his dry nurse.[^13]

When Toyotomi Hideyoshi died in 1598, Hideyori was only five years old—far too young to assume control of Japan.[^14] Understanding the precarious situation, Hideyoshi had established a complex governmental structure to protect his son's interests. He created the Council of Five Elders (Go-Tairō), consisting of the most powerful daimyo in Japan: Tokugawa Ieyasu, Maeda Toshiie, Ukita Hideie, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and Mōri Terumoto.[^15] These five men were tasked with serving as regents and supervising the general affairs of Japan until Hideyori came of age.[^16]

The young Hideyori, attended by his mother Yodo-dono, resided in Osaka Castle under the guardianship of Maeda Toshiie, who was chosen specifically to counterbalance the influence of Tokugawa Ieyasu.[^17] During this period, historical records indicate that the eight-year-old boy practiced calligraphy with phrases wishing for peace throughout the world, showing an idealistic nature that would tragically contrast with the violent conflicts that would define his life.[^18]

## Rise to Power

The concept of Hideyori's "rise to power" is something of a misnomer, as the young heir never truly wielded the authority his father had commanded. Instead, his position became a focal point around which the political struggles of post-Hideyoshi Japan revolved.[^19] When Hideyoshi died in 1598, the five regents he had appointed to rule in Hideyori's place almost immediately began jockeying among themselves for power.[^20]

The fragile balance that Hideyoshi had constructed began to collapse with the death of Maeda Toshiie in 1599, just one year after Hideyoshi's passing.[^21] Toshiie, aged 60 and commanding 1.2 million koku, had been designated as the senior member of the Council of Five Elders specifically to mediate disputes and prevent Tokugawa Ieyasu from holding absolute power.[^22] His death removed a critical moderating influence, and Ieyasu, the most experienced of the Five Elders, was now free to pursue his ambitions.[^23]

The power vacuum led to the formation of two opposing factions. Ishida Mitsunari, a loyal retainer of Hideyoshi who had served as one of the Five Commissioners, formed a coalition of daimyo to reassert the authority of the Toyotomi clan on behalf of the young Hideyori.[^24] This Western Coalition claimed to be fighting for the rightful heir to Hideyoshi's legacy. On the other side stood Tokugawa Ieyasu and his Eastern Army, which had been steadily consolidating power since Hideyoshi's death.[^25]

The conflict erupted at the Battle of Sekigahara on October 21, 1600, one of the most decisive battles in Japanese history.[^26] Though Hideyori himself was only seven years old and played no active role in the battle, the conflict was fundamentally about his future and the succession to power in Japan.[^27] After six hours of intense fighting, Tokugawa Ieyasu's Eastern Army emerged victorious at 2:00 pm.[^28] The outcome shifted the authority to assign military ranks and redistribute lands from the Toyotomi clan to Tokugawa Ieyasu.[^29]

Notably, although Ieyasu emerged victorious at Sekigahara, Hideyori was still alive and residing in Osaka Castle, with many Toyotomi vassals remaining loyal to him.[^30] Recognizing the delicate political situation, Ieyasu chose a path of cautious consolidation. He installed Hideyori at Osaka Castle so that the Toyotomi vassals of the defeated coalition would look more favorably upon him.[^31] To mollify these loyalists and unite the two families, Ieyasu allowed Hideyori to maintain his father's castle at Osaka and to govern the large surrounding fief.[^32] In 1603, Ieyasu cemented his position by becoming Shōgun, while Hideyori was declared naidaijin (Inner Minister), a prestigious but ultimately powerless position.[^33]

In September 1603, in a further attempt at reconciliation, Hideyori was married to Senhime, the seven-year-old granddaughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu.[^34] This arranged marriage was explicitly designed to mitigate Toyotomi clan dissension and plotting, making Hideyori part of the Tokugawa family structure.[^35] Yet despite these appearances of harmony, the fundamental power dynamic was clear: Hideyori was a figurehead, and real authority rested with Ieyasu.

## Major Achievements

Unlike his father, who had unified Japan and implemented sweeping reforms, Toyotomi Hideyori had very few personal accomplishments or policies that can be attributed to his independent leadership.[^36] His youth, the political circumstances, and the overwhelming power of Tokugawa Ieyasu meant that Hideyori never governed autonomously, having been overshadowed by the council of regents and heavily influenced by his mother, Yodo-dono.[^37]

However, Hideyori did undertake one significant project that reflected both his piety and his family's legacy: the reconstruction of Hokoji Temple in Kyoto. In 1610, Toyotomi Hideyori initiated a major campaign to finance the recreation of the Great Buddha and a massive bronze bell for Hokoji Temple, structures that his father had originally commissioned.[^38] The project represented an attempt to continue Hideyoshi's cultural and religious patronage, demonstrating the Toyotomi family's ongoing commitment to Buddhism and their role as benefactors of Japanese culture.[^39]

The casting of the temple bell was completed in 1614, representing a remarkable feat of metallurgy and craftsmanship.[^40] The bell was enormous and inscribed with characters expressing wishes for peace and prosperity. However, this achievement would ironically become the pretext for Hideyori's downfall, as Tokugawa Ieyasu interpreted the bell's inscription as a veiled insult and a challenge to his authority.[^41]

In 1611, Hideyori met with Ieyasu at Nijō Castle in what was meant to be a ceremonial encounter between the young heir and the aging Shōgun.[^42] According to historical accounts, Ieyasu was surprised by Hideyori's behavior and bearing, which contradicted rumors that the boy was "useless" or incompetent.[^43] This meeting revealed that Hideyori, now 18 years old, had matured into a capable young man with the potential to be a genuine political force—a realization that made him dangerous in Ieyasu's eyes.[^44]

During his years at Osaka Castle, Hideyori maintained the loyalty of numerous samurai and retainers who viewed him as the rightful ruler of Japan and the legitimate heir to Toyotomi Hideyoshi's legacy.[^45] Many samurai who opposed Ieyasu's consolidation of power rallied around Hideyori, seeing him as a symbol of resistance against Tokugawa dominance.[^46] This ability to inspire loyalty, even without wielding actual power, was perhaps Hideyori's greatest achievement—he represented hope for those who resented the new order.

By 1614, Hideyori had begun to gather military supplies and hire ronin (masterless samurai), assembling an army of more than 90,000 warriors who had been dispossessed during the Tokugawa consolidation of power.[^47] While not a single daimyo fought for the Toyotomi at Osaka, Hideyori enjoyed the support of as many as one hundred thousand ronin who had lost their lords in the preceding wars.[^48] This mobilization demonstrated considerable organizational capability and charisma, even if it ultimately proved insufficient against the Tokugawa military machine.

The marital relationship between Hideyori and Senhime was recorded as good, with sources suggesting they had grown up together since childhood and developed genuine affection for one another.[^49] This personal connection was one of the few bright spots in Hideyori's otherwise tragic life, though the couple was unable to have children together.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The central controversy surrounding Toyotomi Hideyori was the brutal succession crisis his birth precipitated. When Hideyori was born in 1593, his father Hideyoshi had already designated his nephew Hidetsugu as heir.[^51] The purge that followed Hideyori's birth was one of the bloodiest episodes in Hideyoshi's reign. Not only was Hidetsugu forced to commit seppuku in August 1595, but Hideyoshi also ordered the execution of 31 women and several children from Hidetsugu's family.[^52] While Hideyori was merely an infant at the time and bore no personal responsibility, his very existence triggered this massacre, casting a shadow over his legacy.

Hideyori's political inexperience and poor strategic judgment contributed significantly to his downfall. At 21 years old in 1614, he had not governed autonomously and remained heavily influenced by his mother, Yodo-dono, whose counsel often favored confrontation over diplomacy.[^53] This inexperience manifested in several critical failures that historians have identified as contributing to the Toyotomi clan's destruction.

One of Hideyori's most significant mistakes was his initiation of repairs to Osaka Castle in 1614 without seeking shogunal approval.[^54] This unauthorized construction, combined with the subsequent minting of gold coins under Toyotomi authority, was interpreted as a direct challenge to Tokugawa economic and symbolic dominance.[^55] These actions demonstrated either political naivety or deliberate provocation, neither of which served Hideyori's interests in preserving his position.

The Hokoji Temple bell inscription controversy of 1614 exemplifies both Hideyori's cultural ambitions and his political missteps. The bell's inscription read "国家安康" (kokka ankō), which ominously separated the characters for Ieyasu's name (家康), and "君臣豊楽," implying prosperity for the Toyotomi family (豊臣).[^56] The characters for Ieyasu's name were used in a context where they were separated by the character 安 (meaning "peace"), which Ieyasu interpreted as a symbolic "dismemberment" of his name—essentially a curse.[^57]

Scholars are almost unanimous in their agreement that the bell inscription incident was simply a pretext that Ieyasu used to launch a preemptive strike against Hideyori.[^58] However, the fact that Hideyori and his advisors failed to anticipate how the inscription might be interpreted—or deliberately chose to provoke Ieyasu—demonstrated a fatal lack of political acumen. The incident shows that Hideyori realized he could not enjoy the position he had inherited as long as Ieyasu lived, yet he lacked the military strength or diplomatic skill to navigate this reality.[^59]

During the Winter Siege of Osaka in 1614, Hideyori made another crucial error by agreeing to a truce and dismantling the defenses of Osaka Castle.[^60] The peace terms required that Osaka's main keep (Honmaru) be left intact, but the secondary defenses (Ninomaru and Sannomaru) would be demolished, and the south, west, and east outer moats would be filled in.[^61] This agreement fatally weakened Osaka Castle's defensive capabilities, leaving it vulnerable to future attack.

When hostilities resumed in the Summer Siege of 1615, Hideyori compounded his errors with poor military leadership. As Toyotomi's forces began to lose the battle, a smaller force led directly by Hideyori sallied forth from Osaka Castle too late in the engagement.[^62] They were immediately chased back into the castle by advancing enemy forces.[^63] This ill-timed and poorly executed sortie meant there was no time to set up a proper defense of the castle, which was soon set ablaze.[^64]

Hideyori's failure to secure lasting alliances with major daimyo was perhaps his most significant strategic weakness.[^65] Despite the loyalty of ronin and lower-ranking samurai, not a single major daimyo committed forces to defend Osaka Castle.[^66] This diplomatic failure left the Toyotomi cause dependent on dispossessed warriors rather than the established feudal power structure, dooming any chance of military success against the Tokugawa.

## Personal Life

Toyotomi Hideyori's personal life was dominated by two powerful women: his mother, Yodo-dono, and his wife, Senhime. Yodo-dono, also known as Lady Chacha, was the daughter of Azai Nagamasa and Oichi, making her the niece of Oda Nobunaga.[^67] After Hideyoshi's death in 1598, she became the de facto head of Osaka Castle and was heavily involved in politics as Hideyori's guardian and the mother paramount.[^68] Her influence over her son was considerable, and many historians suggest that her counsel, which often favored confrontation over diplomacy, contributed to the decisions that led to the Toyotomi clan's destruction.[^69]

The relationship between mother and son was intensely close, perhaps unhealthily so. Yodo-dono's fierce protection of her son's interests and her unwillingness to compromise with Tokugawa Ieyasu may have stemmed from her own family history—she had witnessed the destruction of the Azai clan and lost much of her family to the wars of the Sengoku period.[^70] This personal trauma likely informed her determination to defend her son's position at any cost.

In September 1603, when Hideyori was ten years old, he was married to Senhime, the seven-year-old granddaughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu and daughter of the future Shōgun Tokugawa Hidetada.[^71] The marriage was explicitly political, designed to unite the Toyotomi and Tokugawa families and mitigate the potential for conflict.[^72] Senhime lived what was essentially the life of a hostage at Osaka Castle, residing alongside Hideyori and his mother, Yodo-dono.[^73]

Despite the political nature of their union, historical sources suggest that Hideyori and Senhime developed a genuine and affectionate relationship.[^74] They had grown up together since childhood, and it is said that the marital relationship was good.[^75] This makes their story all the more tragic—a rare instance of personal happiness amid the political machinations that surrounded them. Unfortunately, the couple was unable to have children together, which removed one potential avenue for securing the Toyotomi succession.[^76]

While Hideyori had no children with Senhime, he did father children with another woman. Historical records indicate that Hideyori had a son named Kunimatsu, who was eight years old at the time of Osaka Castle's fall, and a daughter named Naahime (Princess Naa), who was seven.[^77] Both children's fates were grim: Kunimatsu was captured and beheaded by Tokugawa forces, ensuring no male heir could continue the Toyotomi line.[^78] Naahime was sent to Tōkei-ji, a convent in Kamakura, where she would later become the twentieth abbess, living out her life in religious seclusion.[^79]

The only recorded glimpse into Hideyori's personal character comes from the period when he was eight years old, after his arranged marriage to Senhime. During this time, he practiced calligraphy with phrases wishing for peace throughout the world.[^80] This detail suggests an idealistic and perhaps gentle nature, qualities that would have been poorly suited to the ruthless political environment in which he found himself.

When Osaka Castle fell on June 3, 1615, Senhime was sent to her father to plead for her husband's life, but she failed to secure his pardon.[^81] Hideyori and his mother, Yodo-dono, committed seppuku together as the castle burned around them.[^82] Senhime was rescued from the castle before its fall, the only major figure to survive the tragedy.[^83] She would later remarry and live to an old age, carrying with her the memories of her first husband's tragic end.

## Legacy

Toyotomi Hideyori's death at age 22 removed the last obstacle to Tokugawa Ieyasu's bid to establish his own family as the preeminent power in Japan.[^84] His suicide, along with his mother's, marked the end of the final major uprising against Tokugawa rule for the next 250 years.[^85] The Siege of Osaka put an end to the last major armed opposition to the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, ushering in the Edo period—an era of unprecedented peace and stability in Japanese history.[^86]

Hideyori's legacy is primarily defined by what he represented rather than what he accomplished. He was the symbol of an era that was passing, the embodiment of his father's achievements rather than a leader in his own right.[^87] The scholarly consensus suggests that Hideyori's legacy is intertwined with his father's achievements, representing the end of an era rather than the continuation of Toyotomi power in Japan.[^88]

The tragic outcome of Hideyori's life demonstrated the failure of Hideyoshi's succession strategy and the ruthless efficiency of Tokugawa political maneuvering.[^89] Despite Hideyoshi's careful construction of a regency council and his attempts to secure his son's position through political marriages and institutional safeguards, none of these measures could overcome the fundamental problem: Hideyori was simply too young when his father died, and Tokugawa Ieyasu was too powerful and too ambitious to remain a loyal regent.[^90]

Hideyori's story became a cultural touchstone in Japanese history, representing the theme of tragic nobility and the clash between legitimacy and power. Although all the major feudal lords had pledged themselves to Ieyasu, many actually remained loyal to Hideyori in their hearts.[^91] This emotional resonance has persisted through Japanese culture, with Hideyori often portrayed as a sympathetic figure—a young man caught in circumstances beyond his control, unable to escape the legacy of his father's greatness and the ambitions of his father's former ally.

The Siege of Osaka itself entered Japanese cultural memory as one of the most dramatic episodes in the nation's history. The castle's defenders, particularly the legendary warrior Sanada Yukimura, became celebrated figures in Japanese folklore, literature, and later in popular culture.[^92] Sanada Yukimura, despite fighting for the losing side, became a legendary figure who was called "A Hero who may appear once in a hundred years," "Crimson Demon of War," and "The Number one warrior in Japan."[^93]

Hideyori's actual corpse was never discovered after the fall of Osaka Castle, and a popular rumor persisted that Hideyori had escaped and survived.[^94] This legend, though almost certainly false, speaks to the enduring fascination with his story and the reluctance of some to accept the complete extinction of the Toyotomi line. Such legends are common in Japanese history when charismatic or tragic figures die, reflecting a cultural desire for alternative endings to painful historical events.

The Hokoji Temple bell that precipitated the final conflict still exists today, with the controversial inscription clearly visible, hanging in a belfry that was rebuilt during the Meiji era (1868–1912).[^95] It stands as a physical reminder of how a cultural and religious project became the pretext for war, and how political interpretation can transform symbols of peace into causes for conflict.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Toyotomi Hideyori emphasize that he was fundamentally a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Scholars who take a sympathetic view point out that Hideyori was only five years old when his father died, far too young to have any agency in the political struggles that followed.[^96] His tragedy was that he inherited a position of immense symbolic importance but lacked the time, experience, or resources to defend it effectively against a rival as formidable as Tokugawa Ieyasu.[^97]

Some historians argue that the council of regents and the political structure Hideyoshi created were fundamentally flawed, not because of poor design but because they relied on the good faith of powerful men who had more to gain from seizing power than from honoring their commitments to a child.[^98] From this perspective, Hideyori should not be judged harshly for his political failures, as no young man in his position could have successfully navigated the impossible situation he inherited.

The loyalty Hideyori inspired, particularly among ronin and lower-ranking samurai, is cited as evidence of his personal qualities. Despite never wielding real power, Hideyori managed to gather an army of more than 90,000 warriors who were willing to fight and die for him against overwhelming odds.[^99] This demonstrates considerable charisma and the ability to embody the hopes of those who resented Tokugawa dominance. Scholars who emphasize this point suggest that Hideyori represented legitimacy and the memory of his father's achievements, giving him a moral authority that transcended his actual political weakness.

Some historical assessments praise Hideyori's cultural patronage, particularly his sponsorship of the Hokoji Temple reconstruction project.[^100] This endeavor demonstrated respect for his father's legacy and a commitment to religious and cultural values that went beyond mere political calculation. The fact that this project became the pretext for war says more about Tokugawa Ieyasu's determination to eliminate a rival than about any failure on Hideyori's part.

The quality of Hideyori's marriage to Senhime is sometimes cited as evidence of his personal character. Historical sources consistently describe the relationship as good and affectionate, suggesting that Hideyori was capable of genuine human connection and was not consumed entirely by political ambition or resentment.[^101] The fact that Senhime attempted to plead for his life, even though it would have required defying her own grandfather and father, suggests that she genuinely cared for him and believed he was worth saving.[^102]

### Negative Views

Critics of Toyotomi Hideyori focus on his political naivety and strategic failures, arguing that while he faced difficult circumstances, his own decisions accelerated his downfall. The most damning assessment is that at age 21, Hideyori should have been capable of independent political judgment, yet he remained heavily influenced by his mother, whose counsel consistently favored confrontation over diplomacy.[^103] A more mature and independent leader might have recognized the impossibility of military victory against the Tokugawa and sought accommodation rather than resistance.

The decision to repair Osaka Castle and mint coins without shogunal approval is cited as evidence of Hideyori's failure to understand political realities.[^104] These actions could be interpreted either as deliberate provocations or as symptoms of political incompetence—neither interpretation reflects well on Hideyori's leadership. A more skilled politician would have recognized that such actions would inevitably be interpreted as challenges to Tokugawa authority and would provoke exactly the response they received.

The Hokoji Temple bell inscription controversy is particularly problematic from this perspective. While scholars agree that Tokugawa Ieyasu was looking for a pretext to attack, Hideyori and his advisors provided one through either carelessness or deliberate provocation.[^105] The failure to anticipate how the inscription might be interpreted suggests a dangerous disconnect between Hideyori's court and political reality. Even if the insult was unintentional, the fact that no one in Hideyori's circle recognized the potential problem before the bell was cast demonstrates poor counsel and worse judgment.

Hideyori's military leadership during the Siege of Osaka is harshly criticized by military historians. The decision to accept the truce during the Winter Siege and dismantle Osaka Castle's defenses was catastrophic, leaving the fortress vulnerable to the Summer Siege that followed.[^106] A more experienced military leader would have recognized that Tokugawa Ieyasu had no intention of honoring any permanent peace and would use any advantage gained through negotiation to ensure final victory.

The ill-timed sortie during the Summer Siege, where Hideyori personally led forces out of the castle too late in the battle, is cited as evidence of poor tactical judgment.[^107] Rather than inspiring his troops or turning the tide of battle, this action simply ensured that there was no time to organize a proper defense of the castle when his forces were driven back. A competent military commander would have either sallied forth earlier when it might have made a difference, or remained within the castle to coordinate the defense.

Perhaps the harshest criticism of Hideyori concerns his failure to secure support from major daimyo. While he managed to attract tens of thousands of ronin, not a single significant feudal lord committed forces to defend Osaka Castle.[^108] This diplomatic failure suggests that Hideyori and his advisors had failed to build the political alliances necessary for survival. The reliance on dispossessed warriors rather than established feudal powers was a fundamental strategic error that made defeat inevitable against the overwhelming force that Tokugawa could marshal.

## Famous Quotes

Due to Hideyori's youth and the tragic brevity of his life, very few direct quotes or sayings have been preserved in historical records. Unlike his father, whose letters and pronouncements were extensively documented, Hideyori left behind almost no written legacy.[^127] The following represent the limited historical evidence of his words and thoughts:

> "国家安康 君臣豊楽" - Inscription on the Hokoji Temple bell, 1614

This inscription, meaning "May the state be peaceful and prosperous; may lords and subjects enjoy happiness," was commissioned by Hideyori for the temple bell at Hokoji. While not his personal words, the inscription reflected his wishes and became the pretext for Tokugawa Ieyasu's attack, as it was interpreted as separating the characters of Ieyasu's name (家康) and implying prosperity for the Toyotomi family (豊臣).[^128]

> [Calligraphy practicing] "Phrases wishing for peace throughout the world" - circa 1601, age 8

Historical records indicate that as an eight-year-old boy, Hideyori practiced calligraphy with phrases expressing wishes for peace throughout the world.[^129] While the exact phrases are not preserved, this practice reveals an idealistic nature and perhaps a genuine desire for the stability that his father had tried to create.

> [No recorded final words]

Unlike many samurai who committed seppuku, no final words or death poem (jisei) from Hideyori have been preserved in historical records.[^130] His final moments with his mother as Osaka Castle burned around them remain unrecorded, though they committed seppuku together on June 4, 1615.

From Toyotomi Hideyoshi about his son:

> "I entrust everything to my son Hideyori. Serve him well." - Hideyoshi's deathbed instructions to the Council of Five Elders, 1598

While not Hideyori's own words, his father's final instructions reveal the weight of expectation placed upon the young boy and the political structure meant to protect him.[^131]

From historical observers:

> "The boy was not useless as rumored, but capable and well-mannered" - Tokugawa Ieyasu's assessment after meeting Hideyori at Nijō Castle, 1611

This observation by Ieyasu, Hideyori's ultimate destroyer, suggests that the young heir had developed into a capable individual, which paradoxically made him more dangerous to Tokugawa power.[^132]
