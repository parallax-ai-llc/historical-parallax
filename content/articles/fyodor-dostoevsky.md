## Summary

Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821-1881) was a Russian novelist, philosopher, and essayist whose works explored the darkest recesses of the human psyche. His major novels—*Crime and Punishment*, *The Brothers Karamazov*, *The Idiot*, *Demons*—delve into guilt, redemption, free will, suffering, and the existence of God with unprecedented psychological depth. A literary titan who influenced existentialism, psychoanalysis, and 20th-century literature, Dostoevsky's own life was marked by suffering: mock execution, Siberian exile, epilepsy, gambling addiction, and poverty. Yet through his characters—murderers, saints, intellectuals, suffering women—he created a profound vision of human nature in conflict with itself.
