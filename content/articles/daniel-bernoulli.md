## Summary

Daniel Bernoulli was a Swiss mathematician and physicist who made fundamental contributions to fluid dynamics, probability, and statistics. His work 'Hydrodynamica' introduced what became known as Bernoulli's principle, relating fluid speed to pressure. This principle is fundamental to understanding flight, blood flow, and many engineering applications. He also pioneered the kinetic theory of gases and expected utility theory in economics.
