## Summary

Mother Teresa, born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu, was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun who dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor in Calcutta, India. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950, an organization that grew to operate in over 130 countries, providing care for the dying, orphaned, and diseased. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, she became a global symbol of compassionate service and religious devotion. However, her legacy has been contested, with critics questioning her medical practices, financial transparency, and theological motivations. She was canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta by the Catholic Church in 2016, nearly two decades after her death.

## Early Life and Background

Mother Teresa was born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu on August 26, 1910, in Skopje, in what is now North Macedonia, to an ethnic Albanian family from Kosovo. Her father, Nikollë Bojaxhiu, was a successful merchant and political activist involved in Albanian nationalism, while her mother, Dranafile Bojaxhiu, was a devout Catholic who instilled deep religious values in her children[^1]. The family was relatively prosperous and closely involved in their local Catholic parish.

Tragedy struck when Anjezë was only eight years old: her father died suddenly in 1919, leaving the family in financial difficulties. Her mother took on embroidery and cloth-selling work to support the family, while maintaining a strong emphasis on charity and helping the poor in their community[^2]. This early exposure to both hardship and charitable work would profoundly influence Anjezë's future path.

From a young age, Anjezë was fascinated by stories of missionaries, particularly those working in India. She was an active member of her parish and the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin Mary, where she learned about missionary work in Bengal[^3]. By age 12, she felt a calling to religious life, and by 18, she had decided to become a missionary nun.

In 1928, at age 18, Anjezë left home to join the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish community of nuns with missions in India. She never saw her mother or sister again[^4]. She traveled first to Ireland to learn English at the Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Dublin, before being sent to India in 1929. Upon arriving in Calcutta, she began her novitiate in Darjeeling, at the foot of the Himalayas, where she learned Bengali and taught at the Loreto school[^5].

She took her first religious vows in May 1931, choosing the name "Teresa" after Thérèse de Lisieux, the patron saint of missionaries. She taught history and geography at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta, for nearly twenty years, becoming the school's principal in 1944[^6]. Though comfortable in the convent, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty she witnessed outside its walls.

## Rise to Power

Mother Teresa's transformation from a cloistered teacher to a global humanitarian icon began with what she described as her "call within a call." On September 10, 1946, during a train journey from Calcutta to Darjeeling for her annual retreat, she experienced what she believed was a divine directive to leave the convent and serve the poorest of the poor while living among them[^7]. This date became known in the Missionaries of Charity as "Inspiration Day."

It took nearly two years of petitions and negotiations with church authorities before she received permission to leave the Loreto order and pursue her new calling. In August 1948, she received Vatican permission to live as an independent nun[^8]. She exchanged her traditional Loreto habit for a simple white cotton sari with a blue border, similar to what the poorest women in Calcutta wore, which would become her iconic garment.

Mother Teresa began her work with no institutional support or funding. She underwent a brief medical training course with the American Medical Missionary Sisters in Patna before returning to Calcutta and moving into the slums[^9]. She started an open-air school for children in the Motijhil area, teaching basic hygiene and literacy. She initially worked alone, relying on her meager savings and begging for supplies.

Her former students from Loreto gradually began joining her, and in 1950, she received canonical recognition for her new congregation, the Missionaries of Charity[^10]. The organization's mission was "to care for the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone."

A major breakthrough came in 1952 when she opened the Kalighat Home for the Dying, a hospice in a former temple of Kali in Calcutta. She convinced city officials to give her this space to care for people dying on the streets, offering them dignity in their final hours[^11]. This facility, called "Nirmal Hriday" (Pure Heart), became the flagship of her mission and attracted significant media attention.

The 1960s saw rapid expansion of the Missionaries of Charity. In 1965, Pope Paul VI granted Mother Teresa permission to expand the order outside India, and the first international house opened in Venezuela[^12]. By 1968, the organization had established foundations in Rome, Tanzania, and Austria. Mother Teresa's work began attracting international recognition, with media coverage presenting her as a living saint ministering to the world's most destitute.

Malcolm Muggeridge's 1969 BBC documentary "Something Beautiful for God" and his subsequent 1971 book of the same name transformed Mother Teresa into a global celebrity[^13]. The documentary's mystical portrayal and what Muggeridge claimed was a "miraculous" brightening of film in dark conditions (later explained as the result of new film technology) created an aura of divine favor around her work. This publicity brought an explosion of donations, volunteers, and worldwide attention.

## Major Achievements

Mother Teresa's most enduring achievement was the creation and expansion of the Missionaries of Charity into a worldwide organization. From its humble beginnings with just 13 members in 1950, the congregation grew to over 4,500 sisters operating 610 missions in 123 countries by the time of her death[^14]. These facilities included hospices, orphanages, soup kitchens, schools, and centers for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis.

The establishment of Nirmal Hriday (Home for the Dying Destitute) in 1952 represented a revolutionary approach to end-of-life care for the poorest members of society. Mother Teresa and her sisters would pick up dying people from the streets of Calcutta and bring them to the hospice, where they received basic care, food, and a clean place to die with dignity[^15]. The concept was that every person, regardless of their religion or background, deserved to die "within sight of a loving face." Over the decades, tens of thousands of dying destitute individuals received care in this facility.

In 1955, Mother Teresa opened Shishu Bhavan, the first Missionaries of Charity children's home, which cared for orphans and abandoned children[^16]. The organization would go on to establish numerous orphanages worldwide, facilitating thousands of adoptions and providing care for children with disabilities, malnutrition, and terminal illnesses.

Her work with leprosy patients was particularly noteworthy. In 1957, she opened her first leprosy center, and in the 1960s, she established several mobile leprosy clinics throughout Calcutta[^17]. At a time when leprosy patients faced extreme social stigma and were often abandoned by their families, Mother Teresa insisted on their inherent dignity and worked to provide them with medical care, rehabilitation, and employment opportunities. She founded Shanti Nagar (Town of Peace), a leprosy colony where patients could live and work.

Mother Teresa received numerous awards and honors recognizing her humanitarian work. In 1962, she received the Padma Shri from the Indian government, followed by the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in 1969[^18]. The Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 brought her work to unprecedented global attention. In her acceptance speech, she controversially used the platform to denounce abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace" and declined the traditional Nobel banquet, asking that the $192,000 budget be given to the poor in India instead[^19].

She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from the United States in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997[^20]. She was made an honorary citizen of the United States, one of only eight people ever to receive this honor during their lifetime. In 1996, she was granted honorary citizenship of her birthplace, now known as Skopje, North Macedonia.

Beyond material achievements, Mother Teresa transformed global perceptions of charity and service. She popularized the concept that caring for the dying and destitute was valuable work in itself, not merely a means to conversion or a stepping stone to social reform[^21]. Her famous saying, "We can do no great things, only small things with great love," became a mantra for countless volunteers and charitable organizations worldwide.

The Missionaries of Charity expanded beyond the original congregation of sisters to include the Missionaries of Charity Brothers (founded 1963), the Contemplative Brothers and Sisters (founded 1976), and the Missionaries of Charity Fathers (founded 1984)[^22]. Additionally, she established the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa and the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, lay movements that allowed people worldwide to participate in her mission.

Her influence extended into unexpected areas. She mediated conflicts, visiting war zones in Lebanon in 1982 to rescue 37 mentally handicapped children trapped in a hospital during the Siege of Beirut[^23]. She negotiated a temporary ceasefire between the Israeli army and Palestinian guerrillas, allowing her to cross the militarized border to rescue the children.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her saintly reputation, Mother Teresa faced substantial criticism from medical professionals, journalists, and secular thinkers. The most systematic critique came from Christopher Hitchens, who challenged her in his 1995 book "The Missionary Position" and the documentary "Hell's Angel," arguing that she was "a fanatic, a fundamentalist, and a fraud"[^24].

Medical professionals who volunteered at Missionaries of Charity facilities reported serious concerns about the quality of care provided. Dr. Robin Fox, editor of the British medical journal The Lancet, visited the Home for the Dying in 1994 and noted that sisters with minimal medical training made decisions about pain relief, antibiotics, and diagnosis[^25]. He observed that suffering patients were not given adequate pain medication, that needles were rinsed in cold water and reused without proper sterilization, and that patients with different diseases were not separated, risking cross-contamination.

Critics argued that Mother Teresa's facilities emphasized spiritual care and "beautiful death" over medical treatment and cure. Despite receiving millions of dollars in donations, her hospices lacked basic medical equipment, proper diagnostic tools, and modern pain management protocols[^26]. Former volunteers reported that treatable patients sometimes died from lack of proper medical intervention, and that the organization's emphasis was on baptizing the dying rather than treating the curable.

Mother Teresa's staunch opposition to contraception and abortion, even in cases of rape, incest, or threat to the mother's life, drew criticism from reproductive rights advocates[^27]. She used her global platform to advocate for these positions, stating at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C. in 1994 that abortion was "the greatest destroyer of peace today" and that artificial contraception was morally equivalent to abortion.

The financial opacity of the Missionaries of Charity became a significant point of contention. Despite receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in donations from around the world, the organization refused to publish financial statements or undergo independent audits[^28]. Critics questioned where the money went, noting the continuing primitive conditions in her facilities despite vast resources. German magazine Stern published an investigation in 1998 estimating that only a fraction of donations went to the poor, with most being sent to the Vatican Bank.

Mother Teresa's relationships with wealthy donors of questionable character raised ethical concerns. She accepted over $1 million from Charles Keating, the notorious American banker who was convicted of fraud, racketeering, and conspiracy in the savings and loan scandal that cost American taxpayers billions[^29]. When prosecutors asked her to return the money from Keating's victims, she never responded. She also accepted donations from the Duvalier family dictatorship in Haiti, praising them publicly despite their brutal human rights record.

Her political interventions sometimes contradicted her stated apolitical stance. She publicly opposed divorce legislation in Ireland and Italy, lobbied against reproductive rights globally, and maintained cordial relationships with authoritarian leaders while positioning herself as a voice for the voiceless[^30]. Critics argued this represented selective political engagement that aligned with conservative Catholic doctrine while ignoring structural injustices.

A controversial 2013 study published in Studies in Religion/Sciences Religieuses by researchers from the University of Montreal analyzed published writings about Mother Teresa and concluded that her hallowed image was largely constructed through effective media relations rather than documented results[^31]. The study noted that "her rather dubious way of caring for the sick, her questionable political contacts, her suspicious management of the enormous sums of money she received, and her overly dogmatic views regarding abortion, contraception, and divorce" were insufficiently examined due to her media-cultivated image.

Some critics from within India argued that Mother Teresa perpetuated negative stereotypes about India and Calcutta specifically, presenting the city primarily as a place of death and misery to Western audiences while ignoring the resilience, culture, and social welfare systems already present[^32]. Aroup Chatterjee, a Calcutta-born physician, spent years researching Mother Teresa and argued in his book "Mother Teresa: The Untold Story" that she exaggerated the extent of poverty and suffering in Calcutta to attract donations.

The miracle required for her beatification was disputed by medical professionals. Monica Besra, an Indian woman, claimed she was cured of a stomach tumor through Mother Teresa's intercession in 1998. However, her husband and several doctors stated she was cured through conventional medical treatment, not divine intervention[^33]. The Catholic Church proceeded with the beatification nonetheless.

## Personal Life

Mother Teresa's personal life was characterized by deep religious conviction, austere living conditions, and an inner spiritual struggle that remained hidden from the public for decades. Despite her global fame, she maintained a simple lifestyle, owning only three saris, a pair of sandals, and a metal bucket for washing[^34]. She continued to live in communal quarters with her sisters rather than accepting private accommodations, and she traveled in economy class even when donors offered better arrangements.

Her daily routine reflected her religious devotion. She rose at 4:40 AM each day for prayer and mass, which she considered the center of her life and work[^35]. She spent hours in prayer and adoration before the Blessed Sacrament, famously saying, "I see Jesus in every human being. I say to myself, this is hungry Jesus, I must feed him. This is sick Jesus. This one has leprosy or gangrene; I must wash him and tend to him."

Mother Teresa was known for her strong, determined personality and could be both tender and demanding. She expected absolute obedience from her sisters and maintained strict rules within the congregation, including prohibitions on modern conveniences, advanced education for sisters, and questioning of orders[^36]. Former members described her leadership as authoritarian, with little tolerance for dissent or individual initiative outside prescribed activities.

Her relationships with her biological family were complicated by her religious calling. After leaving Albania in 1928, she never returned to see her mother or sister. Her mother, Drana, and sister, Aga, remained in Albania, and when the communist government took power, communication became difficult[^37]. Her mother died in 1972, and her sister in 1973, without Mother Teresa being able to visit them. She expressed pain about this separation but maintained that her religious vocation required such sacrifices.

The most surprising revelation about Mother Teresa's personal spiritual life came after her death. In 2007, the book "Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light" published her private correspondence with confessors and superiors, revealing decades of spiritual darkness and doubt[^38]. From shortly after beginning her work with the poor until her death, she experienced what Catholic theology calls "the dark night of the soul"—a profound sense of God's absence.

In letters spanning nearly 50 years, she wrote of feeling abandoned by God, doubting His existence, and experiencing spiritual desolation. In 1959, she wrote, "In my soul I feel just that terrible pain of loss, of God not wanting me, of God not being God, of God not really existing"[^39]. In another letter, she confessed, "I am told God loves me—and yet the reality of darkness and coldness and emptiness is so great that nothing touches my soul."

This revelation shocked many who viewed her as a paragon of faith. However, Catholic theologians noted that such spiritual trials were common among mystics and saints, interpreting her continued service despite doubts as evidence of even greater faith[^40]. Others saw it as evidence of cognitive dissonance or psychological suffering that should have been addressed through therapy rather than theological frameworks.

Despite her inner turmoil, she rarely showed vulnerability publicly. Photographs consistently show her with a serene, gentle smile. Those who worked closely with her described her as having moments of joy and humor, particularly when interacting with children or when her work achieved concrete results[^41]. She could be playful and enjoyed simple pleasures, though she maintained strict boundaries about comfort and self-indulgence.

Her health declined significantly in her later years. She suffered her first heart attack in 1983 while visiting Pope John Paul II in Rome[^42]. She had a second heart attack in 1989 and received a pacemaker. In 1991, she developed pneumonia in Mexico and suffered further heart problems. She offered to resign as head of the Missionaries of Charity in 1990, but the sisters elected her to remain, and she continued leading the organization until 1997.

In her final months, despite severe health problems including malaria, heart failure, and kidney failure, she continued to meet visitors and manage the congregation[^43]. She died on September 5, 1997, at the age of 87, just nine days after her close friend Princess Diana, whose death dominated global news coverage.

## Legacy

Mother Teresa's legacy is complex and contested, representing different things to different constituencies. For the Catholic Church, she became a powerful symbol of faith in action and was fast-tracked to sainthood. Pope John Paul II waived the usual five-year waiting period and began her beatification process just two years after her death[^44]. She was beatified in 2003 and canonized as Saint Teresa of Calcutta on September 4, 2016, by Pope Francis, cementing her status as one of the most recognized Catholic saints of the modern era.

Her image as a global icon of compassion and selfless service transcended religious boundaries. She became synonymous with charity itself, with "Mother Teresa" entering common parlance as a descriptor for exceptional selflessness[^45]. Schools, hospitals, buildings, and streets worldwide bear her name. Her face became one of the most recognizable of the 20th century, appearing on stamps, currencies, and in countless depictions.

The Missionaries of Charity continues to operate globally, though on a somewhat reduced scale. As of 2023, the congregation runs over 750 centers in more than 130 countries, serving the poorest of the poor[^46]. The organization has maintained Mother Teresa's commitment to simple living and direct service, though it faces challenges in recruitment and has closed some houses in recent years.

Her influence on the culture of volunteerism and humanitarian work has been profound. She inspired countless individuals to dedicate their lives to serving others, and organizations worldwide have adopted her model of "hands-on" charity[^47]. The concept of volunteer tourism and gap-year volunteering in developing countries owes much to the attention she brought to such work.

However, her legacy in the medical and public health communities is more problematic. Critics argue that her emphasis on spiritual care over medical treatment, her glorification of suffering, and her opposition to evidence-based interventions set back efforts to improve healthcare for the poor[^48]. They contend that her model of charity—focused on comfort rather than cure, and on individual acts of mercy rather than systemic change—diverted attention and resources from more effective interventions.

In India, her legacy remains particularly complicated. While many Indians revere her for her work with the destitute, others criticize her for perpetuating negative stereotypes about India, for her aggressive conversion practices, and for accepting international donations without transparency about their use[^49]. Some Indian intellectuals argue that she overshadowed indigenous social workers and organizations that were doing similar or more effective work without the same international attention.

Her stance on abortion and contraception became part of her lasting legacy in the realm of reproductive rights. Her vocal opposition provided legitimacy to conservative movements opposing reproductive healthcare access globally[^50]. Reproductive rights advocates view this aspect of her legacy as harmful, particularly in developing countries where maternal mortality remains high.

The revelation of her spiritual doubts has affected her legacy in complex ways. For some believers, it made her more relatable and her perseverance more admirable; for skeptics, it raised questions about whether she should have continued in her role while experiencing such profound doubts[^51]. The Catholic Church has presented her darkness as a mystical participation in Christ's suffering, transforming potential weakness into spiritual strength.

Her legacy also includes the questions she raised about charity, poverty, and justice. Critics argue that her model of charity was palliative rather than transformative, treating symptoms rather than causes of poverty[^52]. They contend that her approach diverted attention from structural solutions to poverty—education, economic development, public health infrastructure, and political reform—in favor of individual acts of mercy that left power structures unchallenged.

Defenders counter that she provided immediate relief to people who would otherwise have died alone and in pain, and that dismissing such work in favor of abstract structural solutions ignores the real suffering of real individuals[^53]. They argue that immediate humanitarian relief and long-term structural reform are both necessary, not mutually exclusive.

Academic reassessments continue to complicate her legacy. Scholars have examined her through various lenses—postcolonial theory, feminist analysis, development studies, medical ethics—generally finding a more ambiguous figure than the pure saint of popular imagination[^54]. These studies situate her work within broader contexts of colonialism, religious conversion, medical paternalism, and the politics of international charity.

Perhaps her most lasting legacy is the conversation she provoked about the nature of charity, the responsibilities of the wealthy toward the poor, and the relationship between faith and action. Whether viewed as a saint or a problematic figure, Mother Teresa made poverty visible to millions who might otherwise have ignored it[^55]. She forced uncomfortable questions about suffering, purpose, and moral obligation that continue to resonate decades after her death.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Mother Teresa emphasize her radical commitment to serving the most marginalized members of society at a time when few others would. Historian David Aikman argues that she "may have done more than any single individual in the 20th century to revive in the Western imagination the traditional Christian emphasis on caring for the sick and the poor"[^56]. Her willingness to personally touch and care for people with leprosy, tuberculosis, and other diseases that made them social outcasts represented a revolutionary act of compassion in the Indian context.

Catholic theologians view her spiritual darkness not as a weakness but as a profound mystical experience that demonstrates authentic faith. Father Brian Kolodiejchuk, the postulator for her canonization cause, argues that her doubts parallel the experience of Saint John of the Cross and other mystic saints, representing a higher form of faith that persists without consolation[^57]. In this interpretation, her continued service despite spiritual desolation demonstrates greater virtue than faith sustained by religious experience.

Many physicians and volunteers who worked with her, while acknowledging limitations, emphasize the context of extreme poverty and limited resources. Dr. David Jeffrey, who studied palliative care in her facilities, argues that critics fail to understand that her hospices served people who had been rejected by hospitals and had no other options[^58]. He notes that she provided human dignity, companionship, and comfort to thousands who would otherwise have died alone on the streets.

Defenders argue that criticisms of her financial management ignore the practical realities of running a global religious congregation. The money was sent to the Vatican and redistributed to missions worldwide, following standard Catholic organizational structures[^59]. They note that the sisters lived in the same austere conditions as those they served, demonstrating that funds were not being misappropriated for personal gain.

Her advocacy against abortion, while controversial, is viewed by pro-life advocates as a courageous moral stance. They argue that she consistently defended the sanctity of life and provided alternatives through her orphanages and adoption services[^60]. Supporters note that she personally cared for thousands of abandoned children who might otherwise have been aborted or left to die.

Indian writer Navin Chawla, who wrote an authorized biography of Mother Teresa, argues that critics from outside India fail to understand the scale of destitution she confronted and the cultural context in which she worked[^61]. He emphasizes that she gained the trust and respect of both Hindu and Muslim communities in Calcutta through her genuine service, transcending religious boundaries in a city marked by sectarian tension.

Scholars of religion note that she successfully adapted traditional Catholic religious life to address modern humanitarian crises, creating a new model of active religious community that appealed to young women seeking lives of service[^62]. Her ability to attract vocations and sustain a growing congregation in an era of declining religious participation in the West represents a significant achievement.

## Negative Views

Critics, led most prominently by Christopher Hitchens, argue that Mother Teresa was fundamentally more interested in promoting Catholic doctrine than in effectively alleviating suffering. Hitchens documented instances where she prioritized conversion over care, opposed medical interventions that contradicted Catholic teaching, and accepted suffering as spiritually beneficial rather than as something to be eliminated[^63]. He argued that she was "not a friend of the poor" but rather "a friend of poverty," glorifying destitution rather than working to end it.

Medical ethicists have harshly criticized the quality of care in Missionaries of Charity facilities. A systematic analysis published in 2013 concluded that the "care" provided was "haphazard" and "below modern medical standards," with inadequate pain management, lack of proper diagnostic procedures, and failure to separate curable from terminal patients[^64]. Critics argue that with the enormous financial resources available to her organization, there was no excuse for such substandard care.

Aroup Chatterjee's extensive research challenges many of Mother Teresa's claims about her work. He argues that she systematically exaggerated the extent of suffering in Calcutta, inflated the number of people she helped, and misrepresented the nature of her facilities to donors[^65]. His investigation found that the organization actually helped far fewer people than commonly believed, and that much of what they did could not properly be called medical care.

Feminist critics argue that Mother Teresa promoted a patriarchal vision of women as self-sacrificing caregivers while opposing reproductive rights that would give women control over their bodies and lives[^66]. They note the contradiction between her own power and autonomy as a religious leader and her advocacy for submissive femininity and unlimited childbearing for other women.

Postcolonial scholars critique Mother Teresa as a representative of "white savior" narratives, even though she was herself Albanian. They argue that her work perpetuated colonial dynamics, with Western donors supporting a Western-style religious organization "saving" Indians rather than supporting indigenous social welfare initiatives[^67]. Her success in fundraising and publicity is attributed partly to her presentation of India as helpless and degraded, requiring outside intervention.

Development economists argue that her model of charity was not only ineffective but actively harmful to genuine development efforts. By providing only palliative care and opposing structural solutions like family planning and economic redistribution, she allowed donors to feel good about charity while avoiding the uncomfortable systemic changes needed to actually reduce poverty[^68]. Resources that flowed to her organization might have been more effectively used by organizations focusing on education, economic development, or public health infrastructure.

Some Indian intellectuals resent the international attention Mother Teresa received while indigenous social reformers working more effectively on similar issues remained unknown. They note that her fame depended partly on Western media's preference for familiar religious narratives over unfamiliar indigenous movements[^69]. Her work in Calcutta, while valuable, was not unique, yet it received disproportionate attention due to her identity and media savvy.

Critics of her canonization process argue that it was rushed for political reasons and that the miracles attributed to her intercession were not adequately verified[^70]. They point to medical professionals who disputed the alleged miraculous healings, suggesting that the Catholic Church prioritized creating a modern saint over rigorously examining the evidence.

Secularists argue that her example has been harmful by suggesting that religious faith is necessary for ethical behavior and humanitarian work. They note that many secular organizations provide better, more effective care without religious motivations, and that her glorification perpetuates the false narrative that morality depends on religion[^71].

Former volunteers and sisters who left the Missionaries of Charity have described an authoritarian organization that discouraged critical thinking, refused to adopt more effective methods even when they became available, and prioritized obedience and maintaining Mother Teresa's legacy over actually improving care for beneficiaries[^72]. These accounts suggest an organization more focused on its own institutional interests than on the people it ostensibly served.
