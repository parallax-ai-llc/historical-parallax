## Overview

The Dot-com Bubble (roughly 1995-2000) was a speculative frenzy around internet companies that inflated stock prices to unsustainable levels before collapsing in 2000-2002. The NASDAQ Composite index rose 400% from 1995 to its peak on March 10, 2000, then crashed 78% over the following two years. Hundreds of internet startups—many with no profits, some with no revenue—went bankrupt. $5 trillion in market value evaporated. Yet the crash also cleared away excess, and many fundamentally sound companies (Amazon, eBay, Google) emerged stronger, transforming the economy. The bubble taught lasting lessons about valuation, hype, and the gap between innovation and investment returns.

## The Bubble Inflates

Metrics: page views, users, "mindshare"—not revenue or profit.

**Companies:**
- Pets.com
- Webvan
- eToys
- Kozmo.com
- Geocities
- Boo.com

### "New Economy" Thinking

**Old rules don't apply:**
- "It's different this time"
- Valuation based on "potential"
- Price-to-earnings ratios meaningless

### Super Bowl Ads (2000)

17 dot-coms advertised at Super Bowl XXXIV ($2.2 million per 30 seconds). Most would be dead within a year.

---

## Peak: March 10, 2000

**NASDAQ Composite:**
- Rose from ~1,000 (1995) to 5,048.62 (March 10, 2000)
- 400%+ gain in 5 years

### Warning Signs Ignored

- Alan Greenspan: "irrational exuberance" (1996)—ignored
- Traditional investors skeptical
- Media celebrated "new paradigm"

---

## The Crash

### Trigger

**Multiple Factors:**
- Interest rate hikes (Fed tightening)
- Japanese recession
- Microsoft antitrust ruling (April 2000)
- Selling begets selling

### Collapse

**March 2000 - October 2002:**
- NASDAQ fell 78%
- Dow fell 38%
- S&P 500 fell 49%

### Bankruptcies

**Dead Companies:**

- **Webvan:** $1 billion raised; bankrupt
- **Boo.com:** $135 million spent; lasted 18 months
- **eToys:** $80 million Super Bowl year; bankrupt 2001

## Aftermath

### Job Losses

**Layoffs:**
200,000+ tech workers in Silicon Valley alone. "Pink slip parties."

### Real Estate

San Francisco Bay Area housing collapsed. Office vacancies soared.

### Venture Capital

Investment dried up. Many VCs went under. Survivors became more cautious.

### Telecom Collapse

WorldCom, Global Crossing bankruptcies. Fiber optic oversupply.

---

## Survivors and Winners

### Amazon

**Nearly Died:**
Stock fell 90%+ from peak. Close to bankruptcy.

Cut costs, focused. Became world's largest retailer.

### Others Who Made It

- eBay
- Priceline
- Expedia
- Yahoo (struggled later)
- Google (IPO 2004, avoided bubble)

### Lesson

Sound fundamentals eventually matter. Survivors had real business models.

## Why Did It Happen?

### Psychology
