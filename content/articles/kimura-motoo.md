## Summary

Kimura Motoo was a Japanese population geneticist who proposed the neutral theory of molecular evolution in 1968, arguing that most evolutionary changes at the molecular level are caused by random genetic drift rather than natural selection. His theory, initially controversial, became one of the most important concepts in evolutionary biology and molecular genetics.
