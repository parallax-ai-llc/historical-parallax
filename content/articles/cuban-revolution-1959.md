## Overview

The Cuban Revolution (1953-1959) was a guerrilla uprising that overthrew the U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and brought Fidel Castro to power. What began as a nationalist revolutionary movement evolved into the first communist state in the Western Hemisphere, fundamentally altering Cold War dynamics. The revolution inspired leftist movements throughout Latin America, triggered the Bay of Pigs invasion and Cuban Missile Crisis, and left Castro in power for nearly 50 years. Cuba's alignment with the Soviet Union placed a communist government just 90 miles from Florida—a strategic reality that shaped U.S. foreign policy for generations.
