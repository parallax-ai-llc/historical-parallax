## Summary

Frederick Carlton "Carl" Lewis is an American former track and field athlete widely regarded as one of the greatest Olympians of all time. Born on July 1, 1961, in Birmingham, Alabama, Lewis dominated sprinting and long jump events throughout the 1980s and 1990s, winning nine Olympic gold medals and one silver medal across four consecutive Olympic Games from 1984 to 1996.[^1] His achievements include matching Jesse Owens's historic four gold medals at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and becoming the only athlete to win four consecutive Olympic gold medals in the long jump.[^2] The International Olympic Committee named him "Sportsman of the Century" in 1999, while Sports Illustrated crowned him "Olympian of the Century."[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Frederick Carlton Lewis was born on July 1, 1961, in Birmingham, Alabama, to William Lewis (1927–1987) and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis.[^4] Both of his parents were accomplished athletes who attended Tuskegee Institute. His father, Bill, ran track and played football, while his mother, Evelyn, was a world-class hurdler who represented the United States at the 1951 Pan-American Games.[^5] Carl was the third of four children in this athletically gifted family. His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues, while his sister Carol became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[^6]

When Carl was still young, his family moved to Willingboro, New Jersey, a middle-class town between Philadelphia and Trenton.[^7] There, his parents worked as high school teachers and founded the Willingboro Track Club, creating an environment that would nurture young athletic talent.[^8] Interestingly, Lewis's parents considered their youngest son "the third-best athlete in a family of four" and initially encouraged him to pursue music lessons.[^9] However, young Carl had other ideas. He went out into his backyard, measured off twenty-nine feet, two-and-a-half inches, and stuck a strip of tape on the ground—a distance that even the world's best athletes could not meet. With singular determination, Lewis began jumping toward that impossible mark.[^10]

His first serious attempt at long jump came when he turned thirteen, and soon he became one of the top junior long jumpers in New Jersey.[^11] Lewis attended Willingboro High School, where he continued to develop his extraordinary talents. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 meters (26 feet 8 inches).[^12] This early achievement was just a glimpse of the greatness to come.

## Rise to Power

Carl Lewis came to the University of Houston as an athlete in 1979, where he would develop into one of the greatest track and field athletes of all time under coach Tom Tellez.[^13] The relationship with Tellez proved pivotal to his development, providing the technical coaching and strategic guidance that would define his career.[^14] During his collegiate career from 1979 to 1983, Lewis won six National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) titles, became a six-time All-American, and claimed nine Southwest Conference (SWC) Championships.[^15] He won national titles in both the long jump and 100 meters during his time as a Cougar.[^16]

Lewis's rapid improvement was extraordinary. On June 20, 1980, he improved his personal best by almost half a meter by leaping 8.62 meters (28 feet 3¼ inches) at the TAC Championships while still a teenager.[^17] By 1980, as a freshman at the University of Houston, Lewis had qualified for the Olympic team in the long jump and as a member of the 4×100 meter relay team.[^18] However, the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics meant Lewis didn't compete that year, delaying his Olympic debut but allowing him more time to develop his skills.

The breakthrough came in 1981 when Lewis ran 10.00 seconds at the Southwest Conference Championships in Dallas on May 16, a time that was the third-fastest in history and stood as the low-altitude record.[^19] For the first time, Lewis was ranked number one in the world in both the 100 meters and the long jump—a rare dual dominance that would become his trademark.[^20] At the 1983 World Athletics Championships, Lewis announced his arrival on the global stage by winning the 100 meters, long jump, and running on the winning 4×100 relay team.[^21] He ran the anchor in the 4×100 meter relay, winning in 37.86 seconds, a new world record and the first in Lewis's career.[^22] The stage was set for his Olympic coronation.

## Major Achievements

Carl Lewis's Olympic career stands as one of the most dominant in sports history. At the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, Lewis achieved what he had dreamed of since childhood: matching his idol Jesse Owens by winning gold in the 100 meters, 200 meters, long jump, and 4×100 meter relay.[^23] Lewis started his quest with a convincing win in the 100 meters, running 9.99 seconds to defeat his nearest competitor, fellow American Sam Graddy, by 0.2 seconds.[^24] The US relay team brought the US home eight meters clear of Jamaica in 37.83 seconds, 0.03 inside the world record they had set in Helsinki the year before—the only track and field world record of the 1984 Olympic Games.[^25]

The 1988 Seoul Olympics marked one of the most controversial moments in Olympic history. Ben Johnson of Canada defeated defending Olympic champion Lewis in what appeared to be a world record time of 9.79 seconds, while Lewis set an American record of 9.92 seconds.[^26] However, two days later, Johnson was stripped of his gold medal and world record after testing positive for stanozolol.[^27] The gold medal was then awarded to Lewis, making him the first man to repeat as Olympic champion in the 100 meters.[^28] Lewis's 9.92 from the Olympic final was recognized as the official world record, breaking the 9.93 mark that Calvin Smith had set in 1983.[^29] At Seoul, Lewis also defended his long jump title and won another gold in the 4×100 meter relay.

At the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, Lewis achieved one of his greatest performances. At the age of 30, he set the 100-meter world record at 9.86 seconds, beating two of the world's best sprinters.[^30] Although almost universally considered the greatest long jumper ever, he never set a world record in that event.[^31] At these same championships, Lewis set his lifetime personal best of 8.87 meters (29 feet 1¼ inches) but lost to Mike Powell, who with a mark of 8.95 meters (29 feet 4 inches), broke Bob Beamon's legendary world record set at the 1968 Olympics—a record that still stands today.[^32]

The 1992 Barcelona Olympics saw Lewis fail to make the cut for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints at the US trials.[^33] However, in the long jump, he jumped 8.67 meters (28 feet 5¼ inches) in the first round, beating world-record holder Mike Powell, who did a final-round 8.64 meters (28 feet 4 inches).[^34] Lewis called himself lucky—he reached 28 feet 5½ inches on his first jump, then sweated out a last try by Powell that fell just 1¼ inches short of catching him.[^35] In the 4×100 meter relay, Lewis anchored another world record, in 37.40 seconds, a time which stood for 16 years.[^36]

Perhaps his most remarkable achievement came at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. On July 29, 1996, at age 35 with his hair flecked with gray, Carl Lewis won his fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal in the long jump.[^37] Lewis "ran through" his first jump and notched a ho-hum 8.14 meters (26.71 feet) on his second leap, but at the very end of the competition, he uncorked another nearly 28-foot jump to win the gold.[^38] This historic achievement made Lewis the first Olympian since American discus thrower Al Oerter to win the same event four times.[^39] Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper whose career spanned from 1979 to 1996, during which he didn't lose in the long jump for a decade, winning 65 consecutive competitions.[^40]

Lewis set world records in the 100 meters twice (1988, 1991), and was a member of teams that posted world records at 4×100 meters six times and 4×200 meters three times.[^41] His world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984.[^42] Lewis won nine Olympic gold medals, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold.[^43] He is one of six athletes to win gold in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games.[^44]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his extraordinary achievements, Carl Lewis's career was marked by significant controversies that complicated his public image. By the time the 1984 Olympics were over, he was being called an arrogant and greedy athlete.[^45] The controversy stemmed largely from the long jump incident where he registered an opening jump good enough for first place and then passed on his next four attempts.[^46] While Lewis was wisely conserving his strength for later sprinting events, the American public viewed this as unsportsmanlike. The impression that Lewis was aloof and egotistical was firmly planted in the public's perception by the end of the 1984 Olympic Games.[^47]

Lewis's ambition was criticized as "cocky" and "arrogant," though recent documentaries note he was "criticized as brash and arrogant just years before those attitudes would be recoded as 'confident.'"[^48] The long jump controversy and his self-congratulatory conduct did not impress several other track stars, and his agent Joe Douglas compared him to pop star Michael Jackson, a comparison which did not go over well.[^49] A bearing bordering the imperious was among the things he continually had to address throughout his career, and media portrayals of Lewis as aloof have most likely contributed to the American public's lukewarm feelings.[^50]

The most damaging controversy involved performance-enhancing drugs. Lewis confirmed reports he tested positive three times at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials for small amounts of banned stimulants.[^51] The executive director of the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) found three kinds of stimulants in Lewis's system: pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.[^52] The U.S. Olympic Committee at first disqualified him, then accepted his appeal based on inadvertent use, with Lewis saying he accidentally consumed the banned substances via cold medication.[^53] International journalists were highly critical of Lewis and the US Olympic Committee, portraying both as sanctimonious, arrogant, and hypocritical.[^54]

After losing to Ben Johnson at the 1988 Seoul Olympics (before Johnson's disqualification), Lewis said, "There are a lot of people coming out of nowhere. I don't think they are doing it without drugs," marking the start of Lewis's calling on the sport to be cleaned up in terms of illegal performance-enhancing drugs.[^55] However, cynics noted that the problem had been in the sport for many years and pointed out that it did not become a cause for Lewis until he was actually defeated.[^56] Ben Johnson told Fox Sports that Lewis tested positive several times before the Olympic Games and challenged him to admit he used performance-enhancing drugs, saying "He is not a man."[^57] Lewis's manager Joe Douglas responded that Lewis never took steroids and never tested positive for steroids.[^58]

On January 21, 1993, Lewis performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" before an NBA game between the New Jersey Nets and Chicago Bulls at Brendan Byrne Arena, in what has gone down as one of the most epic fails of its kind.[^59] He was booed vehemently by the fans and the players seemed hard-pressed to suppress their laughter when Lewis's voice cracked while singing the words "red glare."[^60] ESPN SportsCenter anchor Charley Steiner dubbed the performance "Francis Scott Off-Key," a joke that became legendary.[^61] Lewis later reflected on the incident with good humor, stating: "I'm actually glad it happened, because it's part of your journey."[^62]

In 2011, Lewis attempted to enter politics as a Democratic candidate for District 8 of the New Jersey State Senate.[^63] However, he was disqualified by Lieutenant Governor and secretary of state Kim Guadagno because he did not meet the state's requirement that Senate candidates live in New Jersey for four years.[^64] The controversy centered around Lewis's residency status—he grew up in Willingboro but had recently lived in California, where he owned a home.[^65] A federal appeals court allowed Lewis's name to appear on June primary ballots, and he won his party's nomination unopposed with 2,418 votes.[^66] However, Lewis was ordered off the ballot on September 22 after an extended legal battle, when the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that he wasn't eligible to run.[^67] That ended Lewis's fledgling political career.

## Personal Life

Carl Lewis was born Frederick Carlton Lewis in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, to William Lewis (1927–1987) and Evelyn née Lawler Lewis.[^68] His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team, and Carl was the third of four children.[^69] His elder brother Cleveland Lewis played professional soccer for the Memphis Rogues, while his sister Carol became an elite long jumper, finishing ninth at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.[^70] When Carl was still young, his family moved to Willingboro, New Jersey, where his parents worked as high school teachers and founded the Willingboro Track Club.[^71]

Lewis married Maria Lewis, and the couple has one son named Bakim Lewis, who graduated from basic training combat in 2015 and joined the Army.[^72] According to interviews, Lewis said that while he was focusing on his career, he avoided getting into serious, long-term relationships, sacrificing personal connections for athletic success.[^73] The meeting with his childhood idol Jesse Owens at age 10 had a profound impact on him—his father took him to a track meeting for novices in Philadelphia in 1971 and introduced him to the 57-year-old Owens, making the goal of matching Owens's achievement particularly meaningful for Lewis.[^74]

A major aspect of Lewis's personal philosophy involves his diet. Lewis went vegan in 1990 to help control his weight, adopting the diet around age 30 after meeting Dr. John McDougall, one of the earliest public advocates of the benefits of a plant-based diet, during a TV appearance.[^75] Lewis stated that his best year of track competition was the first year he ate a vegan diet.[^76] More specifically, in 1991, at the age of 30, Lewis beat two of the world's best sprinters to set a new world record for the 100 meters and also achieved a world record with the 4×100 meter relay team.[^77] Lewis said he actually had all his personal bests in the 100 meters and the long jump after he turned 30, after this diet change, and felt lighter, faster, and fitter.[^78] He has been eating a mostly plant-based diet for over 25 years.[^79]

Beyond athletics, Lewis pursued interests in entertainment. He appeared in numerous films and television productions, including cameos in Perfect Strangers, Speed Zone, Alien Hunter, and Material Girls.[^80] He also played Stu in the made-for-TV movie Atomic Twister and took up acting gigs including playing a Miami police officer in the 1987 film "Dirty Laundry."[^81] In 1987, Lewis joined music and was part of the band called "Break it Up," though his career in the music field did not take up very well.[^82] He's long held an interest in a musical career, as evidenced by his 1984 novelty single "Goin' For The Gold," and even released a whole album of electro-funk songs with his band Electric Storm, only available in Japan.[^83]

## Legacy

Carl Lewis's accomplishments have led to numerous accolades that cement his status as one of the greatest athletes of all time. He was voted "World Athlete of the Century" by the International Association of Athletics Federations, "Sportsman of the Century" by the International Olympic Committee, "Olympian of the Century" by Sports Illustrated, and "Athlete of the Year" by Track & Field News in 1982, 1983, and 1984.[^84] Track and Field News suggested that after the 1991 World Championships, "It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field."[^85]

Lewis was a pioneer in terms of the visibility and popularity of track and field in the 1980s and 1990s.[^86] His charisma and media presence helped inspire a new generation of athletes, while his advocacy for drug testing and clean sport became an important part of his legacy.[^87] At the 1996 Olympics, he won his fourth consecutive gold medal in the long jump at 35 years old, with his nine Olympic gold medals being the most by a track and field athlete in modern history.[^88] His world record in the indoor long jump has stood since 1984, and his 65 consecutive victories in the long jump achieved over a span of 10 years remains one of the sport's longest undefeated streaks.[^89]

Lewis's impact extends beyond his competitive achievements. In 2009, he was nominated Goodwill Ambassador for FAO and YUNGA (the UN Food and Agriculture Organization), advocating for fitness, wellness, and ending world hunger, including the launch of the UN's "1 Billion Hungry" project.[^90] He established the Carl Lewis Foundation to empower youth, adults, and families through track and field activities and to enhance their life opportunities through initiatives to strengthen education and support personal health.[^91] The Foundation serves as an umbrella for the many charities that Lewis supports, including the Best Buddies organization, The Wendy Marx Foundation (for organ donor awareness), Ronald McDonald House Charities, and many youth fitness groups.[^92]

Currently, Carl Lewis serves as head coach of the University of Houston track and field program, a position he has held since July 2022.[^93] He joined the Houston Track and Field Coaching staff in 2013 as a volunteer coach for former head coach Leroy Burrell before being brought on full-time the following season.[^94] Before his formal coaching role, Lewis also served as a volunteer track-and-field coach at his alma mater, Willingboro High School.[^95] His return to Houston, where his legendary career was shaped under coach Tom Tellez, represents a full-circle moment in his athletic journey.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and athletics experts widely regard Carl Lewis as the greatest track and field athlete in history. The International Association of Athletics Federations elected him "World Athlete of the Century," while the International Olympic Committee named him "Sportsman of the Century," and Sports Illustrated crowned him "Olympian of the Century."[^96] These honors reflect the consensus view that Lewis's combination of longevity, versatility, and dominance across multiple events remains unparalleled in track and field history.

His achievement of winning four consecutive Olympic gold medals in the long jump from 1984 to 1996 stands as one of the greatest feats in Olympic history, matched only by Al Oerter in the discus.[^97] At age 35, Lewis's victory at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics demonstrated not only his extraordinary natural talent but also his dedication to training and his willingness to adapt, particularly through his adoption of a vegan diet in 1990.[^98] Track and Field News suggested that after the 1991 World Championships, "It had become hard to argue that he is not the greatest athlete ever to set foot on track or field."[^99]

Beyond his competitive achievements, supporters praise Lewis for becoming an advocate for drug testing and clean sport, particularly after the Ben Johnson scandal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.[^100] His humanitarian work as a Goodwill Ambassador for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and his establishment of the Carl Lewis Foundation to support youth through athletics demonstrate a commitment to using his platform for positive social impact.[^101] His pioneering adoption of a plant-based diet and his willingness to speak openly about how it improved his performance have inspired countless athletes to explore similar nutritional approaches.[^102]

### Negative Views

Critics have consistently pointed to Lewis's public image problems, particularly the perception of arrogance that plagued him throughout his career. His ambition was criticized as "cocky" and "arrogant," and media portrayals of Lewis as aloof have most likely contributed to the American public's lukewarm feelings toward him.[^103] Unlike Jesse Owens, whose achievement he matched in 1984, Lewis did not have Owens's appeal to the American public, and his image, almost obsequiously nurtured by his manager, failed to live up to his deeds on the track.[^104]

The drug testing controversy remains the most serious criticism of Lewis's legacy. His admission that he tested positive three times at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials for banned stimulants—pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine—raised serious questions about the integrity of his achievements.[^105] While the U.S. Olympic Committee accepted his appeal based on inadvertent use from cold medication, international journalists were highly critical, portraying both Lewis and the USOC as sanctimonious, arrogant, and hypocritical.[^106] Ben Johnson and other competitors have suggested that Lewis received preferential treatment and challenged him to admit to steroid use, criticism that Lewis's team has firmly denied.[^107]

Critics also note the timing of Lewis's anti-doping advocacy, pointing out that the problem had been in the sport for many years but did not become a cause for Lewis until he was actually defeated by Johnson.[^108] This has led some to view his clean sport advocacy as self-serving rather than principled. The infamous 1993 national anthem performance, while ultimately inconsequential to his athletic legacy, reinforced public perceptions of Lewis as someone whose ego exceeded his abilities outside of track and field.[^109] The failed 2011 New Jersey Senate campaign, which ended due to residency issues, further damaged his reputation and raised questions about his judgment and preparation outside the athletic arena.[^110]
