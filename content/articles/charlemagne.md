## Summary

Charlemagne (742/748–814), also known as Charles the Great, was King of the Franks from 768, King of the Lombards from 774, and Emperor of the Carolingian Empire from 800 until his death.[^1] He united most of Western and Central Europe through an extensive series of military campaigns spanning more than three decades, becoming the first recognized emperor to rule from the west after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.[^2] His reign initiated the Carolingian Renaissance, a period of cultural and intellectual revival that profoundly shaped medieval European civilization.[^3] Often called the "Father of Europe," Charlemagne's legacy includes the foundation of the Holy Roman Empire, comprehensive administrative and religious reforms, and the establishment of educational systems that influenced European culture for centuries.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Charlemagne was born on April 2, likely in 748, though an older tradition gives 742 as his birth year.[^5] His exact birthplace remains unknown, with scholars suggesting various Frankish palaces including Vaires-sur-Marne, Quierzy, and Herstal as possibilities.[^6] He was the eldest son of Pepin the Short, who became King of the Franks in 751 after deposing the last Merovingian king, and Bertrada of Laon.[^7] As a member of the Carolingian dynasty, Charlemagne inherited a legacy of ambition and political acumen that would define his later achievements.

What little is known about Charlemagne's youth suggests that he received practical training for leadership by participating in the political, social, and military activities associated with his father's court.[^8] Unlike many medieval rulers who received primarily ecclesiastical education, Charlemagne's early years focused on martial skills, political strategy, and the art of governance. He accompanied his father on military campaigns and diplomatic missions, gaining firsthand experience in the complexities of ruling a vast and diverse kingdom.

The Frankish court in which Charlemagne matured was a dynamic environment where Germanic warrior traditions blended with Christian ideals and remnants of Roman administrative practices.[^9] This multicultural context shaped Charlemagne's worldview and prepared him for his future role as a unifier of diverse peoples and traditions. His father Pepin had established close relations with the papacy, a alliance that Charlemagne would later strengthen and leverage to unprecedented effect.

When Pepin died in 768, his realm was divided according to Frankish custom between Charlemagne and his younger brother Carloman.[^10] This partition created a tense power-sharing arrangement, with the two brothers receiving geographically fragmented territories that fostered rivalry and suspicion. The split would have likely ended in internecine warfare had Carloman not died unexpectedly in 771, allowing Charlemagne to absorb his brother's territories and assume sole control of the entire Frankish realm.[^11] This fortuitous consolidation of power set the stage for Charlemagne's remarkable expansion and transformation of the Frankish kingdom into a European empire.

## Rise to Power

Charlemagne's ascension to sole rule in 771 marked the beginning of an extraordinary political career that would reshape the map of Europe.[^12] Upon Carloman's death, Charlemagne moved swiftly to consolidate power, securing the loyalty of his late brother's followers and integrating the divided territories into a unified kingdom. This decisive action demonstrated the political acumen and ruthless efficiency that would characterize his entire reign.

Shortly after consolidating his power, Charlemagne divorced his first wife Desiderata, daughter of the Lombard King Desiderius, after only one year of marriage.[^13] This political marriage had been arranged by his mother Bertrada to secure peace with the Lombards, but Charlemagne's annulment signaled a dramatic shift in Frankish-Lombard relations. When Pope Adrian I appealed for protection against Lombard aggression in 773, Charlemagne responded with military force, leading a victorious expedition into Italy that culminated in the conquest of the Lombard kingdom in 774.[^14] By assuming the Lombard crown and annexing northern Italy, Charlemagne doubled the size of his realm and established himself as the dominant power in western Europe.

The initial decades of Charlemagne's reign were characterized by near-constant military campaigning.[^15] His armies operated simultaneously on multiple fronts, subjugating the Saxons in the north, fighting Muslim forces in Spain, incorporating Bavaria in the east, and later conquering the Avar empire in present-day Hungary.[^16] These campaigns were motivated by diverse factors: defending his realm against external threats, pursuing conquest and booty, spreading Christianity, and exploiting opportunities presented by shifting power dynamics.[^17]

The relationship with the papacy proved crucial to Charlemagne's rise to imperial status. When Pope Leo III was violently attacked in Rome in 799 by political enemies who attempted to blind and mutilate him, he fled to Charlemagne seeking protection.[^18] Charlemagne traveled to Rome in 800 to restore order and adjudicate the matter. On December 23, Pope Leo III publicly cleared himself of the charges against him in Charlemagne's presence.[^19] Two days later, on Christmas Day 800, during Mass at St. Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo suddenly placed a crown on Charlemagne's head and proclaimed him "Emperor of the Romans."[^20]

The coronation of 800 was a watershed moment in European history, restoring the imperial title in the West for the first time since the fall of Rome over three centuries earlier.[^21] According to Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, the king claimed to be surprised and even displeased by the coronation, stating he would not have entered the church had he known the pope's intention.[^22] However, modern historians debate whether this surprise was genuine or a calculated display of humility. Regardless of Charlemagne's personal feelings, the coronation established a new political reality: the revival of the Western Roman Empire and the creation of a formal alliance between temporal and spiritual authority that would define European politics for centuries.[^23]

## Major Achievements

Charlemagne's reign produced transformative achievements across military, administrative, cultural, and religious spheres that fundamentally reshaped European civilization.[^24] His impact extended far beyond military conquest to encompass comprehensive reforms that created enduring institutions and cultural frameworks.

### Military Conquests and Territorial Expansion

Charlemagne's military achievements were staggering in scope and duration. By 800, he ruled an empire encompassing present-day France, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and parts of Austria, Spain, and Italy.[^25] The Saxon Wars (772-804) represented his most demanding military undertaking, requiring more than thirty years of campaigning and eighteen separate expeditions to finally subjugate the fiercely independent Saxon tribes.[^26] His conquest of the Lombard kingdom in 774 secured northern Italy and strengthened his position as protector of the papacy.[^27]

The Avar campaigns (791-796) destroyed a powerful steppe empire and captured enormous quantities of treasure accumulated over centuries of raiding.[^28] This victory opened central Europe to Frankish control and Christian missionary activity. In Spain, Frankish forces established the Spanish March, a buffer zone between the Pyrenees and Ebro River that protected against Muslim incursions.[^29] The forcible annexation of Bavaria in 787-788 eliminated a semi-independent duchy that had long resisted Frankish overlordship.[^30] These conquests roughly doubled the size of the Frankish state and created an empire that united most of Western and Central Europe under a single ruler for the first time since the Roman Empire.[^31]

### The Carolingian Renaissance

Charlemagne served as the primary initiator and patron of the Carolingian Renaissance, a remarkable period of cultural and intellectual revival.[^32] Taking inspiration from the Christian Roman Empire of the fourth century, Charlemagne sought to create a "New Rome" through systematic educational and cultural reforms.[^33]

He gathered leading scholars from across Europe at his palace in Aachen, creating a intellectual powerhouse that became the center of Western learning.[^34] The most influential member of this scholarly circle was Alcuin of York, an English cleric who headed the palace school and advised Charlemagne on educational policy.[^35] The Admonitio generalis of 789, a comprehensive legislative document, mandated educational and ecclesiastical reforms throughout the Frankish kingdom and became the foundation for the Carolingian Renaissance.[^36]

The cultural impact of these reforms proved profound and lasting. Scriptoria in monasteries and cathedrals produced an estimated 90,000 manuscripts during the ninth century, copying both new works and preserving ancient texts.[^37] Most presently surviving works of classical Latin literature were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars, making the earliest available manuscripts for many ancient texts Carolingian in origin.[^38] The development and popularization of Carolingian minuscule script revolutionized medieval copying and directly influenced Renaissance and modern typefaces.[^39]

Educational reforms extended beyond the clergy to include members of the aristocracy and even some laypeople.[^40] Charlemagne established schools at cathedrals and monasteries throughout his realm, creating an educational infrastructure that served as the basis for later medieval universities.[^41] Scholar John J. Contreni considers this educational revival "one of the most durable and resilient elements of the Carolingian legacy."[^42]

### Administrative and Legal Reforms

As emperor, Charlemagne implemented comprehensive reforms in governance, administration, law, and military organization that shaped European institutions for centuries.[^43] He revolutionized the administrative system through capitularies—royal legislative documents that recorded administrative procedures and enacted laws discussed at annual assemblies.[^44] These ordinances addressed diverse issues including administration of royal domains, public order, justice, and ecclesiastical matters.[^45]

The capitulary of 802, Capitulare missorum generale, represented an expansive piece of legislation governing the conduct of royal officials.[^46] It reformed the institution of the missi dominici, officials assigned in pairs (one ecclesiastical, one lay) to administer justice and oversee governance in defined territories.[^47] These royal agents made regular circuits to announce the king's will, gather information on local officials' performance, and correct abuses, thereby integrating central and local administration.[^48]

The greatly expanded use of written documents enhanced communication between central and local governments, allowing greater precision and uniformity in transmitting royal orders and gathering information about their execution.[^49] Charlemagne established a system of counts (comites) to administer various regions, with counts responsible for maintaining order, collecting taxes, and administering justice in their territories.[^50]

Legal reforms included replacing local assessors with trained officials called scabini, who were required to be literate and apply laws consistently.[^51] Capitularies introduced the inquisition system, empowering judges to summon credible local witnesses.[^52] Charlemagne issued edicts to combat judicial corruption, particularly prohibiting judges from accepting gifts.[^53] His legal system maintained the principle of personality of law, allowing different ethnic groups within the multi-ethnic empire to be tried under their own traditional laws.[^54]

### Religious Reforms

Charlemagne's religious reforms focused on strengthening ecclesiastical hierarchy, improving clergy quality, standardizing liturgical practices, and expanding pastoral care.[^55] He appointed and deposed bishops, directed biblical text revision, instituted liturgical changes, established monastic rules, and dispatched investigators to dismiss inadequately learned or pious priests.[^56] His liturgical reforms aligned with Roman patterns and maintained Latin as the language of religious services.[^57]

These reforms vested the ruler with unprecedented authority to discipline clerics, control ecclesiastical property, propagate faith, and define orthodox doctrine.[^58] Despite this aggressive expansion of royal authority over traditionally ecclesiastical matters, Charlemagne's reforms won acceptance from the church establishment, including the papacy.[^59]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his celebrated achievements, Charlemagne's reign included brutal episodes and policies that generated significant criticism both from contemporaries and later historians.[^60] His methods of conquest and conversion, particularly during the Saxon Wars, reveal a darker dimension of his rule that complicates his historical legacy.

### The Saxon Wars and Forced Conversions

The Saxon Wars (772-804) exemplified the most controversial aspects of Charlemagne's reign.[^61] His campaign to subjugate and forcibly convert the pagan Saxons involved systematic violence, mass executions, and cultural destruction that shocked even some of his own advisors.[^62] In 785, Charlemagne issued the Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae, which declared that any Saxon refusing baptism should be punished by death.[^63] This draconian policy conflicted fundamentally with Christian principles of voluntary conversion and provoked objections from religious leaders.

Alcuin of York, one of Charlemagne's closest advisors and the leading intellectual of his court, explicitly criticized this policy of forced conversion.[^64] Alcuin argued that "faith is a free act of the will, not a forced act. We must appeal to the conscience, not compel it by violence."[^65] This contemporaneous criticism from a trusted advisor reveals that Charlemagne's methods generated moral concerns even among his supporters.

### The Massacre of Verden

The most notorious episode of the Saxon Wars occurred in 782 at Verden, where Charlemagne ordered the execution of 4,500 Saxon prisoners in a single day.[^66] This mass beheading, carried out in response to Saxon rebellion and their continued adherence to pagan beliefs, represented an act of unprecedented brutality intended to terrorize the Saxon population into submission.[^67] The Massacre of Verden became a focal point for later critics of Charlemagne's legacy.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was among the first prominent intellectuals to suggest that Verden cast a permanent shadow over Charlemagne's historical reputation.[^68] The philosopher Voltaire went further, condemning Charlemagne as a "thousand-fold murderer" and viewing his reign as exemplifying the darkness and barbarism of the medieval period.[^69] These Enlightenment-era critiques challenged the hagiographic traditions that had portrayed Charlemagne as a model Christian ruler.

### Forced Deportations and Cultural Genocide

When Saxon resistance continued despite brutal suppression, Charlemagne resorted to demographic engineering, ordering the deportation of 10,000 Saxons to Neustria and replacing them with Frankish settlers.[^70] This policy of forced population transfer aimed to destroy Saxon cultural cohesion and eliminate the possibility of future rebellion. Modern historians have characterized these actions as early forms of ethnic cleansing designed to eradicate Saxon identity and resistance.

### Moral and Historical Assessments

Charlemagne's wars were "not glorious and full of chivalrous feats; they were bloody, destructive, and were marked by either compulsory mass conversions or forced migration."[^71] This assessment by modern scholars contrasts sharply with medieval romanticized accounts of Charlemagne's conquests. The systematic nature of the violence—combining military force, religious coercion, mass execution, and population displacement—reveals a calculated strategy of total subjugation that raises profound ethical questions.

The debate over Charlemagne's methods continues among historians. Defenders argue his actions must be understood within the context of eighth-century warfare and the religious worldview that saw forced conversion as saving souls from damnation. Critics contend that even by contemporary standards, his brutality was exceptional and that religious justifications do not excuse what amounted to war crimes and cultural destruction.[^72]

## Personal Life

Charlemagne's personal life reveals a complex figure who combined intellectual curiosity, devotion to family, and traditional warrior masculinity with the responsibilities of ruling a vast empire.[^73] His domestic arrangements, personal habits, and relationships with his numerous children provide insight into the man behind the imperial title.

### Marriages and Family

Charlemagne had at least twenty children with approximately ten wives and concubines, reflecting both medieval noble marriage practices and his personal appetites.[^74] His marital history included five sequential wives and several concurrent concubines. His first significant relationship was with Himiltrude, a concubine who bore his eldest son Pepin before Charlemagne's first formal marriage.[^75]

In 770, Charlemagne married Desiderata, daughter of the Lombard King Desiderius, in a political alliance arranged by his mother Bertrada.[^76] However, he divorced her after only one year, an action that precipitated conflict with the Lombards. He then married Hildegard, a Swabian noblewoman who became his longest-lasting wife and bore him nine children before dying from complications of her final pregnancy in 783.[^77]

His fourth wife, Fastrada, was remembered as beautiful but ambitious and cruel, with Einhard suggesting she exerted a negative influence on Charlemagne.[^78] His final wife, Liutgard, was recalled as ailing but good and devout, dying in 800 without bearing children.[^79] After Liutgard's death, Charlemagne did not remarry but had children with several concubines including Gersuinda from Saxony, Regina, and Adalinda.[^80]

### Relationship with His Children

Charlemagne proved an unusually devoted father by medieval royal standards.[^81] He insisted that all his children, including his daughters, receive comprehensive education in the liberal arts—a progressive stance for the era.[^82] He encouraged their intellectual development and ensured they received education befitting their noble status, with many becoming royal figures, religious leaders, and scholars.[^83]

Remarkably, Charlemagne refused to allow any of his daughters to marry, claiming he could not bear to be without their company.[^84] This possessive devotion had significant consequences: his daughters had sexual relationships and bore children but remained unmarried throughout his lifetime, creating ambiguous social positions for his illegitimate grandchildren. This decision reflected both his deep attachment to his children and perhaps an unwillingness to create potential rival power centers through his daughters' marriages to foreign princes.

### Personal Habits and Character

Contemporary accounts describe Charlemagne as a man of robust appetites and habits.[^85] He enjoyed good food, particularly roasted meat, which was his favorite.[^86] He frequently complained that religious fasting harmed his health and developed an aversion to physicians in his later years when they recommended he abandon grilled food in favor of stew.[^87] During meals, he enjoyed listening to music or having historical texts and tales of ancient heroes read aloud.[^88]

Charlemagne was multilingual, speaking Latin and having some knowledge of Greek in addition to his native Frankish tongue.[^89] The question of his literacy remains debated among scholars, with limited direct evidence. Contemporary sources indicate he normally had texts read aloud to him and dictated responses, though he made efforts to learn writing later in life.[^90]

Physically, Charlemagne wore his hair short and maintained a mustache, contrasting with the bearded Merovingian kings who preceded him.[^91] Ninth-century depictions show him as mustachioed with short hair, as also appeared on contemporary coinage.[^92] Einhard describes him as being in good health for most of his life, though the final four years brought frequent fevers and a limp.[^93]

On January 21, 814, Charlemagne developed pleurisy and was bedridden for seven days before dying on the morning of January 28, 814, at approximately 72 years of age.[^94] He was buried at the cathedral in Aachen, the city he had made his imperial capital.[^95]

## Legacy

Charlemagne's death in 814 marked the end of an era, but his influence on European civilization extended far beyond his lifetime, shaping political, cultural, religious, and educational institutions for more than a millennium.[^96] His legacy encompasses both concrete institutional achievements and symbolic significance as a foundational figure in European identity.

### Political and Institutional Legacy

Charlemagne is considered the forerunner to the line of Holy Roman Emperors, which persisted until 1806—almost a millennium after his death.[^97] The Holy Roman Empire, though it evolved significantly and became increasingly fragmented over time, remained a cornerstone of medieval European politics and provided a framework for organizing the complex network of kingdoms, duchies, and ecclesiastical territories in central Europe.[^98] His coronation in 800 established precedents for the relationship between secular and religious authority that defined European politics throughout the medieval period.[^99]

The administrative and legal reforms Charlemagne implemented created templates for governance that influenced European political development for centuries.[^100] His use of written documents for administration, systematic use of royal agents (missi dominici), and attempts to create standardized legal procedures established models that later rulers adapted and expanded.[^101] The capitulary system he developed became a standard form of royal legislation in medieval Europe.[^102]

### Cultural and Educational Impact

The cultural infrastructure created during the Carolingian Renaissance proved even more enduring than Charlemagne's political empire.[^103] The educational system he established—with schools at cathedrals and monasteries throughout his realm—served as the foundation for later medieval universities and the preservation of classical learning.[^104] Scholar John J. Contreni's assessment that the educational revival constitutes "one of the most durable and resilient elements of the Carolingian legacy" reflects the profound impact of these reforms.[^105]

The preservation of classical texts by Carolingian scriptoria ensured the survival of much of the Western literary and philosophical heritage.[^106] Without the systematic copying efforts initiated under Charlemagne, many ancient works would have been lost forever. The Carolingian minuscule script developed in this period directly influenced Renaissance typefaces and ultimately modern fonts, making Charlemagne's cultural program relevant even to contemporary typography.[^107]

### Symbolic Significance: "Father of Europe"

Charlemagne's unification of most of Western and Central Europe under a single ruler earned him the title "Father of Europe" from many historians.[^108] Multiple European states regard him as a founding figure, and several historical royal houses trace their lineage to him.[^109] This widespread claim to Carolingian descent reflects both genuine genealogical connections (Charlemagne's numerous descendants spread throughout European nobility) and the symbolic value of association with his legacy.

In modern times, Charlemagne has been adopted as a symbol of European integration.[^110] The Charlemagne Prize, established in 1950 in Aachen, is awarded annually to individuals who contribute to European unity, explicitly invoking Charlemagne's unification of Europe as a historical precedent for contemporary integration efforts. This symbolic appropriation demonstrates how Charlemagne's legacy continues to be reinterpreted and deployed for contemporary political purposes.

### Religious Legacy

The alliance Charlemagne forged between the Frankish monarchy and the papacy established patterns of church-state relations that persisted throughout the medieval period and beyond.[^111] His coronation as emperor by the pope created a precedent where spiritual authority legitimized temporal power, while temporal power protected and supported the institutional church. This symbiotic relationship, despite periodic conflicts, became a defining feature of medieval European Christendom.[^112]

His aggressive promotion of Christianity through conquest and his territorial expansion of Christendom contributed to the Christianization of central and northern Europe.[^113] The missionary infrastructure he established in conquered territories, particularly among the Saxons and Avars, brought these regions permanently into the Christian cultural sphere.

### Contested Legacy

Despite widespread veneration, Charlemagne's legacy remains contested, particularly regarding his methods of conquest and conversion.[^114] The brutality of the Saxon Wars, the Massacre of Verden, and policies of forced conversion continue to generate historical debate about whether the ends justified the means. His legacy thus encompasses both remarkable cultural achievements and troubling episodes of violence and coercion that resist simple heroic narratives.[^115]

The extraordinary longevity of Charlemagne's influence—spanning more than twelve centuries from his death to the present—testifies to the profound and multifaceted nature of his historical impact.[^116] He remains a reference point for understanding European rulership, cultural development, and political organization, ensuring his continued relevance to contemporary historical understanding.[^117]

## Historical Assessment

The assessment of Charlemagne by historians, philosophers, and scholars has varied dramatically across different eras and interpretive frameworks, reflecting both changing historical methodologies and evolving values.[^118] His complex legacy resists simple categorization, generating ongoing scholarly debate about his achievements, methods, and historical significance.

### Positive Views

Medieval and early modern scholars typically portrayed Charlemagne in highly favorable terms, often approaching hagiography.[^119] He featured prominently in chivalric literature as one of the Nine Worthies, heroic figures representing the ideals of medieval knighthood. The chanson de geste tradition, particularly the Song of Roland, romanticized his military campaigns and portrayed him as the ideal Christian warrior-king defending Christendom against pagan and Muslim threats.[^120]

Modern scholarly assessments, while more critical and nuanced, recognize genuine and substantial achievements. Historians credit Charlemagne with creating "increased central control, efficient bureaucracy, accountability, and cultural renaissance" through his administrative reforms.[^121] His patronage of learning and systematic preservation of classical texts earned him recognition as a pivotal figure in Western cultural history. Without his initiatives, much of the classical heritage would have been irretrievably lost.[^122]

The Carolingian Renaissance represents perhaps his most universally praised achievement.[^123] Educational reforms that created infrastructure for learning, promoted literacy among clergy and aristocracy, and established scriptoria that produced thousands of manuscripts fundamentally shaped medieval intellectual culture. Scholar John J. Contreni's characterization of this educational revival as "one of the most durable and resilient elements of the Carolingian legacy" reflects broad scholarly consensus on its importance.[^124]

Charlemagne's role in preserving political order and preventing the complete collapse of centralized authority in post-Roman Europe receives positive assessment from historians studying this transitional period.[^125] His ability to create functional administrative systems, maintain law and order across vast territories, and provide relative stability during a turbulent era represents genuine political achievement deserving recognition.

Some political philosophers, notably Montesquieu, viewed Charlemagne as a proto-constitutional monarch and protector of freedoms, finding in his reign precedents for limited monarchy and respect for traditional rights.[^126] This Enlightenment-era interpretation sought historical legitimization for contemporary political ideals by projecting them backward onto Charlemagne's reign.

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of Charlemagne have intensified since the Enlightenment, with scholars increasingly willing to challenge hagiographic traditions.[^127] Voltaire offered a scathing counter-narrative, portraying Charlemagne as a despotic ruler and "thousand-fold murderer" whose reign exemplified medieval darkness and barbarism rather than enlightenment.[^128] This characterization, while polemical, drew attention to the brutal aspects of Charlemagne's conquests that earlier accounts had glossed over or justified.

Modern historians examining the Saxon Wars have produced particularly critical assessments.[^129] Scholar analysis reveals that "the wars that Charlemagne led were not glorious and full of chivalrous feats; they were bloody, destructive, and were marked by either compulsory mass conversions or forced migration."[^130] The Massacre of Verden, forced conversions under threat of death, and systematic deportations of Saxon populations constitute dark episodes that resist justification even within historical context.

The forced conversion policies generated criticism even from contemporaries like Alcuin, indicating they violated accepted norms of the era.[^131] This contemporary dissent undermines arguments that Charlemagne's methods simply reflected eighth-century standards, suggesting instead that his brutality was exceptional even by the standards of his time.

Administrative historians debate Charlemagne's governmental effectiveness, with some advancing "an ultimately pessimistic verdict on Charles' achievement as doomed to long-term failure because of the lack of 'an adequate centralised administration.'"[^132] The rapid fragmentation of his empire after his death—divided among his grandsons within a generation—supports arguments that his political construction lacked sustainable foundations.

Historians examining his final years identify "emerging crisis, in which the activities of the aging emperor were increasingly constricted," suggesting decline in effectiveness and perhaps judgment.[^133] Questions about whether apparent achievements represented genuine transformation or merely temporary impositions maintained through personal force remain subjects of scholarly debate.

### Methodological Challenges

Contemporary scholarly assessment acknowledges profound methodological difficulties in evaluating Charlemagne.[^134] The sources present challenges, as "the agendas and purposes of these sources, along with the extended afterlife of their subject in the memorials and myths of later medieval Europe, render the task of separating historical fiction from historical fact notoriously difficult."[^135]

Each generation of scholars over the twelve centuries since his death has offered "its own insights and interpretive contributions," reflecting how Charlemagne serves as a screen onto which successive eras project their own values and concerns.[^136] This interpretive multiplicity suggests that definitive assessment may be impossible, with Charlemagne remaining a fundamentally contested and ambiguous historical figure whose legacy encompasses both remarkable achievements and troubling brutality that defy simple moral judgment.
