## Summary

The **Congo Free State** (1885–1908) was a unique colony owned personally by King **Leopold II** of Belgium, not the Belgian state. Under his absolute rule, the territory was exploited for ivory and, crucially, **wild rubber**. To meet booming global demand for rubber (for tires), Leopold's administration unleashed a regime of terror, slave labor, and mutilation that reduced the population by an estimated 50%. It remains one of the greatest crimes of the colonial era.

## The Rubber Terror

### The Quota System
Villages were assigned impossible quotas of rubber to harvest from the jungle vines.
*   **Hostage Taking:** When quotas were not met, the *Force Publique* (a mercenary army led by white officers) would kidnap the women of the village, holding them hostage to force the men into the forest. Women were often raped and starved while in captivity.

### The "Chicotte"
The primary instrument of punishment was the **chicotte**, a whip made of sun-dried hippopotamus hide with sharp edges.
*   **Effect:** A beating of 100 lashes was often fatal. Prisoners were whipped publicly to terrorize the community.

### Severed Hands
The most enduring image of Leopold's Congo is the basket of severed hands.
*   **The Logic:** Ammunition was expensive and imported. Soldiers were required to prove they hadn't wasted bullets hunting for food. For every bullet fired, they had to present a **severed right hand** to their white officers.
*   **Living Victims:** If soldiers missed or used bullets for hunting, they would simply cut the hands off living people—men, women, and children—to meet their tally. Missionaries took famous photographs of Congolese fathers staring at the severed hands and feet of their small children, which sparked global outrage.

## The "King Sovereign"

Leopold II never visited the Congo. He branded himself a philanthropist bringing "civilization" and Christianity to Africa. He used the massive profits to build grand monuments in Brussels and Ostend (the "Builder King"), while his private army turned the Congo into a slave labor camp.

## International Outrage

The Congo Free State sparked the world's first modern humanitarian rights movement.
*   **E.D. Morel:** A shipping clerk who noticed that ships arriving in Antwerp were full of rubber/ivory but returned to Congo carrying only guns and ammo. He deduced that there was no trade, only slavery.
*   **Roger Casement:** A British diplomat whose 1904 report detailed the atrocities officially confirms Morel's findings.
*   **Writers:** Mark Twain (*King Leopold's Soliloquy*) and Joseph Conrad (*Heart of Darkness*) wrote works condemning the exploitation.

### The End of the Free State
Under immense international pressure, the Belgian parliament forced Leopold II to relinquish the colony in 1908. It was annexed by Belgium and renamed the Belgian Congo. While the worst excesses (hand severing) stopped, forced labor continued for decades.
