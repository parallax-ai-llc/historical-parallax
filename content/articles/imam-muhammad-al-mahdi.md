## Summary

Muhammad al-Mahdi is the twelfth and final Imam in Twelver Shia Islam. According to Shia belief, he went into occultation (ghayba) in 874 as a child and will return at the end of times as the Mahdi to establish justice on earth. His occultation is divided into the Minor Occultation (874-941) and the Major Occultation (941-present). The belief in his return is a central tenet of Twelver Shia eschatology.
