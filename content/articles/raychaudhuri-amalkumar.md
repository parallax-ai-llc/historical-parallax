## Summary

Amal Kumar Raychaudhuri derived the Raychaudhuri equation in 1955, which describes the motion of nearby bits of matter and became fundamental to Penrose and Hawking's singularity theorems in general relativity. His equation proved that gravitational singularities (like the Big Bang) are inevitable in general relativity. He spent his career in India with minimal recognition.
