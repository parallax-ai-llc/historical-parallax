## Summary

Naw K'nyaw Paw (born circa 1980) is a prominent Karen human rights activist and peace builder from Myanmar who has dedicated her life to advancing women's rights, indigenous rights, and justice for ethnic minorities. As General Secretary of the Karen Women's Organisation (KWO) since 2013, she leads an organization of over 70,000 members working in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border and in Karen State. In 2019, she received the U.S. Department of State's International Women of Courage Award for her courageous advocacy, particularly for speaking out against military violence targeting the Rohingya people and documenting sexual violence as a weapon of war.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Naw K'nyaw Paw was born along the Salween River on the border between Thailand and Burma, in the mountain country of Burma's south-eastern Karen province. Her mother gave her the name K'nyaw Paw, meaning "Karen Flower" in the Karen language.[^3][^4] Her parents fled Burma after the government started the notorious "Four Cuts" strategy against ethnic armed groups in the late 1970s—a brutal military doctrine involving forced relocations, destruction of villages, and collective punishment designed to cut off food, funds, information, and recruitment to insurgent groups.[^5][^6]

As a young child, Naw K'nyaw Paw grew up moving back and forth across the Thai-Burma border, her family seeking temporary shelter in Thailand after Burma Army attacks—sometimes for one month, sometimes three months, and sometimes a year.[^7] In 1991, when intensive fighting made it impossible to return to Burma, she became a refugee at age 11 after the Burma Army attacked her village. She recalls coming home from school to find her parents had fled from attacks by the Burmese army.[^8][^9]

She joined approximately 110,000 Karen people living in seven refugee camps that run the length of the Thai-Burma border. Despite the hardships of displacement, Naw K'nyaw Paw completed her education in Mae Ra Moe refugee camp in Thailand.[^10][^11] Growing up in the camps, she witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of conflict on civilians, particularly women and children, which would shape her lifelong commitment to human rights advocacy.

## Rise to Prominence

After finishing high school in the refugee camps, Naw K'nyaw Paw joined the Karen Women's Organization (KWO) in 1999, beginning what would become a distinguished career in women's rights and peace advocacy.[^12] The KWO, originally formed in 1949 and re-organized in 1985, is a leading indigenous women's organization working to ensure gender equality, protection of indigenous people's rights, human rights, and justice for communities in Karen State and refugee camps.[^13]

Within the organization, Naw K'nyaw Paw quickly distinguished herself as a capable leader and trainer. She held numerous positions including Coordinator of the Human Rights and Democracy (Youth) Education program, Women's Rights and Leadership Trainer, Advocacy Team Leader, and KWO Emerging Leaders School and Education Program Coordinator.[^14] She was one of the first young KWO leaders to initiate and conduct Human Rights and Democracy Training programs along the Thai-Burma border, demonstrating her commitment to capacity building and grassroots empowerment.[^15]

In February 2013, at the 6th Karen Women Organization Conference, Naw K'nyaw Paw was elected General Secretary of the KWO, taking on leadership of an organization with over 60,000 members at the time.[^16][^17] Her election represented a generational shift toward younger, more dynamic leadership within the Karen movement. In 2014, she received the prestigious Padoh Mahn Sha Young Leader Award, which honors young Karen people under 35 who have made outstanding contributions to their communities and organizations.[^18][^19]

## Major Achievements

### Leadership of the Karen Women's Organisation

Under Naw K'nyaw Paw's leadership as General Secretary, the KWO has expanded its reach and impact significantly. The organization now has more than 70,000 members living in Karen State, Burma, and in refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border.[^20] In 2023 alone, KWO programs reached more than 140,582 women, men, and children as direct beneficiaries, implementing 17 individually funded projects with over 100,500 beneficiaries.[^21]

The organization operates four main programs: Organising and Information Sharing, Education, Health, and Social Welfare. KWO's Education Program provides schooling where there are gaps in mainstream services, including a pioneering Special Education Project—the only one of its kind in the refugee camps and Karen State providing assistance to children with disabilities and their families.[^22][^23] The Health Program addresses community health issues with a focus on women's and children's health, reproductive rights, and access to clean water and sanitation.[^24]

### Documentation of Sexual Violence and War Crimes

One of Naw K'nyaw Paw's most significant achievements has been leading KWO's systematic documentation of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict zones since 2004. At great personal risk, she and her organization have documented military atrocities, including 125 cases of sexual violence committed by military troops in Karen State from 1988 until 2004, half committed by high-ranking military officers. According to KWO reports, 40 percent of these cases were gang rapes, and in 28 percent, women were raped and then killed.[^25][^26]

KWO's groundbreaking reports, including "Shattering Silences" and "Salt in the Wound," have documented prolific sexual violence in eastern Myanmar and more recently in refugee camps along the Thai-Myanmar border, providing crucial evidence of sexual violence as a weapon of war.[^27]

### Courageous Advocacy for the Rohingya

In 2017, under Naw K'nyaw Paw's leadership, the KWO became the first of three women's civil society organizations in Myanmar to publicly condemn the military-led violence against the Rohingya people in Rakhine State—a remarkably courageous stance given the political sensitivities and risks involved.[^28][^29] She explained this decision by stating: "We have been consistently speaking out against the Burma Army's [Myanmar military's] abuses of ethnic women and of the women in Burma, regardless of their background, including Rohingya women. So when the Myanmar military abuses the Rohingya women we also show our solidarity, because we know that the Myanmar military has been abusing other ethnic women—Karen, Kachin, Shan, Ta'ang—and now they are abusing the Rohingya women."[^30]

### International Women of Courage Award

On March 7, 2019, U.S. Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo presented Naw K'nyaw Paw with the International Women of Courage Award at the U.S. Department of State.[^31][^32] She was one of 10 recipients honored that year and the third woman from Myanmar to receive this prestigious award, which recognizes women around the globe who have demonstrated exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for peace, justice, human rights, gender equality, and women's empowerment.[^33]

### United Nations Advocacy

Naw K'nyaw Paw has represented Karen women and ethnic minorities on the international stage, traveling with Women's League of Burma representatives to Geneva and New York to attend the UN Human Rights Council, the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII).[^34][^35] At these forums, she has raised critical issues affecting her community, including human rights violations, women's rights, indigenous rights, and refugee issues, amplifying voices that are often marginalized in peace processes.

### COVID-19 Pandemic Response

During the COVID-19 pandemic, when Myanmar's central government largely excluded ethnic minorities from their pandemic response and failed to translate health information into indigenous languages, Naw K'nyaw Paw and the KWO stepped in to protect vulnerable communities. When the virus began spreading in Myanmar, preventative measures disrupted aid and made earning a living impossible for internally displaced people and refugees in camps along the Myanmar-Thailand border. Despite these challenges, KWO provided essential services and health information to ethnic minority communities.[^36][^37]

In the six months following the 2021 military coup, as fighting intensified, KWO helped provide food and shelter to more than 120,000 people fleeing bombing by the Burmese Military.[^38]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Challenges Within the Peace Process

Naw K'nyaw Paw has been outspoken about the shortcomings of Myanmar's peace process, stating that "the peace process is a kind of a show of the Burmese government to get international community support."[^39] She has criticized the lack of genuine women's participation despite agreements that 30% of peace process participants should be women—a quota that has not been realized in practice.[^40]

She has also expressed concerns about consultation processes within the Karen National Union (KNU), stating that if the KNU wanted to be transparent, it had to "consult with the people, and should give more time, otherwise it is just information without consultation."[^41] This criticism highlighted tensions between ethnic armed organizations and civil society groups regarding democratic participation and community ownership of peace processes.

### Criticism of the International Community

Naw K'nyaw Paw has not hesitated to criticize international actors for their inconsistent approach to human rights in Myanmar. She stated that the international community has its own agenda, and although democratic countries claim to put human rights first, "we all know human rights never come first."[^42] She has also discussed the silence of Aung San Suu Kyi regarding military abuses against ethnic minorities and the duplicity of the international community about human rights.[^43]

### Navigating Political Sensitivities

Working under both military rule and the brief democratic period presented unique challenges. Naw K'nyaw Paw expressed difficulty in criticizing government policy during the democratic government because speaking out led to accusations of supporting the military regime, even though she wanted the democratic government to fulfill its human rights obligations.[^44]

### Risks and Security Challenges

Her outspoken advocacy, particularly the KWO's condemnation of military violence against the Rohingya and documentation of sexual violence by military forces, has placed her at considerable personal risk. Living and working in conflict-affected areas and speaking truth to power requires constant navigation of security threats from military actors who view her documentation and advocacy work as threatening to their interests.

---

## Personal Life

Naw K'nyaw Paw's personal life has been profoundly shaped by displacement and the Karen struggle for self-determination. Born along the Salween River and raised as a refugee from age 11, she has spent most of her life in the liminal space between Thailand and Myanmar, never fully settled in either country.[^45] Today, her family is scattered across multiple continents—North America, Australia, and Europe—where they have found the peace that has eluded them in their homeland.[^46]

Despite receiving international recognition and numerous opportunities to resettle abroad, Naw K'nyaw Paw has chosen to remain on the Thai-Burma border, based in Mae Sariang, where she can continue serving her community.[^47] Her name, K'nyaw Paw, meaning "Karen Flower," has become symbolic of her role as a representative of Karen women's resilience and beauty in the face of adversity.[^48]

As a leader, she is known for her commitment to grassroots empowerment and capacity building. She has personally conducted numerous democracy, human rights, and women's rights trainings for KWO members, believing that sustainable change comes from building the capacity of local communities rather than imposing solutions from above.[^49]

Her leadership style emphasizes consultation, transparency, and collective decision-making—values she advocates for not only within KWO but also in broader peace processes. She has consistently argued that women must be meaningfully included in all decision-making processes, not as token participants but as genuine stakeholders with power to shape outcomes.[^50]

## Legacy

### Pioneer in Documenting Conflict-Related Sexual Violence

Naw K'nyaw Paw's most enduring legacy may be her role in breaking the silence around sexual violence in conflict. Under her leadership, KWO has systematically documented military sexual violence since 2004, creating an invaluable historical record of war crimes that would otherwise go unacknowledged. This documentation serves multiple purposes: providing evidence for potential future justice processes, validating survivors' experiences, and raising international awareness of sexual violence as a deliberate weapon of war.[^51][^52]

Her work has influenced other women's organizations in Myanmar and beyond to prioritize documentation of gender-based violence, creating a model for community-based human rights monitoring that centers survivors' voices.

### Advancing Women's Role in Peace Processes

Throughout her career, Naw K'nyaw Paw has been a tireless advocate for women's meaningful participation in peace processes. As a member of the Executive Committee of the Women's League of Burma, which comprises 12 ethnic women's organizations, she has helped build a powerful coalition that amplifies women's voices in national reconciliation efforts.[^53][^54]

Her advocacy has contributed to greater recognition—if not always realization—of the principle that women must be included in peace negotiations and post-conflict governance. She has demonstrated that women are not merely victims of conflict but crucial actors in building sustainable peace.

### Model of Solidarity Across Ethnic Lines

By courageously speaking out for Rohingya women in 2017 when few Myanmar civil society organizations were willing to do so, Naw K'nyaw Paw modeled a principled solidarity across ethnic lines. Her stance demonstrated that the struggle against military violence and human rights abuses transcends ethnic boundaries and that ethnic minority groups must stand together against oppression.[^55][^56]

This legacy of solidarity has important implications for Myanmar's future, offering a vision of cross-ethnic cooperation grounded in shared values of human rights and dignity rather than narrow ethnic nationalism.

### Building Institutional Capacity

Under her leadership, KWO has grown from a community-based organization to a sophisticated institution implementing 17 funded projects and serving over 140,000 beneficiaries annually.[^57] She has built systems for program management, monitoring and evaluation, financial accountability, and advocacy that will sustain the organization long after her tenure as General Secretary ends.

Her emphasis on youth leadership development, including establishing the KWO Emerging Leaders School, ensures that a new generation of Karen women leaders will continue the struggle for rights and justice.[^58]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and human rights advocates consistently praise Naw K'nyaw Paw as one of the most courageous and effective women's rights leaders in Southeast Asia. The World Bank, in a 2020 feature, highlighted her work "Breaking Barriers in Myanmar," noting her successful lobbying of Karen leadership to change discriminatory state laws that undermined women's rights.[^59]

International human rights organizations view her documentation of sexual violence as pioneering work that provides crucial evidence of systematic war crimes. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have relied on KWO's documentation in their own advocacy and reporting on Myanmar.[^60]

The U.S. State Department, in presenting her with the 2019 International Women of Courage Award, specifically noted that she and KWO have "documented sexual and gender-based violence in conflict in Burma since 2004" and emphasized that "in 2017, under her leadership, the KWO was the first, and one of the few, in Burma to publicly condemn the military-led violence against the Rohingya people."[^61]

Women's rights scholars point to her leadership as exemplifying the crucial role of women in conflict and post-conflict settings. Her work demonstrates that women are not passive victims but active agents of change who possess unique insights into the gendered dimensions of conflict and peace.

The Global Fund for Women recognized KWO under her leadership as a model organization protecting ethnic minorities during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that when the Myanmar government failed ethnic minorities, grassroots women's organizations like KWO filled the gap.[^62]

### Critical Perspectives

Some critics within Myanmar's activist community have questioned whether international recognition and awards inadvertently co-opt grassroots movements into elite international circuits, potentially diluting their radical potential. There are concerns that leaders who gain international prominence may become more accountable to international funders and audiences than to their base communities.

Others have raised questions about the effectiveness of documentation and advocacy strategies when they have not prevented ongoing violence. Despite decades of documenting military atrocities, the Burma Army continues to commit human rights abuses with impunity, leading some to question whether alternative strategies—including armed resistance—might be more effective.

Some voices within the Karen movement have debated whether civil society organizations should maintain strict neutrality or more explicitly align with ethnic armed organizations. Naw K'nyaw Paw's position as head of a civilian organization while working closely with the KNU-controlled areas creates ambiguities about the relationship between civilian and military structures.

Within refugee communities, there are ongoing debates about strategy and priorities. Some argue that more resources should focus on immediate humanitarian needs rather than documentation and advocacy work, particularly given the worsening humanitarian situation following the 2021 coup.

Nevertheless, even critics generally acknowledge Naw K'nyaw Paw's personal courage, integrity, and genuine commitment to her community. Disagreements tend to focus on strategic questions rather than questioning her motives or dedication.
