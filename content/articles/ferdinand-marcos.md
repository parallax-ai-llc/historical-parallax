## Summary

Ferdinand Edralin Marcos served as the tenth President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, becoming one of Southeast Asia's most controversial and longest-ruling leaders.[^1] Initially elected as a democratic leader promising reform and progress, Marcos declared martial law in 1972, establishing a dictatorship that lasted until 1986.[^2] His regime was marked by unprecedented infrastructure development, systematic human rights abuses, massive corruption, and the accumulation of billions in stolen wealth.[^3][^4] The People Power Revolution of 1986 forced him into exile in Hawaii, where he died three years later, leaving a deeply contested legacy that continues to shape Philippine politics today.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born on September 11, 1917, in Sarrat, a village in the Ilocos Norte region of the island of Luzon in the Philippines.[^6] His parents, Josefa Edralin and Mariano Marcos, were both teachers from important families.[^6] In 1925, Mariano Marcos became a congressman, surrounding the young Ferdinand in a political atmosphere at an early age.[^6] The family's political prominence provided Ferdinand with opportunities that would shape his ambitious personality and competitive drive.

Marcos received his primary education at Sarrat Elementary School in Ilocos Norte, Shamrock Elementary School in Laoag, and Ermita Elementary School in Manila from 1923 to 1929.[^6] When his father was elected to the Philippine Congress in 1925, the family moved to Manila, which provided Ferdinand with educational opportunities unavailable elsewhere.[^6] From 1929 to 1933, he studied at the University of the Philippines High School, demonstrating early academic excellence.[^6]

Mariano had a strong influence on what was to become Ferdinand's competitive, win-at-all-costs nature.[^6] Both parents pushed Ferdinand to excel at everything, not only his studies at school, but also at activities such as wrestling, boxing, hunting, survival skills, and marksmanship.[^6] This rigorous upbringing instilled in him a determination to succeed that would define his political career.

Following his high school graduation, Marcos was given a scholarship and enrolled in the liberal arts program at the University of the Philippines in Manila, where he studied law.[^6] He graduated cum laude in March 1939 with the President Quezon Award for his thesis.[^7] Marcos topped the Bar exams in 1939 with record-high scores, but could not immediately take his oath as a lawyer because of a pending murder case.[^7][^8]

The murder case stemmed from the killing of Julio Nalundasan, a political rival of his father who had defeated Mariano Marcos in the 1934 elections.[^9] Nalundasan was killed by a sniper at his home on September 20, 1935, just two days after being proclaimed the winner.[^9] Four years later, Ferdinand Marcos, his father, and two uncles were accused of conspiring to murder Nalundasan, with the younger Marcos, a national rifle champion, tagged as the gunman.[^9] On January 11, 1940, Marcos and his uncle Quirino Lizardo were convicted of murder.[^10] However, Marcos argued his case on appeal to the Philippine Supreme Court and won acquittal on October 22, 1940, through a decision by then-Associate Justice Jose P. Laurel.[^11] This early controversy foreshadowed the legal and ethical questions that would follow him throughout his career.

## Rise to Power

After World War II, Marcos embarked on a legal career, becoming one of eleven lawyers to act as a special prosecutor tasked to try by "process of law and justice" all those accused of collaboration with the Japanese.[^7] His wartime record became a source of enduring controversy. Marcos claimed to have led a guerrilla force called Ang Mahárlika in northern Luzon during World War II with a strength of 9,000 men, and asserted he was the "most decorated war hero of the Philippines" with 33 war medals and decorations, including the Distinguished Service Cross and the Medal of Honor.[^12][^13]

However, research by historian Alfred W. McCoy into United States Army records in 1986 showed most of Marcos's medals to be fraudulent.[^13] The Ang Manga Maharlika unit was not among the guerrilla units recognized by U.S. Army headquarters, and between 1945 and 1948, various Army officers rejected Marcos's two requests for official recognition of the guerrilla unit, calling his claims distorted, exaggerated, fraudulent, contradictory, and absurd.[^13] A 2016 report by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines, the University of the Philippines' Third World Studies Center, and The Washington Post confirmed there was no official U.S. government record supporting claims about Marcos receiving medals from the U.S. Armed Forces.[^12]

Despite these controversies, Marcos successfully launched his political career. In 1949, he ran for his father's old post as representative of the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte and won three consecutive terms, serving in the House of Representatives from 1949 to 1959.[^14] He became the Liberal Party's economic spokesman and chaired the House Neophytes Bloc, which included future president Diosdado Macapagal, future vice president Emmanuel Pelaez, and future Manila Mayor Arsenio Lacson.[^14]

In 1954, Marcos met Imelda Romualdez, who had been declared the "Muse of Manila."[^15] Their courtship lasted only eleven days, and they married on May 1, 1954.[^15] At the time, Ferdinand was a 36-year-old congressman, and Imelda would become his most important political partner.[^15] The couple had three children: daughter Imee (1955), son Ferdinand Jr., nicknamed "Bongbong" (1957), and daughter Irene (1960).[^15]

After serving three terms in the House, Marcos won a Senate seat in 1959 and became Senate minority floor leader in 1960.[^14] He became executive vice president of the Liberal Party and served as party president from 1961 to 1964.[^14] From 1963 to 1965, he was Senate President, establishing a record for having introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the Republic statute books.[^14]

When incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal decided to run for a second term, blocking Marcos's ambitions within the Liberal Party, Marcos switched to the Nacionalista Party and secured its presidential nomination.[^16] The 1965 Philippine presidential election was held on November 9, 1965, with Marcos winning 51.94% of the vote against Macapagal's 42.88%.[^17] Ferdinand Marcos was inaugurated as the tenth president of the Philippines on December 30, 1965.[^17]

## Major Achievements

During his first term as president, Marcos launched an ambitious infrastructure development program that transformed the Philippine landscape. The government built up infrastructure faster and more thoroughly than any other administration before, with output of roads, bridges, irrigation dams, airports, and other infrastructure projects exceeding by several hundred percent the total accomplishments of preceding administrations.[^18] Between 1965 and 1972, 515 kilometers were paved with concrete and 903 kilometers with asphalt; 3,167 kilometers of feeder roads were constructed and 7,685 lineal meters of temporary bridges were replaced by permanent steel and reinforced concrete structures.[^18]

Major infrastructure projects included the Cultural Center of the Philippines complex, considered one of the earliest examples of the Marcoses' building program.[^18] The North Diversion Road, now known as the North Luzon Expressway, was constructed from Balintawak to Tabang, Guiguinto, Bulacan, with help from the Armed Forces engineering construction battalion.[^18] The Manila North and South Diversion Roads connected the capital to surrounding provinces, facilitating trade and commerce.[^18] The Philippine Heart Center in Quezon City was established through Presidential Decree No. 673 in 1975, and the Lung Center of the Philippines was established on January 16, 1981, under Presidential Decree No. 1823.[^18]

Marcos's agrarian reform program, particularly Presidential Decree 27 (PD 27), was considered revolutionary for its time. Signed shortly after the declaration of martial law, PD 27 abolished sharecropping in rice and corn lands and introduced the concept of land ownership to peasants.[^19] This was considered a novelty, as for the first time, large numbers of peasants could now own the lands they tilled.[^19] The decree was connected to the Green Revolution, as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) at the University of the Philippines Los Baños had developed "miracle seeds" such as IR-8, IR-15, and IR-20.[^20]

The regime launched the Masagana 99 program, which sought widespread use of IRRI's high-yielding varieties and patronage of government lending programs.[^21] Income transfers from landlords to former tenants were significant, especially as the land reform implementation coincided with substantial yield increases due to the introduction of high yielding varieties, irrigation investment, and modern inputs during the 1970s.[^21] However, the reform was limited in scope, covering only rice and corn lands that were tenanted and privately-owned, while excluding export crops like bananas, sugar, and coconuts that were top dollar earners.[^20]

Marcos promoted his vision of a "New Society" or Bagong Lipunan, which he claimed would free every individual Filipino to fulfill their potential as human beings, no longer living in poverty, hunger, corruption, mass deception, and violence.[^22] According to his book Notes on the New Society, his movement urged the poor and the privileged to work as one for the common goals of society and to achieve the liberation of the Filipino people through self-realization.[^22] The Kilusang Bagong Lipunan was formed in 1978 as his political vehicle, emphasizing national unity, development, and strong leadership.[^23]

## Controversies and Criticisms

On September 21, 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081, placing the Philippines under martial law, though he did not announce it publicly until September 23.[^24] Marcos justified martial law by claiming it was the last defense against rising disorder caused by increasingly violent student demonstrations, alleged threats of communist insurgency by the new Communist Party of the Philippines, and the Muslim separatist movement of the Moro National Liberation Front.[^24] Notably, an ambush on Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile was later revealed by Enrile himself in 1986 to have been staged by Marcos to justify martial law.[^24]

This marked the beginning of a 14-year period of one-man rule that would effectively last until Marcos was exiled from the country on February 25, 1986.[^24] Ruling as a dictator under martial law from 1972 to 1981, he granted himself expanded powers under the 1973 Constitution, describing his philosophy as "constitutional authoritarianism."[^24] Based on documentation from Amnesty International, Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, and similar human rights monitoring entities, historians believe that the Marcos dictatorship was marked by 3,257 known extrajudicial killings, 35,000 documented tortures, 737 enforced disappearances, and 70,000 incarcerations.[^25]

Some 2,520 of the 3,257 murder victims were tortured and mutilated before their bodies were dumped in various places in a tactic known as "salvaging," meant to instill public fear.[^26] Methods of torture included electric shock, waterboarding, beatings, and psychological torture.[^26] Units that became particularly notorious for human rights violations were the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP), the Metrocom Intelligence and Security Group (MISG), and the 5th Constabulary Security Unit (5CSU).[^26] Amnesty International's 1975 report revealed "systematic and severe torture" by the Fifth Constabulary Security Unit.[^26]

Marcos initially denied knowledge of violations, proclaiming in 1974 that "No one, but no one was tortured," but eventually confessed at the 1977 World Peace through Law Conference that there had been "a number of violations of the rights of detainees."[^27] In 1995, some 10,000 Filipinos won a US class-action lawsuit filed against the Marcos estate for claims filed by victims or their surviving relatives consequent on torture, execution, and disappearances.[^27]

The corruption under the Marcos regime was staggering in its scale and systematic nature. Transparency International estimates that the Marcoses embezzled $5 billion to $10 billion over the 20 years they were in power.[^28] The Guinness World Records gave the Marcos spouses a title for the "greatest robbery of a government," where national loss from graft and corruption amounted to 5-10 billion US dollars.[^25] Other estimates of the family's hidden wealth range from $10 billion to $30 billion, siphoned from public coffers into Swiss banks, offshore accounts, New York penthouses, and Imelda's infamous jewelry collection.[^29]

Documents recovered when the Marcos family fled Manila in 1986 revealed the existence of secret bank accounts in Switzerland, including an account opened with Credit Suisse in Zurich under false identities—"William Saunders" for Ferdinand Marcos and "Jane Ryan" for Imelda Marcos in 1968.[^30] Despite a presidential salary of only around $5,600 at the time, his Swiss bank account had a balance of $950,000.[^30] On December 21, 1990, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court affirmed a prosecutor's findings that the Marcoses hid $356 million in Swiss banks through dubious foundations during their two-decade rule.[^31]

Marcos established a system of crony capitalism, granting monopolies to close associates who enriched themselves at the expense of ordinary Filipinos. Eduardo Cojuangco received a monopoly over the coconut industry through Unicom, a coconut refining and exporting company, and controlled about $1.5 billion in assets at the height of Marcos's power.[^32] The coconut levy scheme taxed small farmers with the promise of shares in the coconut investment company, but farmers benefitted nothing from this levy, which became extremely profitable, amounting to as much as $785 million in total profits.[^33]

Roberto Benedicto, Marcos's former classmate and fraternity brother, was appointed head of the Philippine Sugar Commission in 1974, granting him monopoly over exports and pricing.[^34] At the prime of his career, Benedicto's empire consisted of 85 corporations, 106 sugar farms, 14 haciendas, other agricultural lands, and 17 radio stations, with a net worth estimated at $800 million in 1983.[^35] Under these monopolies, farmers were obliged to sell only to the monopolists and received less than world prices for their crops, with millions of dollars in profits diverted overseas into Swiss bank accounts.[^36]

Most of Marcos's infrastructure projects were funded by loans that increased the country's foreign deficit from $360 million when Marcos came into power in 1965 to around $28.3 billion when he stepped down in 1986.[^37] Economist Emmanuel de Dios and colleagues wrote in 1984 that the bulk of construction projects were "not very productive and many were outrightly wasteful."[^37]

The assassination of Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr. on August 21, 1983, marked a turning point in opposition to the Marcos regime. Aquino, a former Philippine senator and longtime opponent of Marcos, was shot in the head on the tarmac of Manila International Airport as he returned from three years of self-imposed exile in the United States.[^38] In 1972, shortly after martial law was declared, Aquino had been imprisoned on falsified charges and was only released in 1980 when he suffered a heart attack.[^38] An independent commission concluded in October 1984 that a military conspiracy led by the Philippine armed forces chief of staff, General Fabian C. Ver, was responsible for the assassination.[^39] Aquino's assassination transformed the isolated opposition to Marcos into a national crusade and thrust Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, into the political spotlight.[^40]

## Personal Life

Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos's marriage became synonymous with what critics called a "conjugal dictatorship." Their courtship in 1954 lasted only eleven days before they married on May 1, 1954.[^15] At the time of their marriage, Ferdinand was a 36-year-old congressman, while Imelda had been declared the "Muse of Manila."[^15] Before marrying Imelda, Ferdinand lived with a common-law wife, Carmen Ortega, an Ilocana mestiza who was 1949 Miss Press Photography, with whom he had three children and resided for about two years at 204 Ortega Street in San Juan.[^41]

The Marcos couple had three children who would all play significant roles in Philippine politics and society. Daughter Imee, born in 1955, became a politician and later served as a senator. Son Ferdinand Jr., nicknamed "Bongbong," born in 1957, followed in his father's footsteps and was elected president of the Philippines in 2022. Daughter Irene, born in 1960, maintained a lower public profile than her siblings.[^15]

Imelda wielded significant political power after her husband placed the country under martial law in September 1972.[^15] With Marcos ailing in his later years, Imelda emerged as the government's main public figure.[^15] She was made infamous by excesses that characterized the couple's rule, including her legendary shoe collection. While reports vary, the Presidential Commission on Good Government confirmed to media that approximately 3,000 pairs of shoes were discovered when the Marcos family fled, though Imelda herself claimed she only had 1,060 pairs.[^42] The collection ranged from locally made Marlet Shoes priced at $6-11 to imported designer pairs costing up to $100 or more.[^43]

Imelda's lavish lifestyle extended far beyond shoes. Her wardrobe also included 15 mink coats, 508 gowns, 888 handbags, and even a bulletproof bra.[^44] She ordered the construction of many grandiose architectural projects using public funds, including cultural centers and government buildings that became symbols of the regime's excesses.[^44] The couple stole billions of pesos from the Filipino people, amassing a personal fortune estimated to have been worth $5 billion to $10 billion by the time they were deposed in 1986.[^44]

Marcos was known for his intellectual pretensions and rhetorical skills. He authored several books, including Notes on the New Society of the Philippines, and was famous for his lengthy speeches and public addresses. His personality was marked by the competitive, win-at-all-costs nature instilled by his father, combined with considerable charisma and political cunning that enabled him to maintain power for over two decades.

## Legacy

Ferdinand Marcos died at St. Francis Medical Center in Honolulu at 12:40 a.m. (HST) on September 28, 1989, of kidney, heart, and lung ailments, seventeen days after his 72nd birthday.[^45] He had been admitted to the hospital on January 15, 1989, with pneumonia and underwent a series of operations.[^45] President Corazon Aquino, who became president following the People Power Revolution in 1986, did not allow Marcos's body to be flown back to the Philippines for burial.[^46] Unable to return to the Philippines due to the government ban, Marcos's body was interred on October 15, 1989, in a private mausoleum at the Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in Hawaii.[^47]

It was not until September 7, 1993, that the body of Ferdinand Marcos was flown into the Philippines, traveling from Hawaii to Guam and then to Laoag in Ilocos Norte.[^48] From 1993 to 2016, Marcos's body was publicly displayed in his hometown in Ilocos Norte, a province located in northern Philippines.[^48] The burial of Marcos with military honors was conducted in a private ceremony on November 18, 2016, at the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Heroes' Cemetery), resulting in nationwide protests by groups, sectors, and personalities opposing the burial of Marcos at the state cemetery.[^49]

The Philippine government's efforts to recover stolen wealth have been extensive but challenging. In 2003, the Supreme Court ordered the transfer to the Philippine government of the Marcoses' Swiss bank accounts worth $658 million.[^50] The Philippines government accused Marcos and his relatives of plundering up to $10 billion and had recovered about $4 billion as of 2013.[^50] Since its inception in 1986 until 2015, the Presidential Commission on Good Governance recovered more than P170 billion (over $3 billion in current peso-dollar exchange rates) of the Marcoses' ill-gotten wealth.[^51]

Because of the Marcos Swiss bank account scandals where aliases, fictional names, or nominees were shown to have been tolerated by Swiss banking authorities, anti-money laundering rules were sanctioned for the first time.[^52] This represented one of the few positive outcomes of the scandal, as it led to international banking reforms.

The Philippine Congress passed the Human Rights Victims Reparation and Recognition Act of 2013, which provided reparations to victims of summary execution, torture, enforced disappearances, and other human rights violations, with compensation coming from P10 billion of stolen wealth seized from the Marcoses, benefiting 11,103 victims by 2018.[^53]

Marcos's legacy in Philippine infrastructure remains visible but contested. The roads, bridges, hospitals, and cultural institutions built during his regime continue to serve the nation, yet they were constructed at enormous financial cost through foreign loans that burdened succeeding generations. The debt-driven development model he pursued left the Philippines in economic crisis, with the national debt growing from $360 million in 1965 to $28.3 billion in 1986.[^37]

The political legacy is equally complex. His son, Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr., was elected president in May 2022, receiving around 59 percent of the votes.[^54] This remarkable political comeback reflects the enduring influence of the Marcos name in certain regions, particularly in the family's home base of Ilocos Norte, as well as successful historical revisionism that has softened perceptions of the dictatorship among younger Filipinos who did not experience martial law firsthand.[^54]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some economic analyses have presented a surprisingly favorable assessment of Marcos's economic record. One study concluded that "the balance sheet is very positive," arguing that many problems continuing to affect the nation today resulted from decisions taken during the transition from Marcos by the successor government.[^55] During his period of rule, there were major reforms in government organization, in the provision of public infrastructure, and in social and economic development.[^55]

Supporters point to the infrastructure development that occurred during his presidency as evidence of effective governance. The roads, bridges, hospitals, schools, and cultural institutions built during his administration provided tangible benefits to many Filipinos. The Cultural Center of the Philippines, Philippine Heart Center, Lung Center of the Philippines, and the expansion of transportation networks are cited as lasting contributions to national development.[^18]

Defenders of Marcos's agrarian reform program note that Presidential Decree 27 was genuinely revolutionary in abolishing sharecropping and providing land ownership to tenants in rice and corn lands. The income transfers from landlords to former tenants represented a significant redistribution of wealth, particularly when combined with the productivity gains from the Green Revolution's high-yielding rice varieties.[^21] The Masagana 99 program helped the Philippines achieve temporary rice self-sufficiency in the late 1970s.

Using time series data on public opinion about Marcos post-ouster, researchers found that a generally positive appreciation of Marcos as former president had crystallized early on across nearly all major variables.[^54] This persistent positive sentiment, particularly in rural areas and his home region, suggests that some Filipinos genuinely benefited from or appreciated aspects of his governance, whether through infrastructure development, agricultural programs, or the perception of strong, decisive leadership.

Some supporters argue that Marcos faced genuine security threats from communist insurgency and Muslim separatism, and that extraordinary measures were necessary to maintain national unity and order. They contend that martial law, while excessive in retrospect, was implemented with sincere motivations to reform Philippine society and address systemic problems of corruption, criminality, and social disorder that predated his presidency.

The New Society ideology, despite its authoritarian implementation, articulated aspirations for national development, social justice, and Filipino self-determination that resonated with some segments of the population. Marcos's nationalist rhetoric and his challenge to traditional oligarchic power structures appealed to those who saw him as championing the interests of ordinary Filipinos against entrenched elites.

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among historians, human rights organizations, and international observers is that the Marcos regime was a brutal dictatorship characterized by systematic human rights abuses, kleptocracy, and the destruction of democratic institutions. Scholars have referred to the era as "constitutional authoritarianism" and described it as a kleptocracy that operated at the expense of the poor and powerless.[^53]

The documented scale of human rights abuses is staggering and indisputable. Based on documentation from Amnesty International, Task Force Detainees of the Philippines, and similar monitoring entities, the Marcos dictatorship was responsible for 3,257 known extrajudicial killings, 35,000 documented tortures, 737 enforced disappearances, and 70,000 incarcerations.[^25] These are not allegations but documented facts supported by court proceedings, including the successful class-action lawsuit filed by 10,000 Filipino victims in U.S. courts.[^27]

The economic devastation left by Marcos is equally well-documented. While infrastructure was built, it was financed through reckless borrowing that increased the national debt from $360 million to $28.3 billion.[^37] Economist Emmanuel de Dios noted that the bulk of construction projects were "not very productive and many were outrightly wasteful."[^37] The system of crony capitalism enriched a small circle of Marcos associates while impoverishing millions of Filipinos, particularly farmers who were exploited by the coconut and sugar monopolies.[^36]

The Marcos regime's corruption was on a scale that earned recognition from the Guinness World Records as the "greatest robbery of a government."[^25] The embezzlement of $5-10 billion from public funds, the secret Swiss bank accounts under false names, and the systematic plunder of state resources represent one of history's most brazen examples of kleptocracy.[^28][^30] The anti-money laundering reforms that resulted from exposing these scandals are perhaps the only positive international legacy of Marcos's financial crimes.[^52]

Critics emphasize that whatever infrastructure was built came at the cost of democratic freedoms, human dignity, and economic sovereignty. The martial law period silenced opposition through violence and intimidation, closed independent media outlets, arrested dissidents without due process, and created a climate of fear that pervaded Philippine society. The assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. in 1983, widely believed to have been ordered by the Marcos regime despite official denials, demonstrated the lengths to which the dictatorship would go to eliminate opposition.[^39]

The fraudulent claims about his World War II record, exposed through U.S. military archives, reveal a pattern of deception that characterized Marcos's entire career.[^13] His medals were fake, his guerrilla unit was never recognized, and his claims of heroism were fabricated—yet he built his political image on these lies and even had himself buried with military honors.[^49]

Human rights advocates and victims' families continue to fight against historical revisionism that attempts to rehabilitate Marcos's image. The election of his son as president in 2022 has been viewed with alarm by those who remember the brutality of martial law and fear that the return of the Marcos family to power represents a dangerous erasure of historical memory and accountability.[^54]
