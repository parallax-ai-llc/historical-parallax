## Early Life and Background

Mary Louise Streep was born on June 22, 1949, in Summit, New Jersey, to Mary Wolf Wilkinson, a commercial artist, and Harry William Streep Jr., a pharmaceutical executive.[^4] Her father was of German and Swiss-German descent, while her mother had English, Irish, and German ancestry.[^5] Raised in the affluent town of Bernardsville, New Jersey, young Meryl showed early promise in both academics and the performing arts.

As a child, Streep's initial ambitions leaned toward opera rather than acting. She began voice training at age twelve, developing the vocal control that would later become one of her signature strengths as an actress.[^6] During high school, she was not only academically accomplished but also a varsity cheerleader and Homecoming Queen, embodying the image of the all-American girl.[^7] Despite appearing in numerous school plays, she remained largely uninterested in serious theater until a transformative experience at Vassar College.

While studying at Vassar College in 1969, Streep's performance in August Strindberg's play *Miss Julie* captured attention across campus and ignited her passion for acting.[^8] She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Drama, graduating cum laude in 1971.[^9] Recognizing her calling, she applied to the Yale School of Drama, one of the most prestigious theater programs in the United States. At Yale, she supplemented her course fees by working as a waitress and typist while immersing herself in theatrical training.[^10] During her time at the Yale Repertory Theater, she appeared in more than three dozen productions, quickly gaining recognition for her astounding range and the intensity of her performances.[^11] She worked under renowned instructors including Robert Lewis, a co-founder of the Actors Studio, who helped shape her technical approach to acting.[^12] At one point, the workload became so overwhelming that she developed ulcers and briefly contemplated quitting acting to study law, but her passion ultimately prevailed.[^13] Streep earned her Master of Fine Arts degree in 1975, poised to begin what would become one of the most illustrious careers in acting history.

## Rise to Prominence

Upon graduating from Yale in 1975, Streep immediately began building her professional career. One of her first engagements was at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference, where she acted in five plays over six weeks.[^14] She then moved to New York City, where legendary theater producer Joseph Papp cast her in a production of *Trelawny of the Wells* at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, opposite Mandy Patinkin and John Lithgow, marking her Broadway debut.[^15]

Streep's Broadway career flourished rapidly. In 1976, she appeared in a double bill of Tennessee Williams' *27 Wagons Full of Cotton* and Arthur Miller's *A Memory of Two Mondays*, earning a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play.[^16] She continued to garner critical acclaim in Anton Chekhov's *The Cherry Orchard* and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical *Happy End*, receiving Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.[^17] Industry insiders quickly recognized her as "the fastest rising star in the Broadway firmament."[^18]

It was during her theater work that Streep's path to film stardom began. Director Michael Cimino saw her in a production of *Happy End* on Broadway and hired her almost immediately to play Linda in *The Deer Hunter*.[^19] Robert De Niro had also spotted her in *The Cherry Orchard* and recommended her for the role of his girlfriend in the film.[^20] During the filming of *The Deer Hunter* in 1977, Streep faced immense personal tragedy. She had met actor John Cazale in 1976 while performing in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of *Measure for Measure*, and the two began a deeply devoted relationship.[^21] Cazale, fourteen years her senior, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 1977.[^22] Despite being virtually uninsurable due to his illness, Cazale continued working on *The Deer Hunter*, with costs reportedly paid by Robert De Niro who wanted his friend in the film.[^23] Streep remained at Cazale's side throughout his illness, demonstrating extraordinary devotion. Al Pacino, Cazale's close friend and *Godfather* co-star, said: "I've hardly ever seen a person so devoted to someone who is falling away like John was. To see her in that act of love for this man was overwhelming."[^24] Cazale died on March 13, 1978, at age 42, with Streep at his bedside.[^25]

Six months after Cazale's death, Streep married sculptor Don Gummer in 1978.[^26] *The Deer Hunter* was released in December 1978 and became an immediate success, winning five Academy Awards and earning Streep her first Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[^27] That same year, she also played a supporting role in Woody Allen's *Manhattan* (1979) as a former girlfriend turned lesbian.[^28] Her film career had begun in earnest, and Hollywood took notice of the extraordinary talent emerging from the New York theater world.

## Major Achievements

Meryl Streep's film career represents an unparalleled achievement in cinema history. Her first Academy Award came in 1980 for Best Supporting Actress in *Kramer vs. Kramer* (1979), where she portrayed a troubled wife opposite Dustin Hoffman.[^29] Just three years later, she won the Oscar for Best Actress for her devastating performance as a Holocaust survivor in *Sophie's Choice* (1982), a role that required her to master both Polish and German accents.[^30] This performance became a defining moment in film history, showcasing her ability to inhabit complex characters with profound emotional authenticity.

Throughout the 1980s and beyond, Streep continued to set standards few could match, primarily through her extraordinary mastery of accents—including Polish, Danish, and Australian—in films like *Silkwood* (1983), *Out of Africa* (1985), and *A Cry in the Dark* (1988).[^31] For *Out of Africa*, she portrayed Danish author Karen Blixen, mastering the Danish accent herself, though the performance drew mixed reactions.[^32] Some reviewers found her accent "perfect and quite convincing," while Danish television viewers phoned in to critique its alleged inaccuracies.[^33]

Her filmography includes numerous critically acclaimed and commercially successful works: *Julia* (1977), *The French Lieutenant's Woman* (1981), *Postcards from the Edge* (1990), *The Bridges of Madison County* (1995), *Adaptation* (2002), *The Devil Wears Prada* (2006), *Doubt* (2008), *Mamma Mia!* (2008), *Little Women* (2019), and *Let Them All Talk* (2020).[^34] *The Devil Wears Prada*, in which she played the formidable fashion editor Miranda Priestly, grossed over $326 million worldwide and earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy.[^35] The role became iconic, though Streep later revealed the experience of method acting for the film made her "so miserable" that she never used the technique again.[^36]

In 2011, Streep delivered another transformative performance as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in *The Iron Lady*, making "the umpteenth extraordinary transformation of her career, uncannily inhabiting the facial expressions and vocal stylings of the former British prime minister."[^37] Working under extensive makeup to age herself and meticulously capturing Thatcher's voice, poise, and body language, Streep explained: "There is a point in the process where I don't distinguish between whether I'm doing her or I'm being me. I feel like me and I sound like her."[^38] The performance earned her third Academy Award.[^39]

Streep's record-breaking achievement came through her nominations rather than just her wins. With 21 Academy Award nominations (17 for Best Actress and four for Best Supporting Actress), she stands alone as the most Oscar-nominated performer in history.[^40] In 2009, she became the most-nominated performer in Golden Globe history, eventually accumulating 30 nominations and winning eight times.[^41] She is one of only three performers to win three Academy Awards across both acting categories, joining Ingrid Bergman and Jack Nicholson.[^42]

Beyond film awards, her honors include the National Medal of Arts (2010), a Kennedy Center Honor (2011), the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama (2014), the Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement (2017), and the Honorary Palme d'Or at Cannes Film Festival (2024).[^43]

Streep's acting technique has been the subject of extensive scholarly analysis. She is associated with method acting, utilizing techniques in roles like *Kramer vs. Kramer*, *The Iron Lady*, and *Sophie's Choice*.[^44] However, unlike method actors who remain in character continuously, she slips in and out of character "like a seasoned professional."[^45] Her approach centers on finding the "affective memory"—identifying similarities between herself and the character rather than treating them as completely different people.[^46] She sees herself as "a translator, explaining people to each other," drawn to characters who are difficult for others to understand.[^47] Notably, she has cultivated a deliberate reluctance to analyze her own working method, fearing that "if she parses it, she won't be able to do it anymore."[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her legendary status, Meryl Streep has faced significant controversies and criticisms, particularly regarding her political activism and statements on diversity. The most prominent controversy emerged from her 2017 Golden Globes acceptance speech for the Cecil B. DeMille Award. In the speech, she delivered an excoriating critique of President-elect Donald Trump without mentioning him by name, referencing an incident where Trump allegedly mocked a disabled New York Times reporter during a campaign rally.[^49] She stated: "And this instinct to humiliate, when it's modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody's life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing."[^50]

The speech prompted an immediate response from Trump, who attacked her on Twitter, calling the three-time Oscar winner "one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood" and a "Hillary flunky who lost big."[^51] Trump also denied mocking the reporter, as he had done previously.[^52] While Streep's speech drew enthusiastic praise from many, it also attracted sharp criticism from multiple perspectives. Conservative outlets compiled lists of her "dumbest political comments," while left-wing publication *Jacobin* published an article titled "Against Meryl Streep," arguing that her outrage stemmed from "a two-party-tinted worldview rooted not in principle, but in empowering equally repugnant politicians who happen to share her ideology."[^53]

Critics also pointed to what they saw as elite disconnection in her remarks. In the speech, Streep said: "All of us in this room, really, belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now. Think about it: Hollywood, foreigners, and the press."[^54] Commentators described this as "a highlight reel of liberals' worst assumptions about power," with wealthy celebrities claiming victim status.[^55] Streep herself later expressed ambivalence about her political role, saying: "I don't want to be that. I don't want to be that... I'm a really private person, and like a lot of people in show business, I'm actually shy so it's hard for me to do all this stuff."[^56]

Another major controversy involved her response to the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse scandal. When pressed by a New York Times reporter about people "waiting" for her to speak out about Weinstein, Streep deflected attention to the Trump family, saying: "I did not know about Weinstein's crimes... I don't want to hear about the silence of me. I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump," demanding that Ivanka Trump speak out.[^57] This response was widely criticized as deflection and whataboutism.

Streep has also faced criticism over diversity issues. At the 2016 Berlin International Film Festival, where she served as jury president, she and her fellow jurors—a panel consisting of seven white people—fielded questions about diversity in the film industry.[^58] When asked about the importance of understanding different cultures for judging films, Streep responded that "we're all Africans really," a comment that drew widespread mockery and accusations of racial insensitivity.[^59] The Daily Beast published an article titled "Meryl Streep's Divisive Feminism: How White Feminists Silence People of Color," critiquing her approach to feminism as exclusionary.[^60]

Her stance on feminism itself has been controversial. In a 2015 interview with Time Out London, when asked if she was a feminist, Streep replied: "I am a humanist, I am for nice easy balance," distancing herself from the feminist label.[^61] This prompted significant backlash, with outlets like Jezebel publishing articles with titles like "Meryl Streep Is a 'Humanist' Not a Feminist So I Guess Words Don't Have Meaning Anymore."[^62] However, in a subsequent BBC interview, Streep threw her hands up and said "of course!" when asked if she was a feminist, creating further confusion about her position.[^63]

## Personal Life

Meryl Streep married American sculptor Don Gummer on September 30, 1978, six months after the death of her partner John Cazale.[^64] Gummer creates abstract contemporary artworks and maintained a relatively low profile throughout their marriage.[^65] Together they had four children: musician Henry Wolfe Gummer (born 1979), and actresses Mary Willa "Mamie" Gummer (born 1983), Grace Jane Gummer (born 1986), and Louisa Jacobson Gummer (born 1991).[^66]

All four children have pursued careers in the arts. Henry Wolfe is married to Tamryn, and the couple have two children: daughter Ida June Gummer (born 2020) and son Quinn William Gummer (born 2022), making Streep a grandmother.[^67] Mamie Gummer tied the knot with Mehar Sethi in 2019 and they share one son; she was previously married to actor Ben Walker from 2011 to 2013.[^68] Grace Gummer married music producer Mark Ronson in August 2021, and the couple share a daughter; she was previously married to Tay Strathairn in 2019, divorcing one year later.[^69] Louisa Jacobson, the youngest, is best known for playing Marian Brook on the HBO series *The Gilded Age*.[^70]

In October 2023, a representative for Streep revealed that she and Gummer had been quietly separated for more than six years, stating: "While they will always care for each other, they have chosen lives apart."[^71] The announcement surprised many, as the couple had maintained an intensely private relationship and rarely discussed their personal lives publicly.

Throughout her career, Streep has maintained a reputation for being intensely private, describing herself as "a really private person" and "actually shy."[^72] This desire for privacy has persisted despite her status as one of the world's most famous actresses. She has also been characterized by colleagues and friends as possessing remarkable empathy and curiosity about people—qualities that have informed her approach to acting. As she once said: "I'm curious about other people. That's the essence of my acting. I'm interested in what it would be like to be you."[^73]

## Legacy

Meryl Streep's legacy extends far beyond her unprecedented collection of awards and nominations. She has fundamentally transformed expectations for what actors—particularly actresses—can achieve in terms of range, longevity, and artistic excellence. Her ability to master diverse accents and inhabit characters from vastly different backgrounds has set a standard that few have matched. From a Danish baroness to a British prime minister, from a Polish Holocaust survivor to an American fashion editor, Streep has demonstrated an almost chameleon-like versatility that has redefined the possibilities of film acting.

Her impact on the representation of women in film has been profound, though not without complexity. Throughout her five-decade career, she has portrayed women of depth, intelligence, and moral complexity at a time when Hollywood often relegated actresses to limited roles. She has continued to secure leading roles well into her seventies, challenging age discrimination in an industry notorious for sidelining older actresses. Yet she has acknowledged the persistent inequality, noting that despite her 19 Oscar nominations and three Academy Awards at the time of her comment, she has not been paid as highly as her male counterparts, asserting simply: "We have to be made equal."[^74]

Streep's activism has become an integral part of her legacy. In June and September 2015, she wrote to every member of Congress urging support for the Equal Rights Amendment, sending packages with materials advocating for gender equality.[^75] She co-founded "Mothers & Others For A Liveable Planet" in 1989 to raise awareness about pesticides being used on vegetables, demonstrating her commitment to environmental causes long before such activism became commonplace in Hollywood.[^76] More recently, she has advocated for Afghan women's rights, joining former Afghan MP Fawzia Koofi and Afghanistan's first female governor, Habiba Sarabi, to discuss the fight for women's rights in Afghanistan.[^77]

Her influence on subsequent generations of actors is immeasurable. Countless performers cite her as an inspiration, and her commitment to the craft has elevated standards across the industry. Emily Blunt credited Streep with changing her acting technique during the filming of *The Devil Wears Prada*.[^78] The phrase "the Meryl Streep of..." has entered common usage as shorthand for the absolute best practitioner in any field, a testament to how thoroughly her name has become synonymous with excellence.

The longevity of Streep's career itself represents a remarkable achievement. While many actors experience brief periods of acclaim, she has maintained the highest level of artistic achievement for over forty-five years, continuously evolving and taking on new challenges. Her willingness to appear in both prestige dramas and commercial entertainments like *Mamma Mia!* has demonstrated that artistic integrity and popular success need not be mutually exclusive.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Film scholars and critics widely regard Meryl Streep as the greatest film actress of her generation, with some arguing she may be the finest screen actor of all time regardless of gender. Her technical mastery—particularly her ability to adopt authentic-sounding accents and embody characters from diverse backgrounds—has been analyzed in academic studies and acting schools worldwide. The British acting coach Brian Timoney describes her as a "method acting legend," noting how she employs techniques of affective memory and emotional authenticity to create performances of extraordinary depth.[^79]

Andrew Szanton, writing in Medium, analyzed "the craft of acting" through Streep's work, emphasizing her philosophy that acting is "not about being someone different. It's finding the similarity in what is apparently different, then finding myself in there."[^80] This approach demonstrates intellectual sophistication in her understanding of human nature and empathy as the foundation of great acting.

Critics have consistently praised her willingness to take risks and avoid typecasting. Unlike many stars who repeatedly play variations of the same character, Streep has portrayed an astonishing range of personalities, ages, and nationalities. Roger Ebert wrote that "Meryl Streep upstages" the film in *The Iron Lady*, with her performance being "phenomenal" even when the screenplay itself was deemed lacking.[^81] This pattern—of Streep elevating material through the sheer force of her talent—has recurred throughout her career.

Her activism has also earned praise from advocacy organizations. The National Women's History Museum honored her not only for her artistic achievements but for using "her name and voice to support various causes including gender and pay equality (long before it was fashionable)."[^82] Supporters view her political speeches, particularly the 2017 Golden Globes address, as a courageous use of her platform to defend democratic values and press freedom. As Global Citizen noted, her speech "perfectly captures the mood of 48.2% of America" who opposed Trump's election.[^83]

Defenders of Streep argue that criticisms of her activism often stem from those who disagree with her politics rather than legitimate concerns about her methods. They point to her decades of quieter activism—environmental advocacy, support for the arts, and championing women's equality—as evidence of genuine commitment rather than performative politics.

### Negative Views

Critics from various political perspectives have challenged Streep's legacy, particularly regarding her political activism and statements on diversity. Conservative commentators view her political speeches as examples of Hollywood elitism and hypocrisy. Breitbart compiled a list of what it termed her "5 Dumbest Political Comments," arguing that she demonstrates a disconnect from ordinary Americans while claiming to speak for the marginalized.[^84] Fox News has extensively covered what it describes as her "politically charged comments," framing them as inappropriate uses of entertainment platforms for partisan messaging.[^85]

From the left, critics have been equally harsh. The socialist magazine *Jacobin* published "Against Meryl Streep," arguing that her 2017 Golden Globes speech revealed "liberals' worst assumptions about power" and accused her of supporting "equally repugnant politicians who happen to share her ideology" while claiming moral superiority.[^86] The essay criticized her for portraying wealthy Hollywood celebrities as an oppressed class and for focusing on Trump's personal behavior rather than systemic issues of militarism, inequality, and corporate power that transcend individual politicians.

Her handling of diversity issues has drawn sustained criticism. The Berlin Film Festival comments about "we're all Africans really" were widely mocked as tone-deaf and emblematic of white privilege. The Daily Beast's article "Meryl Streep's Divisive Feminism" argued that her brand of feminism centers white women's experiences while marginalizing women of color.[^87] Critics point out that while she advocates for gender equality, she has been less vocal about racial justice issues and has sometimes deflected from discussions of racial diversity.

The Weinstein controversy damaged her reputation among some observers who saw her response as deflection and prioritization of partisan politics over addressing sexual abuse in her own industry. Her claim that she "did not know about Weinstein's crimes" struck many as implausible given her prominence in the industry and Weinstein's long-rumored behavior.[^88]

Even her acting has not been immune to criticism. Some scholars and critics argue that her technical virtuosity—particularly accent work—can sometimes overwhelm characterization, creating performances that feel more like impressive impersonations than fully inhabited characters. The mixed reception to her Danish accent in *Out of Africa*, with Danish viewers finding it inaccurate, illustrates this critique.[^89] The Week published an article titled "Meryl Streep's anti-Trump speech is everything wrong with liberalism," arguing that celebrity activism like hers is counterproductive and exemplifies the very elitism that fuels populist backlash.[^90]

Her vacillation on identifying as a feminist—first rejecting the label in favor of "humanist," then embracing it—has been criticized as opportunistic and reflective of a generation of privileged white women who benefit from feminism while hesitating to fully commit to its principles.[^91]
