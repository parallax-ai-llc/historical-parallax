## Summary

Tun Musa bin Hitam is a Malaysian retired politician who served as Malaysia's fifth Deputy Prime Minister from 1981 to 1986 under Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad[^1]. Born into modest circumstances as the son of a meter reader, Musa rose through the ranks to become one of Malaysia's most prominent political figures, forming the influential "2M" leadership duo with Mahathir that guided Malaysia through a period of robust economic expansion[^2]. His resignation in 1986 over irreconcilable differences with Mahathir remains one of the most significant political events in Malaysian history[^3]. Following his political career, Musa continued to serve Malaysia in various capacities, including as chairman of SUHAKAM, the World Islamic Economic Forum Foundation, and Sime Darby[^4].

---

## Early Life and Background

Musa bin Hitam was born on 18 April 1934 in Johor Bahru, British Malaya, to a Malay father of Javanese descent and a mother of Chinese descent who was adopted by and grew up in a Malay household at age five[^5]. His father worked as a meter reader for the national electricity company, and the family lived in modest circumstances[^6]. Musa grew up as one of ten siblings—five brothers and four sisters—and was the only one among them to attend university, reflecting the rarity of tertiary education for those from modest backgrounds in pre-independent Malaya[^7].

At age seven, Musa experienced the Japanese invasion and occupation of Malaya in 1941, an event that marked his formative years amid wartime disruptions[^8]. These early experiences of hardship and occupation would later shape his political consciousness and commitment to Malaysian independence and development.

Musa continued his education at English College Johore Bahru, demonstrating academic excellence that would distinguish him throughout his career[^9]. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Malaya and his master's degree from the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom[^10]. His educational achievements were remarkable given his family's financial circumstances, and he would later be awarded various honours, including an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Sussex and an Honorary Doctorate from Ohio University in 1980[^11].

During his time as an international student, Musa met Datin Ines Maria Reyna, a Peruvian of Spanish descent, at Lima, Peru in 1959, whom he would later marry[^12]. This international exposure during his formative years contributed to his cosmopolitan outlook and diplomatic skills that would serve him well in his later political and international roles.

## Rise to Power

Musa Hitam's political career began in the 1960s when he briefly served as Acting Secretary-General of UMNO (United Malays National Organisation), Malaysia's dominant political party[^13]. However, his early political journey was not without controversy. He was expelled from the party in the wake of the 13 May 1969 racial rioting for insubordination to Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman[^14]. During his earlier years in UMNO politics, Datuk Musa Hitam was once regarded as an 'ultra', reflecting the nationalist fervor of that era[^15].

Musa was readmitted to UMNO in 1971 under the leadership of Tunku Abdul Rahman's successor, Abdul Razak Hussein, and rose quickly through the party ranks[^16]. His political rehabilitation and rapid ascent demonstrated both his political acumen and the recognition of his talents by the party leadership. He held several key positions in the Malaysian government, including Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry, Minister of Primary Industries (1974-1978), and Minister of Education (1978-1981)[^17].

As Minister of Primary Industries from 1974 to 1978, Musa Hitam oversaw the expansion of key commodity sectors, including rubber, tin, and palm oil, amid efforts to reduce over-reliance on rubber exports through diversification into higher-value crops like cocoa and enhanced palm oil production[^18]. He advocated for the establishment of specialized research facilities to bolster the rapidly growing palm oil industry, demonstrating his forward-thinking approach to economic development[^19].

Before becoming Deputy Prime Minister, Musa served as Chairman of the Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA), where he oversaw land development schemes aimed at resettling rural poor into productive agricultural communities, expanding smallholder palm oil and rubber cultivation to boost national agricultural output[^20]. FELDA resettled more than 112,000 settlers in colonies throughout Malaysia between 1958 and 1990, playing a crucial role in transforming rural Malaysia[^21].

In 1981, Musa Hitam faced Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah in a crucial party election for the position of UMNO Deputy President. Musa won decisively with 722 votes to Razaleigh's 517 votes, becoming the new Deputy President[^22]. On 16 July 1981, following Mahathir Mohamad's formal ascension to Prime Minister, Musa was appointed Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Home Affairs[^23].

## Major Achievements

### The "2M" Era (1981-1986)

As Deputy Prime Minister and Home Affairs Minister from 1981 to 1986, Musa Hitam formed the influential "2M" leadership duo with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad that guided Malaysia through a phase of robust economic expansion and policy reforms[^24]. The partnership between the two leaders was initially highly successful, and the 1982 general election victory was attributed to Mahathir and Musa Hitam's popularity, effective campaigning, and strategic candidate selection[^25].

In September 1981, Musa Hitam served as Acting Prime Minister when Mahathir Mohamad went on a two-week vacation with his family to Spain and Portugal, demonstrating the trust and responsibility placed in him[^26]. This marked the beginning of his role as Mahathir's right-hand man during a transformative period in Malaysian history.

### Education Reforms (1978-1981)

As Minister of Education from 1978 to 1981, Musa Hitam directed national education reforms that emphasized a structured and disciplined educational framework that prioritized national unity and rejected liberal, permissive models prevalent in some Western systems, aiming to foster balanced development aligned with Malaysia's multicultural context[^27].

One of his most significant achievements was the establishment of the Malaysian Examinations Council (MEC) on 1 February 1980 under the Malaysian Examinations Council Act (Act 225) as a statutory body operating under the Ministry of Education[^28]. The Council was officially launched on 22 April 1980 by Musa as Minister of Education[^29]. The examination system was first implemented in 1982 to replace the Higher School Certificate (HSC) and Sijil Tinggi Persekolahan (STP) examinations which were conducted by the University of Cambridge Local Examinations Syndicate (UCLES), representing a significant step toward localizing Malaysia's examination system[^30].

In 1978, the Education Ministry under Musa's leadership established the National Committee for Total Communication and standardized sign language in Malay language for hearing impaired students, demonstrating his commitment to inclusive education and accessibility for students with disabilities[^31].

### International Human Rights Leadership

After leaving active politics, Musa Hitam became a prominent advocate for human rights both domestically and internationally. He led the Malaysian delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights from 1993 to 1998 and was elected Chairman of the 52nd Session of the Commission in 1995, followed by second and third terms in 1996-98 and 2001-2003 respectively[^32]. This marked a significant achievement for Malaysia and Southeast Asia in international human rights discourse.

In 1994, Tun Musa suggested to the Malaysian Government to establish its own independent national human rights institution[^33]. This recommendation led to the creation of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia (SUHAKAM), which was established by Parliament under the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999 [Act 597], gazetted on September 9, 1999[^34]. Tan Sri Dato' Musa bin Hitam was appointed as SUHAKAM's first Chairman on April 3, 2000, together with 12 other members to serve a renewable two-year term[^35]. He served as Chairman from 1999 until 2002, when he was replaced by Tan Sri Abu Talib Othman[^36].

### World Islamic Economic Forum

Musa served as Chairman of the World Islamic Economic Forum (WIEF) Foundation, holding the post since the beginning of its incorporation in 2006 until his resignation in August 2021[^37]. Under his 15-year helm, the WIEF Foundation organized 13 annual Forums in major cities, such as London, Dubai, Astana, Jakarta, Islamabad, Kuwait and Kuala Lumpur[^38]. The Forum revealed the need for a unique body to promote dialogue and foster closer cooperation and partnership among the Muslim business community throughout the world[^39].

### Corporate Leadership

Between 1990 and 1991, Musa served as Malaysia's Special Envoy to the United Nations, and since 1995 he has been the Prime Minister's Special Envoy to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG)[^40]. In 2007, Musa became the chairman of Synergy Drive Berhad, the entity which arose out of the newly formed merger between Sime Darby, Guthrie, and Golden Hope Plantations[^41]. He was appointed to the Board of Synergy Drive Bhd on 29 September 2007 as Chairman and Non-Executive Director[^42]. Synergy Drive was later renamed Sime Darby Berhad on 27 November 2007, becoming Malaysia's largest conglomerate[^43]. Musa served as chairman until his retirement in November 2012, having intended to serve for three years from 2007 but extending his tenure due to various circumstances[^44].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Rift with Mahathir

The most significant controversy in Musa Hitam's career was his deteriorating relationship with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. While once close allies, both fell out with Musa claiming that Mahathir no longer trusted him[^45]. Musa resigned as deputy prime minister after Mahathir accused him of wanting to take over as prime minister[^46]. The relationship between the two leaders deteriorated significantly during their time working together, with Musa becoming very upset when Mahathir appointed Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah as industrial and trade minister[^47].

In 1986, after five years serving as Mahathir's deputy, Musa Hitam resigned as Deputy Prime Minister, citing irreconcilable differences with Mahathir[^48]. Former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad later declared his former right-hand man Musa Hitam as his "first failure," stating he could not wait for him to retire[^49]. Mahathir described Musa as someone who could not wait for Mahathir to retire, so he resigned after five years as deputy[^50].

### The 1987 UMNO Crisis

Following his resignation, Musa joined Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah's Team B as UMNO deputy president candidate during the 1987 UMNO internal elections[^51]. Mahathir was opposed by Razaleigh, with the press referring to Mahathir and his supporters as Team A, and Razaleigh's camp as Team B[^52]. Team B included Musa Hitam as the incumbent Deputy President of UMNO seeking re-election, as well as Suhaimi Kamaruddin[^53].

The election held on 24 April 1987 was extraordinarily close, with Team A prevailing narrowly. Mahathir received votes of 761 party delegates to Razaleigh's 718, a margin of just 43 votes[^54]. The Team B candidate for Deputy President, Musa Hitam, had also been defeated by Abdul Ghafar Baba of Team A[^55].

Allegations were made that several delegates who had voted were drawn from UMNO branches not properly registered[^56]. Legal challenges followed, and a judge ruled that UMNO was an unlawful society due to the existence of several unregistered branches[^57]. This constitutional crisis was a pivotal moment in Malaysian political history. Tengku Razaleigh went on to form Semangat 46, but Musa never returned to active politics[^58].

### The Memali Incident

One of the most controversial episodes associated with Musa's tenure as Home Affairs Minister was the Memali Incident, which occurred on November 19, 1985, in Kampung Memali, Baling, Kedah[^59]. A team of 200 policemen, under orders from Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam, laid siege to village houses, resulting in the deaths of 14 villagers and 4 policemen[^60].

Deputy Prime Minister Musa Hitam, who was also Home Affairs Minister, announced to the media that 14 'criminals' had been killed in Kampung Memali in clashes with security forces[^61]. However, controversy erupted over who was actually in charge at the time of the incident. Media initially reported that Dr. Mahathir Mohamad was away on a visit to China, identifying Musa as the Acting Prime Minister[^62]. That story remained unchanged until 2014, nearly 29 years later, when Musa revealed that Dr. Mahathir was in fact still in his office in Malaysia, and Musa categorically denied he was the Acting Prime Minister at that time[^63].

In 2014, Dr Mahathir confirmed that he was present in Malaysia on the day of the incident, but he denied claims by Musa that he had asked Dr Mahathir to postpone his visit to China scheduled the day after the incident[^64]. The incident remains controversial, with ongoing debates about responsibility and whether excessive force was used during the police operation. Opposition leader Lim Kit Siang has called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the 29-year Memali incident, especially as the protagonists like Mahathir and Musa Hitam are still alive and can testify on the tragedy which cost the lives of 18 people (including four policemen)[^65].

### Corporate Controversies

Questions were raised about Musa Hitam's credentials based on his role during massive financial losses at Sime Darby during his chairmanship there[^66]. The losses and controversies at one of Malaysia's largest conglomerates raised questions about corporate governance and oversight during his tenure, though he retired from the position in 2012.

### Later Political Criticisms

In later years, Musa Hitam became increasingly critical of contemporary Malaysian politics. He stated that Malaysian politics is no longer about philosophy or ideologies and instead has become a "joke" with a large number of political defectors[^67]. In his 2016 memoir "Frankly Speaking," he expressed alarm at the "very disturbing" levels of hatred permeating Malaysian politics, attributing it to personal animosities rather than ideological differences[^68].

## Personal Life

### Family Background and Marriages

Musa bin Hitam came from a multiracial family background. His father was Malay of Javanese descent, while his mother was of Chinese descent who was adopted by and grew up in a Malay household at age five[^69]. This mixed heritage gave Musa a unique perspective on Malaysia's multiracial society.

Musa was married to Datin Ines Maria Reyna, a Peruvian of Spanish descent, whom he first met at Lima, Peru in 1959 as an international student[^70]. From this first marriage to Ines Maria Reyna, they had three children: Mariana, Carlos Abdul Rashid, and Rosana[^71].

Tragically, his son Carlos was killed together with his wife Rozina Datuk Abu Bakar, a news anchor on TV3, during the Highland Towers collapse on 11 December 1993[^72]. The Highland Towers collapse was one of Malaysia's worst building disasters, and the loss of his son and daughter-in-law in this tragedy was a profound personal blow to Musa and his family.

Musa is now married to Toh Puan Zulaikha Sheardin[^73]. From his current marriage to Zulaikha Sheardin, Tun Musa has one son, Hanif[^74]. Additionally, Tun Musa has three grandchildren: Marisa, Lara and Kaelen[^75]. Sadly, his daughter Mariana Musa died in November 2022, with the King and Queen extending condolences to Musa Hitam and family on his daughter's death[^76].

### Character and Personality

Throughout his career, Musa Hitam has been known for his principled stance on political issues. He has consistently opposed the exploitation of race and religion for political gain, describing such tactics as hallmarks of "bankrupt politicians" seeking short-term support rather than national unity[^77]. He famously stated: "Only bankrupt politicians use race and religion to gain political mileage"[^78].

On the balance between freedom and moderation, Musa articulated his philosophy: "Freedom without limits makes you an extremist. Freedom with limits make you a moderate. But in order to limit it does not mean abolish or ban them – then you become an extremist"[^79]. This statement reflects his moderate political philosophy and rejection of extremism in all forms.

Musa has admitted to being naive during his time as Deputy Prime Minister, reflecting in later years on the complexities of high-level political leadership and the challenges he faced[^80]. Despite the controversies and political setbacks he experienced, Musa has maintained his dignity and continued to contribute to Malaysian society through various roles.

## Legacy

### A Principled Leader

Musa Hitam's legacy is primarily defined by his principled resignation from the position of Deputy Prime Minister in 1986. He relinquished his position because he fundamentally disagreed with policy directions his principles would not allow him to accept[^81]. Musa was described as being "a hair's breadth away from becoming the fifth prime minister of Malaysia" before he walked away from his position[^82].

Sultan Nazrin Shah, in his speech at the launch of Musa Hitam's autobiography "Frankly Speaking" in August 2016, described Musa as "a product of 'the Malaysian dream'" who "has stood like a rock, and paid the price for it when he resigned as deputy prime minister for what he believed in"[^83]. The Sultan stated that "Tun Musa has stood by his principles and he has done so with dignity"[^84].

Sultan Nazrin noted that Musa was "a product of 'the Malaysian dream', where the citizens of this fledgling country harboured great expectations and aspired to great things"[^85]. From the humble beginnings of being the son of a meter reader, Musa rose to become deputy prime minister and a Harvard fellow[^86]. The Sultan observed that "of the hundreds of thousands who have realised their own Malaysian dream, Musa Hitam stands out among the handful who have left an ineradicable mark on the country he loves with a passion"[^87].

### Cross-Party Recognition

Perhaps most remarkably, Musa Hitam earned praise from across the political spectrum. DAP veteran Lim Kit Siang, a longtime opposition leader, called Musa Hitam "the best prime minister that Malaysia never had" during a question-and-answer session at the launch of Lim Kit Siang's biography in January 2022[^88]. When asked by a member of the audience, Lim responded "There is no doubt about that," excitedly gesturing to Musa, who was present as a guest at the launch event[^89].

Fellow panellist Syed Saddiq Syed Abdul Rahman noted that Lim and Musa's relationship symbolized the kind of political environment Malaysia should strive towards, saying their shared vision to build Malaysia as a developed and dignified country was similar[^90]. This praise is particularly notable given that Lim Kit Siang was a longtime opposition leader, while Musa Hitam was a senior UMNO politician, demonstrating Musa's ability to transcend partisan divisions.

### Contributions to Human Rights

After retiring from active politics, Musa Hitam maintained a public presence through interviews, speeches, and writings, often critiquing the state of Malaysian political discourse and advocating for principled governance over factionalism[^91]. His role in establishing SUHAKAM and his leadership of Malaysia's delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights represent significant contributions to the advancement of human rights in Malaysia and the region.

His suggestion in 1994 to establish Malaysia's own independent national human rights institution led to the creation of SUHAKAM, which continues to play an important role in promoting and protecting human rights in Malaysia[^92]. As the first Chairman of SUHAKAM from 2000 to 2002, Musa helped establish the institutional framework and credibility of the commission during its formative years[^93].

### International Recognition

Musa Hitam's international contributions have been recognized through various honors. He received the Imperial decoration "Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun" from Japan in recognition of his contribution to promoting economic relations between Japan and Malaysia[^94]. The 'Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun' is one of the highest distinctions receivable by foreigners from the Japanese government, and has only been received by 12 Malaysians thus far[^95]. The ceremony was held at the Japanese Ambassador's Residence in June 2019[^96].

On 25 September 2024, Tun Musa Hitam was appointed as the Grand Chancellor of the Order of Loyalty to the Crown of Malaysia by Yang di-Pertuan Agong for a three-year tenure, until 12 September 2027[^97]. This recent appointment demonstrates continued recognition of his service to Malaysia even in his 90s.

### Impact on Malaysian Politics

Musa Hitam's resignation and the subsequent 1987 UMNO crisis had lasting impacts on Malaysian politics. The split forced the Malaysian court to declare UMNO as illegal, leading to the formation of UMNO Baru (New UMNO) and reshaping the political landscape[^98]. While Tengku Razaleigh went on to form Semangat 46, Musa's decision not to return to active politics reflected his commitment to principle over political ambition[^99].

His critical observations about contemporary Malaysian politics, stating that it is no longer about philosophy or ideologies but has become a "joke" with numerous political defectors, reflect his disappointment with the evolution of political discourse in Malaysia[^100]. Yet his willingness to speak out on these issues demonstrates his continued engagement with and concern for Malaysia's political future.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Musa Hitam is widely regarded as a moderate, principled leader who prioritized national interest over personal political ambition. Scholars and political observers have praised his willingness to resign from the second-highest office in the land rather than compromise his principles[^101]. His educational background, including degrees from the University of Malaya and University of Sussex, combined with his practical political experience, made him one of Malaysia's most intellectually equipped leaders[^102].

His contributions to education reform, particularly the establishment of the Malaysian Examinations Council, represented significant steps toward educational independence and the localization of Malaysia's examination system[^103]. His work in rural development through FELDA helped transform the lives of over 112,000 settlers and their families, contributing to poverty alleviation and agricultural development[^104].

Supporters point to his international human rights work as evidence of his commitment to universal values and his ability to represent Malaysia credibly on the world stage[^105]. His election as Chairman of the UN Commission on Human Rights for multiple terms demonstrated international respect for his leadership and diplomatic skills[^106]. His role in establishing SUHAKAM showed foresight in recognizing the importance of institutional mechanisms for protecting human rights[^107].

His advocacy for moderation and rejection of racial and religious politics has been praised by those who see him as representing a more principled and inclusive approach to Malaysian politics[^108]. His famous statement that "only bankrupt politicians use race and religion to gain political mileage" resonates with those who seek a more mature political discourse in Malaysia[^109].

The cross-party praise he has received, particularly from opposition leader Lim Kit Siang who called him "the best prime minister that Malaysia never had," suggests that his legacy transcends partisan politics[^110]. This bipartisan recognition is rare in Malaysian politics and speaks to the respect he commanded across the political spectrum.

### Negative Views

Critics point to the Memali Incident as a dark stain on Musa Hitam's record, with 18 people (including four policemen) killed during a police operation under his authority as Home Affairs Minister[^111]. The controversy over who was actually in charge at the time—with conflicting accounts from Musa and Mahathir—has raised questions about accountability and transparency[^112]. Calls for a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the incident reflect ongoing concerns about the use of force and the circumstances surrounding the tragedy[^113].

Some observers argue that Musa's resignation, while principled, represented a failure of political leadership and an inability to work through differences with Prime Minister Mahathir[^114]. Dr. Mahathir's characterization of Musa as his "first failure" who "could not wait for him to retire" suggests that personal ambition may have played a role in the breakdown of their relationship[^115].

The 1987 UMNO crisis that followed Musa's resignation, in which he joined Team B against Mahathir, has been criticized as contributing to political instability and party division at a crucial time in Malaysia's development[^116]. While the crisis ultimately led to party reforms, it also caused significant disruption and uncertainty in Malaysian politics.

Questions raised about massive financial losses at Sime Darby during his chairmanship have cast doubt on his corporate governance skills and business acumen[^117]. Critics suggest that his appointment to such positions was based more on political connections than business expertise, and that the losses during his tenure reflected inadequate oversight and management.

Some critics view his later criticisms of Malaysian politics as the complaints of someone who failed to achieve the highest office and is bitter about being sidelined[^118]. They argue that his characterization of contemporary politics as a "joke" shows a lack of appreciation for the democratic evolution and increased political competition in Malaysia.

His early expulsion from UMNO in 1969 for "insubordination" and his characterization as an "ultra" in his early political years suggest a more complex political trajectory than his later moderate image suggests[^119]. Critics question whether his principled stance in 1986 was truly about policy differences or reflected personal and political calculations about his inability to succeed Mahathir.
