## Summary

On November 17, 2018, over 300,000 French citizens donned bright yellow safety vests—the _gilets jaunes_ required by law in every French car—and blocked roads, roundabouts, and tolls across France. What began as a protest against fuel tax increases became the most significant popular uprising France had seen since 1968. For months, the Yellow Vests occupied the streets, clashed with riot police, and forced President Emmanuel Macron to retreat on his signature economic reforms.[^1]

The Yellow Vests were unlike any previous French movement. They had no leaders, no political party, no union backing. They organized through Facebook, and they came from places French elites rarely thought about: rural areas, small towns, the outskirts where people drove to work because there was no public transit. Their anger was at fuel taxes, yes, but more fundamentally at a president they saw as "president of the rich"—a former investment banker who had abolished the wealth tax while raising taxes on diesel.[^2]

Macron eventually backed down. The fuel tax was scrapped. Minimum wage was raised. Some €10 billion in concessions were announced. But the wounds remained: 11 people died during the protests, thousands were injured (including devastating eye injuries from police rubber bullets), and French society's fractures—between Paris and the periphery, between the "winners" and "losers" of globalization—were laid bare for all to see.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Macron's France

**Emmanuel Macron:**

- Elected 2017 (age 39)
- Former economy minister, investment banker
- Centrist/liberal reform agenda
- Pro-EU, pro-market

**His reforms:**

- Abolished wealth tax (ISF)
- Reformed labor code (more flexibility)
- Planned pension reform
- Carbon tax increases

**The perception:**

- "President of the rich"
- Out of touch with ordinary people
- Arrogant style

**By late 2018:** Approval ratings collapsing.[^4]

### The Fuel Tax

**The issue:**

- Fuel (especially diesel) heavily taxed in France
- Diesel: Preferred fuel for decades
- 2018: Diesel prices rose 16%
- Government announced further tax increases for 2019
- Framed as climate policy ("carbon tax")

**Who it hit:**

- Rural residents (no public transit)
- Commuters in suburbs
- Working class
- Small business owners

**"We can't make ends meet already."**[^5]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Immediate:**

- Fuel tax as last straw
- Cost of living squeeze

**Structural:**

- Decades of deindustrialization
- Urban-rural divide
- Globalization's losers
- Political class seen as disconnected

**French specifics:**

- Revolutionary tradition
- Distrust of government
- Centralized state = clear target

### Why Was It Significant?

**A new kind of movement:**

- No leaders, no party, no union
- Social media organized
- Symbolically powerful
- United disparate grievances

**Forced government retreat:**

- First time Macron backed down
- "En Marche" not invincible

### Comparison

| Movement              | Trigger          | Deaths | Outcome                        |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------------ |
| May 1968              | Students/workers | 7      | De Gaulle shaken               |
| **Yellow Vests 2018** | **Fuel tax**     | **11** | **Tax cancelled; concessions** |
| Pension protests 2019 | Reform           | 0      | Reform paused (COVID)          |

**The Yellow Vests were the biggest since '68—and they partially won.**[^11]

## Legacy
