## Summary

Pedro Paulet was a Peruvian scientist who designed and tested a liquid-fueled rocket engine in 1897, potentially before any other experimenter. He designed a spacecraft concept using liquid propulsion decades before modern rocketry. Though his work was not widely recognized internationally, Wernher von Braun acknowledged him as a pioneer of the space age.
