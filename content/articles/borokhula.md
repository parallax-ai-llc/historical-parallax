## Summary

Borokhula (also spelled Boroqul, Boroghul, or Boro'ul; c. 1162–1217) was one of the foremost generals of Genghis Khan and a foundling raised by the Khan's mother, Hoelun.[^1] He earned legendary status by saving the life of Ögedei Khan, Genghis Khan's son and heir, after the Battle of Khalakhaljid Sands in 1203 by continuously sucking clotted blood from an arrow wound in his neck.[^2] As one of the "Four Steeds" of Genghis Khan, Borokhula held command of the elite keshig (imperial guard) and served on the Khan's inner council until his death in 1217 during a campaign against the Tumed tribes.[^3] His loyalty, military prowess, and ultimate sacrifice made him one of the most honored commanders in early Mongol Empire history, with his descendants continuing to hold positions of power for generations.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Borokhula was born around 1162, originating from the Üüshin lineage of the Jurkin tribe, a clan related by blood to Genghis Khan's own Borjigin clan.[^5] The Jurkin was one of three major clans within the Kiyan tribe and held higher genealogical status than the Borjigin in traditional Mongol hierarchy.[^6] However, Borokhula's early life took a dramatic turn when he became orphaned at a young age. According to the Secret History of the Mongols, the primary chronicle of 13th-century Mongol history, Borokhula was given to Temüjin's family as a foundling around 1170 or 1183, though sources differ on the exact date.[^7][^8]

Hoelun, Temüjin's mother, raised Borokhula alongside her biological children, creating a quasi-familial bond that would prove crucial to the formation of the Mongol Empire.[^9] This practice of adopting foundlings was not uncommon in Hoelun's household—she raised numerous orphaned children who later became commanders in the Mongolian armed forces, with one even becoming chief justice.[^10] After Genghis Khan unified the Mongols, Hoelun's official role institutionalized this practice as she cared for children orphaned in battle.[^11]

Growing up in Temüjin's household during the turbulent late 12th century, Borokhula experienced firsthand the harsh realities of steppe nomadic life. The Mongol tribes of this era lived in temporary camps of circular felt tents called yurts or gers, moving seasonally to sustain their herds of sheep, goats, horses, camels, and yaks.[^12] The steppe was divided among numerous clans and tribes, each with its own leader, and alliances were notoriously short-lived as clans frequently switched allegiances.[^13] This instability shaped Borokhula's early years and forged the intense personal loyalty that would characterize his relationship with Genghis Khan.

Despite the eventual extermination of the Jurkin nobility by Temüjin due to their betrayal—they had plundered his property during his absence on a raid—Borokhula's Üüshin lineage survived through his adoption into Genghis Khan's family.[^14] This early experience of losing his original tribal identity and being incorporated into a new family structure may have predisposed Borokhula to embrace the meritocratic principles that Genghis Khan would later implement across the empire, where loyalty and ability mattered more than birth.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Borokhula's rise to prominence within Genghis Khan's inner circle was gradual but inexorable, built on consistent loyalty during Temüjin's most difficult years. The late 12th and early 13th centuries saw Temüjin struggle against numerous rivals for supremacy on the Mongolian steppe, and Borokhula stood by him through defeats and victories alike.

One of the earliest recorded instances of Borokhula's military service came during the 1199 campaign against the Naiman tribes, when the "Four Steeds"—Bo'orchu, Borokhula, Muqali, and Chilaun—were first mentioned as a group.[^16] They led a detachment that helped the Kereyits, led by Toghrul (Wang Khan), Temüjin's ally and blood brother of Temüjin's father, fend off a Naiman attack.[^17] This early campaign demonstrated Borokhula's tactical capabilities and his ability to work within Genghis Khan's emerging command structure.

The turning point in Borokhula's career—and indeed in Mongol history—came in 1203 during one of Temüjin's darkest hours. Toghrul, who had been Temüjin's patron and ally for years, betrayed him after refusing to give his daughter in marriage to Jochi, Temüjin's eldest son—a profound sign of disrespect in Mongolian culture.[^18] Toghrul's son, Ilga Senggüm, attempted to assassinate Temüjin and then launched a surprise attack with Kerait forces.[^19] At the Battle of Khalakhaljid Sands (also called Qalaqaljid Sands), Temüjin suffered a decisive defeat and was forced to retreat.[^20]

During this catastrophic battle, Temüjin's seventeen-year-old son Ögedei was struck by an arrow in the neck and became separated from the main Mongol force.[^21] Initially presumed lost in the rout, Ögedei was found by Borokhula, who performed an act of extraordinary courage and devotion that would define his legacy. Throughout the night ride back to Temüjin's camp, Borokhula continuously sucked clotted blood from Ögedei's neck wound to keep the airway clear and prevent him from choking to death.[^22] When they finally arrived at camp, witnesses reported that "blood [was] trickling from the corners of [Borokhula's] mouth."[^23] This selfless act saved the life of the man who would eventually succeed Genghis Khan as the second Great Khan of the Mongol Empire.

Following this defeat, Temüjin retreated to Baljuna, an unidentified river or lake in southeastern Mongolia, where his forces had dwindled to perhaps only 2,600 to 4,600 warriors.[^24] At Baljuna in mid-1203, Temüjin and his closest companions, including Borokhula, swore the Baljuna Covenant—an oath of mutual fidelity promising to share hardships and glories.[^25] This covenant was remarkable for its religious and ethnic diversity, as it included Muslims, Christians, Buddhists, and Tengrist adherents, transcending traditional tribal boundaries to create what historian Jack Weatherford described as "a type of brotherhood [akin to] modern civic citizenship based upon personal choice and commitment."[^26] Borokhula's participation in this oath cemented his position among Temüjin's most trusted followers.

The aftermath of the Baljuna Covenant saw a dramatic reversal of fortune. Within months, Temüjin rallied his forces and defeated the Kerait, whose coalition had collapsed.[^27] Toghrul attempted to escape to the Naimans but was killed by a Naiman warrior who failed to recognize him.[^28] By 1204, at the Battle of Chakirmaut, Temüjin had defeated the Naimans as well, securing his dominance over the Mongolian steppe.[^29]

## Major Achievements

Borokhula's greatest achievements came during and after 1206, the year Temüjin was proclaimed Genghis Khan at a historic kurultai (assembly) that brought together nearly all the "People of the Felt Walls"—approximately one million Mongols—in encampments spreading for miles.[^30] At this unprecedented gathering, the shaman Teb Tenggeri proclaimed Temüjin "khan of the Great Mongol Nation" (Yeke Mongghol Ulus), and he assumed the title Genghis Khan, meaning "Universal Ruler."[^31]

At the May 1206 kurultai, Genghis Khan rewarded his most loyal companions, with special honors reserved for those who had accompanied him since the beginning and those who had sworn the Baljuna Covenant.[^32] Borokhula received a selection of rewards and exemptions bettered only by those given to Bo'orchu and Muqali—the two most senior of Genghis Khan's commanders.[^33] These rewards included exemptions from the death penalty and prestigious positions such as cupbearer and high steward.[^34] More significantly, Borokhula was named one of the "Four Steeds" (dörben morin) alongside Bo'orchu, Muqali, and Chilaun, the four men who would share titular command of the keshig, the Mongol imperial guard.[^35]

The keshig represented the pinnacle of military and political power in the emerging Mongol Empire. Genghis Khan had established it around 1203 following his defeat of Wang Khan, initially consisting of seventy day guards (torguud) and eighty night guards (khevtuul).[^36] By the 1206 kurultai, the keshig was massively expanded from 1,150 to 10,000 men, forming an elite force divided into day guards (Torguud) and night guards (Khebtuul).[^37] Membership in the keshig was regarded as the supreme honor in the empire, and ordinary soldiers in the imperial guard held precedence over commanders in the rest of the army.[^38] The keshig functioned not only as the imperial bodyguard but also as a training ground for future officers—many of history's greatest Mongol generals, including Subutai, Chormaqan, and Baiju, started their careers in the keshig before receiving independent commands.[^39]

Together with the "Four Hounds" (also called the "Four Dogs of War")—Subutai, Jebe, Jelme, and Khubilai Noyan—the Four Steeds formed Genghis Khan's "paladins," or inner council.[^40] The distinction between these two groups was significant: while the Four Hounds were aggressive field commanders whom Genghis Khan described as having "foreheads of brass, jaws like scissors, tongues like piercing awls, heads of iron, and whipping tails like swords" who "devour enemy flesh" in battle, the Four Steeds represented trusted advisors who combined military prowess with administrative wisdom.[^41][^42]

The Persian historian Rashid al-Din Hamadani, writing in his comprehensive 14th-century work Jami' al-tawarikh (Compendium of Chronicles)—considered "the first world history" and "the single most comprehensive Persian source on the Mongol period"—recorded that Borokhula and Bo'orchu were held in such extraordinary respect that Genghis Khan would never issue them specific military orders, unlike other generals such as Muqali, Jebe, and Subutai.[^43][^44] This unprecedented trust reflected both their early loyalty and their proven judgment in military and political matters.

Borokhula's role extended beyond military command to include diplomatic and administrative functions. As high steward, he helped implement Genghis Khan's revolutionary military reforms, which promoted commanders based on merit rather than clan seniority—a radical departure from traditional steppe practice.[^45] Genghis Khan allocated ninety-five minqad (units of a thousand) to his favored followers, with units assigned to loyal companions like Borokhula being more numerous compared to those given to his own family members.[^46] This meritocratic system, which Borokhula helped administer, became a cornerstone of Mongol military success.

The Mongol military framework that Borokhula helped implement was structured on a decimal system: units of 10 (Arban), 100 (Zuun), 1,000 (Mingghan), and 10,000 (Tumen).[^47] Mongol forces employed sophisticated tactics including the feigned retreat, where small forces would lure enemies back to larger Mongol formations, and the tulughma (envelopment), attacking with central cavalry while wings encircled the enemy.[^48] Mongol armies could traverse over 100 miles daily, with each soldier maintaining three or four horses to enable rapid movement without exhausting the animals.[^49] Borokhula's command of the keshig placed him at the heart of this military machine, training the next generation of commanders in these revolutionary tactics.

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Borokhula himself is rarely criticized in historical sources—his loyalty and sacrifice earning him nearly universal admiration—his service to Genghis Khan inevitably associated him with the controversial aspects of Mongol conquest and governance. The Mongol military campaigns in which Borokhula participated employed terror as a deliberate strategic weapon: when cities were captured, entire civilian populations could be executed, with a handful of survivors allowed to escape to spread news of the atrocity to neighboring towns.[^50] This psychological warfare, while militarily effective, has made the Mongol conquests synonymous with unprecedented brutality in popular historical consciousness.

The expansion of the keshig under Borokhula's co-command also reflected a concentration of power that could be seen as undermining traditional Mongol tribal democracy. The principle that ordinary keshig soldiers held precedence over regular army commanders created a privileged military caste that disrupted the previous clan-based hierarchy.[^51] While this meritocratic approach was revolutionary in promoting talent over birth, it also created resentment among traditional tribal leaders whose authority was diminished.

Borokhula's final campaign in 1217 raises questions about military judgment and the Mongol approach to indigenous forest peoples. The campaign against the Tumed tribes and other Forest Peoples of Siberia was provoked when the Khori-Tumed, perhaps angered by the presence of Jochi's armies moving westward, revolted against Mongol authority.[^52] The Mongol response was characteristically brutal: after Borokhula's death, Jochi and Dorbei Doqshin subjugated the Tumed during a grueling winter campaign in 1217-18, with 100 Tumeds being sacrificed in vengeance for Borokhula's spirit.[^53] This act of mass human sacrifice, while consistent with Mongol funerary practices for high-ranking nobles, exemplifies the ruthlessness that characterized Mongol imperial expansion.

Most intriguingly, Borokhula set out on his final campaign "despite having a strong premonition of his impending death if he went."[^54] This raises questions about why he proceeded with the mission. Did he feel compelled to obey despite his fears? Did Genghis Khan pressure him, or did Borokhula's sense of duty override his self-preservation? Medieval sources offer no clear answer, but the incident reveals the immense pressure on Genghis Khan's inner circle to demonstrate unwavering courage and loyalty. Mongol culture took omens and premonitions seriously—shooting stars were considered omens of death, representing a person's energy line dying out—so Borokhula's decision to proceed despite his foreboding suggests either extraordinary devotion or social coercion.[^55][^56]

The fate of Borokhula's original tribe, the Jurkin, also casts a shadow over his story. Genghis Khan exterminated the Jurkin nobility after they plundered his property during his absence, taking the common people as his own soldiers and servants.[^57] While Borokhula himself was not involved in this decision—he had already been adopted into Genghis Khan's household—his elevation coincided with the destruction of his birth clan. Some historians have questioned whether adopted foundlings like Borokhula were fully free agents or whether their dependence on their adoptive families created a form of obligation that limited their autonomy. The fact that Borokhula's Üüshin lineage later became "a powerful aristocratic family in the Mongol Empire" suggests that accommodation with the conqueror brought material benefits, raising questions about collaboration and survival strategies among conquered peoples.[^58]

## Personal Life

Details about Borokhula's personal and family life are fragmentary in the historical record, as medieval chronicles focused primarily on military achievements and political roles rather than intimate personal details. What is known comes primarily from the Secret History of the Mongols and Persian sources like Rashid al-Din's Jami' al-tawarikh.

Borokhula's most defining personal relationship was with his adoptive mother, Hoelun, who raised him as one of her own children.[^59] This created a sibling-like bond with Genghis Khan himself, though the hierarchical nature of Mongol society meant that Borokhula always occupied a subordinate position as an adopted foundling rather than a biological member of the ruling family. The intensity of this quasi-familial relationship is evident in Genghis Khan's actions after Borokhula's death: the Khan took personal responsibility for the welfare of Borokhula's children, awarding them honors and taking an active interest in their careers.[^60]

Borokhula had multiple children, though their exact number and names are not fully preserved in surviving sources. What is clear is that his descendants continued to receive the titular command of the keshig (imperial guard), maintaining the prestigious position their father had held.[^61] This hereditary transmission of military office represented a departure from pure meritocracy and suggests that Genghis Khan created a new aristocracy based on the loyal companions of his early struggles, effectively replacing the old tribal nobility with a new elite forged through personal loyalty.

The respect accorded to Borokhula by his peers was extraordinary. The exemption from receiving specific military orders—a privilege he shared only with Bo'orchu—indicates that Genghis Khan trusted their independent judgment completely.[^62] This level of autonomy was unprecedented in the Mongol military, where discipline and chain of command were typically absolute. The fact that this exemption was explicitly recorded by Rashid al-Din suggests it was considered remarkable even in an empire known for rewarding merit and loyalty.

Borokhula's personality can be partially inferred from his actions. The decision to risk his own health by sucking blood from Ögedei's wound for an entire night demonstrates not only physical courage but also deep personal devotion.[^63] Medieval Mongol medicine was sophisticated in its way, but directly exposing oneself to another person's blood carried obvious health risks, particularly from an arrow wound that could easily become infected. Borokhula's willingness to do this for hours during a desperate retreat speaks to a character defined by selfless loyalty.

His response to his premonition of death in 1217 reveals another aspect of his character. Mongol culture was deeply superstitious, with strong beliefs in omens and supernatural signs, and premonitions of death were taken seriously.[^64] The fact that Borokhula proceeded with the campaign despite this foreboding suggests either fatalistic acceptance of his destiny or a sense of duty so profound that it overrode his fear of death. The sources do not record whether he shared his premonition with Genghis Khan or kept it private, but the fact that it was remembered and recorded suggests it was known to others, possibly making his decision even more poignant to his contemporaries.

## Legacy

Borokhula's death in 1217 sent shockwaves through the Mongol leadership. Incensed at the news of his companion's death, Genghis Khan made preparations to personally lead a punitive campaign against the Tumed tribes—an extraordinary response that speaks to Borokhula's importance and the Khan's personal grief.[^65] Only the intervention of Muqali and Bo'orchu, his two remaining senior advisors, dissuaded Genghis Khan from this course.[^66] Instead, the Khan sent his eldest son Jochi, accompanied by the general Dorbei Doqshin, who together managed to subjugate the Tumed during a grueling winter campaign in 1217–18.[^67] The vengeful execution of 100 Tumeds as sacrifices for Borokhula's spirit underscored how highly the Mongol elite valued him.[^68]

The immediate institutional impact of Borokhula's death was significant. With Borokhula gone, the "Four Steeds" were reduced to three, though the organizational structure they had created continued. Command of the keshig passed to Borokhula's descendants, establishing a hereditary military aristocracy that would endure for generations.[^69] The Üüshin clan, to which Borokhula belonged, became one of the powerful aristocratic families in the Mongol Empire, its status permanently elevated by Borokhula's achievements.[^70]

Borokhula's military legacy was profound. As one of the architects of the keshig system, he helped create the institutional framework that trained many of history's greatest military commanders. Generals like Subutai—often considered one of the greatest military strategists of all time—and Chormaqan began their careers in the keshig before receiving independent commands.[^71] The decimal military organization, the emphasis on meritocratic promotion, and the combination of elite guard duty with leadership training all bore Borokhula's influence as co-commander of the imperial guard.

The story of Borokhula saving Ögedei's life gained legendary status and exemplified the ideal of loyalty that Genghis Khan sought to cultivate. Ögedei would go on to rule as the second Great Khan from 1229 to 1241, overseeing the continued expansion of the Mongol Empire into Europe, the Middle East, and China.[^72] Without Borokhula's intervention in 1203, this succession might never have occurred, potentially altering the course of world history. The succession struggles that plagued later Mongol history might have begun much earlier, and the empire's expansion might have taken a dramatically different trajectory.

In the broader context of Mongol military leadership, Borokhula represents a transitional figure between the old tribal system and the new imperial meritocracy. Born into the Jurkin tribe—a clan that was subsequently destroyed by Genghis Khan—Borokhula transcended his origins through adoption and personal loyalty. His elevation demonstrated that in the new Mongol order, chosen family could be more important than blood relations, and proven loyalty more valuable than noble birth. This principle, which Borokhula embodied, became foundational to the Mongol Empire's ability to incorporate diverse peoples and talents.

Modern historical assessments of Mongol commanders emphasize their innovative leadership practices, particularly the meritocratic promotion system that allowed talented individuals from humble origins to rise to the highest ranks.[^73] Borokhula's career exemplifies this principle: an orphaned foundling who became one of the four most powerful military commanders in the empire. This meritocracy, combined with the autonomy and trust Genghis Khan extended to his top generals, enabled the Mongols to conquer "vast swathes of Asia in the 13th and 14th century CE" and create "the contemporarily largest polity in human history."[^74][^75]

In contemporary Mongolia, the legacy of Genghis Khan's early companions remains powerful, though Borokhula has received less attention than some other generals. Bo'orchu, his peer among the Four Steeds, is commemorated with a statue in front of the Government Palace in Sükhbaatar Square, Ulaanbaatar.[^76] While Borokhula lacks such prominent modern memorialization, his story remains an essential part of Mongolian historical consciousness, taught as an example of loyalty, courage, and self-sacrifice.

The historiographical treatment of Borokhula demonstrates the challenges of reconstructing 13th-century Mongol history. The primary source, the Secret History of the Mongols, provides vivid narrative but contains chronological inconsistencies and was written from a specifically Mongolian perspective.[^77] Persian sources like Rashid al-Din's Jami' al-tawarikh offer valuable corroboration and alternative perspectives but were written a century later and reflect the viewpoints of the sedentary civilizations the Mongols conquered.[^78] The convergence of these sources on key facts about Borokhula—his foundling status, his saving of Ögedei, his position among the Four Steeds, and his death in 1217—suggests these core elements are historically reliable, even if specific details remain uncertain.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship on the Mongol Empire increasingly emphasizes the positive contributions of Genghis Khan's early companions to the development of sophisticated imperial institutions. Military historians particularly praise the organizational innovations embodied by commanders like Borokhula. The keshig system that Borokhula helped create and command has been analyzed as an early example of combining elite military training with administrative preparation, creating a cadre of leaders capable of both military command and civil governance.[^79]

Jack Weatherford, whose scholarship on the Mongol Empire has emphasized its progressive aspects, might view Borokhula's participation in the Baljuna Covenant as emblematic of the Mongols' transcendence of traditional tribal and religious boundaries.[^80] The oath sworn at Baljuna brought together people of different faiths and ethnicities in a bond of personal loyalty and mutual commitment, prefiguring the religious tolerance and multi-ethnic administration that would characterize the Mongol Empire at its height. Borokhula, as a foundling from a destroyed tribe who became one of the empire's most powerful figures, personified this meritocratic ideal.

Scholars studying military leadership and organizational behavior have found much to admire in the Mongol command structure that Borokhula helped implement. The principle that Genghis Khan would not issue specific orders to his most trusted commanders, granting them strategic autonomy while maintaining overall coordination, represents sophisticated mission-command principles that anticipated modern military doctrine.[^81] The fact that this trust was extended to Borokhula, a former foundling, rather than reserved for biological relatives, demonstrates a remarkable institutional maturity.

The story of Borokhula saving Ögedei's life has been celebrated as exemplifying the highest ideals of personal loyalty and self-sacrifice. Sucking blood from a potentially fatal wound throughout a night-long retreat required not only physical courage but also emotional devotion and medical knowledge. This act ensured the succession of a ruler who, while certainly responsible for continued Mongol conquests, also implemented administrative reforms and supported cultural and religious diversity within the empire.[^82]

Mongolian national historiography naturally views Borokhula positively as one of the heroes who created the nation's greatest historical achievement. The emphasis on his humble origins and rise through merit aligns with modern values while celebrating traditional Mongolian virtues of loyalty, courage, and horsemanship. His role in the keshig connects him to the military traditions that remain central to Mongolian national identity.

### Negative Views

Critical historical assessments of Borokhula must contend with his integral role in building an empire responsible for massive death and destruction. While Borokhula himself died relatively early in the Mongol expansion—in 1217, before the conquest of the Khwarazmian Empire, the major campaigns in Europe, or the final destruction of the Jin and Song dynasties in China—his organizational work laid the groundwork for these later conquests. The keshig he commanded and the meritocratic military system he helped implement enabled the campaigns that devastated cities from Baghdad to Kiev.

The use of terror as a systematic military tactic, which characterized Mongol warfare during Borokhula's lifetime, raises moral questions about the commanders who implemented it. The policy of executing entire urban populations to encourage the surrender of subsequent cities, while militarily effective, represented a calculated use of mass murder as a strategic tool.[^83] As one of Genghis Khan's inner council, Borokhula would have participated in strategic discussions that decided the fates of countless civilians. The fact that such tactics were common in medieval warfare does not entirely absolve those who employed them with particular effectiveness.

The campaign against the Tumed tribes that cost Borokhula his life was fundamentally a war of conquest and subjugation. The Forest Peoples of Siberia, including the Tumed, revolted against Mongol authority, suggesting they had not willingly submitted to Mongol rule.[^84] The brutal suppression of this revolt, culminating in the sacrifice of 100 Tumed prisoners, exemplifies the violent incorporation of peoples into the Mongol Empire. While Borokhula died before this vengeance was exacted, his military campaign helped extend Mongol control over peoples who apparently preferred independence.

From a critical perspective on power and hierarchy, the keshig system that Borokhula commanded can be seen as creating a new privileged military caste to replace the old tribal aristocracy. The principle that ordinary keshig soldiers outranked regular army commanders institutionalized inequality and concentrated power in the hands of a small elite surrounding Genghis Khan.[^85] While this elite was theoretically meritocratic, in practice it consisted largely of Genghis Khan's early followers and their descendants—including Borokhula's children, who inherited his command of the guard. This hereditary transmission of privilege suggests that the "meritocracy" was imperfect and that a new aristocracy quickly formed.

Some historians critical of "great man" approaches to history might argue that excessive focus on individual commanders like Borokhula obscures the structural and material factors that enabled Mongol success: superior horse breeding, metallurgy, composite bow technology, and the organizational advantages of nomadic pastoral societies. From this perspective, Borokhula was merely one competent commander among many, his prominence in the sources reflecting elite bias rather than unique contribution.

Feminist historical analysis might note the thoroughly masculine and militaristic nature of the institutional structures Borokhula helped create. While Mongol women enjoyed certain rights and occasionally wielded significant political power—as seen in Genghis Khan's mother Hoelun and later figures like Sorghaghtani Beki—the keshig and military command structure were exclusively male domains that institutionalized patriarchal authority alongside meritocratic principles.

Finally, scholars focused on the perspectives of conquered peoples naturally view Mongol commanders less favorably. Persian, Chinese, and Russian sources from the period describe Mongol invasions as catastrophes that destroyed cities, killed millions, and set back cultural and economic development for generations. While these sources rarely mention Borokhula specifically—he died too early and operated primarily in Mongolia itself rather than in the major conquest campaigns—his role in building the military machine that later devastated their civilizations makes him complicit in their suffering.
