## Overview

AlphaBay was the largest darknet market in history, eclipsing even the original Silk Road. Founded in 2014 by Alexandre Cazes (aka "Alpha02"), a young Canadian genius living a playboy lifestyle in Thailand, it serviced 400,000 users and listed over 300,000 illegal items (drugs, stolen credit cards, malware). It was known for its professional uptime, dispute resolution, and accepting Monero. In July 2017, a massive international operation (Operation Bayonet) seized the site. Cazes was arrested in Bangkok and found dead in his cell (suicide) a week later.

## Operation Bayonet (2017)

### The Trap

**July 4, 2017:**
Thai police (w/ FBI/DEA) rammed the gate of his villa in Bangkok.
**Strategy:** Capture him with **laptop open and unencrypted**.
They caught him while he was administering the server. It was open.

### The Seizure

Police seized:
- 4 Lamborghinis/Porsches.
- Millions in cash.
- Crypto keys on the laptop (access to millions).

### The "Hansa" Trap

Simultaneously, Dutch police seized a rival market, **Hansa**.
Instead of shutting it down, they *ran it secretly* for a month.
When AlphaBay was shut down, thousands of refugees flocked to Hansa. Dutch police collected all their passwords and addresses. Masterstroke.

## The End

**July 12, 2017:**
Cazes found dead in Thai prison cell. Hanging by a towel. Ruled suicide.
He was 25 years old.
