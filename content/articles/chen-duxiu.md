## Summary

Chen Duxiu (1879-1942) was one of the most influential intellectuals in modern Chinese history, co-founding the Chinese Communist Party with Li Dazhao in 1921 and serving as its first General Secretary until 1927.[^1][^2] A leading figure of the New Culture Movement and the May Fourth Movement, Chen championed Western ideals of democracy and science through his groundbreaking magazine New Youth.[^3][^4] His later embrace of Trotskyism led to his expulsion from the CCP in 1929, and he spent his final years in political isolation, ultimately rejecting both communism and nationalism in favor of liberal democracy.[^5][^6]

## Early Life and Background

Chen Duxiu was born on October 9, 1879, in Anqing, Anhui province, into a traditional gentry family.[^7][^8] His father, a minor official and tutor who served in the military office in Manchuria, died when Chen was less than two years old.[^9] After his father's death, Chen was adopted by his paternal uncle, Chen Xifan, a powerful official who amassed considerable wealth, partly through business dealings involving a British firm and soybean exports from Manchuria.[^10] Chen's childhood was shaped by his grandfather, described as an opium-smoking, tyrannical figure who oversaw his early Confucian education.[^11]

Chen received a traditional Confucian education from his grandfather, several private tutors, and his elder brother.[^12] He followed the normal course of Confucian studies for youth and passed the local level of the imperial examinations in 1896 with summa cum laude honors.[^13] In 1897, Chen traveled to Nanjing to attempt the next level of examinations, but the experience proved transformative in an unexpected way. Spending nine days living in a small dormitory with fellow test takers, he witnessed the psychological damage the examination system inflicted on his neighbors and began to doubt its effectiveness.[^14] After failing the examination himself, Chen decided to abandon the exam system entirely, marking the beginning of his departure from traditional Chinese society.[^15]

This rejection of traditional learning led Chen to seek education abroad. In 1902, after delivering speeches against the Qing regime, he fled to Japan and enrolled at Tokyo Higher Normal School.[^16] During his time in Japan, he was exposed to Western ideas and became involved with Chinese student activist groups.[^17] In 1906, he briefly studied at Waseda University, where he came into contact with members of Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang.[^18] These experiences in Japan fundamentally transformed Chen's worldview, introducing him to revolutionary ideas that would shape his future role in Chinese politics and intellectual life.[^19]

## Rise to Power

Chen Duxiu's rise to prominence began with his return to China and his involvement in early revolutionary activities. In 1903, he assisted in establishing the subversive Guomin Riribao ("National Daily News") in Shanghai, though it was quickly suppressed by authorities.[^20] He continued his activism by establishing periodicals promoting the use of vernacular Chinese in writing, a cause that would become central to his later work.[^21] During these early years, Chen moved between China and Japan, teaching at various institutions and participating in revolutionary movements, including the unsuccessful second revolution against President Yuan Shikai in 1913.[^22]

The true turning point in Chen's career came in September 1915, when he founded Youth Magazine (later renamed New Youth) in Shanghai.[^23][^24] This monthly publication became the primary vehicle for the New Culture Movement, proposing that China's youth undertake a vast intellectual, literary, and cultural revolution to rejuvenate the nation.[^25] Chen's influence expanded significantly when he was appointed dean of the School of Letters at Peking University in 1917.[^26] From this prestigious platform, he and his associates—including Hu Shi, Li Dazhao, Lu Xun, and others who joined the editorial board in January 1918—launched a comprehensive critique of traditional Chinese culture and society.[^27]

Chen and his colleagues championed science and democracy, often referred to as "Mr. Science" (Mr. Sai) and "Mr. Democracy" (Mr. De), as solutions to China's problems.[^28][^29] On behalf of New Youth, Chen Duxiu declared: "If I support these two gentlemen, I will not shirk all government oppression, social attacks and ridicule, or even the breaking of my head and the shedding of blood."[^30] They advocated for a literary revolution to replace classical Chinese with vernacular language, and Chen led vigorous attacks on Confucianism, arguing that Confucian ideals were incompatible with a republican constitutional system.[^31][^32]

Chen's leadership reached its zenith during the May Fourth Movement of 1919, when Chairman Mao later praised him as the "general commander" or "commander-in-chief" of the movement.[^33] Chen actively supported the students protesting the Treaty of Versailles and was arrested on June 11, 1919, while distributing leaflets, including his famous article "Guide to Beijing Citizens."[^34] He was imprisoned for 83 days, accused of publishing Bolshevik materials.[^35] During his imprisonment, Chen became increasingly attracted to Marxism, a conversion that would define the next phase of his political career.[^36]

## Major Achievements

Chen Duxiu's most significant achievement was co-founding the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) with Li Dazhao in 1921, with assistance from the Far Eastern Bureau of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Communist International.[^37][^38] At the first representative conference of the CCP in July 1921, Chen was elected as Secretary General, a position he held until 1927.[^39] For seven years, he served as the party's undisputed leader, often regarded as "China's Lenin."[^40]

Under Chen's leadership, the CCP grew from a small group of intellectuals to a significant political force in China. He navigated the complex relationship between the CCP and the Kuomintang during the First United Front period, working to balance revolutionary goals with the pragmatic realities of Chinese politics.[^41] His organizational skills and intellectual leadership were crucial in establishing the party's early structure and ideological foundation.[^42]

Beyond his role in founding the CCP, Chen's contributions to Chinese intellectual life through the New Culture Movement cannot be overstated. New Youth became one of the most influential publications for young radicals in the 1910s and early 1920s, shaping a generation of Chinese intellectuals and political leaders.[^43] Many contributors to the magazine—including Hu Shi, a liberal promoter of vernacular literature; Lu Xun, a leading short-story writer and essayist; and Mao Zedong—later became important intellectual and political leaders.[^44]

Chen's advocacy for the vernacular revolution transformed Chinese literature and education. His interest in vernacular reform was rooted in philological research and the kaozheng tradition, which sought to discover the "lost past."[^45] He believed that etymological research was necessary to establish the original sounds of words and create a true vernacular language, potentially one written with Roman characters.[^46] This work laid the groundwork for the eventual adoption of vernacular Chinese as the standard written language in China.[^47]

The New Culture Movement under Chen's leadership advocated democracy and science while opposing autocracy, ignorance, and superstition. It vigorously promoted new morality against old morality and new literature against old literature, setting off a wave of intellectual emancipation in Chinese society.[^48] Chen's famous assertion that "only Mr. De (Democracy) and Mr. Sai (Science) could save China from all the darkness in politics, morality, academics and ideology" became a rallying cry for reformers.[^49]

Chen's educational reforms and his work at Peking University also represented significant achievements. As dean of the School of Letters and later dean of Peking University, he helped transform the institution into a center of progressive thought and intellectual ferment.[^50] His influence on students and faculty created an environment where new ideas could flourish, contributing to the broader intellectual awakening of early twentieth-century China.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Chen Duxiu's political career was marked by significant controversies, beginning with the catastrophic failure of the First United Front between the CCP and the Kuomintang. The Shanghai Massacre of April 12, 1927, saw violent suppression of Chinese Communist Party organizations and leftist elements by forces supporting General Chiang Kai-shek.[^52] In the year following April 1927, over 300,000 people were killed across China in anti-Communist suppression campaigns carried out by the KMT.[^53] At an emergency CCP conference on August 7, 1927, Chen was made the scapegoat for the United Front's failure and was condemned for "right-wing opportunism."[^54][^55]

The Comintern blamed Chen for the failure of the alliance with the Nationalists and had him officially removed as General Secretary.[^56] Critics argued that Chen and his Soviet advisers, who had promoted cooperation with the KMT, bore responsibility for the disaster that befell the Chinese communist movement.[^57] However, historical analysis suggests that Chen opposed the Comintern's policy of forcing uprisings in the second half of 1927 from a position of extreme weakness, and that he was scapegoated by the Stalinists for decisions largely imposed by Moscow.[^58]

Chen's growing sympathy for Trotskyism following his removal from leadership created further controversy within the communist movement. In July 1929, following Soviet-Chinese clashes over the Chinese Eastern Railway, Chen criticized the CCP's slogan to "Defend the Soviet Union with Arms" as alienating Chinese nationalist sentiment, echoing Trotskyist positions that the revolutionary tide had ebbed.[^59] His open endorsement of Trotskyist views and his call for internal party democracy led the CCP leadership to issue a resolution in June 1929 condemning "residual opportunism" joining with the Trotskyist opposition.[^60] After Chen refused to write an attack on the Trotskyists, he and his followers were expelled from the CCP on November 15, 1929.[^61]

Following his expulsion, Chen became the leader of the Chinese Trotskyist movement. On December 25, 1929, he and his supporters issued "Our Political Views," a statement attacking the Stalinist leadership of the CCP.[^62] His faction, the Proletarian Society, became the largest of several Trotskyist groups.[^63] In CCP historiography, Chen Duxiu's role has often been minimized, portraying him as an "arch-renegade."[^64]

Chen's arrest by the foreign administration of Shanghai on October 15, 1932 (some sources cite October 13), and his subsequent trial by the Nationalist government, generated additional controversy.[^65] He was extradited to Nanking and sentenced to either 13 or 15 years in prison (sources vary) for treasonable activities.[^66] However, Chen's trial in 1933 became a platform for him to eloquently defend his actions, arguing that his opposition to the Kuomintang government was intended to aid China by eliminating an organization that failed to defend against Japanese aggression.[^67]

A smear campaign launched by the Stalinist CCP faction led by Wang Ming accused Chen of being a Japanese traitor, making any reconciliation with the CCP impossible.[^68] While Mao offered Chen reentry if he renounced Trotskyism and admitted past mistakes, Chen found the terms unacceptable.[^69] These controversies have shaped Chen's historical reputation, with different factions emphasizing different aspects of his career to support their own political positions.[^70]

## Personal Life

Chen Duxiu's personal life was marked by tragedy and complexity. He had at least three wives over the course of his lifetime.[^71] His third wife was Pan Lanzhen, who accompanied him during his later years.[^72] Gao Junman, one of Chen's wives, played a significant role not only in helping Chen edit and publish the famous New Youth magazine but also in his revolutionary activities, liaising with comrades and covering for Chen's underground work.[^73]

Chen had several children, including Chen Yannian, Chen Qiaonian, Chen Songnian, and Chen Yuying.[^74] The fate of his eldest sons represents one of the great personal tragedies of Chen's life. Both Chen Yannian and Chen Qiaonian became revolutionary leaders and close comrades of their father, but both died young during the collapse of the United Front.[^75] Chen Qiaonian died on June 6, 1928.[^76] The loss of his two eldest sons deeply affected Chen and occurred during the period when he himself was being blamed for the United Front's failure.[^77]

In his later years, Chen lived simply with his third wife Pan Lanzhen, his stepmother, older sister, and third son Chen Songnian.[^78] Despite his revolutionary activities and political prominence, Chen maintained scholarly pursuits throughout his life. During difficult periods, including his imprisonment from 1932 to 1937, he was allowed to continue his philological research and begin his autobiography.[^79] Philological research became "a familiar solace in times of despair" for Chen.[^80]

Chen's personality combined intellectual rigor with passionate conviction. His early interest in obscure characters hinted at an inclination toward the kaozheng (evidential research) school of scholarship, known for its critical approach to neo-Confucian orthodoxy.[^81] This scholarly temperament coexisted with a fierce commitment to revolutionary change. His famous declaration about supporting democracy and science—that he would not shirk "all government oppression, social attacks and ridicule, or even the breaking of my head and the shedding of blood"—reveals the depth of his convictions.[^82]

Chen's final years were spent in relative political isolation in China's wartime capital region. He retreated to the village of Jiangjin near Chongqing, where his health declined from high blood pressure and heart disease.[^83] During this period, he attempted to reconcile Marxism with his earlier democratic ideals and continued his philological research.[^84] He died on May 27, 1942, at the age of 62, with the nation's fortunes again at a low ebb.[^85]

## Legacy

Chen Duxiu's legacy remains one of the most complex and contested in modern Chinese history. As a founder of the Chinese Communist Party and a pivotal figure in modern Chinese intellectual and revolutionary history, his influence extends far beyond his lifetime.[^86] His role in the New Culture Movement and the May Fourth Movement fundamentally transformed Chinese intellectual life and set the stage for the revolutionary changes that followed.[^87]

Chen's most enduring legacy lies in the continuing tradition of student activism and the persistent desire for democratic reforms within China, often championed by those in cultural and literary circles.[^88] The intellectual awakening he helped spark through New Youth magazine created a generation of thinkers who questioned traditional authority and sought new paths for China's development.[^89] Many of the young writers who contributed to New Youth—including Hu Shi, Lu Xun, Li Dazhao, and Mao Zedong—became important intellectual and political leaders, carrying forward the spirit of critical inquiry and reform.[^90]

The vernacular revolution that Chen championed fundamentally changed Chinese literature and education. His advocacy for replacing classical Chinese with vernacular language succeeded, making literature and learning accessible to broader segments of Chinese society.[^91] This democratization of written Chinese represents one of his most concrete and lasting achievements.[^92]

Chen's final political evolution—his rejection of both Stalinism and Trotskyism in favor of Western parliamentary democracy and constitutionalism—represents a significant but often overlooked aspect of his legacy.[^93] He condemned Stalin's tyranny and theoretically forsook proletarian dictatorship as the path toward socialism, ultimately coming to see Western parliamentary democracy and constitutionalism as China's new hope.[^94] This intellectual journey from traditional Confucianism to revolutionary communism to liberal democracy reflects the broader struggles of Chinese intellectuals in the twentieth century to find an appropriate path for modernization.[^95]

Since the 1980s, there has been a revival of interest in Chen within China, with scholars questioning the official narratives surrounding his expulsion from the CCP and acknowledging his profound influence on the course of modern Chinese history.[^96] This reassessment represents a partial rehabilitation of his reputation, though he remains a controversial figure.[^97] His legacy is seen differently by different groups: to some, he is a pioneering revolutionary and intellectual giant; to others, he is a cautionary tale of political mistakes and ideological wavering.[^98]

Chen's scholarly contributions, particularly his philological research, represent another dimension of his legacy. His work in Chinese linguistics and his interest in the kaozheng tradition of evidential research influenced later scholarship.[^99] Even during imprisonment and political isolation, Chen maintained his commitment to scholarly inquiry, demonstrating that intellectual pursuit could transcend political circumstance.[^100]

Perhaps most significantly, Chen Duxiu's life and work embody the tensions and contradictions of China's modern transformation. His journey from traditional scholar to revolutionary leader to political outcast to liberal democrat mirrors China's own tumultuous search for modernity.[^101] His willingness to question authority, revise his views, and maintain intellectual independence—even at great personal cost—stands as an example of intellectual courage and integrity.[^102]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many scholars and historians view Chen Duxiu as one of the most important intellectual figures in modern Chinese history, whose contributions to China's modernization were profound and lasting. His role as the "general commander" of the May Fourth Movement, as Mao himself acknowledged, placed him at the center of China's intellectual awakening.[^103] Historians credit Chen with helping to break the hold of traditional Confucian thought on Chinese society and opening the way for new ideas and approaches to governance and culture.[^104]

Supporters emphasize Chen's intellectual courage and his willingness to champion unpopular ideas. His attacks on Confucianism, while controversial, were seen by many as necessary to free China from outdated social structures that hindered modernization.[^105] As he wrote of New Youth's editorial policies: "Critics accuse this magazine of intending to destroy Confucianism. These charges are conceded."[^106] This forthright approach to ideological struggle has been praised as intellectually honest and politically courageous.[^107]

Chen's advocacy for democracy and science—"Mr. De and Mr. Sai"—is viewed by many as visionary, anticipating the values that would eventually become central to global development.[^108] His famous question to his readers, "The society of my country, will it prosper? Or is it doomed?" reflected a genuine concern for China's future and a willingness to confront uncomfortable truths.[^109] His belief that "only Mr. De (Democracy) and Mr. Sai (Science) could save China from all the darkness in politics, morality, academics and ideology" articulated a clear vision for modernization.[^110]

Progressive historians view Chen's later embrace of liberal democracy as prescient rather than retrograde. His condemnation of Stalin's tyranny and his rejection of proletarian dictatorship demonstrated an ability to learn from experience and revise his views in light of new evidence.[^111] His final realization that "neither Leninism nor Trotskyism was a solution to China's problems" and his turn toward "Western parliamentary democracy and constitutionalism as China's new hope" showed intellectual growth and independence.[^112]

The revival of interest in Chen since the 1980s has led scholars to question official narratives and acknowledge his profound influence on modern Chinese history.[^113] Many now see him as a tragic figure who was scapegoated for failures that were not primarily his responsibility, particularly regarding the collapse of the First United Front.[^114] Scholars argue that decisions imposed by Moscow, rather than Chen's leadership, led to the disasters of 1927.[^115]

Chen's contributions to Chinese linguistics and his philological research are also recognized as significant scholarly achievements. His work in promoting the vernacular revolution and his interest in the kaozheng tradition of evidential research influenced later developments in Chinese language and literature.[^116] His ability to combine scholarly rigor with political activism has been praised as exemplifying the engaged intellectual.[^117]

### Negative Views

Critics of Chen Duxiu focus on his political failures and what they see as ideological inconsistency. The official CCP historiography has often portrayed him as an "arch-renegade" whose "right-wing opportunism" led to the catastrophic failures of 1927.[^118] From this perspective, Chen's leadership during the First United Front period showed poor judgment and an inability to understand the true nature of class struggle in China.[^119]

The expulsion of Chen from the CCP and the violent suppression of communists in 1927, resulting in over 300,000 deaths, is seen by critics as a direct consequence of his failed policies and excessive trust in the Kuomintang.[^120] While some historians argue that Chen was scapegoated for decisions imposed by Moscow, critics maintain that as the leader of the CCP, he bore ultimate responsibility for the party's direction and should have resisted misguided Comintern directives more forcefully.[^121]

Chen's embrace of Trotskyism after his expulsion from the CCP is viewed negatively by many in China, where Trotskyism has been associated with factionalism and opposition to national unity.[^122] The Stalinist CCP faction led by Wang Ming launched a smear campaign accusing Chen of being a Japanese traitor, and while these accusations were false, they reflected genuine concerns about the divisive impact of Trotskyist factionalism on the Chinese communist movement.[^123]

Critics also point to what they see as Chen's intellectual inconsistency, moving from traditional Confucianism to revolutionary communism to Trotskyism to liberal democracy. From this perspective, Chen's ideological journey reflects an inability to commit fully to any single vision, suggesting political opportunism or intellectual confusion rather than growth.[^124] His final rejection of communism in favor of Western parliamentary democracy is seen by some as a betrayal of the revolutionary cause to which he had dedicated much of his life.[^125]

Some historians criticize Chen's attacks on Confucianism as excessive and destructive, arguing that he helped create an intellectual vacuum that contributed to later extremism.[^126] His declaration that New Youth intended to destroy Confucianism, while intellectually honest, demonstrated a lack of appreciation for the valuable elements of Chinese traditional culture that could have been adapted rather than rejected wholesale.[^127]

Chen's personal failures as a leader are also noted by critics. His inability to maintain unity within the CCP, his conflicts with other leaders, and his eventual isolation from mainstream Chinese politics suggest deficiencies in political skill and temperament.[^128] The fact that Mao offered Chen reentry to the CCP if he renounced Trotskyism and admitted past mistakes, but Chen found the terms unacceptable, is seen by some as evidence of excessive pride and stubbornness.[^129]
