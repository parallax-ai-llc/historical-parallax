## Summary

Walpola Rahula was a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk and scholar whose book What the Buddha Taught became one of the most widely read introductions to Buddhism. He was the first monk to receive a PhD from a Western university (the Sorbonne). He challenged the notion that monks should withdraw from society, advocating for engaged Buddhism. His clear, accessible writing style brought Theravada Buddhism to a global audience.
