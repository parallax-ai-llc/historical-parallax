## Summary

Kim Jong-un is the Supreme Leader of North Korea and has ruled the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) since December 2011, following the death of his father Kim Jong-il[^1]. As the third generation of the Kim dynasty, he inherited a totalitarian state founded by his grandfather Kim Il-sung and has consolidated absolute power through purges, executions, and institutional control[^2]. During his rule, he has dramatically accelerated North Korea's nuclear weapons program, conducted numerous missile tests, and maintained one of the world's most repressive human rights regimes[^3][^4]. Despite periodic diplomatic engagement with South Korea, China, and the United States, Kim has prioritized military development over economic reform, leaving North Korea internationally isolated and economically struggling[^5][^6].

## Early Life and Background

Kim Jong-un was born on January 8, 1984, though significant uncertainty surrounds his exact birth year, with some sources suggesting 1982 or 1983[^1][^7]. The discrepancies may be deliberate; it is believed that his official birth year was changed for symbolic reasons, as 1982 marked the seventieth birthday of his grandfather Kim Il-sung and forty years after the official birth of his father Kim Jong-il[^1]. He is the third son of Kim Jong-il, North Korea's second supreme leader, and Ko Yong-hui, a Japanese-born opera singer who became Kim Jong-il's third consort after immigrating to North Korea during the 1960s[^7][^8]. Kim Jong-un has two siblings from the same mother: an elder brother, Kim Jong-chul (born September 25, 1981), and a younger sister, Kim Yo-jong (born approximately 1987), who would later become a powerful political figure in her own right[^1][^8].

As a member of the ruling Kim family—often referred to as the "Mount Paektu bloodline" in North Korean propaganda—Kim Jong-un was groomed from childhood for leadership, though he lived largely out of public view during his early years[^7]. His mother, Ko Yong-hui, reportedly held significant influence over succession plans before her death in 2004, advocating for Kim Jong-un over his elder brothers[^8]. Little concrete information exists about his early childhood in North Korea, as the regime maintains strict secrecy about the personal lives of the ruling family. What is known suggests a privileged upbringing within the isolated elite of Pyongyang, insulated from the hardships faced by ordinary North Korean citizens.

In the mid-1990s, Kim Jong-un was sent abroad for education, attending school in Switzerland under the pseudonym "Pak Un" to conceal his identity[^9][^10]. He studied at the Liebefeld-Steinhölzli Schule, a German-language state school in Köniz near Bern, from 1998 to 2000, where he was registered as the son of a North Korean embassy employee[^9]. A former classmate, Joao Micaelo, later recalled that the young Kim was passionate about basketball, playing the sport constantly and enjoying basketball video games on his PlayStation[^9][^10]. He also reportedly attended the private International School of Berne in Gümligen for a period[^7][^10]. These years in Switzerland exposed him to Western culture and lifestyle, though the extent to which this influenced his worldview remains unclear. He returned to North Korea around 2000, where he continued his education at Kim Il-sung Military University and later attended the Kim Il-sung National War College from 2002 to 2007, receiving military and political training in preparation for eventual leadership[^7][^8].

## Rise to Power

Kim Jong-un's path to supreme leadership was remarkably compressed compared to his father's decades-long preparation for power[^11]. The succession process began in earnest in 2009 when South Korean intelligence agencies reported that Kim Jong-il had designated his youngest son as his heir, bypassing the elder brothers who were considered unsuitable for various reasons—Kim Jong-nam due to his public embarrassment of the regime and preference for reform, and Kim Jong-chul for being deemed too weak or effeminate by his father[^11][^12]. From 2009 onward, Kim Jong-un underwent rapid political and military elevation designed to establish his credentials and legitimacy as the next leader of North Korea.

The public unveiling of Kim Jong-un as successor came in September 2010 during a rare Workers' Party conference. On September 27, 2010, despite having no previous military experience, he was suddenly promoted to the rank of four-star general[^2][^11]. The following day, September 28, 2010, he was appointed vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and given membership in the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, positions that placed him at the center of North Korea's power structure[^2][^11]. These appointments marked the first time most North Koreans and the international community learned of Kim Jong-un's existence and future role. State media immediately began cultivating his image, comparing him favorably to his grandfather Kim Il-sung and emphasizing his military brilliance despite his youth and lack of experience.

On February 10, 2011, Kim Jong-un received another crucial appointment as Vice Chairman of the National Defense Commission, further cementing his position as heir apparent[^11]. When Kim Jong-il died suddenly on December 17, 2011—reportedly from a heart attack while traveling by train—the succession mechanism activated swiftly[^2][^11]. Kim Jong-un, then only 27 or 28 years old, was immediately positioned as the new leader. On December 24, 2011, he was publicly declared Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and this appointment was formalized on December 30, 2011[^2][^11]. During the elaborate state funeral for Kim Jong-il on December 28, 2011, Kim Jong-un was prominently featured walking beside his father's hearse, a symbolic gesture demonstrating his role as the legitimate successor and protector of the Kim dynasty's legacy.

Throughout 2012, Kim Jong-un consolidated his formal titles and began eliminating potential rivals. In April 2012, his status was validated through acquisition of several key positions: First Secretary of the Korean Workers' Party, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and Chairman of the National Defense Commission—effectively controlling the party, military, and state apparatus[^2][^11]. He was also promoted to wonsu (marshal), the highest military rank in North Korea[^13]. The period from 2012 to 2014 became known as the "purge era," during which Kim systematically removed officials appointed by his father and eliminated those he perceived as threats[^13]. The most shocking purge came in December 2013 when his uncle Jang Song-thaek, once considered the regime's second-most powerful figure and a mentor to Kim, was arrested, publicly denounced as a traitor, and executed along with several family members who held government positions[^13]. This ruthless consolidation of power demonstrated that despite his youth and inexperience, Kim Jong-un would tolerate no challenges to his absolute authority.

## Major Achievements

Kim Jong-un's primary accomplishments during his rule have centered on dramatically advancing North Korea's military capabilities, particularly its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Upon assuming power, he adopted the byungjin policy of simultaneous economic and nuclear development, signaling his intention to transform North Korea into a recognized nuclear state while pursuing economic modernization[^14][^15]. This represented a departure from his father's "military-first" songun policy, though in practice military development remained the clear priority. Between 2011 and 2025, North Korea conducted numerous nuclear tests and hundreds of missile launches, achieving technological breakthroughs that fundamentally altered the strategic balance in Northeast Asia.

The nuclear weapons program saw dramatic acceleration under Kim Jong-un's leadership. In February 2013, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test, the first under Kim's rule, and the pace of underground detonations intensified thereafter[^14]. By 2017, North Korea had conducted a total of six nuclear tests, with the final test in September 2017 reportedly involving a thermonuclear device (hydrogen bomb) with an estimated yield of 100-370 kilotons[^14][^15]. North Korean officials claimed this device was compact enough to mount on an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)[^14]. Current estimates suggest North Korea possesses around 50 nuclear warheads with sufficient fissile material for up to 90 weapons[^15]. In January 2021, Kim announced that North Korea had achieved the ability to "miniaturize, lighten and standardize nuclear weapons and to make them tactical ones"[^15]. The regime unveiled purported tactical nuclear warheads claimed to be compatible with at least eight delivery systems, including cruise missiles and an unmanned underwater vehicle[^15].

Parallel advances in missile technology transformed North Korea's strategic reach. Kim's regime tested and deployed various missile systems including short-range ballistic missiles (SRBMs), medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and critically, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the continental United States[^14][^15]. In July 2017, North Korea successfully tested the Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 ICBMs, with the latter demonstrating sufficient range to "easily reach a number of major US cities"[^13]. In September 2021, North Korea claimed to have tested its first hypersonic missile, the Hwasong-8[^13]. These achievements, while imposing enormous costs on the impoverished nation, established North Korea as a de facto nuclear state and provided Kim with his primary source of leverage in international relations.

Beyond military achievements, Kim has pursued selective economic and social reforms, though with limited success. He introduced elements of market mechanisms in agriculture through the "socialist corporate responsible management system" and permitted greater autonomy for state enterprises[^16]. Infrastructure projects in Pyongyang—including new apartment complexes, a ski resort, water parks, and the renovation of public spaces—were designed to showcase regime legitimacy and provide amenities to the loyal elite[^16]. Kim also demonstrated slightly more openness to popular culture, allowing performances featuring Disney characters and Western musical instruments, though within strict limits[^17]. In 2018-2019, he achieved perhaps his most significant diplomatic accomplishment by conducting unprecedented summit diplomacy with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and U.S. President Donald Trump, temporarily easing tensions and gaining international recognition as a legitimate negotiating partner[^13][^18].

In January 2021, Kim announced an ambitious Five-Year Defense Plan to field nuclear-capable submarines, develop tactical nuclear weapons, deploy multiple warheads on single missiles (MIRVs), and improve ICBM accuracy[^15]. In September 2023, he declared intentions to boost nuclear weapons production "exponentially" and diversify nuclear strike options[^15]. During visits to nuclear weapons institutes in January 2025, Kim characterized the year as "crucial" for "bolstering up the nuclear forces" and emphasized "overfulfilling the plan for producing weapons-grade nuclear materials"[^15]. These statements indicate continued prioritization of military capabilities as the central achievement and legacy of his rule, following the path established by his grandfather and father in building North Korea's identity as a military-first state.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Kim Jong-un's rule has been characterized by systematic human rights violations on a scale that international organizations have described as unparalleled in the contemporary world. His totalitarian government violates fundamental rights and freedoms including freedom of expression, religion, movement, and association, while subjecting citizens to threats of execution, imprisonment, enforced disappearance, and forced labor[^19]. The regime operates a vast system of political prison camps (kwanliso) where an estimated 80,000-120,000 prisoners are held in brutal conditions characterized by starvation, torture, forced labor, sexual violence, and summary executions[^19][^20]. During the ten years since assuming power, Kim expanded invasive surveillance and repression of North Koreans, denied people freedom of movement within the country and across borders, and responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with policies that heightened food insecurity and threatened widespread starvation[^20].

A particularly disturbing development under Kim's rule has been the rollout of laws focused on heightened control of language, thought, and culture, including the Law on Rejecting Reactionary Thought and Culture (2020), the Youth Education Guarantee Law (2021), and the Law on Protecting the Pyongyang Cultural Language (2023)[^20]. For the first time, these laws impose the death penalty for violations such as consuming South Korean media or using South Korean speech patterns[^20]. Public executions have reportedly increased following implementation of these laws, with defectors describing systematic campaigns to eliminate "impure" cultural influences[^20]. More than 40 percent of North Koreans are malnourished, and more than 10 million people need humanitarian aid, yet the government has refused to accept international assistance or cooperate with humanitarian agencies due to mistrust of outsiders and fear of exposing its human rights violations[^20].

The regime's willingness to use assassination and purges to eliminate perceived threats has shocked international observers. In February 2017, Kim's half-brother Kim Jong-nam was assassinated with the VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia, an operation widely attributed to North Korean agents acting on Kim Jong-un's orders[^13]. This brazen use of a chemical weapon of mass destruction in a public international airport demonstrated the regime's ruthlessness and disregard for international norms. Between 2011 and 2015, South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se reported that Kim had executed at least 70 officials, including senior military leaders and party officials, in a campaign to consolidate power and instill fear among the elite[^13]. The execution of Jang Song-thaek in 2013, carried out with extreme brutality according to some reports, sent a chilling message that family connections offered no protection from Kim's wrath.

International sanctions targeting North Korea's nuclear program and human rights abuses have intensified under Kim's rule. On July 6, 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Kim Jong-un personally and other senior officials for human rights violations, marking the first time Washington had directly sanctioned North Korea's leader[^13][^21]. The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in North Korea and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights have strongly recommended that the Security Council refer North Korea to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation into crimes against humanity, which would strip Kim of international immunity and make him subject to arrest and prosecution[^20]. These calls reflect the international community's assessment that human rights violations in North Korea constitute systematic and widespread crimes that may meet the definition of crimes against humanity under international law.

Critics have also highlighted the massive disconnect between Kim's military spending and the suffering of ordinary North Koreans. Despite chronic food shortages, a collapsing healthcare system, and dire humanitarian needs, the regime diverts scarce resources to nuclear weapons development and vanity projects like luxury ski resorts for the elite[^22]. Kim's personality cult, modeled on those of his grandfather and father, demands absolute loyalty and worship, with citizens required to display portraits of the Kim family in their homes and participate in elaborate rituals of devotion[^23]. Educational systems function primarily as indoctrination mechanisms, teaching children from infancy that the Kim family possesses divine qualities and that absolute obedience to the leader is the highest virtue. This system of ideological control, combined with pervasive surveillance and severe punishment for dissent, creates a totalitarian environment that denies citizens basic human dignity and autonomy.

## Personal Life

Kim Jong-un married Ri Sol-ju, who became the First Lady of North Korea, though details about their relationship and marriage remain shrouded in secrecy[^24][^25]. Reports suggest they married in 2009, but Ri's identity as Kim's wife only became publicly known in July 2012 when she began appearing alongside him at official events[^24]. Ri Sol-ju's reported birth year ranges between 1985 and 1989, making her several years younger than her husband[^24]. According to available information, Ri comes from an elite political family; her mother reportedly heads a gynecology ward and her father is a professor[^24]. She studied abroad in China, majoring in vocal music, and attended Geumsung 2 Middle School in Pyongyang[^24]. Some sources suggest she may have been a member of the Unhasu Orchestra and possibly a cheerleader for North Korean sports teams before her marriage, though these details cannot be independently confirmed.

In April 2018, state media announced that Ri Sol-ju's title had been elevated from merely "Comrade" to "Respected First Lady," considered a significant honor and the first time the title had been used since 1974[^24]. This elevation suggested Kim was granting his wife greater public prominence and possibly a more substantive political role, departing from his father's practice of keeping consorts almost entirely hidden from public view. Ri has accompanied Kim on diplomatic visits, including the historic summits with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, presenting a more modern and accessible image of the North Korean leadership to both domestic and international audiences.

Kim and Ri are believed to have three children, though the North Korean regime has never officially confirmed this[^25][^26]. The eldest child is reportedly a son, possibly born in 2010 according to some sources[^25]. This information became public when former NBA basketball player Dennis Rodman, who developed an unusual friendship with Kim Jong-un, told The Guardian in September 2013 that he had held the couple's baby daughter, named Kim Ju-ae[^25]. The second child, Kim Ju-ae, has become increasingly visible in recent years, making public appearances at military events, missile launches, and state functions beginning in 2022[^25][^26]. Her prominence has fueled speculation that she might be positioned as a potential successor, though she remains very young. South Korean intelligence officials reported that Ri gave birth to a third child of unknown gender in February 2017, but virtually nothing is known about this child[^25].

Kim Jong-un's personal interests reportedly include basketball, particularly the NBA, which stems from his time in Switzerland where he became a devoted fan[^9][^10]. His friendship with Dennis Rodman, who made several visits to North Korea and attended basketball games with Kim, revealed a more informal and personable side that contrasts sharply with his public image as a ruthless dictator. Kim is known to be a heavy smoker, frequently photographed with cigarettes despite North Korea's nominal public health campaigns against smoking. His weight and health have been subjects of international speculation, with noticeable fluctuations observed over the years and periods where he disappeared from public view, triggering rumors about serious health problems[^27]. The regime's extreme secrecy about the leader's personal life means that much information comes from defectors, intelligence agencies, and occasional foreign visitors, making it difficult to distinguish fact from speculation or propaganda.

## Legacy

Kim Jong-un's legacy after more than thirteen years in power is fundamentally shaped by his prioritization of nuclear weapons development and military might over economic development and the welfare of North Korean citizens. His primary accomplishment—establishing North Korea as a nuclear-armed state with intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities—has fundamentally altered the strategic landscape of Northeast Asia and achieved the regime's long-sought goal of becoming a recognized nuclear power[^14][^15][^28]. This achievement provided North Korea with deterrence against external threats and leverage in international negotiations, fulfilling the military legacy his grandfather and father began. However, this came at enormous cost to the North Korean people, who endured continued poverty, repression, and international isolation as resources were diverted to weapons programs.

Analysts at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace have argued that Kim's lasting legacy will be "the hollowing out of North Korea" and a people who are poorer than when he assumed power in 2011[^22]. After thirteen years of leadership, "Kim has nothing to show for his thirteen years of stewardship other than more hardships for his people, an economy that continues to tank, and a regime set on making more nuclear weapons and missiles"[^22]. The COVID-19 pandemic, which led Kim to seal North Korea's borders completely from early 2020 through 2023, devastated an already fragile economy dependent on trade with China, exacerbating food shortages and humanitarian crises[^20][^22]. The regime's refusal to accept international humanitarian assistance or COVID vaccines, driven by fears of outside influence, demonstrated how ideological control and regime survival take absolute precedence over citizen welfare.

Kim's consolidation of personal power represents both continuity and change within the Kim dynasty's rule. Unlike his father, who shared power somewhat with military leaders and party officials, Kim Jong-un eliminated potential rivals ruthlessly and centralized decision-making authority in his own hands[^29]. A scholarly study examining elite appointments found that "despite concerns about stability in the early days of the Kim Jong Un regime, he has firmly established his control over the existing system"[^29]. He regularized governing mechanisms of the Workers' Party of Korea, giving it greater prominence relative to the military compared to his father's "military-first" era[^18][^29]. This institutional restructuring may provide greater stability for the regime in the long term, though it reinforces the totalitarian nature of the system.

The central dilemma shaping Kim's foreign policy throughout his first decade in power—and likely to define his legacy—revolves around ensuring North Korea's prosperity and security while sustaining the political isolation and control necessary for regime survival[^30]. His engagement in summit diplomacy with South Korea and the United States in 2018-2019 represented unprecedented personal diplomacy for a North Korean leader, temporarily raising hopes for denuclearization and peace[^13][^18]. However, the failure of these diplomatic efforts and subsequent return to weapons testing and hostile rhetoric demonstrated the fundamental contradiction: the regime's survival depends on both its nuclear deterrent and its ideological isolation, making genuine opening or reform existential threats to the system Kim inherited and has reinforced.

Looking forward, Kim Jong-un's legacy will likely be assessed based on whether his nuclear gambit achieves long-term security and prosperity for North Korea or whether it results in continued stagnation, suffering, and potential catastrophic conflict. His refusal to pursue Chinese or Vietnamese models of market reform while maintaining party control suggests he believes economic opening poses unacceptable risks to regime stability. The systematic intensification of ideological controls, surveillance, and punishment under his rule indicates he sees external influence as a fundamental threat requiring constant vigilance and repression. Whether future generations of North Koreans will view him as the leader who secured their nation's sovereignty and strength, or as the dictator who squandered opportunities and perpetuated their suffering, remains to be determined by events yet to unfold.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Kim Jong-un's leadership, primarily found within the North Korean state apparatus and among sympathetic observers in some authoritarian states, emphasize his success in achieving nuclear weapons capability as a legitimate exercise of national sovereignty and self-defense. From this perspective, Kim fulfilled the strategic vision of his grandfather and father by developing a credible nuclear deterrent that prevents foreign military intervention and preserves North Korean independence in the face of hostile encirclement by the United States and its allies[^15][^28]. Proponents argue that North Korea's nuclear program, however costly, represents a rational response to genuine security threats, pointing to the fates of non-nuclear states like Iraq and Libya that gave up weapons programs and subsequently faced military intervention and regime change.

Some analysts credit Kim with demonstrating greater political skill and adaptability than initially expected when he assumed power as an inexperienced leader in his late twenties. His rapid consolidation of power, elimination of potential rivals, and establishment of personal authority over the party, military, and state apparatus demonstrated political acumen that defied predictions of regime instability or collapse[^29]. Scholars studying North Korean elite politics have noted that Kim successfully navigated the challenges of succession and established firm control over the existing system, providing a degree of regime stability[^29]. His willingness to engage in unprecedented summit diplomacy with South Korea and the United States showed flexibility and tactical sophistication, even if these diplomatic openings ultimately failed to produce lasting agreements[^13][^18].

Within North Korea's official narrative, Kim Jong-un is portrayed as a brilliant leader, caring father of the nation, and strategic genius who has elevated North Korea's international standing and protected the country from external enemies. State propaganda emphasizes his economic initiatives, construction projects, and visits to farms and factories as evidence of his concern for people's livelihoods[^16][^17]. The personality cult surrounding Kim presents him as embodying the virtues of his grandfather Kim Il-sung while bringing youthful energy and modern sensibilities to leadership. Official media credits him personally with scientific and military breakthroughs, presenting him as a Renaissance figure with expertise ranging from nuclear physics to agricultural science to military strategy. For regime loyalists and those whose livelihoods depend on the system, Kim represents continuity, stability, and national pride in the face of foreign pressure.

Some observers in China and Russia view Kim pragmatically as a stabilizing force who maintains a buffer state between their borders and U.S.-allied South Korea, preventing potential instability that could result from regime collapse. From this geopolitical perspective, Kim's leadership, however repressive, serves regional stability by preventing humanitarian disasters, refugee crises, and potential military conflicts that would arise from North Korean state failure. These views, while not morally endorsing Kim's human rights record, recognize the complex regional dynamics that make his continued rule preferable to certain alternatives from the perspective of neighboring powers.

### Negative Views

International human rights organizations, Western governments, defectors, and many scholars provide devastating assessments of Kim Jong-un's leadership, characterizing his rule as one of the most repressive and brutal regimes in the contemporary world. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the United Nations have documented systematic violations of fundamental human rights including arbitrary detention, torture, forced labor, public executions, and crimes against humanity[^19][^20]. The UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in the DPRK concluded that North Korea commits human rights violations "without parallel in the contemporary world," with systematic patterns that may constitute crimes against humanity warranting International Criminal Court prosecution[^20]. Critics emphasize that Kim has not merely continued his father's repressive policies but has intensified ideological control through new laws imposing death penalties for cultural violations and has expanded surveillance mechanisms[^20].

The assessment from the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace epitomizes scholarly criticism: "Kim's lasting legacy will be the hollowing out of North Korea and a people who are poorer than when he assumed power in 2011"[^22]. This analysis argues that after thirteen years in power, Kim has failed to deliver on promises of economic prosperity, instead presiding over continued economic decline, food insecurity affecting millions, and deteriorating living standards for ordinary citizens while resources flow to weapons programs and elite privileges[^22]. Critics point to the fundamental moral failure of a leader who prioritizes nuclear weapons and vanity projects while more than 40 percent of his population suffers from malnutrition and millions lack access to basic healthcare, clean water, and adequate housing[^20].

Kim's use of assassination, purges, and public executions to maintain power has drawn particular condemnation. The 2017 assassination of Kim Jong-nam using a chemical weapon in an international airport, the brutal execution of Kim's uncle Jang Song-thaek, and reports of at least 70 high-level executions by 2015 demonstrate a ruthlessness that shocks even observers accustomed to authoritarian brutality[^13]. Human rights advocates emphasize that these high-profile killings represent only the visible tip of a vast system of violence that claims countless ordinary North Korean lives through starvation in prison camps, execution for minor offenses like watching foreign media, and deaths from preventable diseases due to collapsed healthcare systems.

Diplomatic analysts criticize Kim's approach to international relations as fundamentally dishonest and destructive. His periodic engagement in diplomacy—including the 2018-2019 summits with South Korea and the United States—is viewed by many critics as tactical deception designed to extract concessions, buy time for weapons development, and divide the international coalition maintaining sanctions pressure[^18]. The failure of these diplomatic initiatives, attributed by critics to Kim's unwillingness to genuinely consider denuclearization, represented a squandered opportunity that may not recur and demonstrated bad faith that undermines future diplomatic efforts. North Korean defectors, whose testimonies provide some of the most detailed accounts of life under Kim's rule, almost universally describe a nightmare state where citizens live in constant fear, where children are indoctrinated from birth to worship the Kim family, and where the vast majority of the population survives rather than lives, denied basic freedoms that people elsewhere take for granted[^20][^31].
