## Summary

Vladimir Potanin is the president of Nornickel, the world's largest producer of nickel and palladium. He acquired his fortune through the controversial 'loans for shares' privatization scheme in the 1990s, which transferred state assets to oligarchs at below-market prices. Nornickel is critical to the global battery and electric vehicle supply chain. He has largely avoided Western sanctions despite Russia's conflicts.
