## Overview

The Bernard Madoff investment scandal was the largest Ponzi scheme in history. For decades, Bernie Madoff, a respected Wall Street financier and former chairman of the NASDAQ, ran a massive fraud disguised as a wealth management business. He promised consistent, steady returns to thousands of investors—including charities, universities, celebrities, and retirees. In reality, he never invested a dime of their money. He simply deposited client funds into a Chase bank account and used new money to pay off old investors. The scheme collapsed in December 2008 during the global financial crisis. The paper loss was $64.8 billion.

## Background

### Bernie Madoff

**Reputation:**
- Founded Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (1960).
- Pioneer of electronic trading (helped create NASDAQ).
- Served as NASDAQ Chairman.
- Regarded as a trustworthy "Jewish statesman" of Wall Street.

**The Strategy (The Lie):**
Claimed to use a "split-strike conversion" strategy (buying stocks and options) to generate steady 10-12% returns, regardless of market conditions.
**The Reality:**
He stopped trading in the 1990s (or earlier). He faked trade confirmations and monthly statements using a dot-matrix printer on his office's 17th floor.

## The Growth

### Exclusivity

Madoff created an aura of exclusivity. People begged to invest with him.
"Feeder funds" (like Fairfield Greenwich) funneled billions to him, taking fees for doing zero due diligence.

### Harry Markopolos

**The Whistleblower:**
Quantitative analyst who figured out Madoff was a fraud in 1999. The math was impossible (returns were too smooth).
**Ignored:**
Sent detailed reports to the SEC five times (2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008). SEC incompetent/ignored him. "The World's Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud."

---

## The Collapse (2008)

### The Crunch

**Financial Crisis:**
Lehman Brothers collapsed (Sept 2008). Markets crashed.
Investors needed cash. Madoff faced $7 billion in redemption requests.
He only had a few hundred million left.

### The Confession (December 10, 2008)

Madoff told his sons, Mark and Andrew, that the whole business was "one big lie." A "giant Ponzi scheme."
Sons reported him to FBI (on advice of lawyers).

### Arrest (December 11, 2008)

FBI raided his penthouse.
Madoff: "It's all just one big lie."

---
