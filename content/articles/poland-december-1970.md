## Summary

On December 14, 1970, the workers of Poland's Baltic coast walked out of their shipyards and into history. They had just learned that the government was raising food prices by up to 30%—just before Christmas. Within hours, the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk was on strike, and workers were marching on Communist Party headquarters. Within days, the army was shooting them dead.[^1]

The December 1970 events, sometimes called the "Coast Massacre," were the bloodiest labor confrontation in postwar Polish history. At least 44 workers were killed, possibly more. The deadliest day came on December 17—"Black Thursday"—when soldiers opened fire on workers in Gdynia returning to their shipyard. Bodies lay in the streets. The government called it a response to "hooliganism." The workers called it murder.[^2]

The immediate result was a change of leadership: Władysław Gomułka, who had come to power promising liberalization in 1956, was replaced by Edward Gierek. The deeper result was the birth of a tradition. Ten years later, workers would strike again at the same Gdańsk shipyard, form Solidarity, and eventually bring down communist rule altogether. The martyrs of December 1970 are memorialized today at the very gates where they died.[^3]

**Władysław Gomułka:**
- Came to power during "Polish October" (1956)

- Effective immediately
- Meat: Up 17%
- Flour: Up 16%
- Other foods: Up 13-30%

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Economic:**
- Price increases hit workers hard
- Timing (Christmas) especially cruel
- Years of frustration

**Political:**
- Workers had no voice
- Unions were state-controlled
- Gomułka regime had lost legitimacy

### Why Was It So Bloody?

**Government panic:**
- Feared losing control
- Ordered military response
- Soldiers often confused, frightened
- Orders to fire unclear (or all too clear)

**Lack of alternatives:**
- No channels for negotiation
- No independent unions
- Only force remained

### Did It Matter?

**Immediately:**
- Leadership change (Gomułka → Gierek)
- Economic concessions
- But system unchanged

**Long-term:**
- Created martyrs
- Workers learned: They had power
- Solidarity would build on this
- December 1970 = founding trauma of Polish workers' movement[^11]

### In Polish Film
