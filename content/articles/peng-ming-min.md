## Summary

Peng Ming-min (1923-2022) was a pioneering Taiwanese democracy activist, legal scholar, and advocate for Taiwan independence who challenged the authoritarian Kuomintang regime during its most repressive era. As the youngest full professor at National Taiwan University at age 34, he co-authored the groundbreaking 1964 Declaration of Formosan Self-Salvation, which called for Taiwan's democratization and self-determination, leading to his arrest and conviction for sedition.[^1] After a dramatic escape to exile in 1970, he spent 22 years abroad advocating for Taiwan's freedom, co-founding the Formosan Association for Public Affairs, before returning to Taiwan in 1992 to become the Democratic Progressive Party's first presidential candidate.[^2] His life's work transformed him from a KMT-groomed rising star into the spiritual leader of Taiwan's independence movement, leaving an indelible mark on the island's path to democracy.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Peng Ming-min was born on August 15, 1923, in Dajia Township, Taichung County (then Taichū Prefecture), during the period of Japanese colonial rule over Taiwan.[^4] He came from a prominent and wealthy family of Taiwanese doctors, his father being Peng Ching-kao, a respected physician in central Taiwan.[^5] Growing up under Japanese administration, Peng received his primary education in Taiwan before traveling to Tokyo for secondary education, graduating in 1942.[^6]

The young Peng's life took a dramatic turn during World War II. While studying law and political science at the prestigious Imperial Tokyo University (later the University of Tokyo) from 1942 to 1945, he experienced firsthand the devastation of war.[^7] To avoid American bombing of Japan's capital, he decided to join his brother near Nagasaki. En route, he lost his left arm in an American bombing raid in 1945.[^8] While recuperating at his brother's house, he witnessed the second atomic blast that destroyed Nagasaki on August 9, 1945, an experience that would profoundly shape his worldview.[^9]

After Japan's surrender, Peng returned to Taiwan and enrolled at National Taiwan University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science in 1948.[^10] However, his return coincided with one of the darkest periods in Taiwan's modern history—the February 28 Incident of 1947, when Chinese Nationalist (KMT) forces brutally suppressed a local uprising, killing thousands of Taiwanese. Reflecting on this period, Peng later wrote: "During these terrifying weeks I remained quietly within my grandmother's house, frightened and worried... For all my hard work toward a degree in political science at the university, I was still far removed from practical politics and very naive. I had not yet fully realized how much more threatened our personal freedom was now than it had been under the Japanese."[^11]

His early observations of KMT governance were scathing. He described the Chinese Nationalists as "unbelievably corrupt and greedy. For eighteen months they looted our island.... They were carpetbaggers, occupying enemy territory, and we were being treated as a conquered people."[^12] Despite losing his left arm and witnessing extraordinary violence and upheaval, Peng was determined to pursue an academic career that would eventually lead him to challenge the very regime that had traumatized his homeland.

## Rise to Prominence

Following his undergraduate education at National Taiwan University, Peng Ming-min embarked on a distinguished academic career in international law that would bring him recognition both domestically and internationally. In 1953, he earned his LL.M. at the Institute of Air and Space Law at McGill University Faculty of Law in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, studying under the renowned scholar John Cobb Cooper.[^13] He then completed doctoral studies in France, earning his doctoral degree in law at the University of Paris in 1954.[^14]

During his studies abroad, Peng wrote some of the first essays on international air law published in France, Canada, and Japan. His publications attracted considerable international attention and distinguished him as a pioneer in the new field of international air law.[^15] This academic excellence would serve as his ticket to prominence within Taiwan's academic and political establishment.

Returning to Taiwan with impressive credentials, Peng joined the faculty at National Taiwan University. In 1957, at the remarkably young age of 34, he became the youngest full professor at the institution, a testament to his scholarly achievements.[^16] He served as professor and chairman of the Department of Political Science from 1961 to 1962, a position that brought him to the attention of Taiwan's ruling elite.[^17]

Peng's academic distinction attracted the notice of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek himself. In the early 1960s, Chiang appointed Peng as advisor to the Republic of China's delegation to the United Nations in New York—then the highest political position held by any native Taiwanese.[^18] The appointment was intended to showcase a successful Taiwanese academic who had been integrated into the KMT system, and Chiang hinted at future high-level governmental appointments for the rising star.[^19]

However, the UN experience had the opposite effect than what the KMT leadership intended. Peng later reflected: "My inner thoughts were in turmoil. The government and party bosses had made a great mistake in sending me to New York. This experience finally politicized me, and I was to lead a dual life thereafter, for many months, until I made a final commitment to challenge the dictatorship with a public demand for reform."[^20] The appointment caused Peng to lead what he called a "double life"—torn between his loyalty to Taiwan and his duties for the Republic of China, which claimed to be the sole legitimate government of both Taiwan and China.[^21]

This internal conflict would culminate in one of the most significant acts of political dissent in Taiwan's modern history, transforming the KMT's model scholar into the regime's most prominent critic.

## Major Achievements

### The 1964 Declaration of Formosan Self-Salvation

Peng Ming-min's most significant contribution to Taiwan's democracy movement came in 1964 when he, along with two of his students—Hsieh Tsung-min and Wei Ting-chao—secretly drafted the Declaration of Formosan Self-Salvation.[^22] This manifesto represented perhaps the first comprehensive challenge to the authoritarian KMT regime from within Taiwan itself.

The declaration boldly called Chiang Kai-shek's dream of "retaking China" unattainable and advocated for revolutionary changes: "one Taiwan, one China," a multiparty democracy, election of the president by popular vote, a new constitution, and protections for human rights and freedoms.[^23] The document argued for Taiwan's readmission to the UN Security Council as a nation independent of, and separate from, China.[^24] Most fundamentally, the manifesto proposed the concept of a Taiwanese nationhood, arguing that Taiwan's residents should cast aside ancestral distinctions between "local Taiwanese" and "mainlanders" and unite as one people to found a new nation.[^25]

Working in secret, the three men painstakingly printed 10,000 copies of the manifesto, planning to distribute them widely throughout Taiwan.[^26] However, before distribution could occur, they were arrested on September 20, 1964.[^27] The arrest of a prominent professor and his students sent shockwaves through Taiwan's intellectual community and drew international attention to the repressive nature of the KMT regime.

### International Advocacy and FAPA

After his dramatic escape from Taiwan in 1970, Peng dedicated himself to international advocacy for Taiwan's democracy and independence. In 1972, he published his English-language autobiography "A Taste of Freedom," which became a key resource for historians studying Taiwan's post-World War II political history, particularly the germination and early development of Taiwan's democracy and independence movements.[^28]

The book provided a firsthand account of life under authoritarian rule and became what many consider "arguably the most readable account of Taiwan's turbulent mid-twentieth century."[^29] In 1970, the New York Times published a summarized version of his manifesto, titled "Formosa for the Formosans," which emphasized that there is only one China and one Formosa (Taiwan), that retaking the mainland was an impossibility, and that Formosans must unite as one people to establish a new nation.[^30]

In 1982, Peng co-founded the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) in Los Angeles, California, a Taiwanese lobbying organization that would become one of the oldest grassroots advocacy organizations for Taiwan in the United States.[^31] The organization subsequently moved its headquarters to Washington, D.C., where it advocated for Taiwan's democratic reforms and international recognition.[^32] Peng served as FAPA's president from 1986 to 1988, during a critical period when Taiwan was transitioning away from martial law.[^33]

### Academic Career at University of Michigan

While in exile, Peng joined the faculty at the University of Michigan Law School in 1970, despite strenuous objections from both the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party.[^34] He remained at Michigan for 22 years, where he taught international law and continued his scholarly work.[^35] Having spent the majority of his career in international law abroad, Professor Peng believed that his lectures were able to convey an objective analysis of international legal matters regarding Taiwan.[^36]

### Return to Taiwan and Presidential Campaign

After President Lee Teng-hui promulgated a revision of Article 100 of the Criminal Code in 1992, which allowed Taiwanese to advocate independence without being charged with sedition and granted amnesty to political prisoners, Peng was finally able to return home.[^37] On November 2, 1992, he returned to Taiwan to a crowd of 1,000 people at Taoyuan International Airport, including leaders of the Democratic Progressive Party and many of his former students.[^38]

In 1995, the Democratic Progressive Party nominated Peng as their candidate for Taiwan's first direct presidential election, following an arduous two-tiered nomination process involving 49 public debates around Taiwan.[^39] He nominated legislator Frank Hsieh (Hsieh Chang-ting) as his running mate.[^40] Though the 72-year-old Peng ran outspokenly on a platform of Taiwanese independence, he garnered 21.13% of the votes, finishing second to incumbent President Lee Teng-hui, who won with 54%.[^41] Many independence supporters crossed over to vote for Lee, believing he could advance Taiwan's interests more pragmatically.[^42]

Despite the electoral loss, Peng's candidacy represented a historic milestone: the founder of Taiwan's independence movement competing openly for the presidency in a democratic election, something unimaginable just a few years earlier. After Chen Shui-bian's election as president in 2000, Peng served as a senior advisor, continuing to influence Taiwan's political development.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Anti-Mainland Rhetoric

While Peng Ming-min is celebrated as a democracy pioneer, his views and writings have also attracted criticism for what some scholars characterize as anti-Chinese rhetoric. His autobiography "A Taste of Freedom" is considered by some academics as "perhaps the first example of a consciously constructed anti-mainland rhetoric based on the contrast between civilized Taiwanese and uncivilized Chinese."[^44]

This criticism points to Peng's tendency to draw stark contrasts between Taiwanese identity and Chinese identity, which some argue contributed to ethnic tensions rather than the unity he claimed to seek. While his harsh criticism of KMT carpetbagger governance was grounded in observed corruption and violence, critics suggest that his rhetoric sometimes conflated the authoritarian regime with Chinese people more broadly, potentially alienating mainlanders who had fled to Taiwan and might otherwise have supported democratic reforms.

### Electoral Performance and Political Pragmatism

Peng's 1996 presidential campaign revealed tensions within the Taiwan independence movement. Despite being the DPP's standard-bearer and the spiritual leader of the independence movement, Peng received only 21% of the vote—significantly lower than the roughly one-third share the party normally received in elections.[^45] This underperformance occurred because many independence supporters crossed over to vote for President Lee Teng-hui, believing that Lee could more effectively advance Taiwan's interests while managing the delicate relationship with China.[^46]

The campaign also exposed debates about tactics and timing. Peng ran "outspokenly on a platform of Taiwanese independence," opposing trade with mainland China unless the PRC promised to "treat Taiwan as an equal," and rejecting unification with the mainland outright, describing the notion as "suicide" and "self-destruction."[^47] While this uncompromising stance appealed to true believers, it may have frightened moderate voters, especially during a period when the People's Liberation Army was conducting missile tests near Taiwan to intimidate the electorate.[^48]

Interestingly, despite their electoral competition, Peng lent Lee his support at a news conference in New York, feeling that Lee Teng-hui had to serve a second term to stabilize the political situation—a stance that earned him "ruthless attacks from the World United Formosans for Independence."[^49] This pragmatic decision illustrated the complexity of Peng's political thinking, even as it disappointed more radical independence activists who wanted a clearer alternative to Lee.

### Relationship with Lee Teng-hui

Peng's relationship with Lee Teng-hui was complicated and evolved significantly over the decades. Lee had a friendship with Peng during his earlier years, which led to Lee being placed on a KMT blacklist.[^50] However, when they met backstage at a political debate during the 1996 presidential election, they shook hands almost as if they were strangers, marking the first time they had met since Peng returned to Taiwan.[^51]

In a frank eulogy after Lee's death, Peng described Lee's predicament: "As a Taiwanese, he wanted to safeguard and enhance Taiwanese's political rights and push for democratization. As KMT chairman, he had to sacrifice certain basic human rights for the sake of unification. He was constantly struggling with this dilemma."[^52] This assessment reveals Peng's ambivalence toward Lee—recognizing his contributions to democratization while critiquing his compromises with the KMT establishment.

### The Price of Exile

While Peng's escape to exile allowed him to continue advocating for Taiwan internationally, it also meant abandoning his family in Taiwan for 22 years. His wife, Li Chun, whom he married in 1949, remained in Taiwan when he escaped to Sweden in 1970.[^53] The personal cost of his political commitment was substantial, though he rarely discussed these sacrifices publicly, and little information about his family life has been revealed.

---

## Personal Life

Peng Ming-min married Li Chun in 1949, shortly after completing his undergraduate degree at National Taiwan University.[^54] However, very little of his family life has been revealed publicly, as Peng maintained a focus on his political and academic work rather than personal matters. Available sources do not provide specific information about whether Peng and Li Chun had children or other details about their family life.[^55]

The most significant personal challenge Peng faced was the loss of his left arm during a U.S. bombing raid on Japan in 1945 while he was a student.[^56] This disability never prevented him from achieving academic excellence or engaging in dangerous political activism. The injury became part of his identity, a visible reminder of the war's devastation that may have contributed to his commitment to creating a more peaceful and democratic society.

Peng's personality, as revealed through his memoir and the accounts of those who knew him, combined scholarly rigor with moral courage. He was described as a "consummate intellectual" who approached political problems with the same analytical framework he applied to international law.[^57] His decision to challenge the KMT dictatorship despite having everything to lose—a prestigious academic position, the favor of Chiang Kai-shek, and a comfortable life—speaks to a deep sense of moral obligation.

After his escape in 1970, Peng reflected: "In my whole life I had never felt such a sense of real freedom. After fourteen months in prison and over four years under surveillance I still could not believe that I had finally managed to escape from captivity."[^58] This statement reveals both the psychological toll of house arrest and Peng's profound appreciation for freedom—the "taste of freedom" that became the title of his memoir.

His 22 years in exile were marked by tireless advocacy work, yet he never lost sight of his ultimate goal: returning to a free and democratic Taiwan. When he finally returned in 1992, at age 69, he threw himself into domestic politics despite having spent more than two decades abroad. This commitment continued until his death at age 98, demonstrating a lifelong dedication to Taiwan's democratic future.

In his personal philosophy, Peng firmly believed that the most pressing task for Taiwan was to cast aside distinctions between "local Taiwanese" and "mainlanders," and unite as one people to found a new nation with a new constitution that could rejoin the UN as an independent country.[^59] This vision of an inclusive Taiwanese identity, transcending ethnic divisions imposed by history, remained his guiding principle throughout his life.

## Legacy

Peng Ming-min passed away on April 8, 2022, at age 98 at the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center in Taipei.[^60] Following his wishes, he did not have a funeral but was cremated and buried at the Presbyterian Church cemetery in Yancheng District, Kaohsiung.[^61] His death marked the end of an era in Taiwan's democracy movement, prompting an outpouring of tributes from across Taiwan's political spectrum.

### Enduring Impact on Taiwan's Democracy

Peng's legacy is multifaceted and profound. Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Mark Ho Chih-wei stated that Peng's impact on Taiwan "is not measured in 100 or 200 years, but will last forever."[^62] DPP Legislator Chen Ting-fei called Peng's life "a history book on Taiwan's democracy," describing him as "a spiritual leader of Taiwan's independence movement."[^63]

The 1964 Declaration of Formosan Self-Salvation remains Peng's most enduring contribution. As observers have noted, "Perhaps the greatest influence Peng had on Taiwan was his 1964 manifesto A Declaration of Formosan Self-salvation, in which he proposed the concept of a Taiwanese nationhood."[^64] This document articulated ideas that were revolutionary in 1964 but became mainstream in Taiwan's democratic discourse: popular sovereignty, constitutional reform, self-determination, and the vision of Taiwan as a distinct political entity separate from China.

Peng's memoir "A Taste of Freedom" has become essential reading for understanding Taiwan's transformation from authoritarian rule to democracy. The book provides not just historical documentation but also inspiration for activists facing oppression. Throughout his life, Peng "engaged in a ceaseless struggle for democracy and human rights for Taiwanese," setting an example of moral courage under extreme pressure.[^65]

### Transitional Justice and Historical Vindication

In early 2025, nearly three years after his death, Taiwan's Ministry of Justice revoked Peng's 1964 sedition conviction, stating that his prosecution violated the principles of free and democratic constitutional order and the right to a fair trial.[^66] The Peng Ming-min Foundation had applied for this reversal in 2023, and the justice ministry's decision revokes all criminal penalties associated with the 1964 case, recognizing them as a judicial injustice.[^67]

A board member of the Peng Ming-min Foundation called the revocation "not only justice delayed but also a significant step in Taiwan's journey toward transitional justice."[^68] This legal vindication confirms what Peng's supporters had argued for six decades: that his prosecution was politically motivated persecution of legitimate democratic advocacy, not legitimate enforcement of law.

### International Recognition

Peng's dramatic escape in 1970 "caught the attention of the international community and left officials within the then-KMT government severely shaken."[^69] His work with FAPA helped keep Taiwan's democratic aspirations visible in Washington, D.C., and other international capitals during the darkest years of martial law. FAPA President Minze Chien stated: "Dr. Peng makes all of us at FAPA proud to be a member of this illustrious organization" and noted that "Professor Peng lives on – very much so in all of us who have had the honor and the pleasure to walk with him."[^70]

### Influence on Subsequent Generations

Peng's courage inspired generations of democracy activists in Taiwan. As one assessment noted, "Peng Ming-min, Wei Ting-chao, and Roger Hsieh became the democracy pioneers of that era, making many students begin to care about social issues in Taiwan and arousing the yearning of many descendants for a democratic and free society."[^71] His willingness to sacrifice his career, freedom, and years with his family for democratic principles provided a powerful example that emboldened others to challenge authoritarianism.

### Commemorations

In August 2025, an exhibition about Peng Ming-min opened in Taiwan, celebrating his life and contributions to democracy.[^72] President Tsai Ing-wen paid tribute to him on what would have been his 100th birthday in 2022, recognizing his foundational role in Taiwan's democratic transformation.[^73] These commemorations ensure that Peng's story remains part of Taiwan's collective memory, reminding new generations of the struggles that secured their freedoms.

Peng's journey—from KMT-groomed rising star to leader of Taiwan's self-determination movement—embodies Taiwan's own transformation from authoritarian rule to vibrant democracy. His life's work laid the intellectual and moral foundations for Taiwan's current status as a free, democratic society, even as debates continue about the island's ultimate political future.

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and democracy advocates consistently celebrate Peng Ming-min as one of the most important figures in Taiwan's democratization. He is remembered as "a consummate intellectual and a towering figure in Taiwan's resistance movement against the authoritarian KMT regime."[^74] His contributions extend beyond symbolic resistance to substantive intellectual work that provided the theoretical framework for Taiwan's democracy movement.

Academic assessments emphasize that Peng's 1964 manifesto was decades ahead of its time. The ideas considered seditious in 1964—popular sovereignty, self-determination, constitutional reform, and Taiwan's separate identity from China—became the mainstream political consensus in democratic Taiwan. This transformation vindicated Peng's vision and demonstrated his prescient understanding of Taiwan's political trajectory.

International observers have praised Peng's moral courage. Writing about his escape, one commentator noted that "The fact that I risked my life to flee Formosa is itself a complete repudiation of the regime and all their propaganda aimed at discrediting me."[^75] His willingness to sacrifice everything for democratic principles, when he could have lived comfortably as a favored academic, distinguishes him as a figure of extraordinary integrity.

Democracy advocates credit Peng with keeping the flame of Taiwan independence alive during the darkest years of martial law. His advocacy work in the United States through FAPA provided international visibility to Taiwan's democratic aspirations when domestic dissent was violently suppressed. As Taiwan transitioned to democracy, Peng's earlier sacrifices gained new significance as the pioneering efforts that made later progress possible.

The Taipei Times editorial board wrote: "Throughout his life Peng engaged in a ceaseless struggle for democracy and human rights for Taiwanese."[^76] This assessment captures the consistency of Peng's commitment across six decades, from his 1964 manifesto through his service as a presidential advisor in the 2000s, maintaining his principles while adapting his tactics to changing circumstances.

### Negative Views

Critics of Peng Ming-min, while generally acknowledging his contributions to democracy, have raised several concerns about his approach and legacy. The most significant criticism involves his rhetoric about Chinese identity and mainlanders in Taiwan.

Academic analysis suggests that Peng's autobiography represents "perhaps the first example of a consciously constructed anti-mainland rhetoric based on the contrast between civilized Taiwanese and uncivilized Chinese."[^77] This criticism argues that while Peng advocated for unity among Taiwan's residents, his framing sometimes reinforced ethnic divisions rather than transcending them. By emphasizing the contrast between Taiwanese and Chinese, critics suggest, Peng may have made it harder to build the broad coalition necessary for democratic change.

Some observers within the Taiwan independence movement criticized Peng for excessive pragmatism, particularly his support for Lee Teng-hui in 1996 despite running against him. Radical independence activists wanted a clearer alternative to Lee's more cautious approach, and Peng's willingness to support his opponent "earned him ruthless attacks from the World United Formosans for Independence."[^78] These critics saw Peng's pragmatism as a betrayal of the uncompromising principles he had articulated in 1964.

From a different perspective, some pragmatists criticized Peng's uncompromising stance on independence during his 1996 presidential campaign. His description of unification as "suicide" and "self-destruction," while emotionally resonant for independence supporters, may have frightened moderate voters and made it harder for the DPP to build a majority coalition.[^79] This tension between principle and electoral viability has characterized debates within Taiwan's independence movement for decades.

Critics also note that Peng's 22 years in exile, while enabling international advocacy, meant he was disconnected from the day-to-day struggles of democracy activists in Taiwan during the critical 1970s and 1980s. When he returned in 1992, Taiwan had changed dramatically, and some questioned whether he fully understood the complex political dynamics that had emerged during his absence. His relatively poor showing in the 1996 presidential election (21% versus the DPP's usual one-third share) suggested that many Taiwanese respected his historical contributions but questioned his contemporary political judgment.[^80]

Finally, some historians note that Peng's focus on Taiwan independence sometimes overshadowed other important aspects of democratic reform, such as economic justice, environmental protection, and indigenous rights. While his contributions to constitutional reform and self-determination were crucial, critics suggest that a more comprehensive vision of democratic transformation might have addressed these additional dimensions of social justice.

Despite these criticisms, even Peng's critics generally acknowledge his courage, integrity, and pivotal role in Taiwan's democratization. The debates about his legacy reflect broader tensions within Taiwan's democracy movement about identity, strategy, and priorities—tensions that Peng himself navigated throughout his long and consequential life.
