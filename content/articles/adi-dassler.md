## Summary

Adi Dassler founded Adidas, one of the world's largest sportswear companies. He and his brother Rudolf started making shoes together before a bitter family feud split them apart — Rudolf went on to found Puma. Adi's obsession with improving athletic footwear led to innovations that helped Jesse Owens win gold at the 1936 Olympics. The three-stripe Adidas logo became one of the most recognized brand symbols in sports.
