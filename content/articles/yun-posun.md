## Summary

Yun Posun (born August 26, 1897; died July 18, 1990) was a South Korean politician and independence activist who served as the 2nd President of South Korea from 1960 to 1962.[^1] His presidency corresponded with the **Second Republic**, the only parliamentary democratic government in South Korean history, which was established following the April 19 Revolution that toppled Syngman Rhee.[^2] Although his time in office was brief and largely ceremonial due to the parliamentary system, Yun remains a significant figure for his lifelong dedication to democracy and his fierce opposition to the subsequent military dictatorship of Park Chung-hee.[^3]

## Early Life and Independence Movement

Yun Posun was born in 1897 in Asan, South Chungcheong Province, into a prominent noble family (the Haepyeong Yun clan). His uncle was the famous independence activist Yun Chi-ho.[^4]

Yun studied abroad in the United Kingdom, earning a Master of Arts from the **University of Edinburgh** in 1930. His time in Scotland deeply influenced his political philosophy, instilling in him a respect for British-style parliamentary democracy and civil liberties.[^5] Upon returning to Korea under Japanese rule, he refused to collaborate with the colonial government and quietly supported the independence movement.

## Political Career

### Entry into Politics
After liberation in 1945, Yun entered politics as a protege of Syngman Rhee. He served as the **Mayor of Seoul** (1948–1949) and the Minister of Commerce and Industry (1949–1950).[^6] However, he grew increasingly disillusioned with Rhee's authoritarianism. In 1954, he was elected to the National Assembly and became a founding member of the opposition **Democratic Party**, positioning himself as a leading critic of Rhee's "dictatorial" Liberal Party.[^7]

### The Second Republic (1960–1961)
The **April 19 Revolution** of 1960 forced Syngman Rhee to resign. The constitution was amended to switch from a presidential system to a parliamentary cabinet system to prevent future dictatorships.
*   **Presidency:** In August 1960, the National Assembly elected Yun Posun as the President of the Republic. Under the new system, the President was the ceremonial head of state, while executive power lay with Prime Minister **Chang Myon**.[^8]
*   **Turmoil:** The Second Republic was plagued by factional infighting within the ruling Democratic Party (between Yun's "Old Faction" and Chang's "New Faction") and constant street protests by students demanding faster reforms. Yun often clashed with Prime Minister Chang, weakening the government's stability.[^9]

### The 5.16 Coup
On May 16, 1961, Major General **Park Chung-hee** staged a military coup. The democratic government of the Second Republic collapsed. Yun Posun initially remained in office to provide continuity and prevent a counter-coup that could lead to civil war, a decision for which he was later criticized. He eventually resigned on March 22, 1962, in protest of the military's purge of politicians.[^10]

## Struggle Against Dictatorship

After resigning, Yun did not retire. He became the face of the unparalleled opposition against Park Chung-hee.
*   **Presidential Bids:** He ran against Park in the 1963 and 1967 presidential elections. He famously attacked Park's communist past (in the South Korean Workers' Party), aiming to discredit the military leader.[^11] He lost both elections but solidified his status as the leader of the democratic opposition.
*   **Persecution:** Throughout the 1970s, Yun was repeatedly harassed, arrested, and given suspended prison sentences for organizing protests against the Yushin Constitution. He became a "spiritual godfather" to the younger generation of activists, including Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung.[^12]

## Legacy

Yun Posun died on July 18, 1990, at the age of 92.

**Historical Assessment:**
*   **Democratic Symbol:** He is respected for his integrity and his unyielding fight against authoritarianism spanning three decades.[^13]
*   **Ineffective Leader:** Historians often criticize his presidency for its factionalism. His rivalry with Chang Myon paralyzed the Second Republic, arguably creating the vacuum that allowed the military to seize power.[^14]
*   **Aristocratic Politician:** Unlike the populists of later eras, Yun represented the old-school, gentry-style liberalism, which sometimes made him appear detached from the common people's economic struggles.[^15]
