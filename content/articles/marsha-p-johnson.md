## Summary

Marsha P. Johnson (August 24, 1945 – July 6, 1992) was an African American transgender activist, drag performer, and pioneering figure in the LGBTQ rights movement.[^1] Known as the "Saint of Christopher Street," she was a key participant in the 1969 Stonewall uprising and co-founded Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) with Sylvia Rivera, one of the first organizations dedicated to transgender rights in the United States.[^2] Throughout her life, Johnson fought tirelessly for the rights of the most marginalized members of the LGBTQ community, particularly transgender youth and people of color, while also becoming a prominent AIDS activist in the 1980s.[^3] Her death in 1992 remains controversial, with many believing she was murdered despite an initial police ruling of suicide.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Marsha P. Johnson was born Malcolm Michaels Jr. on August 24, 1945, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to Alberta Claiborne, a housekeeper, and Malcolm Michaels Sr., who worked on the General Motors assembly line in neighboring Linden, New Jersey.[^5] She was the fifth of seven children in a working-class Black family deeply rooted in Christian faith.[^6] Her father had relocated from Virginia during the Second Great Migration, seeking better economic opportunities in the industrial North.[^7] The family lived in a small house on Washington Avenue in central Elizabeth, a city that was both segregated and an emerging hub for civil rights activism during Johnson's youth.[^8]

From an early age, Johnson exhibited gender non-conforming behavior. At age five, she wore women's clothing for the first time, an expression of her authentic self that brought her joy but also attracted harassment and violence.[^9] After being sexually assaulted by a 13-year-old boy, young Malcolm felt pressured to stop wearing the clothes that reflected her true identity.[^10] Despite the challenges, Johnson remained connected to her faith, attending Mount Teman African Methodist Episcopal Church throughout her childhood and maintaining her Christian practice for the rest of her life.[^11]

Johnson's parents separated when she was only three years old, with her father returning to Linden to work at the GM plant.[^12] While Johnson lived with her mother in Elizabeth, her father maintained an active presence in her life.[^13] Her relationship with her mother was complicated—Alberta struggled to understand aspects of Johnson's LGBTQ identity but was generally supportive, helping her find legal representation after her first arrest and regularly visiting her during psychiatric hospitalizations.[^14] Elizabeth in the 1950s and 1960s was a city of contrasts, where activists launched campaigns to protest discrimination at local establishments like Howard Johnson's hotel, providing young Marsha with early exposure to civil rights activism.[^15]

After graduating from Thomas A. Edison High School, Johnson made the momentous decision to leave home immediately, moving to New York City with only one bag of clothes and fifteen dollars.[^16] This courageous leap would mark the beginning of her transformation into one of the most important activists in LGBTQ history.

## Rise to Prominence

Upon arriving in New York City in 1963, Johnson gravitated to Greenwich Village, particularly Christopher Street, which served as the epicenter of New York's LGBTQ community in the 1960s.[^17] She returned to dressing in women's clothing and adopted the name Marsha P. Johnson—the "P" stood for "Pay It No Mind," which became her signature phrase and life philosophy.[^18] Johnson described herself as a gay person, a transvestite, and a drag queen, using she/her pronouns; the term "transgender" only became commonly used after her death.[^19] In later interviews, when asked whether she saw herself as a man or woman, Johnson replied, "I think of myself as me."[^20]

Life in New York was difficult for the young Johnson. Unable to find conventional employment, she turned to sex work to survive, an experience that exposed her to frequent abuse from clients and harassment from police.[^21] She lacked stable housing and spent nights bouncing between friends' apartments, hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, and gay bathhouses.[^22] Despite these hardships, Johnson found her community and her voice. She began working at Childs Restaurant in Times Square, where she met Sylvia Rivera, another young transgender person who would become her lifelong friend and collaborator.[^23] Johnson took Rivera out to eat with money she had earned from begging, the beginning of a friendship Rivera later described by saying Johnson "was like a mother to me."[^24]

In the vibrant nightlife of Christopher Street, Johnson blossomed as a drag queen and performer. She designed all of her own elaborate costumes, mostly from thrift shops, creating distinctive looks that made her a beloved figure in the community.[^25] Her performances were characterized by creativity, joy, and political defiance. Johnson later said, "I was no one, nobody, from Nowheresville until I became a drag queen."[^26]

The pivotal moment that thrust Johnson into the forefront of the gay liberation movement came on June 28, 1969, when police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village, and began arresting patrons.[^27] Johnson's exact role in the Stonewall uprising remains a subject of debate. She herself stated that she didn't arrive at the scene until "two o'clock" after the chaos had begun, contradicting later narratives that credited her with throwing the first brick.[^28] Scholars Florence Ashley and Sam Sanchinel note that while Johnson was likely not one of the primary instigators, there is no doubt she was present on the front lines of the resistance.[^29] Johnson periodically became confused and frustrated when asked too many questions about Stonewall, which scholars speculate may have been the result of trauma.[^30]

Following the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the newly formed Gay Liberation Front (GLF), a radical organization advocating for LGBTQ rights.[^31] She also participated in the first Christopher Street Liberation Day parade on June 28, 1970, marking the one-year anniversary of Stonewall.[^32] However, Johnson grew increasingly frustrated by the exclusion of transgender people and LGBTQ people of color from the mainstream gay rights movement.[^33]

## Major Achievements

Marsha P. Johnson's most significant and enduring contribution to the LGBTQ rights movement was the co-founding of Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) with Sylvia Rivera in 1970.[^34] STAR was one of the first transgender rights organizations in the United States and represented a revolutionary approach to activism that centered the most marginalized members of the LGBTQ community.[^35] The idea for STAR emerged during the Weinstein Hall occupation in September 1970, when Johnson suggested forming an organization specifically for transgender people.[^36]

STAR's mission was radical and comprehensive. The organization advocated for bodily autonomy and demanded free clothing, education, food, healthcare, housing, and transportation for transgender people.[^37] It also condemned transphobic abuse and discrimination both within and outside of the LGBTQ community.[^38] STAR was explicitly revolutionary in its politics, challenging not just heterosexual norms but also the assimilationist tendencies of mainstream gay rights organizations that sought respectability through excluding the most visible and marginalized queer people.[^39]

The most ambitious project undertaken by STAR was STAR House, established in the East Village, Manhattan, in November 1970.[^40] STAR House provided food and shelter for transgender youth, particularly those who had been shunned by their families and were living on the streets.[^41] Rivera explained in 1998: "Marsha and I decided it was time to help each other and help our other kids. We went out and hustled the streets. We paid the rent."[^42] Johnson and Rivera supported STAR House through sex work, demonstrating their commitment to mutual aid and community care.[^43] The house operated until July 1971, providing sanctuary for vulnerable young people during a time when few other resources existed for transgender youth.[^44]

Johnson's activism extended beyond STAR into the broader cultural landscape of New York. From 1972 through 1990, she performed with Hot Peaches, a gay political theater company that specialized in what has been described as "political camp, dominated by drag."[^45] Johnson appeared in four productions between 1972 and 1973, including "Sabled Sables," "Androgyny in Ostendorf," a revival of "The Wonderful Wizard of U.S," and "Alice and the Great American Sideshow."[^46] She continued performing with Hot Peaches for nearly two decades, taking to the stage sporting red heels and bright wings.[^47] Hot Peaches provided not just a performance platform but a nurturing queer community that valued self-expression and political engagement.[^48]

In 1975, Johnson served as a model for Andy Warhol's "Ladies and Gentlemen" series, for which she was paid fifty dollars.[^49] The relationship between Johnson and Warhol has been contested by art historians, though Johnson described them as friends.[^50] The irony of this arrangement was not lost on observers—a 1979 Village Voice interview highlighted Johnson walking past a gallery displaying her portrait for sale at many thousands of dollars while she struggled to afford housing.[^51] This exploitation exemplified broader patterns of how marginalized artists and activists have historically been commodified without receiving fair compensation or recognition.[^52]

When the AIDS epidemic devastated New York's LGBTQ community beginning in the 1980s, Johnson once again stepped forward to serve those most in need.[^53] She joined ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), participating in protests and raising awareness about the impact of AIDS on marginalized communities.[^54] Johnson cared for friends dying of AIDS and provided both practical and emotional support during the darkest years of the crisis.[^55] In 1990, she tested positive for HIV herself.[^56] That same year, she experienced a personal crisis marked by the AIDS-related deaths of friends and fellow performers.[^57] In a powerful demonstration of her ongoing activism, Johnson performed with Hot Peaches in London in 1990, singing "Love" while wearing an ACT UP "Silence = Death" button, merging her performance art with AIDS advocacy.[^58]

Throughout her activism, Johnson was known for her radical generosity. Activist Randy Wicker later recalled her as "the most generous person [he] ever knew," noting that she gave people clothes and food even though she had very little herself.[^59] This ethic of mutual aid and community care defined Johnson's approach to activism—she believed in direct action to meet immediate needs while also fighting for systemic change.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Marsha P. Johnson's life and legacy have been the subject of various controversies, many of which reveal broader tensions within LGBTQ history and activism. The most persistent debate concerns the application of modern terminology to Johnson's identity. Johnson described herself as a gay person, a transvestite, and a drag queen, using she/her pronouns, but never used the term "transgender," which only became commonly used after her death.[^61] Today, many historians and activists describe Johnson as a trans woman, while others argue this represents an anachronistic imposition of contemporary categories onto a historical figure.[^62]

Filmmaker Tourmaline, who directed a documentary about Johnson, ultimately considers it a "fool's errand" to try to determine "whether an individual in 1969 was a gay man, versus a drag queen, versus a transvestite, versus a trans woman."[^63] Tourmaline and other scholars speculate that Johnson may have identified with the term "gender fluid" if it had been commonly used during her lifetime.[^64] This debate reflects broader challenges in LGBTQ history about respecting how historical figures identified themselves while also recognizing their significance to contemporary movements.[^65]

Johnson's role in the Stonewall uprising has also been subject to mythologization and correction. Popular narratives have sometimes credited Johnson with throwing the first brick of the uprising, but Johnson herself stated she arrived at the scene around 2 a.m., after the riot had already begun.[^66] Scholars Florence Ashley and Sam Sanchinel argue that while Johnson was likely not one of the primary instigators, she was clearly present on the front lines and played an important role in the resistance.[^67] They suggest that transgender communities claim Johnson's presence at Stonewall as a way of asserting their place within the broader LGBTQ coalition, even as the precise details of her involvement remain unclear.[^68]

Some scholars have criticized how the mainstream transgender movement uses Johnson's history opportunistically, celebrating her activism while overlooking her class position, race, mental health struggles, and work as a sex worker when these aspects are inconvenient to more respectable narratives.[^69] This selective memory erases crucial aspects of Johnson's identity and the structural conditions that shaped her life and activism.[^70] There is an ever-present risk, scholars warn, of Johnson's life and labor being decontextualized and exploited, particularly by predominantly white mainstream LGBTQ organizations.[^71]

Johnson experienced complex mental health challenges throughout her life, including complex post-traumatic stress disorder, neurodiversity, sadness, and suicidality.[^72] In the 1970s, she experienced a series of mental health breakdowns and spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals.[^73] Those who knew her described her as volatile and unpredictable.[^74] Johnson's institutionalization and treatment with Thorazine demonstrate how the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders medicalized both gender variance and mental illness, an intersection scholars have termed "neurotrans."[^75]

Scholar Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha argues that Johnson's mental health struggles were both sources of suffering and gifts that allowed her to exhibit radical kindness and openness and to reject respectability politics.[^76] This interpretation challenges ableist narratives that treat mental illness only as deficit, recognizing instead how Johnson's experiences shaped her revolutionary approach to activism and community care.[^77]

The 2017 documentary "The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson" generated its own controversy. Mariah Lopez, Johnson's niece and Sylvia Rivera's daughter, released a statement criticizing both filmmaker Tourmaline and director David France, stating that Tourmaline had worked to silence Lopez's Strategic Trans Alliance for Radical Reform (STARR).[^78] Lopez accused France of "predatory, manipulative journalistic tactics" and "jeopardizing her safety and well-being."[^79] These accusations highlight ongoing tensions about who has the authority to tell Johnson's story and how her legacy should be stewarded.[^80]

## Personal Life

Marsha P. Johnson's personal life was characterized by resilience, creativity, generosity, and community connection despite facing significant hardships. After moving to New York City, Johnson struggled to maintain stable housing throughout most of her life.[^81] She regularly slept in friends' apartments, hotels, adult movie theaters, and gay bathhouses, embodying the precarity faced by many transgender people, particularly those engaged in sex work.[^82] From 1979 to 1980, Johnson was unhoused, but beginning in 1980 she lived with activist Randy Wicker in Hoboken, New Jersey.[^83]

Johnson's friendship with Sylvia Rivera was the defining relationship of her life. The two met in 1963 at Childs Restaurant in Times Square, when Johnson took the younger Rivera out to eat.[^84] Rivera described Johnson as "like a mother to me," and the two became inseparable fixtures of the Christopher Street gay community.[^85] Rivera's fiery demeanor and simpler aesthetic contrasted with Johnson's more elaborate, joyful presentation, but together they formed a powerful partnership.[^86] Their friendship faded in the mid-1970s when Rivera moved to Tarrytown, New York, and Johnson remained in New York City, though they remained connected.[^87] After Johnson's death, Rivera founded Transy House in Park Slope, Brooklyn in 1997 to honor Johnson's memory, and in 2001 she resurrected STAR as an active political organization.[^88]

Johnson also developed an artistic collaboration with Agosto Machado, with whom she regularly worked on creative ventures.[^89] These relationships reflected Johnson's ability to build community and find joy and meaning through artistic expression and political solidarity.[^90]

Johnson's relationship with her birth family remained complex throughout her life. While her mother Alberta struggled to fully understand Johnson's identity, she provided crucial support at key moments, including helping Johnson find legal representation after her first arrest and visiting her during psychiatric hospitalizations.[^91] This complicated family dynamic was typical of many LGBTQ people of Johnson's generation, who often had to navigate partial acceptance rather than full embrace.[^92]

Those who knew Johnson remembered her as remarkably generous despite her poverty. She had a reputation for giving people clothes and food even when she had very little herself.[^93] Activist Randy Wicker recalled her as "the most generous person [he] ever knew."[^94] This radical generosity was not just a personality trait but a political practice, embodying the mutual aid principles that informed Johnson's activism.[^95]

Johnson's personality was described as vibrant, unpredictable, and joyful. Her famous motto—"Pay It No Mind"—reflected a philosophy of resilience and defiance in the face of discrimination and violence.[^96] She famously said, "I may be crazy, but that don't make me wrong," asserting her right to exist on her own terms.[^97] Her performances and public presence were characterized by elaborate costumes she designed herself, typically incorporating bright colors, flowers, and found objects from thrift stores.[^98]

## Legacy

Marsha P. Johnson's legacy extends far beyond her lifetime, continuing to inspire LGBTQ activism and particularly transgender rights movements around the world. Though she did not receive much recognition during her lifetime, Johnson's story gained significant attention during the early 2000s, and she is now remembered as a key figure in the LGBTQ civil rights movement.[^99] Her participation in the Stonewall uprising, advocacy for transgender people through STAR, and AIDS activism have secured her an important place in movement history.[^100]

Scholars increasingly recognize that Johnson's most significant contributions extended beyond single dramatic moments like Stonewall to encompass sustained mutual aid and community support work.[^101] As researchers Florence Ashley and Sam Sanchinel argue, "trans communities are seeking to narrate Marsha P. Johnson in a context that transcends Stonewall's momentousness by accentuating the radicality of her loving, everyday self."[^102] This reframing emphasizes Johnson's revolutionary practice of care, particularly her work sheltering homeless transgender youth through STAR House.[^103]

The Marsha P. Johnson Institute, founded to continue her work, advocates for the rights of Black transgender people and carries forward her commitment to centering the most marginalized members of the LGBTQ community.[^104] The organization's existence demonstrates how Johnson's political vision continues to inform contemporary activism, particularly around the intersection of race, gender identity, and economic justice.[^105]

Johnson has been honored with numerous monuments and tributes. On August 24, 2020, the 75th anniversary of her birth, East River State Park in Brooklyn was renamed Marsha P. Johnson State Park, becoming the first New York state park named after an openly LGBTQ person.[^106] In May 2019, New York City announced that Johnson and Sylvia Rivera would be honored with a monument in Greenwich Village near the Stonewall site, which would be the "first permanent, public artwork recognizing transgender women in the world."[^107] However, this project faced significant delays due to bureaucratic processes and the COVID-19 pandemic.[^108]

In an act of guerrilla activism echoing Johnson's own approach, transgender activists installed their own unauthorized sculpture, "A Love Letter to Marsha," in Christopher Park on August 24, 2021.[^109] Created by artist Jesse Pallotta, the sculpture was notably the first statue of a transgender individual in New York City.[^110] It was given a temporary permit and displayed until August 24, 2022, before being moved to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center.[^111]

In Johnson's hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey, officials announced that a statue would be erected near City Hall on the Freedom Trail, anticipated to be the first public monument in New Jersey to honor an LGBTQ person and transgender woman of color.[^112] This announcement came after 166,000 people signed a petition to have Johnson honored posthumously in her hometown.[^113]

In June 2019, Johnson was one of the inaugural fifty American "pioneers, trailblazers, and heroes" inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor at the Stonewall National Monument.[^114] A large painted mural depicting Johnson and Rivera went on display in Dallas, Texas, in August 2019 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, becoming the largest mural honoring the transgender community in the United States.[^115]

Johnson has also become a subject of significant artistic and scholarly attention. She is featured in several films, including the documentaries "Pay It No Mind" and "The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson," as well as the short film "Happy Birthday, Marsha!"[^116] These cultural productions have introduced Johnson's story to new generations and sparked important conversations about transgender history and activism.[^117]

Johnson's relentless activism and resistance paved the way for greater visibility and acceptance of transgender and queer individuals.[^118] Her life and activism continue to serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration for those fighting for equality, representation, and justice, particularly at a time when LGBTQ rights, especially transgender rights, face renewed attacks.[^119] As the Marsha P. Johnson Institute notes, her true legacy is "BLACK trans joy and never-ending resistance."[^120]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and activists have increasingly recognized Marsha P. Johnson as a foundational figure in LGBTQ and transgender rights movements. The National Women's History Museum describes her as "one of the most prominent figures of the gay rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s in New York City," acknowledging her outsized impact despite limited resources and systemic marginalization.[^121] Academic research has explored Johnson's life through multiple frameworks, revealing the complexity and significance of her contributions.[^122]

Scholars working in mad and disability studies have offered particularly rich interpretations of Johnson's legacy. Leah Lakshmi Piepzna-Samarasinha argues that Johnson's neurodiversity and mental health struggles were not simply deficits but sources of strength that enabled her to exhibit radical kindness, openness, and rejection of respectability politics.[^123] This perspective challenges ableist narratives and recognizes how Johnson's experiences shaped her revolutionary approach to activism and community care.[^124]

Researchers Florence Ashley and Sam Sanchinel have contributed important scholarship on what they call "the social life of a heroine," examining how transgender communities construct and deploy narratives about Johnson.[^125] They argue that community attachment to Johnson's memory serves to reclaim the place of trans people in LGBTQ history, asserting their presence and contributions against narratives that have often erased or minimized them.[^126] The scholars note that contemporary trans activism increasingly emphasizes Johnson's sustained mutual aid work rather than focusing exclusively on dramatic moments like Stonewall.[^127]

Some academics have even explored Johnson's legacy through unexpected frameworks. Medieval studies scholars have examined teaching about Johnson and Sylvia Rivera as medievalists, using the "medievalisms of resistance" exhibited by the two activists to re-center people of color in a field often dominated by white-supremacist appropriations of the medieval period.[^128] This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the breadth of Johnson's cultural significance and her capacity to inspire critical thinking across academic fields.[^129]

Activists and community organizers consistently cite Johnson as a model for intersectional activism that centers the most marginalized. Her commitment to supporting homeless transgender youth, sex workers, people living with HIV/AIDS, and LGBTQ people of color provides a template for movements that refuse to leave anyone behind.[^130] The principle that "you never completely have your rights, one person, until you all have your rights"—one of Johnson's most famous statements—continues to guide contemporary organizing.[^131]

### Negative Views

Critics and scholars have raised important concerns about how Johnson's legacy has been constructed, appropriated, and sometimes exploited. A central criticism is that mainstream LGBTQ movements, particularly predominantly white organizations, celebrate Johnson's activism while strategically overlooking aspects of her identity that challenge respectability politics.[^132] As some scholars argue, the mainstream transgender movement uses Johnson's history at Stonewall opportunistically, downplaying or erasing her class position, race, mental health struggles, and work as a sex worker when these facts are inconvenient.[^133]

This selective memory reflects broader patterns in LGBTQ movement politics, where radical figures are sanitized and commodified to serve assimilationist agendas that would have been antithetical to their actual politics.[^134] Scholars warn of the ever-present risk of STAR and trans women of color's lives and labor being decontextualized and exploited, particularly as Johnson's image appears on merchandise and in corporate Pride celebrations that do little to address the material conditions facing transgender people today.[^135]

Some historians have questioned the accuracy of popular narratives about Johnson's role at Stonewall, noting the gap between her own accounts (stating she arrived after the uprising had begun) and later narratives that positioned her as throwing the first brick.[^136] While scholars like Ashley and Sanchinel argue this mythologization serves important symbolic purposes for transgender communities asserting their historical presence, others suggest it represents a problematic distortion of historical record.[^137]

The controversy surrounding the 2017 documentary "The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson" highlighted tensions about authority and representation. Mariah Lopez, Johnson's niece, accused filmmaker David France of exploitative practices and criticized Tourmaline for allegedly working to silence Lopez's own organizing efforts.[^138] These accusations raise questions about who has the right to tell Johnson's story and whether documentary projects actually serve the communities they claim to represent or instead extract value while doing harm.[^139]

Some critics have noted the irony of Johnson being celebrated posthumously with expensive monuments and cultural productions when she lived in poverty and struggled to secure basic housing.[^140] The example of Andy Warhol's "Ladies and Gentlemen" series—for which Johnson was paid fifty dollars while the portraits later sold for thousands—exemplifies how marginalized artists and activists are often commodified without receiving fair compensation.[^141] This pattern continues today as Johnson's image generates cultural and economic capital that doesn't materially benefit the communities she fought for.[^142]

Finally, some activists have expressed concern that the focus on historical figures like Johnson, while important, can substitute for addressing urgent contemporary issues facing transgender people, particularly Black trans women who experience disproportionate rates of violence, poverty, and criminalization.[^143] Honoring Johnson's legacy, these critics argue, requires not just commemorative gestures but concrete action to address the conditions she fought against, which persist and in some ways have intensified.[^144]
