## Summary

Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi was a German mathematician who made fundamental contributions to elliptic functions, dynamics, differential equations, and number theory. He introduced the Jacobian determinant, essential in multivariable calculus and coordinate transformations. His work on elliptic functions with Abel shaped 19th-century mathematics. The Hamilton-Jacobi equation is fundamental to classical mechanics and quantum theory.
