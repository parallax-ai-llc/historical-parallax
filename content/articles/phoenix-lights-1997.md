## Summary

The Phoenix Lights is one of the most widely witnessed UFO events in history. On the night of March 13, 1997, thousands of people across Nevada, Arizona, and the Mexican state of Sonora reported seeing a massive, V-shaped formation of lights moving silently across the night sky. The sightings occurred in a corridor stretching over 300 miles, from Henderson, Nevada, to Tucson, Arizona.[^1]

The event describes two distinct phenomena: a massive triangular craft that blotted out the stars (approx. 8:00 PM - 8:30 PM) and a later series of stationary, amber orbs seen hovering over the Sierra Estrella mountains (approx. 10:00 PM). While the military officially explained the second event as flares, the earlier sighting of the "mile-wide" silent craft remains unexplained and was famously witnessed by the state's governor, Fife Symington.[^2]

## The Two Events

### Event 1: The V-Shaped Craft (8:15 PM - 8:45 PM)

Reports began coming in from northern Arizona (Prescott, Dewey) of a huge object flying south.

- **Description:** Witnesses described a giant "carpenter's square" or boomerang-shaped object. It allegedly had five spherical lights or engines.
- **Size:** Descriptions varied from "the size of a jetliner" to "three miles wide."
- **Movement:** It moved slowly and completely silently at a low altitude.
- **The "Blocking Out Stars" Effect:** Crucially, witnesses reported that the object was not just lights flying in formation, but a solid structure that blocked out the view of the stars behind it as it passed overhead.[^3]

### Event 2: The Orbs (10:00 PM)

Later that night, a different phenomenon was seen by thousands in the Phoenix valley.

- **Description:** A row of brilliant amber lights appeared over the Sierra Estrella mountains to the southwest. They hovered, then slowly drifted and faded out one by one.
- **Documentation:** This event was captured on video by many residents and news crews, becoming the iconic footage associated with the "Phoenix Lights."[^4]

## The Governor's Confession

At the time, Arizona Governor **Fife Symington III** held a press conference where he ridiculed the panic by bringing out his chief of staff dressed in an alien costume. It seemed to be a denial.

**The Turn:** Ten years later, in 2007, Symington came forward with a shocking admission. He revealed that he had personally witnessed the first event (the V-shaped craft) and had lied to prevent public hysteria.

> "I'm a pilot and I know just about every machine that flies. It was bigger than anything that I've ever seen. It remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it... It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too." — _Fife Symington_[^5]

## Official Explanations vs. Skepticism

### The Flare Theory (For Event 2)

The U.S. Air Force explained the 10:00 PM lights as **LUU-2B/B illumination flares** dropped by A-10 Warthog aircraft from the Maryland Air National Guard during a training exercise at the Barry Goldwater Range.

- **Validity:** This explanation is widely accepted for the _second_ event (the orbs), as the disappearance of the lights behind the mountain range matches the profile of falling flares.[^6]

### The Formation Theory (For Event 1)

Skeptics (like Mitch Stanley, an amateur astronomer) claimed the V-shape was a formation of planes.

- **Counter-argument:** This does not explain the "blocking out stars" phenomenon reported by witnesses, nor the absolute silence of a formation that large moving at low altitude. Commercial and military pilots who witnessed it stated wind direction made it impossible for a formation of planes to appear "stationary" or "hovering" as described.[^7]

| ------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fife Symington**  | Governor of Arizona | "It was an other-worldly geometric structure... it challenged my reality."                                                         |
| **Kurt Russell**    | Actor / Pilot       | Was flying his private plane into Phoenix. Reported "six lights in a V-shape" to the tower.                                        |
| **Dr. Lynne Kitei** | Physician           | Photographed similar lights prior to the mass sighting; became a leading researcher on the topic.                                  |
| **Tim Ley**         | Witness             | Watched the object pass directly over his house with his family, describing it as a silent "structure" with lights embedded in it. |

## Legacy

The Phoenix Lights remains unique because of the sheer volume of witnesses (thousands) and the high-profile confirmation from a sitting Governor. It spawned a documentary (_The Phoenix Lights_) and remains a heated topic of debate. It stands as the quintessential example of a "Mass Sighting" event where the "swamp gas" or "weather balloon" explanations failed to satisfy the public.[^8]
