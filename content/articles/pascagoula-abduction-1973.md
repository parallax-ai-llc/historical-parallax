## Summary

The Pascagoula Abduction is one of the strangest and most unsettling close encounters on record. On the night of October 11, 1973, two shipyard workers—**Charles Hickson** (42) and **Calvin Parker** (19)—were fishing off a pier when they claimed they were paralyzed and floated aboard an alien craft by robotic, crab-clawed creatures.

Unlike many abduction stories that emerge years later through hypnosis, this was reported immediately. The case is famous because the local sheriff, suspecting a hoax, left the two men alone in an interrogation room with a **hidden tape recorder** running. Instead of dropping the act, the two men continued to talk to each other in sheer terror, praying and crying about what they had just seen, which convinced the police of their sincerity.[^1]

## The Incident (Oct 11, 1973)

### The Encounter
Hickson and Parker were fishing on the west bank of the Pascagoula River. Around 9:00 PM, they heard a whirring/zipping sound.
*   **The Ship:** An oval-shaped object (football-shaped) with blue blinking lights descended behind them.
*   **The Beings:** Three creatures floated out of the craft. They were about 5 feet tall, grayish, with wrinkled skin like an elephant. They had no neck (head sat on shoulders), slit-like mouths, and pointed ears. Most famously, they had **crab-like claws** instead of hands and legs that were fused together.
*   **The Abduction:** Hickson and Parker were frozen (paralyzed) but conscious. The creatures floated them into the ship.[^2]

### Inside the Craft
Hickson described being floated into a brightly lit room.
*   **The Eye:** A giant mechanical "eye" (football-shaped device) floated around his body, seemingly scanning him. He felt no pain but was terrified.
*   **Parker's Trauma:** Calvin Parker passed out from fear at the beginning and remembered little of the interior until much later in life.

### The Release
After about 20 minutes, they were floated back out and deposited on the riverbank. The craft shot straight up and vanished. Parker was weeping and praying on the ground.

## The Investigation

### The "Secret Tape"
They debated telling anyone but eventually went to the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff **Fred Diamond** thought they were drunk or lying.
*   ** The Setup:** Diamond put them in a room with a hidden microphone and left.
*   **The Transcript:**
    *   *Parker:* "I got to get home and get to bed or get some nerve pills or see the doctor or something. I can't stand it. I'm about to go crazy."
    *   *Hickson:* "I tell you, when we're through, I'll get you something to settle you down so you can get some damn sleep."
    *   *Parker:* "I can't sleep yet like it is. I'm just damn near crazy."
    *   *Hickson:* "they could have [harmed us], son. They could have harmed us... but they didn't."
    *   *Parker (praying):* "Jesus Christ, have mercy."
*   **The Verdict:** Hearing this raw panic convinced the Sheriff that "if they were lying to me, they should be in Hollywood."[^3]

### Polygraph
Charles Hickson passed a lie detector test shortly after the event. The examiner concluded he believed he was telling the truth.

## Aftermath and Legacy

*   **Charles Hickson:** Became a public figure, wrote a book, and never wavered from his story until his death in 2011.
*   **Calvin Parker:** Avoided the spotlight for decades, suffering from what looked like PTSD. He finally wrote his own book in 2018, confirming the story and adding details he had repressed. He died in 2023.
*   **The Marker:** In 2019, the city of Pascagoula erected a historical marker at the site of the abduction, recognizing it as a piece of local history.[^4]
