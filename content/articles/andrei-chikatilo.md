## Summary
Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo, known as the "Butcher of Rostov" and the "Red Ripper," was a Soviet serial killer who committed at least 52 murders between 1978 and 1990. His victims were primarily women and children whom he lured to secluded areas. He is one of the most prolific serial killers in Russian history, and his case exposed significant flaws in Soviet law enforcement.

## Early Life
Andrei Chikatilo was born on October 16, 1936, in Yabluchne, Ukrainian SSR, during the devastating Holodomor famine. His mother told him his older brother had been kidnapped and cannibalized by starving neighbors, though historians question this claim. He grew up in extreme poverty and suffered chronic bed-wetting, for which he was severely beaten. Despite academic struggles, he earned a degree in Russian literature and worked as a teacher. He married in 1963 and had two children. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Chikatilo committed his first murder in 1978, killing a 9-year-old girl in Shakhty. He continued killing over the next 12 years, targeting runaways, homeless people, and young women at bus and train stations across the Rostov Oblast and other regions. He would lure victims to wooded areas where he attacked them with knives. His murders involved extreme mutilation and sexual violence. An innocent man, Alexander Kravchenko, was wrongfully convicted and executed for Chikatilo's first murder. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
A massive Soviet police operation codenamed "Forest Strip" was launched to catch the killer. Chikatilo was first detained in 1984 but released due to a blood type testing error. He was finally apprehended on November 20, 1990, after being spotted near the scene of his latest murder. He confessed to 56 murders, of which investigators confirmed 52. He was convicted on October 15, 1992, and executed by a single gunshot on February 14, 1994. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His case led to reforms in Soviet/Russian forensic investigation techniques [^4]
- Exposed critical failures in the Soviet police system, including wrongful convictions
- Prompted international cooperation in forensic science between Russia and Western nations

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered at least 52 people, including many children [^5]
- His crimes went undetected for 12 years due to Soviet bureaucratic failures
- An innocent man was executed for his first murder
- Targeted society's most vulnerable — homeless youth, runaways, and people with disabilities
- Committed extreme acts of mutilation on his victims
