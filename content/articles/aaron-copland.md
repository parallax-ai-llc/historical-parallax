## Summary

Aaron Copland (November 14, 1900 – December 2, 1990) was an American composer, conductor, pianist, teacher, and critic widely regarded as the "Dean of American Music."[^1][^2] Born to Russian-Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, New York, Copland created a distinctly American sound in classical music by incorporating folk melodies, jazz rhythms, and themes celebrating the American landscape and spirit.[^3] His most celebrated works include the ballets *Appalachian Spring* (1944), *Billy the Kid* (1938), and *Rodeo* (1942), as well as *Fanfare for the Common Man* (1942).[^4][^5] Beyond composition, Copland profoundly influenced American music through his teaching, writing, conducting, and tireless promotion of contemporary American composers.[^6]

## Early Life and Background

Aaron Copland was born on November 14, 1900, in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of five children in a Conservative Jewish immigrant family.[^7][^8] His parents, Harris Morris Copland and Sarah Mittenthal Copland, were Lithuanian Jews who had emigrated from Russia.[^9] While immigrating to the United States, Copland's father lived and worked in Scotland for two to three years to pay for his boat fare, and it was during this period that he likely Anglicized the family surname from "Kaplan" to "Copland."[^10]

Throughout his childhood, Copland and his family lived above his parents' Brooklyn shop, H. M. Copland's, at 628 Washington Avenue on the corner of Dean Street and Washington Avenue.[^11] The household was not particularly musical, though Copland's early exposure to music came primarily through Jewish weddings and ceremonies, as well as occasional family musicales.[^12] His older sister Laurine gave him his first piano lessons when he was around eleven years old, promoted his musical education, and supported him throughout his musical career.[^13]

Copland began writing songs at the remarkably young age of eight and a half.[^14] His earliest notated music, composed at age eleven, consisted of about seven bars for an opera scenario he created and called *Zenatello*.[^15] After attending a concert by the renowned Polish composer-pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski at age fifteen, Copland made the definitive decision to become a composer.[^16] He later recalled this moment as transformative, marking the beginning of his serious commitment to music.

Copland attended Boys High School in Brooklyn and spent summers at various camps.[^17] From 1913 to 1917, he took piano lessons with Leopold Wolfsohn, who introduced him to the standard classical repertoire.[^18] After high school, he received additional piano instruction from Victor Wittgenstein, who described the young Copland as "quiet, shy, well-mannered, and gracious in accepting criticism."[^19] At age seventeen, Copland began studying composition with Rubin Goldmark (also known as Karl Goldmark in some sources), a well-known composer trained in the German Romantic tradition, and remained under his tutelage for four years.[^20][^21]

In 1921, Copland made a pivotal decision that would shape his entire career: he enrolled at the newly-established American Conservatory at Fontainebleau, France.[^22] There, he came under the influence of the legendary pedagogue Nadia Boulanger, beginning composition studies with her in October of that year.[^23] Boulanger became one of the most important influences on Copland's compositional development, and he studied with her from 1921 to 1924.[^24] She recognized his talent immediately and helped him develop a disciplined approach to composition while encouraging him to find his own distinctive voice.

## Rise to Prominence

Copland's professional career was effectively launched on January 11, 1925, when the New York Symphony Orchestra premiered his *Symphony for Organ and Orchestra*, with Nadia Boulanger herself as the organ soloist.[^25] This performance introduced Copland to American audiences as a promising young composer and marked his arrival on the national music scene. The work showcased his early modernist tendencies and the rigorous training he had received in France.

In the mid-1920s, Copland experimented with incorporating jazz rhythms into classical forms, producing works such as *Music for the Theater* (1925) and the *Piano Concerto* (1926).[^26] These compositions reflected the cosmopolitan atmosphere of the Jazz Age and demonstrated Copland's interest in creating a uniquely American musical idiom that drew from popular culture. In 1927, he gave his first major performance as a pianist, presenting the world premiere of his Piano Concerto with conductor Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.[^27]

From 1928 to 1931, Copland collaborated with composer Roger Sessions to sponsor the Copland-Sessions Concerts, a groundbreaking series dedicated to performances of new music in New York.[^28] These concerts provided a vital platform for contemporary American and European composers at a time when modern music struggled to find audiences. Copland also began lecturing at the New School for Social Research in New York in 1927, establishing himself as an articulate spokesperson for modern music.[^29]

In 1930, Copland composed two significant works that demonstrated his evolving style: the *Dance Symphony* and the austere, modernist *Piano Variations*.[^30] The latter work, in particular, became a landmark of American modernism, admired by fellow composers for its uncompromising dissonance and rigorous structure, though it initially puzzled general audiences.

During the 1930s, Copland became increasingly concerned that his modernist compositions were reaching only a limited, elite audience. In 1932, he helped organize plans for the Yaddo Festival of American Music, further cementing his role as an advocate for American composers.[^31] From 1933 to 1944, he taught at Harvard University in the absence of composer and theorist Walter Piston, exposing a new generation of students to contemporary compositional techniques.[^32]

The pivotal shift in Copland's compositional approach came around 1936, when he began concentrating on more accessible works that incorporated American folk themes and were designed to reach broader audiences.[^33] He started writing music for high school musicians and then moved on to composing ballets based on American themes. This "populist" or "vernacular" style, as it came to be known, would produce his most beloved and enduring works.

## Major Achievements

Copland's most significant achievements came during the 1930s and 1940s, when he created a series of works that came to define the sound of American classical music. His ballet scores *Billy the Kid* (1938), *Rodeo* (1942), and *Appalachian Spring* (1944) became iconic representations of the American frontier spirit and landscape.[^34][^35] These works incorporated folk melodies, open harmonies, and rhythmic vitality that evoked the vastness of the American West and the optimism of American culture.

*Appalachian Spring*, created in collaboration with the pioneering choreographer Martha Graham, stands as perhaps Copland's greatest masterpiece.[^36] The score incorporates the Shaker hymn "Simple Gifts" and perfectly suited Graham's Americana style of modern dance. The work won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1945, cementing Copland's status as America's preeminent composer.[^37][^38] In 1950, he also won an Academy Award for his film score, further demonstrating his versatility.[^39]

*Fanfare for the Common Man*, composed in 1942 in response to a request from conductor Eugene Goossens for a musical tribute honoring those engaged in World War II, became one of the most recognizable pieces of American music.[^40][^41] Premiered on March 12, 1943, this three-minute work for brass and percussion stirred patriotic feelings and became a lasting symbol of American democratic ideals.[^42] Copland later incorporated the fanfare's theme into the finale of his monumental *Third Symphony* (1944–46), creating one of his most ambitious orchestral statements.[^43]

Copland's film scores for Hollywood productions, including *Our Town* (1940) and *The Red Pony* (1948), brought his music to even wider audiences and demonstrated his ability to work effectively in commercial contexts without compromising his artistic integrity.[^44][^45] In 1948, he wrote the *Clarinet Concerto* for jazz virtuoso Benny Goodman, a work that bridged classical and jazz idioms and was later used by choreographer Jerome Robbins for the ballet *Pied Piper*.[^46]

Beyond his popular works, Copland continued to produce challenging modernist compositions for more specialized audiences. His *Piano Quartet* (1950) and song cycle based on poems by Emily Dickinson demonstrated his ability to work in both populist and modernist styles simultaneously.[^47] Later significant works include the complex *Piano Fantasy* (1957), *Connotations* (1962), commissioned for the opening of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York City, and *Inscape* (1967).[^48][^49]

In 1951, Copland became the first composer honored with the Charles Eliot Norton Professorship of Poetics at Harvard University, where he delivered a series of lectures that were subsequently published as *Music and Imagination*.[^50] This book, along with his earlier classic *What to Listen For in Music* (1939), established Copland as one of the most articulate writers about music for general audiences. His clear, accessible prose demystified classical music and encouraged active listening.

From 1940 to 1965, Copland served as the first compositional faculty member at Serge Koussevitzky's Berkshire Music Center (later renamed the Tanglewood Music Center), where he mentored numerous young composers.[^51] His influence as a teacher extended to countless students who would go on to shape American music in subsequent decades. Through his work as a conductor, particularly in his later years, Copland also championed the music of his contemporaries and helped establish a repertoire of American orchestral music.

On September 14, 1964, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented Copland with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.[^52] The citation read: "Masterful composer and gifted teacher, his music echoes our American experience and speaks expressively to an international audience."[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his immense contributions to American music, Copland faced significant political persecution during the Second Red Scare of the late 1940s and 1950s. Between the 1930s and 1950s, Copland had joined the left-leaning populist Popular Front, composed protest songs, written *Lincoln Portrait* and *Fanfare for the Common Man*, traveled to South America on cultural missions, spoke at the Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace, and donated to communist-leaning organizations such as the American-Soviet Musical Society.[^54][^55]

On June 22, 1950, Copland was labeled a Communist sympathizer in the infamous publication "Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television," along with other renowned musicians and performers including Leonard Bernstein, Lena Horne, Pete Seeger, and Artie Shaw.[^56][^57] The FBI investigated Copland during this period, and he found himself blacklisted from certain professional opportunities.[^58]

The most humiliating incident occurred in 1953, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower's Inaugural Concert Committee censored a planned performance of Copland's patriotic work *Lincoln Portrait* due to the composer's perceived communist leanings.[^59] The irony of banning such an overtly American work was not lost on observers, but the political climate made such censorship possible. In April 1953, Senator Joseph McCarthy successfully lobbied the State Department to blacklist music and recordings by Copland, Leonard Bernstein, and others from American libraries sponsored by the U.S. government overseas.[^60] Copland's passport was also revoked, preventing him from traveling internationally.[^61]

In 1953, Copland was summoned to testify in a closed hearing before Senators Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn about his political activities and affiliations.[^62] The House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) questioned him extensively about his communist connections. During his testimony, Copland clearly denied any formal communist affiliations or party membership.[^63] He later acknowledged in oral histories that he had been a "fellow traveler" in the 1930s because "it seemed the thing to do at the time," but insisted he had never joined any political party.[^64]

Copland's performance before the committee was remarkable for its careful navigation of dangerous political waters. He was considered a friendly but not particularly cooperative witness—he named no names and managed to evade direct questions about his own political leanings throughout the 1930s and 1940s.[^65] The investigations formally ended in 1955, but the experience left lasting scars on Copland and affected his career opportunities for years.

Some music critics also questioned Copland's shift from modernist complexity to accessible populism in the late 1930s. Certain avant-garde composers and critics viewed his "vernacular" works as a compromise of artistic integrity in favor of popular appeal. However, Copland defended his decision, arguing that composers had a responsibility to reach broader audiences and that accessible music could still maintain high artistic standards. He believed that the modernist-populist divide was a false dichotomy and that a composer could work successfully in both idioms.

## Personal Life

Aaron Copland never married and had no children of his own, though he maintained close relationships with his siblings and their families throughout his life. His personal life was marked by his long-term relationship with Victor Kraft, which began in 1932 when Kraft was just sixteen years old and continued until Kraft's death in 1976.[^66][^67]

Victor Hugo Etler Kraftsov, known professionally as Victor Kraft (August 8, 1915 – July 2, 1976), was originally a violin prodigy when he met Copland in 1932.[^68] At Copland's urging, Kraft abandoned music to pursue a career in photography.[^69] Copland called Kraft his "pupil, companion, secretary and friend," a characterization that understated the romantic nature of their relationship.[^70] Throughout Kraft's career as a photographer, he was also employed by Copland as his secretary and chauffeur, and they lived together at various residences including Bernardsville, Ridgefield, Sneden's Landing, Ossining, and Cortlandt Manor.[^71]

The relationship between Copland and Kraft was complex and often turbulent. While their romance may have ended by 1944, Kraft remained a constant presence in Copland's life, leaving and re-entering repeatedly.[^72] Kraft's behavior became increasingly erratic over the years, sometimes confrontational, bringing considerable stress to Copland's life. Despite these difficulties, their bond endured. Copland became the godfather of Kraft's only child, Jeremy Aaron, who was mentally handicapped.[^73] Kraft had fathered the child with a woman, and Copland later provided financial security for the child through a bequest from his estate.[^74]

The relationship between Copland and Kraft remained unknown to the general public until after Copland's death in 1990.[^75] Copland was extremely discreet about his sexuality throughout his life, a necessity in an era when homosexuality could destroy careers and lead to criminal prosecution. When the openly gay composer Leonard Bernstein urged an aging Copland to come out publicly, Copland reportedly replied: "I think I'll leave that to you, boy."[^76]

Copland's personality was described by those who knew him as reserved, gracious, and deeply committed to his work. He was known for his generosity toward younger composers, his willingness to promote their work, and his patience as a teacher. Despite his fame, he maintained a relatively modest lifestyle and was more interested in advancing American music than in personal celebrity. Friends and colleagues remembered him as unfailingly courteous, with a dry wit and a keen intellect that extended beyond music to literature, visual arts, and politics.

## Legacy

Aaron Copland's legacy as the "Dean of American Music" rests on his success in creating a distinctly American sound in classical music and his tireless advocacy for American composers.[^77][^78] According to scholar Howard Pollack, Copland "had perhaps the most distinctive and identifiable musical voice produced by this country so far, an individuality ... that helped define for many what American concert music sounds like at its most characteristic and that exerted enormous influence on multitudes of contemporaries and successors."[^79]

The open, slowly changing harmonies characteristic of Copland's vernacular works came to define the sound of American music for many listeners, evoking the vast American landscape and pioneer spirit.[^80] His music captured the American experience by blending folk traditions, jazz idioms, and evocations of the frontier into a unique sound that continues to represent America in classical music contexts.[^81] Conductor Leon Botstein suggests that Copland "helped define the modern consciousness of America's ideals, character and sense of place."[^82]

One of Copland's colleagues noted: "Aaron brought leanness to America, which set the tone for our musical language throughout [World War II]. Thanks to Aaron, American music came into its own."[^83] This achievement was particularly significant because it helped American classical music establish an identity distinct from its European heritage. Before Copland, American composers often struggled to escape the perception that they were merely imitating European models.

Copland's influence extended far beyond his compositional output. As a teacher, lecturer, author, editor, and conductor, he shaped American musical culture through multiple channels.[^84] His integration of jazz elements into classical music was groundbreaking and played a significant role in establishing a distinctly American classical idiom.[^85] His inclusive approach to musical materials—drawing from folk songs, hymns, jazz, and Latin American music—demonstrated that serious concert music could incorporate vernacular sources without sacrificing artistic quality.

The institutional legacy Copland left is equally impressive. In 1981, the Department of Music at Queens College of the City University of New York was renamed the Aaron Copland School of Music in his honor.[^86] Copland House in Westchester County, New York, where he lived during his later years, has been preserved as a creative center for American music, hosting residencies for composers and presenting concerts.

In 1985, the year of Copland's 85th birthday, more than 100 American music organizations joined in celebrations across the country.[^87] He attended a concert at Lincoln Center on his actual birthday, November 14, and made his last public appearance at an Aaron Copland Day celebration at Tanglewood on July 24, 1985.[^88] These tributes demonstrated the profound affection and respect the American musical community held for him.

After 1970, Copland virtually stopped composing, though he continued to lecture and conduct through the mid-1980s.[^89] In 1984, with the assistance of Vivian Perlis, he published the first volume of his memoirs, *Copland: 1900 Through 1942*.[^90] On December 2, 1990, just weeks after his ninetieth birthday, Copland succumbed to Alzheimer's disease and respiratory failure.[^91] Following his death, his ashes were scattered over the Tanglewood Music Center near Lenox, Massachusetts, the summer home of the Boston Symphony Orchestra where he had taught and conducted for decades.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and musicians consistently praise Copland for fundamentally shaping the identity of American classical music. His ability to synthesize diverse musical influences—from French modernism learned under Nadia Boulanger to American folk traditions, jazz, and popular music—created a compositional voice that was both sophisticated and accessible. Music historians credit him with solving the long-standing problem of how American composers could create serious concert music with a distinctly national character without resorting to mere quotation or pastiche.

Copland's educational contributions receive particular acclaim. His books, especially *What to Listen For in Music*, have introduced countless readers to classical music appreciation and remain in print decades after their initial publication. His clear, jargon-free writing demonstrated that discussing music intelligently did not require obscure technical language. As a teacher at Tanglewood and Harvard, he mentored generations of composers who would carry forward his commitment to American music.

Conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein, himself one of America's most influential musical figures, considered Copland a mentor and inspiration. Bernstein frequently programmed Copland's works and championed his music internationally. The Presidential Medal of Freedom citation captured the widespread view of Copland's achievement: his music "echoes our American experience and speaks expressively to an international audience."[^93]

Copland's willingness to work in multiple idioms simultaneously—composing accessible ballets alongside challenging modernist works like the *Piano Fantasy*—is now seen as a strength rather than a compromise. Contemporary scholars appreciate his refusal to be confined by the modernist-populist debate and his insistence that composers could serve both specialized and general audiences without betraying their artistic principles.

His advocacy for other American composers, through the Copland-Sessions Concerts, his organizational work, and his willingness to promote younger composers, created institutional structures that supported American music long after his own career ended. Copland understood that building a national musical culture required more than individual achievement—it demanded community building, education, and advocacy.

### Negative Views

Despite Copland's towering reputation, some critics and scholars have raised questions about various aspects of his career and legacy. Certain avant-garde composers and theorists of the mid-20th century viewed Copland's turn toward accessibility in the late 1930s as a retreat from the uncompromising modernism of works like the *Piano Variations*. They argued that his populist works, while popular and well-crafted, represented an artistic compromise motivated by political ideology or commercial considerations rather than purely aesthetic concerns.

Some critics have noted that Copland's "American" sound relies heavily on specific rural and frontier imagery that represents only a limited aspect of the diverse American experience. The folk materials he drew upon were predominantly white Anglo-American and Mexican, with relatively little incorporation of African American musical traditions beyond jazz elements, despite the central role of Black music in American culture. This selective approach to what constitutes "American" music has been questioned by scholars interested in more inclusive representations of American diversity.

Copland's political activities during the 1930s and 1940s, while vindicated by history's condemnation of McCarthyism, troubled some contemporaries who believed artists should remain politically neutral. Some felt his involvement with leftist causes during the Popular Front period showed poor judgment, even if his sympathies were understandable given the economic devastation of the Great Depression and the rise of fascism in Europe.

Certain musicologists have argued that Copland's influence was so dominant that it may have constrained the development of alternative approaches to American composition. By establishing such a recognizable and successful model of what American music should sound like, he may have inadvertently made it more difficult for composers pursuing radically different aesthetics to gain recognition. The "Copland sound" became so synonymous with American music that composers working in other idioms sometimes struggled to be heard.

Some performers and scholars have also noted that Copland's later conducting of his own works, while historically valuable, sometimes lacked the vitality and precision of interpretations by specialist conductors. His conducting career, which expanded as his compositional output diminished, received mixed reviews from critics who felt he was more effective as a composer than as an interpreter.
