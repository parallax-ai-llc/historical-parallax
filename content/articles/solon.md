## Summary

Solon was an Athenian statesman, lawmaker, poet, and political philosopher who lived from approximately 638 to 558 BCE and is widely recognized as one of the founding fathers of Athenian democracy.[^1] Appointed as archon (chief magistrate) in 594 BCE during a period of severe social and economic crisis, Solon implemented sweeping reforms that cancelled debts, abolished debt slavery, and restructured Athens' political and legal systems.[^2] His revolutionary measures, known as the *seisachtheia* or "shaking off of burdens," laid the groundwork for democratic governance by expanding political participation beyond the aristocracy.[^3] Numbered among the Seven Sages of Greece, Solon was also a prolific poet who used verse to justify his political actions and articulate his philosophy of moderation and justice.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Solon was born around 638 BCE in Athens, though some ancient sources suggest dates ranging from 640 to 630 BCE, making precise chronology uncertain.[^5] He was the son of Execestides, a man of noble lineage who traced his ancestry back to Codrus, the legendary last king of Athens, placing Solon among the Eupatridae—Athens' hereditary aristocracy.[^6] Despite this distinguished pedigree, Solon's family circumstances were relatively modest by aristocratic standards. His father had depleted much of the family fortune through what ancient sources describe as "prodigal expenditure," leaving young Solon with an inheritance insufficient to maintain the lifestyle typical of his social class.[^7]

This financial situation had a formative influence on Solon's early life and worldview. Rather than relying solely on landed wealth like most aristocrats, Solon turned to maritime commerce in his youth, becoming a merchant trader.[^8] This career choice was somewhat unusual for someone of noble birth, as trade was generally considered beneath the dignity of the landed aristocracy. However, it provided Solon with experiences and perspectives that would later prove invaluable in his political career. Through his travels and commercial dealings, he gained firsthand knowledge of economic realities, exposure to different cultures and political systems, and an understanding of the challenges faced by ordinary citizens—insights that informed his later reforms.[^9]

Solon's education was thorough and befitting his social status. His father ensured that he received instruction that emphasized not merely practical skills but also the cultivation of wisdom, ethical values, and appreciation for human relationships.[^10] This educational foundation, combined with his commercial experiences and noble heritage, created a unique combination of perspectives. Solon developed a reputation for both intellectual brilliance and practical wisdom, qualities that would eventually bring him to the attention of his fellow Athenians during a period of national crisis.

Adding another layer to his social connections, Solon's mother was a cousin of the mother of Peisistratus, who would later become tyrant of Athens.[^11] This family relationship created a complex dynamic in Athenian politics, as Solon and Peisistratus represented different political philosophies despite their kinship—Solon advocating for balanced constitutional reform while Peisistratus would eventually seize power through tyranny.

## Rise to Power

Solon first emerged onto the wider Athenian political stage around 600 BCE during a prolonged and dispiriting conflict with the neighboring city-state of Megara over control of the strategically important island of Salamis.[^12] Athens had been unsuccessful in this war, and a law had even been passed forbidding anyone from proposing that Athens renew its claim to the island, on pain of death. The repeated failures had demoralized the Athenian population and damaged civic pride. Recognizing both the strategic importance of Salamis and the opportunity to galvanize public sentiment, Solon composed and publicly recited a poem that reframed the issue as a matter of national honor.[^13] His eloquent verses stirred Athenian patriotism and convinced the assembly to repeal the law and resume the war.

Solon then took an active military role in the renewed conflict. According to various accounts, he either defeated the Megarians through clever stratagems or through more direct military action.[^14] The success in the Salamis campaign, achieved around 595 BCE, dramatically elevated Solon's public profile and established him as a figure of both intellectual brilliance and practical capability. His reputation grew not merely as a military leader but as someone who could inspire civic unity and marshal public sentiment toward collective goals.

By 594 BCE, Athens faced a crisis far more severe than military defeat. The city was on the brink of civil war due to extreme economic inequality and social tensions between the aristocracy and the common people.[^15] Wealthy landowners had consolidated vast estates while many ordinary citizens had fallen into debt slavery, a practice where debtors who could not repay their obligations were enslaved or lost their land and freedom. Some Athenians had even been sold into slavery abroad. The poor majority, called the *demos*, demanded debt relief and redistribution of land, while the aristocratic elite resisted any changes that would diminish their wealth and privileges.[^16]

In this atmosphere of mutual hatred and fear, both sides recognized that a compromise was essential to prevent outright civil war. Solon emerged as the rare figure acceptable to both factions—respected by the aristocracy for his noble birth and intellectual achievements, yet trusted by the common people due to his reputation for fairness and his understanding of economic hardship from his merchant background.[^17] The Athenians elected Solon as archon eponymous (chief magistrate) and granted him extraordinary powers to draft new laws and restructure Athenian society, essentially making him a temporary constitutional dictator.[^18] He was approximately 35 years old when he assumed this immense responsibility, tasked with nothing less than preventing Athens from tearing itself apart.

## Major Achievements

Solon's reforms, implemented during his archonship in 594 BCE, were comprehensive and revolutionary, touching upon economic, political, social, and legal dimensions of Athenian life. These changes fundamentally restructured Athenian society and created the framework upon which later democratic institutions would be built.

### The Seisachtheia and Economic Reforms

The centerpiece of Solon's economic program was the *seisachtheia*, literally meaning "shaking off of burdens."[^19] This sweeping debt relief measure included several radical components. First, Solon cancelled all existing debts, providing immediate relief to those crushed by financial obligations they could never hope to repay.[^20] Second, he abolished the practice of using a debtor's person as security for loans, effectively ending debt slavery in Athens.[^21] Third, he freed all Athenians who had been enslaved due to debt. Fourth, he even arranged for the repatriation of Athenians who had been sold into slavery abroad, though locating and retrieving these individuals posed significant practical challenges.[^22]

The *seisachtheia* also involved the removal of the *horoi*—boundary stones that marked land as mortgaged property, symbolizing the creditor's claim.[^23] The disappearance of these stones throughout Attica symbolized the liberation of the land and its people from the burden of debt. Additionally, Solon abolished the status of the *hectemoroi* or "sixth-parters," agricultural laborers who had worked in a form of serfdom, owing one-sixth of their produce to landowners.[^24]

Beyond debt relief, Solon implemented measures to stimulate economic growth and diversify the Athenian economy. His reforms succeeded in promoting foreign trade, with Athenian black-figure pottery exports increasing substantially between 600 and 560 BCE.[^25] He encouraged skilled craftsmen from other regions to settle in Athens, offering them citizenship in exchange for bringing their expertise.[^26] These policies helped transform Athens from a primarily agricultural economy into a more diverse commercial center.

### Political and Constitutional Reforms

Solon's political reforms fundamentally altered the power structure of Athens while avoiding the extremes demanded by either faction. He ended the aristocracy's exclusive monopoly on political power, substituting a system based on wealth rather than birth—a significant step toward broader political participation, though still far from full democracy.[^27]

Central to this restructuring was Solon's division of Athenian citizens into four property classes based on agricultural production, measured in *medimnoi* (units of grain):[^28]

1. **Pentakosiomedimnoi** ("500-bushel men"): Those whose estates produced at least 500 medimnoi annually. Only this class could hold the highest offices, including the archonship.

2. **Hippeis** ("knights"): Those producing 300-500 medimnoi. This class could serve in the cavalry and hold most other offices.

3. **Zeugitai** ("yoke men"): Those producing 200-300 medimnoi or skilled craftsmen. They could serve as hoplites (heavy infantry) and hold lower offices.

4. **Thetes** ("laborers"): Those producing less than 200 medimnoi. Though they could not hold office, Solon crucially granted them participation in the popular assembly and law courts.

This system was revolutionary because it substituted economic criteria for birthright, allowing wealthy non-aristocrats to enter the political class while preserving a hierarchical structure that maintained stability.[^29]

Solon established or reformed several key political institutions. He created a *boule* (council) of 400 members—100 from each of the four traditional Athenian tribes—to prepare business for the assembly and provide ongoing governance.[^30] He empowered the *Ecclesia* (popular assembly), opening it to all male citizens regardless of class, making it the sovereign body entitled to pass laws and decrees, elect officials, and hear appeals.[^31] This represented a fundamental shift in sovereignty from the aristocracy to a broader citizen body.

Perhaps most revolutionary was Solon's establishment of the *Heliaia*, a popular court where citizens could appeal decisions made by magistrates.[^32] He also introduced the principle that any citizen—not merely the injured party—could bring a lawsuit on behalf of the community, establishing the concept of public prosecution and civic responsibility.[^33] These judicial reforms gave ordinary citizens unprecedented power to check the actions of wealthy and powerful individuals.

### Legal Reforms

Solon undertook a comprehensive revision of Athenian law, replacing the notoriously harsh legal code established by Draco with more humane statutes.[^34] The Draconian laws, famous for prescribing death for even minor offenses (giving us the word "draconian"), were almost entirely repealed, with Solon retaining only Draco's laws concerning homicide.[^35]

Solon's new legal code was inscribed on wooden tablets and displayed publicly, making the law accessible to all citizens rather than the preserve of aristocratic magistrates who had previously interpreted traditional law according to their interests.[^36] This transparency was crucial for establishing the rule of law and legal equality, core principles of later democratic governance.

### Literary Achievements

Unlike most ancient legislators, Solon was also a distinguished poet who used verse as a medium for political communication and philosophical reflection.[^37] He composed elegiac poetry to explain and justify his reforms to the Athenian people, to articulate his vision of justice and moderation, and to defend himself against critics.[^38] His poems combined artistry with statesmanship, offering reflections on governance, human nature, justice, and the proper ordering of society.

Through his poetry, Solon defended his middle course between the demands of the rich and poor, explaining why he refused to establish a tyranny or to redistribute land equally—the latter being a demand of the poorest citizens.[^39] His verses reveal a sophisticated political philosophy centered on balance, moderation, and the rule of law rather than the rule of men.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his enduring reputation as a wise lawgiver, Solon faced substantial criticism both from his contemporaries and from later scholars. His reforms, designed to satisfy both aristocrats and common people, ultimately left both sides disappointed, illustrating the difficulty of finding middle ground in times of extreme social tension.[^40]

### Contemporary Criticisms

The implementation of the *seisachtheia* angered wealthy creditors who saw their loans cancelled and their collateral freed, representing a massive transfer of wealth and economic expectations.[^41] Many aristocrats felt betrayed by one of their own class and resented the elevation of wealthy non-nobles into political positions previously reserved for hereditary elites. Conversely, the poor were disappointed that Solon refused to redistribute land equally among all citizens, a radical measure they had hoped would follow debt cancellation.[^42] His refusal to pursue this further leveling meant that wealth inequality, though reduced, persisted in Athens.

The dissatisfaction from both sides created a volatile political situation. As Solon himself noted in his poetry, "In attempting to satisfy all, he had satisfied none."[^43] This middle course, while preventing immediate civil war, did not establish lasting political stability. Solon's reforms failed to prevent the factional strife and political chaos that plagued Athens in the decades following his archonship.

### Short-term Political Failures

After completing his legislative work, Solon made the controversial decision to leave Athens for ten years, reportedly traveling to Egypt, Cyprus, and Lydia.[^44] His stated purpose was to prevent Athenians from pressuring him to modify or repeal his laws—he had required the Athenians to swear an oath to maintain his laws unchanged for ten years.[^45] However, this self-imposed exile removed his stabilizing presence from Athenian politics at a critical moment.

In Solon's absence, Athens descended into renewed factional conflict and eventually anarchy.[^46] Political disputes over high appointments plagued the city, and no archons could be elected for certain years due to the intensity of factional rivalry. Eventually, Solon's own relative, Peisistratus, exploited this instability to seize power as tyrant, first in 561 BCE and then twice more after being expelled.[^47] Peisistratus established a tyranny that, while relatively benign and even beneficial in some respects, represented the very antithesis of Solon's constitutional vision. The fact that tyranny emerged so soon after Solon's reforms has led some historians to view his legislative program as a short-term failure.

### Legal and Philosophical Criticisms

Later critics, including Aristotle, noted significant problems with Solon's laws.[^48] In his *Athenian Constitution*, Aristotle observed that Solon's statutes were often vague and open to multiple interpretations, leading to numerous legal disputes and inconsistent application. This ambiguity may have been deliberate—allowing flexibility for future development—or it may have reflected the difficulty of drafting comprehensive legislation under time pressure. Regardless, it created practical problems for Athenian legal administration.

Some scholars, including Fränkel and Spira, criticized the quality of Solon's poetry, suggesting it lacked the artistic excellence of other Greek poets.[^49] While this criticism is more aesthetic than political, it challenges the idealized portrait of Solon as both a brilliant statesman and accomplished artist.

### Historical Controversies

Modern scholarship has raised questions about the historicity of various aspects of Solon's life and reforms. The ancient sources—primarily Plutarch's biography written centuries after Solon's death—blend historical information with legendary embellishments, making it difficult to determine exactly what Solon actually did.[^50] There is scholarly debate about the authenticity of some poems attributed to Solon and disagreement about the precise nature and extent of the *seisachtheia*. Some historians interpret it as complete debt cancellation, while others view it as the abolition of a specific type of feudal relationship rather than universal debt relief.[^51]

These uncertainties mean that Solon remains a controversial figure in ancient history, with "diametrically opposed views on the validity of the ascription of the poems themselves to Solon."[^52] The historical Solon may have been considerably different from the idealized wise lawgiver of tradition.

### Criticisms of Conservatism

Some modern commentators criticize Solon for not going far enough in his reforms. By maintaining a property-based hierarchy and refusing to redistribute land, Solon preserved significant economic inequality in Athens. His constitution still excluded the poorest citizens (the *thetes*) from holding office, limiting their political participation to the assembly and courts. From this perspective, Solon's reforms represented a conservative compromise that delayed rather than achieved genuine democracy and equality.

---

## Personal Life

The ancient sources provide relatively limited information about Solon's personal life, focusing primarily on his public achievements. However, some details about his character, relationships, and personal philosophy emerge from the historical record.

Solon never married, and there is no reliable record of him having children, though some later sources claim he adopted his nephew's son.[^53] This absence of direct descendants may have reinforced his image as someone devoted entirely to the public good rather than personal dynasty-building—a notable contrast with many Greek aristocrats who sought to establish family political legacies.

His friendship with Peisistratus, despite their eventual political differences, reveals the complexity of his personal relationships. Peisistratus was related to Solon through their mothers, and ancient sources suggest a close personal bond in their younger years.[^54] Some accounts hint at a romantic relationship between them, though these stories may be later embellishments. Regardless of the exact nature of their relationship, Solon's reaction to Peisistratus's seizure of power was reportedly one of profound disappointment rather than anger—he famously appeared in the agora wearing his armor to protest the tyranny but was too old and politically isolated to prevent it.[^55]

Solon's travels during his self-imposed exile reveal his intellectual curiosity and desire for knowledge. His visit to Egypt, where he reportedly met with Pharaoh Amasis II, exposed him to one of the ancient world's oldest civilizations.[^56] According to Herodotus and Plato, Solon engaged in philosophical conversations with Egyptian priests, who allegedly shared with him the story of Atlantis—though modern scholars generally regard this as Plato's invention rather than historical fact.[^57] These travels reflect Solon's commitment to learning and his maxim "I grow old ever learning many things."[^58]

His personality, as revealed through his poetry and actions, combined aristocratic pride with genuine concern for justice and the common good. He was evidently a man of strong principles who resisted enormous pressure from both the wealthy and the poor to favor their respective interests exclusively. His famous philosophical commitment to "Nothing in excess" and moderation (*sophrosyne*) appears to have governed both his political decisions and personal conduct.[^59]

Ancient sources portray Solon as someone who valued honor and reputation highly, once stating "Consider your honour, as a gentleman, of more weight than an oath."[^60] He lived modestly despite his noble status, having learned from his father's financial mistakes and his own commercial experiences the value of prudent resource management.

Solon died around 558 BCE, approximately at age 80, having witnessed both the implementation of his reforms and the failure of Athens to maintain political stability in their aftermath.[^61] The tradition holds that he died in Cyprus, though the exact circumstances of his death are unknown. His final years were reportedly marked by the sadness of seeing his relative Peisistratus establish a tyranny, the very form of government Solon had worked to prevent.

## Legacy

Solon's influence on Western political thought and democratic governance extends far beyond his lifetime and the borders of ancient Athens. His reforms, philosophical principles, and example as a lawgiver have resonated through more than two millennia of political development.

### Foundation of Athenian Democracy

Solon's most significant legacy was laying the groundwork for Athenian democracy, even though he did not create a fully democratic system himself.[^62] His reforms broke the aristocracy's monopoly on political power, established the principle of citizen participation in governance, and created institutions—particularly the popular assembly and law courts—that would become central to classical Athenian democracy. Later reformers, particularly Cleisthenes in 508-507 BCE and Ephialtes in 462 BCE, built upon Solon's foundations to create the radical democracy for which Athens became famous.[^63]

Aristotle himself, writing in the *Athenian Constitution*, described Solon as "the first people's champion," recognizing his pivotal role in shifting political power toward the broader citizen body.[^64] While Solon maintained significant inequalities and hierarchies, his reforms established the crucial principle that political power should derive from the citizen community rather than from aristocratic birthright alone.

### Legal and Constitutional Principles

Solon established several legal principles that became foundational to Western jurisprudence. The concept of public prosecution—that any citizen could bring charges on behalf of the community—created a mechanism for civic participation in justice and accountability that extends into modern legal systems.[^65] His establishment of popular courts where citizens could appeal the decisions of magistrates created an early form of judicial review and check on executive power.

The very act of writing down laws and displaying them publicly represented a revolutionary commitment to transparency and the rule of law.[^66] This principle—that law should be public, written, and equally applicable to all citizens rather than the private knowledge of an elite—underlies modern constitutional governance.

### Influence on Political Philosophy

Solon's philosophical commitment to moderation, balance, and avoiding extremes influenced subsequent Greek political thought and continues to inform political philosophy today.[^67] His famous maxim "Nothing in excess" (*meden agan*) became a cornerstone of Greek ethical thought and was inscribed at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi alongside other wisdom sayings. His attempt to find a middle course between oligarchy and mob rule, between the interests of the wealthy and the poor, exemplifies a moderate approach to political reform that has influenced reformist political movements throughout history.

As one of the Seven Sages of Greece, Solon's philosophical and ethical teachings, expressed through his poetry, contributed to the intellectual foundations of Western civilization.[^68] His reflections on justice, the proper use of wealth, civic responsibility, and the relationship between individual virtue and social harmony informed later Greek philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle.

### Model of the Ethical Lawgiver

Solon became the archetypal wise lawgiver in Greek tradition, invoked as an example whenever cities considered constitutional reform. His example demonstrated that fundamental political change could be achieved through reason, persuasion, and compromise rather than through violence or tyranny. His refusal to use his extraordinary powers to establish himself as tyrant, despite having the opportunity, became a powerful example of civic virtue prioritizing the common good over personal ambition.[^69]

Later Greek cities and leaders frequently looked to Solon's example when undertaking their own reforms, and Roman thinkers such as Cicero praised him as a model of the philosopher-statesman.[^70] This tradition of the wise lawgiver who restructures society according to rational principles influenced Enlightenment political thinkers and the framers of modern constitutions.

### Impact on Modern Democracy

Solon's reforms have had an enduring impact on modern democratic theory and practice.[^71] The concepts of citizenship, political participation, equality before the law, and constitutional governance that he pioneered or advanced became fundamental to Western political development. Modern democracies' emphasis on written constitutions, separation of powers, judicial review, and citizen participation in government all have conceptual roots that can be traced back through Solon's innovations.[^72]

Scholars of democracy and political development recognize Solon's reforms as a crucial turning point in human political organization—the moment when an ancient society consciously restructured itself according to principles of broader political participation and legal equality rather than traditional aristocratic hierarchy.[^73] His example demonstrates that intentional constitutional design and reform can fundamentally alter political systems, a principle that has inspired revolutionary and reform movements throughout modern history.

### Cultural and Educational Legacy

Solon's integration of poetry with political philosophy created a model of the engaged intellectual who uses artistic expression for civic purposes.[^74] His poems, which survive only in fragments, continue to be studied for their insights into archaic Greek society, political thought, and the role of literature in public life. Educational systems from ancient times to the present have used Solon's life and works as teaching tools for ethics, political science, and classical literature.

The historiographical tradition of studying Solon's reforms, debating their exact nature and impact, and comparing them with other constitutional developments has itself been influential in shaping how historians and political scientists analyze political change and reform movements.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern and ancient scholarship has consistently recognized Solon's pivotal role in Athenian and Greek political development. Scholars credit him with preventing civil war through his timely and balanced reforms, thereby preserving Athens as a functioning polity that could later develop into history's first democracy.[^75] His debt relief and abolition of debt slavery represented a humanitarian achievement of enormous significance, liberating thousands of Athenians from bondage and preventing the perpetual enslavement of the poor by the wealthy.

Political scientists and historians of democracy view Solon's constitutional innovations—particularly the empowerment of the popular assembly and establishment of popular courts—as revolutionary developments in governance.[^76] By substituting wealth for birth as the criterion for political participation, Solon opened a path toward broader inclusion that later reformers could expand. His principle that ordinary citizens should have a role in governance and legal proceedings challenged millennia of hierarchical political organization and pointed toward more egalitarian forms of government.

Admirers of Solon emphasize his moral courage and integrity in refusing to establish himself as tyrant despite having the power and opportunity to do so.[^77] His voluntary surrender of extraordinary authority and his self-imposed exile to prevent modification of his laws demonstrate a commitment to constitutional governance and the rule of law over personal power—qualities that have made him an enduring exemplar of civic virtue.

Contemporary classical scholars appreciate Solon's sophisticated understanding of social dynamics and his recognition that sustainable reform requires balancing competing interests rather than imposing one faction's will on another.[^78] His middle course, though satisfying neither extreme, may have been the only approach capable of preventing violent revolution or tyrannical reaction. From this perspective, the fact that Athens eventually developed democracy rather than descending into permanent oligarchy or tyranny vindicates Solon's moderate approach.

Historians of law and legal systems credit Solon with establishing principles—public prosecution, judicial appeal, written and publicly displayed law—that became foundational to Western legal traditions.[^79] His replacement of Draco's harsh code with more humane laws represents an early recognition that legal systems should serve justice rather than merely maintain order through fear.

### Negative Views

Critics of Solon, both ancient and modern, point to the short-term failure of his reforms to achieve political stability.[^80] Within decades of his legislative program, Athens experienced renewed factional strife and eventually fell under tyranny—precisely the outcome Solon had worked to prevent. From this perspective, his reforms merely postponed rather than resolved Athens' fundamental political conflicts, and his decision to leave the city at a critical moment represents a failure of political leadership.

Some historians argue that Solon's reforms were fundamentally conservative, preserving aristocratic privilege and economic inequality rather than genuinely democratizing Athens.[^81] By maintaining a property-based hierarchy and refusing to redistribute land, Solon ensured that wealth remained concentrated in the hands of a minority. His system still excluded the poorest citizens from holding office, limiting their political power. From this viewpoint, Solon's reforms represented an elite accommodation to popular pressure rather than a principled commitment to equality or democracy.

Marxist and economically-oriented historians sometimes characterize the *seisachtheia* as a measure designed primarily to benefit middle-class debtors and commercial interests rather than the poorest Athenians.[^82] The cancellation of debts helped those who had fallen into debt but still owned property, while doing nothing for those who had never owned land. The refusal to redistribute property meant that fundamental economic inequalities persisted, limiting the practical impact of expanded political rights for the poor.

Critics note that the ambiguity and vagueness of Solon's laws, as Aristotle observed, created practical problems in legal administration and may have reflected confused thinking or insufficient attention to detail.[^83] The fact that his legal code required subsequent revision and clarification suggests it was not the perfected system that tradition sometimes portrays.

Some scholars question whether Solon deserves credit for "founding democracy" when the Athenian system he created was still fundamentally aristocratic or oligarchic, with power concentrated among the wealthy.[^84] They argue that later reformers like Cleisthenes and Ephialtes made the truly revolutionary changes that created democracy, while Solon merely made modest adjustments to aristocratic governance. From this perspective, Solon's reputation as democracy's founder is a later idealization rather than historical reality.

Skeptical historians emphasize the uncertainty surrounding what Solon actually did, noting that our sources are late, heavily mythologized, and potentially unreliable.[^85] The historical Solon may have been considerably less brilliant and his reforms less revolutionary than tradition suggests. The poems attributed to him may be forgeries or later compositions, and the details of his constitutional arrangements may be back-projections from later democratic institutions rather than Solon's actual innovations.

Finally, some critics argue that Solon's self-imposed exile, while intended to preserve his laws, actually represented a abdication of responsibility and abandonment of Athens when his leadership was most needed.[^86] Rather than remaining to defend and explain his reforms, to mediate between factions, and to guide implementation, he left the city to manage the difficult transition without him—a decision that may have contributed to the subsequent political instability.
