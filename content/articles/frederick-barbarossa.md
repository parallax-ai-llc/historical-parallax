## Summary

Frederick I, known as Barbarossa (meaning "Red Beard" in Italian), was Holy Roman Emperor from 1155 until his death in 1190.[^1] Born in December 1122 to the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties, he united Germany's two most powerful families and became one of medieval Europe's most ambitious rulers.[^2] His reign was marked by relentless Italian campaigns against the Lombard League, conflicts with Pope Alexander III, and ultimately his death by drowning during the Third Crusade.[^3] He is remembered both as a brilliant diplomat and administrator who established the concept of the sacrum imperium ("Holy Empire"), and as a ruler whose grand ambitions often exceeded his ability to achieve them.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Frederick was born in mid-December 1122 in Hagenau, part of the Duchy of Swabia in the Holy Roman Empire.[^5] His father, Duke Frederick II of Swabia, belonged to the powerful Hohenstaufen dynasty, while his mother, Judith of Bavaria, came from the rival House of Welf.[^6] This dual heritage made Frederick uniquely positioned to bridge the factional divides that had plagued the German kingdom for generations. His contemporaries believed that because he united in himself the blood of the Welfs and the Hohenstaufen, he would solve the internal problems of the kingdom.[^7]

Frederick's ancestry extended beyond these two great houses. Through his paternal grandmother Agnes, daughter of Emperor Henry IV and Bertha of Savoy, he descended from the Salian dynasty.[^8] Through his mother Judith, he traced lineage to the Ottonian dynasty, connecting him to Emperor Otto II and his Byzantine wife Theophanu.[^9] This rich imperial heritage shaped Frederick's conception of his role as a divinely-appointed ruler destined to restore the empire's former glory.

Barbarossa's early life was one of luxury and privilege, with a settled upbringing in a string of opulent residences and lodges.[^10] He received education in letters appropriate to his station, combined with rigorous military training that would serve him throughout his life. His mother Judith died in 1130, and his father passed away in 1147, making the 25-year-old Frederick Duke of Swabia just weeks before he departed on crusade.[^11]

The nickname "Barbarossa" was not used during his lifetime but was first employed by the Florentines only in 1298, though contemporary sources described his beard as reddish.[^12] The name has since become inseparable from his historical identity, symbolizing both his distinctive appearance and his fierce determination in pursuing his imperial ambitions.

---

## Rise to Power

Frederick's path to the imperial throne began with his participation in the Second Crusade alongside his uncle, Emperor Conrad III, in 1147-1148.[^13] Though the crusade itself ended in disaster, Frederick distinguished himself in battle, particularly at Dorylaeum where he fought excellently despite a devastating Turkish ambush.[^14] At the Siege of Damascus in July 1148, Gilbert of Mons recorded that Frederick "prevailed in arms before all others," demonstrating the military prowess that would define his reign.[^15]

This military experience, combined with his diplomatic skills, led Conrad III to designate Frederick as his successor over his own son when the emperor lay on his deathbed in February 1152.[^16] On March 4, 1152, Frederick was elected King of Germany in Frankfurt, benefiting from the widespread hope that his dual Welf-Hohenstaufen heritage would bring peace to the fractured realm.[^17] Five days later, on March 9, 1152, he was crowned at Aachen, seated on the throne of Charlemagne, by Arnold, the archbishop of Cologne.[^18]

Frederick moved swiftly to consolidate his position by confirming his Welf cousin Henry the Lion as Duke of Saxony and granting him the Duchy of Bavaria as well.[^19] This generous treatment of his powerful cousin would later prove problematic, but initially it secured the support of the Welf faction and allowed Frederick to focus on his Italian ambitions.

In 1154-1155, Frederick launched his first campaign into Italy, aiming to assert his authority over the wealthy northern Italian cities and secure his imperial coronation.[^20] He was crowned King of Italy on April 24, 1155, in Pavia.[^21] On June 18, 1155, Pope Adrian IV crowned Frederick Holy Roman Emperor at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, though the ceremony was marred by violent riots in which Frederick's troops killed over 1,000 Romans and injured thousands more.[^22] Frederick literally spent his coronation day putting down the revolt, a portent of the violent struggles that would characterize his relationship with Italy.

## Major Achievements

### The Diet of Roncaglia and Legal Reforms

One of Frederick's most significant accomplishments was the establishment of a comprehensive legal framework for imperial authority at the Diet of Roncaglia, held between November 11 and 26, 1158.[^23] Following his siege and conquest of Milan, Frederick assembled four jurists from the University of Bologna, founded in 1088 and home to Europe's preeminent law school, to define imperial rights (regalia) with precision.[^24]

The lawyers' decision favored the emperor, judging that his rule was by divine right and restoring imperial rights that would bring the empire an estimated 30,000 pounds of silver per year.[^25] Frederick's contributions to Central European society and culture include the re-establishment of the Corpus Juris Civilis, or the Roman rule of law, which counterbalanced the papal power that had dominated the German states since the Investiture Controversy.[^26] He considered himself the heir of the caesars and had no difficulty including his own legislation with that of Justinian and the emperors of antiquity.[^27]

At Roncaglia, Frederick undertook to appoint imperial officials (podestà) in the North Italian cities, attempting to restore strong imperial suzerainty over municipalities that had won considerable independence during earlier periods of weakness.[^28] Though the Lombard cities would not accept this verdict and it had to be enforced by war, the Diet represented a sophisticated attempt to create systematic financial administration and centralized legal bureaucracy.[^29]

### The Sacrum Imperium

Frederick fundamentally transformed the ideological basis of the empire by introducing the concept of the sacrum imperium, or "Holy Empire."[^30] The phrase first appears in imperial documents in 1157, and Frederick believed himself to have been chosen by God to foster an institution that was the cornerstone of world order, the source of peace and justice.[^31] According to recent scholarship, Frederick Barbarossa and his chancellor Rainald of Dassel strove to resacralize the state and regain the Empire's former pre-eminence in its conflicts with the papacy, the Lombard communes, and the city of Rome.[^32]

This vision of sacral kingship, enhanced by Roman law and the Byzantine imperial model, represented Frederick's attempt to create a divinely-sanctioned universal monarchy.[^33] The phrase later developed into the full title "Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation," shaping European political thought for centuries.[^34]

### Territorial Expansion and Administration

Frederick successfully expanded imperial territories through both military conquest and strategic marriage alliances. On June 9, 1156, at Würzburg, he married Beatrice of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Renaud III, adding the sizeable County of Burgundy to his possessions.[^35] He was formally crowned King of Burgundy at Arles on June 30, 1178, consolidating his control over this strategically important region.[^36]

In Germany, Frederick issued the Großer Reichslandfrieden (Great Imperial Peace), attempting to displace armed feudal conflicts into a system of centrally-administered courts.[^37] He experimented with creating systematic financial administration and a class of imperial officials to govern imperial cities.[^38] Though he lacked a fixed capital and faced constant uncertainty regarding income, his administrative innovations laid groundwork for future imperial governance.

### Diplomatic Achievements

Frederick I Barbarossa was noted for being "far more successful in diplomatic victories than military ones," being "resourceful enough to leverage fissures among his opponents and to free himself from the consequences of serious setbacks."[^39] His alliances with powerful kingdoms such as Hungary and Byzantium showcased his diplomatic acumen.[^40] Most significantly, his successful arrangement of the marriage between his son Henry VI and Constance of Sicily represented a major diplomatic triumph, uniting once-hostile forces and opening new possibilities for imperial expansion.[^41]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Destruction of Italian Cities

Frederick's Italian campaigns were marked by extreme brutality that shocked contemporaries and has been criticized by modern historians. In 1159-1160, he besieged Crema, building and attacking with two massive siege towers before the city surrendered, after which he razed everything from its walls to its churches.[^42] Even more devastating was his treatment of Milan. After a nine-month siege, Milan surrendered on March 1, 1162, and Frederick ordered the city's fortifications razed, its churches destroyed, and its entire population dispersed into the surrounding countryside.[^43]

The war in Lombardy, as historian John Freed shows, was fought with unmitigated violence.[^44] Historian Johannes Laudage especially criticized the pure force approach Frederick employed against Milan, which ultimately doomed the enterprise.[^45] When Emperor Conrad sent his nephew Frederick to "strengthen the condition of the empire" upon their return from the Second Crusade, Frederick executed some of his ministers by hanging them—a tyrannical act rationalized by his court chronicler Otto of Freising as necessary for peace.[^46]

### The Papal Schism and Conflict with Alexander III

The contest between Frederick Barbarossa and Pope Alexander III lasted from 1160 to 1177, the longest struggle between the same emperor and the same pope in medieval history.[^47] The conflict's origins lay in the Diet of Besançon in 1157, where papal legate Orlando Bandinelli (later Pope Alexander III) stated that Rome would grant Frederick "even greater beneficia," using a term meaning both "benefit" and "fief," implying the Emperor's potential subservience to the Pope.[^48] This nearly resulted in the legate's death and marked the rupture between Frederick and the Papacy.

When Pope Adrian IV died in 1159, Frederick openly supported the antipope Victor IV against the legitimately elected Alexander III.[^49] At the Synod of Pavia, Frederick declared for Victor, and in 1165 took a solemn oath at Würzburg never to acknowledge Alexander or any pope elected by his party.[^50] This schism divided Christendom for nearly two decades and ultimately contributed to Frederick's military failures in Italy, as Alexander III supported the Lombard League against imperial forces.

### The Betrayal of Henry the Lion

Frederick's relationship with his cousin Henry the Lion demonstrates both his political ruthlessness and his inability to maintain essential alliances. After initially promoting Henry generously by granting him both Saxony and Bavaria, Frederick found himself dependent on Henry's military support for his Italian campaigns.[^51] In 1176, when Frederick desperately needed reinforcements against the Lombard League, Henry the Lion refused to provide military assistance unless Frederick surrendered the important imperial city of Goslar with its valuable silver mines.[^52]

Frederick's refusal and Henry's subsequent betrayal led directly to the catastrophic defeat at Legnano.[^53] Frederick never forgave this abandonment, and taking advantage of the hostility of other German princes toward Henry, he had Henry tried in absentia by a court of bishops and princes in 1180.[^54] Declaring that imperial law overruled traditional German law, Frederick stripped Henry of his lands and declared him an outlaw, forcing Henry into three years of exile.[^55] While this demonstrated Frederick's authority, it also revealed the fragility of the political order he had attempted to construct.

### Military Failures

Despite his reputation as a warrior, Frederick suffered significant military defeats. When the northern Italian cities inflicted a defeat on Frederick at Alessandria in 1175, the European world was shocked.[^56] Far more devastating was the Battle of Legnano on May 29, 1176, where Frederick's forces were routed by the Lombard League.[^57] The emperor's horse was reportedly brought down during the battle, leading to widespread belief that he had been killed and causing his troops to flee in panic.[^58] This defeat was particularly humiliating because Duke Henry the Lion's refusal to come to his aid made it preventable.[^59]

---

## Personal Life

Frederick's first marriage to Adelheid of Vohburg produced no children and was annulled.[^60] His second marriage to Beatrice of Burgundy, celebrated on June 9, 1156, at Würzburg, proved both politically advantageous and personally fulfilling.[^61] Beatrice was approximately thirteen years old when she married the German king and Roman Emperor, bringing significant political advantages through her inheritance of the County of Burgundy.[^62]

The marriage produced numerous children, establishing a strong Hohenstaufen dynasty. Their most reliably documented children include Beatrice (born late 1162/early 1163), Frederick V, Duke of Swabia (born July 16, 1164, died November 28, 1170), Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (born November 1165, died September 28, 1197), Conrad (born February 1167, died January 20, 1191), later renamed Frederick VI after his older brother's death, and Judith (born October/November 1168, died late 1184).[^63] Additional children included Otto, Count Palatine, and Philip of Swabia (c. 1176–1208), who became Holy Roman Emperor from 1198–1208.[^64]

Beatrice was not merely a dynastic partner but an active political figure. She accompanied Frederick on his travels and campaigns across his empire, and during the Siege of Crema in July 1159, she provided the emperor with badly needed reinforcements from her own County of Burgundy.[^65] Their relationship lasted until Beatrice's death on November 15, 1184, six years before Frederick's own death.[^66]

Frederick possessed qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen, and his political perspicacity.[^67] He combined intellectual sophistication—commissioning his uncle Otto of Freising to write an official biography and engaging deeply with Roman legal theory—with the martial prowess expected of a medieval warrior-king.[^68]

## Legacy

### The Sleeping Emperor Legend

Perhaps no aspect of Frederick's legacy is more powerful than the Kyffhäuser legend, which transformed him into a symbol of German national hopes. According to the legend, Emperor Frederick I does not truly rest in death but sleeps deep underneath the Kyffhäuser, a range of hills in the central German region of Thuringia, awaiting his country's time of need.[^69] He sits motionless at a stone table, and his beard has supposedly grown so long over the centuries that it grew through the table.[^70]

As in the similar legend of King Arthur, Barbarossa supposedly awaits Germany's hour of greatest need, when he will emerge once again.[^71] According to the legends, ravens circling Kyffhäuser are a sign of Barbarossa's continuing presence under the hills, and when the ravens cease to fly around the mountain, he will awake and restore Germany to its ancient greatness.[^72] The Barbarossa myth was first documented in the late 17th century and later popularized by the Brothers Grimm and a poem written in 1817 by Friedrich Rückert.[^73] Interestingly, up to the 16th century, not Barbarossa but Emperor Frederick II assumed the role of the sleeping emperor in the legend.[^74]

### Impact on German Nationalism

Frederick Barbarossa became deeply intertwined with German nationalist mythology and identity, particularly in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The sense of nationhood developed under Frederick eventually inspired reestablishment of a unified Germany in the nineteenth century.[^75] His legacy persisted in German folklore, suggesting he would one day return to restore the empire, reflecting his lasting impact on German nationalism and identity.[^76]

In the 19th and early 20th centuries, Frederick was used as a symbol of German national identity and imperial tradition, invoked by the Wilhelmine regime and other movements seeking a continuity of German greatness.[^77] No medieval German ruler had been pressed into national service as a foil of contemporary hopes and beliefs as often as Barbarossa.[^78] His steadfast opposition to the popes and to Henry the Lion made him the symbol of German unity in the romantic glorification of the 19th century.[^79]

### Medieval Political Legacy

Frederick Barbarossa's reign firmly established the ideal of a united German nation as opposed to a collection of small independent political entities.[^80] However, in spite of Frederick's energy and intelligence, his success in Germany was limited and led to no unified kingdom, as the princes may have been too firmly entrenched because of the weakness of the monarchy during the Investiture Controversy.[^81] Germany developed into a system of territorial states after Barbarossa's death, while France developed into a centralized monarchial state.[^82]

He is remembered as one of the Holy Roman Empire's greatest emperors: uniting the two enemy families of Welf and Hohenstaufen, taking the Empire to a territorial extent it would never again match.[^83] His administrative innovations, legal reforms, and the concept of sacrum imperium shaped European political thought for centuries, even as his actual political achievements proved ephemeral.[^84]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians consider Frederick among the Holy Roman Empire's greatest medieval emperors.[^85] He combined qualities that made him appear almost superhuman to his contemporaries: his longevity, his ambition, his extraordinary skills at organization, his battlefield acumen, and his political perspicacity.[^86] Although Frederick failed to establish lasting political order in the Holy Roman Empire, he is generally considered the most effective of medieval Holy Roman Emperors.[^87]

Notable recent authorities among German-speaking historians include Ferdinand Opll, Johannes Laudage, and Knut Görich. Opll's Friedrich Barbarossa (1990) presents the emperor as a pragmatic leader with a capacity for adaptation and recovery after defeat.[^88] In Italy, scholarly attention toward Frederick's person and his reign is considerable, with notable contributions including Franco Cardini's sympathetic 1985 biography.[^89]

The definitive English-language biography by John B. Freed has been praised as "an erudite and immensely readable biography of Frederick that is very rich in historical detail" and will remain "for generations to come, and rightfully so, the standard work in English on Frederick Barbarossa and Germany in the 12th century."[^90] The scholarly consensus emphasizes Frederick's exceptional abilities as a ruler, his sophisticated understanding of legal and theological concepts supporting imperial authority, and his remarkable capacity to recover from setbacks.[^91]

Frederick I Barbarossa was noted for being "far more successful in diplomatic victories than military ones," being "resourceful enough to leverage fissures among his opponents and to free himself from the consequences of serious setbacks."[^92] His diplomatic efforts, including the negotiation of treaties and alliances with other European powers, helped to secure the borders of the Holy Roman Empire and promote a period of relative peace and stability.[^93]

### Negative Views

Modern historians have increasingly challenged the romanticized view of Barbarossa, pointing to his significant failures and brutal methods. Laudage especially criticized the pure force approach Frederick employed against Milan, which ultimately doomed the enterprise.[^94] The war in Lombardy was fought with unmitigated violence, including the complete destruction of cities and dispersal of populations.[^95]

Critics emphasize that Frederick's grand Italian ambitions consumed enormous resources while achieving little lasting success. When the northern Italian cities inflicted a defeat on Frederick at Alessandria in 1175, the European world was shocked, revealing the limits of imperial power.[^96] The Battle of Legnano in 1176 resulted in complete failure of his fifth Italian campaign, forcing him to negotiate from a position of weakness.[^97]

The most important result of the Peace of Venice (1177) was the failure of the emperor to establish his supremacy over the pope; in acknowledging the complete equality of Alexander III, Frederick confessed the defeat of his imperial pretensions.[^98] Similarly, the Peace of Constance (1183) granted the Lombard cities nearly complete autonomy, representing imperial submission to rebellious subjects.[^99]

Some historians question whether Frederick should be judged a failure, noting that it is erroneous to compare him directly to contemporary monarchs like Philip Augustus and Henry II, as he had different goals.[^100] Modern historians generally reject nationalist myths while portraying the emperor as an influential ruler who suffered many setbacks but often managed to recover.[^101] In his own aims, Frederick may not have achieved them all, especially in Italy, but his successes in Germany and against the Papacy mean he was not a total failure.[^102]

## Famous Quotes

> "Since by the ordination of God I both am called and am Emperor of the Romans, in nothing but name shall I appear to be ruler if the control of the Roman city be wrested from my hands."[^103]

This quote reveals Frederick's conception of imperial authority as divinely ordained and his determination to maintain actual power over Rome, not merely nominal title.

> "It is not for the people to give laws to the prince, but to obey his mandate."[^104]

This statement reflects Frederick's authoritarian understanding of imperial rule, grounded in Roman law principles that placed the emperor above popular will.

> "On Earth, God has placed no more than two powers, and as there is in Heaven but one God, so is there here one Pope and one Emperor."[^105]

This quote articulates Frederick's vision of dual authority—spiritual and temporal—while asserting the emperor's equal standing with the pope, a claim that would fuel his decades-long conflict with the papacy.

> "The lord emperor Frederick, according as he has received the lord pope Alexander as catholic and universal pope, so he will exhibit to him due reverence, just as his, Frederick's, catholic predecessors have exhibited it to his, Alexander's, catholic predecessors."[^106]

From the Peace of Venice (1177), this quote demonstrates Frederick's eventual acceptance of papal authority after years of supporting antipopes, representing a significant political defeat masked in diplomatic language.
