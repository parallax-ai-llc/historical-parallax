## Summary

Sun Tzu (c. 544-496 BCE) was a Chinese military strategist, philosopher, and general traditionally credited as the author of *The Art of War*, the most influential treatise on military strategy ever written. His principles—"know your enemy and know yourself," "supreme excellence is subduing the enemy without fighting"—transcend warfare to apply to business, politics, sports, and conflict of any kind. Though historical details are uncertain, the text attributed to Sun Tzu has been studied by military leaders from ancient China to Napoleon to modern business executives. The Art of War remains required reading at military academies worldwide.
