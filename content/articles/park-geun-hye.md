## Summary

Park Geun-hye served as the 11th president of South Korea from 2013 to 2017, becoming the first woman elected head of state in South Korea and East Asia.[^1] The daughter of former dictator Park Chung-hee, she served as South Korea's first lady from 1974 to 1979 after her mother's assassination.[^2] Her presidency, which began with promises of economic revival and reconciliation, ended in historic disgrace when she became the first democratically elected South Korean president to be impeached and removed from office due to a massive corruption scandal involving her confidante Choi Soon-sil.[^3] After serving nearly five years in prison, she was pardoned in 2021 on compassionate grounds.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Park Geun-hye was born on February 2, 1952, in Samdeok-dong of Jung District, Daegu, South Korea, as the first child of Park Chung-hee and Yuk Young-soo.[^5] Her father came to power through the May 16 military coup d'état of 1961 and served as the third president of South Korea from 1963 to 1979, presiding over a period of rapid economic development alongside authoritarian rule.[^6] The family moved to Seoul in 1953, where Park spent her formative years in the presidential Blue House.[^7]

Despite her privileged background, Park's mother made efforts to provide her with a relatively normal childhood, sending her to public schools and allowing her to use public transportation like other children.[^8] Park graduated from Jangchung Elementary School and attended the prestigious Sungshim (Sacred Heart) Girls' Middle and High School, completing her secondary education in 1970.[^9] She pursued higher education at Sogang University, one of South Korea's elite institutions, where she earned a Bachelor of Science degree in electronic engineering in 1974—an unusual field for women at that time.[^10]

Park's educational trajectory was interrupted by family tragedy. She had begun graduate studies at Grenoble University in France when, on August 15, 1974, a North Korean sympathizer named Mun Se-gwang attempted to assassinate her father during an Independence Day ceremony at the Seoul National Theater.[^11] The fourth bullet struck her mother Yuk Young-soo in the head, killing the first lady.[^12] At age 22, Park was forced to abandon her studies and return to South Korea to assume the role of first lady, a position she would hold for the next five years.[^13]

Park has a younger sister, Park Geun-ryeong, a younger brother, Park Ji-man, and an older half-sister, Park Jae-ok.[^14] She never married and has no children, a fact that would later become central to her political persona as someone fully devoted to serving the nation.[^15] Her family background would prove to be both an asset and a liability throughout her political career—while her father's legacy as the architect of South Korea's "economic miracle" garnered support from conservatives, his authoritarian rule made her a controversial figure among progressives and younger voters.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Park Geun-hye's path to the presidency was marked by personal tragedy, political resilience, and a complex relationship with her father's legacy. After serving as first lady from 1974 to 1979, her father was assassinated on October 26, 1979, by Kim Jae-gyu, the director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA).[^17] Notably, Kim Jae-gyu later testified that one of his motives for killing President Park Chung-hee was his concern over the influence that Choi Tae-min, a cult leader, was exerting over Park Geun-hye and, by extension, the president.[^18]

Following the double trauma of losing both parents to assassination, Park retreated from public life for nearly two decades, living a reclusive existence.[^19] During this period, her relationship with Choi Tae-min's family, particularly his daughter Choi Soon-sil, continued—a connection that began in 1974 when Choi Tae-min, leader of the Church of Eternal Life cult, approached the grieving Park claiming her deceased mother had appeared to him in dreams.[^20] Even Park's siblings expressed concerns about this relationship, with her younger sister and brother filing a petition in 1990 warning that Choi was manipulating her.[^21]

Park entered politics in 1998, winning a parliamentary seat and beginning four consecutive terms in the National Assembly from 1998 to 2012.[^22] Her political career accelerated when she assumed leadership of the Grand National Party (GNP) in 2004 during a crisis period for the conservatives.[^23] The party was facing potential defeat in the 2004 general election due to a failed attempt to impeach President Roh Moo-hyun and a bribery scandal.[^24] Under Park's leadership, the GNP managed to win 121 seats—considered a remarkable achievement under difficult circumstances—earning her the nickname "queen of elections."[^25]

Her reputation as an electoral asset grew when, as GNP chairwoman, she led the party to significant gains in local elections and secured a majority in 2006.[^26] In 2006, Park survived a physical attack when a man wielding a box cutter slashed her face while she was campaigning, leaving a scar that became a symbol of her political toughness.[^27] In 2011, as the party's approval ratings declined, the GNP formed an emergency committee and rebranded itself as the Saenuri Party ("New Frontier Party"), with Park appointed as chairwoman on December 19, 2011.[^28]

The 2012 general election proved pivotal to Park's presidential ambitions. During the 13-day campaign period, she traveled approximately 7,200 kilometers around South Korea, visiting more than 100 constituencies.[^29] The Saenuri Party achieved a surprise victory against the opposing Democratic United Party, winning 152 seats and retaining its majority position.[^30] Korean news media and political experts credited Park's leadership as the most important factor in the party's success.[^31]

On December 19, 2012, Park won South Korea's presidential election with 51.6% of the vote, defeating Moon Jae-in of the Democratic United Party, who received 48.0%.[^32] Park's vote share was the highest won by any candidate since the beginning of free and fair direct elections in 1987 and marked the first time since democratization that a candidate won an outright majority.[^33] Despite sub-freezing temperatures, voter turnout reached 76 percent, surpassing the two previous presidential elections.[^34] Park drew strong support from older Koreans in their 50s and 60s who remembered her father's era, while Moon appealed more to younger voters.[^35]

## Major Achievements

Park Geun-hye's presidency began with an ambitious vision encapsulated in the phrase "a new era of hope and happiness," built on five pillars: a jobs-centered creative economy, tailored employment and welfare, creativity-oriented education and cultural enrichment, a safe and united society, and strong security measures for sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula.[^36] Her inauguration on February 25, 2013, made her not only South Korea's first female president but also the first woman elected head of state in East Asia—a historic milestone for the region.[^37]

### Economic Initiatives

Central to Park's domestic agenda was the concept of a "creative economy," which she defined as the convergence of science and technology with industry, the fusion of culture with industry, and the cultivation of creativity across traditional boundaries.[^38] At the heart of this vision were science, technology, and the IT industry, which Park identified as key national priorities.[^39] She established the Ministry of Future Planning and Science to spearhead this new paradigm, designed to meld science, technology, and IT industries into a cohesive innovation ecosystem.[^40]

Park promised "compassionate growth" that would reinvigorate 5 percent annual growth while reducing inequality and raising employment levels.[^41] She vowed to revive the domestic economy through a dual focus on "creative economy" and "economic democratization," proclaiming her commitment to achieving the "happiness" of South Korean citizens by establishing a fair society and sound welfare system.[^42] Economic democratization, in Park's vision, meant rebalancing the country's economy by redistributing wealth and curbing the excessive power of the chaebols (family-controlled conglomerates).[^43]

The Park administration worked to build what it called a "principled market economy" where conglomerates and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) would share resources, creating a "ladder of hope" that would allow SMEs to grow into medium-sized enterprises and eventually into global companies.[^44] However, facing South Korea's sluggish economic growth in 2012, Park prioritized economic recovery over immediate chaebol regulation, viewing economic democratization as a medium- to long-term goal rather than an immediate priority.[^45]

### Foreign Policy

In foreign policy, Park was expected to continue many of her predecessor Lee Myung-bak's policies toward the United States while pursuing a strengthened bilateral relationship.[^46] She facilitated implementation of the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA), maintaining the close alliance that has been central to South Korean security since the Korean War.[^47] During her campaign, Park introduced the concept of "trustpolitik"—building a relationship with North Korea based on trust rather than confrontation alone.[^48]

Park's approach to North Korea balanced firmness on security with openness to humanitarian assistance, indicating that Seoul was not opposed to providing basic fertilizer and food aid to help the North Korean people.[^49] In March 2014, she delivered a significant speech in Dresden, Germany, titled "An Initiative for Peaceful Unification on the Korean Peninsula," outlining her vision for eventual reunification.[^50] On the contentious issue of historical relations with Japan, Park took a firm stance, stating: "Historians in Japan as well as historians across the world have been calling on the Japanese leadership to come clean about what they have done in the past so we can move forward."[^51]

### Historic Significance

Beyond specific policies, Park's election itself represented a significant achievement for gender equality in a traditionally patriarchal society. Her victory demonstrated that a woman could reach the highest political office in South Korea, though scholarly research later found that ideological affinity played a more significant role than gender in voters' evaluation of her presidency, and there was limited evidence that women voters felt more represented after her election.[^52] Nevertheless, her presidency broke a significant barrier in East Asian politics and inspired discussions about women's leadership across the region.[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Park Geun-hye's presidency was marred by serious controversies that ultimately led to her downfall, with the Sewol ferry disaster and the Choi Soon-sil corruption scandal standing as the two most catastrophic failures of her administration.

### The Sewol Ferry Disaster

On April 16, 2014, the ferry MV Sewol sank off the coast of South Korea, killing 304 out of 476 passengers and crew, including approximately 250 students from Danwon High School in Ansan—about 82% of the casualties were children.[^54] The disaster became South Korea's worst since the 1995 Sampoong department store collapse and caused massive political fallout for Park's government, which was viewed as bearing responsibility for the inadequate response.[^55]

Witness reports and investigations raised disturbing questions about Park's whereabouts and actions during the critical hours of the disaster. While prosecutors concluded that she was in her bedroom on the morning of the tragedy, it remains unclear what she was actually doing during the crisis.[^56] Some allegations suggested she remained confined to her bedroom when immediate leadership was desperately needed.[^57] The president later acknowledged the failures, stating: "As president, I am the one who holds ultimate responsibility for the inappropriate response to the accident."[^58] On May 18, 2014, Park announced plans to disband the Coast Guard after its failure to respond effectively to the disaster.[^59]

Prior to the revelation of the corruption scandal, the Sewol ferry disaster was the most significant event contributing to public disillusionment with Park's leadership and would eventually help reach a tipping point for the impeachment movement that followed in 2017.[^60]

### The Choi Soon-sil Corruption Scandal

The scandal that destroyed Park's presidency erupted in October 2016, revealing the extraordinary influence wielded by Choi Soon-sil, the daughter of cult leader Choi Tae-min, over the president and government affairs.[^61] Revelations emerged that Choi, who held no official government position, had used her relationship with Park to seek donations from major business conglomerates (chaebols) including Samsung, Hyundai, SK Group, and Lotte to two foundations she controlled.[^62] Cable channel JTBC's revelation of Choi's tablet PC on October 24, 2016, provided concrete evidence that Choi had directly influenced and interfered with Park government policies and had even edited Park's presidential speeches.[^63]

Despite having no official role, South Korean prosecutors alleged that Choi wielded enormous power, had a say in major policy decisions, and exploited her relationship with the president to bully companies into handing over tens of millions of dollars to businesses and foundations under her control.[^64] The Constitutional Court found that Park had ordered Ahn Jong-bum, the Presidential Policy Advisor, to establish two dubious foundations under Choi's control, extorting more than $69 million from Korean conglomerates.[^65]

### Authoritarian Governance Style

Beyond these specific scandals, Park's governing style drew criticism for its authoritarian tendencies that echoed her father's dictatorship. Critics argued that she did not differentiate between public and private space when exercising power, and that her governing approach remained stuck in the "Yushin dictatorship" era of the 1970s, when her father had abused his authority.[^66] Her opponents and even some supporters criticized her for being reserved, secretive, and aloof—qualities that some interpreted as evidence that she viewed herself as a "political princess" entitled to rule.[^67] Her leadership style reminded many observers of her father's authoritarian approach, though she lacked his political acumen and his ability to maintain effective control.[^68]

---

## Personal Life

Park Geun-hye's personal life has been marked by extraordinary tragedy, unusual relationships, and a solitary existence that distinguished her from most political leaders. She never married and has no children, a fact that became central to her political identity.[^69] In campaign speeches and public addresses, she frequently invoked this reality, declaring: "You, the people, are my only family, and to make you happy is the reason I do politics."[^70] This framing positioned her as someone wholly devoted to national service, unburdened by personal family obligations.

Park is described as an atheist with a Buddhist and Roman Catholic upbringing, reflecting the religious diversity of her parents' backgrounds.[^71] Beyond politics, she is known as a skilled pianist and has performed at various public events, demonstrating an artistic side rarely visible in her reserved public persona.[^72] Those who worked with Park described her as honest, sincere, and hard-working, noting that despite coming from a privileged family, she showed genuine concern for the welfare of less fortunate Koreans.[^73]

However, her personality also included challenging traits that complicated her leadership. Her opponents and supporters alike criticized her for being reserved and secretive, creating a sense of distance between her and the public.[^74] Her aloofness and self-assurance were sometimes interpreted as signs that she viewed herself as inherently entitled to power due to her family lineage.[^75] This perception was reinforced by her governing style, which critics characterized as more authoritarian than collaborative, a tendency seen as the product of both her unique personal background and South Korea's still-maturing democratic institutions.[^76]

The most controversial aspect of Park's personal life was her decades-long relationship with the Choi family. This connection began in the immediate aftermath of her mother's assassination in 1974, when Choi Tae-min—a former Buddhist monk who had established his own religious cult called the Church of Eternal Life, combining elements of Buddhism, Christianity, and traditional Korean shamanism—approached the grieving 22-year-old Park.[^77] Choi claimed that her deceased mother had appeared to him in dreams, asking him to help her daughter.[^78] This calculated manipulation initiated a relationship that would span decades and ultimately destroy Park's presidency.

Choi Tae-min, who married six times and used multiple pseudonyms, maintained influence over Park throughout the 1970s, to the extent that Kim Jae-gyu, the KCIA director who assassinated Park's father in 1979, cited the president's failure to stop Choi's corrupt activities and keep him away from his daughter as one of his motives for the killing.[^79] Even after Choi Tae-min's death, his daughter Choi Soon-sil continued the relationship with Park, a connection that Park's own siblings found deeply troubling—in 1990, Park's younger sister and brother filed a petition with then-President Roh Tae-woo expressing concerns that Choi was manipulating their sister.[^80]

This relationship would prove to be Park's ultimate undoing, as Choi Soon-sil exploited her access to the president to engage in massive corruption, leading directly to Park's impeachment and imprisonment. The relationship revealed Park's profound vulnerability and isolation, suggesting that the traumas of losing both parents to assassination left her susceptible to manipulation by those who claimed to offer spiritual connection to her deceased mother.

## Legacy

Park Geun-hye's legacy is one of dramatic contradictions—historic achievement followed by unprecedented disgrace, pioneering gender barriers while ultimately reinforcing institutional distrust, and promising democratic renewal while governing with authoritarian tendencies. Her story has become inextricably linked to the broader narrative of South Korea's turbulent democratic development and the unresolved tensions surrounding her father's dictatorship.

### The Shadow of Impeachment

On December 9, 2016, Park was impeached by the National Assembly, with 234 members of the 300-member body voting to temporarily suspend her presidential powers and duties.[^81] On March 10, 2017, the Constitutional Court unanimously upheld the impeachment in an 8-0 decision, removing Park from office and making her the first democratically elected South Korean president to be impeached and removed.[^82] The court found that she had abused her power by allowing Choi Soon-sil to interfere in state affairs and by colluding to extort money from major corporations.[^83]

On April 6, 2018, Park was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to 24 years in prison, with a fine of 18 billion won ($17 million)—in an unprecedented move, the verdict was broadcast live on Korean television.[^84] She received an additional 8 years in prison in July 2018, and in August 2018, her total sentence was set at 25 years for the main Choi Soon-sil-related charges.[^85] The spectacle of a former president imprisoned for corruption sent shockwaves through South Korean society and raised questions about accountability for political elites.

### A Divided Nation

Public opinion on Park remains deeply polarized, largely along the same lines that divided South Koreans during her father's era. Park Chung-hee's legacy continues to fracture Korean society decades after his death—he is abhorred by many as a brutal dictator who suppressed human rights and democratic freedoms, yet celebrated by others as the architect of the South Korean "economic miracle" that transformed the nation from postwar poverty to industrial prosperity.[^86] A favorable evaluation of Park Geun-hye's father was one of the key voting factors in the 2012 presidential election, with many supporters viewing Park as a proxy for her father, expecting her to carry on his legacy of strong leadership and economic development.[^87]

While 81% of voters supported impeachment before the National Assembly vote in 2016, attitudes shifted over time.[^88] By January 2021, approximately 37% of voters overall supported granting Park amnesty, and 70% of supporters of her conservative party wanted to see her released from prison.[^89] On December 24, 2021, President Moon Jae-in—the man Park had defeated in the 2012 election—announced that she would receive a special pardon on compassionate grounds, citing her deteriorating health after serving nearly five years in prison.[^90] Justice Minister Park Beom-Kye explained the decision as an effort "to overcome unfortunate past history, realize people's unity and provide a chance to take a new step forward to the future."[^91] Park was released from prison on December 31, 2021.[^92]

### Democratic Institutions Strengthened

Despite the trauma of her presidency, Park's impeachment and conviction demonstrated the resilience of South Korea's democratic institutions. The Constitutional Court's willingness to remove a sitting president, the prosecutorial system's determination to hold her accountable, and the massive peaceful protests that demanded her removal (with estimates of over one million citizens participating at peak moments) all showed that South Korea's democracy had matured significantly since the authoritarian era.[^93] The impeachment proved that no leader, regardless of family legacy or electoral mandate, stood above the law—a crucial principle for any functioning democracy.

### Symbolic Representation and Women's Leadership

Park's presidency raised complex questions about women's political representation and leadership. While she broke a significant gender barrier, scholarly research found that ideological rather than gender affinity played a more significant role in voters' evaluation of her contribution to symbolic representation and women's political empowerment.[^94] Data did not provide strong evidence that women voters felt more represented after the election of the country's first female president, suggesting that descriptive representation alone does not necessarily translate into substantive representation or increased political empowerment for women as a group.[^95]

Her failure in office and the corrupt nature of her relationship with Choi Soon-sil may have actually created barriers for future female leaders, as some critics could point to her presidency as evidence of women's unsuitability for executive leadership—an unfair conclusion, but one that female politicians in South Korea must now contend with.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters of Park Geun-hye and defenders of her legacy emphasize several aspects of her presidency and political career that deserve recognition despite the scandal that ended her time in office.

Park's electoral achievements remain significant. Her leadership of the Grand National Party and later the Saenuri Party demonstrated exceptional political skill—she revived a conservative party in crisis in 2004, led it to victory in 2012, and won the presidency with the highest vote share since democratization began in 1987.[^96] Her ability to connect with older voters and those nostalgic for her father's era of economic growth showed political acumen and an understanding of a significant constituency's concerns.

Her vision of a "creative economy" and "economic democratization," though imperfectly implemented, represented an attempt to address real challenges facing South Korean society: the dominance of chaebols, youth unemployment, and the need for innovation-driven growth.[^97] Supporters argue that given more time and less interference from the Choi Soon-sil scandal, these initiatives might have borne fruit and repositioned South Korea's economy for the 21st century.

Park's commitment to the U.S.-South Korea alliance and her firm stance on security issues, including North Korean provocations, provided stability during a period of regional uncertainty.[^98] Her "trustpolitik" approach to North Korea, which balanced humanitarian concerns with security imperatives, offered a middle path between the hardline policies of some predecessors and the more conciliatory approaches of others.[^99]

Some observers note that Park demonstrated genuine concern for ordinary Koreans and worked long hours, showing personal dedication to public service even if her judgment was catastrophically flawed in some areas.[^100] Her survival of a violent knife attack in 2006 and her willingness to continue in public life demonstrated physical courage, if not always political wisdom.

Finally, defenders argue that Park was treated more harshly than male predecessors who also engaged in corruption, suggesting that gender bias played a role in the severity of her punishment and the intensity of public condemnation—though this argument remains controversial and is rejected by many analysts who point to the unprecedented scale and nature of the Choi Soon-sil scandal.

### Negative Views

Critics of Park Geun-hye present a devastating assessment of her presidency, viewing it as a cautionary tale about dynastic politics, authoritarian tendencies, and the dangers of a leader isolated from democratic accountability.

Scholars and political analysts argue that Park's governing style revealed troubling authoritarian instincts inherited from her father's era. One academic assessment noted that "she did not differentiate between public space and private space when exercising her power, and her governing style remained stuck in the 'Yushin dictatorship' era of the 1970s, when her father abused his power."[^101] This represented a regression from democratic norms rather than their advancement, critics contend.

The Sewol ferry disaster exposed what critics characterize as Park's fundamental incompetence and lack of empathy. Her whereabouts and actions during the critical hours when hundreds of children were drowning remain unclear and troubling.[^102] The disaster revealed a government more concerned with political optics than saving lives, and Park's eventual response—dismantling the Coast Guard rather than addressing deeper institutional failures—showed a preference for scapegoating over systemic reform.[^103]

The Choi Soon-sil scandal revealed not just corruption but a profound failure of presidential judgment and an alarming vulnerability to manipulation. That Park allowed someone with no official position, no security clearance, and no democratic mandate to influence major policy decisions, edit presidential speeches, and extort tens of millions of dollars from major corporations represents an unprecedented abdication of presidential responsibility.[^104] The fact that this relationship originated with a cult leader who manipulated the grieving Park by claiming contact with her deceased mother makes the story even more disturbing and suggests deep psychological issues that should have disqualified her from holding the highest office.[^105]

Critics argue that Park's presidency actually damaged the cause of women's political leadership rather than advancing it. Her dynastic path to power—succeeding based primarily on her father's name rather than her own qualifications—her secretive and authoritarian governing style, and her ultimate failure in corruption reinforced negative stereotypes rather than breaking them.[^106] Research showing that women voters did not feel more represented by Park's presidency suggests she failed to translate descriptive representation into substantive gains for women.[^107]

Historians note that Park's presidency demonstrated the ongoing problems with South Korea's political culture, including the dominance of regional loyalties, the persistence of authoritarian tendencies, and the influence of dynastic politics.[^108] Rather than representing a break with the past, Park's rise and fall showed how the past continues to haunt South Korean democracy, with unresolved questions about her father's legacy directly contributing to her own political trajectory and ultimate failure.

Moon Jae-in's decision to pardon Park, while framed as an act of reconciliation, troubled many Koreans who saw it as letting a corrupt leader escape full accountability for serious crimes.[^109] This raised concerns about whether South Korea's justice system would ever truly hold powerful political figures fully accountable, or whether they would always eventually receive pardons and preferential treatment unavailable to ordinary citizens.
