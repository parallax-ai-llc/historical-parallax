## Summary

Pingala was an ancient Indian mathematician who described binary numbers, Pascal's triangle (Meru Prastara), and the Fibonacci sequence in his treatise on Sanskrit prosody (Chandahshastra) around 200 BC. His work anticipated these mathematical concepts by centuries before their Western 'discovery.' He used binary-like notation to classify Sanskrit meters.
