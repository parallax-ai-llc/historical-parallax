## Summary
John George Haigh, the 'Acid Bath Murderer,' killed at least six people in 1940s England, dissolving their bodies in sulfuric acid to steal their assets. He believed no body meant no conviction. Forensic evidence from acid sludge led to his execution in 1949.

## Early Life
Born July 24, 1909, in Stamford, Lincolnshire. Raised by strict Plymouth Brethren parents. He was a choirboy and skilled forger. Multiple fraud convictions preceded his murders. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1944 and 1949, Haigh murdered six people, dissolving remains in sulfuric acid. He forged documents to control victims' assets. He incorrectly believed the legal principle of corpus delicti required an intact body for conviction. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
After Olive Durand-Deacon disappeared in 1949, forensic scientist Keith Simpson found gallstones, denture fragments, and bone in acid sludge at Haigh's workshop. Convicted and hanged at Wandsworth Prison, August 10, 1949. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

- Led to improved investigation of missing wealthy individuals

## Negative Perspectives
