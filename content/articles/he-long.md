## Summary

He Long (贺龙; March 22, 1896 – June 9, 1969) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and one of the Ten Marshals of the People's Liberation Army. Born into poverty in Sangzhi County, Hunan Province, he rose from outlaw to become one of China's most celebrated military commanders, participating in the Nanchang Uprising, the Long March, and major campaigns against both Japanese invaders and Nationalist forces. Despite his distinguished service, He Long became one of the first senior military leaders purged during the Cultural Revolution, dying in custody in 1969 after prolonged persecution and medical neglect. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1980, restoring his legacy as a founding father of the People's Republic of China.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

He Long was born on March 22, 1896, in Hongjiaguan, Sangzhi County, in the remote mountainous region of northwestern Hunan Province.[^3] A member of the Tujia ethnic minority, one of China's officially recognized ethnic groups concentrated in the Wuling Mountains region, He Long grew up in conditions of extreme poverty despite his father having served as a minor Qing dynasty military officer.[^4][^5] The family's impoverished circumstances prevented him from receiving any formal education, leaving him functionally illiterate in his youth—a disadvantage he would later overcome through self-education during his revolutionary career.[^2][^6]

Sangzhi County, situated at the northwestern fringe of Hunan Province, was home to 28 ethnic groups, primarily comprising minorities of Tujia, Bai, and Miao peoples.[^7] This multicultural environment shaped He Long's early worldview, though the region's remoteness and poverty also bred banditry and local armed resistance to government authority. The young He Long witnessed firsthand the oppression of peasants by landlords and corrupt officials, experiences that would profoundly influence his later revolutionary commitments.[^8]

He Long's revolutionary career began dramatically and violently. After a government tax assessor murdered his uncle, the young He Long sought revenge, attacking the official with a butcher's cleaver in 1914.[^9] This act of vengeance forced him to flee into the mountains, where he became an outlaw and gradually attracted followers, forming a small personal army.[^1][^10] His natural charisma and leadership abilities enabled him to build this force from scratch, beginning with just two kitchen knives and eventually commanding thousands of men.[^11]

During the warlord era that followed the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, He Long's armed band operated in the lawless borderlands between Hunan and Sichuan provinces. His reputation as a Robin Hood-like figure who protected peasants from rapacious officials and warlords grew throughout the region.[^8] By the early 1920s, he had transitioned from outlaw to warlord, commanding significant military forces in western Hunan. This period established his credentials as a military leader and provided him with the tactical experience in guerrilla warfare that would prove invaluable during the revolutionary struggles to come.[^12]

---

## Rise to Power

He Long's transition from warlord to revolutionary began when his forces joined the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) in the early 1920s. In 1923, he was promoted to command the Nationalist Twentieth Army, bringing his guerrilla forces under the banner of Sun Yat-sen's nationalist movement.[^13] During the Northern Expedition of 1926-1927, a military campaign aimed at reunifying China under Nationalist control, He Long commanded the 1st Division, 9th Corps of the National Revolutionary Army, serving under Zhang Fakui.[^14] His forces participated in major battles that extended Kuomintang control northward from their base in Guangdong.[^15]

In late 1926, He Long secretly joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), recruited by Zhou Enlai and other Communist organizers who recognized his military capabilities and sympathy for peasant causes.[^16] This clandestine membership became critical in 1927 when Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek launched a violent purge of Communists within the Kuomintang, massacring thousands in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other cities.[^17] After the collapse of Wang Jingwei's leftist Kuomintang government in Wuhan and Chiang's systematic suppression of Communist Party members, He Long made the fateful decision to openly break with the Nationalists and join the Communist rebellion.[^13][^18]

On August 1, 1927, He Long played a pivotal role in planning and executing the Nanchang Uprising alongside Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and other Communist leaders.[^19] This armed insurrection, though ultimately unsuccessful in holding the city, marked the founding moment of the Chinese Communist Party's independent military forces—what would eventually become the People's Liberation Army.[^20] August 1st is still celebrated as the founding date of the PLA, cementing He Long's position as one of the army's founding fathers.[^21] Following the uprising's failure, He Long retreated with his forces to the countryside, commanding the 20th Corps, 1st Column of the newly formed Red Army.[^18]

Between 1928 and 1934, He Long established and defended Communist base areas in the Hunan-Hubei border region, creating the Hunan-Hubei-Sichuan-Guizhou Soviet.[^22] His forces engaged in constant guerrilla warfare against Nationalist encirclement campaigns, employing hit-and-run tactics and mobilizing peasant support to sustain their operations.[^23] He Long's charismatic leadership style—he was described as a "flamboyant, mustachioed, outgoing man, unable to walk down the street without attracting a crowd"—made him effective at recruiting and maintaining troop morale under difficult conditions.[^9] His reputation as a fine orator helped him articulate Communist ideology to largely illiterate peasant soldiers and civilians.[^24]

## Major Achievements

He Long's most celebrated military achievement was his leadership of the Second Front Army during the Long March, the epic strategic retreat that became central to Communist revolutionary mythology. In November 1935, more than a year after Mao Zedong's First Front Army had been forced to evacuate their Jiangxi Soviet, He Long and his political commissar Ren Bishi led the Second Front Army (comprising the 2nd and 6th Army Corps) westward from their base areas in Hubei province.[^25][^26] This force of approximately 17,000 troops undertook an even more circuitous route than Mao's forces, being driven far to the west through Yunnan province, crossing the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain massif, and traversing the harsh Tibetan highlands of western Sichuan.[^27]

In June 1936, He Long's Second Front Army encountered Zhang Guotao's Fourth Front Army in the Tibetan borderlands.[^28] Zhang, who commanded the largest Communist force at approximately 84,000 troops, attempted to assert his authority over the Communist movement and advocated a southward march strategy.[^29] Both He Long and Ren Bishi strongly disagreed with Zhang's strategic direction and his challenge to Mao Zedong's leadership of the Party.[^30] Demonstrating both political acumen and loyalty to the Party center, He Long refused to submit to Zhang's authority and instead led his forces northward to join Mao's headquarters in Shaanxi province by the end of 1936.[^31] This decision proved crucial: Zhang's forces, which did march south, were largely destroyed by Nationalist and Muslim warlord armies, while He Long's Second Front Army arrived in Yan'an substantially intact—one of the few Communist formations to complete the Long March with its organization and fighting capacity preserved.[^32]

Because He Long's forces arrived in Yan'an relatively unscathed, they assumed critical responsibility for defending the new Communist capital and the Party leadership.[^33] During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), He Long commanded the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army, with Xiao Ke serving as deputy commander.[^34] The 120th Division, numbering approximately 15,000 soldiers, was one of three main divisions of the Eighth Route Army formed through cooperation with the Kuomintang to resist Japanese invasion.[^35] Operating primarily in northwestern Shanxi province, He Long's forces moved behind Japanese lines to establish anti-Japanese base areas and wage guerrilla warfare against the invaders.[^36]

During the Hundred Regiments Offensive of 1940, the largest coordinated Communist military operation against Japanese forces, He Long's 120th Division played a crucial role in disrupting the Datong-Puzhou Railway, preventing Japanese reinforcements from being deployed against other Communist forces.[^37][^38] The division launched major attacks on the northern section of the railway and main roads in northwestern Shanxi, temporarily paralyzing Japanese logistics in the region.[^39] Throughout the war, He Long demonstrated exceptional skill in guerrilla warfare tactics, expanding Communist-controlled territory behind enemy lines and mobilizing peasant populations to support the resistance.[^40]

Following Japan's surrender in 1945, He Long's forces were reorganized as part of the Communist forces preparing for renewed civil war with the Nationalists. By the end of 1945, he commanded approximately 170,000 troops, which were placed under the overall command of Peng Dehuai as the Northwest Field Army.[^41][^42] He Long served as political commissar alongside Peng Dehuai as commander, directing political and organizational efforts in the northwest theater from 1946 to 1949.[^43] Though operating with the most poorly equipped forces among Communist field armies, the Northwest Field Army successfully defended the Yan'an base area against much larger Nationalist armies under Hu Zongnan, eventually going on the offensive to occupy Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces by September 1949.[^44][^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revolutionary credentials, He Long's early career as a bandit and warlord left an ambiguous legacy. His forces during the warlord period engaged in activities typical of such armies, including taxation of local populations and military requisitions that sometimes differed little from banditry.[^46] Critics within the Communist Party occasionally questioned whether his motivations for joining the revolution were ideological or opportunistic, though these doubts were generally dismissed given his consistent loyalty after 1927.[^47]

During the establishment of Communist base areas in the early 1930s, He Long's forces participated in land reform campaigns that sometimes involved violence against landlords and "class enemies."[^48] While such actions were considered necessary revolutionary measures within Communist ideology, they resulted in significant loss of life and the confiscation of property from entire social classes. The agrarian policies implemented in areas under his control, including forced collectivization, caused hardship for some peasant populations even as they benefited others.[^49]

He Long's relationship with military rivals sometimes created tensions within the Communist leadership. His opposition to Mao Zedong's 1959 purge of Peng Dehuai, who had criticized Mao's Great Leap Forward policies at the Lushan Conference, demonstrated independence of thought that would later be held against him.[^50] Though He Long attempted to rehabilitate Peng, his efforts failed, and this stance was remembered by Mao's supporters as evidence of disloyalty to the Chairman.[^51]

The most devastating controversy of He Long's life came during the Cultural Revolution launched in 1966. Lin Biao, then Mao's designated successor and Minister of Defense, orchestrated a campaign of false accusations against He Long.[^52] He was charged with secretly deploying troops to stage a mutiny, constructing pillboxes for counter-revolutionary purposes, and harboring personal ambitions as a "big warlord" or "biggest bandit" disloyal to the Party.[^53] These fabricated charges drew on negative stereotypes from his warlord past to paint him as a threat to Mao's authority.[^54]

In January 1967, He Long was placed under house arrest in Beijing, becoming one of the first senior PLA leaders purged during the Cultural Revolution.[^55] He was the second highest-ranking member of the Military Affairs Commission at the time of his purge, and the method used against him—isolation, denunciation, and gradual destruction through denial of medical care—set a pattern for subsequent purges of military leadership throughout the Cultural Revolution.[^56] The brutality of his persecution, which he described as "intended to destroy my health so that they can murder me without spilling my blood," revealed the extreme paranoia and cruelty of the period.[^57]

---

## Personal Life

He Long's personal life was marked by tragedy and resilience amidst decades of warfare and political upheaval. He was married multiple times, with his earlier marriages ending due to the violent conflicts that characterized his revolutionary career. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces killed approximately 100 of He Long's relatives, including three sisters and his brother, in retaliation for his Communist activities—a devastating toll that exemplified the personal costs of China's civil war.[^58]

His fourth wife was Jian Xianren (简先任), whom he married when she was 20 years old.[^59] On November 1, 1935, during the Long March, Jian Xianren gave birth to a daughter. Because the child was born immediately after a military victory, He Long named her "Jiesheng" (捷生), meaning "born after a victory."[^60] Just 19 days later, the infant Jiesheng was strapped into a cradle on a mule and embarked on the Long March, becoming the youngest participant in that epic journey.[^61] Despite the extraordinary hardships—hunger, disease, combat, and harsh weather—both mother and daughter survived. He Jiesheng later wrote in a 2013 book about the experience: "It is a miracle that I could survive the path full of dangers and also full of promises in the one-year Long March."[^62]

He Long was later separated from Jian Xianren and married his fifth wife, Xue Ming (薛明), with whom he spent 27 years until his death.[^63] Together they had a son, He Pengfei (贺鹏飞).[^64] He Long's family life, though fragmented by the demands of revolution and war, remained important to him throughout his career.

Described as flamboyant and charismatic, He Long was known for his distinctive mustache and his magnetic personality.[^9] Unlike some austere Communist leaders, he was outgoing and gregarious, "unable to walk down the street without attracting a crowd."[^24] These qualities made him an effective military leader and political organizer, able to inspire loyalty among his troops and mobilize peasant populations. He was recognized as "a fine orator," using his speaking abilities to communicate Communist ideology and military strategy to largely illiterate audiences.[^65]

After 1949, He Long maintained interests beyond military affairs. As Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, he headed the National Sports Commission, a position that reflected both his physical vigor and the Party's belief in promoting mass athletics.[^66] In this role, he facilitated sports exchanges with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries during the 1950s, becoming one of the most well-traveled members of the Chinese Communist Party elite.[^67] He led numerous delegations abroad, meeting with leaders in other Asian countries, the Soviet Union, and East Germany, representing China on the international stage during a period of relative diplomatic isolation.[^68]

## Legacy

He Long's legacy embodies both the heroic narrative of Communist revolution and the tragedy of political persecution. His Former Residence at Longjiaguan Village in Sangzhi County was restored to its original form in 1975, just six years after his death, exhibiting 185 photos and over 50 relics from different periods of his life.[^69] The site has become a center for "red tourism," part of China's effort to commemorate revolutionary history and educate citizens about the Party's founding generation.[^70]

Sangzhi County itself is now known as "the home of Marshal He Long and the starting point of the Long March of the Second Front Red Army," with his memory deeply embedded in local identity.[^71] The county's promotion of He Long's legacy has contributed to regional economic development through heritage tourism, though this commercialization of revolutionary history remains somewhat controversial.[^72]

After Deng Xiaoping consolidated power in the late 1970s and began dismantling the Cultural Revolution's extremist policies, He Long was posthumously rehabilitated. At the Fifth Plenum of the 11th Central Committee in 1980, He Long, Peng Zhen, Peng Dehuai, and other leaders who had been purged during the Cultural Revolution were formally rehabilitated, their revolutionary contributions officially recognized and their persecution condemned.[^73][^74] Mao Zedong had actually authorized a partial rehabilitation of He Long in 1974, before his own death, suggesting some recognition that the charges against He Long had been fabricated.[^75]

In 1987, a stadium in Changsha, the capital of He Long's native Hunan Province, was named in his honor, symbolizing his restored status as a revolutionary hero.[^76] This memorial, along with museums and monuments throughout Hunan, ensures that He Long's contributions to Chinese Communist victory are publicly commemorated. His inclusion among the Ten Marshals of the People's Liberation Army, a rank awarded in 1955 to recognize the most distinguished military leaders of the revolution, remains his most enduring official honor.[^77]

He Long's historical significance extends beyond his military achievements to his symbolic value as a representative of peasant revolutionaries who rose from poverty and obscurity to shape modern China's trajectory. His story—from impoverished Tujia minority youth to outlaw to warlord to Communist marshal—encapsulates the social upheaval and transformation that characterized China's revolutionary era.[^78] That such a celebrated figure could be so thoroughly destroyed during the Cultural Revolution also serves as a cautionary reminder of the period's arbitrary cruelty and the vulnerability of even the most loyal revolutionaries to political persecution.[^79]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly assessments of He Long emphasize his crucial military contributions to Communist victory. His leadership of the Second Front Army during the Long March demonstrated both strategic capability and political loyalty at a critical juncture when the Communist movement faced potential annihilation.[^80] Unlike Zhang Guotao, who challenged Mao's authority and led his forces to destruction, He Long subordinated personal ambition to Party discipline, preserving his army and reinforcing Mao's leadership.[^81] This decision fundamentally shaped the Communist movement's subsequent development and eventual triumph.[^82]

Military historians credit He Long with exceptional skill in guerrilla warfare, particularly his ability to establish and maintain base areas in hostile territory.[^83] His success in expanding Communist-controlled regions during the Second Sino-Japanese War, despite operating behind Japanese lines with limited resources, demonstrated the effectiveness of Mao's military doctrine of "people's war."[^84] The 120th Division's operations in northwestern Shanxi served as a model for guerrilla warfare that was studied and emulated by other Communist forces.[^85]

He Long's role in establishing professional sports administration in early Communist China is also noted positively by historians of Chinese athletics.[^86] His leadership of the National Sports Commission during the 1950s laid foundations for China's eventual emergence as a major force in international sports.[^87] The sports exchanges he facilitated with Soviet and Eastern European countries helped break China's international isolation and provided technical expertise that advanced Chinese athletic development.[^88]

Defenders of He Long's legacy emphasize his loyalty to the revolutionary cause over nearly half a century of service, from his decision to join the Nanchang Uprising in 1927 through his persecution during the Cultural Revolution.[^89] Despite opportunities to defect to the Nationalists or to pursue warlord independence, He Long remained committed to the Communist Party, even when that commitment cost him his life.[^90] This unwavering dedication, even in the face of unjust persecution, has made him a symbol of revolutionary integrity in official Chinese historiography.[^91]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars note that He Long's early career as a bandit and warlord involved violence and extraction that harmed local populations, raising questions about whether romantic narratives of "social banditry" adequately capture the reality of such armed groups.[^92] The transition from warlord to revolutionary commander did not entirely erase the authoritarian and sometimes brutal methods typical of warlord armies, which carried over into Red Army practice.[^93]

Historians examining Communist land reform campaigns in areas under He Long's control have documented violence against landlords and "rich peasants" that sometimes exceeded Party policy directives.[^94] While defenders argue such measures were necessary to break feudal power structures, critics contend that the campaigns involved human rights abuses and established patterns of class-based persecution that would intensify during later political movements.[^95]

Some analysts view He Long's failure to more forcefully oppose Mao's increasingly autocratic leadership during the 1950s as a moral failure, arguing that senior military leaders like He Long bore responsibility for not challenging policies like the Great Leap Forward that caused mass famine.[^96] Though He Long did attempt to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai after Peng's criticism of Mao, this effort was belated and ineffective, suggesting limited political courage in confronting the Chairman's authority.[^97]

International scholars of the Cultural Revolution use He Long's persecution and death as evidence of the movement's fundamentally destructive character.[^98] The fabricated charges against him, his prolonged torture through medical neglect, and his death in custody exemplify how the Cultural Revolution consumed even the revolution's founding generation.[^99] That someone of He Long's stature and loyalty could be so thoroughly destroyed demonstrates the totalitarian nature of Maoist politics at its peak and the absence of institutional protections for even the most senior officials.[^100]

## Famous Quotes

While specific quotes by He Long are not extensively documented in English-language sources, his daughter He Jiesheng captured the spirit of his Long March legacy:

> "It is a miracle that I could survive the path full of dangers and also full of promises in the one-year Long March." - He Jiesheng, reflecting on her journey as a 19-day-old infant during the Long March led by her father[^62]

During his persecution, He Long described his treatment in chilling terms:

> "[They] intended to destroy my health so that they can murder me without spilling my blood." - He Long, describing conditions during his house arrest, 1967-1969[^57]

These words reflect both the extraordinary resilience required during the revolutionary period and the cruel sophistication of persecution during the Cultural Revolution. He Long's legacy is preserved more through his actions and the testimony of those who knew him than through extensive written or recorded statements.
