## Summary

This is the event that started it all. On June 24, 1947, private pilot **Kenneth Arnold** saw nine shiny, crescent-shaped objects flying in echelon formation near Mount Rainier.

He clocked their speed at over 1,700 mph (far faster than any aircraft of the time). When he described their motion to reporters as "like a saucer skipping across water," the press focused on the word "saucer," mistakenly calling them **"Flying Saucers."** This term stuck, launching the modern UFO phenomenon.[^1]

## The Sighting

### The Flight
Arnold was flying a CallAir A-2 from Chehalis to Yakima, looking for a crashed Marine Corps plane.
*   **The Flash:** At 3:00 PM, a bright flash lit up his cockpit. He thought it was a P-51 Mustang but saw no other planes.
*   **The Chain:** He saw 9 objects in a line, weaving in and out of the mountain peaks. They were thin and flat, "like a pie plate cut in half."
*   **Speed:** He timed them between Mount Rainier and Mount Adams. The calculation (50 miles in 1:42) put them at supersonic speeds.

## Legacy

*   **Project Sign:** The Air Force began investigating UFOs (Project Sign -> Grudge -> Blue Book) directly because of this report.
*   **Roswell:** The famous Roswell crash happened just weeks later (July 1947), fueled by the "saucer craze" Arnold started.
