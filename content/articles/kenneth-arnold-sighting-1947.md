## Overview

On June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, a private pilot and fire control equipment salesman, was flying his CallAir A-2 past Mount Rainier. He was looking for a lost Marine Corps transport plane (hoping for the reward money). Instead, he found the beginning of a modern mythology. He reported seeing nine high-speed, shiny objects flying in echelon formation.

## "Like a Saucer Skipping on Water"

Arnold estimated their speed at **1,200 mph** (faster than the speed of sound, which hadn't been broken yet by Chuck Yeager).
**The Misquote:**
Arnold described their motion as "like a saucer if you skip it across the water."
The press headline next day read: **"Supersonic Flying Saucers Sighted."**
Thus, the term "Flying Saucer" was born. Ironically, Arnold said the craft were actually crescent-shaped (like a boomerang or flying wing), not round saucers. But the name stuck, and soon people started reporting *round* disks.

## The Great Wave of 1947

Arnold's sighting wasn't isolated. It triggered a massive wave of sightings across the US.
Two weeks later, looking for similar "saucers," a rancher in **Roswell, New Mexico**, found strange debris in his field.
The US Air Force started **Project Sign** (later Project Blue Book) directly because of the Arnold report.

## Credibility

Arnold was an experienced pilot and a respected businessman. He wasn't a crackpot.
The military took him seriously. They concluded he definitely saw *something*, possibly a mirage, possibly secret Soviet aircraft (Horton flying wings?), or possibly extraterrestrial.
Arnold maintained his story until his death: *"I saw what I saw."*
