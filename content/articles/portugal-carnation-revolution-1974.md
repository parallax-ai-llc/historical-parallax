## Summary

On April 25, 1974, Portugal proved that a revolution could be made with flowers. In the early hours of the morning, young military officers seized control of Lisbon. By nightfall, Europe's longest-lived dictatorship had collapsed—almost without a shot fired. Citizens flooded the streets, placing red carnations in the barrels of the soldiers' guns. The flowers became the symbol of a revolution born in hope rather than bloodshed.[^1]

The Estado Novo (New State) had ruled Portugal for 48 years. It had silenced opposition, jailed dissidents, and waged brutal colonial wars in Africa that killed thousands and drained the nation. The regime was finally brought down not by workers or students, but by the very military officers sent to fight its wars—men who had seen the empire's cruelty and futility firsthand.[^2]

The Carnation Revolution stands nearly alone in history: a military coup that led to genuine democracy, a regime change accomplished without civil war, a nation that chose freedom and kept it. April 25 remains Portugal's national holiday—Freedom Day—a reminder that even entrenched power can fall when its own defenders choose to stop defending it.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Estado Novo

The Estado Novo (New State) was one of Europe's most durable authoritarian regimes:

**Origins:**
- 1926: Military coup ended unstable First Republic
- 1932: António de Oliveira Salazar became Prime Minister
- 1933: New constitution—corporatist, Catholic, authoritarian

**Characteristics:**
- **Censorship:** All media controlled; opposition press banned
- **Secret police:** PIDE (Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado) monitored citizens
- **No political parties:** Single-party state
- **Catholic conservatism:** Church deeply intertwined with regime
- **Economic backwardness:** Portugal remained Western Europe's poorest nation

**Salazar ruled until 1968**—when a beach chair collapsed, causing a brain hemorrhage that incapacitated him. He was replaced by Marcelo Caetano, who made minor reforms but maintained the system.[^4]

### The Colonial Wars

Portugal's African empire became its tomb:

**The colonies:**
- Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe
- Also Goa (lost to India, 1961), East Timor, Macau

**1961-1974: Thirteen years of war**
- **Angola:** War began 1961
- **Guinea-Bissau:** War began 1963
- **Mozambique:** War began 1964

**The cost:**
- 45% of government budget on military
- 8,000+ Portuguese soldiers killed
- 100,000+ wounded
- Atrocities on all sides
- Conscription deeply unpopular
- Economic drain crippling

**The turning point:**
- By 1974, Portugal was losing
- Guinea-Bissau effectively independent
- Angola and Mozambique unwinnable
- Officers saw futility firsthand[^5]

### Military Discontent

The officers who made the revolution came from the colonial wars:

**Captains, not generals:**
- Junior officers (captains, majors)—not high command
- Battle-hardened, disillusioned
- Saw regime sacrificing soldiers for lost cause
- Knew the war was unwinnable

**MFA: Movimento das Forças Armadas (Armed Forces Movement)**
- Formed September 1973
- Initially focused on professional grievances
- Quickly became political
- By early 1974: openly planning regime change

**Key figures:**
- Otelo Saraiva de Carvalho (operational commander)
- Vasco Gonçalves
- Salgueiro Maia (led tanks into Lisbon)[^6]

## The Revolution

### The Signal

**April 25, 1974, 00:25 AM:**
The song "E Depois do Adeus" (And After the Farewell) played on Emissores Associados de Lisboa radio—the first signal.

**At 00:00 (midnight) turning to April 25:**
The second signal: "Grândola, Vila Morena" by Zeca Afonso played on Rádio Renascença

This banned protest song, about a town where "the people are the ones who rule," was the final go-ahead. Operations began.[^7]

### The Coup

**Early hours, April 25:**

**Lisbon:**
- Captain Salgueiro Maia led armored column from Santarém
- Tanks entered Lisbon before dawn
- Strategic points seized: airport, radio stations, ministries
- Little resistance

**Porto and elsewhere:**
- Coordinated seizures across the country
- Regime collapsed everywhere simultaneously

**By morning:**
- Radio broadcasts announced the coup
- MFA communiqués assured population: "Stay calm. Go to work."
- But the streets filled anyway[^8]

### Caetano's Surrender

**Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano took refuge in the Carmo Barracks (GNR headquarters)**

**1:30 PM:**
- Building surrounded by tanks and crowds
- Salgueiro Maia negotiated

**Caetano's condition:**
- Would only surrender to General António de Spínola (respected moderate)
- Did not want to hand power to "the rabble" (captains)

**7:00 PM:**
- Spínola arrived
- Caetano surrendered
- Regime transferred power to the MFA
- **No shots fired at the barracks**

**Night of April 25:**
- PIDE headquarters resisted; some shots fired
- PIDE agents killed 4 people—the only casualties of the revolution
- Crowd attacked PIDE building; agents eventually surrendered[^9]

### The Carnations

**The flowers became the revolution's symbol:**

**The story:**
- A woman named Celeste Caeiro was working at a restaurant
- The restaurant was supposed to open that day; carnations had been ordered for the celebration
- When she saw the soldiers, she began giving them flowers
- Others followed

**Soon:**
- Red carnations in rifle barrels
- Soldiers wearing flowers
- Crowds throwing flowers
- The bloodless coup became the Carnation Revolution

**The image endured:** Young soldiers, flowers in their guns, liberation without massacre.[^10]

## The Aftermath

### The Three D's

The MFA announced three goals:

1. **Democratizar** (Democratize): Free elections, civil liberties
2. **Descolonizar** (Decolonize): End the colonial wars, grant independence
3. **Desenvolver** (Develop): Economic modernization

### Immediate Changes

**Within days:**
- Political prisoners released (including Álvaro Cunhal, Communist leader)
- Exiles returned (including Mário Soares, Socialist leader)
- PIDE dissolved
- Censorship ended
- Political parties legalized

**April 25 became Freedom Day**—Portugal's national holiday[^11]

### Decolonization

The empire ended quickly:

| Colony | Independence |
|--------|--------------|
| Guinea-Bissau | September 1974 |
| Mozambique | June 1975 |
| Cape Verde | July 1975 |
| São Tomé and Príncipe | July 1975 |
| Angola | November 1975 |
| East Timor | November 1975 (immediately invaded by Indonesia) |

**The cost of decolonization:**
- 800,000 Portuguese "retornados" fled Africa, returned to Portugal
- Angola and Mozambique descended into civil wars (Cold War proxies)
- But the colonial wars ended[^12]

### Political Turbulence (1974-1976)

**PREC (Processo Revolucionário em Curso):**
The year after the revolution was chaotic:

- **Six provisional governments in two years**
- **Power struggle:** MFA, Communists, Socialists, conservatives
- **Land seizures:** Workers occupied estates in south
- **Nationalizations:** Banks, industries taken over
- **Radicalization:** Some feared second Cuba

**Hot Summer of 1975:**
- Communist influence growing
- Anti-communist backlash in north
- Risk of civil war

**November 25, 1975:**
- Left-wing military faction attempted to radicalize revolution
- Moderate military under António Ramalho Eanes prevailed
- The revolution stabilized[^13]

### Constitutional Democracy

**1976:**
- New democratic constitution adopted
- First free elections in April
- **Mário Soares (Socialist) became Prime Minister**
- **General Ramalho Eanes elected President**

**Portugal became:**
- Parliamentary democracy
- Joined EEC (EU) in 1986
- Integrated into Western Europe
- Stable and prosperous[^14]

---

## Death Toll

**Remarkably low:**

- **4 killed** on April 25 (by PIDE agents)
- Additional deaths during PREC period (1974-1975)—dozens in various incidents
- **No civil war**
- **No mass executions of former regime officials**

**Comparison:** Other transitions from dictatorship in the era (Spain, Greece, Latin America) often far bloodier.[^15]

## Why It Succeeded

### Military Unity

Unlike most coups, the MFA represented a genuine movement:
- Hundreds of officers coordinated
- United by colonial war experience
- Genuine ideological commitment (not just power grab)
- Enlisted men supported officers

### Regime Weakness

The Estado Novo was hollow by 1974:
- Salazar dead, Caetano uninspiring
- Colonial wars draining resources
- Economic stagnation
- International isolation growing
- No domestic legitimacy

### No Violent Opposition

Critical factors:
- Regime forces didn't fight (most were in Africa)
- Police (except PIDE) didn't resist
- Popular support was overwhelming
- Violence would have been futile

### Good Fortune

- Key units in right places
- Communications not disrupted
- No miscalculation that could have caused bloodshed[^16]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Was It Really Peaceful?

**Mostly yes:**
- The coup itself: 4 deaths (by PIDE, not soldiers)
- PREC period: Some violence, but nothing like civil war
- No purges of old regime
- Remarkable restraint

**Caveats:**
- Colonial wars themselves had been brutal
- Decolonization led to wars in Angola, Mozambique
- Violence was displaced, not absent

### Why Did Officers Choose Democracy?

This question fascinates historians:
- Colonial war radicalized them
- Contact with African liberation movements
- Exposure to left-wing ideas
- Genuine belief in democratic ideals
- Portuguese tradition of constitutionalism (First Republic)

**The military gave up power.** Most juntas don't.[^17]

### Legacy for Democratic Theory

The Carnation Revolution became a model:
- Proof that authoritarian regimes can fall peacefully
- Military can be agent of democratization
- Elite fracture (military turning) as key variable
- Influenced thinking about transitions in Spain, Latin America, Eastern Europe[^18]

---

## Legacy

### For Portugal

**Annual celebration:**
- April 25: Freedom Day, national holiday
- "Grândola, Vila Morena" still sung
- Carnations still placed in rifles at commemorations

**Political memory:**
- Debate over meaning of April 25 continues
- Right criticizes PREC radicalism
- Left celebrates revolutionary moment
- All agree dictatorship was wrong

### International Influence

**Third Wave of Democratization:**

The Carnation Revolution is often dated as the beginning:
- **1974:** Portugal
- **1975:** Spain (Franco's death, transition)
- **1974-1975:** Greece (junta collapsed)
- **1980s:** Latin America democratizations
- **1989:** Eastern Europe
- **1990s:** Africa

**Portugal showed it was possible.**[^19]

### Symbols That Endure

- **Carnation in rifle barrel:** Universal image of peaceful revolution
- **"Grândola, Vila Morena":** Still protest anthem worldwide
- **April 25:** Referenced in democracy movements globally
