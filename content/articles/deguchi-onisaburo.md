## Summary

Deguchi Onisaburo was the co-founder and organizational genius behind Oomoto, one of Japan's most influential new religious movements. He married the daughter of founder Nao Deguchi and transformed the movement into a major force. He was an incredibly prolific writer, artist, and visionary who dictated the 81-volume Reikai Monogatari. The movement was suppressed by the government in 1921 and 1935 for challenging state authority.
