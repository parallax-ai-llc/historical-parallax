## Summary

Henrietta Swan Leavitt was an American astronomer who discovered the period-luminosity relationship for Cepheid variable stars, one of the most important findings in astronomy. This relationship enabled astronomers to measure distances to far-away galaxies and proved essential to Edwin Hubble's discovery that the universe is expanding. Despite her groundbreaking work, she received little recognition during her lifetime as one of the 'Harvard Computers.'
