## Summary

William Randolph Hearst built the nation's largest newspaper chain and a media empire that included magazines, radio, and newsreel companies. His sensationalist style of yellow journalism helped provoke the Spanish-American War. He served in Congress and ran for president and governor of New York. His life inspired Orson Welles' film Citizen Kane, and his castle at San Simeon became a California landmark.
