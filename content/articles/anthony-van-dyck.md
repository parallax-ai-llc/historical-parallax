## Summary

Sir Anthony van Dyck (1599-1641) was a Flemish Baroque master who revolutionized portrait painting and became the most important court painter in 17th-century England.[^1] Born into a prosperous merchant family in Antwerp, he trained under Rubens before establishing himself as an international artistic celebrity in Italy, Flanders, and England.[^2] Best remembered for his elegant portraits of King Charles I and the English aristocracy, van Dyck's relaxed yet refined style dominated British portraiture for over 150 years and influenced generations of painters including Reynolds and Gainsborough.[^3] His innovations included the "grand manner" of full-length portraiture, groundbreaking portrait prints in his Iconography series, and a sophisticated workshop system that made him both artist and entrepreneurial manager.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Anthony van Dyck was born on March 22, 1599, in the wealthy heart of Antwerp, the seventh of twelve children born to Frans van Dyck, a prosperous silk merchant, and Maria Cuypers.[^5] He was baptized the following day, March 23, entering a stable, closely-knit, and deeply pious Catholic family that would shape his religious sensibilities throughout his life.[^6] The van Dyck household was well-established in Antwerp society, with Frans serving as president of the lay Confraternity of the Holy Sacrament.[^7] Anthony remained particularly close with his sisters Susanna and Isabella, both of whom became nuns, and his brother Theodoor, who entered the priesthood.[^8]

Tragedy struck early when Maria Cuypers died in 1607, when Anthony was only eight years old.[^9] Despite this loss, his mother's artistic influence endured—she had been a talented embroiderer who encouraged young Anthony's evident gift for painting.[^10] On his mother's side, there were also several artists who were Guild members, providing the boy with familial connections to Antwerp's artistic community.[^11]

Van Dyck's precocious talent manifested remarkably early. When he was ten years old in 1609, he began formal training as a painter with Hendrick van Balen the Elder, a successful painter of small cabinet paintings who maintained multiple pupils.[^12] It was in van Balen's Antwerp studio that Anthony learned the fundamentals of painting—grinding pigment, preparing canvases, and mastering basic techniques.[^13] Estimates vary on the duration of this apprenticeship, ranging from two to four years.[^14]

By his late teens, van Dyck was already successful as an independent painter, demonstrating extraordinary facility that distinguished him from his contemporaries.[^15] His first independent works were created around 1615-16, when he was merely sixteen years old.[^16] On October 18, 1617, at the remarkably young age of 18, he became a master in the prestigious Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke, a testament to his already formidable skills.[^17] By this time, he had begun working in the studio of Peter Paul Rubens, the leading northern painter of the day, who would become the single most important influence on his artistic development.[^18]

## Rise to Prominence

Van Dyck's relationship with Peter Paul Rubens, who was twenty-two years his senior, transcended the typical master-pupil dynamic and became profoundly formative.[^19] Though the exact origins and nature of their relationship remain unclear, it has been speculated that van Dyck worked as a pupil in Rubens' studio from about 1613, even before he became a Guild master.[^20] In 1618, rather than establishing himself solely as an independent master, van Dyck elected to join Rubens's studio as an assistant while maintaining his own studio with pupils—an unusual arrangement that reflected both his ambition and Rubens' recognition of his talent.[^21]

Around 1617, he gave up his own independent studio entirely to become Rubens's chief assistant, creating a mutually beneficial relationship: van Dyck helped Rubens complete many important commissions while Rubens taught him advanced aspects of the artistic process.[^22] Rubens referred to the nineteen-year-old van Dyck as "the best of my pupils," and the older master became something of a father figure, filling the void left by Anthony's mother's death and his disintegrating relationship with his own father.[^23] A correspondent reported on July 17, 1620, that "van Dyck is still staying with Rubens and his works begin to be appreciated as much as those of his master."[^24]

The collaboration between the two artists was substantial. Van Dyck contributed to major projects including "Achilles Discovered by Ulysses and Diomedes" (1617-1618), now in the Prado Museum in Madrid, which was a collaboration between the two painters.[^25] Van Dyck probably also assisted on Rubens' large-scale project to produce prints after his paintings, with a group of finished black chalk drawings from around 1620 attributed to van Dyck.[^26]

In November 1620, van Dyck made his first journey to England, working for the Earl of Arundel and receiving an annual salary of £100 from King James I—a substantial sum that indicated royal recognition.[^27] This initial English sojourn lasted only from November 1620 to February 1621, but it established important connections that would later prove crucial.[^28] In October 1621, van Dyck set out for Italy, embarking on what would become a transformative six-year period that fundamentally shaped his mature style.[^29]

Van Dyck arrived in Genoa on November 20, 1621, beginning an Italian odyssey that lasted until 1627.[^30] He spent most of his time in Genoa, though he also passed eight months in Rome in 1622 and made shorter visits to Florence, Bologna, Venice, Padua, Mantua, and Milan.[^31] In 1623, most of his time was devoted to Genoa, though he was in Rome between March and October of that year.[^32] During 1624, he ventured to Palermo, where he painted the Spanish viceroy.[^33]

The Italian period proved artistically revolutionary. It was in London, in the collection of the Earl of Arundel, that van Dyck first encountered the work of Titian, whose use of color and subtle modeling of form offered a transformational stylistic language that enriched the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.[^34] Van Dyck's sketchbook, now preserved in the British Museum, testifies to his profound attraction to the Venetian masters, especially Titian.[^35] He made many rapid sketches of their compositions, occasionally adding notes about color and spontaneous words of praise.[^36] Titian's influence remained with van Dyck for the rest of his life, and inventories reveal that he later owned no fewer than nineteen paintings by Titian, as well as his own copies of several others.[^37]

In Genoa, van Dyck developed his signature portrait style for the aristocracy, painting the city's nobility in full-length portraits that drew on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens' own Genoese period style.[^38] These portraits featured extremely tall but graceful figures who looked down on the viewer with great hauteur, establishing a distinctive aristocratic type with slender figures and proud bearing.[^39] A superb example is the full-length "Marchesa Elena Grimaldi" (1623), now in the National Gallery in Washington.[^40] For the Genoese aristocracy, he crafted images of such elegance and authority that they became templates for aristocratic portraiture across Europe.[^41]

## Major Achievements

Van Dyck returned to Antwerp in 1627, entering what would become one of his most productive periods.[^42] Between 1628 and 1632, he painted some of his finest religious works, beginning in 1628 with major altarpieces for local churches, including "The Martyrdom of St. Augustine" for the Augustinian convent in Antwerp.[^43] Around 1630, he became official court painter to Archduchess Isabella, the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, producing many religious works including large altarpieces during this period.[^44] When he returned to Antwerp after his Italian sojourn, van Dyck painted several Crucifixions for different churches in the city, and also executed smaller-format works depicting Christ on the Cross without secondary figures.[^45]

During his Antwerp period of 1627-1632, van Dyck painted more affable portraits that still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible, employing what he called a "silvery sheen" in his portraits—a luminous quality that eluded sharp contrasting light and shadow.[^46] He also undertook his revolutionary Iconography project, probably begun during this Antwerp period.[^47] This became a very large series of prints with half-length portraits of eminent contemporaries that would fundamentally change the conventions of portraiture.[^48]

The Iconography was a printmaking project featuring over 100 portrait prints that radically depicted artists on par with the most significant monarchs, diplomats, and scholars of the day—an unprecedented democratization of portraiture.[^49] Though already celebrated internationally for his work as a painter, van Dyck contributed directly to the series, producing fifteen etchings with his own hands for which he etched the heads and main outlines of the figure, leaving engravers to work up the details.[^50] He left most of the printmaking to specialists who engraved after his drawings, with Paulus Pontius contributing more plates than any other printmaker.[^51] The Iconographie proved highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking and provided a repertory of images that were utilized by portrait painters throughout Europe for the next two centuries.[^52]

In 1632, van Dyck moved to London at the request of Charles I to become the principal court painter to the English monarch.[^53] The King knighted him in July 1632 and granted him a pension of £200 a year, with van Dyck being described as "principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties."[^54] He was an immediate success in England, where he painted large numbers of portraits of the King and Queen, as well as their children and the aristocratic court.[^55] Van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of Queen Henrietta Maria, nine of the Earl of Strafford, and multiple portraits of other courtiers.[^56]

His Blackfriars studio in London was frequently visited by the King and Queen, and a special causeway was later built to ease their access—an indication of the extraordinary favor he enjoyed.[^57] Charles and Henrietta Maria hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived, demonstrating the monopoly he held on royal portraiture.[^58] In England, he developed a version of his style that combined relaxed elegance and ease with understated authority in his subjects, creating images that would dominate English portrait-painting until the end of the 18th century.[^59]

Van Dyck's best-known work is his portrait of King Charles I in hunting garb, circa 1634, now in the Musée du Louvre in Paris.[^60] In this masterpiece, "Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King."[^61] This portrait exemplifies van Dyck's revolutionary approach: informal yet majestic, relaxed yet authoritative.

Van Dyck introduced many new types of portraiture to Britain that had not previously existed in English art: groups of children without their parents, double portraits showing friends or siblings, powerful men attended by their secretaries, and images of the ruler on horseback.[^62] He also continued to paint mythological, allegorical and biblical subjects, including altarpieces, and displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman and was an important innovator in watercolor and etching.[^63]

With the exception of Holbein, van Dyck and his contemporary Diego Velázquez were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, fundamentally revolutionizing the genre.[^64] Van Dyck popularized the "grand manner" of full-length portraiture in Britain, and by the 18th century, he epitomized the height of artistic achievement: a celebrity painter honored by the royal family and known for his extraordinary ability.[^65] During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a knighthood, and he was buried in St Paul's Cathedral—an indication of his exceptional standing at the time of his death.[^66]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his overwhelming success and influence, van Dyck's work has been subject to significant criticism, both during his lifetime and in subsequent centuries. Some art historians have blamed van Dyck for diverting what they consider a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition—represented by painters such as William Dobson, Robert Walker, and Isaac Fuller—into what certainly became "elegant blandness" in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, particularly Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller.[^67] These critics argue that van Dyck's emphasis on flattery and aristocratic elegance came at the expense of psychological penetration and truthfulness.

The tension between flattery and realism remained a persistent concern in assessments of his work. Van Dyck's images flattered those he portrayed, though he still managed to capture their essence, conveying elements of their personality through his nuanced use of expression, color, and posture.[^68] He is particularly noted for introducing a unique informality of composition to his portraits and for his flattering renderings which succeeded in losing none of the individuality of the sitter.[^69] However, when compared with his contemporary Velázquez, van Dyck's portraits are generally acknowledged to have flattered more.[^70]

Interestingly, van Dyck's use of flattery was selective and strategic rather than universal. When painting his friend François Langlois, he "portrayed his friend with great affection and with no attempt at the flattery he used on his English courtiers," suggesting that his flattering approach was particularly reserved for aristocratic patrons rather than personal friends.[^71] This selective application raises questions about artistic integrity versus commercial necessity in court painting.

Van Dyck's workshop practices also generated controversy and continue to complicate scholarly assessment. As demand for his portraits increased, he developed highly efficient production methods that some critics viewed as compromising artistic quality. According to contemporary accounts, he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself, often using blue paper for these preparatory studies.[^72] He would grant sitters hour-long appointments in which he sketched their outlines and painted their faces, with assistants subsequently painting the rest of the portrait, leaving only the head, hands, and final touches to van Dyck himself.[^73]

This assembly-line approach meant that sometimes he painted only the heads and hands, and his practice became one of "methodical efficiency, with subjects hustled in and out by the hour, each making way for the next sitter."[^74] He responded to high demand by adopting efficient production methods and ruling over a workshop of many assistants, each set a clearly defined task, so much so that he stands not only as van Dyck the artist, but also as van Dyck the entrepreneurial manager.[^75] The "beauty shop" was described as "a well-oiled machine that produced portraits on a metaphorical assembly line."[^76]

While both reproductive prints and the numerous copies made by his specially qualified workshop assistants were instrumental in disseminating van Dyck's art and securing his fame, the involvement of less experienced students is "particularly obvious in the application of colour, which is less subtle than the original in some workshop copies."[^77] This raises ongoing questions about attribution and quality, though most art historians now agree that "most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so consensus among art historians on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach."[^78]

Van Dyck's work has also suffered from striking neglect in academic art history, particularly in the Anglophone world, with scholars reporting not encountering his works in undergraduate or graduate coursework despite specializing in early modern Northern European art.[^79] Furthermore, van Dyck has eluded sustained critical engagement with feminist and queer theories prevalent among modern-day art historians and literary scholars, suggesting that his courtly, aristocratic subject matter may not align with contemporary academic interests.[^80]

His critical reputation has also fluctuated across centuries. Whereas formerly the works of his last English period were most admired, those of his youth and of his Genoese period were favored in the 20th century for their freshness and spontaneity.[^81] This shift reflects changing aesthetic values and suggests that van Dyck's work continues to be reassessed through different critical lenses.

## Personal Life

Van Dyck's personal life was complex, marked by romantic entanglements, delayed marriage, and ultimately, tragic brevity. For much of his career, he kept a mistress named Margaret Lemon, who was known equally for her beauty and her fierce temper.[^82] Lemon detested when van Dyck painted female sitters without a chaperone, reflecting the possessive nature of their relationship.[^83] According to some sources, when she discovered that van Dyck was to marry Mary Ruthven, Lemon attempted to mutilate him by biting his right thumb—the hand with which he painted.[^84]

Van Dyck had at least one daughter with Margaret Lemon before his marriage, and on his deathbed, he also acknowledged another illegitimate daughter named Maria-Theresia, indicating he had fathered children outside of marriage.[^85] These relationships reveal a personal life considerably more complicated than the elegant, refined image projected in his self-portraits and court paintings.

Van Dyck married Mary Ruthven on February 27, 1640, under pressure from the King and Queen.[^86] Mary was the daughter of Patrick Ruthven, who styled himself Lord Ruthven, although the title was forfeited.[^87] She came from an aristocratic, if impoverished, family of Scottish Catholics and served as a maid of honor to Queen Henrietta Maria.[^88] The marriage, undertaken relatively late in van Dyck's life when he was already forty-one years old, would prove tragically brief.

By mid-1641, van Dyck's health was deteriorating. A letter dated August 13, 1641, from Lady Roxburghe reported on van Dyck's failing health, and by November, his condition had worsened significantly.[^89] He had traveled to Paris but returned to England as his illness progressed.[^90] On December 1, 1641, Mary gave birth to their daughter Justiniana—van Dyck's legitimate heir.[^91]

Van Dyck died just eight days later, on December 9, 1641, at his house in Blackfriars, London, the same day as the baptism of his daughter Justiniana.[^92] He was only forty-two years old.[^93] Two days later, on December 11, 1641, he was buried in the choir of St Paul's Cathedral—an extraordinary honor that reflected his status as the most important artist in England.[^94] A monument was erected to his memory by order of King Charles I, but both the grave and monument perished when St Paul's Cathedral was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666.[^95]

Van Dyck left behind a daughter less than two weeks old, as well as his other illegitimate children, though little is known about their subsequent lives. His wife Mary Ruthven survived him, dying in 1645, just four years after her husband.[^96]

## Legacy

Van Dyck's legacy in the history of art is profound and enduring, particularly in the realm of portrait painting. His greatest legacy was in portraiture, where he pushed the boundaries of what a portrait could be and modernized the genre for generations to come.[^97] Van Dyck's influence turned British portraiture away from the stiff, formal, "iconic" approach of Tudor and Jacobean painting; his distinctive fluid, shimmering style and elegant compositions dominated portraiture in Britain for the next three centuries.[^98]

Van Dyck was the dominant influence on English portrait-painting for over 150 years, and he fundamentally revolutionized the genre by demonstrating that court portraiture could be both flattering and psychologically perceptive, both elegant and naturalistic.[^99] He set a new style for Flemish art and founded the English school of painting, with portraitists Sir Joshua Reynolds and Thomas Gainsborough being his direct artistic heirs.[^100] Thomas Gainsborough's famous deathbed words capture van Dyck's enduring significance: "We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company."[^101]

The 18th-century critic and biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori said that Rubens would only cede to van Dyck in the field of portraiture, and no other—high praise indeed, given Rubens' reputation as the greatest northern painter of the age.[^102] Jonathan Richardson, in his "Essay on the Theory of Painting" (1715), articulated the conventional English view: "When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art."[^103]

Nearly all the great 18th-century portraitists copied van Dyck's costumes, poses, and compositions, from Pompeo Batoni and Allan Ramsay to Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds.[^104] Gainsborough was particularly devoted to van Dyck's work, making several copies after the earlier artist and deliberately establishing himself in this great lineage of European artists.[^105] Gainsborough's famous "Blue Boy" put into practice many of the elements van Dyck made popular: showing the subject standing upright, placing him in a natural setting, positioning the figure so that the viewer is forced to look up at him, and dressing him in knee breeches and a doublet with lace collar—a costume typical of van Dyck's time, 100 years prior to Gainsborough's own era.[^106]

Van Dyck's enormous influence on English art did not come from a tradition handed down through his pupils, but rather through the power and availability of his works themselves.[^107] Many younger Flemish painters owed more to him than to Rubens.[^108] Dutch and German portraitists, especially those active in London, including Sir Peter Lely and Sir Godfrey Kneller, continued his manner, as did several native Englishmen.[^109]

Beyond portraiture, van Dyck's innovations in printmaking had lasting impact. The Iconographie was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking, and both reproductive prints and the numerous copies made by his workshop assistants were instrumental in disseminating his art, heightening his fame and securing his place in the history of art.[^110]

Van Dyck introduced unprecedented informality and psychological nuance to portrait painting. He is particularly noted for introducing a unique informality of composition to his portraits and for his flattering renderings which succeeded in losing none of the individuality of the sitter.[^111] He was able to blend realism with an idealized appearance, making his portraits appear both real and timeless.[^112]

His technical innovations also left a lasting mark. He enjoyed using bold tints and colors for various objects and surfaces in his works, and he was so well-defined in this aspect that "van Dyck brown" was named after him—a particular shade that became standard in artistic practice.[^113] He was most noted for his flesh tones, inspired by Frans Hals and his extensive use of the color palette.[^114]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Van Dyck's reputation has generally been extraordinarily high among art historians and critics. The conventional view, articulated by Jonathan Richardson in 1715, has been consistently favorable: "When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art."[^115] This assessment reflects a widespread belief that van Dyck fundamentally elevated British portraiture to international preeminence.

With the exception of Holbein, van Dyck and his contemporary Diego Velázquez were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionizing the genre and demonstrating that portraiture could be a vehicle for the highest artistic achievement.[^116] Van Dyck was the most important Flemish painter of the 17th century after Rubens, and a prolific painter of portraits of European aristocracy who also executed many works on religious and mythological subjects, proving himself a fine draftsman and etcher.[^117]

The 17th-century critic and biographer Giovanni Pietro Bellori offered particularly high praise, stating that Rubens would only cede to van Dyck in the field of portraiture, and no other—an extraordinary compliment given Rubens' towering reputation.[^118] This assessment placed van Dyck at the very pinnacle of portraiture, suggesting that even the greatest painter of the age acknowledged van Dyck's superiority in this specific genre.

Van Dyck's images flattered those he portrayed, yet he managed to capture their essence, conveying elements of their personality through his nuanced use of expression, color, and posture—a balance that many scholars view as his greatest achievement.[^119] He introduced many new types of portraiture to Britain that had not previously existed, including groups of children without their parents, double portraits showing friends or siblings, powerful men attended by their secretaries, and images of rulers on horseback, thereby expanding the expressive possibilities of the genre.[^120]

Recent scholars have noted that van Dyck's soft, sweeping brushstrokes provide an early example of the Baroque style of which he would become a master, demonstrating technical innovation alongside compositional creativity.[^121] His color palette evolved throughout his career: in Italy he used richer colors in the fashion of Roman antiquity and a more classical style, while in Antwerp he employed a silvery sheen in his portraits that eluded sharp contrasting light and shadow conditions.[^122]

### Negative Views

Despite his generally elevated reputation, van Dyck has faced significant criticism from certain quarters of art historical scholarship. Some critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition—represented by painters such as William Dobson, Robert Walker, and Isaac Fuller—into what certainly became "elegant blandness" in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, like Lely or Kneller.[^123] These critics argue that van Dyck's emphasis on flattery and aristocratic grace came at the expense of psychological depth and truthfulness.

Contemporary scholarship reveals that van Dyck's work has suffered from striking neglect in academic art history, particularly in the Anglophone world, with scholars reporting that they did not encounter his works in undergraduate or graduate coursework despite specializing in early modern Northern European art.[^124] This neglect suggests a disconnect between van Dyck's historical importance and his relevance to contemporary academic concerns.

Furthermore, van Dyck has eluded sustained critical engagement with feminist and queer theories prevalent among modern-day art historians and literary scholars, indicating that his courtly, aristocratic subject matter and celebratory approach to power may not align with contemporary critical frameworks.[^125] Recent scholars are invested in making the case for serious critical inquiry of English-period van Dyck beyond connoisseurial, technical, and archival research, suggesting that previous scholarship has been too focused on attribution and technique rather than broader cultural and ideological questions.[^126]

Contemporary scholarship now engages not only with van Dyck himself but with his legacy regarding social and artistic hierarchies as well as genealogies of artistic influence and national identity, tracing his reception from his contemporaries in the 1630s through to eighteenth-century London painters.[^127] This more critical approach examines how van Dyck's portraits reinforced aristocratic ideology and social hierarchies, rather than simply celebrating their aesthetic achievements.

The question of authenticity and workshop production remains a persistent issue. Van Dyck's assembly-line production methods, in which he painted only heads and hands while assistants completed the rest, has led some to question the artistic integrity of works bearing his name.[^128] While most art historians agree that van Dyck's assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, making attributions relatively straightforward, the involvement of less experienced students is particularly obvious in some workshop copies where the application of color is less subtle than in autograph works.[^129]

Critical preferences have also shifted over time. Whereas formerly the works of his last English period were most admired, those of his youth and of his Genoese period were favored in the 20th century for their freshness and spontaneity, suggesting that different eras value different aspects of his oeuvre.[^130] This fluctuation in taste indicates that van Dyck's reputation, while consistently high, has been subject to the changing values and priorities of successive generations of viewers and scholars.

## Famous Quotes

While Anthony van Dyck was primarily a visual artist rather than a writer and left behind limited written records, several quotes about him by contemporaries and later admirers capture his significance:

> "The best of my pupils" - Peter Paul Rubens, referring to nineteen-year-old van Dyck[^131]

This endorsement from the greatest northern painter of the age established van Dyck's credentials early in his career and signaled that he was destined for artistic greatness.

> "Van Dyck is still staying with Rubens and his works begin to be appreciated as much as those of his master" - Letter dated July 17, 1620[^132]

This contemporary observation reveals that by age twenty-one, van Dyck was already being compared favorably to Rubens himself, an extraordinary recognition of his talent.

> "When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face-Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art" - Jonathan Richardson, "An Essay on the Theory of Painting," 1715[^133]

Richardson's assessment, written nearly a century after van Dyck's arrival in England, testifies to his transformative and enduring impact on British portraiture.

> "We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company" - Thomas Gainsborough on his deathbed[^134]

Gainsborough's final words, spoken over a century after van Dyck's death, reveal the profound reverence with which later British painters regarded him, viewing him as the supreme exemplar of their art.

> "Rubens would only cede to Van Dyck in the field of portraiture, and no other" - Giovanni Pietro Bellori, 17th-century critic and biographer[^135]

Bellori's claim that even Rubens acknowledged van Dyck's superiority in portraiture represents the highest contemporary critical praise, positioning van Dyck as the unrivaled master of the portrait genre.
