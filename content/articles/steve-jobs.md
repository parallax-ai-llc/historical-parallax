## Summary

Steven Paul Jobs (1955-2011) was an American entrepreneur, inventor, and business magnate who co-founded Apple Inc. and transformed multiple industries—personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and retail. His perfectionist design philosophy, emphasis on user experience, and "reality distortion field" leadership style made Apple the world's most valuable company. Jobs famously returned to Apple in 1997 after being ousted in 1985, overseeing the launches of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad. His Stanford commencement address ("Stay hungry, stay foolish") and his death from pancreatic cancer at 56 cemented his status as the defining entrepreneur of the digital age.
