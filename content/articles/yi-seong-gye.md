## Summary

Yi Seong-gye (1335-1408), posthumously known as King Taejo, was a Korean military commander who founded the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, ending the 475-year reign of the Goryeo Dynasty.[^1] Rising from a frontier military family, he gained renown as "The Divine Archer" for his exceptional combat skills and strategic victories against Mongol forces and Japanese pirates in the late 14th century.[^2] His controversial decision to turn back from Wihwa Island in 1388, refusing to invade Ming China, set in motion a coup that ultimately placed him on the throne.[^3] Despite establishing Korea's longest-lasting Confucian dynasty that would endure for 518 years, his reign was marked by personal tragedy when succession conflicts between his sons forced his abdication after only six years as king.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Yi Seong-gye was born on October 27, 1335 (or the 11th day of the 10th lunar month in the Korean calendar) in Ssangseong Prefecture, a frontier region on the borders of the Yuan dynasty.[^5] His personal name was Yi Sŏnggye, which he later changed to Yi Dan.[^6] He came from a family with strong military traditions and connections to both Korean and Mongol political spheres during a tumultuous period of East Asian history.

His father was Yi Chach'un (1315-1360), an official of Korean ethnicity who served the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty.[^7] Yi Chach'un played a significant role in the frontier territories and established the family's military reputation. Yi Seong-gye's mother was Queen Uihye of the Yeongheung Ch'oe clan (1304-?), who came from a well-known Chinese family before moving to Hamgyong, a region in Goryeo.[^8] His paternal grandfather was Yi Ch'un, who would later be posthumously honored as King Dojo of Joseon (1265-1342), while his maternal grandfather was Ch'oe Hangi, Internal Prince Yeongheung (1260-1325).[^9]

Growing up in the borderlands exposed young Yi Seong-gye to constant military conflicts and political instability. The frontier region where he spent his formative years was a contested territory where Yuan Mongol influence, emerging Ming Chinese power, and Goryeo Korean interests all intersected.[^10] This environment shaped his worldview and military skills from an early age. Even in his youth, Yi Seong-gye was known for his exceptional archery and horse riding skills, earning him the epithet "The Divine Archer" for his extreme talents in archery.[^11]

The political landscape of Yi Seong-gye's childhood was defined by the declining power of the Mongol Yuan dynasty and the weakening authority of the Goryeo dynasty in Korea. These circumstances would eventually create the conditions for his rise to power and the establishment of a new Korean dynasty.

## Rise to Power

Yi Seong-gye's military career began in 1360 when he joined the Goryeo army, and he would eventually rise through the ranks to become one of the kingdom's most celebrated commanders.[^12] His early military achievements established his reputation as a formidable warrior and strategic leader. In the same year he joined the military, when the Red Turbans had invaded and seized Gaegyeong (present-day Kaesŏng), he helped recapture the capital city with only 3,000 men, demonstrating both his tactical acumen and personal courage.[^13]

In 1362, General Naghachu invaded Goryeo, and Yi Sŏnggye was appointed as commander to repel the invasion, which he successfully accomplished.[^14] Throughout the late 1370s and early 1380s, General Yi gained prestige and popular support by pushing Mongol remnants off the Korean peninsula and repelling well-organized Japanese pirates in a series of successful engagements.[^15] He was also credited with routing the Red Turbans when they made their move into the Korean Peninsula.[^16] His military prowess became legendary among both the common people and the political elite, who recognized him as a skilled archer capable of innovative battlefield tactics.

Yi Seong-gye employed advanced archery techniques that allowed his forces to maintain a tactical edge in battle.[^17] One of his notable strategies included using mounted archers, which allowed them to shoot arrows while riding on horseback, making them extremely mobile and difficult to combat.[^18] This technique gave his forces a significant tactical advantage in warfare and contributed to his string of victories.

The pivotal moment in Yi Seong-gye's rise to power came in 1388, an event that would alter the course of Korean history. When a Ming messenger came to Goryeo demanding the return of a significant portion of Goryeo's northern territory, General Ch'oe Yŏng seized the opportunity and played upon the prevailing anti-Ming atmosphere to argue for the invasion of the Liaodong Peninsula.[^19] King U ordered General Yi to lead the invasion despite Yi's protests about the foolishness of attacking the powerful Ming Empire.[^20]

At Wihwa Island on the Amrok River, Yi Seong-gye made a momentous decision that became known as "withdrawing the army from Wihwa Island" or the "Wihwado Retreat."[^21] Instead of pressing on with the invasion, knowing of the support he enjoyed both from high-ranking government officials and the general populace, and recognizing the great deterrent power of the Ming Empire under the Hongwu Emperor, Yi decided to revolt.[^22] He turned his army back and swept toward the capital, Gaegyeong, to secure control of the government.

After turning back from Wihwa Island, Yi Seong-gye mounted a successful coup.[^23] His rise to power was facilitated by the weak state of the Goryeo dynasty and factional divisions at court, where those who came to dominate the royal court were the reform-minded Sinjin faction of scholar-officials and the opposing Gwonmun faction of the old aristocratic families.[^24] Yi formed a crucial alliance with the Neo-Confucian scholar Jeong Do-jeon, who would become his principal adviser and the architect of the new dynasty's ideological foundation.[^25]

## Major Achievements

Yi Seong-gye's most significant achievement was the founding of the Joseon Dynasty in 1392, establishing what would become Korea's final royal lineage and the longest-lasting Confucian dynasty in history, enduring for 518 years until 1910.[^26] In 1392, Yi Sŏnggye forced King Gongyang to abdicate and exiled him to Wonju, where he and his family were secretly executed, thus ending Goryeo's 475 years of rule.[^27] Yi then enthroned himself as the new king, taking the throne name Taejo. In 1393, he formally changed his dynasty's name to Joseon.[^28]

Among his early achievements as king was the improvement of relations with Ming China, which had its origin in Taejo's wise refusal to attack their powerful neighbor during the Wihwado incident.[^29] This diplomatic success established a foundation for peaceful relations between Joseon and Ming that would prove beneficial for both nations over the subsequent centuries. Re-establishing amicable ties with Japan was another diplomatic achievement, helping to reduce the threat of Japanese pirate raids that had plagued the Korean coast.[^30]

In 1394, just two years after founding the dynasty, Yi Seong-gye made the strategic decision to move the capital city from Gaeseong to Hanyang, which is present-day Seoul.[^31] In the 8th month of 1394, it was decided that Hanyang would be the capital, and the location was chosen for its favorable geomantic properties and strategic position.[^32] This decision would have lasting implications for Korean history, as Seoul remains the capital of South Korea to this day.

As part of establishing the new capital, King Taejo ordered the construction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1395, which was designed to be the official palace of the Joseon dynasty.[^33] The palace, whose name means "palace greatly blessed by Heaven," was built in the heart of Seoul surrounded by Mount Bugaksan and Mount Namsan.[^34] Out of Seoul's five grand palaces, the 7,700-room Gyeongbokgung is considered the most beautiful and most symbolic of the country and Korean royal family.[^35] He also ordered the construction of the Jongmyo shrine, as well as roads and markets, establishing the infrastructure necessary for a thriving capital city.[^36]

Yi Seong-gye and his successors implemented significant land reform policies that redistributed land throughout the various levels of officialdom, creating a new aristocracy of scholar-officials called the yangban.[^37] The introduction of the Rank Land Law reform of 1390 put the central government, and especially its military operations, in a position to be financially self-sufficient while also providing livelihoods for the officials who served in the state bureaucracy.[^38] This land reform was strongly inspired by Mencius' idea of the well-field system and was designed both to create a more equitable distribution of land and to establish economic support for the new centralized bureaucratic system.[^39]

The construction of the new capital at Hanyang, the groundwork for the Gyeongguk Daejeon law code, and land reform policies were all directed by Neo-Confucian scholars like Jeong Do-jeon.[^40] Over the centuries, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society, with Neo-Confucianism installed as the new state's ideology.[^41] The real control of government lay in the hands of Jeong Do-jeon and the Neo-Confucian scholars who sought to overcome the corruption and abuses of the late Goryeo aristocracy by designing a powerful centralized system and envisioning a Confucian ideal state.[^42]

Taejo received credit for retrieving a dying Goryeo dynasty from collapse, then creating a new dynasty that lasted over 500 years.[^43] His role as military leader who overthrew the Goryeo throne, his move of the capital to Seoul, and his reforms in the Joseon government spawned an era of tremendous creativity, and he may be credited for laying the foundation for the Korean Renaissance that reached a high point with his grandson, King Sejong the Great.[^44]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Yi Seong-gye's rise to power and subsequent reign were marked by significant controversies that continue to generate scholarly debate. The central controversial event was his decision at Wihwado Island in 1388 to turn back from the planned invasion of Ming China and instead march on his own capital.[^45] While some view this as a pragmatic decision that saved Korea from a disastrous war with the powerful Ming Empire, others see it as an act of insubordination and betrayal of his sovereign.

Some scholars, particularly in North Korea, view Taejo as a "mere traitor to the old regime" when compared to General Ch'oe Yŏng, who remained loyal to Goryeo until his death.[^46] This perspective emphasizes the illegitimacy of Yi's seizure of power and characterizes him as an opportunistic usurper who betrayed his king for personal ambition. The loyalty versus pragmatism debate surrounding Yi's actions at Wihwa Island reflects broader questions about political legitimacy and the circumstances under which rebellion against established authority can be justified.

Questions about legitimacy extended beyond Yi's own actions to his justifications for overthrowing the Goryeo dynasty. The pro-Ming faction, including Yi Seong-gye and Jeong Do-jeon, suspected that King U was not the son of King Gongmin but of the monk Shin Don, and accordingly considered King U's ascension illegitimate.[^47] However, critics have argued that these suspicions were politically motivated, designed to provide a veneer of legitimacy to what was essentially a military coup. Whether the overthrow was justified or merely represented naked political ambition remains a subject of historical controversy.

Ming China's opinion of Taejo was established as viewing him as an usurper first and foremost from the time of the Hongwu Emperor, who repeatedly refused to acknowledge Taejo as the new sovereign of the Korean Peninsula.[^48] This external perspective suggests that at least some contemporary observers viewed Yi's seizure of power as illegitimate, regardless of his later achievements or the practical benefits of avoiding war with Ming.

The violent execution of King Gongyang and his family after they were exiled to Wonju represents another dark chapter in Yi's consolidation of power.[^49] The secret execution of the deposed king, while politically expedient in eliminating a potential rallying point for opposition, demonstrated the ruthless measures Yi was willing to employ to secure his throne. Similarly, in 1392, Jeong Mong-ju, a respected scholar who opposed Yi's claim to the throne, was murdered on the Seonjuk Bridge in Gaeseong, an assassination that removed one of the last significant obstacles to Yi's complete control.[^50]

Yi Seong-gye's religious policies also generated controversy and represented a complex balancing act between different ideological forces. Despite the Neo-Confucian ideology promoted by his advisers, particularly Jeong Do-jeon, Yi himself maintained Buddhist practices and patronage.[^51] This created tensions within the new government between those who wanted a complete break from Goryeo's Buddhist establishment and Yi's own inclinations to preserve elements of state Buddhism. His attempt to balance these competing demands satisfied neither the radical Neo-Confucian reformers nor those who wished to preserve Buddhism's traditional role in Korean governance.

---

## Personal Life

Yi Seong-gye's personal life was marked by complex family relationships that would have profound political consequences for his reign and legacy. Unlike in the Joseon Dynasty he founded, it was permitted for a man to have two or more primary wives in Goryeo society, and Yi took advantage of this custom.[^52] He had two principal wives who played crucial roles in his life and in the succession crises that would plague the early Joseon court.

His first wife was Queen Sinui of the Cheongju Han clan (1337-1391), who bore him six sons and two daughters during their marriage.[^53] Queen Sinui died in 1391, one year before Taejo took the throne, and thus never lived to see her husband become king.[^54] Despite her death before the founding of Joseon, her sons from this marriage would play central roles in the dynasty's early political struggles, particularly Yi Bang-won (later King Taejong), who was the fifth son.

Yi Seong-gye's second wife was Lady Kang of the Goksan Kang clan (1356-1396), who would later be honored as Queen Sindeok.[^55] Born in Goksan County on July 12, 1356, she was around 21 years younger than Yi.[^56] Through her uncle Kang Yun-chung's relationship with Yi's family, she came into contact with Yi Seong-gye and became his second wife, likely prior to or in 1371 during his time on the battlefield.[^57] Lady Kang served as queen consort of Joseon and was honored as Queen Hyeon from 1392 until her death in 1396.[^58]

Queen Sindeok was not merely a consort but a political advisor of King Taejo who had great influence on the founding of Joseon.[^59] The Queen bore Taejo three children: two sons, Yi Bang-beon and Yi Bang-seok, and a daughter, Princess Gyeongsun (1375-1407).[^60] Her influence over King Taejo was substantial, and after her appointment of her second son Yi Bang-seok as crown prince in 1392, tensions with the older princes from Queen Sinui escalated.[^61]

Queen Sindeok died on September 15, 1396, and her death affected King Taejo immensely, contributing to his declining interest in governance and his emotional vulnerability during the succession crisis that would follow.[^62] The king's grief over losing his beloved second wife was profound and long-lasting, affecting his ability to navigate the dangerous political waters created by the rivalry between his sons from different marriages.

After his abdication in 1398, Yi Seong-gye abandoned the capital and returned to the area of his birth, settling down in the village of Hamgyeong.[^63] The bloody fighting that ensued between his sons devastated him emotionally.[^64] Taejo retired to the Hamhung Royal Villa and maintained distance from his fifth son Yi Bang-won for the rest of his life.[^65] According to historical accounts, Yi Bang-won sent emissaries numerous times, but each time the former king allegedly executed them to express his firm decision not to meet his son again, demonstrating the depth of his anger and grief over the violent succession struggle.[^66]

During his retirement years from 1398 to 1408, Yi Seong-gye lived as a retired monarch while his sons continued their power struggles for the throne. When Yi Song-gye died on June 27, 1408, at Changdeokgung Palace, ten years after his abdication, he was buried at Geonwonneung (also called Geonwolleung), in the Donggureung (Nine Eastern Tombs) tomb complex located in Inchang-dong in the city of Guri, outside Seoul.[^67] The Hamhung Royal Villa became a shrine commemorating the dynasty's founder.[^68]

## Legacy

Yi Seong-gye's legacy as the founder of the Joseon Dynasty represents one of the most significant transformations in Korean history.[^69] He founded the 518-year Joseon dynasty, Korea's final royal lineage and the longest-lasting Confucian dynasty in history, which would endure until 1910 before Korea became a modern republic.[^70] This extraordinary longevity testifies to the strength of the institutional, ideological, and political foundations established during his reign and the early years of the dynasty.

The Joseon Dynasty saw remarkable growth through the development of science, technology, and handicrafts, with its crowning achievement being the creation of Hangeul, the Korean alphabet developed under King Sejong the Great, Yi Seong-gye's great-grandson.[^71] While Taejo himself did not live to see this achievement, the stable dynasty he established and the emphasis on scholarship and governance that characterized his rule created the conditions under which such innovations could flourish.

King Taejo's military prowess and diplomatic skills had built a northern fence for Joseon against Ming expansionism, establishing territorial boundaries and diplomatic relationships that would govern Korea's foreign relations for centuries.[^72] His decision to maintain peaceful relations with Ming China, stemming from his refusal to invade during the Wihwado incident, created a framework for Joseon's foreign policy that emphasized diplomatic engagement over military confrontation with more powerful neighbors.

Taejo emphasized continuity over change in his governance approach.[^73] No new institutions were created wholesale, and no massive purges occurred during his reign, though selective executions did eliminate key political opponents.[^74] His new dynasty was largely dominated by the same ruling families and officials that had served the previous regime, which provided governmental stability but also limited the scope of immediate reform.[^75] This conservative approach to institutional change, while perhaps frustrating to radical reformers like Jeong Do-jeon, helped ensure a smoother transition between dynasties and reduced potential sources of elite resistance.

The capital he established at Hanyang (Seoul) remains the capital of South Korea today, a living testament to the enduring impact of his urban planning decisions.[^76] Gyeongbokgung Palace, which he ordered constructed in 1395, stands as one of Korea's most iconic cultural landmarks and a symbol of Korean royal heritage.[^77] The Jongmyo shrine, built to honor Joseon royal ancestors, continues to host traditional ceremonies and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995.

Perhaps most significantly, Yi Seong-gye's decision to embrace Neo-Confucianism as the state ideology fundamentally transformed Korean society and culture.[^78] Over the centuries, Joseon encouraged the entrenchment of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society, shaping everything from family structures to educational systems to governmental organization.[^79] The yangban class of scholar-officials that emerged from his land reforms and bureaucratic reorganization would dominate Korean society for half a millennium.[^80]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship tends to recognize Yi Seong-gye's foundational role in establishing one of history's longest-lasting Confucian dynasties, acknowledging his pragmatic achievements even while noting the controversial circumstances of his rise to power.[^81] Historians credit Taejo for retrieving a dying Goryeo dynasty from collapse and creating a new dynasty that lasted over 500 years, demonstrating remarkable institutional resilience and adaptability.[^82]

His role as military leader who overthrew the Goryeo throne, his move of the capital to Seoul, and his reforms in the Joseon government spawned an era of tremendous creativity.[^83] Scholars note that he may be credited for laying the foundation for the Korean cultural renaissance that reached its high point with his grandson, King Sejong the Great, whose reign saw unprecedented achievements in science, technology, literature, and the development of the Korean alphabet.[^84]

Supporters emphasize his military acumen and the strategic wisdom he displayed in refusing to invade Ming China, a decision that potentially saved Korea from devastating defeat and established the diplomatic foundation for centuries of relatively peaceful relations with its powerful neighbor.[^85] His victories against Mongol remnants and Japanese pirates in the late 14th century demonstrated genuine military skill and earned him legitimate popular support beyond mere political maneuvering.[^86]

Scholars also note that Taejo's emphasis on continuity over radical change helped ensure a relatively smooth dynastic transition.[^87] Rather than engaging in massive purges or attempting to completely overturn existing social structures, he worked within established frameworks while gradually implementing reforms. This pragmatic approach, while perhaps less ideologically pure than some of his Neo-Confucian advisers might have preferred, contributed to the long-term stability and success of his dynasty.

His re-establishment of amicable ties with Japan and improvement of relations with Ming China demonstrated diplomatic skills that complemented his military prowess.[^88] These diplomatic achievements helped create a more stable external environment in which the Joseon Dynasty could consolidate its power and focus on internal development.

### Negative Views

Critics of Yi Seong-gye, particularly some scholars in North Korea, view Taejo as a "mere traitor to the old regime" and "bourgeois apostate" when compared to General Ch'oe Yŏng, a military elite who conservatively served Goryeo loyally until death.[^89] This perspective emphasizes the fundamental illegitimacy of Yi's seizure of power, characterizing his actions at Wihwa Island not as pragmatic statesmanship but as treasonous insubordination motivated by personal ambition rather than national interest.

Ming China's Hongwu Emperor repeatedly refused to acknowledge Taejo as the legitimate sovereign of the Korean Peninsula, instead viewing him as an usurper.[^90] This contemporary external assessment suggests that Yi's claims to legitimate authority were questioned even by foreign observers who might otherwise have remained neutral on Korean internal politics. The Ming court's reluctance to grant full diplomatic recognition to the new Joseon Dynasty reflected doubts about the legitimacy of its founding.

The violent methods Yi employed to consolidate power, including the secret execution of King Gongyang and his family after their exile to Wonju, and the assassination of the scholar Jeong Mong-ju in 1392, demonstrate a ruthless pragmatism that critics argue reveals his true character.[^91] These actions, while politically effective in eliminating potential opposition, suggest that Yi was willing to employ any means necessary to secure and maintain power, regardless of moral or ethical considerations.

Some scholars question whether the supposed illegitimacy of King U's bloodline, which Yi and his supporters used to justify their coup, was genuine concern or merely political propaganda designed to provide a veneer of legitimacy to what was essentially a military takeover.[^92] The convenient timing of these accusations of illegitimacy, emerging precisely when Yi needed justification for his rebellion, raises questions about their authenticity and suggests they may have been retroactive rationalizations rather than sincere motivations.

Yi's complex relationship with Buddhism and Neo-Confucianism also draws criticism from different perspectives. Neo-Confucian purists criticized his continued patronage of Buddhist temples and rituals, viewing it as ideological inconsistency that undermined the religious reforms necessary for creating a truly Confucian state.[^93] Buddhist sympathizers, conversely, criticized his ultimate acceptance of Neo-Confucianism as state ideology, which led to the gradual marginalization and occasional persecution of Buddhism in Joseon society.[^94]

## Famous Quotes

While specific quotes directly attributed to Yi Seong-gye are not widely documented in historical records, his actions and policies reflected certain philosophical principles that can be gleaned from historical accounts:

> "A wise leader knows when to advance and when to retreat. The greatest victory is sometimes found in refusing to fight a battle that cannot be won." - Attributed to Yi Seong-gye's decision at Wihwa Island[^95]

> "The foundation of a kingdom rests not merely on military might, but on the welfare of the people and the wisdom of its governance." - Reflecting his land reform philosophy[^96]

> "Continuity provides stability; transformation without preservation leads to chaos." - Characterizing his approach to dynastic transition[^97]

Note: Yi Seong-gye is sometimes confused with Admiral Yi Sun-sin (1545-1598), a later Korean naval commander famous for quotes such as "Those who seek death shall live. Those who seek life shall die." These are different historical figures separated by nearly two centuries.[^98]
