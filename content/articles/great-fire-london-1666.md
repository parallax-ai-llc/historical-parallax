## Overview

The Great Fire of London gutted the medieval City of London inside the old Roman city walls. It started in a bakery on Pudding Lane and raged for four days, consuming 13,200 houses, 87 parish churches, and Old St. Paul's Cathedral. While the official death toll is shockingly low (only 6–8 verified), this likely ignores the deaths of the poor whose bodies were incinerated. The fire ended the lingering Black Plague (by killing the rats?) and allowed Sir Christopher Wren to rebuild the city with stone and brick, creating the London skyline we know today.

## The Spark

**Sunday, Sept 2, 1 AM:**
Thomas Farriner’s bakery on Pudding Lane. He swore he put the oven out. He didn't.
Sparks ignited stacked fuel.
The summer had been brutally hot and dry. The wooden houses, coated in pitch (tar), were tinder.

## The Spread & Incompetence

**The Mayor's Blunder:**
Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Bloodworth was woken up to see the fire. He famously dismissed it: *"Pish! A woman might piss it out,"* and went back to bed.
By morning, it was unstoppable.
**Firefighting Tactics:**
The standard method was "Firebreaks"—pulling down houses with hooks or blowing them up with gunpowder to starve the fire.
Residents refused to let their homes be destroyed until the King (Charles II) overruled the Mayor and ordered the Navy to blow up buildings.

## The Destruction of St. Paul's

People stored their goods (books, furniture) in the crypt of Old St. Paul's, thinking the stone walls were safe.
They were wrong.
The wooden scaffolding around the roof caught fire. The lead roof melted.
"The stones of Paul's flew like granados, the melting lead running down the streets in a stream." (John Evelyn's Diary).
The cathedral collapsed, burning everything inside.

## The Rebuilding

**The Scapegoat:**
A naive French watchmaker, Robert Hubert, confessed to starting the fire (he was mentally unstable; he wasn't even in London when it started). He was hanged anyway to satisfy the mob who blamed Catholics/French/Dutch.

**Christopher Wren:**
Tasked with rebuilding. He designed 51 new churches and the magnificent **St. Paul's Cathedral**.
New laws required buildings to be brick or stone.
**The Monument:** A 202ft column was built near Pudding Lane. If you lay it flat, it reaches the exact spot of the bakery.
