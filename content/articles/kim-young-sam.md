## Summary

Kim Young-sam (born December 20, 1927; died November 22, 2015) was a titan of South Korean democracy who served as the 7th President from 1993 to 1998.[^1] His inauguration marked the end of thirty years of military rule, ushering in the "Civilian Government" (Moonmin Government). A fearless opposition leader who survived house arrest and hunger strikes, Kim is best known for his bold, lightning-fast reforms early in his presidency: he permanently disbanded the secret military cabal **Hanahoe** and enforced the revolutionary **Real-Name Financial Transaction System**.[^2] However, his legacy is deeply complicated by his controversial decision to merge with the military regime's party to gain power and the catastrophic **1997 Asian Financial Crisis**, which forced South Korea into a humiliating IMF bailout during his final months in office.[^3]

## Early Life and Political Career

Kim Young-sam was born on December 20, 1927, on Geoje Island, South Gyeongsang Province, into a wealthy fishing family. This financial independence would later allow him to fund his political activities without relying on bribes.[^4] He studied philosophy at Seoul National University, graduating in 1952 during the Korean War.[^5]

Kim entered politics as a protégé of South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, but broke with him over constitutional amendments. In 1954, at the age of 26, he became the youngest person ever elected to the National Assembly.[^6] For the next three decades, "YS" (as he was affectionately known) was the face of the opposition against the dictatorships of Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-hwan.

In 1979, as leader of the New Democratic Party, he was expelled from the National Assembly for criticizing Park Chung-hee in an interview with the _New York Times_, famously declaring, "The rooster's neck may be wrung, but the dawn still comes."[^7] His expulsion triggered the Busan-Masan Uprising, which precipitated Park's assassination. Under Chun Doo-hwan, he was placed under house arrest for two years. In 1983, on the third anniversary of the Gwangju Massacre, he staged a 23-day hunger strike that nearly killed him, revitalizing the democracy movement.[^8]

## The Three-Party Merger

In the historic 1987 presidential election, Kim Young-sam and his rival Kim Dae-jung failed to unify, splitting the opposition vote and handing victory to military successor Roh Tae-woo. Stung by this failure and desperate to end military rule, Kim made a shocking pragmatic calculation in 1990.[^9]

Justifying his decision with the famous line, **"To catch a tiger, you must enter the tiger's den,"** Kim merged his party with Roh Tae-woo's ruling party and Kim Jong-pil's conservative faction to form the **Democratic Liberal Party (DLP)**.[^10] This move gave the conservatives a legislative supermajority and positioned Kim as the successor to Roh. While denounced by liberals as a "betrayal of democracy," the gamble paid off. In 1992, he won the presidential election with 42% of the vote, finally achieving the peaceful transfer of power to a civilian.[^11]

## Presidency (1993–1998): The Era of Reform

Kim Young-sam's presidency began with an approval rating of over 90%, fueled by a series of dizzying reforms.

### Disbanding Hanahoe

His most critical achievement was the purge of **Hanahoe**, the secret society within the military that had orchestrated the 12.12 and 5.17 coups. Just days after his inauguration in March 1993, Kim moved with lightning speed, firing Army Chief of Staff Kim Dong-jin and Defense Security Commander Seo Wan-soo.[^12] Over the next few months, he stripped dozens of politically active generals of their stars, effectively ending the military's 30-year interference in politics.

### Real-Name Financial Transaction System

On the evening of August 12, 1993, Kim issued a surprise Emergency Presidential Decree on Finance and Economy.[^13] The decree banned the use of false names in all financial transactions.

- **Impact:** Before this, the wealthy used pseudonyms to hide slush funds and evade taxes. The new system forced billions of dollars out of the shadows, dealing a fatal blow to the underground economy and the nexus of corruption between politicians and businesses.[^14]
- **Legacy:** It is widely considered the single most important anti-corruption measure in modern Korean history.

### Rectifying History

Kim declared that his government was the heir to the Korean Provisional Government and the April 19 Revolution. He launched the **"History Rectification"** campaign, which led to the arrest and trial of former presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo for mutiny and corruption.[^15] He also ordered the demolition of the Japanese General Government Building, a symbol of colonial rule that stood in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace.[^16]

## The Fall: Crisis and Scandal

### The Hanbo Scandal and "Little President"

His administration's moral authority crumbled in 1997 with the collapse of Hanbo Steel, which revealed a massive bribery network. Even more damaging was the arrest of his second son, **Kim Hyun-chul**, known as the "Little President" for his immense backroom influence.[^17] Hyun-chul was charged with accepting bribes in exchange for government favors, humiliating his father who had vowed to "never accept a single penny."

### The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis (IMF Crisis)

The final blow came in late 1997. Following a string of corporate bankruptcies (Hanbo, Kia Motors), foreign investors lost confidence in the South Korean economy. The currency (won) subsequently collapsed.[^18]

- **The Humiliation:** On November 21, 1997, the government was forced to request a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
- **The Cost:** South Korea received a $58 billion package but had to accept harsh austerity measures. Interest rates skyrocketed to 30%, thousands of companies went bankrupt, and nearly 2 million people lost their jobs.[^19]
- **The Effect:** Kim Young-sam left office in disgrace, with approval ratings in the single digits, labeled as the "incompetent president" who bankrupted the nation.[^20]

## Legacy

Kim Young-sam died on November 22, 2015. His funeral was a state affair, bringing together rivals from across the political spectrum.[^21]

### Historical Assessment

**Positive Views:**

1.  **The Father of Civilian Rule:** Without his courageous purge of the military, South Korean democracy might have remained fragile. He institutionalized civilian control, ensuring that tanks would never again roll into Seoul.[^22]
2.  **Anti-Corruption Pioneer:** The Real-Name Financial System fundamentally modernized the Korean economy. Without it, the transparent financial system of today would not exist.[^23]
3.  **Correcting History:** He set the precedent that even former dictators are not above the law, a crucial lesson for the rule of law in Korea.[^24]

**Negative Views:**

1.  **Economic Incompetence:** Critics argue that his administration was obsessed with political reform but ignorant of economics. His premature push for OECD membership and globalize (Segyehwa) policy opened capital markets without proper safeguards, leading directly to the IMF crisis.[^25]
2.  **Opportunism:** The 3-party merger is viewed by many as the "original sin" of modern Korean politics, creating a conservative regional hegemony (Gyeongsang Province dominance) that deepened regionalism and marginalized the Jeolla region.[^26]
3.  **Cronyism:** Despite his clean image, he failed to control his own family, allowing his son to run a shadow government that engaged in the very corruption he claimed to fight.[^27]
