## Summary

Vagit Alekperov is the founder and former president of Lukoil, Russia's largest private oil company. He built Lukoil from Soviet-era oil assets into a global energy company operating in over 30 countries. He was one of the few Russian oligarchs to build his company through industrial management rather than controversial privatization auctions. He resigned from Lukoil's board in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
