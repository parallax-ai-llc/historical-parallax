## Summary

Hakuin Ekaku was a Japanese Zen master who revitalized the Rinzai Zen tradition. All modern Rinzai Zen lineages trace back to him. He systematized koan practice and created many new koans, including the famous 'What is the sound of one hand clapping?' He was also a prolific painter and calligrapher whose Zen art remains highly valued. His emphasis on post-enlightenment practice in the world influenced modern Japanese Buddhism.
