## Summary

Clare of Assisi was an Italian saint who founded the Order of Poor Ladies (now known as the Poor Clares), the first religious order for women established within the Franciscan movement. She was inspired by Francis of Assisi and renounced her wealthy family to live in radical poverty. She fought to maintain the 'privilege of poverty' — the right to own no property at all. She is the patron saint of television because she reportedly saw a Mass on the wall of her cell when too ill to attend.
