## Summary

Henri Poincaré was a French mathematician, theoretical physicist, and philosopher of science who is often described as the last universalist in mathematics. He made fundamental contributions to topology, celestial mechanics, and the theory of dynamical systems. He formulated the Poincaré conjecture, which remained unsolved for nearly a century until Grigori Perelman proved it in 2003. Poincaré also anticipated aspects of special relativity and chaos theory.
