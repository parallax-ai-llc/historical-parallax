## Summary

Shen Wansan was one of the wealthiest merchants in Chinese history during the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. He made his fortune through international maritime trade, particularly with Southeast Asia. He helped finance the construction of the city walls of Nanjing for the Ming emperor. However, his visible wealth attracted imperial jealousy, and he was eventually exiled. His story illustrates the precarious relationship between merchants and political power in imperial China.
