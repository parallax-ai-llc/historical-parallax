## Summary

Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) was a French Rococo painter and draughtsman who revolutionized eighteenth-century art through his invention of the fêtes galantes genre—scenes of bucolic romance suffused with theatrical melancholy.[^1] Despite living only thirty-seven years and suffering from tuberculosis throughout his brief career, Watteau transformed the waning Baroque style into the lighter, more naturalistic Rococo aesthetic.[^2] His innovative use of color, mastery of the trois crayons drawing technique, and enigmatic depictions of love and theater profoundly influenced subsequent artists including François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard.[^3] Though criticized during the Neoclassical period as frivolous, Watteau is now recognized as a forerunner of Romanticism and modernism, whose exploration of individual subjectivity and transient moments anticipated future artistic movements.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Jean-Antoine Watteau was baptized on October 10, 1684, at the Église de Saint-Jacques in Valenciennes, a town in the County of Hainaut that had recently become part of France following the Franco-Dutch War.[^5] Born either on October 10 or the previous day, he was the second of four sons born to Jean-Philippe Watteau (1660-1720), a master tiler and roofer, and Michelle Lardenois (1653-1727).[^6] The family was presumed to be of Walloon descent, reflecting the Flemish cultural heritage of the region.[^7]

According to early biographers, Watteau's childhood was profoundly unhappy, shaped by his father's quarrelsome and violent temperament.[^8] The household atmosphere deeply marked young Antoine's sensitivity, perhaps contributing to the introverted character and emotional fragility that would define his personality throughout life.[^9] Despite these difficulties, the boy displayed exceptional artistic talent from an early age, showing a voracious appetite for reading novels and a passionate love of music.[^10]

Watteau's earliest drawings, believed to include sketches of traveling salesmen and quack medicine peddlers on the streets of Valenciennes, revealed his keen observational powers and interest in theatrical characters.[^11] Recognizing his son's talent, Jean-Philippe may have apprenticed him to Jacques-Albert Gérin, a local painter, though details of this initial training remain obscure.[^12] The young artist's formative experiences in provincial Valenciennes, combined with his exposure to street performers and itinerant entertainers, would later manifest in his sophisticated depictions of commedia dell'arte characters and theatrical subjects.

By 1702, at approximately eighteen years of age, Watteau made the decisive journey to Paris, leaving behind his family and the limited opportunities of provincial life to seek his fortune in the French capital.[^13] This move marked the beginning of a meteoric but tragically brief career that would transform French painting and establish new artistic possibilities for generations to come.

## Rise to Prominence

Watteau's arrival in Paris in 1702 coincided with a period of significant artistic transition in France, and his initial experiences in the capital were far from glamorous.[^14] Shortly after arriving, he found employment in a workshop at Pont Notre-Dame, where he worked for a picture dealer specializing in the mass production of crude copies of devotional paintings and portraits—repetitive, commercial work that nonetheless allowed him to develop his characteristic sketchy, fluid technique.[^15] The drudgery of this period, working in what were essentially artistic sweatshops, contrasted sharply with the refined art he would later create.

Around 1705, Watteau's fortunes improved dramatically when he entered the studio of Claude Gillot (1673-1722), a draftsman, printmaker, and painter who specialized in theatrical subjects.[^16] In Gillot's studio, Watteau became intimately acquainted with the characters of the commedia dell'arte and the world of the Comédie Française and Italian comedy, subjects that would become lifelong passions.[^17] Gillot, himself an ardent fan of improvised theater with its stock characters and theatrical conventions, introduced Watteau to a rich visual vocabulary that would profoundly shape his artistic vision.[^18]

After leaving Gillot's workshop, Watteau worked for Claude Audran III (1658-1734), a designer of ornament and interior decoration who held the prestigious position of curator of the Palais du Luxembourg.[^19] This position granted Watteau unprecedented access to Peter Paul Rubens's magnificent cycle of canvases devoted to Marie de Medici, installed in the palace.[^20] Watteau studied these works intensively, absorbing Rubens's sophisticated use of color, fluid brushwork, and ability to convey movement and emotion—influences that would prove transformative for his own developing style.[^21]

Despite his unconventional training outside the traditional academic system, Watteau competed for the prestigious Prix de Rome at the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1709.[^22] Though he won second place, to his great disappointment he was never sent to study in Italy, depriving him of the classical education that most history painters considered essential.[^23] This setback, however, may have paradoxically freed him to develop his unique artistic voice, unencumbered by strict academic conventions.

In 1710, Watteau returned to Paris as the guest of the art dealer Pierre Sirois, and by 1712, he was accepted into the prestigious French Academy, though with the unusual stipulation that he would need to submit a reception piece before achieving full membership.[^24] His growing reputation brought him into contact with influential patrons, most notably the banker Pierre Crozat, with whom he lived beginning in 1716.[^25] Crozat's house in the Rue Richelieu and country mansion at Montmorency were filled with masterworks—four hundred pictures of the Venetian and Flemish schools and thousands of drawings—providing Watteau with an artistic education rivaling any formal academy.[^26]

After years of delay and several reprimands from the Academy for his failure to submit the required work, Watteau finally presented his reception piece in August 1717: the painting that would become known as *Pilgrimage to the Isle of Cythera*.[^27] The work caused consternation among academicians, as its innovative subject matter fit none of the established categories in the rigid academic hierarchy.[^28] Unable to classify it as history painting, portraiture, genre, landscape, or still life, the Academy took the unprecedented step of creating an entirely new category specifically for Watteau's work, designating him a "painter of fêtes galantes."[^29] This double-edged honor acknowledged Watteau as the inventor of a new genre while simultaneously preventing him from being recognized as a history painter, the highest classification in academic hierarchy.[^30]

---

## Major Achievements

Watteau's most significant achievement was the invention and perfection of the fêtes galantes genre, scenes depicting elaborately costumed ladies and gentlemen engaged in amorous pursuits within idealized, parklike settings.[^31] These works combined elements of genre painting with mythological subjects, creating a distinctive artistic category that reflected the intimate pleasures and personal experiences increasingly valued during the Regency period, as European arts moved away from the hierarchical grandeur of church and royal court.[^32] His paintings featured figures in aristocratic and theatrical dress situated in lush, imaginary landscapes, with encounters that created evocative moods rather than employing narrative in traditional senses.[^33]

His masterpiece *Pilgrimage to the Isle of Cythera* (1717, Musée du Louvre, Paris) depicts amorous couples on the mythical island of Cythera, sacred to Venus, goddess of love, in various stages of their metaphoric "journey" of love.[^34] Watteau created two versions of this subject—one in the Louvre and another in Schloss Charlottenburg, Berlin—and art historians continue to debate whether the couples are arriving on the island to seek love or departing after having found it.[^35] The painting's ambiguity, combined with its technical brilliance and emotional complexity, exemplifies Watteau's ability to suggest rather than declare, to evoke rather than explain.

Among his other major works are *Pierrot* (also known as *Gilles*), a large-scale theatrical painting measuring 184.5 by 149.5 cm, depicting a nearly life-sized figure of the commedia dell'arte character in gleaming white satin.[^36] Behind Pierrot stand other stock characters—the doctor on his donkey, the lovers Leandro and Isabella, and the captain—creating a complex meditation on performance, identity, and melancholy.[^37] The painting's unusual size for Watteau and its enigmatic quality make it one of his most compelling works, now housed in the Louvre after passing through the collections of Baron Denon and Dr. Louis La Caze.[^38]

*Fêtes Vénitiennes* (c. 1718-1719, National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh) exemplifies Watteau's mature style, combining theatrical costuming with parkland settings and subtle psychological interplay between figures.[^39] Similarly, *Love in the Italian Theater* and *Love in the French Theater* demonstrate his lifelong fascination with the stage and its capacity to explore authentic emotion through artificial means.[^40] *The Italian Comedians* (c. 1719-1721, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.) further explores commedia dell'arte characters, revealing how theatrical subjects allowed Watteau to investigate tensions between reality and illusion, psychology and artifice.[^41]

Watteau's final masterpiece, *L'Enseigne de Gersaint* (*Gersaint's Shop Sign*, c. 1720-1721, Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin), represents a departure from his typical parkland settings, depicting instead the interior of his friend Edme François Gersaint's art dealership.[^42] Painted at Watteau's own insistence "in eight days, working only in the mornings... in order to warm up his fingers," this work was intended as signage for Gersaint's shop but transcends its commercial purpose to become a sophisticated meditation on art, commerce, and contemporary taste.[^43] The painting shows customers examining artworks while assistants pack paintings—including what appears to be a portrait of Louis XIV—into crates, possibly symbolizing the transition from the grand manner of the previous century to the more intimate aesthetic of Watteau's era.[^44]

Beyond his paintings, Watteau's drawings represent an equally significant achievement. Perhaps one of the most brilliant and innovative draftsmen of the eighteenth century, he mastered the trois crayons (three-chalk) technique, using red sanguine, black chalk, and white chalk to create drawings with rich coloristic effects approaching those of painting.[^45] His earliest studies used red chalk alone; around 1715, he added white chalk to create his signature method.[^46] Rather than making preparatory studies for specific paintings as academic practice dictated, Watteau drew speculatively, creating a vast repository of figure studies in bound books that he would later incorporate into paintings months or even years after their creation.[^47] According to the Comte de Caylus, Watteau's custom was to maintain these bound books "so that he always had a large number at hand."[^48]

Watteau's distinctive palette—an homage to Rubens and sixteenth-century Venetian colorism recast in delicate pastels suited to Rococo décor—was widely imitated by subsequent artists.[^49] His technical innovations included the use of pale yellow or off-white grounds, flickering brushwork, and multiple layers of thin glaze, creating a sense of mystery and atmospheric depth.[^50] His skillful manipulation of light and shade through chiaroscuro techniques emphasized volumes and gave relief to figures, while light, fluid brushstrokes evoked airy lightness and movement.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite later recognition as a master, Watteau faced significant criticism both during his lifetime and in subsequent periods. Little known beyond a small circle of devotees during his brief career, he "was mentioned but seldom in contemporary art criticism and then usually reprovingly."[^52] His work existed outside mainstream critical discourse, appreciated primarily by a select group of collectors and fellow artists rather than commanding widespread public acclaim.

The most significant limitation imposed on Watteau came from the Academy itself when it designated him a painter of fêtes galantes rather than a history painter.[^53] While this acknowledged his distinct contribution to French art and his blend of modern manners with ancient ideals, some critics suggested this was "a distinction with a limiting difference," implying Watteau was not quite capable of meeting the demands of formally established categories.[^54] The Academy's rigid hierarchy of genres, established in the seventeenth century, ranked history painting—requiring learned knowledge of mythology, the Bible, classical literature, and historical events—as the most prestigious category, making the greatest demands on artists' technical capabilities.[^55] By creating a new, lesser category for Watteau's work, the Academy simultaneously honored and circumscribed his achievement, preventing him from attaining the highest academic recognition.[^56]

Watteau's work also drew criticism for his apparent disregard for professional advancement and financial security. His friend Gersaint noted that Watteau "alarmed his friends by a carelessness about his future and financial security, as if foreseeing he would not live for long."[^57] His notorious irritability and restless temperament made him difficult to work with; he would never settle down in life, moving frequently between different residences and patronage arrangements.[^58] While notoriously moody and asocial, he nonetheless inspired such devoted friendship that he rarely needed a fixed address, as admirers continually offered him accommodation.[^59]

The harshest criticism came during the Neoclassical period, when revolutionary ideals fundamentally altered aesthetic values. Denis Diderot, the influential philosophe and art critic, expressed strong disapproval of Watteau's art, dismissing it as too frivolous alongside works by Boucher and Fragonard.[^60] More dramatically, Jacques-Louis David, the leading painter of revolutionary France, taught his students to despise Watteau as emblematic of the ancien régime's aristocratic decadence.[^61] David's pupils, outraged by Watteau's depictions of peaceful, romantic aristocratic leisure, used his *Embarkation for Cythera* as target practice for bread rolls when it hung at the Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and one student physically attacked the painting with his fist.[^62]

This vehement rejection reflected Neoclassical artists' insistence on returning to order and rationality, promoting cerebral art that needed to be moral, serious, and intellectually rigorous.[^63] With revolutionary France's more egalitarian aspirations, anything associated with aristocracy—including Watteau's elegant fêtes galantes—became suspect.[^64] The softness of paint application and light-hearted subject matter characterizing Rococo painting were recognized as antithetical to Neoclassical values, and Rococo artworks, including Watteau's, were frequently dismissed as mere decorative frivolity.[^65]

Watteau's apparent lack of traditional narrative structure and moral purpose offended critics who believed art should instruct and elevate. His paintings' ambiguity—their refusal to provide clear moral lessons or definitive meanings—troubled those who expected art to serve didactic purposes. The *Embarkation for Cythera* itself epitomizes this ambiguity: scholars still debate whether the figures are arriving at or departing from the island of love, and what this uncertainty signifies about romantic relationships and human longing.[^66]

Finally, Watteau's preference for genre subjects over history painting, and his decision to focus on contemporary entertainments, theatrical performances, and amorous encounters rather than heroic historical events or biblical narratives, positioned him outside the mainstream of academic ambition.[^67] His buyers were primarily bourgeois collectors—bankers and dealers like Pierre Crozat and Jean de Jullienne—rather than aristocratic patrons, further distancing his work from the grand manner associated with royal and ecclesiastical commissions.[^68]

## Personal Life

Jean-Antoine Watteau never married and had no known romantic relationships, yet paradoxically his scenes of love demonstrated remarkable subtlety and psychological insight into amorous feeling.[^69] This apparent contradiction between his personal isolation and his artistic exploration of intimacy adds to the enigmatic quality surrounding his life and work.

Watteau's personality was notoriously difficult. He was described as irritable, restless, moody, and asocial, with rapid changes of temperament that made sustained relationships challenging.[^70] His childhood sensitivity, shaped by his violent and quarrelsome father, manifested in adult life as emotional fragility and an inability to settle into stable living arrangements.[^71] Despite these challenges, he inspired extraordinary devotion among friends, moving frequently between the homes of admirers who offered him residence and support.[^72]

His health problems began in childhood and worsened progressively throughout his life. Sickly and physically fragile from youth, Watteau suffered from what is now believed to have been tuberculosis, a disease that would ultimately claim his life at age thirty-six.[^73] His physical condition contributed to his restless temperament and perhaps to his sense of time's fleeting nature, which permeates his paintings with their emphasis on transient moments and melancholic beauty.

In 1719, Watteau traveled to London, possibly hoping to find new audiences for his talents but also intending to consult with Dr. Richard Mead, a specialist in infectious diseases.[^74] Unfortunately, London's damp and smoky air offset any benefits from Dr. Mead's prescribed wholesome food and medicines, and Watteau's condition continued to deteriorate.[^75]

According to his friend, the art dealer Edme François Gersaint, drawing was Watteau's favorite creative outlet, "bringing him much more pleasure than his finished pictures," and "the pencil took up his every free moment."[^76] This devotion to drawing resulted in thousands of sheets executed in the trois crayons technique, which Watteau kept in bound books for later reference.[^77] When he took up his crayons and brushes, contemporaries noted, "he took delight in his work, and his work gave nothing but delight," suggesting that artistic creation provided refuge from his physical suffering and emotional turbulence.[^78]

Watteau maintained close relationships with several key figures in the Parisian art world. Pierre Crozat, the wealthy banker whose collections included four hundred paintings and thousands of drawings, provided Watteau with both residence and unprecedented access to masterworks by Venetian and Flemish painters.[^79] Jean de Jullienne (1686-1766), another devoted patron, wrote an early biography of Watteau and sponsored a campaign to record his drawings as etchings, ensuring their preservation for posterity.[^80] Gersaint, for whom Watteau painted his final masterpiece as a shop sign, remained a loyal friend until the end, with Watteau ultimately dying in his arms.[^81]

Watteau returned to France from London in 1720, spending six months with Gersaint before moving to the estate of his patron, Abbé Haranger, for his final months.[^82] The Abbé reported that during his last days, Watteau was semi-conscious and mute, unable to speak but clutching a paintbrush and painting imaginary pictures in the air—a poignant image of an artist inseparable from his art even at death's threshold.[^83] He died on July 18, 1721, in Nogent-sur-Marne, probably from tuberculous laryngitis, having lived only thirty-six years but having fundamentally transformed the course of French painting.[^84]

## Legacy

Watteau's death in 1721 at the height of his powers deprived French art of one of its most original talents, yet his influence extended far beyond his brief lifetime, pervading French painting until the emergence of Neoclassicism.[^85] Virtually every artist working in eighteenth-century France, from François Le Moyne (1688-1737) to François Boucher (1703-1770) to Jean-Honoré Fragonard (1732-1806), owed a major debt to Watteau's enigmatic fêtes galantes and elegant trois crayons drawings.[^86]

François Boucher's training directly involved making etchings after Watteau's drawings around 1726-28, an experience that brought his attention to early Rococo aesthetics and profoundly shaped his artistic development.[^87] Influenced by both Rubens and Watteau, Boucher became the most renowned artist of the mature Rococo period, from the 1730s through the 1760s, carrying forward Watteau's coloristic innovations and preference for erotic genre subjects.[^88] Boucher's prize pupil, Jean-Honoré Fragonard, continued the themes of the fête galante in works like *The Musical Contest*, ensuring Watteau's artistic legacy endured through multiple generations.[^89]

Watteau mastered the trois crayons technique to such a degree that his name became permanently associated with it, and the method was widely adopted by later Rococo artists, including Boucher.[^90] His drawings, with their painterly coloristic effects achieved through the combination of red, black, and white chalk, exemplified a new aesthetic concept that, particularly because of their ability to capture the transience of moments, anticipated modernism.[^91] The British Museum, which holds one of the world's finest collections of Watteau drawings built up over two centuries, testified to the enduring fascination with his graphic work.[^92]

Watteau's innovative approach to artistic creation—drawing speculatively from life and maintaining repositories of studies to be incorporated into paintings months or years later—represented a departure from academic practice that foreshadowed more individualistic, intuitive working methods.[^93] Sir Michael Levey noted that Watteau "created, unwittingly, the concept of the individualistic artist loyal to himself, and himself alone," an idea that would become central to Romantic and modern conceptions of artistic identity.[^94]

His brief career spurred the revival of interest in color and movement, revitalizing the tradition of Correggio and Rubens while shifting art away from the Baroque's formal grandeur toward the Rococo's more naturalistic, intimate aesthetic.[^95] Art historian Oliver Wunsch has argued that Watteau's elite patrons appreciated the fragility of his work because it aligned with their view of art as something to be admired in the moment for its capacity to give pleasure—an aesthetic philosophy distinctly different from the moral didacticism or historical commemoration expected of earlier periods.[^96]

Beyond Rococo artists, Watteau's legacy extended to subsequent movements. According to one critical assessment, "in his treatment of the landscape background and of the atmospheric surroundings of the figures can be found the germs of Impressionism," suggesting his influence on nineteenth-century concerns with light, atmosphere, and momentary visual effects.[^97] His enduring impact positions him as a precursor to Romanticism, with his exploration of individual subjectivity, emotional complexity, and the transient nature of experience anticipating later artistic preoccupations.[^98]

The fêtes galantes genre he invented continued to resonate in European art and culture, influencing not only painters but also decorative arts, theater, literature, and music throughout the eighteenth century and beyond. His ability to create works that simultaneously celebrated pleasure and suggested its fleeting nature, that combined theatrical artifice with authentic feeling, established a new aesthetic possibility that artists continue to explore.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

After a period of eclipse during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras, Watteau's reputation rose slowly and steadily throughout the nineteenth century following Napoleon's fall in 1815.[^99] The critical acceptance of Watteau as an early example of the Romantic artist was fostered particularly by the Goncourt brothers, Edmond and Jules, who saw in his work a deep elegiac melancholy that resonated with Romantic sensibilities.[^100] This rehabilitation transformed Watteau from a dismissed decorator of aristocratic frivolity into a profound artist exploring fundamental human experiences.

Modern scholarship has increasingly recognized Watteau's sophisticated exploration of burgeoning modern selfhood and his complex painting techniques.[^101] Art historians now appreciate how his canvases were "joyful in their very absence of academic method—in the way that Watteau freely slung together sketches from his stash that happened to fit in order to get a composition going," an approach that privileged artistic intuition over academic rules.[^102] This recognition of creative freedom as a value in itself represents a fundamental shift from eighteenth-century academic standards.

Watteau's technical mastery receives consistent praise from scholars. His skillful manipulation of light and shade, his chiaroscuro techniques that emphasized volumes and gave relief to figures, and his light, fluid brushstrokes that evoked airy lightness demonstrate exceptional painterly abilities.[^103] His distinctive palette, which revived sixteenth-century Venetian colorism while adapting it to the scale and aesthetic of Rococo décor, represents a sophisticated historical synthesis that goes far beyond mere imitation.[^104]

Contemporary scholars emphasize Watteau's position as a crucial transitional figure who "revitalized the waning Baroque style, shifting it to the less severe, more naturalistic, less formally classical, Rococo," thereby enabling an entire aesthetic movement.[^105] The Metropolitan Museum of Art describes him as "one of the most brilliant and original artists of the eighteenth century" who "had an impact on the development of Rococo art in France and throughout Europe lasting well beyond his lifetime."[^106]

His drawings receive particular scholarly acclaim. Art historians recognize that Watteau's drawings have "the rich coloristic effects of painting," demonstrating that he elevated the status of drawing from preliminary study to finished artwork worthy of appreciation in its own right.[^107] The British Museum's exhibitions and publications dedicated to his drawings testify to their enduring significance for understanding eighteenth-century art and the development of draftsmanship.[^108]

Scholars also appreciate Watteau's psychological depth and ambiguity. His ability to create works that resist simple interpretation, that suggest multiple meanings and emotional states simultaneously, now appears sophisticated rather than deficient.[^109] His paintings' lack of clear narrative resolution invites viewers to project their own experiences and interpretations, creating a participatory aesthetic that aligns with modern sensibilities.[^110]

### Negative Views

Despite modern appreciation, significant critical reservations about Watteau's achievement persist. The Academy's decision to classify him as a painter of fêtes galantes rather than a history painter, while acknowledging his originality, simultaneously indicated that his work did not meet the highest standards of academic ambition.[^111] This classification has led some scholars to argue that Watteau's subjects, however beautifully executed, lack the intellectual depth and moral seriousness expected of truly great art.[^112]

The Revolutionary period's vehement rejection of Watteau's work, while politically motivated, articulated criticisms that retain some force. Denis Diderot's dismissal of Watteau's paintings as "too frivolous" reflected genuine concerns about art's social purpose and its capacity to address serious moral and political questions.[^113] From this perspective, Watteau's focus on aristocratic leisure and romantic dalliance represents a retreat from art's potential to engage with consequential human experiences.

Jacques-Louis David's teaching that students should despise Watteau as emblematic of ancien régime decadence expressed the Neoclassical conviction that art should be moral, serious, and rational rather than merely pleasurable.[^114] The physical violence David's students directed at Watteau's paintings—using them as target practice and even punching them—dramatically embodied the view that such works deserved destruction rather than preservation.[^115] While modern sensibilities reject such iconoclasm, the underlying critique that Rococo art privileges decoration over substance continues to find adherents.

Some critics argue that Watteau's lack of traditional narrative structure and moral clarity represents a failure of artistic ambition rather than sophisticated ambiguity. His paintings, from this perspective, offer surfaces to admire but lack the intellectual content and historical significance that characterize truly important art.[^116] The fact that his patrons were primarily bourgeois collectors rather than aristocratic or ecclesiastical institutions might suggest his work operated in a minor key, serving private pleasure rather than public purpose.[^117]

Contemporary criticism during Watteau's lifetime, though limited, was "usually reproving," suggesting that even sympathetic viewers recognized limitations in his approach.[^118] His failure to travel to Italy and receive classical training, while perhaps enabling his originality, also deprived him of knowledge and skills that might have elevated his work to the highest levels of achievement.[^119]

The association of Watteau's work with the Rococo more broadly exposes it to criticisms directed at that entire movement. Rococo artworks are frequently dismissed as frivolous, and Neoclassical subject matter is often described as a necessary reaction to the lighthearted superficiality of Rococo art.[^120] Artists who rejected "the frivolous sensuality of Rococo art" promoted a more cerebral approach, implying that Watteau's sensual, decorative aesthetic represented a wrong turn in art history.[^121]

Finally, some scholars note that while Watteau's influence on subsequent Rococo artists was profound, this may represent the perpetuation of limited artistic values rather than genuine advancement. The chain from Watteau through Boucher to Fragonard might be seen as increasingly decadent rather than progressively refined, with each generation moving further from serious artistic purpose toward pure decoration and entertainment.[^122]
