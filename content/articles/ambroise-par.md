## Summary

Ambroise Paré is considered the father of modern surgery and forensic pathology. He revolutionized wound treatment by replacing the agonizing practice of cauterization with ligatures to stop bleeding. He also developed prosthetic limbs and improved surgical techniques for amputations during his service as military surgeon to French kings.
