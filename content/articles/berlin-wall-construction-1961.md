## Overview
Overnight, East German troops laid down barbed wire and barriers to stop the mass exodus of citizens to the West. This temporary barrier was soon replaced by a concrete wall that would stand for 28 years.

## Significance
The Wall became the most iconic symbol of the Cold War and the "Iron Curtain" separating the communist East from the democratic West.
