## Overview

On August 13, 1961, East German troops and workers began erecting barriers that would become the Berlin Wall (Berliner Mauer)—sealing off West Berlin from East Germany and East Berlin. The Wall stood for 28 years as the most visible symbol of the Cold War, physically dividing families, neighborhoods, and a nation.

## Background

### Divided Germany (1945-1961)

**Post-WWII Division:**
After Nazi Germany's defeat, Allied powers divided Germany and Berlin:
- **West Germany (FRG):** U.S., British, French zones
- **East Germany (GDR):** Soviet zone
- **Berlin:** Deep in East Germany, also divided into four sectors

**Different Systems:**
- West: Democratic, capitalist, aligned with NATO
- East: Communist, Soviet-controlled, Warsaw Pact

### Berlin Before the Wall

**Island in Communist Territory:**
West Berlin was a Western enclave 100 miles inside East Germany.

**Open Border:**
Until 1961, Berliners could move relatively freely between East and West—subway, walking, working.

## The "Brain Drain"

### Mass Exodus

**Problem for East Germany:**
Massive emigration through Berlin:
- 1949-1961: 3.5 million East Germans fled (~20% of population)
- Doctors, engineers, skilled workers leaving
- Economic and propaganda disaster for GDR

**1961 Crisis:**
Emigration accelerating—1,000+ daily in August 1961.

**Ulbricht's Denial (June 15, 1961):**
East German leader Walter Ulbricht: "Nobody has the intention of building a wall." (Weeks before construction.)

## Construction

### August 13, 1961 ("Barbed Wire Sunday")

**Overnight Operation:**
At midnight, East German soldiers and workers:
- Sealed border crossings
- Rolled out barbed wire barriers
- Tore up streets
- Cut transit lines

**Surprise:**
Berliners woke to find city divided.

### Evolution of the Wall

**Phase 1 (August 1961):**
Barbed wire, makeshift barriers.

**Phase 2 (Later 1961):**
Wooden and concrete segments.

**Phase 3 (1965-1975):**
Solid concrete wall.

**Phase 4 (1975-1989):**
Final "Border Wall 75" (Grenzmauer 75):
- 12-foot concrete slabs
- Anti-vehicle trenches
- Guard towers
- Floodlights
- Dog patrols
- "Death strip" (Todesstreifen)

### Statistics

- Total length: 96 miles (155 km)
- Around West Berlin: 107 miles (112 km of which was concrete wall)
- 300+ guard towers
- 20+ bunkers

## Escape Attempts

### Desperate Flights

**Methods:**
- Jumping from buildings (windows sealed, buildings demolished)
- Tunnels (most famous: "Tunnel 57"—57 escaped)
- Digging through sewers
- Crashing vehicles
- Swimming canals
- Hiding in cars
- Hot air balloons
- Homemade aircraft

### Death at the Wall

**Casualties:**
- At least 140 killed trying to cross
- ~5,000 successful escapes
- 3,200+ arrested attempting

**Peter Fechter (August 17, 1962):**
18-year-old shot climbing Wall. Left to bleed to death in "death strip" while crowds watched helplessly. International outrage.

---

## International Reaction

### Western Response

**Kennedy Administration:**
Initially quiet—U.S. relieved crisis didn't escalate to war.

**JFK Visit (June 26, 1963):**
Famous speech in West Berlin:
> "Ich bin ein Berliner" ("I am a Berliner")

**Symbolism:**
Wall became ultimate Cold War symbol—communism had to imprison its own people.

### Soviet Perspective

**Khrushchev's View:**
Necessary to stop "brain drain" and stabilize East Germany.

## Life with the Wall

### East Berlin

- Travel to West nearly impossible
- Propaganda portrayed Wall as "Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart"
- Secret police (Stasi) monitored population
- Relatives separated for decades

### West Berlin

- Island city, vulnerable
- Subsidized to prevent population decline
- Vibrant but anxious
- Constant Cold War reminder

---

## Checkpoints

**Famous Crossings:**
- **Checkpoint Charlie:** American sector; tense standoffs
- **Checkpoint Alpha (Helmstedt):** Autobahn access
- **Checkpoint Bravo (Dreilinden):** Southwest entry

**Limited Visits:**
West Berliners could visit East only on rare occasions.

## Significance

### Cold War Symbol

The Wall embodied:
- Iron Curtain division of Europe
- Failure of communism (had to imprison citizens)
- Superpower tension
- Human cost of ideology

### Legacy

Led directly to 1989 fall—one of history's most celebrated moments.
