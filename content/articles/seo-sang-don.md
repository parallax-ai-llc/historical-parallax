## Summary

Seo Sang-don (徐相敦, 1850-1913), baptized as Augustine, was a Korean merchant, Catholic philanthropist, and independence activist who led the National Debt Repayment Movement of 1907-1908. Born into a family of Catholic martyrs who suffered persecution for their faith, Seo overcame poverty to become one of Daegu's wealthiest businessmen, harvesting 30,000 bags of rice annually. His patriotic leadership in mobilizing millions of Koreans to repay the nation's debt to Japan through individual donations made him a national hero, and the movement's records were inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World in 2017.[^1][^2] Despite Japanese suppression that ultimately prevented the movement's success, Seo's legacy as both a pioneer of Korean Catholicism and a champion of national sovereignty endures through monuments, museums, and schools he established.

## Early Life and Background

Seo Sang-don was born on October 17, 1850, in Gyeongsang Province (modern-day Gimcheon City) to a Catholic family that had endured generations of religious persecution.[^3] His great-great-grandfather, Seo Gwang-soo, entered the Catholic Church in 1784 with his five sons at the very beginning of Catholicism's introduction to Korea.[^4] This early conversion came at an enormous cost: in March 1785, Seo Gwang-soo was expelled from the Seo clan, stripped of his wealth and title, and the family was torn apart.[^5] Throughout the 19th century, waves of Catholic persecution swept Korea, and young Seo Sang-don witnessed the martyrdom of his three uncles—Seo In-soon, Seo Ik-soon, and Seo Tae-soon—who were killed for their religious beliefs.[^6]

Tragedy struck early when Seo's father, Seo Cheol-sun, died in 1859 when the boy was only nine years old.[^7] He grew up in his maternal grandfather's house in Daegu with his mother (from the Gimhae Kim clan) and sister, raising pocket money by doing errands, fetching firewood, and delivering groceries and other goods.[^8] Despite being born into relative poverty as a result of his family's Catholic faith and the persecution they endured, Seo demonstrated remarkable business acumen from an early age.[^9]

At age 18, with support from local Catholics and the Church, Seo began working as a peddler (bobusang) and quickly prospered in agriculture, paper production, linen manufacturing, and cotton products.[^10] His business expanded dramatically, and he eventually commanded a network of 800 peddlers with a business territory spanning 800 ri (approximately 320 kilometers) from Dongnae to Andong.[^11] By age 35, he had become a successful entrepreneur and philanthropist, wealthy enough to produce an annual average of 30,000 bags of rice, making him one of the leading economic figures in Daegu.[^12] From around 1894, at age 45, he served for approximately ten years as a government tax inspector (geomse-gwan) managing tax grains for Gyeongsang Province.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Seo Sang-don's prominence grew not only through his commercial success but also through his deep commitment to the Catholic Church and his emerging role as a civic leader. His Catholic baptismal name was Augustine, and he became known throughout Daegu as a devout believer who embodied the values of service and community.[^14] Unlike many wealthy merchants of his era who hoarded their fortunes, Seo dedicated himself to using his resources for the public good, particularly for his faith community and the Korean nation.

In the 1890s and early 1900s, as Korea faced increasing threats to its sovereignty from Japanese imperialism, Seo became involved with the Independence Club (독립협회), a reform movement that advocated for Korean independence and modernization.[^15] A branch of the Independence Club was established in Daegu as early as 1898, and Seo was active as a key member, though the organization was forcibly disbanded by the Korean government in December 1898.[^16]

Seo's Catholic philanthropy became legendary in Daegu. He donated land and contributed vast sums of money to build churches, first constructing a temporary church and then financing the construction of the magnificent Gyesan Cathedral in 1897, which still stands as a landmark of Daegu today.[^17] He donated the sites for Daegu Cathedral Church, the bishop's house, office, seminary, and houses for missionaries.[^18] When asked to help Daegu Diocese grow and expand with land and financial support, Seo famously declared: "All my property belongs to God and the Blessed Mother. I intend to donate the money I have accumulated to the Church."[^19]

In January 1906, Seo co-founded Gwangmunsa (廣文社), the largest publication and printing office in Daegu, with the purpose of educating the people.[^20] Kim Gwang-je served as president of Gwangmunsa, while Seo served as vice-president.[^21] This publishing house would become the launching point for the most significant achievement of Seo's life: the National Debt Repayment Movement.

## Major Achievements

### The National Debt Repayment Movement (1907-1908)

Seo Sang-don's most significant achievement was initiating and leading the National Debt Repayment Movement (국채보상운동), one of the most remarkable grassroots patriotic movements in Korean history. By 1907, Korea had accumulated a crushing national debt of 13 million won to Japan—equivalent to the Korean Empire's entire annual budget.[^22] Following the establishment of the Residency-General in 1906, predatory loans were issued under pretexts of improving education, expanding financial institutions, and hiring Japanese officials, causing Korea's debt to balloon over just two years.[^23]

On January 29, 1907, at a meeting at Daegu Gwangmunsa (currently Jung-gu Soochang Park), Seo Sang-don, as vice-president of the organization, made a historic proposal: if 20 million Korean citizens would stop smoking for three months and contribute 20 jeon each, they could raise the 13 million won needed to repay the national debt and restore national sovereignty.[^24] To demonstrate his commitment, Seo personally donated 800 won—an enormous sum at the time—and participants at that meeting raised 2,000 won that very day.[^25] The movement officially launched on January 30, 1907, with the first public assembly held on February 21 at Bukhujeong (Daegu Citizen Hall).[^26]

The movement attracted unprecedented national appeal and quickly became a mass phenomenon that transcended all social divisions. For the first time in Korean history, the movement succeeded in unifying Koreans based on patriotism irrespective of socioeconomic status, gender, caste, and creed.[^27] The campaign began as a male-centered drive to stop smoking, but within just two days, women in the Daegu region formed their own organization, declaring "There is no distinction between men and women in loving one's country," and started by donating the jewelry they were wearing.[^28] Women throughout the country responded in various ways, saving money from their budgets for rice and groceries, and even cutting and selling their hair.[^29]

One of the most remarkable participants was Aengmu, a famous kisaeng (traditional female entertainer) of Daegu who donated 100 won to the cause in 1907, explaining that "it was inappropriate for her to donate more than a man; but if a man donated more, she would also donate more, even unto death."[^30] This may be regarded as the first stirrings of a women's mass movement in Korea, which deserves attention considering that the first feminist movement in the United States started in 1908.[^31] Even beggars and thieves gave what little they had to the national cause.[^32]

The movement spread like wildfire across Korea and even reached overseas Korean communities in Japan and America.[^33] The movement was most active from April to December 1907, with the most donations collected between June and August of that year.[^34] At its peak in 1908, the movement had amassed between 160,000 and 190,000 won according to historian Jeong Jin-seok—a substantial amount representing approximately 1.5% of the country's total debt.[^35] Newspapers across the country, especially The Korea Daily News (대한매일신보) run by Yang Gi-tak and British journalist Ernest Bethell, provided extensive coverage that helped spread the movement nationwide.[^36]

### Educational and Religious Contributions

Beyond the National Debt Repayment Movement, Seo Sang-don made lasting contributions to education during a critical period when Korea desperately needed modernization. In 1908, he established a Chinese reading school called Haesongjae, which he renamed Seonglip School (成立學校).[^37] Two years later, in 1910, he opened another Seonglip School specifically for girls—a highly progressive move at a time when women's education was not widely promoted in Korea.[^38] These schools represented Seo's forward-thinking approach to education and his belief in the importance of educating both genders.

Seo's contributions to the Catholic Church in Daegu were equally significant. He is hailed as one of the pioneers who played crucial roles in the advent and growth of the Catholic Church in Daegu, alongside Bishop Florian Demange (1887-1938), a French missionary who served as the archdiocese's first bishop.[^39] His donations of land, money, and personal effort helped establish Daegu as a bastion of Catholicism in the southwestern Korean Peninsula, which today has approximately 492,000 Catholics.[^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Movement's Failure and Japanese Suppression

Despite its inspiring start and widespread participation, the National Debt Repayment Movement ultimately failed to achieve its primary objective of repaying Korea's debt to Japan. The movement's failure was not due to lack of Korean patriotism or participation, but rather to deliberate and systematic Japanese suppression designed to crush Korean nationalist sentiment.[^41]

Startled by the enthusiasm and rapid spread of the movement, the Japanese Residency-General implemented a series of measures to destroy it. In July 1907, Japanese authorities enacted the press law and security law to constrain the Korean press and prohibit assembly and association.[^42] These laws effectively silenced the newspapers that had been promoting the movement and prevented Koreans from organizing further fundraising activities.

The most devastating blow came in 1908 when Japanese authorities orchestrated false charges against the movement's leaders. In May 1908, Ernest Bethell, the British journalist who had championed the movement through The Korea Daily News, was arrested.[^43] In July 1908, Yang Gi-tak, editor-in-chief and co-founder of the newspaper and a leader of the debt repayment campaign, was arrested on fabricated embezzlement charges, accused of stealing 30,000 won from donations.[^44] The Japanese prosecutor at Yang's trial later confessed that he did not find the evidence against Yang to be convincing and hoped that Yang would be found innocent.[^45] Both men were eventually proven innocent and released due to lack of evidence, but by that time, the movement had been significantly weakened and public confidence had been shaken.[^46]

Ultimately, most of the funds that had been raised—close to 200,000 won—were either absorbed into various institutions or confiscated by the Japanese government after Japan forcibly annexed Korea in August 1910.[^47] The movement represents a tragic example of how Japanese colonial authorities used legal manipulation, false accusations, and outright theft to suppress Korean nationalism and maintain control.

### Limitations of the Approach

Some historical analysts have questioned whether the movement's strategy was realistic. With only 1.5% of the total debt raised at its peak, the mathematical impossibility of reaching the 13 million won goal through individual small donations became apparent.[^48] Critics argue that the movement, while noble in intention and remarkable in its ability to unite Koreans, was ultimately a symbolic gesture rather than a practical solution to Korea's economic subjugation.

Others have noted that the movement focused on addressing the symptoms (the debt) rather than the underlying structural problems of Japanese imperialism and Korea's weakening political sovereignty. By the time the movement began in 1907, Japan had already established the Residency-General and was tightening its grip on Korean governance. Some historians argue that resources and energy might have been better directed toward more direct forms of political resistance.

## Personal Life

Seo Sang-don married and had multiple children, though specific details about his wife's name and the exact number of children are not extensively documented in available sources.[^49] His descendants continued to live in Korea, with family photographs from the 1930s and 1940s showing the extended Seo family in Daegu.[^50] One of his children became the great-grandfather of descendants who preserve his memory today.[^51]

Despite his enormous wealth and high social standing, Seo was known for maintaining humility and living simply. Bishop Florian Demange, who attended Seo's funeral, captured this aspect of his character perfectly when he called Seo "a great fellow and extraordinary craftsman who remained an ordinary man despite being rich."[^52] This ability to remain grounded despite accumulating substantial fortune distinguished Seo from many other wealthy merchants of his era.

Seo's Catholic faith was central to his identity throughout his life. As a third or fourth-generation Catholic from a family of martyrs, his faith was not merely cultural but deeply personal and costly. He devoted himself to thrift, missionary work, and volunteer activities while never forgetting the sacrifices his uncles and ancestors had made for their religious convictions.[^53] His life evolved around two intertwined missions: living and spreading the Catholic faith, and restoring national spirit and pride.[^54]

When Seo died in Seoul on June 30, 1913, at the age of 64, he was surrounded by his family.[^55] Bishop Demange attended his funeral and paid homage, writing in his diary, "We are very grateful to him."[^56] He was buried with honors befitting his status as both a prominent Catholic leader and a patriot who had dedicated his wealth and energy to the cause of Korean independence.

## Legacy

Seo Sang-don's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, continuing to inspire Koreans more than a century after his death. He remains a national hero to Koreans and is recognized as a pioneer of the Daegu Archdiocese.[^57] The Korean government posthumously awarded him the Order of Merit for National Foundation (Patriotic Class) in 1999, officially recognizing his contributions to Korean independence and national identity.[^58]

In celebration of Seo's leadership and sacrifices, the City of Daegu has undertaken several initiatives to preserve his memory. In 2008, Seo's old house in Jung-gu district of Daegu, where he lived and worked, was restored and opened as a museum that attracts many visitors.[^59] The house serves as a tangible connection to Seo's life and the era in which he lived. The city also built the National Debt Repayment Park (국채보상운동기념공원) and erected a statue of Seo in his honor.[^60] A National Debt Redemption Movement Memorial Museum opened in the park in 2011.[^61]

Perhaps the most significant recognition of Seo's work came in 2017, when the records and documents of the National Debt Repayment Movement were inscribed in UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme.[^62] This international recognition affirmed the movement's historical significance as a grassroots patriotic movement that transcended social divisions and represented one of the earliest examples of mass civic participation in Korean history. The UNESCO inscription ensures that the story of Seo Sang-don and the millions of Koreans who contributed to the movement will be preserved and remembered globally.

The schools Seo established also contributed to his lasting legacy. The Seonglip Schools for boys and girls represented his commitment to education as a foundation for national strength and individual empowerment. His progressive decision to establish a girls' school in 1910 was particularly remarkable for that era and demonstrated his belief in gender equality in education.[^63]

Gyesan Cathedral, which Seo helped fund and build in 1897, remains one of Daegu's most iconic religious and architectural landmarks, serving as a physical testament to Seo's devotion to his faith and his community.[^64] The cathedral continues to serve the Catholic community more than 120 years after its construction, a living legacy of Seo's vision and generosity.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians widely praise Seo Sang-don as an exemplary figure who combined deep religious faith with practical patriotism and civic responsibility. His ability to mobilize millions of Koreans across all social classes represents a remarkable achievement in grassroots organizing, especially in an era when Korean society was still highly stratified by class and gender.[^65] The National Debt Repayment Movement is studied as one of the earliest examples of mass civic participation in Korean history and as a precursor to later independence movements, including the March 1st Movement of 1919.[^66]

Catholic historians particularly celebrate Seo as a model of how faith can inspire social action and national service. Despite coming from a family that suffered persecution and martyrdom for their Catholic beliefs, Seo channeled his faith into constructive efforts to build churches, establish schools, and serve his community.[^67] His statement that "all my property belongs to God and the Blessed Mother" reflects a theology of stewardship that contrasts sharply with the accumulation-focused mentality of many wealthy individuals.[^68]

Bishop Demange's assessment of Seo as someone who "remained an ordinary man despite being rich" has been widely quoted as capturing an essential quality of Seo's character: his humility and refusal to let wealth corrupt his values or distance him from ordinary people.[^69] This virtue made Seo an effective leader of a mass movement, as people from all backgrounds felt he genuinely represented their interests rather than using the movement for personal gain.

Some scholars have compared Seo's National Debt Repayment Movement to Mahatma Gandhi's social movements in India, noting similarities in their emphasis on mass participation, symbolic sacrifice (giving up smoking parallel to Gandhi's salt march), and economic resistance to colonialism.[^70] Both leaders understood the power of mobilizing ordinary citizens to take small but meaningful actions that collectively represented defiance of imperial control.

Modern Korean progressives and democracy activists see Seo as an early champion of grassroots democracy and civic participation. The movement he led demonstrated that ordinary Koreans, including women and people of lower social classes, could exercise agency and contribute to national affairs—a revolutionary concept in early 20th-century Korea.[^71] The fact that women organized themselves within days of the movement's launch and that kisaeng, beggars, and thieves all participated shows how the movement broke down traditional social barriers.[^72]

### Negative Views

While Seo Sang-don is widely celebrated, some historians have offered more critical assessments of his strategies and the movement he led. Critics note that the mathematical reality of raising 13 million won through individual small donations from a population of 20 million was always implausible, suggesting that the movement was more symbolic than practical.[^73] By focusing energy and resources on an ultimately futile fundraising campaign, critics argue, Korean nationalists may have missed opportunities for more effective forms of resistance.

Some analysts question whether the movement's emphasis on individual moral reform (quitting smoking) and voluntary financial sacrifice was an adequate response to the structural violence and political domination of Japanese imperialism. By framing the solution to Korea's crisis as individual Korean behavior change rather than collective political resistance, the movement may have inadvertently deflected attention from the need for more radical anti-colonial action.[^74]

Certain historians also note that despite the movement's egalitarian rhetoric, it was still led primarily by male elites like Seo Sang-don and Kim Gwang-je, and the organizational structure reflected traditional hierarchies. While women's participation was remarkable and unprecedented, women were not given leadership roles equivalent to men, suggesting limits to the movement's progressive character.[^75]

From a more conservative nationalist perspective, some have criticized Seo and other movement leaders for being too conciliatory toward Japanese authorities and too willing to work within the legal frameworks imposed by the Residency-General. More radical independence activists favored armed resistance or revolutionary action rather than peaceful fundraising campaigns.[^76] In this view, the movement's failure was not only due to Japanese suppression but also to its inherently moderate, reformist approach.

Finally, some scholars have pointed out that the movement did not adequately address the underlying causes of Korea's debt and economic vulnerability, such as government corruption, inefficient taxation systems, and the unequal treaties that Japan had imposed on Korea. Without fundamental political and economic reforms, simply paying off one round of debt would not have prevented future indebtedness or Japanese domination.[^77]

Despite these criticisms, even skeptical historians generally acknowledge Seo Sang-don's sincerity, generosity, and genuine patriotism, and recognize the National Debt Repayment Movement as a significant moment in Korean national consciousness, even if it did not achieve its stated goals.
