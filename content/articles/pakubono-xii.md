## Summary

Pakubuwono XII (born Raden Mas Soerjo Goeritno) was the eleventh Susuhunan (ruler) of Surakarta and the longest-reigning monarch in Surakarta history, ruling for 59 years from 1945 until his death in 2004.[^1] Ascending to the throne at age 20 during the final months of Japanese occupation, he became the first Javanese monarch to rule in Indonesia's independence era, earning him the nickname "Sinuhun Hamardika."[^2] Despite his early support for Indonesian independence—including military action against Japanese forces and donating half his royal wealth to the Republic—his political influence waned dramatically after radical republican forces kidnapped him in 1946 and abolished Surakarta's special administrative status.[^3] Throughout his six-decade reign spanning the Japanese occupation, Sukarno era, and Suharto's New Order, Pakubuwono XII maintained his role as a patron of Javanese culture, though his political legacy remains overshadowed by his contemporary, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Raden Mas Soerjo Goeritno was born on April 14, 1925, in Surakarta (Solo), Central Java, the son of Pakubuwono XI and his queen consort, Kanjeng Raden Ayu Koesparijah (styled Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Pakubuwono).[^5] Despite being the youngest son of Pakubuwono XI, he was designated as heir apparent due to Javanese succession rules that prioritized sons born to the official queen consort over older sons born to other consorts.[^6] This privileged position in the royal family afforded him access to both traditional Javanese and modern Dutch colonial education.

During his childhood, the young prince demonstrated a strong affinity for Javanese cultural traditions. He was particularly fond of studying Javanese classical dances, especially the Handaga and Garuda dances, which were considered among the most prestigious forms of court dance.[^7] His religious education included regular Quranic recitation sessions with Mr. Tjondrowijoto, a teacher from Mambaul Ulum, reflecting the Islamic traditions of the Surakarta court.[^8] He also practiced archery, a traditional aristocratic pursuit that connected him to the warrior heritage of the Javanese nobility.

His formal education followed the Dutch colonial system. In 1938, when he was just 13 years old, his education was interrupted for five months when he was required to accompany his father and other local monarchs from the Dutch East Indies to the Netherlands to attend the 40th jubilee of Queen Wilhelmina's coronation.[^9] This trip exposed the young prince to European royal traditions and the broader Dutch colonial network that governed the Indonesian archipelago. Upon returning to Java, he continued his secondary education at the Hogereburgerschool te Bandoeng (now SMA Negeri 3 Bandung and SMA Negeri 5 Bandung), studying alongside some of his uncles.[^10]

However, world events would again disrupt his education. After studying in Bandung for two years, the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941 and the subsequent Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies in 1942 forced significant changes in his life.[^11] When the Dutch colonial administration fell to the Empire of Japan, Pakubuwono XI ordered his son to leave Bandung and return to Surakarta for safety.[^12] This decision would prove fateful, as the young prince would soon find himself thrust into leadership far earlier than anyone had anticipated.

The Japanese occupation period (1942-1945) brought severe economic hardship to the Surakarta court. Inflation devastated royal and noble finances, and the Japanese colonial administration confiscated most of the court's assets, which contributed to Pakubuwono XI's declining health.[^13] When Pakubuwono XI died on June 1, 1945, just months before Japan's surrender, the 20-year-old Raden Mas Soerjo Goeritno became heir to a throne that had been stripped of much of its material wealth and political power, ruling a kingdom under foreign occupation with an uncertain future.

## Rise to Power

The coronation of Pakubuwono XII took place on June 11, 1945, under extraordinary circumstances that would profoundly shape his reign.[^14] At just 20 years old, he was crowned Susuhunan during the final weeks of Japanese occupation, approximately two months before Indonesia's declaration of independence on August 17, 1945.[^15] The Japanese colonial government initially opposed his coronation, ominously stating that "they didn't dare to guarantee the safety of future king," reflecting the political instability and uncertainty of the period.[^16] Despite these concerns, the coronation proceeded according to Javanese royal tradition, though in a significantly diminished material context compared to previous successions.

Following Javanese tradition, Raden Mas Soerjo Goeritno did not attend his father's funeral at the royal cemetery in Imogiri, as heirs were prohibited from attending their predecessor's funeral ceremonies.[^17] This absence served as public confirmation of his status as the legitimate successor. Due to his young age and limited political experience, he was often accompanied and advised by his mother, GKR. Pakubuwono (popularly known as Ibu Ageng or "Great Mother"), in carrying out his daily duties during the early months of his reign.[^18] His selection as Susuhunan was partly based on his youth and perceived ability to adapt to the rapidly changing political situation.[^19]

The end of World War II came just weeks after his coronation, when Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945, followed by Indonesia's proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945. Pakubuwono XII quickly recognized the significance of this moment and positioned himself as a supporter of the nascent Republic of Indonesia. On September 1, 1945—just four days before Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX and Paku Alam VIII of Yogyakarta issued their famous decree—Pakubuwono XII and Mangkunegara VIII separately issued royal decrees congratulating the newly founded Republic of Indonesia and declaring their territories part of the new nation.[^20] This early support earned Pakubuwono XII the title "Sinuhun Hamardika" (the Susuhunan of Independence), as he became the first Susuhunan of Surakarta to reign during Indonesia's independence era.[^21]

In recognition of this support, President Sukarno declared Surakarta a Special Region (Daerah Istimewa) with Pakubuwono XII continuing as governor, similar to the arrangement granted to Yogyakarta.[^22] This appeared to secure both his political authority and the traditional privileges of the Surakarta court. Pakubuwono XII was also awarded a titular military rank of lieutenant-general from President Sukarno, a distinction that meant he often accompanied the president to observe battlefields during the Indonesian War of Independence.[^23]

His most dramatic military action came on October 12-13, 1945, when Pakubuwono XII personally led assaults on Japanese military installations in Surakarta. He commanded attacks on the headquarters of the Kenpeitai (Japanese military police) in Kemlayan and Timuran, as well as on the headquarters of the Kido Butai (a Japanese military unit) in Mangkubumen.[^24] These actions demonstrated his commitment to Indonesian independence and his willingness to take direct military action, establishing him as more than merely a ceremonial figure during the revolution's early days.

However, this promising beginning would be short-lived. The young Susuhunan's political inexperience and the radical republican climate of revolutionary Surakarta would soon undermine his authority and fundamentally alter the nature of his reign.

## Major Achievements

Despite the political challenges that would soon overwhelm him, Pakubuwono XII made several significant contributions to Indonesian independence and established a legacy as one of the longest-reigning monarchs in Javanese history. His major achievements centered on material support for independence, military action during the revolution, and cultural patronage spanning nearly six decades.

**Support for Indonesian Independence**

Pakubuwono XII's most substantial contribution to the Indonesian Republic came through his material and financial sacrifices. He voluntarily donated half of his personal and royal wealth to the central government during the early years of Indonesian independence.[^25] This represented an enormous sacrifice for a court that had already been impoverished by Japanese confiscation of assets during the occupation. The donations included valuable assets such as sedan cars, dozens of riding horses, and various other valuable goods dedicated to public interests.[^26] The horse used by General Sudirman during his famous guerrilla warfare to defend independence came from the Surakarta court.[^27] 

Beyond transportation assets, Pakubuwono XII sacrificed palace wealth including gold and weaponry to support the national struggle, causing the palace itself to experience severe financial deficit.[^28] The extent of his donations was so complete that Pakubuwono XII did not have a personal car until Indonesia achieved full sovereignty.[^29] For his dedication to Indonesia, he was awarded a certificate of appreciation and the Independence Struggle Medal of '45 (Medali Pejoang Kemerdekaan '45) by the National Daily Council of the '45 Generation in Jakarta, recognizing his loyalty to the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia and his deep nationalism during the independence struggle.[^30]

**Military Leadership and Recognition**

Pakubuwono XII received recognition for being the first king in Indonesia to swear allegiance and stand behind the republic government in the early independence era.[^31] His military rank of lieutenant-general, though titular, gave him official standing within the republican military structure and demonstrated the integration of traditional Javanese authority with the modern Indonesian state.[^32] His participation in military actions, particularly the October 1945 assaults on Japanese installations, showed that he was willing to risk personal danger for the independence cause.[^33] Both Hamengkubuwono IX and Pakubuwono XII received the title of Panglima Besar T.K.R. (Supreme Commander of the People's Security Army) for their services in leading T.K.R. troops.[^34]

**Longest Reign in Surakarta History**

Pakubuwono XII holds the distinction of being the longest-ruling monarch in the entire history of Surakarta, reigning for 59 years from 1945 until his death in 2004.[^35] This extraordinary tenure meant he ruled through three distinct political eras: the Japanese occupation (briefly at the end), the Sukarno era (1945-1966), and the Suharto New Order (1966-1998), as well as the early Reform Era (1998-2004).[^36] Each of these periods presented different challenges to traditional Javanese power, which was alternately respected and challenged by Indonesia's evolving political systems. His ability to maintain his position through these dramatic political transformations—from colonial occupation to revolutionary independence to authoritarian developmentalism to democratic reform—demonstrated remarkable political adaptability and institutional resilience.

**Cultural Patronage**

Although Pakubuwono XII was politically less successful than his contemporary Hamengkubuwono IX, he remained an important patron figure of Javanese culture throughout his long reign.[^37] The Surakarta court under his leadership continued its historical role in preserving and developing courtly Javanese palace dance, gamelan music, and other traditional arts.[^38] Since childhood he had demonstrated passion for Javanese classical dances, and this personal interest translated into continued royal support for cultural practitioners.[^39] In the reformation era, many national figures, such as President Abdurrahman Wahid (Gus Dur), still respected Pakubuwono XII as an elder of Java, recognizing his cultural significance even as his political power had long since diminished.[^40]

**Educational Pursuits**

After the loss of Surakarta's special status and his failed attempt to restore it in 1952, Pakubuwono XII left the palace to attend education in Jakarta in 1954, demonstrating his recognition of the need for continued learning and adaptation to Indonesia's changing society.[^41] This pursuit of education while serving as Susuhunan reflected his understanding that traditional authority needed to be complemented by modern knowledge.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The reign of Pakubuwono XII, despite its extraordinary length, was marked by significant political failures and criticisms that diminished his historical standing, particularly in comparison to Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta. The controversies surrounding his rule reveal both the limitations of his personal leadership and the structural challenges facing traditional monarchy in revolutionary Indonesia.

**Political Ineffectiveness and Loss of Special Status**

From the outset of his reign, Pakubuwono XII was viewed as a ruler who failed to effectively leverage the political situation of Indonesia, which caused his prestige to be significantly lower than that of Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta.[^42] Scholarly assessments have been harsh. One characterization described him as "completely inexperienced, without interest in political activities, indeed in anything except his personal pleasures," though the specific source of this quote requires verification.[^43] Whether or not this assessment is entirely fair, it reflects the perception that the young Susuhunan lacked the political acumen needed to navigate Indonesia's revolutionary period.

The most dramatic demonstration of his political weakness came in early 1946. In January 1946, Pakubuwono XII, his mother, and other royal family members were kidnapped by the Barisan Banteng (Ox Front), a radical republican paramilitary group led by Muwardi.[^44] They were only freed after making a statement of regret, and his royal title was symbolically equalized with Republican leaders by addressing him as "Bung" (comrade)—a popular revolutionary form of address that stripped away the traditional honorific distance of monarchy.[^45] This humiliation demonstrated the vulnerability of traditional authority in the face of radical republican ideology.

The situation deteriorated further when on April 19, 1946, Barisan Banteng stormed the palace, demanding that Pakubuwono XII surrender his power to the people.[^46] Facing continued pressure and unable to resist the radical republican movement, Pakubuwono XII dissolved the self-governing region on April 30, 1946.[^47] On June 16, 1946, the Surakarta "special region" was officially abolished and replaced with a regency (kabupaten), administered by a republican government outside the control of the Susuhunan and his court.[^48] From June 1, 1946, onward, the government was held by civilians, while Pakubuwono XII became merely symbolic, stripped of real political authority.[^49]

The loss of Surakarta's special status stood in stark contrast to Yogyakarta, which maintained its special administrative status—a distinction that survives to this day. The Special Region of Surakarta lasted only one year (August 1945 - July 1946), while the Special Region of Yogyakarta has endured for nearly eight decades.[^50] This dramatic difference in outcomes reflected poorly on Pakubuwono XII's political capabilities.

**Protected by Military Rivals**

Adding insult to injury, the radical forces that undermined Pakubuwono XII's authority were protected by General Sudirman, the commander of the Indonesian Armed Forces. Barisan Banteng successfully took control of Surakarta without being eradicated by the Indonesian government due to General Sudirman's protection.[^51] General Sudirman even successfully persuaded the government to permanently abolish the special status of Surakarta.[^52] As Yogyakarta became the capital of the Republic during the revolution, Surakarta—historically its rival—became a center of opposition to the government, and Pakubuwono XII was caught in the middle of these political currents without the skill to navigate them.[^53]

**Failed Attempt to Restore Special Status**

Pakubuwono XII did attempt to regain the special status of Surakarta. On January 15, 1952, he made an extensive explanation about the Special Region of Surakarta to the ministerial council in Jakarta, arguing that the government of the special region couldn't overcome unrest and threats, while the government didn't have adequate power apparatus.[^54] However, this attempt was unsuccessful, representing another political failure in his reign.[^55] The continued rejection of Surakarta's special status aspirations—which has remained a sensitive political issue even into the 2020s—can be traced to this early failure to maintain the status initially granted in 1945.

**Succession Crisis and Lack of Clear Heir**

Pakubuwono XII's failure to formally appoint a queen consort throughout his entire 59-year reign created a succession crisis that tarnished his legacy.[^56] Upon his death in 2004, there was no clear heir as there was no official queen installed, and he had left 15 sons and 20 daughters born to different mothers without establishing a clear succession order.[^57] This failure of royal planning resulted in two of his half-brother sons—KGPH Hangabehi and KGPH Tedjowulan—claiming the throne and creating a bitter eight-year succession dispute that included violence and competing coronations.[^58] Both sons separately held funerals for their father, highlighting the divided nature of the royal family.[^59] The succession dispute was only resolved in 2012 when Tedjowulan finally acknowledged Hangabehi as the legitimate Pakubuwono XIII.[^60]

**Comparison to Hamengkubuwono IX**

Perhaps the most damning criticism of Pakubuwono XII comes from the constant comparison to Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta, his contemporary. While both issued declarations of support for Indonesian independence in September 1945, Hamengkubuwono IX was described as "intelligent, broad-minded, and nationalist-spirited," and he successfully maintained Yogyakarta's special status, served as vice president of Indonesia, and became one of the most respected figures in Indonesian history.[^61] Pakubuwono XII, in contrast, lost his special status within months, was reduced to a ceremonial figurehead, and is remembered more for what he failed to preserve than for what he achieved.[^62]

---

## Personal Life

Pakubuwono XII's personal life reflected both his deep connection to Javanese cultural traditions and the unconventional choices that would create lasting complications for his family and legacy. Unlike previous Susuhunan who maintained clearly defined royal households with officially designated queen consorts, Pakubuwono XII never formally appointed a queen consort throughout his entire 59-year reign—a decision that would prove consequential for the succession.[^63]

**Family Structure and Relationships**

Throughout his life, Pakubuwono XII maintained relationships with multiple women, referred to in Javanese court terminology as selir (consorts or concubines), but never elevated any of them to the formal status of queen consort (Ratu).[^64] This decision, whether intentional or the result of prolonged indecision, was highly unusual for a monarch with such a long reign. His father, Pakubuwono XI, had formally appointed Kanjeng Raden Ayu Koesparijah as queen consort, establishing a clear line of succession that made the young Soerjo Goeritno the heir despite being the youngest son.[^65] By contrast, Pakubuwono XII's failure to replicate this formal structure created ambiguity about succession.

The two most prominent mothers of his children were KRAy Pradapaningrum, who bore his eldest son KGPH Hangabehi (born Gusti Raden Mas Suryadi, later changed to Gusti Raden Mas Surya Pratana, born June 28, 1948), and KRay Retnadiningrum, who bore KGPH Tedjowulan.[^66] In total, Pakubuwono XII fathered 15 sons and 20 daughters with various consorts, creating a large and complex extended royal family.[^67] The absence of a formal hierarchy among these relationships meant that all the children had claims to various degrees of royal status, but no clear precedence for succession to the throne.

**Cultural and Spiritual Practices**

Pakubuwono XII maintained strong connections to Javanese spiritual and cultural practices throughout his life. From childhood, he demonstrated passion for Javanese classical dances, particularly the Handaga and Garuda dances, and this interest continued throughout his reign as he served as patron of Surakarta's court arts.[^68] He practiced regular Quranic recitation, reflecting the Islamic traditions of the Surakarta court, which blended Javanese mysticism (kejawen) with Islamic practice.[^69]

One of the few direct quotes attributed to Pakubuwono XII reveals his spiritual philosophy: "Apa isi mengheningkan cipta secara pribadi itu yang selalu harus dicari" (What fills personal meditation is what must always be sought).[^70] This statement reflects the contemplative aspect of Javanese kingship, where the ruler was expected to maintain spiritual discipline as a source of authority. References to his spiritual practices indicate that he engaged in mati raga (ascetic fasting and meditation), a traditional practice among Javanese nobility aimed at achieving spiritual power and self-discipline.[^71]

**Personality and Character**

Contemporary assessments of Pakubuwono XII's personality suggest a man selected for his adaptability and youth rather than for strong leadership qualities.[^72] Due to his young age at accession, he was "often accompanied by his mother, GKR. Pakubuwono (popularly known as Ibu Ageng or Great Mother), in carrying out his daily duties," suggesting he may have been somewhat dependent on advisors and family members.[^73] His decision to pursue further education in Jakarta in 1954, after his failed attempt to restore Surakarta's special status, indicates self-awareness about his limitations and a desire for continued personal development.[^74]

**Later Years and Respect as Cultural Elder**

In his later years, despite having lost political power decades earlier, Pakubuwono XII maintained cultural significance as a Javanese elder. In the reformation era following Suharto's fall in 1998, national figures such as President Abdurrahman Wahid continued to respect Pakubuwono XII as an elder of Java (sesepuh), acknowledging his symbolic importance in maintaining Javanese cultural continuity even without political authority.[^75] This respect reflected the enduring power of Javanese cultural traditions and the separation between political power and cultural authority in post-independence Indonesia.

**Death and Funeral**

Pakubuwono XII fell into a coma and underwent intensive care at Panti Kosala Dr. Oen Hospital in Surakarta before being pronounced dead on June 11, 2004, exactly 59 years after his coronation.[^76] He was buried at Imogiri, the traditional burial place for Javanese royalty.[^77] However, even his death became a source of family division. Due to the succession dispute between his sons Hangabehi and Tedjowulan, both sons separately held funeral ceremonies for their father—an unprecedented and unfortunate situation that highlighted the family dysfunction resulting from his failure to establish clear succession plans.[^78]

---

## Legacy

The legacy of Pakubuwono XII is complex and contested, marked by the tension between his extraordinary longevity as ruler and his limited political effectiveness. His 59-year reign—the longest in Surakarta history—spanned some of the most transformative decades in Indonesian history, yet his impact on those transformations was minimal after the first year of his rule.[^79] Understanding his legacy requires examining both what he represented symbolically and what he failed to achieve politically.

**Symbolic Continuity Through Political Transformation**

Pakubuwono XII's primary legacy lies in his role as a symbol of continuity during Indonesia's dramatic political transitions. He reigned under Japanese occupation, through the revolutionary independence period, during Sukarno's Guided Democracy, throughout Suharto's authoritarian New Order, and into the democratic Reform Era.[^80] Each of these periods challenged traditional Javanese royal authority in different ways, yet Pakubuwono XII maintained his position, even if only as a ceremonial figurehead after 1946. This persistence itself represents a form of success—the survival of traditional monarchy within a modern republic that had every ideological reason to eliminate such institutions entirely.

In this sense, Pakubuwono XII served as a living bridge between Java's royal past and Indonesia's republican present. His presence provided cultural continuity for those who valued Javanese traditions, even as real power shifted entirely to republican institutions. The respect shown to him by national leaders like Abdurrahman Wahid demonstrated that Indonesia could accommodate traditional cultural forms within its modern political structure.[^81]

**The Shadow of Comparison**

However, Pakubuwono XII's legacy is inevitably overshadowed by the comparison to Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX of Yogyakarta. Both men were crowned within months of each other in 1940 and 1945 respectively, both declared support for Indonesian independence in September 1945, and both were initially granted special administrative status for their territories.[^82] Yet their paths diverged dramatically. Hamengkubuwono IX became vice president of Indonesia, maintained Yogyakarta's special status (which continues today), and is remembered as one of Indonesia's great statesmen.[^83] Pakubuwono XII lost Surakarta's special status within a year, became a ceremonial figure, and is remembered primarily for his political failures.[^84]

This comparison has shaped how Pakubuwono XII is remembered in Indonesian historiography and popular memory. Where Hamengkubuwono IX represents successful adaptation of traditional authority to modern republicanism, Pakubuwono XII represents failed adaptation—a cautionary tale about the vulnerability of traditional power in revolutionary times.

**Cultural Patronage and Preservation**

Despite political marginalization, Pakubuwono XII maintained significant legacy as a patron of Javanese culture. The Surakarta court under his stewardship continued its centuries-old role in preserving and developing courtly Javanese arts, including dance, gamelan music, wayang (shadow puppetry), and batik textile arts.[^85] The court remained a center for classical Javanese performing arts and a repository of cultural knowledge throughout the twentieth century. For artists, dancers, musicians, and cultural practitioners, Pakubuwono XII's court provided institutional support and legitimacy, helping to preserve traditions that might otherwise have been lost during Indonesia's rapid modernization.

This cultural legacy has lasting significance. Surakarta (Solo) remains one of Indonesia's major cultural centers, renowned for its traditional arts, and this status owes much to the continuous royal patronage provided throughout Pakubuwono XII's long reign. The palace continues to be a tourist attraction and cultural site, maintaining its role in Javanese cultural life even as its political relevance has vanished.

**The Succession Crisis and Institutional Weakness**

One of the most problematic aspects of Pakubuwono XII's legacy was the succession crisis he created through his failure to formally appoint a queen consort or clearly designate an heir.[^86] The eight-year dispute between his sons Hangabehi and Tedjowulan, which included violence and competing claims, damaged the institution of the Surakarta monarchy and revealed its internal weaknesses.[^87] This crisis stood in contrast to the relatively smooth succession in Yogyakarta, further emphasizing the comparative institutional strength of Hamengkubuwono IX's legacy versus Pakubuwono XII's.

The eventual resolution in 2012, when Tedjowulan acknowledged Hangabehi as Pakubuwono XIII, restored a degree of stability, but the damage to the institution's prestige had been done.[^88] When Pakubuwono XIII died in late 2004, another succession dispute emerged, suggesting that the institutional problems were not fully resolved.[^89] These recurring crises reflect poorly on Pakubuwono XII's stewardship of the monarchy and his failure to establish clear succession protocols.

**Historical Assessment and Memory**

In Indonesian historical memory, Pakubuwono XII occupies a minor role compared to other independence-era figures. Academic research on his reign exists, particularly in Indonesian-language scholarship, but he is not a major figure in Indonesian historiography.[^90] His early support for independence and material contributions are recognized and earned him the Independence Struggle Medal, but these achievements are overshadowed by his subsequent political marginalization.[^91]

The enduring question surrounding Pakubuwono XII's legacy is whether his political failures resulted from personal inadequacy or from structural impossibility. Could any ruler of Surakarta have successfully navigated the radical republican politics of 1945-1946, or was the loss of special status inevitable given the strong anti-monarchical sentiments in Surakarta? The fact that Hamengkubuwono IX succeeded in similar circumstances suggests that personal leadership mattered, yet the different political cultures of Surakarta and Yogyakarta also played a role.

**Attempts to Restore Special Status**

An interesting aspect of Pakubuwono XII's legacy is the recurring question of Surakarta's special status. His failed 1952 attempt to restore special administrative status was not the end of this issue.[^92] Discussions about re-establishing the Special Region of Surakarta have resurfaced periodically, most recently in mid-April 2025, when the matter was raised in meetings of the Indonesian Parliament's Commission II with the Ministry of Home Affairs.[^93] These continuing discussions reflect unresolved questions about the relationship between traditional authority and modern governance in Java—questions that Pakubuwono XII was unable to answer satisfactorily during his reign.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters of Pakubuwono XII emphasize several aspects of his reign that deserve recognition and positive assessment, focusing primarily on his contributions during Indonesia's struggle for independence and his role as a cultural custodian across six decades.

**Recognition as Independence Supporter**

Academic research, particularly in Indonesian scholarship, has documented Pakubuwono XII's significant contributions to Indonesian independence. The journal article "Peran Sri Susuhunan Pakubuwono XII Dalam Mempertahankan Kemerdekaan" (The Role of Sri Susuhunan Pakubuwono XII in Defending Independence) provides a scholarly examination of his support for the Republic, using verified historical sources to document his early declaration of support, military actions, and material contributions.[^94] This research highlights that he was the first king in Indonesia to swear allegiance and stand behind the republic government, an act of political courage given the uncertainty of the period.[^95]

The formal recognition he received—including the Independence Struggle Medal of '45 and the Struggle Prize from the central government—reflects official acknowledgment of his contributions.[^96] His donation of half his royal wealth, his personal leadership in military actions against Japanese forces in October 1945, and his early declaration of support for the Republic (four days before Yogyakarta's famous declaration) constitute genuine achievements that demonstrated commitment to Indonesian independence.[^97]

**Longest Reign and Institutional Continuity**

Supporters point to Pakubuwono XII's 59-year reign as evidence of remarkable political survival skills and adaptability. To maintain his position through three dramatically different political eras—Japanese occupation, revolutionary independence and Sukarno's rule, and Suharto's authoritarian New Order—required considerable diplomatic skill and flexibility.[^98] While critics characterize him as "merely symbolic" after 1946, supporters might argue that symbolic continuity itself had value, providing cultural stability during Indonesia's turbulent political transformations.

The fact that the institution of the Surakarta Sunanate survived at all when radical republican forces in 1945-1946 sought to abolish monarchy entirely could be seen as a success. Pakubuwono XII's willingness to accept reduced political status while maintaining cultural authority may have been pragmatic statesmanship rather than weakness—choosing institutional survival over futile resistance.

**Cultural Stewardship**

Perhaps the strongest positive assessment focuses on Pakubuwono XII's role as patron and preserver of Javanese culture. Despite becoming politically marginalized, he maintained the Surakarta court as a center for traditional Javanese performing arts, gamelan music, classical dance, and other cultural forms throughout his reign.[^99] His personal interest in Javanese arts from childhood through old age demonstrated authentic cultural commitment rather than mere ceremonial obligation.[^100]

The recognition he received from national leaders in the reformation era, particularly from President Abdurrahman Wahid who respected him as an elder of Java, indicates that his cultural significance transcended his political limitations.[^101] For those who value the preservation of Javanese cultural heritage, Pakubuwono XII's six decades of patronage represent an important contribution to Indonesia's cultural diversity and the survival of traditional arts in the modern era.

**Youth and Structural Constraints**

Some sympathetic assessments emphasize that Pakubuwono XII was only 20 years old when thrust into power during extraordinarily difficult circumstances—the final weeks of Japanese occupation with no preparation for the revolutionary upheaval that would follow within months.[^102] The political forces that overwhelmed him in 1946 were structural and ideological, not merely personal. The strong republican and communist movements in Surakarta, protected by General Sudirman, may have made the loss of special status inevitable regardless of who held the throne.[^103] By this interpretation, comparing him unfavorably to Hamengkubuwono IX ignores the different political contexts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta.

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of Pakubuwono XII emphasize his political ineffectiveness, poor leadership during crucial moments, and failure to secure the institutional future of the Surakarta monarchy, viewing him as a cautionary example of inadequate leadership during transformative times.

**Political Incompetence and Poor Leadership**

The most consistent criticism of Pakubuwono XII centers on his political failures and apparent lack of leadership skills. Contemporary observers and later scholars described him as inexperienced, uninterested in political activities, and focused on personal pleasures rather than governance.[^104] While the harshness of such characterizations might be debated, the results speak clearly: within one year of gaining special administrative status, he had lost it entirely, been kidnapped by radical forces, humiliated by being addressed as "Bung" (comrade) rather than by royal titles, and reduced to a symbolic figurehead.[^105]

The comparison to Hamengkubuwono IX is devastating to Pakubuwono XII's reputation. Both monarchs faced similar circumstances in 1945, yet their outcomes could not have been more different. Hamengkubuwono IX demonstrated political acumen, built strong relationships with republican leaders, positioned Yogyakarta as the capital of the Republic during the revolution, and maintained his special status for eight decades and counting.[^106] Pakubuwono XII, in contrast, lost control of his territory within months and spent the remaining 58 years of his reign as a powerless ceremonial figure. This comparison suggests that personal leadership quality mattered enormously, and Pakubuwono XII was found wanting.

**Failure to Navigate Revolutionary Politics**

Critics argue that Pakubuwono XII fundamentally misunderstood or failed to engage with the revolutionary political currents of 1945-1946. His early support for independence, while genuine, was not accompanied by the political skill necessary to maintain relevance. He was unable to build effective relationships with key republican leaders, failed to counter the radical movements in Surakarta, and could not prevent General Sudirman from supporting the abolition of Surakarta's special status.[^107] His kidnapping by Barisan Banteng and his subsequent capitulation demonstrated weakness that undermined whatever authority his royal status might have conveyed.

The unsuccessful 1952 attempt to restore Surakarta's special status further demonstrated his political limitations.[^108] By that point, six years after losing special status, any realistic chance for restoration had long passed, yet Pakubuwono XII apparently failed to understand the political reality or develop effective strategies for working within the constraints of his reduced position.

**Succession Crisis and Institutional Irresponsibility**

Perhaps the most damning criticism concerns Pakubuwono XII's failure to manage succession. After reigning for 59 years—an extraordinarily long time to make arrangements—he died without having formally appointed a queen consort or clearly designated an heir.[^109] This failure resulted in a bitter eight-year dispute between his sons that included violence, competing coronations, and separate funeral ceremonies for Pakubuwono XII himself.[^110] 

This succession crisis revealed profound institutional weakness and irresponsibility. A primary duty of any monarch is to ensure smooth succession and institutional continuity. Pakubuwono XII's failure in this regard damaged the Surakarta monarchy's prestige and created ongoing instability. When Pakubuwono XIII died in 2024/2025, another succession dispute emerged, suggesting that the institutional problems Pakubuwono XII failed to address continue to plague the Surakarta royal house.[^111]

**Overshadowed Legacy**

From a critical perspective, Pakubuwono XII's 59-year reign accomplished remarkably little beyond simple institutional survival. Unlike Hamengkubuwono IX, who served as vice president and played important roles in Indonesian politics for decades, Pakubuwono XII became politically irrelevant after 1946 and remained so for the rest of his life.[^112] His cultural patronage, while real, was essentially the passive continuation of traditions rather than active innovation or leadership.

Critical scholars view him as a symbol of failed adaptation—a traditional ruler unable to transform his authority into meaningful relevance within Indonesia's modern political system. His reign demonstrates what happens when traditional authority lacks the political skill necessary to navigate revolutionary transformation, serving as a cautionary historical example rather than a model to be emulated.
