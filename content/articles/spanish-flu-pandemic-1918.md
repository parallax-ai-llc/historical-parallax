## Overview

The 1918 Influenza Pandemic (misnamed the "Spanish Flu") was the deadliest pandemic in modern history. Caused by an H1N1 virus with avian origin, it infected 500 million people (one-third of the world's population) between 1918 and 1920. The death toll is estimated to be at least **50 million**, and possibly as high as 100 million. Unlike typical flu strains that kill the very old and very young, the 1918 flu ruthlessly killed healthy young adults (ages 20-40) by triggering a "cytokine storm" (an overreaction of the body's immune system, drowning the lungs in fluid).

## Why "Spanish" Flu?

Spain was neutral in World War I.
The warring nations (US, UK, France, Germany) censored news of the sickness to keep morale up.
Spain had no censorship. Their papers openly reported on the illness (even King Alfonso XIII got it).
So, the world assumed it started in Spain.
**True Origin:** Likely **Kansas, USA** (poultry farm near Fort Riley), or possibly a troop staging camp in Étaples, France.

## The Three Waves

### Wave 1 (Spring 1918): The Mild One
Soldiers complained of "three-day fever." Low mortality.

### Wave 2 (Fall 1918): The Killer
The virus gathered strength. It spread globally via troop ships returning from the war.
**Philadelphia Parade (Sept 28):** Despite warnings, the city held a Liberty Loan parade (200,000 people). Within 72 hours, 31 hospitals were full. Within a week, 2,600 people were dead.
**W-Curve Mortality:** Usually flu kills U-shape (infants/elderly). This was W-shape (Huge spike in 20-40s).

### Wave 3 (Winter/Spring 1919): The Echo
Less deadly than the second, but still severe. President Woodrow Wilson caught it during the Treaty of Versailles negotiations (some argue his neurological fog affected the harsh terms imposed on Germany).

## The Symptoms

It was horrific.
- Bleeding from eyes, ears, and nose.
- **Heliotrope Cyanosis:** The skin turned blue/purple/black due to lack of oxygen. Patients looked "black" before they died.
- Death often came from secondary bacterial pneumonia.

## Impact

**Demographic:** It killed more people in 24 weeks than AIDS killed in 24 years. It killed more Americans than all the wars of the 20th century combined.
**Forgotten Pandemic:** Unlike WWI, there are few monuments to the Flu. It was "too terrible to remember."
