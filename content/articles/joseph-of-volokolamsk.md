## Summary

Joseph of Volokolamsk was a Russian Orthodox monk and abbot who led the Possessor movement, defending the right of monasteries to own land and property. He argued that wealthy monasteries could better serve the poor, educate clergy, and support the church. His conflict with Nil Sorsky's Non-Possessors shaped Russian church history. He also wrote against the Judaizers heresy and supported the alliance between the Russian Church and the Muscovite state.
