## Summary

Gordon Moore was an American chemist and entrepreneur who co-founded Intel Corporation with Robert Noyce. He is best known for Moore's law, his 1965 observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years. This prediction has guided the semiconductor industry for decades. Moore was also a major philanthropist, donating over $5 billion through the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation.
