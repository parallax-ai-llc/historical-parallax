## Overview

Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, known as "El Padrino" (The Godfather), founded the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1980s and is considered the forefather of the modern Mexican drug trade. Unlike the violent thug archetype, Félix Gallardo was a former police officer and bodyguard who ran his cartel like a disciplined corporation. He united Mexico's fractured "plazas" (territories) into a single confederation and forged the crucial alliance with Colombian cocaine cartels (Escobar) to transport drugs to the US. His downfall came after the brutal torture and murder of DEA agent Kiki Camarena in 1985, which unleashed the full wrath of the US government.

## The Empire

### The Federation

Before him, Mexican traffickers were small-time marijuana/opium farmers.
Félix Gallardo used his police connections to unite leaders:
- **Rafael Caro Quintero** (Marijuana genius)
- **Don Neto** (Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo)
- **El Chapo** (Logistics underling)

He divided territories ("plazas") peacefully.

### The Switch to Cocaine

Realized marijuana was bulky and cheap.
The Caribbean route (Miami) was being squeezed by US task forces.
Félix Gallardo contacted Pablo Escobar. Offered Mexico as the "trampoline" for Colombian cocaine.
Took 50% cut in product (not cash), making Mexican cartels rich.

## The Aftermath

### The Splintering

From prison, Félix Gallardo tried to divide his empire among his lieutenants to prevent war. It failed.
The Federation broke into warring cartels:
- **Tijuana Cartel** (Arellano Félix brothers - his nephews)
- **Sinaloa Cartel** (El Chapo, El Mayo)
- **Juárez Cartel** (Amado Carrillo Fuentes - "Lord of the Skies")

This sparked the bloody Mexican Drug War that continues today.
