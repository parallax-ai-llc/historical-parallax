## Summary

Emperor Gojong (born Yi Myeongbok, September 8, 1852 – January 21, 1919) ruled Korea for 43 years from 1864 to 1907, serving first as the 26th and last king of the Joseon Dynasty, then as the first emperor of the Korean Empire from 1897 until his forced abdication in 1907.[^1][^2] Ascending to the throne at age eleven, he presided over Korea's tumultuous transition from a traditional Confucian kingdom to a modernizing empire amid aggressive Japanese imperialism, ultimately witnessing his nation's loss of sovereignty. His death under suspicious circumstances in 1919 became the catalyst for the March 1st Independence Movement, cementing his legacy as a symbol of Korean resistance against colonial occupation.[^3][^4]

## Early Life and Background

Yi Myeongbok was born on September 8, 1852, at a private residence in Heungseon-gun, Gureumjae-dong, to Yi Ha-eung, known as Grand Internal Prince Heungseon (Heungseon Daewongun), and his mother Lady Min, both from influential aristocratic backgrounds.[^5][^6] His father descended from King Injo (r. 1623–1649) through Prince Sado's line but lacked direct succession claims, living outside the main palace until political circumstances dramatically changed the family's fortunes.[^7] As a child, Gojong was given the name "Gaetdongi" and later "Myeongbok," living what contemporaries described as an unremarkable childhood typical of yangban aristocratic boys of his era.[^8]

His early education followed traditional palace protocols, focusing on Confucian scholarship including the Four Books and Five Classics, historical annals, poetry composition, and moral philosophy, tutored by scholars adhering to Joseon's Neo-Confucian orthodoxy.[^9] This conservative education would later stand in stark contrast to the modernizing reforms he would attempt as emperor. When King Cheoljong died without an heir in 1863, the twelve-year-old Yi Myeongbok was unexpectedly elevated to the throne on December 13, 1863, becoming King Gojong.[^10][^11] His biological father, the Heungseon Daewongun, acted as regent and de facto ruler during Gojong's minority, exercising immense power over state affairs until the young king reached adulthood.[^12]

The circumstances of his ascension placed Gojong at the center of factional court politics from the very beginning of his reign. His father's regency would profoundly shape both his early political development and the conflicts that would later define his rule, particularly the power struggle with his own father over Korea's isolationist versus modernizing policies.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Though Gojong was crowned in 1863, real power remained firmly in the hands of his father, the Heungseon Daewongun, who served as regent until Gojong reached the age of majority.[^14] The Daewongun pursued isolationist policies, resisting Western influence and attempting to strengthen royal authority through administrative reforms that marginalized rival aristocratic factions.[^15] A pivotal turning point came with Gojong's marriage to Lady Min (later Empress Myeongseong) on March 20, 1866, at Changdeok Palace's Injeongjeon Hall.[^16] The Daewongun himself had approved this marriage, reportedly remarking that Min "was a woman of great determination and poise," though he was "slightly disturbed by her," unknowingly creating his greatest political rival.[^17]

Queen Min held fundamentally different views from the Daewongun, believing that "a country cannot survive without contact with foreign nations," advocating for Korea's opening to the world in stark contrast to her father-in-law's closed-door policy.[^18] Tensions escalated when the Daewongun attempted to make Prince Wanhwa crown prince instead of Queen Min's son, deepening the factional divide.[^19] On October 31, 1873, King Gojong, now twenty-one years old, declared his assumption of direct rule, effectively stripping the Daewongun of political authority in what amounted to a palace coup.[^20][^21] This move was orchestrated largely by Queen Min and her clan, who had suffered marginalization under the Daewongun's policies.

Once assuming personal control in 1874, Gojong forced his father into semi-retirement and systematically undid many of his conservative reforms.[^22] This marked the beginning of Gojong's independent reign and Korea's gradual opening to foreign powers. With Queen Min's influence, Gojong adopted an open-door foreign policy, establishing a foreign office in 1882 and welcoming Prussian statesman Paul George Mollendorff as an official advisor to the crown.[^23] That same year, Korea signed a Treaty of Amity and Trade with the United States, with Gojong hoping to gain protection from the imperial designs of neighboring Japan, China, and Russia.[^24] However, these diplomatic overtures would ultimately fail to preserve Korean independence in the face of Japanese aggression.

## Major Achievements

Emperor Gojong's most ambitious achievements centered on the Gwangmu Reform (광무개혁), a comprehensive modernization program that transformed Korea's military, economy, land system, education, and industrial infrastructure between 1897 and 1907.[^25][^26] The Gwangmu land survey, conducted from 1898 to 1904 under the auspices of the Land Surveying Agency, registered ownership for parcels across two-thirds of Korean counties, issuing titles in five of eight provinces and quadrupling national land tax revenue through enhanced collection efficiency and elimination of exemptions.[^27] This represented the most systematic cadastral reform in Korean history and provided the fiscal foundation for other modernization initiatives.

Military modernization significantly expanded the Korean armed forces from approximately 5,000 soldiers in the early 1890s to 28,000 right before the Russo-Japanese War.[^28] Training by Russian officers beginning in 1896 led to the organization of a 1,000-strong royal bodyguard armed with Berdan rifles that served as the core of an improved army, though ultimately this force proved insufficient against Japanese military superiority.[^29] In education, after Gojong proclaimed a new education law, elementary schools were established by the government alongside Western-style schools founded by Western missionaries.[^30] Bosung College was established in 1905 under Yi Yong-ik, while Soongsil Academy, started at Pyongyang in 1897, opened a college in 1905 and received authorization as Soongsil University by the Korean government in 1907.[^31]

Industrial modernization introduced electricity, telegraphy, and trams to Korea's urban centers.[^32] In 1898, the Hanseong Electric Company, an imperial enterprise invested in solely by Gojong, was built, carrying out modern electrical projects including power plants, street lamps, and telephone infrastructure in the capital.[^33] Between 1897 and 1907, Gojong made Deoksugung Palace the center of his reign as emperor, retrofitting the buildings with electricity and telephones—quite rare technologies at the time—and constructing Western-style buildings that symbolized Korea's embrace of modernity.[^34][^35] On October 2, 1896, an intercity telephone call was opened between Deoksugung Palace and Incheon, with Seoul soon operating a 100-line phone system.[^36]

Perhaps Gojong's most symbolically important achievement was the proclamation of the Korean Empire itself on October 13, 1897, at the newly constructed altar Hwangudan.[^37][^38] By declaring himself emperor rather than merely king, Gojong formally severed Korea's historic tributary ties to Qing China and asserted the nation's sovereignty as an independent empire amid encroachment from neighboring imperialist powers.[^39][^40] He named the new empire "Daehan" (Great Han) and changed the regnal year to Gwangmu, with 1897 being the first year of Gwangmu.[^41] On August 17, 1899, Gojong enacted the Constitution of the Korean Empire, which granted him absolute power and established Korea as a constitutional monarchy with the emperor at its apex.[^42] In 1900, Western attire became the official uniform for Korean civil officials, symbolizing the empire's cultural transformation.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Emperor Gojong's reign was marked by devastating failures that ultimately led to Korea's loss of independence, with historians debating whether he was a weak, ineffective leader or simply overwhelmed by impossible geopolitical circumstances.[^44] The most catastrophic event was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 (Eulsa Treaty), which stripped Korea of diplomatic sovereignty and established a Japanese protectorate.[^45][^46] Korean academics argue the treaty was never legally valid as it was independently negotiated under threat of force by Korean ministers without Gojong's approval, the plenipotent head of state.[^47] Conversely, multiple Japanese studies concluded that the treaty was sanctioned with his consent, emphasizing Gojong's active participation throughout the ratification process.[^48] The historical consensus now recognizes that the treaty "forced on the Korean Empire 'at the point of the sword'" represented a fundamental violation of Korean sovereignty.[^49]

Several high-ranking Korean officials protested against the treaty, with Head of the Royal Bodyguard Min Yeong-hwan demanding the treaty be abolished and the five ministers who signed it executed; when his demands were not met, Min committed suicide in protest.[^50] Upon learning of its signing, Emperor Gojong commenced efforts to nullify the treaty, primarily seeking international assistance from countries that had established diplomatic relations with Korea.[^51] He secretly sent Homer Hulbert on a mission to deliver his letter of protest to U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who refused to meet with him, revealing the complete failure of Gojong's strategy to secure Western support.[^52]

The 1907 Hague Secret Emissary Affair represented both Gojong's desperate resistance and his ultimate political downfall.[^53] In June 1906, Nicholas II secretly sent Gojong an invitation to the Hague Convention of 1907, and Gojong dispatched three secret emissaries—Yi Tjoune, Yi Sang-seol, and Yi Wi-jong—to the Second Hague Peace Convention to declare the invalidity of the Eulsa Treaty.[^54][^55] However, the nations at The Hague did not allow the emissaries to participate in the conference, as Korea was no longer viewed as an independent nation since Japan had assumed responsibility for its international representation.[^56] Even Russia, through foreign minister Izvolsky, rejected assistance, conveying that the Russian government had "strict orders not to deal with [the Koreans] at all," demonstrating Russia's reconciliation with Japan at Korea's expense.[^57] Yi Tjoune died in The Hague in mid-July, "a man broken by the obvious collapse of his hopes," while the Japanese forced Gojong to abdicate on July 19-20, 1907, replacing him with his son Sunjong.[^58][^59]

Critics point to Gojong's strategic failures, particularly his over-reliance on foreign powers who ultimately betrayed Korean interests.[^60] His Russian overtures demonstrated the limits of Korean agency in the imperialist era and the dangers of depending on any single power.[^61] In April 1907, the conscripted military units were dissolved and incorporated into the Royal Guards Division, ultimately leading to the failure of Gojong's efforts to secure an independent military base.[^62] Historians note that "Gojong's diplomatic efforts demonstrated the structural weaknesses of the Joseon state, and his inability to consolidate either Russian backing or domestic consensus foreshadowed Korea's 1910 annexation."[^63] The painful reality was that despite his efforts, the emperor was unable to save the Joseon dynasty or prevent Korea's colonization.[^64]

---

## Personal Life

Emperor Gojong married Lady Min (Empress Myeongseong) on March 20, 1866, when he was just fourteen years old and she was fifteen.[^65] The marriage had been arranged by Dowager Queen Sinjeong and the Heungseon Daewongun, who selected her from aristocratic backgrounds.[^66] The young couple faced a difficult start to their marriage; she preferred studying while he enjoyed parties, and she once reportedly said, "He disgusts me."[^67] However, Gojong's love for her was strong and deepened over time, particularly as she became his most important political partner in opposing his father's regency.[^68]

The couple endured heartbreaking difficulties with childbearing. Empress Myeongseong's first four children died shortly after birth.[^69] Their children with Empress Myeongseong included Prince Royal Yi Choi (November 4, 1871 – November 8, 1871), their second son who lived only four days; a second daughter (February 3, 1873 – September 28, 1873); Yi Cheok, who would become Emperor Sunjong (March 25, 1874 – April 24, 1926); Yi Deol (April 5, 1875 – April 18, 1875); and Yi Bu (February 18, 1878 – June 5, 1878).[^70] Only Yi Cheok survived to adulthood. Gojong also fathered children with other consorts, including Yi Un, Crown Prince Uimin (October 20, 1897 – May 1, 1970) with Imperial Noble Consort Sunheon, and Princess Deokhye (May 25, 1912 – April 21, 1989) with Imperial Consort Gwi-in.[^71]

The assassination of Empress Myeongseong on October 8, 1895, devastated Gojong and fundamentally altered his reign.[^72] Japanese minister to Korea Miura Gorō orchestrated the plot against her, and a group of Japanese agents entered Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, which was under guard by Korean troops sympathetic to the Japanese, and murdered the queen.[^73] After her death, Gojong locked himself in his chambers for weeks, refusing to perform his duties, demonstrating the depth of his grief and emotional dependence on her.[^74] This trauma led directly to his flight to the Russian legation on February 11, 1896, where he and the crown prince took refuge until February 20, 1897, fearing for their lives from Japanese agents.[^75]

Gojong survived multiple assassination attempts throughout his reign. On September 12, 1898, Kim Hong-nuik orchestrated a plot to poison Gojong by instilling opium into his coffee on his 47th birthday.[^76] Gojong, a coffee lover, noticed the taste was different and spit it out after only two or three sips, experiencing only slight nausea.[^77] However, Crown Prince Sunjong, unfamiliar with coffee's taste, consumed a substantial amount and suffered devastating injuries including repeated vomiting, fainting, spitting blood in his stool, and losing all his teeth, requiring dentures for the rest of his life; historians believe he was rendered impotent.[^78][^79] The three conspirators were hastily tried on October 10, found guilty, strangled, and their bodies cast into the street where they were horribly mutilated by an angry mob.[^80] In July 1898, Minister of Military Ahn Gyeong-su attempted to force Gojong's abdication and was executed for conspiracy on May 28, 1900.[^81]

## Legacy

Emperor Gojong's death on January 21, 1919, at Deoksugung Palace at age 66 became one of the most consequential events in modern Korean history.[^82] The official cause was listed as cerebral hemorrhage, but persistent rumors that he had been poisoned by Japanese agents spread throughout Korea and remain widely believed to this day.[^83][^84] His death directly catalyzed the March 1st Independence Movement, with organizers strategically scheduling their protest for March 1, the day of Gojong's public funeral, to capitalize on the significant number of people congregating in Seoul.[^85][^86] By early 1919, Korean activists had become angered by the rebuffing of Korean representatives to the Paris Peace Conference, by the brutality of Japanese rule, and by widespread belief that Gojong had been murdered.[^87]

The 1919 March First Movement protests are widely seen as a significant catalyst for the international independence movement, though domestically the protests were violently suppressed.[^88] Following the violent repression, numerous Koreans fled to Shanghai, where in April 1919 they founded the Korean Provisional Government, establishing an organized independence movement that would continue throughout the colonial period.[^89] Gojong's funeral thus transformed his death into a powerful symbol of Korean resistance, with his legacy as "a fearless advocate for Korea's independence" inspiring generations of independence activists.[^90]

The Korean Empire period left a complex legacy that continues to influence modern Korea, fostering the development of modern Korean national identity and patriotism and inspiring resistance movements against Japanese colonialism and occupation.[^91] Although the modernization effort was ultimately overwhelmed by Japan, who forcibly annexed Korea in 1910, "it planted in the minds of Koreans the courage and pride to maintain their culture throughout the brutal occupation period."[^92] The Gwangmu Reform later staged the fundamental background for future Korean development in infrastructure, reforming the economy and creating the nucleus of the modern bureaucracy and military.[^93]

Modern historians have emphasized that Emperor Gojong accelerated national efforts to modernize commerce, politics, diplomacy, society and culture, with new systems and technologies introduced from Japan, the United States and Europe and openly accepted by Korean society through government encouragement.[^94] In 1897, King Gojong formally renamed the Joseon Dynasty to the Korean Empire and declared himself Emperor "in order to assert the nation's sovereignty amid encroachment from neighboring imperialist powers," a symbolic act that resonated powerfully with Korean nationalist sentiment.[^95] His reign marked the end of over 500 years of the Joseon Dynasty and Korea's tragic transition into colonial subjugation, making him a poignant figure representing both Korea's modernization aspirations and its loss of independence.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars have increasingly reassessed Emperor Gojong as a more complex and active figure than earlier portrayals suggested. Contemporary historical analysis reveals "Gojong not as a passive figure, but as a ruler attempting—however imperfectly—to navigate an impossible geopolitical landscape."[^96] His domestic and foreign policies proved successful initially, as he skillfully played rival Russian, Japanese and Chinese sides off each other to prevent any single power from totally controlling Korea, while his domestic policy of industrializing Korea met with considerable success.[^97][^98]

Supporters emphasize that Gojong faced unprecedented challenges during the age of imperialism when even larger Asian powers like China were being carved into spheres of influence by Western powers and Japan. His proclamation of the Korean Empire in 1897 represented a bold assertion of Korean sovereignty at a time when most Asian nations were losing independence.[^99] The Gwangmu Reforms demonstrated genuine commitment to modernization, with the land survey, educational initiatives, industrial development, and military expansion representing substantial achievements given Korea's limited resources and time constraints.[^100]

Gojong's resistance efforts, including his refuge at the Russian legation, his secret communications with foreign powers, and the Hague Secret Emissary mission, demonstrate that he actively resisted Japanese encroachment rather than passively accepting Korea's fate.[^101] His death sparked the March 1st Movement, suggesting that Koreans viewed him as a symbol of resistance and legitimate Korean sovereignty against illegitimate Japanese occupation.[^102] Defenders argue that blaming Gojong for Korea's annexation ignores the overwhelming military and diplomatic superiority Japan had achieved by the early 20th century, having defeated both China (1895) and Russia (1905) in wars fought partly over control of Korea.

### Negative Views

Critics contend that Emperor Gojong's leadership failures directly contributed to Korea's loss of independence and that a more capable ruler might have preserved Korean sovereignty or at least negotiated better terms. Historians point to fundamental strategic errors, particularly his over-reliance on foreign powers who consistently betrayed Korean interests.[^103] His Russian overtures demonstrated "the limits of Korean agency in the imperialist era and the dangers of over-reliance on any single power," with Russia ultimately abandoning Korea in favor of reconciliation with Japan.[^104]

Skeptics argue that Gojong failed to build domestic consensus or consolidate power effectively, as evidenced by his inability to prevent Korean ministers from signing the 1905 treaty and his failure to maintain loyal military forces.[^105] By April 1907, the conscripted units were dissolved and incorporated into the Royal Guards Division, "ultimately leading to the failure of Gojong's efforts to secure an independent military base."[^106] Critics note that "Gojong's diplomatic efforts demonstrated the structural weaknesses of the Joseon state, and his inability to consolidate either Russian backing or domestic consensus foreshadowed Korea's 1910 annexation."[^107]

Some historians question the sincerity of his modernization efforts, noting that reforms were implemented inconsistently and often served to strengthen imperial power rather than build national strength. The fact that he enacted a constitution in 1899 granting himself absolute power suggests priorities of personal authority over institutional development.[^108] Furthermore, critics point out that the Veritable Records (Annals) of the last two Joseon rulers, including Gojong, "are controversial and considered by modern South Korean historians to lack the impartiality of the other sources because Japanese officials interfered in their creation and curation," making objective historical assessment challenging.[^109] Ultimately, critics argue, despite his efforts and the impossible circumstances he faced, "the king was unable to save the Joseon dynasty," and Korea fell under colonial rule for 35 years.[^110]
