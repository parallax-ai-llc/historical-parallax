## Summary

Paisius Velichkovsky was a Ukrainian Orthodox monk who revived the Hesychast tradition of contemplative prayer in Eastern Europe. He translated the Philokalia from Greek into Slavonic, making it accessible to Slavic monks and laypeople. His translation inspired the famous Russian spiritual classic The Way of a Pilgrim. He gathered a large monastic community at the Neamț Monastery in Moldova, which became a center of spiritual renewal.
