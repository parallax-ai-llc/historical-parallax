## Summary

Venus Ebony Starr Williams, born June 17, 1980, is an American professional tennis player and one of the most influential athletes of her generation. A seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and 14-time Grand Slam doubles champion (all with sister Serena), Venus revolutionized women's tennis with her powerful serve-and-volley game and became the first African American woman to reach World No. 1 in the Open Era.[^1][^2] Beyond her athletic achievements, she is renowned for her successful advocacy for equal prize money at Wimbledon and the French Open, her entrepreneurial ventures including an interior design firm and fashion line, and her resilience in continuing to compete at age 45 despite battling Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease.[^3][^4][^5]

## Early Life and Background

Venus Ebony Starr Williams was born on June 17, 1980, in Lynwood, California, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price.[^6] She is the fourth of Oracene's five daughters, with three older half-sisters—Yetunde, Lyndrea, and Isha—from her mother's previous marriage to Yusef Rasheed, and one younger sister, Serena, born in 1981.[^7] The family's story began when Oracene married Richard in 1980, shortly before Venus's birth, setting the stage for one of sport's most remarkable family sagas.[^8]

Shortly after Venus was born, the Williams family moved to Oracene's hometown of Saginaw, Michigan, where Serena was born. They returned to California a few years later, settling in Compton, a working-class neighborhood plagued by drugs and gang violence throughout the 1980s.[^9] The Williams sisters learned tennis on nearby Compton municipal courts, frequently having to take cover to avoid being hit by stray gunfire from the violence that gripped the city.[^10] This environment, far removed from the traditional country club settings where most tennis champions emerged, would become central to the Williams sisters' narrative and their father's unconventional training methods.

Venus got her first real tennis lessons when she was just four years old under the guidance of her father Richard, who had taught himself the sport by watching instructional videos.[^11] Serena, only two years younger, tagged along and soon begged to play too. The young sisters rarely left the courts, grinding through practice sessions that started as early as 6 a.m. and stretched into the dark of night after school.[^12] Their father's rigorous training regimen was matched by their mother Oracene's coaching expertise, as both parents played crucial roles in developing their daughters' skills.[^13]

By the time she was ten, Venus had compiled a remarkable 63–0 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1 among under-12 players in Southern California.[^14] Recognizing their daughters' exceptional potential, the Williams family made a pivotal decision to move from Compton, California, to West Palm Beach, Florida, when Venus was eleven, so that she and Serena could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci.[^15] Macci, who had taken notice of the sisters' extraordinary talent, would provide additional professional coaching to complement their parents' instruction. This move marked a significant transition in Venus's development from a local prodigy to a future professional champion, though Richard Williams would famously pull his daughters from the junior circuit to protect them from burnout and racism, a controversial decision that nonetheless proved prescient.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Already well-known in tennis circles, Venus Williams turned professional on October 31, 1994, at just 14 years old, immediately generating buzz in the tennis world.[^17] Her decision to turn professional at such a young age was both bold and strategic, as her father Richard Williams carefully managed her early career to avoid the pitfalls that had derailed other young phenoms. Unlike most junior players who gradually worked their way up through smaller tournaments, Venus's entry into professional tennis was marked by her father's unconventional approach of limiting her tournament schedule to prevent burnout.[^18]

The tennis world got its first real glimpse of Venus's championship potential at the 1997 US Open when, as a 17-year-old unseeded player, she reached her first major final.[^19] Her run to the final was remarkable not only for her age but for the powerful, aggressive style of play she displayed, featuring a serve that regularly exceeded 120 mph—speeds that were revolutionary for women's tennis at the time. Although she lost that final to Martina Hingis, Venus's performance announced her arrival as a future champion and transformed expectations for women's tennis.[^20]

On March 30, 1998, Venus's ranking broke into the top 10 for the first time, reaching world No. 10.[^21] That same year, she demonstrated her versatility by teaming with Justin Gimelstob to win the mixed doubles titles at both the Australian Open and the French Open, proving she could excel in multiple forms of the game.[^22] These victories showcased not just her powerful groundstrokes but also her excellent net play and tactical intelligence, skills that would serve her well throughout her career.

The breakthrough moment in Venus's singles career came on July 8, 2000, when she won her first Wimbledon title by defeating Lindsay Davenport in the final.[^23] In what would become a signature achievement, Venus defeated the defending champion and three future Hall of Famers on her way to claiming the title at the All England Club, establishing Wimbledon as her most successful Grand Slam venue.[^24] The victory was particularly sweet as it came against Davenport, one of the game's biggest servers, in a match that showcased Venus's ability to compete at the highest level on grass courts.

Months later, Venus captured the US Open title, becoming only the second African American woman after Althea Gibson to win both Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year.[^25] But 2000 held even more glory: at the Sydney Olympics, Venus captured the gold medal in the singles competition and, partnering with Serena, won the doubles event as well.[^26] This remarkable treble—Wimbledon, US Open, and Olympic gold—established Venus as the dominant force in women's tennis entering the new millennium.

Venus successfully defended both her Wimbledon and US Open titles in 2001, cementing her status as the world's premier player.[^27] At the 2001 US Open, she defeated Serena in the final in what was the first prime time broadcast of a women's singles final, a historic moment that demonstrated the Williams sisters' drawing power and cultural impact.[^28] On February 25, 2002, Venus Williams became the first African American woman to be ranked World No. 1 in the Open Era, reaching the pinnacle of her sport just seven years after turning professional.[^29] She would hold the number one ranking for a total of 11 weeks during her career, though her influence on the game far exceeded what that statistic might suggest.[^30]

## Major Achievements

Venus Williams's trophy cabinet reflects a career of sustained excellence across multiple decades and formats of tennis. Her 49 WTA Tour-level singles titles include seven Grand Slam championships—five at Wimbledon (2000, 2001, 2005, 2007, 2008) and two at the US Open (2000, 2001)—establishing her as one of the most successful players of her generation.[^31][^32] Wimbledon, where she accumulated 90 career wins (more than at any other tournament), became synonymous with Venus's game, her powerful serve perfectly suited to the grass courts of the All England Club.[^33]

In Grand Slam finals, Venus compiled a 7-9 record from 16 total finals appearances, winning 43.8% of her championship matches.[^34] While this winning percentage is lower than some all-time greats, it reflects the consistently high level at which she competed, repeatedly reaching the sport's biggest stages. Remarkably, her Grand Slam win percentage of 76% exceeds her overall career win rate of 74%, demonstrating her exceptional ability to elevate her performance at majors.[^35]

Venus's doubles career equals or perhaps surpasses her singles achievements. Partnering with Serena, she won 14 women's doubles Grand Slam titles, and the pair remained unbeaten in major doubles finals throughout their career.[^36] This perfect record in the biggest doubles matches is one of the most remarkable statistics in tennis history. Venus also won two mixed doubles major titles, bringing her combined total to 23 Grand Slam titles across all disciplines.[^37] The sisters' doubles partnership revolutionized women's doubles, bringing power and athleticism to a format that had often been overshadowed by singles competition.

The Olympic Games provided another stage for Venus's excellence. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, she won gold medals in both singles and doubles (with Serena), becoming one of the few players to achieve the Olympic double.[^38] She added two more Olympic gold medals in women's doubles at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2012 London Olympics, again partnering with Serena.[^39] At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Venus won a silver medal in mixed doubles, making her one of only two female players (alongside Kathleen McKane Godfree) to win medals in all three Olympic tennis events.[^40] Her five Olympic medals tie her with Godfree for the most Olympic medals won in tennis history, a record that demonstrates her versatility and longevity.[^41]

Beyond her playing achievements, Venus's advocacy for equal prize money stands as one of her most important contributions to sport. Beginning with a speech to the Grand Slam Committee on the eve of winning the 2005 Wimbledon final, Venus launched a two-year campaign for equal pay at Wimbledon.[^42] In her testimony, she asked committee members to close their eyes and try to feel the person next to them, asking "Can you tell if that person is a man or a woman?" to illustrate that all hearts beat the same rhythm, regardless of gender.[^43] When nothing changed in 2006, she published a powerful column in The Times of London, writing: "The message I like to convey to women and girls across the globe is that there is no glass ceiling," expressing her fear that "Wimbledon is loudly and clearly sending the opposite message."[^44]

In February 2007, after seven years of persistent advocacy, All England Club Chairman Tony Phillips announced that Wimbledon would offer equal prize money to men and women.[^45] One month later, citing Williams's involvement as the tipping point, the French Open followed suit.[^46] Appropriately, Venus became the first women's champion to receive equal prize money when she won Wimbledon in 2007, taking home £700,000—the same amount Roger Federer earned for his victory the following day.[^47] This achievement arguably transcends all her on-court accomplishments, fundamentally changing the economics of professional tennis for all women who followed.

Venus's longevity achievements are equally impressive. At 33 years and 8 months, she became the seventh-oldest woman to win a WTA singles title when she captured the 2014 Dubai Tennis Championships.[^48] Shortly after her 37th birthday, she returned to the Top 10 by reaching the 2017 Wimbledon final, becoming (at that time) the third-oldest player to rank in the Top 10 in WTA history behind Billie Jean King and Martina Navratilova.[^49] At the 2016 US Open, she broke Amy Frazier's record for most Grand Slam appearances, surpassing 71 major tournaments.[^50] In 2021, she set a new record as the all-time leader in Grand Slam tournaments played, reaching 90 total appearances.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Venus Williams has maintained a remarkably clean reputation throughout her career—with fellow player Andy Roddick noting "I don't think she's ever even had a sniff of controversy around her" and praising her for "conducting herself properly"—she has faced criticism and challenges, particularly in the latter stages of her career.[^52]

The most significant criticism in recent years has focused on her continued participation in professional tennis despite declining results. Critics have taken issue with Venus requesting wildcards to tournaments, arguing that she is no longer competitive and that these spots would be better allocated to younger players developing their careers.[^53] Heading into the 2025 Washington tournament, Williams had lost her last four matches, fueling arguments that she was taking opportunities from more deserving players.[^54] At age 43 in 2023, she suffered her most lopsided US Open defeat when she was eliminated 6-1, 6-1 by Belgian qualifier Greet Minnen, marking her third consecutive opening-round loss at the tournament.[^55]

The 2023 season proved particularly frustrating, as Venus pulled a hamstring before the Australian Open, fell and tweaked her knee during a first-round loss at Wimbledon, and suffered another first-round loss at the US Open.[^56] These physical setbacks and poor results led some commentators to suggest that Venus was tarnishing her legacy by continuing to play rather than retiring gracefully. Her serve, once one of the most feared weapons in women's tennis, has lost some of its velocity, and her movement on court is no longer as crisp as it was in her prime years.[^57]

Throughout their careers, Venus and Serena endured racist and sexist attacks that went largely unacknowledged by mainstream tennis media and organizations.[^58] Despite their incredible success and transformative impact on the sport, they faced constant criticism that many observers attributed to a mixture of racism, sexism, and jealousy.[^59] Venus experienced gender-based wage inequity firsthand at the young age of 16 when she received less prize money than a male player who lost in the same round of a tournament, an experience that would fuel her later advocacy work.[^60]

Some criticism emerged regarding the Williams sisters' early withdrawal from junior tennis circuits. Richard Williams's decision to pull his daughters from junior competition to protect them from racism and burnout was controversial at the time, with tennis establishment figures arguing that the girls needed to "pay their dues" through traditional development pathways.[^61] However, this criticism proved misguided as both sisters went on to dominate professional tennis, vindicating their father's unconventional approach.

Venus has also faced occasional criticism for her business ventures and outside interests, with some suggesting that her fashion line, interior design company, and other entrepreneurial activities have distracted from her tennis.[^62] During certain periods of her career when her results dipped, commentators questioned whether she was sufficiently focused on tennis or spreading herself too thin across multiple endeavors. However, Venus has consistently defended her right to pursue interests beyond tennis, arguing that a well-rounded life has actually enhanced rather than detracted from her athletic performance and longevity.

The diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome in 2011 brought another form of challenge, as some observers questioned whether her continued participation was advisable given the serious nature of her autoimmune condition.[^63] Early in her diagnosis, when she withdrew from the 2011 US Open due to debilitating symptoms, there was speculation about whether her career was effectively over.[^64] Venus proved the doubters wrong by managing her condition through lifestyle changes, including adopting a vegan diet, and returning to win additional titles and reach Grand Slam finals even after her diagnosis.[^65]

## Personal Life

Venus Williams has never been married and has maintained a notably private personal life despite her decades in the public eye.[^66] She previously dated golfer Hank Kuehne and Cuban model Elio Pis, with her most recent known relationship being with financier Nicholas Hammond, whom she began dating in 2017.[^67][^68] Sources suggest that relationship may have ended, though Venus's preference for privacy means few details have been confirmed publicly. She has stated that she is content with her life and does not feel pressured to marry or conform to societal expectations, reflecting her independent spirit and commitment to self-discovery.[^69]

Venus values her privacy intensely and has successfully maintained control over her personal narrative in an era of pervasive social media and tabloid culture.[^70] Her approach to relationships reflects the same fierce independence she has demonstrated throughout her athletic career. When asked about marriage and family, Venus has emphasized that she defines success and fulfillment on her own terms, not according to conventional social timelines or expectations.

Beyond tennis, Venus has cultivated diverse interests in the arts, business, and design. She has said, "I have always loved the arts. It's my place outside of the court," noting that the arts are something she chose for herself, distinct from tennis, which her parents introduced to her at age four.[^71] This distinction is important to Venus, who has worked to establish an identity beyond her athletic achievements.

Venus earned an associate degree in fashion design from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale in 2007, having attended the college since fall 1999 while balancing her studies with her professional tennis career.[^72] Not content with one degree, she later earned a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from Indiana University, enrolling in the university's online degree completion program in 2011 and receiving her diploma in August 2015.[^73] She was the first professional athlete to graduate from this program, which was tailored for WTA players through a partnership between the WTA, the Women's Tennis Benefits Association, and Indiana University East.[^74] Venus explained that while she valued her art school education, it was always her dream to have a business degree, as she needed those tools to be a better leader and planner for her various business ventures.[^75]

In 2002, Venus founded V Starr Interiors, a South Florida-based full-service interior design firm that has completed projects ranging from residential homes to commercial spaces.[^76] Her personal design aesthetic trends toward mid-century modern mixed with Island British colonial, reflecting the tropical locations where she has lived.[^77] She describes her style as "very eclectic" and enjoys mixing different design influences.[^78] Her passion for interior design led to her most recent venture: co-founding Palazzo.ai, a company that uses artificial intelligence to help people design their spaces, demonstrating her interest in how technology can democratize design.[^79]

Venus launched her fashion line, EleVen, in 2007, creating a brand that emphasizes health, lifestyle, and athletic wear.[^80] The company has garnered attention and collaborated with professional athletes from various sports including basketball, soccer, and tennis.[^81] Venus has showcased EleVen's stylish and unique designs during her Wimbledon appearances, firmly establishing her place within the sports fashion industry.[^82] She later co-founded Happy Viking, a direct-to-consumer company that produces complete plant-based nutritional drinks.[^83]

Venus's business portfolio extends to ownership stakes in major sports franchises. She has invested in several companies, including the UFC, and has acquired ownership stakes in the Miami Dolphins (NFL) and the Philadelphia 76ers (NBA).[^84] These investments demonstrate her business acumen and her commitment to building wealth and influence beyond her playing career. As CEO of V Starr Interiors, Brand Founder of EleVen by Venus Williams, and Founder of Happy Viking, Venus has built a multifaceted business empire that reflects her diverse interests and entrepreneurial drive.[^85]

Following her Sjögren's syndrome diagnosis in 2011, Venus adopted a vegan diet and made significant lifestyle changes to manage her autoimmune condition.[^86] She has spoken openly about learning to prioritize rest and stress reduction, acknowledging that she had to fundamentally change her approach to recovery and self-care.[^87] This openness about her health challenges has made her an advocate for autoimmune disease awareness, with her continued athletic success inspiring others facing similar diagnoses.

## Legacy

Venus Williams's legacy extends far beyond the 49 singles titles and 23 Grand Slam championships (across singles, doubles, and mixed doubles) that define her statistical achievements.[^88] She stands as a transformative figure who fundamentally altered women's tennis, broke down racial barriers, and opened doors for generations of diverse athletes who followed in her footsteps.

Most significantly, Venus became the first Black woman since Althea Gibson to claim the Wimbledon championship in 2000, a 42-year gap that underscored the sport's lack of diversity and the magnitude of her breakthrough.[^89] Together with Serena, Venus redefined women's tennis not only through athletic ability but through contemporary style, cultural exposure, and the infusion of African American culture into a sport traditionally associated with white, upper-class country clubs.[^90] A consciousness of race and culture was infused into tennis in a scope unprecedented in the game's history, fundamentally changing who could see themselves as potential tennis champions.[^91]

Venus noted with pride the increasing representation of Black women in tennis in recent years, crediting this progress to the pathways she and Serena helped create.[^92] The visibility of their success demonstrated to young African American girls that tennis could be a viable career option, not just an activity for the privileged few. The impact of the Williams sisters on tennis culture and society remains immeasurable, inspiring a generation of players—including Coco Gauff, Sloane Stephens, and Madison Keys—who now see professional tennis as an attainable dream.[^93]

The Williams sisters' journey from the gang-ridden public courts of Compton to the manicured lawns of Wimbledon became one of sport's most compelling narratives, challenging assumptions about where champions come from and what they should look like.[^94] Their success validated their father Richard Williams's unconventional training methods and his decision to pull them from junior tennis, proving that there were alternative pathways to excellence beyond the traditional country club development system.

Venus's advocacy for equal prize money represents perhaps her most enduring contribution beyond her playing achievements. Her seven-year fight culminated in Wimbledon and the French Open awarding equal prize money to women in 2007, fundamentally changing the economics of professional tennis.[^95] In 2007, Williams became the first woman to collect an equal-sized paycheck as her male counterpart at Wimbledon, a watershed moment that she helped create through persistent advocacy.[^96] This activism has become a defining aspect of her legacy, demonstrating that athletes can use their platform to create systemic change.

Venus has continued her advocacy beyond tennis, recently launching the #PrivilegeTax campaign to bring awareness to wage inequality across all industries.[^97] She has stated that she is "setting her sights on putting an end to wage inequality across all industries," using her voice and influence to address gender pay gaps in corporate America and beyond.[^98] This work ensures that her impact will be felt long after her playing career ends, as she works to create equity in workplaces far removed from tennis courts.

Venus touched on two defining aspects of her career in a recent interview: her fight for equal prize money for female tennis players and the portfolio of off-court interests that her sporting talents afforded her.[^99] Notably, she said she takes even greater pride in what she has accomplished beyond the court, recognizing that she utilized her platform early to make a positive impact through tennis, her design firm V Starr, and her various business ventures.[^100]

Her longevity and resilience have become central to her legacy. Continuing to compete at age 45 despite battling Sjögren's syndrome, Venus made a historic return to the US Open in 2025, becoming the oldest player to compete in the tournament in decades.[^101] While her recent results have been disappointing, her persistence has inspired admiration for her unwillingness to be defined by her illness or age. She has demonstrated that athletes can compete on their own terms, for as long as they choose, regardless of external expectations about when they should retire.

Venus's influence on the power game in women's tennis cannot be overstated. Her powerful serve, aggressive baseline play, and athletic approach to the game raised the standard for what was physically possible in women's tennis, forcing other players to elevate their strength and conditioning to compete.[^102] The modern women's game, characterized by powerful serving and aggressive baseline play, owes much to the template Venus established in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

An exhibit at the National Museum of African American History and Culture celebrates Venus and Serena Williams within the Sports: Leveling the Playing Field gallery, documenting their impact on professional tennis and their influence as African American athletes.[^103] This permanent installation ensures that their contributions to American culture and sports history will be remembered and studied by future generations. Cultured magazine honored Venus for her on- and off-court cultural impact, recognizing that her influence extends well beyond sports into fashion, business, and social advocacy.[^104]

Venus Williams's legacy is that of a pioneer, champion, activist, and entrepreneur who refused to be confined to a single identity or role. She demonstrated that athletes could be multidimensional, pursuing excellence in sports while simultaneously building businesses, advocating for social change, and cultivating interests in design and the arts. For young women, particularly women of color, Venus proved that success could be defined on one's own terms, that barriers could be broken, and that a platform earned through athletic excellence could be leveraged to create lasting change far beyond the field of play.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Tennis historians and scholars widely regard Venus Williams as one of the most important figures in the sport's history, with her significance extending well beyond her impressive trophy collection. John McEnroe, a tennis legend and commentator, has praised Venus for her mental toughness and ability to perform in crucial moments, particularly noting her dominance at Wimbledon across multiple eras of competition.[^105]

Billie Jean King, herself a pioneer for equality in tennis, has lauded Venus's advocacy for equal prize money, stating that Venus "finished what I started" and crediting her with making the final push that secured equal pay at Wimbledon and the French Open.[^106] King has noted that Venus's willingness to speak publicly about inequality, even while competing at the highest level, required tremendous courage and risked backlash from tournament organizers.[^107]

Sports sociologists and cultural critics have highlighted the Williams sisters' transformational impact on tennis's demographics and cultural perception. Dr. Douglas Hartmann, a sociologist who studies race and sports, has written about how Venus and Serena "literally changed the face of tennis," making the sport more accessible and relevant to communities that had previously seen tennis as exclusionary and elitist.[^108] Their success inspired a generation of diverse players and expanded tennis's fan base significantly, particularly among African American and multicultural audiences.

Tennis coach and commentator Patrick McEnroe has praised Venus's technical innovations, particularly her combination of power and finesse that was revolutionary for women's tennis in the late 1990s.[^109] He notes that Venus, more than any single player, ushered in the modern era of powerful, athletic women's tennis that now dominates the sport. Her serve-and-volley game, aggressive baseline play, and exceptional movement set new standards that other players had to meet to remain competitive.

Martina Navratilova, an 18-time Grand Slam singles champion, has spoken admiringly of Venus's longevity and ability to compete at the highest levels across multiple decades despite her health challenges.[^110] Navratilova, who herself competed successfully into her forties, has noted that Venus's management of Sjögren's syndrome while continuing to compete professionally demonstrates remarkable dedication and serves as an inspiration to athletes facing chronic health conditions.

Business publications have praised Venus's entrepreneurial success, with Forbes featuring her as an example of athlete-entrepreneurs who have successfully built business empires beyond their playing careers.[^111] Her interior design firm V Starr Interiors has been recognized for completing high-profile projects, and her fashion line EleVen has been praised for combining performance functionality with style.[^112]

### Negative Views

Some tennis purists and analysts have criticized what they perceive as Venus's inconsistency compared to other all-time greats. While she won seven Grand Slam singles titles, critics note that this total falls well short of her sister Serena's 23 titles and the totals compiled by Margaret Court (24), Steffi Graf (22), and other legends.[^113] These critics argue that Venus, despite her obvious talent and physical advantages, never fully maximized her potential and should have won more majors given her abilities.

Tennis analyst Mary Carillo has suggested that Venus's outside business interests occasionally diverted focus from tennis, potentially costing her additional titles during peak years of her career.[^114] Carillo and others have pointed to periods where Venus's tournament schedule was lighter than peers, suggesting that her commitment to tennis sometimes wavered compared to single-minded champions like Graf or Monica Seles.

In recent years, some commentators and younger players have expressed frustration with Venus's continued participation despite declining results and repeated first-round losses. Critics argue that by accepting wildcards to major tournaments when her ranking no longer warrants direct entry, Venus is taking opportunities away from younger players who might benefit more from the experience and exposure.[^115] These critics suggest that Venus should retire gracefully rather than tarnish her legacy with disappointing performances.

Some analysts have noted Venus's relatively poor record in Grand Slam finals compared to other champions, winning only 7 of her 16 final appearances (43.8%).[^116] Critics point out that true champions elevate their performance in finals, whereas Venus sometimes struggled on the biggest stages, particularly in finals against her sister Serena (where she won only 2 of 9 encounters) and against players she had beaten in earlier rounds.

Certain tennis traditionalists initially resisted the Williams sisters' impact on the sport, with some critics uncomfortable with their confident demeanor, fashion choices, and celebration styles that challenged tennis's traditionally reserved culture.[^117] While overt criticism has diminished over time, early in their careers Venus and Serena faced coded language and commentary that many observers interpreted as racially and culturally motivated. Some European tennis officials and commentators made remarks about their playing style and presence that reflected discomfort with how they were changing the sport's culture and demographics.

A few sports physicians and medical experts have questioned whether Venus's continued participation despite Sjögren's syndrome is medically advisable, expressing concern about the long-term impacts of intense physical activity on someone with her autoimmune condition.[^118] While Venus has managed her condition successfully, some medical professionals have suggested that the physical stress of professional tennis could potentially worsen her symptoms or lead to additional health complications.

Some business analysts have noted that despite her entrepreneurial ventures, Venus has not achieved the same level of commercial success off the court as some other athlete-entrepreneurs, with her various businesses remaining relatively modest in scale compared to her sister's ventures or those of athletes like LeBron James or Roger Federer.[^119] Critics suggest that her business interests, while diverse, have not reached their full commercial potential, possibly due to spreading her focus across too many different ventures rather than concentrating on building one major enterprise.
