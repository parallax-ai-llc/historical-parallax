## Summary

Choi Kyu-hah (born July 16, 1919; died October 22, 2006) served as the 4th President of South Korea from 1979 to 1980.[^1] A career diplomat known for his mild manner and administrative competence, Choi was thrust into the presidency following the assassination of Park Chung-hee. His brief, tragic term is defined by his powerlessness in the face of the rising military junta led by **Chun Doo-hwan**. Despite his stated desire to oversee a peaceful transition to democracy (the "Seoul Spring"), he was effectively a figurehead who was forced to legitimize the **12.12 Coup**, the extension of martial law, and the suppression of the **Gwangju Uprising**, before being pressured to resign.[^2]

## Early Life and Diplomatic Career

Choi Kyu-hah was born in 1919 in Wonju, Gangwon Province, into a family of Confucian scholars. He studied English literature and political science in Japan and Manchuria.[^3]

After the founding of the Republic of Korea, Choi joined the foreign ministry, where his fluency in English and calm demeanor served him well. He rose steadily through the diplomatic ranks:

- **Ambassador to Malaysia (1964–1967)**
- **Minister of Foreign Affairs (1967–1971):** He skilfully managed ROK-US relations during the Vietnam War era.
- **Prime Minister (1975–1979):** He served as a loyal, technocratic Prime Minister under Park Chung-hee, focusing on administration while avoiding political controversies.[^4]

## Presidency: The "Crisis Manager"

### The Assassination and Acting President

On October 26, 1979, President Park Chung-hee was assassinated by his intelligence chief. As Prime Minister, Choi Kyu-hah automatically became Acting President. In December 1979, he was officially elected as the 4th President by the National Conference for Unification.[^5]

Choi promised a "gradual" transition to democracy, proposing to amend the authoritarian Yushin Constitution and hold free elections. This period of hope was known as the **"Seoul Spring,"** as political bans were lifted and opposition leaders like Kim Dae-jung resumed activity.[^6]

### The 12.12 Military Coup

However, Choi's authority was immediately undermined. On the night of **December 12, 1979**, Major General **Chun Doo-hwan** (head of the Defense Security Command) launched a military coup to arrest the Army Chief of Staff.

- **The Confrontation:** Chun's forces stormed the official residence to demand Choi's signature on the arrest warrant. Choi refused to sign without the Defense Minister's presence, stalling for hours, but lacking any military control, he eventually capitulated.[^7]
- **The Figurehead:** From that night on, while Choi remained the nominal head of state, real power had shifted to Chun and his "New Military" faction (Hanahoe).[^8]

### Gwangju Uprising and Resignation

By May 1980, student protests demanding democratization intensified. On May 17, under pressure from Chun, Choi's cabinet extended martial law to the entire nation, dissolving the National Assembly and arresting opposition leaders. This triggered the **Gwangju Uprising**.[^9]

- **Silence:** Throughout the brutal massacre in Gwangju, President Choi remained largely silent and invisible, unable to restrain the military's actions.[^10]
- **Resignation:** On August 16, 1980, having served only eight months, Choi announced his resignation to "pave the way for a new era," officially handing power to Chun Doo-hwan.[^11]

## Later Life and Silence

After resigning, Choi lived deeply private life in his home in Seogyo-dong, Seoul. He famously refused to testify about the events of 1979 and 1980 for the rest of his life, even when summoned by the National Assembly and courts during the 1995 trials of Chun Doo-hwan.[^12] He maintained that "presidential governing acts should not be subject to judicial judgment," taking the secrets of the coup to his grave.

He died on October 22, 2006, at the age of 87.[^13]

## Legacy

Choi Kyu-hah is often viewed with a mixture of sympathy and criticism.

**Historical Assessment:**

- **The Helpless President:** He is widely seen as a tragic figure—a gentleman bureaucrat ill-suited for a ruthless power struggle. He attempted to maintain constitutional order but was overwhelmed by the military's gunpoint diplomacy.[^14]
- **Criticism of Silence:** Critics argue that his refusal to resist the coup or speak out against the Gwangju massacre constitutes a dereliction of duty. His silence protected the coup leaders and denied historical truth to the victims.[^15]
- **Integrity:** On a personal level, he was known for his frugality and integrity. After his death, it was revealed that he still used the same briquette boiler and electric fan from the 1970s, earning him posthumous respect for his clean lifestyle.[^16]
