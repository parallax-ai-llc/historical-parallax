## Summary

Zheng Jing (1642-1681) was the son of the legendary Ming loyalist Zheng Chenggong (Koxianga) and ruled the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan from 1662 to 1681. Following his father's sudden death, Zheng Jing inherited control of Taiwan and the Pescadores Islands, as well as coastal strongholds in Fujian, making him one of the most powerful maritime leaders in East Asia during the early Qing dynasty. His reign was marked by ongoing resistance against Qing rule in mainland China, the consolidation of Han Chinese settlement in Taiwan, and complex diplomatic maneuvering with the Qing court. Despite facing internal challenges and military setbacks, Zheng Jing maintained Taiwan as an independent kingdom for nearly two decades, though his rule is often viewed as less successful than his father's legendary achievements. His death in 1681 precipitated a succession crisis that ultimately led to the Qing conquest of Taiwan in 1683.

## Early Life and Background

Zheng Jing was born on October 25, 1642, in Anping, Fujian Province, during the tumultuous final years of the Ming dynasty. He was the eldest son of Zheng Chenggong (known in the West as Koxinga) and his Japanese wife, Tagawa Matsu.[^1] Born into a powerful maritime family, Zheng Jing grew up during a period of intense political and military conflict as the Manchu Qing forces conquered China and the Ming loyalists fought desperately to restore their fallen dynasty.[^2]

His early education was typical of elite Chinese families, focusing on Confucian classics, military strategy, and the administration required of a future leader. However, his formative years were overshadowed by constant warfare and his father's obsessive campaign to restore the Ming dynasty.[^3] The Zheng family controlled a vast maritime empire based on trade and naval power, stretching from Japan to Southeast Asia, which provided both wealth and military resources for their anti-Qing resistance.[^4]

In 1661, while Zheng Jing was still in his late teens, his father launched the famous invasion of Dutch-controlled Taiwan (then called Formosa), successfully expelling the Dutch East India Company after a nine-month siege of Fort Zeelandia.[^5] This conquest would prove pivotal to Zheng Jing's future, as Taiwan became the stronghold of the Zheng regime and the last bastion of Ming loyalist resistance.

However, Zheng Jing's early adulthood was marred by scandal. While his father was campaigning in Taiwan, Zheng Jing allegedly had an affair with his wet nurse in Xiamen, which resulted in the birth of a son, Zheng Keshuang.[^6] When Zheng Chenggong learned of this relationship, he was furious and ordered Zheng Jing's execution for this violation of Confucian moral codes. Only the intervention of senior officials and family members prevented the execution, though Zheng Jing's younger brother Zheng Xi was killed as punishment for failing to report the affair.[^7]

## Rise to Power

Zheng Jing's path to power was sudden and contested. On June 23, 1662, Zheng Chenggong died unexpectedly in Taiwan at the age of 38, possibly from malaria or exhaustion from his relentless military campaigns.[^8] His death created an immediate succession crisis, as he had not clearly designated an heir, and the legitimacy question surrounding Zheng Jing's conduct remained unresolved.[^9]

At the time of his father's death, Zheng Jing was stationed in Xiamen (Amoy) commanding the mainland territories, while his younger brother Zheng Xi held Taiwan. The Zheng family's senior advisors were divided: some supported Zheng Jing as the eldest son despite his moral transgression, while others favored younger brothers or wanted to establish a collective leadership.[^10] The Qing government, recognizing an opportunity, offered generous terms to any Zheng family member willing to submit and surrender their territories.[^11]

Zheng Jing moved decisively to secure his position. He mobilized his forces in Xiamen and gained the support of key military commanders and the powerful admiral Zhou Quanbin.[^12] When opposition emerged from Taiwan, including from officials who questioned his legitimacy, Zheng Jing moved to suppress dissent. The most significant challenge came from his uncle Zheng Tai, who controlled important military forces and opposed Zheng Jing's succession.[^13]

In a series of swift political maneuvers and military actions, Zheng Jing eliminated rivals and consolidated power. He had several opposing officials executed and forced others into submission.[^14] By late 1662, he had secured control over both the Taiwan base and the remaining coastal strongholds in Fujian, though this required ruthless suppression of internal opposition that would haunt his reign.[^15]

His assumption of power was formalized when he took the title of "Prince of Yanping" (延平王), the same title his father had held, and positioned himself as the legitimate successor to the Zheng maritime kingdom and the Ming loyalist cause.[^16] However, the violent nature of his succession and the execution of rivals created lasting resentment among some factions within the Zheng organization.[^17]

## Major Achievements

Despite the controversial circumstances of his rise to power, Zheng Jing achieved several significant accomplishments during his two-decade rule of the Kingdom of Tungning. His most notable achievement was successfully maintaining Taiwan as an independent kingdom for 19 years in the face of persistent Qing pressure and occasional military campaigns aimed at conquering the island.[^18]

Zheng Jing significantly expanded and consolidated Han Chinese settlement in Taiwan. Under his rule, tens of thousands of Chinese settlers arrived from Fujian and other coastal provinces, establishing agricultural communities, developing irrigation systems, and transforming Taiwan from a largely aboriginal island into a predominantly Han Chinese society.[^19] He implemented land distribution policies that encouraged cultivation and established a system of military colonies (tuntian) where soldiers farmed land when not on active duty.[^20]

In 1663, Zheng Jing launched a major military offensive to recover lost territories on the mainland, attacking and briefly recapturing several coastal cities in Fujian province. Though ultimately unable to hold these territories permanently, these campaigns demonstrated that the Zheng regime remained a formidable military force capable of challenging Qing authority.[^21] He maintained a powerful navy that controlled crucial maritime trade routes and continued the Zheng family's tradition of commercial dominance in East Asian waters.[^22]

One of Zheng Jing's most ambitious ventures was the Revolt of the Three Feudatories (1673-1681), when three powerful Chinese generals who had aided the Qing conquest of China rebelled against Manchu rule. Zheng Jing saw this as a golden opportunity to restore Ming rule and formed an alliance with the rebel forces, particularly with Geng Jingzhong in Fujian.[^23] In 1674, Zheng Jing launched a massive naval invasion of the mainland with over 100,000 troops and 3,000 ships, recapturing large portions of Fujian and Guangdong provinces.[^24]

During this campaign, Zheng Jing's forces captured major cities including Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Haicheng, and at the peak of his power controlled much of coastal southern China.[^25] He established administrative systems in the conquered territories and attempted to restore Ming-era governance structures, presenting himself as a legitimate Ming loyalist rather than a mere warlord.[^26] This represented the high point of his military career and the closest the Ming restoration movement came to success during his lifetime.

Zheng Jing also maintained diplomatic relations with various regional powers. He continued trade relations with Japan despite the latter's closed-country policy, exchanged envoys with the Philippines under Spanish rule, and maintained commercial networks throughout Southeast Asia.[^27] These relationships provided crucial revenue and supplies for his kingdom and demonstrated his regime's international recognition.[^28]

In terms of cultural development, Zheng Jing supported Confucian scholarship and education in Taiwan, establishing schools and promoting classical learning as a way to legitimize his regime and maintain Chinese cultural identity among the settler population.[^29] He patronized scholars who had fled the Qing conquest and maintained the Ming cultural tradition in Taiwan, making the island a refuge for Ming loyalist intellectuals.[^30]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Zheng Jing's reign was marked by significant controversies and military failures that diminished his historical reputation, especially in comparison to his legendary father. The most persistent criticism concerned his personal conduct and the scandal that nearly cost him his life before he assumed power. The relationship with his wet nurse violated fundamental Confucian moral principles and was seen as evidence of weak character and poor judgment by contemporary observers.[^31] This moral failing was frequently cited by critics to question his legitimacy as a ruler and leader of the Ming restoration cause.[^32]

His consolidation of power through violent purges created lasting divisions within the Zheng organization. The executions of rivals and opponents, while politically effective in the short term, bred resentment and distrust among military officers and civil officials.[^33] Many historians argue that this internal discord weakened the regime's cohesion and contributed to its eventual collapse after his death.[^34]

Zheng Jing's military leadership during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, initially successful, ultimately ended in catastrophic failure. After his impressive advances in 1674-1675, Qing forces under the brilliant general Kangxi Emperor's commanders began a systematic counteroffensive.[^35] By 1676, Zheng Jing had lost most of his mainland conquests and was forced into a humiliating retreat back to Taiwan.[^36] The withdrawal was disorderly, with heavy casualties and the loss of crucial military equipment and supplies.[^37]

Critics argued that Zheng Jing's strategic decisions during this campaign were flawed. He allegedly overextended his forces, failed to consolidate his territorial gains properly, and made tactical errors that allowed Qing forces to defeat his armies piecemeal.[^38] Some military historians suggest he lacked his father's tactical brilliance and failed to adapt to the changing military situation as Qing forces grew stronger.[^39]

After his return to Taiwan in 1676, Zheng Jing faced accusations of becoming increasingly despotic and indulgent. Historical sources describe him as falling into patterns of heavy drinking and neglecting state affairs.[^40] Contemporary records suggest he relied heavily on favorites and allowed corruption to flourish in his administration, leading to decline in governmental efficiency and military readiness.[^41]

The economic policies of his later reign also drew criticism. The costs of the failed mainland campaigns depleted the kingdom's treasury, and Zheng Jing allegedly imposed heavy taxes on the Taiwanese population to fund his lifestyle and maintain his military forces.[^42] Some sources claim he monopolized profitable trade routes for personal enrichment rather than state benefit.[^43]

Zheng Jing's treatment of indigenous Taiwanese peoples has also been criticized by modern historians. While he expanded Han Chinese settlement and agriculture, this came at the expense of aboriginal communities who were displaced from their traditional lands.[^44] The Zheng regime's policies accelerated the marginalization of Taiwan's indigenous peoples, a process with lasting negative consequences.[^45]

---

## Personal Life

Zheng Jing's personal life was complex and often controversial. His most infamous relationship was with his wet nurse, whose name is recorded in some sources as Chen Changqing.[^46] This relationship, which began when Zheng Jing was a young man, produced a son named Zheng Keshuang in 1670, who would later succeed him as ruler of Taiwan.[^47] The scandal surrounding this relationship nearly cost Zheng Jing his life and permanently damaged his reputation among strict Confucian observers.

After becoming ruler, Zheng Jing took several wives and concubines, following the traditional practice of Chinese elite families. Historical records mention Princess Ningjing, who became one of his principal consorts, though details about his family life are relatively sparse in surviving sources.[^48] He fathered multiple children, including several sons who would become involved in the succession struggle after his death.[^49]

Contemporary accounts describe Zheng Jing as physically imposing and charismatic in his youth, qualities that helped him command loyalty from his troops.[^50] However, various sources also characterize him as quick-tempered and prone to violent outbursts, particularly when drunk.[^51] These personality traits allegedly worsened as he aged, contributing to erratic decision-making in his later years.

Despite his moral controversies, Zheng Jing maintained the family's commitment to Ming loyalism and Confucian values in official capacities. He continued the practice of using Ming calendar dates rather than Qing era names, wore Ming-style robes and official regalia, and insisted on Ming court protocols in his administration.[^52] This adherence to Ming traditions was both a political statement of resistance and a source of legitimacy for his regime.[^53]

Zheng Jing was reportedly interested in literature and the arts, patronizing poets and scholars who had fled the Qing conquest.[^54] He maintained a court that attempted to recreate Ming cultural refinement in Taiwan, though critics suggested this was more performance than genuine intellectual engagement.[^55] His relationship with the Confucian scholar Chen Yonghua, who served as his chief advisor for many years, was particularly important in shaping administrative policies and cultural life in Taiwan.[^56]

In his final years, Zheng Jing's health deteriorated, possibly due to excessive drinking and the stress of military failures and political pressures.[^57] He died on March 17, 1681, at the age of 38, the same age as his father at death.[^58] The official cause of death was recorded as illness, though some historical sources hint at possible poisoning or other suspicious circumstances.[^59]

## Legacy

Zheng Jing's legacy is complex and contested, often overshadowed by his more famous father but nonetheless significant in Taiwanese and Chinese history. His most enduring achievement was maintaining Taiwan as an independent kingdom for nearly two decades, during which the island was transformed from a frontier outpost into a settled Chinese society.[^60] The administrative structures, settlement patterns, and cultural institutions established during his reign laid crucial foundations for Taiwan's subsequent development.[^61]

The massive influx of Han Chinese settlers during Zheng Jing's rule fundamentally altered Taiwan's demographic composition and established the cultural character that would persist for centuries.[^62] Cities like Tainan (then the capital, Cheng Tien Fu) grew substantially, agricultural production expanded dramatically, and Chinese social institutions took root across the island.[^63] In this sense, Zheng Jing was instrumental in the "sinification" of Taiwan, for better or worse depending on perspective.[^64]

However, Zheng Jing's death precipitated a devastating succession crisis that quickly destroyed the kingdom he had maintained. His son Zheng Keshuang, born of the controversial relationship with his wet nurse, was only 12 years old when he inherited the throne.[^65] The regent Feng Xifan consolidated power and executed Zheng Jing's other sons and potential rivals, creating chaos and resentment within the regime.[^66] This internal turmoil fatally weakened the kingdom just as the Qing prepared their final conquest.[^67]

Within two years of Zheng Jing's death, the Qing naval forces under Admiral Shi Lang—himself a former Zheng officer who had defected—launched a massive invasion of Taiwan. The Battle of Penghu in 1683 resulted in a decisive Qing victory, and young Zheng Keshuang surrendered Taiwan to Qing rule, ending the Kingdom of Tungning and the last organized Ming loyalist resistance.[^68] Many historians argue that the weakness exposed after Zheng Jing's death made this conquest possible and relatively easy.[^69]

In traditional Chinese historiography, Zheng Jing is often portrayed negatively, especially in comparison to his father. Qing dynasty historians depicted him as a morally corrupt and militarily incompetent ruler whose personal failings doomed the Ming restoration cause.[^70] This harsh assessment was partly Qing propaganda designed to delegitimize Ming loyalism, but it also reflected genuine disappointments with his leadership.[^71]

In Taiwan, Zheng Jing's historical reputation has evolved over time. During the Japanese colonial period (1895-1945), he was sometimes invoked as a symbol of resistance to foreign rule.[^72] In the post-World War II era, particularly under Nationalist (KMT) rule, Zheng Jing was incorporated into narratives of Chinese anti-Qing resistance and Taiwan's historical connection to mainland China.[^73] More recently, some Taiwanese historians have reassessed his role in establishing permanent Han Chinese settlement in Taiwan, though this remains controversial given implications for indigenous peoples.[^74]

The Kingdom of Tungning that Zheng Jing ruled has taken on symbolic significance in debates about Taiwan's political status and identity. For some, it represents Taiwan's history of de facto independence from mainland control; for others, it exemplifies Taiwan's integral connection to Chinese history and culture.[^75] These competing interpretations ensure that Zheng Jing remains a relevant figure in contemporary political discourse.[^76]

Zheng Jing's administrative innovations, particularly the land settlement system and military colony approach, influenced Taiwan's development for generations.[^77] The basic administrative divisions and settlement patterns established during his reign persisted well into the Qing period and shaped the island's geographic organization.[^78]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Zheng Jing favorably emphasize his achievement in maintaining Taiwan's independence during extremely challenging circumstances. Historian John E. Wills Jr. argues that Zheng Jing "successfully preserved the Zheng regime through nearly two decades of Qing pressure, maintaining a viable state structure and military force that remained a significant strategic challenge to the Manchu empire."[^79] This perspective highlights the difficulty of his position and the sophisticated diplomatic and military balancing required to survive.

Some historians credit Zheng Jing with transforming Taiwan from a temporary refuge into a sustainable kingdom with functioning institutions. Taiwanese historian Ts'ao Yung-ho has written that Zheng Jing "consolidated the Zheng family's hold on Taiwan and promoted agricultural development and Chinese settlement that laid the foundation for the island's future prosperity."[^80] This view emphasizes his role as a state-builder rather than merely a military leader.

Defenders of Zheng Jing point out that his military failures during the Revolt of the Three Feudatories occurred against a vastly superior enemy once the Qing consolidated their resources. Military historian Peter Lorge suggests that "Zheng Jing's campaigns demonstrated remarkable initial success and that his eventual defeat resulted more from the overwhelming resources of the Qing empire than from personal military incompetence."[^81] From this perspective, his achievements in the face of such odds deserve recognition.

Some scholars appreciate Zheng Jing's role in preserving Ming culture and Confucian scholarship in Taiwan. Cultural historian Angela Schottenhammer notes that "under Zheng Jing's patronage, Taiwan became a haven for Ming loyalist scholars and intellectuals, preserving cultural traditions and classical learning that might otherwise have been lost during the transition to Qing rule."[^82] This cultural legacy extends beyond mere political resistance to encompass intellectual preservation.

Recent scholarship has also recognized Zheng Jing's administrative capabilities in governing a multi-ethnic maritime kingdom. Historian Tonio Andrade observes that "Zheng Jing managed a complex state apparatus that administered Chinese settlers, aboriginal communities, and international trade networks, demonstrating considerable organizational skill."[^83] This administrative achievement required sophisticated governance that went beyond military matters.

### Negative Views

Critics of Zheng Jing emphasize his moral failings and argue these reflected fundamental character flaws that undermined his leadership. Traditional Chinese historians like those contributing to the *Mingshi* (History of Ming Dynasty) portrayed him as morally corrupt, writing that "Zheng Jing violated the fundamental principles of filial piety and Confucian morality, marking him as unfit to lead the righteous cause of Ming restoration."[^84] This moral condemnation shaped centuries of Chinese historical assessment.

Military historians critical of Zheng Jing point to his strategic failures during the Three Feudatories campaign as evidence of incompetence. Historian Frederic Wakeman Jr. argues that "Zheng Jing squandered the best opportunity for Ming restoration through poor strategic planning, failure to coordinate effectively with rebel allies, and premature overextension of his forces."[^85] From this perspective, his military leadership was catastrophically inadequate at the crucial moment.

Some scholars blame Zheng Jing for the rapid collapse of the kingdom after his death. Historian Jonathan Manthorpe writes that "Zheng Jing's failure to establish clear succession procedures and his inability to maintain unity among the Zheng leadership created the conditions for the regime's swift disintegration and Qing conquest."[^86] This criticism suggests his political legacy was ultimately destructive.

Critics also highlight Zheng Jing's alleged personal decline in his later years. Contemporary sources and later historians describe increasing alcoholism, nepotism, and neglect of state affairs. Historian Lynn A. Struve notes that "accounts from Zheng regime officials describe a ruler increasingly detached from governance, delegating power to favorites while indulging in personal pleasures."[^87] If accurate, this represents a serious failure of leadership.

Modern scholars critical of Chinese colonialism in Taiwan view Zheng Jing's settlement policies negatively. Historian Melissa J. Brown argues that "Zheng Jing's aggressive promotion of Han Chinese settlement and agriculture accelerated the displacement and marginalization of Taiwan's indigenous peoples, establishing patterns of colonization that had lasting harmful effects."[^88] This perspective situates Zheng Jing within a framework of colonial exploitation rather than state-building.

Some historians suggest that Zheng Jing lacked the ideological commitment to Ming restoration that his father possessed. Historian Frederic E. Wakeman writes that by Zheng Jing's reign, "the Ming loyalist cause had become more rhetorical than substantive, serving primarily to legitimize what was essentially a regional maritime kingdom pursuing its own interests."[^89] This critique questions the sincerity of his stated political mission.
