## Summary

The Mudan Incident refers to the collective victims and leaders involved in a series of interconnected events between 1871 and 1874 that profoundly shaped East Asian geopolitics. On December 12, 1871, 54 Ryukyuan sailors were killed by Paiwan indigenous peoples near Taiwan's southern tip after a shipwreck, triggering Japan's first overseas military expedition in 1874.[^1] The incident's victims included both the shipwrecked Ryukyuan sailors and Paiwan warriors who died defending their territory, while leaders such as Paiwan chief Aruqu Kavulungan and Japanese commander Saigō Tsugumichi played pivotal roles. This event became a turning point in Asian history, leading to Japan's annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom, transforming Qing China's approach to Taiwan, and establishing precedents in international law and sovereignty disputes.[^2]

## Early Life and Background

### The Ryukyuan Victims

The 54 Ryukyuan sailors who perished in 1871 were tribute mission participants from the Ryukyu Kingdom, which existed simultaneously as a tributary state of both Qing China and Japan's Satsuma Domain.[^3] On November 30, 1871, four Ryukyuan tributary ships departed from Shuri, Okinawa, bound for Miyako Island and the Yaeyama Islands. The vessels carried 69 passengers, including representatives from various social classes within Ryukyuan society.[^4] Among the victims, only one name has been prominently preserved in historical records: Nohara Chamu, whose descendant Nohara Koei later became a karate instructor in Urasoe, Okinawa.[^5]

The survivor Shimabukuro Kame, whose father was among the victims, served as an important informant concerning the incident. He and his father were lower-class samurais without salary living at Shuri, and five victims total came from Shuri.[^6] The ships were caught by a typhoon on December 12, 1871, and one vessel shipwrecked off the southeastern coast of Taiwan near Padiyudr Bay, with three passengers dying while attempting to reach shore.[^7] The remaining 66 survivors wandered inland, unknowingly entering Paiwan territorial boundaries near what is now Kenting in Hengchun, Pingtung County.

### The Paiwan Indigenous People

The Paiwan people, Taiwan's second-largest indigenous group with 96,334 members as of 2014, inhabited the southern chain of the Central Mountain Range from Damumu Mountain to the Hengchun Peninsula.[^8] Paiwan society operated under a sophisticated hierarchical system characterized by first-child succession, where the eldest child—regardless of gender—inherited family property and leadership responsibilities.[^9] Chiefs held paramount status, managing tribal welfare and resources, while society maintained clear distinctions between nobles, officials, and commoners, demonstrating equal gender rights uncommon in neighboring societies.

Paiwan culture treasured three sacred objects known as the "Three Paiwan Treasures": pottery pots, glass beads, and bronze knives. According to Paiwan legend, their ancestors were born from pottery pots, making this implement a symbol of origin and cultural identity.[^10] The tribe practiced important ceremonies including Masalut (harvest celebration) and Maljeveq (ancestor commemoration), with shamanism transmitted through bloodlines playing a central role in spiritual life.[^11]

### Paiwan Leaders

Aruqu Kavulungan (卓杞篤), also transliterated as Agulu or Aruq, served as chief of the Mudan village during the critical period.[^12] He led his people according to traditional Paiwan values of territorial sovereignty and hospitality customs that foreign visitors misunderstood with tragic consequences. His unnamed son, who would die alongside him in 1874, represented the continuation of Paiwan leadership through the first-child succession system.[^13] Other regional leaders included Chief Issa (伊厝), head of the sixteen southern tribes, and Tanketok (also known as Tok-a-Tok or Tauketok), who had previously negotiated with American consul Charles Le Gendre following the 1867 Rover Incident.[^14]

## Rise to Prominence

### The 1871 Shipwreck and Killings

The Mudan Incident began when the 66 Ryukyuan survivors, disoriented and desperate after their shipwreck, entered the Kuskus tribal area (now Gaoshi Village of Mudan Township) without understanding local protocols.[^15] According to Mudan researcher interpretations, the killings resulted not from hatred but from profound linguistic and cultural misunderstandings.[^16] A Mudan local explained that the 66 men who could not understand local languages entered Kuskus and began taking food and drink—actions that violated village boundaries despite food-sharing being a local symbol of protection and friendship when properly offered.[^17]

The Paiwan perspective, largely excluded from historical narratives for over a century, suggests the community acted defensively against what they perceived as threatening intrusions. The survivors' actions may have been misinterpreted as hostile, particularly given earlier incidents where foreigners had killed members of the Kulaljuc tribe, creating existing tensions.[^18] Ultimately, 54 Ryukyuans were killed, while 12 survivors were rescued by local Han Chinese who transferred them to Taiwan Prefecture (modern Tainan) before their return to Miyako Island.[^19]

### International Ramifications

The incident's significance transcended its immediate tragedy due to the Ryukyu Kingdom's unique political status. Because Ryukyu maintained tributary relationships with both Qing China and Satsuma Japan, the massacre created diplomatic ambiguity that Japan would strategically exploit.[^20] Japan claimed the victims as "Japanese nationals," providing justification for military intervention despite Ryukyu's complex dual allegiance. The Qing government initially dismissed the incident, stating that Taiwan's indigenous peoples existed "outside the sphere of civilization" (huawai zhimin) and therefore outside Chinese jurisdiction—a position Japan would manipulate through Western international law interpretations.[^21]

The precedent had been set four years earlier during the 1867 Rover Incident, when the American merchant ship Rover wrecked off Taiwan's coast and fourteen Americans, including Captain Joseph Hunt and his wife Mercy, were killed by Paiwan people in revenge for earlier foreign killings of tribe members.[^22] American consul Charles Le Gendre subsequently negotiated a treaty with chief Tauketok in November 1867, guaranteeing future shipwreck survivors' safety—an agreement that notably did not extend to the 1871 Ryukyuan victims, possibly due to communication gaps or territorial distinctions between Paiwan groups.[^23]

## Major Events and the 1874 Expedition

### Japanese Military Response

On April 26, 1874, Lieutenant General Saigō Tsugumichi, younger brother of the famous samurai Saigō Takamori, received orders from the Meiji government to halt the Taiwan expedition at the last moment.[^24] In an early act of military disobedience that would establish precedents for future Japanese military culture, Saigō defied his political leaders and proceeded with the invasion.[^25] Some 3,600 Japanese troops first landed on Taiwanese shores on May 2, 1874, marking the first overseas deployment of the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy.[^26]

The Japanese forces employed both military action and diplomatic maneuvering. Captain Cassel negotiated with Chief Issa, who claimed the "Botans" (Mudan people) operated outside his control and gave Japanese forces consent to punish them as they wished—a politically expedient position that may have reflected inter-tribal dynamics or coercion.[^27] The Japanese learned that Tanketok had died, removing a significant diplomatic intermediary who had previously established relationships with Western representatives.[^28]

### The Battle of Stone Gate

The decisive engagement occurred on May 22, 1874, when Japanese soldiers dislodged Paiwan defenders from commanding heights guarding the pass into Pingdong County's mountainous interior at the Battle of Stone Gate (Shimen).[^29] Japanese casualties counted six killed and thirty wounded, though initial reports varied.[^30] Paiwan casualties proved more difficult to document accurately, with Japanese tallies ranging from fifteen to thirty-eight indigenous warriors killed, while other sources stated thirty tribesmen were either killed or mortally wounded.[^31]

Among the Paiwan dead were Chief Aruqu Kavulungan and his son, representing not just military casualties but the destruction of generational leadership continuity central to Paiwan social structure.[^32] The battle demonstrated asymmetric warfare dynamics, with Paiwan forces utilizing intimate territorial knowledge and defensive positioning against numerically and technologically superior Japanese forces equipped with modern weapons. Historical records indicate Japanese forces seized the skulls of twelve Paiwan warriors following the battle, transporting them as trophies—first to Japan through an American military adviser, then through two other owners before their donation to the University of Edinburgh in 1907.[^33]

### Diplomatic Resolution

While military operations continued, diplomatic efforts accelerated in Beijing. Toshimichi Ōkubo arrived in Beijing on September 10, 1874, initiating seven negotiating sessions over a month-long period.[^34] Through skillful use of foreign diplomats—especially British minister Thomas Wade as intermediary—Ōkubo secured favorable terms for Japan.[^35] Western Powers, particularly Britain, pressured China to avoid bloodshed that would negatively impact coastal trade, creating diplomatic leverage Japan exploited.[^36]

The resulting Peking Agreement, signed on October 30, 1874, required Qing China to pay an indemnity of 500,000 taels to Japan.[^37] Critically, the treaty's ambiguous wording acknowledged Japan's expedition as a "just" action to protect "its subjects," implicitly recognizing Japanese authority over Ryukyu.[^38] Some diplomatic historians argue China inadvertently renounced suzerainty over the Ryukyu Islands through this language, paving the way for de facto Japanese incorporation of Ryukyu in 1879.[^39] Japan's forces withdrew from Taiwan in December 1874, but the expedition's success had achieved multiple strategic objectives beyond immediate military victory.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Japanese Imperial Expansion

The Mudan Incident expedition is widely criticized as a pretext for Japanese imperial expansion rather than genuine justice for Ryukyuan victims.[^40] Japan manipulated Western concepts of international law to justify territorial aggression, arguing that Hengchun constituted terra nullius—essentially unclaimed territory—while simultaneously asserting sovereignty over the Ryukyus as Japan's southernmost domain.[^41] This represented cynical legal maneuvering that disregarded both Qing claims and indigenous Paiwan sovereignty, prioritizing Japanese strategic interests over genuine international legal principles.

The expedition established dangerous precedents for military disobedience within Japanese armed forces. Saigō Tsugumichi's decision to proceed despite government orders to halt created patterns where military commanders felt entitled to override civilian authority when pursuing perceived national interests—a dynamic that would contribute to Japanese militarism in subsequent decades.[^42] The Taiwan expedition's success reinforced beliefs that autonomous military action could achieve strategic gains even when contradicting official policy, undermining civilian control mechanisms.

Furthermore, the treatment of Paiwan remains—seizing skulls as trophies and displaying them in foreign institutions for over a century—exemplifies colonial-era dehumanization of indigenous peoples.[^43] These practices violated cultural sanctity and demonstrated contempt for Paiwan beliefs about ancestral spirits and proper treatment of the deceased, adding cultural violence to military aggression.

### Qing Dynasty Failures

The Qing government's response revealed profound weaknesses in administering Taiwan and protecting both indigenous peoples and shipwreck survivors. The initial dismissal of the 1871 killings, characterizing indigenous territories as "outside the sphere of civilization," demonstrated administrative neglect that created the diplomatic vacuum Japan exploited.[^44] This position contradicted China's sovereignty claims, essentially abandoning responsibility for events within territories ostensibly under Qing control.

Shen Baozhen, appointed to respond to the Japanese invasion, faced severe difficulties assembling adequate forces. Not arriving until June 21, 1874—after major battles had concluded—he eventually gathered only 6,500 troops by September and 10,000 troops by November, never intercepting Japanese forces or taking decisive military action.[^45] This ineffectual response demonstrated the Qing military's inability to project power into peripheral territories, encouraging further foreign encroachment.

The treaty negotiations revealed diplomatic weakness, with Western Powers pressuring China to accept unfavorable terms prioritizing foreign trade interests over Chinese sovereignty or indigenous rights.[^46] China's payment of 500,000 taels indemnity and acceptance of language implicitly acknowledging Japanese authority over Ryukyu represented diplomatic defeats with long-term territorial consequences.

### Impact on Indigenous Peoples

The Paiwan people suffered disproportionately despite being marginalized in historical narratives. Both Paiwan villages involved were burned down during Japanese operations, destroying homes, food stores, and cultural sites.[^47] The deaths of Chief Aruqu Kavulungan and his son disrupted leadership succession, while the killing of at least sixteen warriors (and possibly thirty-eight by some accounts) represented significant population loss for relatively small communities.[^48]

Following Japanese withdrawal, the chastened Qing government embarked on programs to "open the mountains and pacify the barbarians" in Paiwan territory, extending administrative control and transportation networks that further encroached on indigenous autonomy.[^49] This intensified Chinese settlement and resource extraction, fundamentally transforming Paiwan lands and lifeways. Shen Baozhen explicitly recommended "subjugating the aborigines and populating their territory with Chinese settlers to prevent Japanese encroachment"—a policy prioritizing strategic security over indigenous rights.[^50]

For over a century, the Paiwan perspective remained excluded from historical records, which portrayed them as "murderous savages" who triggered international crises through uncivilized violence.[^51] This narrative erasure denied Paiwan agency, cultural context, and legitimate defensive actions, perpetuating colonial frameworks that dismissed indigenous sovereignty and territorial rights.

## Personal Lives and Cultural Context

### Ryukyuan Sailors' Backgrounds

The Ryukyuan victims represented diverse social backgrounds within the kingdom's hierarchical society. Shimabukuro Kame and his father exemplified lower-class samurais without salary living in Shuri, the capital city.[^52] Five victims total came from Shuri, while the majority originated from Miyako Island and the Yaeyama Islands—more remote territories where maritime skills and inter-island commerce provided primary livelihoods.[^53]

These men participated in the tributary system that defined Ryukyuan political economy for centuries. Tribute missions to China represented both diplomatic obligation and commercial opportunity, carrying goods for trade while fulfilling ceremonial requirements. The November 1871 journey, departing just before winter storms, reflected the calculated risks Ryukyuan sailors regularly accepted navigating the East China Sea's dangerous waters.[^54] Their families, left waiting for returning vessels that would never arrive, experienced devastating losses—not just of loved ones but often primary income sources for household survival.

The twelve survivors who reached Han Chinese settlements and eventually returned to Miyako carried traumatic memories and testimony that shaped Japanese diplomatic narratives. Their accounts, filtered through translators and political agendas, became evidence in international negotiations that instrumentalized their suffering for geopolitical purposes they likely never anticipated.[^55]

### Paiwan Leaders and Warriors

Chief Aruqu Kavulungan embodied Paiwan leadership traditions emphasizing communal welfare, territorial stewardship, and maintenance of cultural protocols.[^56] As a noble in Paiwan society's hierarchical structure, he inherited responsibilities through the first-child succession system, likely training from youth in decision-making, conflict resolution, and ceremonial duties. His decision-making during the 1871 encounter with Ryukyuan sailors reflected attempts to protect tribal boundaries and respond to perceived threats based on previous negative experiences with foreign intruders.

The unnamed son who died alongside Aruqu represented generational continuity central to Paiwan social organization. As the first-born, he would have inherited his father's position and property, receiving education in leadership, spiritual practices, and cultural knowledge preservation.[^57] Their joint deaths severed this continuity, creating succession challenges and leadership voids during the critical period when the community faced Japanese military pressure and subsequent Qing administrative expansion.

The twelve Paiwan warriors whose skulls were seized by Japanese forces represented the community's defensive capabilities and willingness to protect their homeland despite technological disadvantages. These men likely possessed deep knowledge of local terrain, tracking skills, and combat traditions—expertise that proved insufficient against modern firearms and larger Japanese forces.[^58] Their remains' journey from battlefield trophy to Edinburgh University collection to eventual 2023 repatriation symbolizes the long arc from colonial violence to contemporary justice efforts.

### Cultural Misunderstandings

The tragic encounter between Ryukyuan sailors and Paiwan people exemplifies how cultural protocols, when misunderstood across linguistic barriers, can escalate to fatal violence. Paiwan hospitality traditions involved specific procedures for requesting food and protection, likely including acknowledgment of territorial boundaries and seeking permission from village leaders.[^59] The shipwrecked sailors, desperate and disoriented, apparently violated these protocols unknowingly—taking food and drink that, when offered through proper channels, symbolized protection and friendship but, when taken without permission, constituted threatening intrusions.

This cultural collision occurred within historical context of previous foreign violence against Paiwan communities, including the 1867 Rover Incident aftermath. American military expeditions and foreign trading vessels had created patterns of hostile foreign presence that reasonably informed Paiwan defensive responses.[^60] The Ryukyuan sailors, despite their own victimization by the typhoon, inadvertently triggered defensive reactions shaped by these precedents.

## Legacy and Historical Impact

### Geopolitical Transformations

The Mudan Incident fundamentally reshaped East Asian political geography with consequences extending far beyond the original 54 Ryukyuan deaths. Japan's successful expedition demonstrated military capabilities and willingness to challenge the regional order, marking the first overseas deployment of Japanese imperial forces in what would become decades of expansion.[^61] The precedent established—using protection of nationals as justification for military intervention—would be repeatedly employed throughout Japan's imperial period.

The Ryukyu Kingdom lost its independence through processes the Mudan Incident accelerated. Japan ordered tributary relations with China to end in 1875 after perceiving the 1874 tribute mission as submission to China.[^62] In 1879, Japan formally annexed the kingdom and reorganized it as Okinawa Prefecture, erasing centuries of Ryukyuan independence and cultural distinctiveness.[^63] The Peking Agreement's ambiguous language provided legal cover for this annexation by implying Japanese sovereignty over Ryukyuan people.

For Taiwan, the incident ended Qing administrative neglect. The government transformed Taiwan from a neglected frontier into a more actively governed territory, upgrading it to provincial status in 1885 under Liu Mingchuan's leadership.[^64] However, these reforms came too late to prevent Japan's 1895 annexation of Taiwan following the First Sino-Japanese War, partly facilitated by the precedents established in 1874.

### International Law Precedents

The Mudan Incident marked a critical moment where Japan employed Western international legal concepts to challenge traditional East Asian tributary systems. Japan's justification for the expedition—protecting nationals in territories where local authorities failed to exercise control—reflected European imperial legal doctrines about sovereignty, jurisdiction, and state responsibility.[^65] This represented Meiji Japan's sophisticated adaptation of Western legal frameworks to advance territorial ambitions, demonstrating rapid modernization of diplomatic strategies alongside military capabilities.

The Qing government's characterization of indigenous territories as "outside the sphere of civilization" and therefore beyond Chinese jurisdiction created the legal vacuum Japan exploited. Japan argued that if China disclaimed responsibility for indigenous actions, then Taiwan's southern regions constituted terra nullius where Japan could legitimately intervene.[^66] When China subsequently claimed sovereignty during negotiations, Japan used this contradiction to extract favorable treaty terms acknowledging limited Chinese control and justifying the indemnity payment.

These legal manipulations established patterns where powerful states weaponized international law concepts to rationalize imperialism while claiming civilizational superiority over indigenous peoples. The Mudan Incident demonstrates how seemingly universal legal principles could be selectively applied to advance particular national interests rather than protecting vulnerable populations or establishing genuine justice.

### Indigenous Historical Justice

For over a century, the Mudan Incident narrative centered Japanese, Chinese, and Western perspectives while marginalizing Paiwan voices and experiences. Historical accounts portrayed Paiwan people as "savage" aggressors whose violence triggered international crises, denying cultural context, defensive motivations, and legitimate territorial sovereignty.[^67] This narrative erasure constituted ongoing violence, relegating Paiwan communities to historical footnotes in events that devastated their society.

Recent decades have witnessed gradual shifts toward indigenous-centered interpretations. Over the past twenty years, experts and locals have reconstructed historical narratives with the Paiwan as main subjects, challenging colonial frameworks that dominated previous scholarship.[^68] In November 2020, Mudan Township erected statues of Chief Aruqu Kavulungan and his son at the Mudan Incident Memorial Park, physically inscribing Paiwan leadership into public memory.[^69] The memorial's text, scratched off by the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) after World War II, was only restored in 2020, reflecting long struggles for indigenous recognition.[^70]

The November 2023 repatriation of four Paiwan warrior skulls by the University of Edinburgh represented a major milestone in historical justice and reconciliation.[^71] This marked Taiwan's first international repatriation of ancestral remains, carrying profound significance for indigenous communities seeking to honor ancestors and reclaim cultural heritage from colonial institutions.[^72] The traditional Paiwan ceremony performed during the handover, honoring the warriors' spirits before their return to ancestral lands, demonstrated the continuing spiritual significance of proper treatment for the deceased.[^73]

Contemporary Mudan Township leaders emphasize telling their own history from Paiwan perspectives. One leader stated: "I think Mudan is ready to tell its own history...from our perspective," acknowledging that renewed attention to the Mudan Incident as a pivotal moment in Asian and Taiwanese history means "locals cannot stay silent anymore."[^74] This represents indigenous communities reclaiming narrative authority over their histories, challenging dominant accounts that served colonial and national projects.

### Reconciliation Efforts

In 2005, Mudan Township people traveled to Ryukyu for "Love and Peace Century Reconciliation" exchange activities, expressing goodwill to Ryukyuan bereaved families.[^75] Together they erected a monument symbolizing eternal love and peace, transforming historical enmity into cross-cultural understanding. The first commemorative ceremony occurred at the Shimen battlefield in May 2002, and approximately 130 years after the violence, formal reconciliation was achieved between descendant communities.[^76]

An international symposium held November 24-25 in Mudan village brought together scholars and community members to examine the incident from multiple perspectives.[^77] Organized by Mudan tribe members "whose ancestors were both aggressors and victims during the incident," the symposium acknowledged complex positionalities that resist simple victim-perpetrator binaries, recognizing how Paiwan communities both inflicted violence on Ryukyuans and suffered violence from Japanese and Qing forces.

The 12-hectare Shimen Ancient Battlefield memorial park now provides educational opportunities for visitors to understand the incident through historical story walls, sculptures, and the Monument of Love and Peace.[^78] These memorialization efforts represent attempts to honor all victims—Ryukyuan sailors, Paiwan warriors, and communities disrupted by subsequent military and administrative actions—while providing spaces for reflection on colonialism, cultural misunderstanding, and paths toward reconciliation.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views and Indigenous Resistance Interpretation

Contemporary scholars emphasizing decolonial perspectives recognize the Paiwan response to the 1871 intrusion as legitimate defensive action protecting territorial sovereignty against unauthorized foreign presence.[^79] This interpretation challenges colonial-era characterizations of indigenous "savagery," instead contextualizing Paiwan actions within frameworks of self-determination, territorial rights, and response to previous foreign violence. The decision to resist what community members perceived as threatening intrusions reflected rational calculation based on experiences with hostile foreign traders and military expeditions.

Indigenous rights advocates view the Mudan Incident's Paiwan victims as casualties of imperialism who defended their homeland against superior military forces. The deaths of Chief Aruqu Kavulungan, his son, and fellow warriors represent sacrifice in pursuit of community protection and territorial integrity—values deserving recognition rather than denigration.[^80] Contemporary memorialization efforts, including the 2020 statues and 2023 skull repatriation, constitute overdue acknowledgment of indigenous perspectives long excluded from official histories.

Scholars of reconciliation and transitional justice praise recent efforts to incorporate Paiwan voices and establish dialogue between descendant communities. The Love and Peace monuments and cross-cultural exchanges between Mudan and Ryukyu communities demonstrate possibilities for healing historical wounds through mutual recognition of suffering and shared commitment to preventing future violence.[^81] These initiatives model indigenous-led reconciliation that centers affected communities rather than state interests.

Some historians emphasize how the incident revealed the bankruptcy of imperial systems—both Qing tributary arrangements and emerging Japanese imperialism—in protecting vulnerable populations or respecting indigenous sovereignty. The tragedy stemmed from great power competitions instrumentalizing local events for geopolitical purposes, sacrificing Ryukyuan sailors' lives and Paiwan territorial rights for strategic advantages neither community desired.[^82]

### Negative Views and Critical Assessments

Critics of Paiwan actions, while acknowledging cultural misunderstandings, question the proportionality of killing 54 shipwrecked sailors who posed limited genuine threat to the community. The Ryukyuans, desperate survivors of a maritime disaster, lacked military organization or aggressive intent—their violations of territorial protocols, while real, arguably warranted non-lethal responses such as expulsion or detention pending clarification.[^83] The decision to kill rather than seek alternative resolutions, some argue, reflected excessive defensive reactions that tragic consequences made unjustifiable.

Scholars critical of Japanese imperialism view the Mudan Incident as cynical exploitation of tragedy for territorial expansion. Japan's claimed concern for Ryukyuan victims rang hollow given subsequent annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom and decades of cultural suppression of Okinawan identity.[^84] The expedition's true purposes—establishing military precedents, asserting sovereignty over Ryukyu, testing Western reactions to Japanese expansion, and gaining Taiwan territory or influence—instrumentalized genuine suffering for imperial projects that brought no justice to actual victims.

The Qing government's failures draw harsh scholarly criticism for creating conditions enabling the tragedy through administrative neglect, inadequate shipwreck rescue systems, and absence of diplomatic relationships with indigenous communities.[^85] The dismissal of indigenous territories as beyond civilization while simultaneously claiming sovereignty demonstrated incoherent policy that invited foreign challenges. Subsequent brutal suppression campaigns against indigenous peoples under the "open the mountains and pacify the barbarians" programs revealed how the incident became pretext for intensified colonization rather than genuine protective governance.[^86]

International law scholars critique how the incident established precedents for weaponizing legal concepts to justify imperialism. Both Japan's terra nullius arguments and claims about protecting nationals in ungoverned spaces reflected selective application of Western legal doctrines that undermined rather than supported genuine international justice or indigenous rights.[^87] The Peking Agreement's ambiguous language enabled territorial seizures and sovereignty violations that contradicted principles of self-determination and legitimate sovereignty the legal frameworks ostensibly protected.

Contemporary indigenous activists emphasize that despite recent reconciliation efforts and memorialization, fundamental issues of indigenous sovereignty, land rights, and self-determination remain unresolved in Taiwan. The Mudan Incident's Paiwan descendants continue facing challenges including economic marginalization, cultural preservation struggles, and political underrepresentation—legacies of the colonial processes the 1874 expedition accelerated.[^88] True historical justice, these advocates argue, requires not just symbolic recognition but substantive restoration of indigenous rights and authority over ancestral territories.

## Cultural Memory and Commemoration

The Mudan Incident Memorial Park now serves as the primary site for collective memory, featuring a 12-hectare area near the Shimen Ancient Battlefield where decisive combat occurred.[^94] Historical story walls provide narrative context from multiple perspectives, while the Monument of Love and Peace symbolizes reconciliation between Mudan Paiwan and Ryukyu communities achieved through decades of dialogue. The 2020 statues of Chief Aruqu Kavulungan and his unnamed son stand on a hill overlooking the valley, physically elevating indigenous leaders into memorial landscapes previously dominated by Japanese and Chinese monuments.[^95]

The restoration of memorial text in 2020—originally inscribed but scratched off by the KMT after World War II—represents contested memory politics where different regimes attempted to control historical narratives. The KMT's erasure reflected discomfort with Japanese imperial history and possible desire to minimize indigenous resistance narratives, while restoration acknowledges the importance of preserving contested historical evidence even when politically uncomfortable.[^96]

Educational programming at the memorial site now emphasizes the incident as a "pivotal point in Asian history" rather than a peripheral colonial event, situating Taiwan's indigenous peoples as central actors in regional transformations.[^97] This pedagogical shift challenges nationalist narratives from both Chinese and Japanese perspectives that marginalized indigenous agency, instead recognizing how Paiwan decisions and resistance shaped great power responses and subsequent geopolitical realignments.

The November 2023 repatriation ceremony at the University of Edinburgh demonstrated evolving institutional approaches to colonial collections. The university's acknowledgment that holding indigenous remains constituted ongoing colonial violence, combined with full cooperation in repatriation including traditional Paiwan ceremonies, represents progress in addressing historical injustices through concrete institutional change rather than mere symbolic gestures.[^98] The warriors' temporary placement at the National Museum of Prehistory pending permanent resting place determination reflects ongoing consultation with Mudan communities about appropriate treatment, centering indigenous decision-making in processes affecting their ancestors.

Contemporary Paiwan artists and cultural workers increasingly engage the Mudan Incident through creative production, including poetry, visual art, and performance that challenge dominant historical narratives. Paiwan poet Malieyafusi Monaneng's work demonstrates how Indigenous writers employ literary production to assert survivance—active presence and cultural continuity—against colonial erasure, transforming historical trauma into vehicles for contemporary indigenous identity and political mobilization.[^99]

## Contemporary Significance

The Mudan Incident continues generating scholarly debate about colonialism, international law, indigenous rights, and historical justice. Academic conferences, including the November 2023 international symposium in Mudan village, bring together diverse perspectives examining the incident's multiple dimensions and contemporary relevance.[^100] These forums facilitate dialogue between indigenous communities, descendant populations, historians, legal scholars, and justice advocates, modeling collaborative approaches to contested histories.

Taiwan's indigenous movements cite the Mudan Incident when advocating for greater political autonomy, land rights restoration, and cultural preservation support. The 2022 announcement of the Paiwan National Assembly—pursuing concerted political action beyond token representation—reflects contemporary indigenous organizing that draws historical legitimacy from ancestors' resistance to foreign encroachment.[^101] Leaders explicitly connect 19th-century territorial defense to 21st-century sovereignty claims, demonstrating how historical events provide foundations for contemporary political mobilization.

International discussions of cultural repatriation increasingly reference the Edinburgh skull return as a positive model for institutional accountability and indigenous-led processes. The precedent encourages other institutions holding indigenous remains to initiate repatriation consultations, potentially facilitating returns of cultural property and ancestral remains held in museums and universities worldwide.[^102] Taiwan's Council of Indigenous Peoples characterized the repatriation as upholding principles from the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, connecting local events to global indigenous rights frameworks.

Sino-Japanese relations continue grappling with historical legacies the Mudan Incident established. Contemporary sovereignty disputes over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands and broader tensions over regional influence trace genealogies to the 1874 expedition's precedents regarding territorial claims, indigenous populations, and international law interpretations.[^103] Chinese officials occasionally reference the Mudan Incident when challenging Japanese territorial assertions, arguing that historical Japanese manipulation of Ryukyuan status delegitimizes contemporary Japanese claims to Okinawa and associated territories—though these arguments themselves often marginalize Okinawan/Ryukyuan perspectives and indigenous rights.

For Taiwan's complex identity politics, the Mudan Incident offers narrative resources for multiple political projects. Indigenous activists emphasize Paiwan sovereignty predating both Chinese and Japanese claims, supporting arguments for indigenous self-determination independent of cross-strait disputes.[^104] Taiwan independence advocates sometimes cite the incident as demonstrating Taiwan's distinct history from mainland China, while reunification proponents emphasize Qing territorial claims and Japanese aggression. These competing interpretations reflect how historical events become sites for contemporary political contestation, with different actors selectively appropriating aspects supporting their particular visions for Taiwan's future.
