## Overview

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis was the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression. Originating in the U.S. housing market, where reckless subprime mortgage lending had created a massive bubble, the crisis exploded in September 2008 with the collapse of Lehman Brothers—the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Within weeks, the global financial system froze, credit markets seized, stock markets crashed, and the world economy plunged into deep recession. Governments and central banks responded with unprecedented bailouts ($12+ trillion globally) and monetary intervention. The crisis discredited Wall Street, fueled populist movements, and reshaped financial regulation.

## Background

### Housing Bubble

**2001-2006:**
U.S. home prices doubled. Everyone believed prices only go up.

**Subprime Mortgages:**
Loans to buyers with poor credit, no income verification ("liar loans"), adjustable rates.

**Financial Innovation:**
Banks bundled mortgages into securities (MBS, CDOs), sold globally. Risk spread everywhere.

### Wall Street Excess

- Investment banks leveraged 30:1 or more
- Credit default swaps (CDS) created unregulated insurance market
- Rating agencies gave AAA ratings to junk
- Bonuses rewarded short-term risk-taking

---

## Warning Signs

**2006:**
Housing prices peaked, began declining.

**2007:**
- Subprime mortgage defaults rose
- Hedge funds collapsed (Bear Stearns funds, June 2007)
- BNP Paribas froze funds (August 2007)
- Northern Rock bank run (UK, September 2007)

---

## The Crisis

### Bear Stearns (March 2008)

**Collapse:**
Bear Stearns, major investment bank, faced run. Fed facilitated emergency sale to JPMorgan ($2/share).

### September 2008: The World Changed

**September 7:**
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (mortgage giants) nationalized.

**September 15:**
**Lehman Brothers filed bankruptcy.**
- 158-year-old firm
- $691 billion in assets
- Largest bankruptcy in history
- No bailout; allowed to fail

**Why Lehman Mattered:**
- Global counterparty to countless trades
- Money market fund "broke the buck"
- Credit markets froze worldwide
- Trust evaporated

**September 16:**
AIG (insurance giant) bailed out with $85 billion (eventually $182 billion).

**September 17:**
Money market funds saw mass withdrawals.

**September 19:**
Treasury Secretary Paulson proposed $700 billion bailout (TARP).

**September 29:**
House rejected TARP. Dow dropped 777 points (largest point drop ever).

**October 3:**
TARP passed after revision.

## Global Contagion

### Banks Worldwide

- **UK:** Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS needed government rescue
- **Ireland:** Entire banking system nationalized
- **Iceland:** All major banks collapsed; national bankruptcy
- **Europe:** Bank failures, recessions

- Unemployment soared (U.S.: 10%, Europe: 11%+)
- GDP contracted globally (2009)

---

## Government Response

### United States

**TARP ($700 billion):**
Treasury injected capital into banks.

**Federal Reserve:**
- Cut interest rates to 0%
- Quantitative Easing (QE): bought trillions in securities
- Lender of last resort

**Stimulus:**
Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ($787 billion, 2009).

## Aftermath

- Home prices fell 30%
- Millions foreclosed
- Retirement savings devastated

### Recovery

**Slow:**
U.S. returned to pre-crisis GDP by 2011. Employment took until 2014. Some countries (Greece, Italy) took decade+.

### Financial Reform

**Dodd-Frank Act (2010):**
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
- Volcker Rule (limited proprietary trading)
- Stress tests for banks
- "Too big to fail" addressed (partially)

---

## Who Was Punished?

### Bailouts But No Jail

**Banks Rescued:**
- Major banks repaid TARP (with profit to government)
- Bonuses resumed quickly
- No major executive imprisoned

**Public Anger:**
Wall Street got bailed out; Main Street did not.

### Only One Conviction

Kareem Serageldin (Credit Suisse) was only banker jailed directly for crisis-related crime.

## Long-Term Impact

### Economic

- Quantitative easing became normal
- Wealth inequality increased
- Precarious recovery

### Political

**Populism:**
- Tea Party (right)
- Occupy Wall Street (left)
- Brexit, Trump, Sanders

**Anti-Establishment:**
Distrust of elites, institutions.

### Financial Industry

- Banks consolidated (bigger than before)
- Shadow banking regulated
