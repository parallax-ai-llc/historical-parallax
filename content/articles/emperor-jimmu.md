## Summary

Emperor Jimmu (神武天皇, Jinmu-tennō) is the legendary first emperor of Japan and the founder of the Imperial House of Japan, according to traditional Japanese mythology and history. He is said to have ascended to the throne on February 11, 660 BCE, a date that became the basis for Japan's National Foundation Day. According to the ancient chronicles Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, Jimmu was a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu and undertook a military campaign from Kyushu to Yamato (present-day Nara Prefecture) to establish his rule. While his historical existence remains a subject of scholarly debate, Emperor Jimmu holds immense cultural and political significance in Japan as the symbolic founder of an unbroken imperial lineage that continues to the present day.

## Early Life and Background

According to the Kojiki (712 CE) and Nihon Shoki (720 CE), Japan's oldest historical chronicles, Emperor Jimmu was born as Kamu-yamato Iware-biko no Mikoto (神日本磐余彦尊). He was said to be the great-great-grandson of the goddess Amaterasu through her grandson Ninigi-no-Mikoto, who descended from the heavens to rule Japan. His father was Ugayafukiaezu no Mikoto, and his mother was Tamayori-hime, daughter of the sea god Watatsumi.

Traditional accounts place his birth in the region of Hyuga in Kyushu, the southernmost of Japan's main islands. As a young prince, Jimmu reportedly grew dissatisfied with ruling from the periphery of the Japanese archipelago and conceived a plan to move eastward to establish a capital in a more central location. The chronicles describe him as ambitious, courageous, and possessing divine qualities inherited from his celestial ancestry.

The mythology surrounding Jimmu's early life emphasizes his divine lineage and destiny to rule. According to tradition, he was chosen among his brothers to lead the eastern expedition due to his exceptional qualities and the divine mandate passed down through his ancestry. His upbringing in Hyuga, a region associated with the descent of the heavenly grandson, reinforced his legitimacy as a ruler chosen by the gods.

The historical accuracy of these accounts remains highly contested among scholars. Modern historians generally regard Jimmu as a legendary or mythological figure rather than a historical person, with the detailed accounts in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki likely compiled centuries after the events they describe, incorporating mythology, political propaganda, and possibly fragmented historical memories of early Japanese state formation.

## Rise to Power

Emperor Jimmu's rise to power is chronicled in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki through the narrative of his Eastern Expedition (Jinmu Tosei or 神武東征), a military campaign that forms the foundation myth of the Japanese state. According to these accounts, at the age of 45, Jimmu gathered his brothers and announced his intention to move eastward to Yamato, which he believed to be the center of the land and therefore the ideal location to rule and bring peace to the realm.

The expedition, which reportedly began in 667 BCE, was a challenging military campaign that lasted several years. Jimmu sailed from Kyushu with a fleet of ships, traveling through the Seto Inland Sea and encountering both allies and enemies. The journey took him through various regions including Usa, Okada, and Takashima, where he engaged in diplomacy and warfare with local chieftains and tribes.

One of the most significant episodes in Jimmu's rise to power was his encounter with resistance in the Yamato region. The chronicles describe fierce battles against local rulers, particularly Nagasunehiko, a powerful chieftain who controlled the Yamato plain. In these accounts, Jimmu's forces initially suffered setbacks, including an ambush that resulted in the death of his brother Itsuse no Mikoto.

According to mythology, Jimmu's eventual victory was aided by divine intervention. The most famous supernatural element is the appearance of the Yatagarasu, a three-legged crow sent by the gods to guide Jimmu through the mountains to a strategic position. Additionally, the sun goddess Amaterasu is said to have sent a sacred golden kite that perched on Jimmu's bow, blinding his enemies with its radiance and allowing him to achieve victory.

After defeating Nagasunehiko and other opponents, Jimmu established his palace at Kashihara in Yamato (present-day Kashihara City, Nara Prefecture). On the first day of the first month of the lunisolar calendar in 660 BCE—corresponding to February 11 in the Gregorian calendar—Jimmu ascended to the throne and became the first Emperor of Japan, establishing what would become the world's oldest continuous hereditary monarchy.

## Major Achievements

Emperor Jimmu's primary achievement, according to traditional accounts, was the unification of various tribes and regions under a single imperial authority, thereby founding the Japanese nation-state and establishing the imperial dynasty. This accomplishment, whether historical or mythological, has had profound implications for Japanese political culture and national identity for over two millennia.

The establishment of the capital at Kashihara represented a strategic achievement that centralized political power in the Yamato region, which would remain the heartland of Japanese civilization for centuries. By choosing this location, Jimmu (or the historical figures he may represent) created a power base that allowed for more effective governance and expansion. The Yamato state that emerged from this foundation would eventually extend its influence across most of the Japanese archipelago.

According to the chronicles, Jimmu implemented policies aimed at pacifying and integrating the various tribes and clans he had defeated during his eastern expedition. Rather than simply subjugating these groups, he reportedly incorporated local leaders into his administration, a practice that would characterize Japanese statecraft for generations. This inclusive approach to governance helped establish stability and legitimacy for the new regime.

The symbolic achievement attributed to Jimmu was the establishment of the principle of imperial rule based on divine descent. By claiming lineage from the sun goddess Amaterasu, Jimmu created a religious and political ideology that positioned the emperor as a sacred figure who mediated between the divine and human realms. This concept of the emperor as a living god (arahitogami) would remain central to Japanese political theology until 1946, when Emperor Hirohito renounced his divinity following World War II.

Traditional accounts credit Jimmu with bringing civilization, agriculture, and moral order to the Japanese islands. The chronicles describe him as a benevolent ruler who promoted agricultural development, established laws, and encouraged the arts and learning. While these achievements are likely anachronistic projections of later imperial propaganda onto a legendary figure, they reflect the ideal qualities that Japanese culture associated with righteous rulership.

The imperial regalia—the sacred mirror, sword, and jewel that symbolize the emperor's authority—are traditionally associated with Jimmu's reign. These objects, said to have been passed down from the goddess Amaterasu, serve as physical manifestations of imperial legitimacy and have been transmitted through every emperor from Jimmu to the present day, creating a powerful symbol of continuity.

Jimmu's military campaigns, as described in the chronicles, established the precedent for imperial expansion and the incorporation of new territories into the Japanese state. The strategies and tactics attributed to him—combining military force with diplomatic alliances, employing naval power, and seeking divine guidance—became templates for later Japanese military endeavors.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The figure of Emperor Jimmu has been the subject of intense controversy, particularly regarding his historical existence and the political uses to which his legend has been put. The overwhelming consensus among modern historians and archaeologists is that Jimmu is a legendary or mythological figure rather than a historical person. Archaeological evidence does not support the existence of a unified Japanese state in 660 BCE, and the detailed narratives in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki were compiled nearly 1,400 years after Jimmu's supposed reign, making them unreliable as historical sources.

The traditional chronology associated with Jimmu has been widely criticized as implausible. The dates given in the ancient chronicles would make him 127 years old at his death, and the early emperors in the imperial line are credited with similarly impossible lifespans. Scholars believe these dates were artificially extended backwards to make the Japanese imperial line appear more ancient and to align with Chinese chronological systems, particularly to claim that Japan's founding predated that of China.

The most controversial aspect of the Jimmu narrative concerns its use in modern Japanese nationalism and imperialism. During the Meiji period (1868-1912), the government elevated Emperor Jimmu to unprecedented prominence as part of the construction of State Shinto and the emperor-centered nationalism that supported Japan's modernization and imperial expansion. February 11, the traditional date of Jimmu's accession, was designated as National Foundation Day (Kigensetsu) in 1873.

During the ultranationalist period from the 1930s through World War II, the Jimmu myth was weaponized for militaristic purposes. The year 1940 was celebrated as the 2,600th anniversary of Jimmu's accession, with massive propaganda campaigns promoting the myth of an unbroken imperial line and Japan's divine mission to rule Asia. The concept of "Hakko Ichiu" (八紘一宇, "eight corners of the world under one roof"), allegedly derived from Jimmu's proclamation, was used to justify Japanese imperial expansion and conquest.

The archaeological site at Kashihara, designated as Jimmu's tomb, has been criticized as a politically constructed monument rather than an authentic historical site. The Imperial Household Agency maintains exclusive control over imperial tombs and generally prohibits independent archaeological investigation, preventing scholars from verifying or refuting traditional claims about early emperors including Jimmu.

Some critics argue that the Jimmu narrative represents a conquest myth that legitimizes the subjugation of indigenous peoples, particularly the Emishi in northern Japan and the Ryukyuan peoples. The story of Jimmu's eastern expedition can be read as a mythologized account of the Yamato state's expansion and the violent incorporation of diverse peoples and cultures into a centralized regime.

Feminist scholars have noted that the Jimmu myth, like much of early Japanese mythology, privileges male lineage and military conquest while marginalizing female power and alternative forms of authority. Despite the importance of the sun goddess Amaterasu in the imperial mythology, the narrative of state formation focuses almost exclusively on male military leaders.

The continued official recognition of Jimmu in post-war Japan remains controversial. While the holiday was briefly abolished after World War II, it was reinstated in 1966 as National Foundation Day (Kenkoku Kinen no Hi), though with less emphasis on the imperial mythology. Critics argue that this perpetuates nationalist myths that should be relegated to the realm of cultural heritage rather than state commemoration.

## Personal Life

The personal life of Emperor Jimmu, as recounted in the ancient chronicles, blends mythological elements with narrative conventions typical of legendary heroes. According to the Nihon Shoki, Jimmu married Ahira-tsu-hime, also known as Himetatara-isuzu-hime, who became his empress. She was the daughter of a local deity or chieftain named Mishima no Mizokui no Kami, and their union is described as politically significant, cementing alliances with local powers in the Yamato region.

The chronicles record that Jimmu and his empress had several children, most importantly Kamu-nunakawa-mimi no Mikoto, who would succeed him as Emperor Suizei. Traditional accounts describe Jimmu as a devoted father concerned with establishing a stable succession, a theme that would become central to imperial politics throughout Japanese history. His decision to designate a clear heir and establish primogeniture principles set precedents for the imperial succession system.

Jimmu's personality, as portrayed in the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, combines martial prowess with wisdom and piety. He is depicted as a decisive military leader capable of bold strategic decisions, such as the audacious plan to relocate his power base from Kyushu to Yamato. At the same time, he is shown as deeply religious, constantly seeking guidance from the gods through divination and ritual, and attributing his victories to divine will rather than personal glory.

The chronicles describe several instances of Jimmu demonstrating mercy toward defeated enemies, choosing to integrate them into his administration rather than execute them. This portrayal suggests an ideal of rulership that balanced strength with benevolence, a concept central to Confucian political philosophy that was likely projected onto the Jimmu legend during the compilation of the chronicles.

According to tradition, Jimmu lived to the age of 127 years, reigning for 76 years before his death in 585 BCE. While this longevity is clearly mythological, it reflects the ancient Japanese concept that virtuous rulers blessed by the gods enjoyed extraordinarily long lives. His death is recorded as peaceful, and he was reportedly buried at Unebi Yama no e no Misasagi in Kashihara, though the actual tomb site was "rediscovered" and designated only in the 19th century during the Meiji period.

The personal attributes assigned to Jimmu in later artistic and literary representations emphasize his role as a cultural hero and national founder. He is typically depicted as dignified, resolute, and divinely favored, embodying the ideal qualities of Japanese leadership. These representations, however, tell us more about the values and political needs of the periods in which they were created than about any historical individual.

## Legacy

Emperor Jimmu's legacy extends far beyond questions of his historical existence, profoundly shaping Japanese national identity, political ideology, and cultural consciousness for over two millennia. As the legendary founder of the imperial dynasty, Jimmu serves as the symbolic origin point for Japanese sovereignty and statehood, establishing the principle of an unbroken imperial lineage that continues to the present day with Emperor Naruhito, the 126th emperor according to traditional counting.

The most enduring aspect of Jimmu's legacy is the establishment of the imperial institution itself as the central organizing principle of Japanese political life. Even during periods when emperors exercised little actual power—such as during the shogunates that ruled Japan from the 12th to 19th centuries—the imperial line traced back to Jimmu remained the source of political legitimacy. This continuity, real or constructed, distinguishes Japan from other nations where dynasties rose and fell throughout history.

The Jimmu myth provided the foundation for the concept of kokutai (国体), or national polity, which became central to Japanese political discourse, especially during the Meiji period and the years leading to World War II. Kokutai defined Japan as a unique nation with a divine emperor as its eternal center, fundamentally different from other countries. This ideology, rooted in the Jimmu narrative, had profound consequences for Japan's modern history, contributing to both the country's rapid modernization and its military expansionism.

Jimmu's eastern expedition has served as a mythological template for Japanese territorial expansion and nation-building. The narrative of a divinely sanctioned mission to bring civilization and order to disparate regions has been invoked at various points in Japanese history to justify expansion, from the incorporation of northern territories to the imperial conquests of the early 20th century. This aspect of Jimmu's legacy remains deeply problematic given its association with Japanese militarism.

In terms of cultural legacy, Emperor Jimmu occupies a central place in Japanese art, literature, and education. His story has been retold in countless forms, from classical literature to modern manga and anime. Kashihara Shrine, built in 1890 at the supposed site of his palace, has become a major site of pilgrimage and national celebration, particularly on National Foundation Day (February 11), attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.

The Jimmu narrative has influenced Japanese archaeological and historical scholarship, sometimes in problematic ways. The desire to validate the ancient chronicles has occasionally led to politically motivated archaeological interpretations, while the Imperial Household Agency's restrictions on examining imperial tombs have hindered objective historical research. However, the critical scholarly examination of the Jimmu myth has also contributed to the development of sophisticated methodologies for analyzing mythology, legend, and the construction of national narratives.

In post-war Japan, Jimmu's legacy has become more complex and contested. While the emperor system was preserved after World War II, the mythological basis of imperial authority was officially renounced when Emperor Hirohito declared his humanity in 1946. This created a tension between the traditional Jimmu-based legitimacy of the imperial house and the new constitutional role of the emperor as a symbol of the state and national unity. Contemporary Japan continues to negotiate this tension, with Jimmu serving simultaneously as a cultural symbol and a reminder of the dangerous potentials of mythologized nationalism.

Internationally, the Jimmu legend has shaped perceptions of Japan as a nation with an exceptionally long and continuous history. The claim of an imperial line dating back 2,600+ years, while historically questionable, has become part of Japan's national brand, distinguishing it from other nations and contributing to a sense of Japanese exceptionalism. This has both positive aspects, in terms of cultural pride and historical consciousness, and negative aspects, in terms of nationalistic exclusivity.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters of the Jimmu tradition argue that even if he was not a historical individual, the legend preserves important cultural truths about Japanese state formation and identity. Scholars such as Umehara Takeshi have suggested that mythological narratives like that of Emperor Jimmu encode genuine historical memories of the unification of early Japanese tribes and the establishment of the Yamato state, albeit in symbolic and mythologized form. From this perspective, dismissing Jimmu entirely as fiction misses the deeper historical processes that the legend represents.

Cultural historians emphasize Jimmu's role in creating a shared national narrative that has provided cohesion and continuity to Japanese society across vast periods of time. The imperial institution, with Jimmu as its founder, has served as a unifying symbol during periods of fragmentation and conflict, providing a sense of enduring national identity even when political power was exercised by others. This continuity, they argue, has been a source of stability and cultural preservation unique in world history.

Some scholars appreciate the Jimmu narrative as a remarkable achievement of mythological synthesis, combining indigenous Japanese beliefs with influences from Chinese historical writing and Confucian political philosophy. The Kojiki and Nihon Shoki, in which the Jimmu story appears, represent sophisticated literary and ideological works that established frameworks for understanding Japanese history, religion, and politics that remained influential for over a millennium. The creation of such a comprehensive foundational myth demonstrates considerable intellectual and cultural achievement.

Defenders of Jimmu's cultural significance point out that many nations have foundational myths—Romulus and Remus for Rome, the Trojan ancestry of various European royal houses, the biblical narratives underlying Western civilization—and that these myths serve important functions in creating collective identity and values regardless of their historical accuracy. From this perspective, criticizing Japan for maintaining the Jimmu tradition applies an unfair standard not applied to similar myths in other cultures.

Conservative Japanese scholars and traditionalists argue that the imperial institution and the continuity it represents, symbolized by Jimmu, has been a moderating force in Japanese history, providing legitimacy and stability that prevented the worst excesses of civil war and dictatorship. They point out that even during military rule under the shoguns, the existence of the emperor as the ultimate source of authority placed moral and theoretical limits on the exercise of power.

Contemporary Shinto practitioners and those interested in Japanese spiritual traditions view Jimmu not primarily as a historical figure but as an important kami (deity or spirit) who embodies the sacred origins of Japan and the connection between the divine and human realms. From this religious perspective, the question of historical existence is less relevant than the spiritual truths and practices that the Jimmu tradition supports.

Some comparative historians have noted that the principle of constitutional monarchy that exists in modern Japan, with the emperor as a symbol of national unity without political power, represents a successful adaptation of the imperial tradition to democratic governance. The mythological foundation provided by Jimmu and the ancient chronicles, they argue, has proven flexible enough to evolve while maintaining continuity, supporting rather than undermining Japan's postwar democratic development.

### Negative Views

The majority of academic historians regard Emperor Jimmu as a legendary or entirely mythological figure with no basis in historical reality. Archaeological evidence demonstrates that the kind of unified state described in the Jimmu narrative did not exist in Japan in 660 BCE or for several centuries thereafter. The Yayoi period (300 BCE - 300 CE), during which rice agriculture and metallurgy spread throughout Japan, shows no evidence of centralized imperial rule, and the earliest historical Japanese state probably emerged only in the 5th or 6th century CE, roughly a millennium after Jimmu's supposed reign.

Critical scholars such as Tsuda Sokichi (1873-1961) demonstrated through rigorous textual analysis that the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki are unreliable as historical sources for ancient Japan, having been compiled with political and ideological purposes to legitimize the ruling dynasty and establish Japan's equivalence with China in terms of historical antiquity. Tsuda's work, which was suppressed during the ultranationalist period for "disrespecting the imperial institution," has been vindicated by subsequent archaeological and historical research.

Many historians emphasize the dangerous political uses to which the Jimmu myth was put during Japan's militarist period (1930s-1945). The elevation of Jimmu and the ideology of kokutai contributed directly to a political climate in which rational criticism was suppressed, aggressive war was pursued as a divine mission, and millions died in the name of imperial expansion. The 1940 celebrations of the 2,600th anniversary of Jimmu's accession served as a massive propaganda exercise that intensified nationalistic fervor at a critical moment in Japan's descent into total war.

Postcolonial scholars criticize the Jimmu narrative as a conquest myth that has been used to legitimize the domination of the Yamato ethnic group over other peoples within the Japanese archipelago, including the Ainu, Ryukyuans, and other indigenous groups. The eastern expedition story, they argue, mythologizes violent conquest and cultural erasure, transforming subjugation into a divine mission. This critique is particularly relevant given ongoing issues of discrimination against ethnic minorities in Japan and debates over the rights of indigenous peoples.

Feminist historians point out that the Jimmu myth, while acknowledging female divine ancestry through Amaterasu, ultimately establishes a patriarchal system of male military conquest and male-line succession. The narrative privileges martial masculinity and has contributed to the exclusion of women from the imperial succession, a controversy that continues in contemporary Japan where some advocate for allowing female emperors while traditionalists insist on male-only succession based on precedents supposedly established by Jimmu.

Scientific historians argue that the continued official recognition of Jimmu through National Foundation Day and the maintenance of his supposed tomb by the Imperial Household Agency represents a troubling persistence of myth in the realm of historical fact. The prohibition on independent archaeological investigation of imperial tombs prevents scientific verification or refutation of traditional claims and privileges political and religious considerations over historical knowledge. This, critics argue, reflects a broader Japanese reluctance to fully confront the mythological basis of national identity.

Some scholars view the Jimmu legend as fundamentally anti-democratic, establishing the principle of hereditary authority based on divine descent rather than popular sovereignty or meritocracy. While Japan has successfully adapted the imperial institution to constitutional democracy, the ideological foundation of the system remains rooted in principles that are fundamentally at odds with modern democratic values. This tension, critics argue, has never been fully resolved and continues to manifest in debates over constitutional revision and the role of the emperor.

International observers, particularly from countries that experienced Japanese imperialism, often view the Jimmu myth and its continued official status with suspicion, seeing it as part of an incomplete reckoning with Japan's militarist past. The fact that February 11 remains a national holiday celebrating a mythological emperor whose legend was weaponized for imperial conquest is, from this perspective, analogous to continuing to celebrate ideological symbols associated with aggressive nationalism.

## Famous Quotes

> "It is here that our empire should be established, for this is undoubtedly the center of the world. Let us make this our capital."

*Attributed to Jimmu upon first viewing the Yamato plain. This quote, recorded in the Nihon Shoki, reflects the geopolitical reasoning for establishing the imperial capital in central Japan and the concept of Japan as the center of civilization. This statement has been invoked throughout Japanese history to justify the centrality of Yamato/Nara region in Japanese culture and politics.*

> "I have heard that in the East there is a beautiful land encircled by blue mountains. I think that this land will undoubtedly be suitable for the extension of our heavenly task, so that its glory should fill the universe. It is doubtless the center of the world."

*From the Nihon Shoki, this declaration represents Jimmu's justification for the Eastern Expedition. The phrase "extension of our heavenly task" (天業, tengyo) became central to Japanese imperial ideology, suggesting that the emperor's rule was a divine mission. This quote was frequently invoked during the Meiji period to justify Japanese expansion and modernization.*

> "Though the imperial throne is firm as the eternal heaven and earth, yet the people are our treasure. Let us love them and protect them always."

*This benevolent statement, attributed to Jimmu in later Confucian-influenced texts, reflects the ideal of the emperor as a caring parent to his subjects. While likely not historical, it represents an important principle in Japanese political philosophy that rulers should govern for the benefit of the people rather than for personal gain.*

> "I will extend the line of my imperial ancestors and make my dwelling in this land. May my descendants for a myriad generations preserve it in peace."

*Recorded in the Kojiki, this proclamation emphasizes the continuity of the imperial line and the sacred duty to preserve the throne for future generations. This concept of eternal imperial succession has been fundamental to Japanese political culture and remains relevant in contemporary debates about imperial succession.*

> "The sacred crow sent by the sun goddess has guided us through the mountains. With the blessings of heaven, we cannot fail."

*This quote, referencing the mythological three-legged crow (Yatagarasu) that guided Jimmu to victory, illustrates the intimate connection between imperial authority and divine will. The Yatagarasu has become an enduring symbol in Japanese culture, even appearing as the emblem of the Japan Football Association, demonstrating the continuing cultural influence of Jimmu mythology.*
