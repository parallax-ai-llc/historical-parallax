## Summary

Zhu De (December 1, 1886 – July 6, 1976) was one of China's greatest military leaders and the founder of the Chinese communist army that would become the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Born into poverty in Sichuan province, he rose from humble origins to become Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army and later the PLA, playing a crucial role in the Long March, the war against Japan, and the Chinese Civil War. Alongside Mao Zedong, he developed revolutionary guerrilla warfare tactics that transformed modern military strategy and led the Communist Party of China to ultimate victory in 1949. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, he was ranked first among the ten marshals in 1955 and served as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress from 1959 until his death in 1976.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Zhu De was born on December 1, 1886, in Yilong County, Sichuan province, to a desperately poor tenant farmer's family. Three generations lived in the household, including his grandparents, their four sons with their wives and children. He was the fourth of what would be thirteen children, though only the first eight survived infancy. According to Zhu's own later accounts, his father was "cruel" and drowned at least five of his siblings at birth because the family could not afford to feed more mouths—a grim reflection of the desperate poverty that characterized rural China in the late Qing dynasty.[^4][^5]

Despite this abject poverty, the family pooled their meager resources to send young Zhu to a regional private school in 1892, recognizing his potential. This decision proved transformative. At age nine, he was adopted by his prosperous uncle, whose wealth and political influence opened doors that would otherwise have remained closed to a child of his background. This adoption enabled Zhu to receive a superior education that eventually led to his admission into a military academy, fundamentally altering the trajectory of his life.[^6][^7]

Around 1907, Zhu enrolled in a Sichuan high school and graduated in 1908. He then returned to Yilong's primary school as a physical education instructor. As a teacher, he proved to be an advocate of modern science and political education rather than strict adherence to classical Chinese learning, which put him at odds with traditional authorities. His progressive views eventually led to his dismissal from the teaching post. This setback, however, propelled him toward his true calling. He subsequently entered the prestigious Yunnan Military Academy in Kunming, where he would receive the military training that would shape his future as one of China's greatest commanders.[^8][^9]

At the Yunnan Military Academy, Zhu immersed himself in military science and revolutionary politics. He joined the Beiyang Army and became a member of the Tongmenghui, the secret political society led by Sun Yat-sen that was the forerunner of the Kuomintang (KMT). This membership placed him at the heart of the revolutionary movement that sought to overthrow the Qing dynasty and establish a modern Chinese republic. In July 1911, Zhu graduated from the Yunnan Military Academy and briefly taught at the academy before the revolution erupted that would end over two thousand years of imperial rule in China.[^10][^11]

---

## Rise to Power

In 1911, immediately after his graduation, Zhu De participated in the revolution that successfully overthrew the Qing dynasty, marking his first direct involvement in the transformation of China. For the next decade, from 1911 to 1921, he served as a middle-ranking officer and eventually rose to brigade commander in the armies of various warlords in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in southwestern China. During this period, he gained extensive military experience and witnessed firsthand the chaos and corruption of warlord politics that plagued republican China.[^12][^13]

By 1922, deeply disillusioned with warlordism and the chaotic politics of republican China in general, Zhu made a momentous decision that would change his life and, ultimately, Chinese history. He traveled to Europe to study, attending universities in Berlin and Göttingen, Germany. While in Germany, he encountered Marxist theory and was profoundly influenced by the intellectual ferment of post-World War I Europe. In this period, he joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), committing himself to the revolutionary transformation of Chinese society according to communist principles.[^14][^15]

Zhu's rise to prominence in the Communist movement began in earnest with the Nanchang Uprising of August 1, 1927. Communist elements of the National Revolutionary Army, including Zhu De, He Long, Ye Jianying, and Zhou Enlai, rebelled against the Kuomintang after the devastating Shanghai massacre earlier that year, in which Chiang Kai-shek had turned on his communist allies and slaughtered thousands. The Nanchang Uprising, though ultimately crushed by Nationalist forces, is regarded by the CCP as marking the birth of the Chinese Red Army and is still celebrated as Army Day in the People's Republic of China.[^16][^17]

After the Nanchang Uprising was defeated, Zhu demonstrated his military acumen and leadership by successfully leading his remaining troops on a harrowing retreat south through Fujian and Guangdong provinces, eventually reaching Hunan province. There, in a meeting that would prove historic, his forces linked up with the small guerrilla army of Mao Zedong in 1928. The two commanders formed the 4th Red Army, with Zhu De as military commander and Mao Zedong as political commissar. This partnership, known as "Zhu-Mao" (some peasants even believed they were one person), would become legendary and form the foundation of the Communist military success.[^18][^19]

Together, Zhu and Mao established a Soviet base in the Jiangxi-Fujian border region and began implementing the guerrilla warfare tactics that would become their trademark. Under Zhu's command, the Red Army grew exponentially from a mere 5,000 troops in 1929 to an impressive 200,000 by 1933. He successfully commanded the Red Army's defense of the Jiangxi Soviet against the Nationalists' first four encirclement campaigns between 1931 and 1933, demonstrating tactical brilliance in the face of superior enemy numbers and firepower.[^20][^21]

---

## Major Achievements

Zhu De's most celebrated military achievement was his leadership as Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army during the legendary Long March of 1934-1935. When Chiang Kai-shek's fifth encirclement campaign finally overwhelmed the Jiangxi Soviet, the Communists were forced to abandon their base and embark on a strategic retreat that would cover approximately 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) across some of the most difficult terrain in China. Zhu commanded the entire Red Army throughout this epic journey, which took the remnant communist forces through eleven provinces, across eighteen mountain ranges and twenty-four rivers, fighting their way past numerous Nationalist and warlord armies.[^22][^23]

During the Long March, Zhu played a crucial role in maintaining military discipline and cohesion under the most extreme conditions imaginable. At the pivotal Zunyi Conference in January 1935, Zhu supported Mao Zedong's criticisms of the previous military leadership under Bo Gu and the Soviet advisor Otto Braun, which proved decisive in consolidating Mao's position as the paramount leader of the CCP. Although Zhu was temporarily separated from Mao's forces when Zhang Guotao, leader of the Fourth Red Army, forced him to march south in July 1935, Zhu eventually reunited with the main force in Yan'an, Shaanxi province, where the Long March concluded.[^24][^25]

Perhaps Zhu De's most significant contribution to military history was his development, alongside Mao Zedong, of guerrilla warfare as a major strategic concept. Together they elevated guerrilla warfare from a minor supplement to conventional forces into a comprehensive military doctrine that would influence revolutionary movements worldwide. Under Zhu's leadership, the Red Army developed as a highly mobile, flexible, and self-sufficient force that operated throughout the countryside, winning the support of the rural population through strict discipline, courage, and responsiveness to peasant grievances. Their guerrilla tactics emphasized mobility, surprise, fighting only when victory was assured, and retreating when confronted with superior forces.[^26][^27]

After the formation of the Second United Front between the Communists and Nationalists to resist the Japanese invasion in 1937, Zhu was appointed commander of the Eighth Route Army, the designation given to Communist forces operating in North China. He retained overall command of all Communist military operations against the Japanese from 1937 to 1945, directing guerrilla warfare operations that tied down hundreds of thousands of Japanese troops in the countryside and expanded Communist base areas throughout northern China. His leadership during the anti-Japanese war greatly enhanced the CCP's legitimacy among the Chinese population and allowed the Red Army to grow from approximately 40,000 troops in 1937 to nearly one million by 1945.[^28][^29]

Upon the Japanese surrender in 1945 and the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, Zhu commanded the renamed People's Liberation Army in its final victorious campaigns against the Nationalists. Under his overall strategic direction, the PLA defeated Chiang Kai-shek's numerically superior and better-equipped forces in a series of decisive battles between 1946 and 1949, culminating in the Communist victory and the establishment of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. The success of the PLA under Zhu's command represented one of the most remarkable military achievements of the twentieth century.[^30][^31]

After 1949, Zhu De continued to play a crucial role in building the new nation. He was named Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army and retained this position until 1954. In 1955, when the PRC established its system of military ranks, Zhu was ranked first among the ten marshals of the People's Republic of China, an honor that recognized his unparalleled contributions to the Communist military victory. From 1959 until his death in 1976, he served as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, making him one of the most senior political figures in the Chinese government. Throughout his career, Zhu held fast to the principle of "the Party commands the gun" and contributed brilliantly to the growth of the PLA and the development of its strategies and tactics.[^32][^33][^34]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his immense contributions to the Communist revolution, Zhu De faced significant political difficulties and criticisms, particularly during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution period. From 1966 onward, he was publicly criticized by members of the Politburo, yet he characteristically refused to be silenced, demonstrating the personal courage that had marked his military career. Jiang Qing, Mao's wife and one of the leaders of the Cultural Revolution, accused Zhu of wanting to take power for himself, a serious charge in the paranoid atmosphere of that period.[^35][^36]

At sessions of the Central Committee during the Cultural Revolution, Zhu's revolutionary legacy was systematically attacked and distorted. His contributions at Jinggangshan, where he and Mao had first joined forces, were reinterpreted in negative terms. He was labeled the "black commander" rather than the "red commander," implying that he had followed the wrong political line. Big-character posters were put up at his house in Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound in Beijing, publicly denouncing him. His wife, Kang Keqing, was humiliated by being forced to wear a dunce cap at criticism sessions. Zhu himself was characterized as "a big warlord and careerist who had wormed his way into the Party."[^37][^38]

Throughout these attacks, Zhu De maintained his integrity and refused to capitulate to political pressure. He notably refused to write letters in support of the Cultural Revolution and also refused to write a self-criticism for his alleged failure to support it. This principled stance, while admirable, further isolated him politically during one of the darkest periods in modern Chinese history. Many of his old comrades and subordinates suffered even worse fates, including persecution, torture, and death.[^39]

Zhu's relationship with Mao Zedong, initially one of the most successful military-political partnerships in history, deteriorated significantly in later years. While Mao initially praised Zhu, he later systematically diminished Zhu's historical role. Mao ensured that a biography Zhu had commissioned detailing his revolutionary deeds was never published. According to historian Dick Wilson, this suppression occurred because the biography "might have suggested that not every single victory on the Long March and at other moments of the Communist struggle was due to the genius of the Chairman." This erasure of Zhu from the historical narrative represented Mao's determination to establish himself as the sole architect of Communist victory.[^40][^41]

A critical turning point in Zhu's political fortunes came after the 1959 Lushan Conference, when he attempted to protect Marshal Peng Dehuai, who had criticized Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward policies. Zhu offered some mild criticisms of Peng rather than fully denouncing him, which was interpreted as insufficient loyalty to Mao. As a consequence, Mao dismissed Zhu from his position as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, significantly reducing his political influence. This incident demonstrated the dangerous political environment in which even the most senior revolutionary veterans could fall from grace for perceived disloyalty.[^42][^43]

An additional controversy in evaluating Zhu De's career concerns the military campaigns and violence associated with the Communist revolution and consolidation of power. Like other Communist leaders, Zhu was involved in military operations that resulted in massive casualties, the destruction of the landlord class, and the implementation of policies that led to widespread suffering. While supporters emphasize the revolutionary necessity of these actions in the context of overthrowing an oppressive old order, critics point to the human cost and the authoritarian system that ultimately emerged.[^44]

## Personal Life

Zhu De's personal life was marked by tragedy, complexity, and multiple marriages that reflected the tumultuous revolutionary period in which he lived. He married four times, according to the unfinished biography written by American journalist Agnes Smedley, who knew Zhu personally and documented his life story. His known relationships reveal a man who experienced profound personal loss while dedicating himself to revolutionary struggle.[^45][^46]

His first marriage was to Xiao Jufang, a fellow student at the Kunming Normal Institute. The pair married in 1912, when Zhu was embarking on his military career. Their marriage produced Zhu's only son, Baozhu, but ended tragically in 1916 when Xiao died of a fever shortly after giving birth. This devastating loss occurred while Zhu was still a young officer serving in the warlord armies of southwestern China, leaving him with an infant son to care for.[^47][^48]

After Xiao Jufang's death, Zhu was advised by friends to find a mother for his infant son. He was introduced to Chen Yuzhen by friends in the military, and the two married in 1916. Chen proved to be an intellectually engaged partner who supported Zhu's growing political interests. She looked after their home and even built a study for Zhu and his scholarly friends to meet, which she furnished with pamphlets, books, and manifestos on the Russian October Revolution. This detail suggests that Chen played a role in Zhu's political education and his growing attraction to revolutionary ideas, though the ultimate fate of this marriage is not well documented in the available sources.[^49][^50]

In late 1922, when Zhu went to Berlin to study, he was accompanied by his partner He Zhihua. While there is no clear evidence that they formally married, their relationship was significant. While in Moscow, He Zhihua gave birth to Zhu's only daughter, Zhu Min. The circumstances of this relationship and its conclusion remain somewhat unclear in the historical record, reflecting the general paucity of information about the personal lives of revolutionary figures from this period.[^51][^52]

Zhu's final and most enduring marriage was to Kang Keqing, whom he married in 1929. Kang was herself a revolutionary who had joined the Communist movement as a young woman and participated in the Long March. She remained Zhu's wife until his death in 1976, a partnership that spanned nearly five decades and the entirety of the Communist revolutionary struggle and the establishment of the People's Republic. During the Cultural Revolution, she shared in her husband's persecution, being forced to wear a dunce cap at public criticism sessions, demonstrating the vulnerability of even the most senior revolutionary families during that period.[^53]

Those who knew Zhu De personally often remarked on his compassion for ordinary people and his unpretentious manner, which stood in contrast to some other senior Communist leaders. Despite rising to the highest ranks of political and military power, he never forgot his origins as the son of poor peasants. This connection to the common people was seen as one of his greatest strengths as a military commander, enabling him to maintain the loyalty and affection of ordinary soldiers throughout his career. He was known for his ability to endure the same hardships as his troops and for his concern for their welfare, qualities that made him beloved among the rank-and-file of the Red Army.[^54][^55]

## Legacy

Zhu De's legacy as one of the principal founders of the People's Liberation Army remains secure in Chinese military history and the official narrative of the People's Republic of China. He is widely acclaimed as the founder of the Red Army and, due to his appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army after 1949, is regarded as a principal architect of the PLA that continues to serve as the military force of the PRC today. His contributions to building a revolutionary army from a ragtag collection of guerrilla forces into a formidable military organization capable of defeating both the Japanese and the Nationalists represent an extraordinary achievement.[^56][^57]

The military tactics and strategic principles that Zhu De developed alongside Mao Zedong have had an enduring impact far beyond China. Their elevation of guerrilla warfare from a minor supplement to conventional forces into a major strategic concept influenced revolutionary movements throughout the developing world during the Cold War period. From Vietnam to Latin America to Africa, revolutionary leaders studied and adapted the guerrilla warfare doctrines that Zhu and Mao pioneered in the mountains and countryside of China. The concept of a people's army, integrated with the population and fighting for their interests, became a model for insurgent movements globally.[^58][^59]

Zhu's military philosophy emphasized the importance of maintaining a peasant-based conscript army rather than a professional military elite. Throughout his career, he advocated against the professionalization and separation of the military from the masses, insisting that the PLA should remain a people's army in fact as well as name. He maintained a strong commitment to the principle that "the Party commands the gun," ensuring civilian Communist Party control over the military and preventing the emergence of an independent military power base. This principle has remained a cornerstone of the PRC's civil-military relations to the present day.[^60][^61]

Within China, Zhu De is remembered as a revolutionary hero and a symbol of the CCP's commitment to the liberation of the Chinese people from foreign imperialism and domestic oppression. His rise from extreme poverty to the highest ranks of military command embodies the narrative of revolutionary transformation that the CCP promotes. Monuments, museums, and historical sites associated with Zhu De's life and military campaigns serve as pilgrimage sites for patriotic education in contemporary China. His former residence and the sites of his major battles have been preserved as reminders of the revolutionary heritage of the People's Republic.[^62][^63]

However, Zhu's legacy is complicated by the political struggles he endured in his later years and by Mao's efforts to minimize his historical role. The "Zhu-Mao" partnership that was so central to the early success of the Red Army was increasingly rewritten in official histories to emphasize Mao's singular genius while diminishing Zhu's contributions. This historical revisionism has created a tension in how Zhu De is remembered: officially honored as one of the great founders of the PLA and the PRC, yet historically overshadowed by Mao's larger-than-life personality cult.[^64][^65]

In scholarly assessments outside China, Zhu De is generally recognized as an exceptionally skilled military commander and organizer who played an indispensable role in the Communist victory. His tactical acumen, his ability to build military cohesion and morale, and his contributions to guerrilla warfare doctrine are widely acknowledged. At the same time, Western historians note that like all Communist leaders of his era, he was complicit in military operations and political campaigns that resulted in immense human suffering and the establishment of an authoritarian state.[^66][^67]

Zhu De's dedication to the revolutionary movement and his compassion for the struggles of ordinary Chinese citizens are themes that emerge consistently in biographical accounts. Unlike some revolutionary leaders who became increasingly divorced from the common people as they rose to power, Zhu maintained connections to his humble origins and demonstrated genuine concern for the welfare of soldiers and peasants. This quality helped sustain his legitimacy and popularity even during periods of political difficulty, and it remains a central element of how he is remembered today.[^68]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians who take a positive view of Zhu De emphasize his extraordinary military talents and his crucial role in the survival and ultimate victory of the Chinese Communist Party. Military historians in particular praise his tactical brilliance during the defense of the Jiangxi Soviet, where he successfully repelled four major Nationalist encirclement campaigns despite facing forces that were numerically superior and better equipped. His ability to command the Red Army through the grueling Long March, maintaining cohesion and fighting capability despite catastrophic losses, is seen as a testament to his leadership abilities and his soldiers' loyalty to him.[^69][^70]

Defenders of Zhu De's legacy point to his contributions to military science, particularly the development of guerrilla warfare doctrine that revolutionized how wars of national liberation could be fought. Together with Mao Zedong, he demonstrated that a poorly equipped peasant army could defeat a modern military force through superior tactics, mobility, political work among the population, and the establishment of secure base areas. This strategic innovation influenced military thinking globally and provided a blueprint for successful insurgent campaigns in numerous countries during the mid-twentieth century.[^71][^72]

Chinese historians and official accounts emphasize Zhu's unwavering commitment to the Communist Party and his adherence to the principle of Party control over the military. Throughout his career, even when he held supreme military command, he never attempted to use the army as a personal power base or to challenge the Party's civilian leadership. This principled stance is credited with establishing the civil-military relationship that has characterized the People's Republic and prevented the military coups that have plagued many other revolutionary regimes.[^73]

Biographers note Zhu De's personal qualities of humility, compassion, and connection to ordinary people as distinguishing features that made him an exceptional leader. Agnes Smedley, the American journalist who knew him well, portrayed him as a man of genuine sympathy for the oppressed and downtrodden, whose revolutionary commitment stemmed from authentic outrage at the injustices he had witnessed in Chinese society. His ability to endure the same hardships as his troops and his concern for their welfare created extraordinary loyalty among the rank-and-file soldiers who served under him.[^74][^75]

Supporters also emphasize that Zhu De demonstrated personal courage and integrity during the Cultural Revolution by refusing to write self-criticisms or support campaigns he disagreed with, even when doing so placed him at considerable personal risk. His willingness to protect colleagues like Peng Dehuai, despite the political costs, is seen as evidence of his moral character and his resistance to the worst excesses of Maoist radicalism. That he survived the Cultural Revolution with his dignity intact, when so many others were destroyed, speaks to his political skill as well as his principled stubbornness.[^76]

### Negative Views

Critics of Zhu De emphasize that, regardless of his military talents, he was a key architect of a Communist revolution that imposed a totalitarian political system on China and resulted in immense human suffering. The military campaigns he commanded were characterized by violence not only against enemy combatants but also against landlords, local elites, and others deemed class enemies. The establishment of Soviet base areas under his military protection involved harsh class struggle campaigns, summary executions, and the destruction of traditional social structures. While defenders argue these actions were necessary in the context of revolutionary warfare, critics point to the human cost and the authoritarian outcomes.[^77][^78]

Some Western historians argue that Zhu De's military reputation has been overstated, suggesting that the Communist victory owed more to Nationalist incompetence, war-weariness among the Chinese population after decades of conflict, and Soviet support than to any particular military genius on the part of Communist commanders. They note that the Red Army suffered catastrophic defeats as well as victories, and that the Long March, while celebrated as a triumph of endurance, was fundamentally a strategic retreat forced by military defeat. The romanticization of guerrilla warfare, they argue, obscures the fact that final victory came through conventional military operations once the PLA had built up sufficient strength.[^79][^80]

Critics also point to Zhu De's complicity in the political campaigns and policies of the Communist Party, including land reform programs that resulted in the execution of millions of landlords and "rich peasants," the suppression of political dissent, and the establishment of a one-party state that denied basic freedoms to the Chinese people. While Zhu may not have been directly responsible for formulating these policies, as the senior military commander he was responsible for implementing them and ensuring military support for the Party's political line. His military success made the establishment of Communist dictatorship possible.[^81]

Some scholars criticize Zhu De's political timidity and his failure to use his immense prestige to challenge Mao's disastrous policies, particularly the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. While he showed some courage in attempting to protect Peng Dehuai in 1959, he ultimately acquiesced to Mao's leadership even when it was leading China toward catastrophe. Critics argue that senior leaders like Zhu who understood the reality of conditions in China bore a responsibility to speak out more forcefully against policies they knew were causing mass starvation and suffering. His survival through the Cultural Revolution, in this view, suggests he was too willing to compromise his principles to preserve his position.[^82][^83]

Anti-communist historians emphasize that Zhu De's military career was fundamentally dedicated to imposing an alien ideology on China through force of arms. They argue that the Communist revolution did not represent the genuine will of the Chinese people but rather the triumph of a disciplined and ruthless minority willing to use violence systematically to seize power. From this perspective, Zhu's military skills were employed in service of an illegitimate cause, and his legacy should be evaluated in light of the oppressive system he helped create rather than celebrated as heroic.[^84]

Finally, some critics note that despite Zhu De's rhetoric about serving the people and maintaining a people's army, he was part of a revolutionary elite that enjoyed considerable privileges while ordinary Chinese people suffered through failed economic experiments, political campaigns, and chronic poverty. The gap between Communist ideals and the reality of a hierarchical, authoritarian system was never adequately addressed by Zhu or other senior leaders. His comfortable position in the revolutionary hierarchy contrasted sharply with the hardships endured by ordinary Chinese citizens, suggesting a degree of hypocrisy in the Communist leadership's claims to represent the masses.[^85]
