## Summary

Paul Broca discovered the brain's speech production center, now known as Broca's area, by studying patients who lost the ability to speak after brain lesions. His 1861 case study of patient 'Tan' established the principle of cerebral localization of function. He also founded the Anthropological Society of Paris and advanced physical anthropology.
