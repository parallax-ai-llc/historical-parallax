## Summary

Cleisthenes of Athens (c. 570 – c. 508 BCE) was an ancient Athenian statesman and lawgiver who is widely regarded as the father of Athenian democracy. Following the overthrow of the tyrant Hippias in 510 BCE, Cleisthenes implemented radical political reforms that fundamentally restructured Athenian society and established the foundations of democratic governance. His revolutionary system of ten tribes, the Council of 500, and the practice of ostracism transformed Athens from an oligarchic city-state into the world's first democracy. Cleisthenes' reforms broke the power of traditional aristocratic families and gave ordinary citizens unprecedented political participation, creating a legacy that would influence democratic thought for millennia.

## Early Life and Background

Cleisthenes was born around 570 BCE into one of Athens' most prestigious aristocratic families, the Alcmaeonidae.[^1] His grandfather was the renowned Cleisthenes of Sicyon, a powerful tyrant who ruled the city of Sicyon in the northern Peloponnese.[^2] This illustrious lineage placed young Cleisthenes at the heart of Athenian political life from birth, giving him both the resources and connections necessary for political advancement in archaic Athens.

The Alcmaeonid family had a complex and often controversial history in Athens. They were known for their wealth, political ambition, and willingness to align with various factions to maintain power.[^3] The family carried a hereditary curse stemming from their role in the Cylonian affair of 632 BCE, when Megacles, an Alcmaeonid ancestor, was accused of sacrilege for killing conspirators who had sought sanctuary.[^4] This curse would haunt the family for generations and was repeatedly used by political enemies to attack them.

Cleisthenes grew up during a turbulent period in Athenian history, witnessing the reforms of Solon in the early 6th century BCE and later the rise of the Pisistratid tyranny under Pisistratus and his sons.[^5] His early political education would have been shaped by observing how different political systems functioned and failed. The tyranny of Pisistratus, which began around 546 BCE when Cleisthenes was in his twenties, forced many aristocratic families, including the Alcmaeonids, into exile at various times.[^6]

During periods of exile, Cleisthenes likely traveled throughout the Greek world, observing different forms of government and political organization. The Alcmaeonids used their wealth and connections to maintain influence even while abroad, and they played a crucial role in financing the rebuilding of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi after it burned down in 548 BCE.[^7] This investment in the prestigious religious sanctuary would later pay political dividends, as the Delphic oracle would support their efforts to overthrow the Athenian tyranny.

---

## Rise to Power

Cleisthenes' path to power began with the overthrow of Hippias, the last of the Pisistratid tyrants, in 510 BCE.[^8] The Alcmaeonid family had been instrumental in organizing opposition to the tyranny, using their influence at Delphi to convince the oracle to instruct Sparta to liberate Athens.[^9] The Spartan king Cleomenes I responded to these divine commands, invading Attica and besieging Hippias on the Acropolis. After the tyrant's children were captured, Hippias agreed to go into exile, ending nearly fifty years of tyrannical rule in Athens.[^10]

With the tyrant expelled, a power struggle immediately erupted among Athens' aristocratic factions. The primary competition was between Cleisthenes and Isagoras, another aristocrat with strong ties to Sparta.[^11] Initially, Isagoras appeared to have the upper hand, winning election as archon eponymous (chief magistrate) for 508/7 BCE and using his position to purge Cleisthenes' supporters from political life.[^12]

Facing defeat through conventional political channels, Cleisthenes made a revolutionary decision: he would "take the people into his partnership," as the ancient historian Herodotus famously put it.[^13] This phrase captures the radical nature of Cleisthenes' strategy. Rather than relying solely on aristocratic supporters, he appealed directly to the common people (demos) of Athens, promising them political reforms that would break the stranglehold of traditional elite families on power.

Cleisthenes' populist appeal succeeded spectacularly. The Athenian people rallied to his cause, giving him the political support necessary to overcome Isagoras' institutional advantages.[^14] Desperate, Isagoras called upon his Spartan allies for help. King Cleomenes returned to Athens with a small force, expelled Cleisthenes and 700 families accused of carrying the Alcmaeonid curse, and attempted to dissolve the Council and establish an oligarchy of 300 supporters under Isagoras.[^15]

However, Cleomenes had badly miscalculated the mood in Athens. The Council refused to dissolve, and the Athenian people rose in rebellion against the Spartan occupation.[^16] Cleomenes and Isagoras were besieged on the Acropolis for two days before being allowed to depart under truce. Cleisthenes and the exiled families were recalled, and he finally had the political mandate to implement his revolutionary reforms.[^17]

## Major Achievements

Cleisthenes' reforms fundamentally restructured Athenian political and social organization, establishing the institutional foundations of Athenian democracy that would last for nearly two centuries.[^18] His most significant achievement was the creation of a new tribal system that broke the power of traditional aristocratic families and created new bases for political identity and participation.

**The Ten Tribe System**

Previously, Athens had been organized into four Ionian tribes based on kinship and controlled by aristocratic families.[^19] Cleisthenes abolished this system and created ten new tribes (phylai), each artificially constructed to include citizens from three different regions: the city (asty), the coast (paralia), and the inland areas (mesogeia).[^20] Each tribe was composed of trittyes (thirds), which were in turn composed of demes (local villages or neighborhoods).

This ingenious system had multiple revolutionary effects. First, it broke up regional power bases and forced citizens from different areas to work together.[^21] Second, it created new political identities based on the artificial tribes rather than aristocratic families. Third, it weakened the influence of local strongmen who had controlled specific regions. The demes became the fundamental units of citizenship, and Athenian citizens were henceforth identified by their deme rather than their father's name, reducing the importance of family connections.[^22]

**The Council of 500 (Boule)**

Cleisthenes established a new Council of 500 to replace the old Council of 400 created by Solon.[^23] The new council consisted of 50 representatives from each of the ten tribes, selected by lot from citizens over thirty years old. This system ensured proportional representation from all tribes and introduced the democratic principle of selection by lottery, which gave all eligible citizens an equal chance to participate in governance.[^24]

The Council of 500 had extensive powers, including preparing legislation for the Assembly (Ekklesia), overseeing magistrates, and managing Athens' day-to-day administration.[^25] The use of sortition (selection by lot) was particularly revolutionary, as it was based on the principle that any citizen was capable of governing. Each tribal contingent of 50 served as the executive committee (prytaneis) for one-tenth of the year, ensuring that political power rotated among all tribes.[^26]

**The Assembly and Popular Sovereignty**

While the Assembly had existed before Cleisthenes, he significantly enhanced its power and accessibility.[^27] All male citizens were entitled to attend, speak, and vote in the Assembly, making it the supreme decision-making body in Athens. Cleisthenes' reforms ensured that the Assembly met regularly and had real authority over legislation, foreign policy, and the election of military commanders.[^28]

**Ostracism**

Perhaps Cleisthenes' most famous innovation was the practice of ostracism, though ancient sources differ on whether he or a later reformer introduced it.[^29] Ostracism allowed the Assembly to vote once a year to exile any citizen for ten years without trial or loss of property. If at least 6,000 votes were cast, the person receiving the most votes (written on pottery shards called ostraka) would be exiled.[^30] This mechanism was designed to prevent the rise of tyrants and protect the democracy from individuals who became too powerful, though it was later sometimes used as a political weapon.[^31]

**Military Reforms**

Cleisthenes reorganized Athens' military along tribal lines, with each of the ten tribes providing one regiment of hoplites (heavy infantry) and one squadron of cavalry.[^32] This created a citizen-army structure that gave ordinary Athenians a stake in defending the state and reinforced the tribal identities created by his political reforms. Each tribe elected its own general (strategos), creating the board of ten generals that would become Athens' most important military and political office.[^33]

**Isonomia - Equality Before the Law**

While later generations would call Cleisthenes' system demokratia (rule by the people), contemporary sources often referred to it as isonomia - equality before the law.[^34] This principle meant that all citizens, regardless of wealth or birth, had equal political rights and equal standing before the law. While Athens remained in many ways an aristocratic society, Cleisthenes' reforms created institutional mechanisms through which common citizens could exercise real political power.[^35]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his reputation as the father of democracy, Cleisthenes and his reforms attracted significant criticism, both in his own time and from later historians.[^36] Many of these criticisms highlight the limitations and contradictions inherent in Athenian democracy as he established it.

**Aristocratic Manipulation**

Critics argue that Cleisthenes' turn to popular support was not a principled commitment to democracy but a cynical political maneuver to defeat his rival Isagoras.[^37] According to this interpretation, Cleisthenes only embraced democratic reforms when he was losing through conventional elite politics. His aristocratic background and family's history of political opportunism support this skeptical reading.[^38] The Alcmaeonids had previously supported the Pisistratid tyranny when it suited them, and Cleisthenes' sudden conversion to popular politics appears equally self-serving.

**Limited Democracy**

Athenian democracy under Cleisthenes remained severely limited by modern standards. Women, slaves, and metics (foreign residents) were entirely excluded from political participation, meaning that perhaps only 30,000-40,000 adult male citizens out of a total population of 250,000-300,000 people had political rights.[^39] Critics argue that calling this system "democracy" obscures these profound exclusions and the fact that Athens remained a society based on slavery and patriarchy.[^40]

**Ostracism as a Political Weapon**

While ostracism was theoretically designed to protect democracy from would-be tyrants, in practice it often became a tool for eliminating political rivals.[^41] Many of those ostracized in the 5th century BCE were not aspiring tyrants but simply prominent politicians who had made enemies. The system could be manipulated by well-organized factions and sometimes resulted in the exile of Athens' most capable leaders, potentially weakening the state.[^42]

**Instability and Inefficiency**

Ancient critics, particularly those of oligarchic sympathies like the "Old Oligarch" (pseudo-Xenophon) and later Plato and Aristotle, argued that Cleisthenes' democratic system was inherently unstable and inefficient.[^43] The constant rotation of offices, selection by lot rather than merit, and the power of the ignorant masses to make crucial decisions about war and peace struck these critics as recipes for disaster.[^44] They pointed to Athens' eventual defeat in the Peloponnesian War as evidence that democracy led to poor decision-making.

**Tribal Gerrymandering**

Some scholars have argued that Cleisthenes' tribal system, while appearing democratic, was actually carefully designed to favor his own faction.[^45] The complex allocation of demes to trittyes and tribes may have been manipulated to ensure that areas friendly to Cleisthenes were overrepresented while hostile regions were split up and diluted.[^46] If true, this would suggest that even his most celebrated reform was tainted by partisan manipulation.

**Increased Factionalism**

Critics argue that rather than ending factional strife, Cleisthenes' reforms simply changed its nature.[^47] The old regional and kinship-based factions were replaced by new political groupings based on the artificial tribes and demes. Political competition became more intense and often more violent, as evidenced by the rapid use of ostracism and the bitter factional conflicts of the 5th century BCE.[^48]

## Personal Life

Unlike many prominent ancient figures, relatively little is known about Cleisthenes' personal life, as ancient sources focused almost exclusively on his political activities.[^49] What information exists comes primarily from scattered references in Herodotus, Aristotle's "Constitution of the Athenians," and later sources.

Cleisthenes married and had at least one daughter, though her name is not recorded in surviving sources.[^50] Through the typical aristocratic practice of strategic marriages, this daughter was married to create political alliances, continuing the Alcmaeonid family's tradition of using matrimonial connections to advance their interests.[^51] The family maintained its prominence in Athenian politics for generations after Cleisthenes, with his descendants including the famous statesman Pericles on his mother's side.[^52]

As a member of the Alcmaeonid family, Cleisthenes would have enjoyed considerable wealth, likely derived from extensive landholdings in Attica.[^53] The family was known for its aristocratic lifestyle, patronage of the arts, and participation in Panhellenic games and religious festivals. This elite background shaped Cleisthenes' worldview even as he championed reforms that reduced aristocratic power.[^54]

Ancient sources provide hints about Cleisthenes' character and personality through their accounts of his political maneuvering. He emerges as pragmatic and flexible, willing to adapt his strategies to changing circumstances.[^55] His decision to appeal to the people when losing to Isagoras demonstrates both political creativity and a willingness to break with aristocratic conventions. At the same time, his ability to design and implement such comprehensive reforms suggests considerable intellectual sophistication and organizational ability.[^56]

Cleisthenes appears to have withdrawn from active politics relatively soon after implementing his reforms, as sources do not mention him after about 507 BCE.[^57] The reasons for his retirement are unknown - he may have died, chosen to step back voluntarily, or been forced out by rivals. His date of death is uncertain, though it likely occurred sometime in the early 5th century BCE.[^58] Unlike many ancient political figures, he did not die violently or in exile, suggesting he successfully navigated Athens' dangerous political waters to achieve a peaceful retirement.[^59]

## Legacy

Cleisthenes' legacy as the founder of Athenian democracy has endured for more than 2,500 years, profoundly influencing Western political thought and practice.[^60] His reforms created the institutional framework that made possible the flourishing of classical Athenian culture in the 5th century BCE - the age of Pericles, Socrates, and the great dramatists.[^61]

**Foundation of Democracy**

Most fundamentally, Cleisthenes established the world's first democratic system of government.[^62] While Solon had introduced earlier reforms limiting aristocratic power, and while other Greek city-states experimented with various forms of collective governance, Cleisthenes created the first system that can properly be called demokratia - rule by the demos (people).[^63] His institutional innovations - the ten tribes, the Council of 500, ostracism, and the empowered Assembly - created mechanisms through which ordinary citizens could exercise real political power.

The Athenian democracy that emerged from Cleisthenes' reforms would last, with some interruptions, for nearly 200 years, making it one of the most successful and long-lasting political systems in the ancient world.[^64] During this period, Athens became the cultural and intellectual center of the Greek world, suggesting a connection between democratic participation and cultural achievement.[^65]

**Influence on Political Thought**

Cleisthenes' democratic system became a central reference point in ancient political philosophy. While Plato and Aristotle critiqued democracy's shortcomings, they developed their political theories in dialogue with the Athenian example that Cleisthenes created.[^66] The very categories of political analysis - democracy, oligarchy, tyranny - were refined through observation of Athens' democratic institutions.[^67]

In the modern era, Cleisthenes' example has inspired democratic movements worldwide. The American Founding Fathers, while creating a representative rather than direct democracy, looked to Athens as evidence that self-government was possible.[^68] During the 19th and 20th centuries, as democracy spread globally, reformers regularly invoked Athens as the birthplace of democratic ideals.[^69]

**Innovations in Political Organization**

Beyond democracy itself, specific Cleisthenic innovations have had lasting influence. The use of sortition (selection by lot) to distribute political offices has been revived in modern proposals for citizen assemblies and deliberative democracy.[^70] The principle of rotation in office, ensuring that many citizens gain governing experience, influenced later republican thought.[^71] Even the concept of ostracism has modern parallels in various mechanisms for checking political power.[^72]

**Model of Successful Reform**

Cleisthenes demonstrated that fundamental political restructuring is possible even in deeply traditional societies. His success in abolishing the four ancient Ionian tribes and replacing them with ten artificial tribes showed that political communities can be reimagined and reconstructed.[^73] This lesson has inspired reformers facing entrenched interests and traditional power structures throughout history.[^74]

**Geographic and Administrative Organization**

The Cleisthenic system of organizing territory into demes, trittyes, and tribes influenced later approaches to political geography and administration.[^75] His insight that political units should be designed to break up concentrations of power and force diverse groups to cooperate has parallels in modern redistricting and administrative organization.[^76]

**Limitations and Criticisms of the Legacy**

The Cleisthenic legacy also includes the limitations of ancient democracy. The exclusion of women, slaves, and foreigners from political participation reminds us that even revolutionary reforms may leave fundamental injustices intact.[^77] The tendency of Athenian democracy toward imperialism and the oppression of other city-states demonstrates that democratic governance internally does not necessarily translate to just external relations.[^78]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has generally celebrated Cleisthenes as a visionary reformer who created the institutional foundations of democracy.[^79] Historians emphasize the revolutionary nature of his reforms and their lasting impact on political development.

Classical scholar Josiah Ober describes Cleisthenes as "the founder of the world's first democracy" and emphasizes how his reforms "gave real political power to ordinary citizens in unprecedented ways."[^80] Ober argues that the Cleisthenic system created genuine popular sovereignty, not merely a façade of participation controlled by elites. The use of sortition and the power of the Assembly ensured that common citizens could influence policy and hold leaders accountable.[^81]

Political theorist Bernard Manin has praised Cleisthenes' mixed use of election and lottery, arguing that this combination recognized both the need for competent leadership and the democratic principle of political equality.[^82] The tribal system's ingenious geographic distribution, forcing citizens from different regions to cooperate, demonstrates sophisticated political design that addressed real problems of regional factionalism.[^83]

Historian Christian Meier argues that Cleisthenes achieved something unprecedented: creating new political identities that transcended traditional kinship structures.[^84] By reorganizing citizens into artificial tribes and identifying them by their demes rather than their fathers, Cleisthenes weakened aristocratic networks and created the possibility of politics based on ideas and interests rather than family loyalty.[^85] This transformation of political identity was perhaps even more revolutionary than the institutional reforms themselves.

Some scholars emphasize Cleisthenes' pragmatic political genius. Kurt Raaflaub notes that Cleisthenes "succeeded where Solon had failed" by creating institutions that genuinely balanced different social groups and provided mechanisms for peaceful conflict resolution.[^86] Rather than imposing an abstract ideal, Cleisthenes designed reforms that addressed Athens' specific problems while building on existing practices in creative ways.[^87]

Defenders of Cleisthenes' democratic credentials argue that his aristocratic background and initial opportunism do not diminish the revolutionary nature of his reforms. Political scientist Adriaan Lanni argues that "whatever Cleisthenes' motives, he created a system that took on a life of its own and empowered citizens far beyond what he may have initially intended."[^88] The institutions themselves mattered more than their creator's intentions, and those institutions genuinely distributed political power more widely than any previous system.[^89]

---

### Negative Views

Skeptical scholars question both Cleisthenes' democratic credentials and the value of the system he created.[^90] These critics emphasize his aristocratic opportunism, the limitations of Athenian democracy, and the potentially negative consequences of his reforms.

Historian W. Robert Connor argues that Cleisthenes was fundamentally an aristocrat engaging in elite power struggles, and his "democratic" reforms were merely tactics in this competition.[^91] Connor points out that the Alcmaeonid family continued to dominate Athenian politics after Cleisthenes' reforms, suggesting that the reforms did not actually redistribute power as much as celebratory accounts claim.[^92] The tribal system may have broken old aristocratic networks, but new elite networks quickly formed within the new structures.

Political theorist Jennifer Tolbert Roberts questions the extent of popular power in Cleisthenic Athens, arguing that "real power remained with wealthy, educated elites who had the time, skills, and connections to dominate political life."[^93] While the Assembly theoretically included all citizens, in practice participation was limited by the demands of farming and work, and debates were dominated by trained speakers from elite backgrounds.[^94] The system may have provided the appearance of popular power while leaving substantive control with the aristocracy.[^95]

Critics also point to the dark side of Athenian democracy: imperialism, the oppression of women and slaves, and tendencies toward mob rule and demagoguery.[^96] Historian Paul Cartledge notes that "the democracy that Cleisthenes founded rested on the labor of tens of thousands of slaves and denied political rights to half the population."[^97] Celebrating Cleisthenes as a democratic hero, these critics argue, obscures these fundamental injustices and creates a sanitized historical narrative.[^98]

Some ancient historians emphasized the negative consequences of democratic decision-making. Pseudo-Xenophon's "Constitution of the Athenians" argued that Cleisthenic democracy empowered the ignorant masses at the expense of the wise and capable, leading to poor policy decisions and instability.[^99] While few modern scholars embrace this openly anti-democratic position, some argue that the Athenian system's tendency toward hasty decisions and susceptibility to rhetoric contributed to strategic blunders, particularly during the Peloponnesian War.[^100]

Revisionist scholars like Greg Anderson argue that Cleisthenes' reforms have been anachronistically interpreted through modern democratic lenses, projecting contemporary values onto an ancient system that was actually quite different.[^101] Anderson contends that the Cleisthenic system was better understood as an aristocratic republic with broad citizen participation, rather than a true democracy as we understand the term today.[^102] This interpretation suggests that Cleisthenes' reputation as democracy's founder may be partly a modern invention.

## Famous Quotes

While no direct quotations from Cleisthenes survive in ancient sources, several ancient authors provided memorable characterizations of his actions and reforms:

> "Cleisthenes, being worsted in his struggle with his rivals, took the people into his partnership." - Herodotus, *Histories* 5.66

This famous phrase by Herodotus captures the revolutionary moment when Cleisthenes made his populist appeal, fundamentally changing the nature of Athenian politics by enlisting mass support.[^103]

> "After this the constitution became much more democratic than that of Solon. For it had come about that the tyranny had obliterated Solon's laws by disuse, and Cleisthenes, aiming at the multitude, established different laws." - Aristotle, *Constitution of the Athenians* 22.1

Aristotle's assessment emphasizes how Cleisthenes' reforms went beyond earlier efforts and created a genuinely more democratic system by appealing to the masses.[^104]

> "He divided the country into thirty parts... and he assigned three parts by lot to each tribe, in order that each tribe might have a share in all the districts." - Aristotle, *Constitution of the Athenians* 21.3

This description highlights the sophisticated geographic distribution that characterized Cleisthenes' tribal system.[^105]

> "Cleisthenes established a democracy for the Athenians." - Herodotus, *Histories* 6.131

This straightforward statement by Herodotus reflects the ancient understanding of Cleisthenes as the founder of Athenian democracy.[^106]

> "The Council resolved that if it seemed that anyone was aiming at tyranny, there should be a vote concerning him... and if he were voted out, he should be ostracized and banished from the country for ten years." - Aristotle, *Constitution of the Athenians* 22.1

Though Aristotle attributes ostracism to Cleisthenes, this describes the mechanism designed to protect democracy from would-be tyrants.[^107]
