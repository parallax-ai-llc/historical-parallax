## Summary

Jose Clemente Orozco was one of the three great Mexican muralists alongside Rivera and Siqueiros. His powerful, often anguished murals at Dartmouth College, Guadalajara, and the Hospicio Cabanas express the tragedy and heroism of the Mexican Revolution. His dark, expressionistic style is the most emotionally intense of the Mexican muralists.
