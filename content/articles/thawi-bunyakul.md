## Summary

Thawi Bunyaket (Thai: ทวี บุณยเกตุ; also spelled Thawee Bunyaget or Tawee Boonyaket) was a Thai politician who served as Prime Minister of Thailand for just 18 days in 1945, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in Thai history.[^1][^2] A Western-educated agricultural official turned revolutionary, he was one of the civilian members of the People's Party that overthrew Thailand's absolute monarchy in 1932.[^3] His brief premiership served as a transitional government between the end of World War II and the installation of Seni Pramoj, leader of the Free Thai Movement.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Thawi Bunyaket was born on November 10, 1904, during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) in what was then known as Siam.[^5] Born into a period of significant modernization in Siamese society, Thawi came of age during an era when the monarchy was sponsoring Western education for promising young Siamese to study abroad and return as modern administrators.[^6] Little is documented about his family background or early childhood, though his later educational opportunities suggest he came from a family with sufficient means and connections to access elite educational pathways.

His formative years coincided with the reign of King Vajiravudh (Rama VI), who promoted nationalist sentiments and Thai cultural identity, followed by the ascension of King Prajadhipok (Rama VII) in 1925.[^7] The Great Depression of the 1930s would have a devastating impact on Thailand, with rice prices falling by more than 60% and land prices plummeting by 90% between 1930-1932.[^8] This economic catastrophe created widespread dissatisfaction with the absolute monarchy's governance and set the stage for revolutionary change.[^9]

Thawi pursued higher education abroad, first attending King's College, University of Cambridge in England, where he received training in modern Western academic traditions.[^10] He subsequently studied at the prestigious École nationale supérieure d'Agronomie de Grignon in France, an institution founded in 1826 that specialized in agricultural science.[^11] This dual education in both British and French institutions was typical of the Siamese elite of his generation, who were expected to absorb Western knowledge while maintaining their Thai identity.[^12]

Upon completing his studies, Thawi returned to Siam and began working as a government official at the Ministry of Agriculture.[^13] The agricultural ministry was crucial to Thailand's economy, as the country's prosperity depended heavily on rice exports, which by the 1930s comprised about 30% of world trade in rice.[^14] Working in this capacity gave Thawi firsthand experience with the challenges facing rural Thailand and the government's conservative approach to development, which was characterized by minimal infrastructure investment and reluctance to expand modern services.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Thawi Bunyaket's path to political prominence began with his participation in the historic Siamese Revolution of 1932. On June 24, 1932, he joined the coup group known as the People's Party (Khana Ratsadon), which staged a bloodless revolution that ended Siam's centuries-long absolute monarchy under the Chakri dynasty.[^16][^17] The People's Party had been formed in 1927 by a group of Siamese students studying in Paris, including Pridi Banomyong and Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who met at a hotel and founded what became the revolutionary movement.[^18]

The revolution was driven by dissatisfaction with economic crisis and what was perceived as incompetent government, as well as the rise of Western-educated non-royals like Thawi to positions of influence.[^19] The People's Party eventually grew to 102 members, separated into four main branches: the civilians led by Pridi Banomyong, the navy led by Luang Sinthusongkhramchai, the junior army officers led by Major Phibunsongkhram, and the senior officers led by Colonel Phot Phahonyothin.[^20] Most members were students educated abroad, primarily in the United Kingdom and France.[^21]

When the coup occurred on June 24, 1932, while King Prajadhipok was away from Bangkok, the revolutionaries seized control of the army and imprisoned royal officials.[^22] The King quickly agreed to rule under a constitution, writing that he "could not sit on a throne besmirched by blood."[^23] He signed a temporary charter on June 27, 1932, which began by announcing that "the highest power in the land belongs to all people."[^24] Thailand's first permanent constitution was granted on December 10, 1932, establishing the framework for democratic rule.[^25]

As one of the civilian members of the People's Party, Thawi became part of Thailand's new political elite.[^26] His background in agriculture and Western education made him a valuable administrator in the new constitutional order. He rose through various government positions, eventually becoming secretary general in the cabinet of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who served as prime minister from 1938 to 1944.[^27] During the Phibunsongkhram era, Thailand pursued aggressive nationalist policies and eventually allied with Japan during World War II.[^28]

Thawi later served as Minister of Education in the cabinet of Khuang Aphaiwong, who became prime minister in August 1944 after Phibunsongkhram resigned over the National Assembly's refusal to accept two bills.[^29][^30] Khuang was elected as a result of political maneuvering by Pridi Banomyong, who remained the effective power behind the scenes while serving as Regent.[^31] As wartime leader, Khuang outwardly cooperated with the Japanese occupiers while secretly shielding the Free Thai resistance movement that collaborated with the Allies.[^32]

## Major Achievements

Thawi Bunyaket's service as Minister of Education in Khuang Aphaiwong's wartime government represented his most significant policy role before becoming prime minister.[^33] During the 1930s and 1940s, Thai education was undergoing significant transformation, balancing Western-inspired modernization with nationalist efforts to assert Thai identity following the political transformation of 1932.[^34] The period was characterized by the development of "Thainess" policies in education, with school buildings and curricula adapted to meet nationalist goals while incorporating modern Western educational methods.[^35]

As an agricultural expert with French training, Thawi brought technical expertise to government during a crucial period when Thailand's agricultural sector faced enormous challenges.[^36] The conservative approach to agricultural policy that characterized successive governments between 1900 and 1940 meant minimal government investment in infrastructure or expansion of modern services.[^37] By the late 1930s, Thailand remained virtually without roads, with most goods transported on rivers and canals.[^38] Agricultural growth was driven primarily by area expansion rather than productivity improvements.[^39]

Thawi's most historically significant achievement came with his brief tenure as Prime Minister of Thailand. On August 31, 1945, following the defeat of Japan and the end of World War II, Khuang Aphaiwong resigned to make way for a new administration representing the Free Thai forces who had resisted Japanese occupation.[^40] Thawi was elected prime minister and formed Thailand's 12th administration.[^41]

However, Thawi was chosen primarily because the preferred candidate, Seni Pramoj—the Thai ambassador to Washington who had refused to deliver Thailand's declaration of war to the United States and subsequently organized the Free Thai Movement with American assistance—was not yet available to take office.[^42][^43] Seventeen days after his election, on September 17, 1945, Thawi resigned to free the position for Seni Pramoj, who had returned from Washington to assume leadership.[^44]

During his 18-day tenure, Thawi served as a caretaker prime minister during one of the most critical transitional periods in Thai history.[^45] The post-war government faced enormous challenges, including Allied occupation by British-Indian forces under Major-General Geoffrey Charles Evans, negotiations over war reparations, and the restoration of territories Thailand had annexed during the war.[^46] On August 16, 1945, Regent Pridi Banomyong had proclaimed Thailand's declaration of war against the United Kingdom null and void, declaring it contrary to the will of the Thai people—a crucial step in positioning Thailand favorably with the Allies.[^47]

Later in his career, Thawi became President of the Constitutional Drafting Committee in the government of Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat.[^48] Sarit, who led a coup in 1957 and became prime minister in February 1959, established a highly centralized and authoritarian government, suspending the constitution, dissolving parliament, and banning political parties.[^49] After Sarit suspended the constitution in 1958, a committee was established to write a new one, though the process proceeded slowly and a new permanent constitution remained incomplete for nearly a decade.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Thawi Bunyaket's political career was marked by several controversial associations and decisions that reflected the complex moral compromises of Thai politics during wartime and authoritarian rule. His service as secretary general in Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram's cabinet placed him at the center of one of Thailand's most controversial wartime governments.[^51] After Japan invaded Thailand on December 7-8, 1941, Phibunsongkhram's government quickly capitulated after only five hours of fighting and signed a formal alliance with Japan on December 21, 1941.[^52]

On January 25, 1942, Thailand declared war on the United States and the United Kingdom under Phibunsongkhram's leadership.[^53] While Thawi's exact role in these decisions as secretary general is not well-documented, his position in the cabinet implicated him in the government's collaboration with Japanese forces. Thailand's alliance with Japan was motivated by calculations that cooperation would be profitable and help Thailand gain Indochinese territories.[^54] During the occupation, Thailand retained control of its armed forces and internal affairs but participated in Japan's war efforts.[^55]

The historical record remains unclear about Thawi's personal stance toward the Japanese alliance or whether he maintained any connections with the Free Thai resistance movement that operated underground during this period.[^56] Unlike some officials who openly supported the resistance or quietly aided Allied operations, there is no documented evidence of Thawi engaging in anti-Japanese activities while serving in Phibunsongkhram's government. This silence in the historical record has led some to question whether he was a pragmatic opportunist who served whatever regime was in power.

Thawi's brief 18-day premiership itself has been criticized as a political arrangement lacking democratic legitimacy.[^57] He was essentially a placeholder prime minister, chosen not for his leadership qualities or policy vision but simply because the actual preferred candidate was not yet available.[^58] This arrangement reflected the backroom political maneuvering that characterized Thai politics during this transitional period, with power brokers like Pridi Banomyong orchestrating governmental changes behind the scenes.[^59]

The scramble for power among various factions in late 1945 created deep political divisions among civilian leaders that destroyed their potential for making a common stand against the resurgent political force of the military in the immediate post-war years.[^60] Thawi's willingness to serve as a temporary figurehead prime minister arguably contributed to this political instability and the weakening of civilian democratic institutions.

Most controversially, Thawi later served as President of the Constitutional Drafting Committee under Field Marshal Sarit Thanarat, one of Thailand's most authoritarian military dictators.[^61] Sarit's regime, which lasted from 1959 until his death in 1963, was characterized by extreme centralization of power, suspension of democratic processes, and suppression of political opposition.[^62] By lending his credentials and reputation to Sarit's constitutional committee, Thawi provided legitimacy to a dictatorial regime that had no genuine intention of restoring democratic governance—the committee worked for nearly ten years without producing a constitution.[^63]

Critics have argued that Thawi's career exemplified a pattern common among Thai politicians of his generation: revolutionary idealism in overthrowing the absolute monarchy, followed by pragmatic collaboration with successive authoritarian regimes, whether military or otherwise.[^64] His willingness to serve under both Phibunsongkhram's collaborationist wartime government and Sarit's authoritarian regime suggests a political philosophy centered on administrative technocracy rather than democratic principles.[^65]

## Personal Life

Very little is known about Thawi Bunyaket's personal life, family relationships, or private interests.[^66] Historical records and biographical sources focus almost exclusively on his political career and official positions, leaving his personal character largely undocumented. This absence of personal detail is characteristic of historical accounts of many mid-level Thai political figures from this era, where official biographies emphasized public service over private matters.

What can be inferred about Thawi's character comes primarily from his educational background and career choices. His pursuit of agricultural studies at two prestigious European institutions—Cambridge and the École nationale supérieure d'Agronomie de Grignon—suggests a serious-minded individual interested in applying scientific knowledge to Thailand's development challenges.[^67] The field of agriculture was fundamental to Thailand's economy and the livelihood of its people, indicating that Thawi may have been motivated by practical concerns about improving his country's economic foundation.[^68]

His involvement with the People's Party and participation in the 1932 revolution as a young man suggests idealistic commitments to constitutional governance and ending absolute monarchy.[^69] However, his later willingness to serve in various governments regardless of their democratic credentials suggests either a pragmatic evolution of his political philosophy or perhaps a technocratic view that professional administrative service transcended particular regime types.[^70]

There is no available information about whether Thawi was married, had children, or maintained close friendships with other political figures.[^71] His social relationships within Thailand's political elite remain undocumented in accessible historical sources. Unlike more prominent figures from the 1932 revolution such as Pridi Banomyong or Phibunsongkhram, whose personal lives and relationships have been extensively studied, Thawi remains a shadowy figure whose private life has been lost to history.[^72]

Thawi Bunyaket died on November 3, 1971, just one week before what would have been his 67th birthday.[^73] The circumstances of his death and any final assessments he may have made of his political career are not recorded in available sources. He lived long enough to witness Thailand's continued political instability, including multiple coups, constitutional revisions, and the ongoing struggle between military and civilian governance that characterized Thai politics throughout the Cold War era.[^74]

## Legacy

Thawi Bunyaket's legacy is primarily defined by a single historical footnote: serving as Thailand's shortest-tenured prime minister at just 18 days.[^75] This record has endured for over eight decades and represents an unusual distinction in Thai political history. While other prime ministers are remembered for major policies, reforms, or political movements they led, Thawi is remembered almost exclusively for the brevity of his tenure.[^76]

His role as a member of the People's Party that overthrew absolute monarchy in 1932 connects him to one of the most significant events in Thai history.[^77] The 1932 revolution irreversibly changed the face of Thai politics, ending 150 years of absolute monarchy under the Chakri dynasty and establishing constitutional governance.[^78] However, among the 102 members of the People's Party, Thawi occupies a relatively minor place in historical memory compared to leading figures like Pridi Banomyong and Plaek Phibunsongkhram.[^79]

The 1932 revolution's legacy itself has been contested in Thai politics, with periods of celebration and suppression of its memory depending on which faction controlled the government.[^80] Military regimes have often downplayed the democratic aspirations of the revolution, while civilian democratic movements have celebrated it as Thailand's founding democratic moment.[^81] Thawi's participation in this event connects him to these broader debates about Thai political identity and the meaning of democracy in Thai society.[^82]

His service in various capacities across different regimes—from the revolutionary People's Party government to Phibunsongkhram's collaborationist wartime administration to Sarit's authoritarian regime—reflects the complex trajectories of many Thai politicians who lived through the turbulent mid-20th century.[^83] This pattern of service under ideologically diverse governments was common among Thailand's Western-educated administrative class, who often viewed themselves as technocratic servants of the Thai state rather than adherents to particular political ideologies.[^84]

Thawi's 18-day premiership has come to symbolize the political instability and factional maneuvering that characterized Thailand's immediate post-World War II period.[^85] The scramble for power in late 1945, in which Thawi served as a placeholder prime minister, exemplified the inability of civilian leaders to present a united front against military domination of Thai politics.[^86] This weakness contributed to the military's resurgence as the dominant political force in subsequent decades.[^87]

From an institutional perspective, Thawi's work on constitutional drafting under Sarit Thanarat represents a paradoxical legacy.[^88] While constitutional committees ostensibly work to establish rule of law and democratic governance, Sarit's committee served primarily to provide a veneer of legitimacy to authoritarian rule without producing meaningful constitutional protections.[^89] This experience reflected a broader pattern in Thai political development where democratic forms were maintained while authoritarian substance prevailed.[^90]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who take a sympathetic view of Thawi Bunyaket emphasize his role as a modernizer and technocrat who contributed to Thailand's administrative development during a crucial period of transition.[^91] His Western education at prestigious institutions like Cambridge and the École nationale supérieure d'Agronomie de Grignon provided him with expertise that Thailand needed to modernize its agricultural sector and government administration.[^92] Supporters note that bringing scientific agricultural knowledge back to Thailand represented a form of patriotic service, helping to improve the foundation of the country's rice-based economy.[^93]

Defenders of Thawi's record argue that his participation in the 1932 revolution demonstrated genuine commitment to ending absolute monarchy and establishing constitutional governance.[^94] The Siamese Revolution of 1932 was a bloodless transition that avoided the violence and chaos that characterized many other transitions from monarchy to constitutional rule.[^95] Thawi's willingness to risk his career by joining the People's Party conspirators showed courage and dedication to political reform.[^96]

Some historians contextualize his service in Phibunsongkhram's wartime government by noting the extremely difficult position Thailand faced during World War II.[^97] Caught between Japanese military power and Allied opposition, Thai officials had limited options for navigation.[^98] Those who emphasize this perspective argue that administrative officials like Thawi were doing their best to maintain governmental functions during an unprecedented crisis, and that judging them by peacetime standards is unfair.[^99]

Thawi's brief tenure as prime minister, while seemingly insignificant, can be interpreted as performing an important transitional function during a critical moment.[^100] His willingness to serve temporarily and then step aside for Seni Pramoj demonstrated political flexibility and lack of personal ambition for power.[^101] In a political culture often characterized by leaders clinging to power, Thawi's voluntary resignation after 18 days could be seen as admirable restraint.[^102]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars view Thawi Bunyaket as emblematic of Thailand's failed democratic transition and the triumph of authoritarian pragmatism over democratic principles.[^103] Despite participating in a revolution that promised to establish popular sovereignty and constitutional governance, Thawi subsequently served in governments that betrayed these ideals.[^104] His career trajectory suggests that the Western-educated reformers of the 1932 revolution were ultimately more committed to their own positions in the administrative elite than to genuine democratic transformation.[^105]

Critics particularly condemn his service as secretary general in Phibunsongkhram's collaborationist wartime government.[^106] While Thailand's position during World War II was undoubtedly difficult, many Thai officials found ways to resist or undermine Japanese occupation through the Free Thai Movement.[^107] Thawi's apparent absence from resistance activities suggests he prioritized personal advancement over national interest during a crucial moral test.[^108] His willingness to serve a government that had declared war on democratic nations like the United States and United Kingdom reveals troubling pragmatism.[^109]

His 18-day premiership is viewed by critics as a symptom of the political dysfunction and elite manipulation that prevented Thailand from developing genuine democratic institutions.[^110] Rather than being chosen through democratic processes or popular support, Thawi was installed through backroom deals among political bosses like Pridi Banomyong.[^111] His willingness to serve as a placeholder prime minister demonstrated acceptance of a political culture based on patronage and manipulation rather than democratic accountability.[^112]

Most damning to his reputation is Thawi's service as President of the Constitutional Drafting Committee under Sarit Thanarat's authoritarian regime.[^113] Sarit suspended the constitution, dissolved parliament, banned political parties, and concentrated all power in his own hands.[^114] The constitutional committee that Thawi led was a transparent façade, working for nearly a decade without producing a constitution while Sarit ruled by decree.[^115] By lending his credentials to this sham exercise, Thawi helped legitimize one of Thailand's most repressive dictatorships.[^116]

Critics argue that Thawi's career represents the failure of Thailand's Western-educated elite to translate their exposure to democratic ideals into genuine democratic practice.[^117] Despite studying at Cambridge and in France—countries with strong democratic traditions—Thawi apparently absorbed only technical knowledge while remaining committed to hierarchical, authoritarian political culture.[^118] His legacy thus exemplifies the superficial nature of Thailand's engagement with democracy, where constitutional forms mask authoritarian substance.[^119]

## Famous Quotes

Due to the limited historical documentation of Thawi Bunyaket's public statements and the brevity of his time as prime minister, there are no widely recorded famous quotes attributed to him.[^120] Unlike more prominent political figures from Thailand's 1932 revolutionary generation, Thawi did not leave behind a substantial body of speeches, writings, or public pronouncements that have been preserved in the historical record.[^121]

However, Thawi did author written works about Thailand's role during World War II, including "Additional Facts on the Situation in Thailand during World War 2," which appears in Direk Jayanama's book about Thailand and World War II.[^122] This work is cited in academic research discussing Thailand's wartime situation and relationship with Japan, though specific quotations from it are not readily available in English-language sources.[^123]

The absence of memorable quotes from Thawi's brief premiership reflects both the transitional nature of his role and the limited public communication that characterized his 18-day tenure.[^124] As a caretaker prime minister serving between the end of World War II and the installation of Free Thai leader Seni Pramoj, Thawi's government focused on administrative continuity rather than policy announcements or visionary statements.[^125]
