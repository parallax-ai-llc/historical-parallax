## Summary

Chrysostomos of Smyrna was the Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of Smyrna who was martyred during the destruction of Smyrna in 1922. When Turkish forces entered the city, he refused to flee, choosing to remain with his flock. He was handed over to a mob by Turkish authorities and was beaten, mutilated, and killed in the streets. His martyrdom became a powerful symbol of the tragedy of the Greek community in Asia Minor.
