## Summary

Israel Salanter was a Lithuanian rabbi who founded the Musar (Ethics) movement in Orthodox Judaism. He emphasized the ethical dimension of Jewish observance, arguing that moral self-improvement was as important as Talmudic study. He established musar study halls where students would practice ethical introspection. His movement profoundly influenced Lithuanian yeshiva education and remains active in Orthodox Judaism today.
