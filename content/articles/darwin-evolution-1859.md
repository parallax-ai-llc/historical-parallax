## Overview

Charles Darwin's publication of *On the Origin of Species* on November 24, 1859, radically transformed humanity's understanding of life on Earth. Darwin proposed that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors through a process he called **Natural Selection**. It challenged the prevailing religious view of divine creation and fixed species. Though controversial ("The Monkey Man"), the theory of evolution became the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life through a purely natural mechanism.

## Background

### The Voyage of the Beagle (1831-1836)

**22-Year-Old Naturalist:**
Darwin joined HMS *Beagle* as unsalaried naturalist. Intended to be clergyman.

**The Journey:**
5 years around world. South America, Australia, Africa.
Observed fossils, geological changes.

**Galapagos Islands (1835):**
Noticed finches and tortoises differed slightly from island to island.
*Insight:* Perhaps they changed to fit their environment?

### The "Mystery of Mysteries"

**Home in England:**
Darwin spent 20 years studying barnacles, pigeons, worms. Secretly developed his theory.
Builds case:
1. **Variation:** Individuals differ.
2. **Heritability:** Traits pass to offspring.
3. **Competition:** Malthus—more born than can survive.
4. **Selection:** Those with advantageous traits survive and reproduce ("Survival of the Fittest").

## The Letter (1858)

### Alfred Russel Wallace

**Panic:**
June 1858. Darwin received letter from Wallace (naturalist in Indonesia). Wallace had exact same idea!

**Gentlemanly Arrangement:**
Joint paper read at Linnean Society (July 1, 1858). Neither attended. World barely noticed.

**The Book:**
Darwin rushed to write his "abstract"—*On the Origin of Species*.

## The Book (1859)

### *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection*

**Best Seller:**
Sold out to booksellers on first day.

**Argument:**
"Descent with modification." Did not discuss human evolution (only one line: "Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history").

---

## The Debate

### Oxford Evolution Debate (1860)

**Huxley vs. Wilberforce:**
"Darwin's Bulldog" Thomas Huxley vs. Bishop Samuel Wilberforce ("Soapy Sam").

**The Slap:**
Wilberforce asked if Huxley was descended from monkey on grandmother's or grandfather's side.
Huxley replied he'd rather have an ape for an ancestor than a man who used his gifts to obscure truth.

### Religious Reaction

**Conflict:**
Contradicted Genesis literalism. Removed design/purpose from nature.
"God is dead?"

---

## Impact

### Scientific

Unified biology. Explained taxonomy, embryology, fossils, adaptation.

### Social

**Social Darwinism:**
Herbert Spencer (not Darwin) applied "survival of fittest" to human society. Used to justify imperialism, racism, eugenics. (Darwin disagreed).

---

## Legacy

**Modern Synthesis (1930s-40s):**
Combined Darwin (selection) with Mendel (genetics). = Modern Evolutionary Biology.

**Still Contested:**
Scopes Trial (1925) to present. But scientifically unquestioned.
