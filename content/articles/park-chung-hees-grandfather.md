## Summary

Park Yung-gyu (박영규, 1840–1914) was a landowner from the Goryeong Park clan during the late Joseon dynasty and Korean Empire period. He is primarily remembered as the grandfather of Park Chung-hee, South Korea's third president. While not a notable historical or political figure in his own right, Park Yung-gyu lived during a significant period of Korean history and represented the landowning class of his era.

## Early Life and Family Background

Park Yung-gyu was born in 1840 during the late Joseon dynasty. He belonged to the Goryeong Park clan (고령 박씨), a prominent yangban family with roots in the Goryeong region of Korea. During this period, yangban families maintained their status through land ownership and education, though the civil service examination system was declining in prestige.

## Land Ownership and Economic Status

Park Yung-gyu accumulated wealth through land ownership, particularly in the Yakmok area. As a landowner, he represented the economic foundation of the yangban class during the late Joseon and early Korean Empire periods. His property holdings provided the family's primary source of income and social standing.

## Family and Descendants

Park Yung-gyu had three sons, one of whom was Park Sung-bin (박성빈), who would become the father of Park Chung-hee. He hoped that his son would pursue advancement through the gwageo civil service examinations, reflecting the traditional aspirations of yangban families during this era. This educational ambition, though unfulfilled in his immediate family, would eventually manifest in his grandson's remarkable rise to prominence.

## Life During the Korean Empire

Park Yung-gyu lived through the period of the Korean Empire (1897–1910), when Korea transitioned from late Joseon dynasty governance. This was a tumultuous era marked by internal reforms, foreign pressures, and eventual Japanese colonization. As a private citizen and landowner, Park Yung-gyu navigated this period of significant historical change while maintaining his family's economic and social status.

## Legacy

Park Yung-gyu died in 1914, during the early period of Japanese colonial rule. While he was not a historically significant figure in his own right, his descendants—particularly his grandson Park Chung-hee—would play major roles in twentieth-century Korean history. His life represents the experience of the landowning yangban class during Korea's transition from traditional dynasty to colonial period.
