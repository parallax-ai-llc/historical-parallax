## Summary

Gojong (born September 8, 1852; died January 21, 1919) was the 26th King of the Joseon Dynasty and the first Emperor of the Korean Empire.[^1] Ascending the throne at age 12, his reign (1863–1907) spanned the most turbulent period in Korean history, as the "Hermit Kingdom" was forced open by foreign powers. Gojong struggled to modernize his country through the **Gwangmu Reform** and balance the competing interests of China, Japan, Russia, and Western powers. His declaration of the **Korean Empire** in 1897 was a bold attempt to assert sovereign equality, but he was ultimately forced to abdicate by Japan in 1907. His sudden death in 1919, widely believed to be by poisoning, sparked the **March 1st Movement**, the catalyst for Korea's independence struggle.[^2]

## Early Reign and Regents

### The Child King and the Daewongun
Gojong was not born a crown prince but was a distant royal relative living in poverty throughout his childhood. When King Cheoljong died heirless, Gojong was chosen as the successor at age 12. For the first decade of his reign, his father, the **Heungseon Daewongun**, ruled as a powerful regent.[^3] The Daewongun pursued a strict policy of isolationism (closed-door policy) and persecuted Catholics, while successfully rebuilding the royal authority symbolized by the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace.

### Queen Min's Ascendance
In 1873, Gojong officially assumed direct rule, supported by his wife, **Queen Min** (later Empress Myeongseong), who advocated for a more open foreign policy to counter the Daewongun's influence.[^4] This marked the beginning of Korea's tumultuous "opening" period.

## Modernization and Crisis

### Opening the Hermit Kingdom
Gojong's reign saw the signing of the **Treaty of Ganghwa (1876)** with Japan, Korea's first unequal modern treaty.[^5] Recognizing the need for reform, Gojong established new government offices and sent envoys to Japan and the US to study modernization.

### Internal Strife
His efforts were constantly hampered by internal rebellions and coups:
*   **Imo Incident (1882):** A soldier's riot that temporarily brought the Daewongun back to power.
*   **Gapsin Coup (1884):** A radical reformist coup backed by Japan that lasted only three days before being crushed by Chinese troops.[^6]
*   **Donghak Peasant Revolution (1894):** A massive peasant uprising that triggered the **First Sino-Japanese War** fought on Korean soil.

### The Gabo Reform (1894)
Under Japanese pressure during the war, Gojong's government passed the **Gabo Reform**, which officially abolished the traditional class system (Yangban system), slavery, and the civil service exam (Gwageo), fundamentally altering Korean society.[^7]

## The Korean Empire (1897–1910)

Following the assassination of Queen Min by Japanese agents in 1895 and his own harrowing escape to the Russian Legation (Agwan Pacheon) in 1896, Gojong returned to Deoksugung Palace in 1897 determined to reassert sovereignty.[^8]

### Proclamation of Empire
On October 12, 1897, Gojong declared the founding of the **Korean Empire** (Daehan Jeguk) and crowned himself **Emperor Gwangmu**, putting himself on equal footing with the Emperors of China and Japan.[^9]

### Gwangmu Reform
Gojong launched the **Gwangmu Reform**, centered on the motto "Old Foundation, New Participation" (Gubon Sincham).
*   **Modernization:** He introduced electricity, streetcars, trains (Gyeongin Line), and telephone systems to Seoul.
*   **Land Survey:** He initiated a modern land survey to secure tax revenue.
*   **Military:** He strengthened the imperial guard and adopted modern weaponry, though usually funded by foreign loans.[^10]

## Downfall and Abdication

### Protectorate Treaty (1905)
Japan's victory in the **Russo-Japanese War (1905)** sealed Korea's fate. Japanese troops surrounded the palace, and the **Eulsa Treaty** was signed, stripping Korea of its diplomatic rights and making it a Japanese protectorate. Gojong refused to sign the treaty, declaring it invalid.[^11]

### Hague Secret Emissary Affair (1907)
In a desperate final diplomatic gamble, Gojong secretly sent three special envoys to the **Second Hague Peace Conference** in the Netherlands to expose Japan's aggression to the world. The envoys were barred from entering. Japan used this "violation" as a pretext to force Gojong to abdicate in favor of his son, Sunjong, on July 20, 1907.[^12]

## Death and Legacy

After abdication, Gojong lived in confinement at Deoksugung Palace. He died suddenly on **January 21, 1919**, at the age of 66.
*   **Poisoning Rumors:** The Japanese announced the cause of death as a cerebral hemorrhage, but rumors spread instantly that he had been poisoned with vinegar-laced Sikhye (rice punch) by pro-Japanese collaborators.[^13] Witnesses described his body swelling rapidly and his teeth falling out.
*   **March 1st Movement:** The public outrage over his death galvanized the nation. His funeral on March 1, 1919, became the staging ground for the reading of the Declaration of Independence and the nationwide Mansei protests against Japanese rule.[^14]
