## Summary

Saint Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225–1274) was an Italian Dominican friar, Catholic priest, and one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in Western civilization. Known as the "Angelic Doctor" and "Universal Doctor," he revolutionized Christian theology by synthesizing Aristotelian philosophy with Catholic doctrine in his masterwork, the *Summa Theologica*. His natural law theory and systematic approach to faith and reason shaped Catholic intellectual tradition for centuries, earning him recognition as a Doctor of the Church and patron saint of students and universities. Despite posthumous controversies and condemnations, his philosophical legacy continues to influence modern ethics, metaphysics, and theology.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Thomas Aquinas was born circa 1225 at the family castle of Roccasecca, near Aquino, in the Kingdom of Sicily (present-day Lazio, Italy), though some scholars suggest 1227 as a more probable date.[^3][^4] He came from nobility: his father, Landulf VI of Aquino, was Lord of Roccasecca and a man of considerable means, while his mother, Theodora Galluccio, Countess of Teano, belonged to the Rossi branch of the Neapolitan Caracciolo family.[^5] Though the family descended from Emperors Frederick I and Henry VI, they were considered lower nobility.[^6] Thomas was the youngest of four sons and had two sisters, and his family's connections to power were significant—his uncle Sinibald served as abbot of Monte Cassino, the oldest Benedictine monastery.[^7]

At age five, Thomas began his early education at Monte Cassino, where the family intended him to follow his uncle into the abbacy—a typical career path for a younger son of Southern Italian nobility while his brothers pursued military careers.[^8] Around 1239, he began attending the University of Naples, where he encountered Aristotle's works for the first time.[^9] These philosophical texts would become the launching point for his own intellectual explorations and ultimately revolutionize medieval scholasticism.

In 1243, Thomas made a decision that shocked his aristocratic family: he secretly joined the Dominican Order, receiving the habit in 1244.[^10] The Dominicans were a mendicant (begging) order, representing a dramatic departure from the wealth and prestige his family expected. When Thomas traveled to Rome, his brothers captured him and returned him to the family castle at Monte San Giovanni Campano, where he was held captive for approximately one year as his family attempted to dissuade him from joining the Dominicans.[^11] Despite family pressure, including allegedly sending a temptress to his room (which he reportedly drove away with a burning brand from the fireplace), Thomas remained steadfast in his religious vocation.[^12]

## Rise to Power

After his release from family captivity, Thomas joined the Dominican community and began his meteoric academic ascent. In 1245, he traveled to Paris and then to Cologne in 1248 under the supervision of Albertus Magnus (Albert the Great), who was the leading figure in integrating Christian theology with Greek and Arabic philosophy.[^13] Thomas made such a profound impression on Albert that when Albert transferred to the University of Cologne, he took Thomas along as his personal assistant.[^14] Legend has it that Thomas's quiet demeanor led fellow students to mockingly call him the "Dumb Ox," to which Albert reportedly replied, "You call him the Dumb Ox, but in his teaching he will one day produce such a bellowing that it will be heard throughout the world."[^15]

When Albert was asked in 1252 to nominate a student to pursue an advanced degree in theology at the University of Paris, he chose Thomas, even though he was still two years younger than the minimum required age.[^16] Thomas was ordained as a priest in Cologne in 1250 and went on to teach theology at the University of Paris.[^17] By 1256, at just 32 years of age, Thomas was teaching at Paris as a Master of Theology—the medieval equivalent of a full university professorship.[^18] This represented an extraordinary achievement for someone so young, particularly in an era when academic promotion typically came later in life.

His reputation as a brilliant theologian grew rapidly. After teaching in Paris for three years, the Dominicans moved Thomas back to Italy, where he taught in Naples (1259-1261), Orvieto (1261-1265), and Rome (1265-1268).[^19] During this Italian period, he served at the papal court and had access to newly translated Greek texts, enabling him to deepen his engagement with Aristotle's complete corpus. In 1268, Thomas was summoned back to Paris for an unusual second term as master of theology, partly to combat the rise of "Averroism" or "radical Aristotelianism" that was causing theological controversy at the universities.[^20]

## Major Achievements

### The Summa Theologica

Thomas Aquinas's greatest achievement was the *Summa Theologica* (or *Summa Theologiae*), begun in 1265 and left unfinished at his death in 1274.[^21] Conceived as an instructional guide for teachers and novices and a compendium of all approved Catholic teachings, this monumental work systematically addresses virtually every major theological and philosophical question.[^22] The *Summa* is divided into four parts: the *prima pars* (1a) on the nature of God and the created world, including human nature; the *prima secundae* (1a2ae) on human action and what shapes it (passion, virtue, vice, law, grace); the *secunda secundae* (2a2ae) on theological and philosophical virtues in detail; and the *tertia pars* (3a) on Christ and the sacraments.[^23]

What distinguished Thomas's work was his unprecedented synthesis: he collected and systematized the philosophical knowledge and thinking of previous eras—particularly Aristotle—and applied them to Christian theology.[^24] This comprehensive synthesis of Christian theology and Aristotelian philosophy influenced Roman Catholic doctrine for centuries and was eventually adopted as the official philosophy of the Church in 1917.[^25] Over merely two decades of literary activity, Aquinas produced more than eight million words—eight times more than survives from Aristotle himself.[^26]

### The Summa Contra Gentiles

Between 1259 and 1265, Thomas composed the *Summa contra Gentiles*, a four-book treatise designed to present Christian truth to non-Christians, particularly Muslims and other "Gentiles."[^27] Unlike the *Summa Theologica*, which assumed Christian faith, this work relied more heavily on philosophical reasoning accessible to all rational beings, making arguments that didn't presuppose acceptance of Christian revelation.[^28] This demonstrated Thomas's conviction that faith and reason, properly understood, could never contradict each other because both originate from the same divine source.[^29]

### The Five Ways

In the *Summa Theologica*, Thomas presented his famous "Five Ways"—five philosophical arguments for God's existence.[^30] These included: (1) the argument from motion (the Unmoved Mover); (2) the argument from efficient cause; (3) the argument from possibility and necessity (contingency); (4) the argument from gradation of being; and (5) the argument from design (teleological argument).[^31] Later thinkers classified all five as variants of the cosmological argument for divine existence, and they remain central to natural theology and philosophy of religion.[^32]

### Natural Law Theory

Thomas developed an influential theory of natural law that profoundly shaped Western legal and ethical thought.[^33] For Aquinas, natural law represents the portion of God's eternal law that pertains to human beings and is discoverable through reason by examining human nature and the natural order.[^34] He articulated four types of law: eternal law (God's rational governance of creation), natural law (the portion of eternal law accessible to human reason), human law (positive laws created by human authorities), and divine law (revealed in Scripture).[^35] His first principle of natural law—"good is to be done and pursued, and evil avoided"—provides the foundation for all other moral precepts.[^36] This natural law framework influenced thinkers from John Locke to modern human rights theorists.[^37]

### Philosophical Contributions

Thomas's philosophical achievements extended beyond theology. His systematic reworking of Aristotelianism reshaped Western philosophy and provoked countless elaborations and disputations among later medieval and modern philosophers.[^38] He demonstrated that faith and reason are complementary rather than contradictory, never compromising Christian doctrine but modifying and correcting Aristotelian philosophy wherever it clashed with Christian belief.[^39] His work influenced modern virtue ethics, aesthetics, cognitive theory, and metaphysics.[^40] Globally, Thomas ranks among the ten most influential philosophers in the Western tradition, with his thought shaping intellectuals across culturally diverse nations including Argentina, Canada, England, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, Spain, and the United States.[^41]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Ecclesiastical Condemnations

Thomas Aquinas's embrace of Aristotelian philosophy aroused significant controversy during his lifetime and immediately after his death. When he returned to the University of Paris in 1268, many Franciscans and conservative theologians viewed his integration of Aristotle with suspicion, fearing it contradicted Christian doctrine.[^42] The Franciscan master William of Baglione accused Thomas of encouraging Averroists—radical interpreters of Aristotle whose views seemed incompatible with Christianity.[^43]

In 1270, Étienne Tempier, bishop of Paris, condemned certain Averroist theses, and some scholars believe these condemnations were directed at least implicitly against Aquinas's teaching.[^44] More dramatically, in 1277—just three years after Thomas's death—Tempier issued a sweeping condemnation of 219 propositions, including two that concerned matters taught by Thomas.[^45] Essentially, Aquinas was condemned by the Church as a heretic in 1277.[^46] Archbishop Robert Kilwardby similarly considered some of Thomas's basic views about nature and divinity almost heretical.[^47] The Franciscan Order even banned the *Summa Theologica* from those untrained in considering his ideas, fearing its controversial content.[^48]

### Theological Disputes

One particularly contentious issue was Thomas's teaching that the world's creation in time cannot be demonstrated by reason alone, since there is no philosophical contradiction in a created universe having existed from eternity.[^49] He addressed this in *De aeternitate mundi, contra murmurantes* (On the Eternity of the World, against Grumblers), defending the Aristotelian and Averroist position on the beginninglessness of the world against theological critics.[^50] Additionally, disputes with Franciscans over mendicant poverty and evangelical life made his second regency at Paris much more difficult than his first.[^51]

### Views on Women

From a modern perspective, Thomas Aquinas's views on women represent perhaps his most problematic legacy. Following Aristotelian biology, Aquinas taught that women are essentially "misbegotten males"—defective versions of the male form.[^52] In the *Summa Theologiae*, he argued that women were created solely for procreation and childcare, and that they are inferior to men in both mind and body.[^53] He wrote that "woman is subject because of her deficiency of reason" and that she is related to man "as to her principle and her end, since Eve was made from and for the sake of Adam."[^54]

Aquinas believed that women were not generally perfected in wisdom and therefore should not teach, and that God's image was dimmer in women than in men.[^55] Modern feminist scholars of religion and ethics have rightly critiqued these views as deeply misogynistic, noting that Aquinas's sophisticated reasoning process was deployed to see women's whole essence as naturally defective.[^56] While some defenders argue that Aquinas showed a degree of nuance—combining women's subjection with equality in grace and teaching equality in marriage—his views remain indefensible by contemporary standards and had harmful influence on Christian attitudes toward women for centuries.[^57] As one scholar noted, "When one actually reads Aquinas, it is clear he was aligned with most medievals in having unfortunate views of women, which no serious modern scholar denies."[^58]

## Personal Life

Thomas Aquinas lived the austere life of a Dominican friar, dedicated to poverty, chastity, and obedience. Unlike secular clergy who might accumulate wealth or clerics from other orders who lived in wealthy monasteries, Thomas embraced the mendicant ideal, depending on alms and the support of his religious community.[^59] His personal habits reflected intense intellectual focus: he was known for his ability to dictate to multiple secretaries simultaneously on different topics, and for becoming so absorbed in thought that he was oblivious to his surroundings.[^60]

Contemporary accounts describe Thomas as a large man of gentle disposition, whose quiet demeanor belied his intellectual brilliance.[^61] He maintained close relationships with fellow Dominicans, particularly his secretary and confessor Reginald of Piperno, who accompanied him throughout his later years and witnessed his final mystical experiences.[^62] Despite his family's initial opposition to his religious vocation, Thomas remained connected to his aristocratic roots—his brother Raynald, who had once helped imprison him to prevent his joining the Dominicans, later supported his work.[^63]

Thomas's devotional life was deeply mystical. Beyond his rational theological work, he experienced profound religious experiences, including a vision in which Christ allegedly spoke to him from a crucifix, saying "You have written well of me, Thomas. What reward would you have for your labor?"[^64] His response—that he desired only God himself—reflected the fundamental orientation of his entire life and thought.[^65]

### The Mystical Vision and Final Days

On December 6, 1273, while celebrating Mass at the chapel of St. Nicholas, Thomas experienced a profound mystical revelation that changed everything.[^66] After this vision, he ceased writing, leaving the *Summa Theologica* unfinished. When his secretary Reginald urged him to continue, Thomas replied: "I can write no more. All that I have written seems like straw."[^67] Another account records him saying, "Such secrets have been revealed to me that all I have written now appears to be of little value."[^68] Brother Dominic Caserta, who witnessed the event, reported that Thomas was in ecstasy during the experience.[^69]

In January 1274, Pope Gregory X summoned Thomas to attend the Second Council of Lyon.[^70] However, traveling on a donkey along the Appian Way, he struck his head on the branch of a fallen tree and became seriously ill.[^71] After briefly convalescing at Monte Cassino, he set out again but had to stop at the Cistercian Fossanova Abbey after falling ill again.[^72] The monks nursed him for several days. As he received last rites, Thomas prayed: "I have written and taught much about this very holy Body, and about the other sacraments in the faith of Christ, and about the Holy Roman Church, to whose correction I expose and submit everything I have written."[^73] He died on the morning of March 7, 1274, at age 48 or 49, and was buried at the monastery.[^74]

## Legacy

### Canonization and Ecclesiastical Recognition

The Church's initial condemnations of some of Thomas's views were eventually reversed as his orthodoxy and brilliance became undeniable. Thomas Aquinas was canonized on July 18, 1323, by Pope John XXII, fifty years after his death, at a ceremony in Avignon Cathedral attended by the entire Avignon clergy and Robert, King of Naples.[^75] Remarkably, when the devil's advocate at his canonization objected that there were no miracles, one cardinal answered, "there are as many miracles (in his life) as articles (in his *Summa*)."[^76] The canonization was fiercely contested by Franciscans who rejected his doctrines, demonstrating that theological tensions persisted even as official recognition came.[^77]

Pope Pius V proclaimed St. Thomas Aquinas a Doctor of the Church on April 15, 1567, ranking his feast with those of the four great Latin fathers: Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory I.[^78] He received the titles "Angelic Doctor" (*Doctor Angelicus*), "Universal Doctor" (*Doctor Communis*), and "Common Doctor," reflecting his unparalleled influence on Catholic thought.[^79] In 1880, Pope Leo XIII declared him patron of all Catholic universities, academies, colleges, and schools, and patron saint of students.[^80] This patronage reflects the central role his work played—and continues to play—in Catholic education worldwide.

### Thomism and Philosophical Influence

Thomas's thought spawned an entire school of philosophy and theology known as Thomism, which became enormously influential both within and beyond Catholic contexts.[^81] In 1917, the Catholic Church officially adopted his philosophical synthesis as the church's authoritative philosophy.[^82] Under papal directives, study of his works became a core requirement for those seeking ordination as priests or deacons, as well as for students in religious formation and the sacred disciplines.[^83]

Beyond ecclesiastical contexts, Thomism became an important school of thought in secular philosophy.[^84] Thomas's systematic approach to metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and political philosophy influenced countless thinkers across centuries. His natural law theory shaped Enlightenment philosophers like John Locke (despite significant differences in their approaches), and remains central to debates on human rights and morality.[^85] Modern philosophers and theologians, including Alasdair MacIntyre, continue to draw inspiration from Aquinas's ideas on virtue ethics, the relationship between faith and reason, and the common good.[^86]

### Cultural and Intellectual Impact

Thomas's influence extended beyond professional philosophy and theology into broader culture. His aesthetic theories, particularly the concept of *claritas* (clarity or radiance), deeply influenced modernist writer James Joyce, who extolled Thomas as second only to Aristotle among Western philosophers.[^87] More than 700 years after his death, Thomas's legacy endures in Catholic seminaries, universities, and beyond, with even secular scholars admiring his rigorous approach to philosophy, ethics, and metaphysics.[^88]

Expert Thomists emphasize that the Dominican priest who dedicated his life to writing and teaching has had an unparalleled influence on Catholic thought, forming how the Church functions even in the modern world.[^89] His relics were transferred in 1368 from Fossanova to the Church of the Jacobins in Toulouse, France—the mother church of the Dominican Order—where they remain in a golden reliquary beside the altar.[^90] After being moved to Saint Sernin during the French Revolution, the relics were returned to the Jacobins in 1974 when restoration was complete.[^91]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Thomas Aquinas praise him as one of history's greatest systematic thinkers who successfully demonstrated the compatibility of faith and reason. Scholars emphasize that he never compromised Christian doctrine but rather modified and corrected Aristotelian philosophy wherever necessary, creating a synthesis that enriched both theological and philosophical inquiry.[^92] His systematic method, rigorous argumentation, and comprehensive treatment of virtually every major philosophical and theological question set a standard for intellectual work that endures today.[^93]

Pope Leo XIII's 1879 encyclical *Aeterni Patris* promoted a revival of Thomistic philosophy, arguing that Thomas's thought provided the best philosophical foundation for addressing modern intellectual challenges.[^94] This Neo-Thomist movement influenced twentieth-century Catholic thinkers like Jacques Maritain, Étienne Gilson, and Bernard Lonergan, who adapted Thomistic principles to engage with contemporary philosophy, science, and culture.[^95] These scholars praised Thomas's balanced realism, his affirmation of both the material and spiritual dimensions of human existence, and his integration of reason and revelation.

Contemporary virtue ethicists, particularly those following Alasdair MacIntyre, have recovered Thomistic moral philosophy as an alternative to modern utilitarian and deontological approaches.[^96] They appreciate Thomas's emphasis on human flourishing (*eudaimonia*), the cultivation of virtues, and the teleological understanding of human nature—seeing these as resources for addressing moral fragmentation in contemporary society.[^97] Legal philosophers continue to engage with his natural law theory as a foundation for human rights and the critique of unjust laws.[^98]

### Negative Views

Critics of Aquinas challenge both his specific conclusions and his broader philosophical approach. From the perspective of modern science, his reliance on Aristotelian biology and physics—including the geocentric universe, the theory of four elements, and generation theory—has been thoroughly discredited.[^99] His views on women, derived from faulty Aristotelian biology, represent a particularly harmful legacy that contributed to centuries of gender discrimination within Christianity.[^100]

Some Protestant theologians have criticized Thomas's synthesis of faith and reason as compromising the transcendence of divine revelation by subjecting it to philosophical analysis.[^101] They argue that his natural theology overestimates human reason's ability to attain knowledge of God apart from revelation, and that his Aristotelian framework imported problematic philosophical assumptions into Christian doctrine.[^102] Reformed theologians particularly question whether Thomas's emphasis on analogical language about God adequately preserves divine incomprehensibility.[^103]

Modern philosophers have challenged various aspects of Thomistic metaphysics. His proofs for God's existence have been subjected to extensive critique, with philosophers questioning both their logical validity and their assumptions about causation, motion, and necessity.[^104] Some argue that his metaphysical framework—particularly the essence-existence distinction and the theory of analogical predication—involves conceptual confusions or unwarranted assumptions.[^105] Feminist philosophers and theologians have documented how his misogynistic views on women shaped Christian attitudes and practices in harmful ways that persist today.[^106]

Historical scholars also note that the institutional elevation of Thomism as "the" Catholic philosophy obscured the diversity of medieval thought and marginalized other important theological and philosophical traditions, including Franciscan, Augustinian, and mystical approaches.[^107] The codification of Thomism in seminary education sometimes resulted in rigid, formulaic applications of his thought rather than engagement with his dynamic, inquiring method.[^108]
