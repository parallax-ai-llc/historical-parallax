## Summary

János Bolyai was a Hungarian mathematician who independently developed non-Euclidean geometry at the same time as Nikolai Lobachevsky. His work was published as an appendix to his father's textbook in 1832. When Gauss praised the work but claimed to have known it already, Bolyai was devastated and published little afterward. His geometry was later essential to Einstein's relativity.
