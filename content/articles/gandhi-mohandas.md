## Summary

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948) was an Indian independence movement leader and pioneer of nonviolent resistance. Widely known by the honorific "Mahatma" (Great Soul), he is revered as the Father of Indian Independence.

## Early Life

Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, served as the diwan (prime minister) of Porbandar. [^1]

Gandhi married Kasturba at the age of 13, which was an arranged child marriage according to Indian customs at the time. In 1888, he left India to study law at University College London. [^2]

### Education and Early Career

- 1888-1891: Studied law in London, England
- 1891: Returned to India after becoming a barrister
- 1893: Moved to Durban, South Africa, working as a legal advisor for Indian merchants

## Middle Years

### South Africa Period (1893-1914)

In South Africa, Gandhi directly experienced racial discrimination against Indians. This experience became the catalyst for his political awakening. [^3]

In 1906, Gandhi initiated the 'Satyagraha' (truth-force) movement to resist discriminatory laws by the Transvaal government. This marked the beginning of nonviolent civil disobedience. [^4]

### Activities After Returning to India (1915-1947)

Upon returning to India in 1915, Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress (INC) and led the independence movement.

Major movements:
- **1919 Rowlatt Act Protest**: Resistance against laws restricting freedom of press and assembly
- **1920-1922 Non-Cooperation Movement**: Boycott of British goods and refusal of government positions
- **1930 Salt March**: A 386km march protesting British salt monopoly
- **1942 Quit India Movement**: "British, leave India"

## Later Life

Gandhi opposed the partition of India, but ultimately in 1947, India and Pakistan gained independence as separate nations. He worked to prevent Hindu-Muslim violence during the partition process. [^5]

On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse. His last words are said to have been "Hey Ram" (Oh God). [^6]

## Positive Perspectives

- **Symbol of Nonviolent Resistance**: Gandhi's Satyagraha philosophy influenced civil rights movements worldwide. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and others drew from his methodology. [^7]
- **Father of Indian Independence**: Recognized as the key leader who guided India to independence from British colonial rule.
- **Advocate for Religious Harmony**: Dedicated himself to reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims.
- **Practitioner of Simple Living**: Inspired many through his practice of frugality and self-sufficiency.
- **Nobel Peace Prize Nominee**: Nominated five times for the Nobel Peace Prize but never received it. In 1948, the Nobel Committee mourned his death and did not award the Peace Prize that year. [^8]

## Negative Perspectives

- **Early Position on Caste System**: Initially made statements accepting the caste system, and although he later changed his position, he faced criticism. [^9]
- **Racial Remarks in South Africa**: Criticism exists for discriminatory remarks distinguishing Indians from Black Africans during his youth in South Africa. [^10]
- **Criticism of Views on Women**: Criticized for emphasizing sexual abstinence and attempting to apply it to women as well.
- **Impracticality of Opposing Partition**: Some argue that his insistence on a united India was unrealistic given the intensifying Hindu-Muslim conflict.
- **Opposition to Industrialization**: Criticized for opposing Western industrialization and emphasizing traditional handicrafts, which some say delayed India's economic development. [^11]
