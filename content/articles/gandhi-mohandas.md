## Summary

Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948) was an Indian independence movement leader and pioneer of nonviolent resistance. Widely known by the honorific "Mahatma" (Great Soul), he is revered as the Father of Indian Independence.

## Early Life

Gandhi was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, served as the diwan (prime minister) of Porbandar. [^1]

Gandhi married Kasturba at the age of 13, which was an arranged child marriage according to Indian customs at the time. In 1888, he left India to study law at University College London. [^2]

### Education and Early Career

- 1888-1891: Studied law in London, England
- 1891: Returned to India after becoming a barrister
- 1893: Moved to Durban, South Africa, working as a legal advisor for Indian merchants

## Middle Years

### South Africa Period (1893-1914)

In South Africa, Gandhi directly experienced racial discrimination against Indians. This experience became the catalyst for his political awakening. [^3]

In 1906, Gandhi initiated the 'Satyagraha' (truth-force) movement to resist discriminatory laws by the Transvaal government. This marked the beginning of nonviolent civil disobedience. [^4]

### Activities After Returning to India (1915-1947)

Upon returning to India in 1915, Gandhi joined the Indian National Congress (INC) and led the independence movement.

Major movements:

- **1919 Rowlatt Act Protest**: Resistance against laws restricting freedom of press and assembly
- **1920-1922 Non-Cooperation Movement**: Boycott of British goods and refusal of government positions
- **1930 Salt March**: A 386km march protesting British salt monopoly
- **1942 Quit India Movement**: "British, leave India"

## Later Life

Gandhi opposed the partition of India, but ultimately in 1947, India and Pakistan gained independence as separate nations. He worked to prevent Hindu-Muslim violence during the partition process. [^5]

On January 30, 1948, Gandhi was assassinated in New Delhi by Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse. His last words are said to have been "Hey Ram" (Oh God). [^6]

## Positive Perspectives

- **Symbol of Nonviolent Resistance**: Gandhi's Satyagraha philosophy influenced civil rights movements worldwide. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela, and others drew from his methodology. [^7]
- **Father of Indian Independence**: Recognized as the key leader who guided India to independence from British colonial rule.
- **Advocate for Religious Harmony**: Dedicated himself to reconciliation between Hindus and Muslims.
- **Practitioner of Simple Living**: Inspired many through his practice of frugality and self-sufficiency.
- **Nobel Peace Prize Nominee**: Nominated five times for the Nobel Peace Prize but never received it. In 1948, the Nobel Committee mourned his death and did not award the Peace Prize that year. [^8]

## Negative Perspectives

- **Early Position on Caste System**: Initially made statements accepting the caste system, and although he later changed his position, he faced criticism. [^9]
- **Racial Remarks in South Africa**: Criticism exists for discriminatory remarks distinguishing Indians from Black Africans during his youth in South Africa. [^10]
- **Criticism of Views on Women**: Criticized for emphasizing sexual abstinence and attempting to apply it to women as well.
- **Impracticality of Opposing Partition**: Some argue that his insistence on a united India was unrealistic given the intensifying Hindu-Muslim conflict.
- **Opposition to Industrialization**: Criticized for opposing Western industrialization and emphasizing traditional handicrafts, which some say delayed India's economic development. [^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Perspectives

#### Scholarly Praise

Academic historians consistently rank Mohandas Gandhi among history's most influential figures for his development of nonviolent resistance as a political philosophy and practical strategy. His concept of Satyagraha—from Sanskrit "satya" (truth) and "agraha" (persistence), often translated as "truth-force"—revolutionized political activism by demonstrating that organized nonviolent resistance could challenge imperial power [^12]. Scholars credit his leadership of the Indian independence movement with providing a model that influenced civil rights and liberation movements worldwide [^13]. His integration of spiritual principles with political action created a distinctive approach that combined personal transformation with social change [^14].

#### Indian National Memory

Within Indian national memory, Gandhi occupies a position of unparalleled reverence as the "Father of the Nation" (Rashtrapita). His birthday, October 2, is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday in India and designated by the United Nations as the International Day of Non-Violence [^15]. His image appears on Indian currency, and his face is one of the most recognizable symbols of modern India. The Salt March (Dandi March) of 1930, when he led followers 240 miles to the sea to make salt in defiance of British monopoly, remains a defining moment of Indian nationalism [^16].

#### International Recognition

Gandhi's influence extends far beyond India. Time magazine named him one of the three most important "Persons of the Century," alongside Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill [^17]. Martin Luther King Jr. explicitly credited Gandhi's philosophy as the foundation for the American civil rights movement, visiting India in 1959 to study his methods. Nelson Mandela cited Gandhi's influence on his approach to dismantling apartheid [^18]. His principles have been adapted by movements from the American South to South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Philippines' People Power Revolution [^19].

### Negative Perspectives

#### Academic Criticism

Contemporary scholarship increasingly examines problematic aspects of Gandhi's views and conduct, particularly during his 21 years in South Africa (1893-1914). Critics document that Gandhi used derogatory language to describe Black Africans, including the term "kaffirs" in his writings [^20]. He frequently argued that Indians should be treated separately from and more respectfully than Black Africans, claiming shared "Indo-Aryan" heritage with Europeans. Some scholars contend Gandhi sought to reconfigure racial hierarchies for Indian benefit rather than challenging racism itself [^21].

#### Victim Groups' Perspectives

African perspectives on Gandhi have become increasingly critical. The "Gandhi Must Fall" campaign led to the removal of a Gandhi statue at the University of Ghana in 2018, following complaints from faculty and students about his documented racist remarks toward Black Africans [^22]. Dalit (formerly "untouchable") scholars have critiqued Gandhi's approach to caste, arguing that while he opposed untouchability, he defended the varna system (traditional caste categories) and opposed separate electorates for Dalits, famously fasting against the 1932 Poona Pact [^23]. B.R. Ambedkar, the Dalit leader and architect of India's constitution, engaged in sharp public disagreements with Gandhi over these issues [^24].

#### Contemporary Reassessment

Modern reassessment acknowledges complexity in Gandhi's views. Defenders argue that his racial attitudes evolved significantly over time—by 1908, he was arguing for African equality with Europeans [^25]. Nelson Mandela himself noted that Gandhi should be judged "in the context of the time and circumstance," acknowledging the "young Gandhi" was still developing [^26]. Scholar Bikhu Parekh views Gandhi as an "example of intercultural experimentation" whose approach to racial equality stemmed from ethical principles opposing doctrines of superiority [^27].

## Legacy and Cultural Impact

### Political Legacy

Gandhi's political legacy centers on demonstrating that nonviolent resistance could successfully challenge imperial power. His methods—civil disobedience, non-cooperation, strikes, boycotts, and public fasting—have become standard tools of social movements worldwide [^28]. The Indian independence movement he led achieved its goal in 1947, though the accompanying partition violence, which killed approximately one million people, represented a profound failure of his vision of Hindu-Muslim unity [^29].

### Cultural Representations

Gandhi has been portrayed extensively in film and literature. Richard Attenborough's 1982 film "Gandhi," starring Ben Kingsley, won eight Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor, introducing his story to global audiences [^30]. His autobiography "The Story of My Experiments with Truth" remains widely read. Biographies by Louis Fischer, Judith Brown, and Ramachandra Guha have shaped scholarly and popular understanding [^31].

### Monuments and Memorials

Statues of Gandhi exist in major cities worldwide, including London (Parliament Square), Washington D.C., and New York's Union Square [^32]. The Raj Ghat in Delhi, where he was cremated, is a major memorial site visited by foreign dignitaries and Indian citizens alike. However, his monuments have become sites of controversy, with statues removed in Ghana (2018) reflecting ongoing reassessment of his legacy [^33].

## Comparative Analysis

### Comparison with Contemporaries

**Gandhi vs. Churchill**: The antagonism between Gandhi and Churchill was profound. Churchill famously called Gandhi a "seditious Middle Temple lawyer" and opposed Indian independence throughout his career. Gandhi maintained nonviolent resistance against Churchill's wartime government during the Quit India Movement (1942), leading to his imprisonment [^34].

**Gandhi vs. Ambedkar**: B.R. Ambedkar, the principal architect of India's constitution, was Gandhi's most significant Indian critic. Their disagreement over separate electorates for Dalits culminated in Gandhi's fast unto death against the provision in 1932, forcing Ambedkar to accept the Poona Pact compromise [^35].

### Historical Parallels

Gandhi's philosophy directly influenced subsequent leaders of nonviolent movements. Martin Luther King Jr. explicitly adopted Gandhian principles for the American civil rights movement. Nelson Mandela initially favored nonviolent resistance before conditions led him toward armed struggle, later returning to negotiation and reconciliation [^36].
