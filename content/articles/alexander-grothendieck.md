## Summary

Alexander Grothendieck was a German-born French mathematician who revolutionized algebraic geometry and is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century. He reformulated algebraic geometry using scheme theory and topos theory, creating entirely new mathematical frameworks. He received the Fields Medal in 1966. In 1970, he abruptly left academic mathematics and became a recluse for the last decades of his life.
