## Summary

Nurhaci (1559-1626) was a Jurchen chieftain who unified the Jurchen tribes and founded what would become the Qing dynasty of China. Rising from relative obscurity, he transformed a fragmented tribal society into a powerful military state that would eventually conquer all of China. Through innovative military organization, strategic diplomacy, and ruthless conquest, Nurhaci established the Later Jin dynasty in 1616 and created the Eight Banners system that became the foundation of Qing military power. His legacy as the founder of China's last imperial dynasty remains deeply controversial, viewed by some as a brilliant unifier and by others as a brutal conqueror who initiated centuries of Manchu domination over China.

## Early Life and Background

Nurhaci was born on February 21, 1559, in Hetuala (present-day Xinbin County, Liaoning Province) into the Aisin Gioro clan of the Jianzhou Jurchens.[^1] His grandfather Giocangga and father Taksi were minor chieftains who served as vassals to the Ming dynasty, which ruled China at the time. The Jurchens were a Tungusic people who inhabited the forests and mountains of Manchuria, living in loosely organized tribes that frequently fought among themselves and served as both allies and enemies of the Ming Empire.[^2]

Nurhaci's early life was marked by tragedy and hardship. In 1582, when he was 23 years old, both his grandfather and father were killed during a Ming military campaign against a rival Jurchen leader named Nikan Wailan. The Ming forces, along with their Jurchen allies, accidentally killed Giocangga and Taksi during the siege of Gure fortress.[^3] This traumatic event profoundly shaped Nurhaci's worldview and his eventual relationship with the Ming dynasty. The Ming government attempted to compensate Nurhaci with honorary titles and trade privileges, but he never forgot this perceived injustice.[^4]

Despite his loss, Nurhaci received some formal education and learned to read both Jurchen and Chinese. He was exposed to Chinese culture and military strategy through his interactions with Ming officials and merchants. As a young man, he worked as a trader, traveling to Ming border towns where he exchanged Jurchen goods like ginseng, furs, and pearls for Chinese products. This commercial activity gave him valuable knowledge of Chinese society and helped him build a network of contacts that would prove useful in his later military campaigns.[^5]

Nurhaci also spent time in the household of Li Chengliang, the powerful Ming general who commanded the Liaodong region. This experience gave him intimate knowledge of Ming military organization and weaknesses. Some historians suggest he may have even served as a soldier under Li Chengliang, though this remains debated.[^6] Regardless, his time among the Ming military establishment provided him with crucial insights that he would later exploit.

## Rise to Power

Nurhaci's rise to power began in earnest after the death of his father and grandfather in 1582. Using the compensation he received from the Ming dynasty—including the right to trade at border markets and honorary titles—he began to build his own power base.[^7] Starting with only thirteen suits of armor inherited from his ancestors, according to Qing dynasty legends, Nurhaci embarked on a campaign to unite the Jurchen tribes under his leadership.[^8]

Between 1583 and 1588, Nurhaci consolidated control over the Jianzhou Jurchens through a combination of military conquest, strategic marriages, and diplomacy. He first defeated and absorbed the tribes that had been allied with Nikan Wailan, the rival chieftain whose actions had led to his father's death. In 1586, Nurhaci finally captured and executed Nikan Wailan, avenging his family.[^9] This victory established his reputation as a formidable military leader and eliminated his most dangerous rival.

Throughout the 1590s, Nurhaci continued his expansion, conquering the Hada, Hoifa, Ula, and Yehe tribes of the Haixi Jurchens. His military success was built on several innovations. He organized his forces into the "niru" system, which grouped warriors into units of 300 men, each under a hereditary commander. These niru units would later evolve into the famous Eight Banners system.[^10] This organizational structure provided greater discipline and coordination than the traditional tribal warfare practiced by other Jurchen leaders.

Nurhaci also proved to be an astute diplomat. He maintained nominally friendly relations with the Ming dynasty throughout much of his early expansion, accepting Ming titles and presenting himself as a loyal vassal even as he built an increasingly independent power base. He skillfully exploited Ming China's factional politics and the dynasty's preoccupation with other frontier threats, particularly from the Mongols.[^11]

In 1599, Nurhaci made a crucial cultural and administrative innovation by ordering the creation of a Jurchen script adapted from the Mongolian alphabet. This "Old Manchu" writing system allowed him to establish a more sophisticated administrative apparatus and communicate more effectively across his growing domain.[^12] The development of a written language was a key step in transforming the Jurchens from a collection of tribes into a proto-state.

By 1607, Nurhaci had unified most of the Jurchen tribes under his authority. He then began to centralize his administration, moving beyond traditional tribal structures. In 1615, he established a more formal government with specialized departments for military affairs, revenue, and justice.[^13] This administrative development preceded his formal declaration of independence from Ming China.

On April 13, 1616, Nurhaci took the ultimate step in his rise to power: he declared himself Khan of the Later Jin dynasty (后金), deliberately invoking the name of the Jurchen Jin dynasty that had ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234.[^14] This declaration was an open challenge to Ming authority and marked the transformation from tribal confederation to imperial state. He adopted the era name "Tianming" (天命, "Mandate of Heaven"), claiming the celestial mandate to rule that was traditionally reserved for Chinese emperors.[^15]

## Major Achievements

Nurhaci's most significant achievement was the creation of the Eight Banners system (八旗制度), a socio-military organization that became the foundation of Qing dynasty power for over two centuries.[^16] Initially established in 1601 with four banners (yellow, white, red, and blue), the system expanded to eight banners by 1615 when four additional "bordered" banners were added. The Eight Banners organized not just military forces but entire communities, including families, land, and resources. Every Jurchen/Manchu male was registered under one of the eight banners, creating a highly mobilized military society where the distinction between civilian and soldier was minimal.[^17]

The Eight Banners system provided several military advantages. It created a permanent, professional military force rather than temporary tribal levies. The hereditary nature of banner membership ensured continuity and institutional knowledge. The system also facilitated the incorporation of conquered peoples—later, separate Mongol and Chinese banner systems were created, allowing non-Jurchens to be integrated into the military apparatus.[^18] This organizational innovation gave Nurhaci's forces a decisive advantage over both traditional Jurchen tribal armies and the increasingly dysfunctional Ming military.

Nurhaci's military conquests were equally impressive. Between 1618 and 1626, he launched a series of successful campaigns against the Ming dynasty. In 1618, he issued the "Seven Grievances," a formal declaration listing his complaints against the Ming government and justifying his military action.[^19] This document served as his declaration of war and demonstrated his sophisticated understanding of Chinese political culture—he framed his rebellion not as barbarian aggression but as justified resistance to Ming injustice.

His military victories were stunning. In 1619, at the Battle of Sarhu, Nurhaci's forces defeated a massive Ming army of approximately 100,000 men with a force of only about 60,000 warriors.[^20] The Ming had assembled this army from across their empire and coordinated with Korean allies, but Nurhaci's superior tactics—concentrating his forces to defeat each of the four separate Ming columns in turn—resulted in a devastating victory. The Battle of Sarhu is considered one of the most important battles in Chinese history, marking the beginning of Ming decline and Jurchen/Manchu ascendance.[^21]

Following Sarhu, Nurhaci conquered the key Ming cities of Fushun (1618), Kaiyuan (1619), Tieling (1619), and Shenyang (1621).[^22] In 1621, he captured Liaoyang, one of the most important Ming cities in Manchuria, and made it his capital. The following year, he moved his capital to Shenyang (which he renamed Mukden), which would remain the Manchu capital even after the Qing conquest of Beijing.[^23]

Nurhaci also made significant administrative and legal reforms. He established a code of laws that borrowed from both Jurchen tribal customs and Chinese legal traditions. He created government departments modeled on Chinese bureaucracy but adapted to Jurchen needs. He promoted agriculture and encouraged Chinese farmers to settle in his territories, recognizing that a stable agricultural base was necessary for sustaining his military campaigns.[^24]

His economic policies were pragmatic and effective. Nurhaci encouraged trade, both with Ming China (when relations permitted) and with Korea and Mongolia. He established government monopolies over key resources like ginseng and furs, providing revenue for his state. He also implemented a system of land distribution among his followers, rewarding loyalty while ensuring agricultural productivity.[^25]

Culturally, Nurhaci promoted the development of Jurchen/Manchu identity. While he adopted many Chinese administrative practices, he also emphasized Jurchen martial traditions and social customs. He promoted the use of the Manchu language through the script he had commissioned. He maintained traditional Jurchen practices like shamanism even while showing interest in Buddhism and Confucianism.[^26] This cultural balancing act would become a hallmark of Qing dynasty rule.

Nurhaci was also an effective diplomat, not just with the Ming but also with the Mongols and Koreans. He formed marriage alliances with various Mongol tribes, gradually bringing them into his coalition. His relationship with Korea was more complex—he alternated between military pressure and diplomatic overtures, ultimately forcing Korea into a tributary relationship that would be solidified by his successors.[^27]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Nurhaci's rise to power and his military campaigns were accompanied by extreme violence and brutality that continues to generate controversy. His conquests of rival Jurchen tribes often involved massacres of defeated enemies and the enslavement of captured populations. The incorporation of conquered groups into the Eight Banners system, while organizationally innovative, was often accomplished through force and coercion rather than voluntary submission.[^28]

His military campaigns against Ming China were particularly brutal. When Ming cities refused to surrender, Nurhaci's forces often massacred the populations after conquest. The capture of Fushun in 1618 was accompanied by extensive killing of Chinese civilians.[^29] These tactics, while common in early modern warfare, created lasting resentment among Chinese populations and complicated the later Qing dynasty's efforts to legitimize their rule over China.

Nurhaci's policies toward Chinese populations in conquered territories were harsh and discriminatory. Initially, he viewed Chinese people with suspicion and subjected them to restrictions that did not apply to Jurchens. While he recognized the economic value of Chinese farmers and craftsmen, he often treated them as a conquered and inferior population. In some cases, Chinese residents were enslaved or displaced to make room for Jurchen settlers.[^30]

A particularly controversial episode occurred in 1625 when Nurhaci became suspicious of the loyalty of Chinese residents in his territories. Following a series of defections and alleged conspiracies, he ordered severe restrictions on Chinese populations, including forced relocations and the confiscation of property. Some sources suggest this amounted to ethnic persecution, though the extent and systematization of these policies remain debated among historians.[^31]

Nurhaci's treatment of his own family members also reveals a ruthless streak. He had numerous wives and concubines, and his sons frequently competed for his favor and the succession. When he suspected disloyalty, he could be merciless even toward his own children. He imprisoned and eventually caused the death of his eldest son, Cuyen, due to suspicions about his loyalty and competence.[^32] This family conflict created instability and would contribute to succession struggles after his death.

His relationship with the Ming dynasty is also controversial. While Nurhaci justified his rebellion through the "Seven Grievances," critics argue that his complaints were largely pretexts for naked aggression. He had benefited substantially from Ming patronage in his early career, receiving titles, trade privileges, and support against his rivals. His decision to turn against the Ming can be seen as opportunistic betrayal rather than justified resistance.[^33]

Some historians criticize Nurhaci's cultural policies as promoting Jurchen/Manchu supremacy at the expense of other groups. While he adopted Chinese administrative practices when useful, he maintained a clear hierarchy that privileged Jurchens over Chinese, Mongols, and others. This ethnic stratification would become institutionalized in the Qing dynasty and contribute to tensions throughout its existence.[^34]

Nurhaci's military setback at the Battle of Ningyuan in 1626 revealed limitations in his military strategy. His forces suffered a rare defeat when they encountered Ming cannons supplied by Portuguese traders. Nurhaci was reportedly wounded in this battle, and he died several months later. Some critics argue that his military tactics, while effective against traditional Chinese armies, proved vulnerable to European military technology, a problem that would plague the Qing dynasty throughout its existence.[^35]

## Personal Life

Nurhaci's personal life was complex, shaped by the polygamous practices common among Jurchen nobility and the political necessities of building alliances through marriage. He had at least sixteen wives and consorts throughout his life, many of whom were married to him to cement political alliances with various Jurchen tribes and Mongol groups.[^36] These marriages were strategic tools of statecraft as much as personal relationships.

His primary wife was Lady Tong (Empress Xiaocigao), whom he married before his rise to power. She bore him two sons, but she died in 1603 before Nurhaci became Khan. After her death, she was posthumously honored as an empress when the Qing dynasty was established.[^37] Nurhaci's relationship with Lady Tong appears to have been based on genuine affection as well as political alliance, and her early death may have affected him deeply.

Nurhaci had sixteen sons and at least eight daughters who survived to adulthood. His sons became important figures in the Later Jin state, and several would play crucial roles in the eventual Qing conquest of China. His eighth son, Hong Taiji, would succeed him as Khan and eventually declare the founding of the Qing dynasty. However, the relationship between Nurhaci and his sons was often fraught with tension and suspicion.[^38]

The most tragic familial relationship was with his eldest son, Cuyen. Initially designated as heir apparent, Cuyen fell out of favor with Nurhaci, possibly due to policy disagreements or because of influence from one of Nurhaci's consorts who wanted her own sons to inherit power. In 1615, Nurhaci imprisoned Cuyen, and the young prince died in captivity in 1616, possibly by suicide or execution. This incident cast a shadow over Nurhaci's later years and created succession uncertainty.[^39]

Contemporary accounts describe Nurhaci as physically imposing and charismatic. He was reportedly tall for his time and possessed great physical strength and stamina, which served him well in his early military campaigns. He participated personally in many battles, showing the courage and martial prowess that Jurchen culture valued highly.[^40]

Nurhaci had a keen strategic mind and was known for his ability to analyze military and political situations. He was also reportedly a good listener who sought advice from his commanders and officials, though he ultimately made decisions autocratically. He valued competence and loyalty above birth, promoting talented individuals regardless of their background, though Jurchens generally had advantages over others.[^41]

In his personal habits, Nurhaci maintained many traditional Jurchen practices. He was an accomplished horseman and hunter, skills that were essential to Jurchen culture. He enjoyed traditional Jurchen wrestling and archery competitions. Despite his adoption of Chinese administrative practices, he generally dressed in Jurchen style and maintained Jurchen customs in his court.[^42]

Nurhaci's religious beliefs were syncretic, typical of the Jurchen people. He practiced traditional shamanism, which remained important in Jurchen culture, but he also showed interest in Tibetan Buddhism, which was influential among the Mongols. He had some exposure to Confucianism through his interactions with Chinese culture, and he appears to have respected various religious traditions while not being particularly devout in any single one.[^43]

In his later years, Nurhaci became increasingly concerned with his legacy and the succession. He did not formally designate an heir after the death of Cuyen, perhaps intentionally leaving the succession ambiguous to prevent any single son from building a rival power base. This ambiguity would lead to a succession struggle after his death, though Hong Taiji emerged victorious with the support of other princes and key military leaders.[^44]

## Legacy

Nurhaci's most enduring legacy is as the founder of the Qing dynasty, which would rule China from 1644 to 1912, making it the last imperial dynasty in Chinese history. While Nurhaci himself never ruled over China proper—that achievement would belong to his descendants—he laid the political, military, and organizational foundations that made Qing conquest possible.[^45] Without his unification of the Jurchen tribes and creation of the Later Jin state, the subsequent conquest of China by his grandson would have been impossible.

The Eight Banners system he created remained the core of Qing military and social organization for over two centuries. Even after the Qing conquest of China, when Chinese armies were incorporated into the military structure, the Eight Banners maintained a privileged position. Banner members received stipends and were subject to special laws and privileges that distinguished them from the general Chinese population. This system's longevity testifies to the sophistication of Nurhaci's organizational vision.[^46]

Nurhaci's emphasis on Manchu ethnic identity had lasting consequences for Chinese history. The Qing dynasty maintained a complex relationship with Chinese culture, simultaneously adopting Chinese imperial traditions while preserving Manchu distinctiveness. This dualism can be traced back to Nurhaci's policies, which pragmatically adopted Chinese practices when useful while maintaining Jurchen/Manchu cultural pride. The tension between sinification and Manchu identity would remain a central issue throughout Qing history.[^47]

In Manchuria, Nurhaci is remembered as the founding figure of Manchu nationalism. The city of Shenyang (Mukden), which he made his capital, preserves his palace and tomb as important historical sites. In 2004, UNESCO designated the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties as a World Heritage Site, including Nurhaci's mausoleum (Fuling Tomb) in Shenyang.[^48] These sites attract both Chinese and international tourists and serve as symbols of Manchu heritage.

Nurhaci's military innovations influenced Chinese warfare for generations. His tactical emphasis on mobility, the concentration of force, and the integration of different military traditions (Jurchen cavalry, Chinese infantry tactics, and artillery) created a template that Qing armies followed for decades. His success against numerically superior Ming forces demonstrated that organizational quality and tactical flexibility could overcome numerical disadvantages.[^49]

The administrative structures Nurhaci established evolved into the Qing governmental system. His creation of specialized departments for civil administration, while ruling through a council of princes and ministers, prefigured the later Qing system that combined Manchu military aristocracy with a Chinese-style bureaucracy. This hybrid system allowed the Qing to rule China while maintaining Manchu identity and power.[^50]

Nurhaci's legacy in Korea is more negative. His military pressure on Korea and the subsequent invasions by his son Hong Taiji forced Korea into a subordinate relationship with the Qing dynasty, replacing Korea's traditional ties to Ming China. This is remembered as a humiliating period in Korean history, and Nurhaci is generally viewed unfavorably in Korean historical memory.[^51]

In contemporary China, Nurhaci's historical reputation has evolved with political changes. During the Ming loyalist period and much of the Qing dynasty, he was viewed with suspicion by many Han Chinese as a foreign conqueror. After the fall of the Qing in 1912, Republican Chinese historiography often portrayed him negatively as a barbarian invader. However, in the People's Republic of China, particularly after the 1980s, historians have increasingly presented Nurhaci in a more positive light as a unifier who contributed to China's multi-ethnic character.[^52]

The Qing dynasty's territorial expansion, which Nurhaci initiated, significantly shaped modern China's boundaries. The Qing conquest incorporated Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet into the Chinese empire, and these territories (with some modifications) form part of the modern People's Republic of China. In this sense, Nurhaci's conquests had geopolitical consequences that persist to the present day.[^53]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many historians, particularly those studying military history and state formation, regard Nurhaci as a brilliant military strategist and state-builder. His ability to unify the fractious Jurchen tribes into a coherent political and military force demonstrated exceptional leadership and organizational skills. Scholar Pamela Kyle Crossley argues that Nurhaci's creation of the Eight Banners system was "one of the most sophisticated military and social organizations in early modern history," comparable to other major military innovations of the period.[^54]

Chinese historians in the People's Republic, particularly since the 1980s, have increasingly emphasized Nurhaci's role as a unifier and nation-builder. This perspective, which aligns with the PRC's emphasis on China as a multi-ethnic state, portrays Nurhaci not as a foreign invader but as a leader who contributed to China's historical development. Historian Liu Jiaju has argued that Nurhaci's state-building efforts represented an important stage in the development of Chinese imperial institutions.[^55]

Some scholars praise Nurhaci's pragmatic adoption of Chinese administrative practices while maintaining Jurchen cultural identity. This cultural synthesis is seen as evidence of sophisticated statecraft rather than simple military conquest. Historian Mark C. Elliott notes that Nurhaci and his successors created a "conquest elite" that successfully ruled China by combining military prowess with administrative competence, learning from previous conquest dynasties like the Mongol Yuan.[^56]

Military historians often cite Nurhaci's tactical innovations and his victory at the Battle of Sarhu as evidence of his military genius. His ability to defeat a much larger Ming army through superior strategy and tactics is compared to other great military victories in world history. His understanding of the importance of logistics, intelligence, and morale in warfare showed a sophistication that exceeded many of his contemporaries.[^57]

Scholars of early modern state formation sometimes compare Nurhaci favorably to other contemporary empire-builders. His transformation of a tribal society into a bureaucratic state within a few decades parallels similar processes in other parts of the world during the same period. Some historians argue that his achievements should be understood in a global context of early modern state-building rather than judged solely by Chinese standards.[^58]

Defenders of Nurhaci's legacy also point out that his military campaigns, while brutal, were not exceptional by the standards of early modern warfare. The violence of his conquests was typical of the period, and he showed greater organizational ability and strategic vision than most of his contemporaries. His ultimate goal of creating a stable state, rather than mere plunder, distinguished him from many other military leaders of his era.[^59]

### Negative Views

Critics of Nurhaci, particularly traditional Chinese historians and Han nationalist writers, view him primarily as a foreign invader who initiated the conquest of China by non-Chinese rulers. This perspective emphasizes the suffering caused by his military campaigns and the ethnic divisions his policies created. Traditional Ming loyalist historians portrayed him as a rebellious barbarian who violated the natural order by challenging Chinese imperial authority.[^60]

Some historians criticize Nurhaci's military campaigns as unnecessarily brutal and destructive. The massacres that accompanied his conquests of Ming cities, the enslavement of Chinese populations, and the harsh treatment of defeated enemies are seen as evidence of cruelty rather than military necessity. Historian Guan Zhi has argued that Nurhaci's military success came at an enormous human cost that is often minimized in more favorable assessments.[^61]

Critics also point to Nurhaci's ethnic policies as laying the groundwork for the Qing dynasty's institutionalized discrimination against Han Chinese. The privileges granted to Manchus under the Eight Banners system, the restrictions on Chinese populations in Manchuria, and the ethnic hierarchy that characterized early Qing rule all originated with Nurhaci's policies. Some scholars argue that these policies created lasting ethnic tensions that contributed to the Qing dynasty's eventual collapse.[^62]

Korean historians generally take a negative view of Nurhaci, seeing him as an aggressive expansionist whose military pressure on Korea led to the devastating Manchu invasions of Korea in 1627 and 1636-1637. These invasions, initiated by Nurhaci and continued by his son, resulted in enormous suffering for the Korean people and forced Korea into a subordinate position that contradicted Korea's traditional self-understanding as a civilized state.[^63]

Some scholars criticize the historiographical treatment of Nurhaci in the People's Republic of China as politically motivated. They argue that the positive reassessment of Nurhaci serves contemporary political goals of emphasizing Chinese multi-ethnicity and territorial integrity rather than being based on objective historical analysis. This perspective suggests that Nurhaci's brutality and the conquest nature of his state-building are downplayed for political reasons.[^64]

Critics also point out that Nurhaci's Later Jin state was fundamentally parasitic on Chinese civilization, adopting Chinese administrative practices, economic systems, and political legitimacy while maintaining military dominance through non-Chinese warrior traditions. This perspective sees his state-building not as creative synthesis but as opportunistic exploitation of Chinese civilization by a militarized tribal society.[^65]

Feminist historians and scholars of gender have criticized Nurhaci's use of women as political tools through strategic marriages and his maintenance of a large harem. While polygamy was common among elites of his time, the systematic use of marriage alliances and the subordinate position of women in his court reflected and reinforced patriarchal structures. His treatment of his wives and daughters as diplomatic assets rather than autonomous individuals exemplifies the gender hierarchies of his society.[^66]

Some military historians argue that Nurhaci's military successes were due more to Ming weakness than to his own genius. The Ming dynasty in the early 17th century was plagued by factional politics, financial crisis, and military decay. Nurhaci's victories, from this perspective, were achieved against a declining power rather than representing exceptional military innovation.[^67]

## Famous Quotes

> "With thirteen suits of armor, I raised an army to avenge my father and grandfather."

This legendary statement, recorded in Qing dynasty histories, encapsulates Nurhaci's narrative of his rise from humble beginnings to found a dynasty. While the literal truth of starting with only thirteen armors is debated, the quote represents his self-portrayal as someone who achieved greatness through determination and military prowess.[^68]

> "I gathered the scattered tribes like picking up pearls, and strung them together into a necklace."

This metaphor, attributed to Nurhaci in various historical sources, describes his unification of the Jurchen tribes. It emphasizes his role as a unifier who brought order to chaos and created something valuable from disparate elements.[^69]

> "Heaven has abandoned the Ming. I have received the Mandate to rule."

From the proclamation declaring the Later Jin dynasty in 1616, this statement invoked the traditional Chinese concept of the Mandate of Heaven to legitimize his challenge to Ming authority. It demonstrated Nurhaci's sophisticated understanding of Chinese political philosophy and his claim to imperial legitimacy.[^70]

> "The Ming killed my father and grandfather without cause. This grievance can never be forgotten."

This statement, central to the "Seven Grievances" document of 1618, justified Nurhaci's war against the Ming dynasty. It framed his military campaigns as righteous vengeance rather than aggressive conquest, appealing to traditional values of filial piety and justice.[^71]

> "In battle, concentration of force is the key to victory. Attack with all your strength at one point, and the enemy will crumble."

This tactical principle, attributed to Nurhaci in military records, summarizes his approach to warfare that led to victory at Sarhu and other battles. It reflects his understanding that disciplined concentration of forces could overcome numerical disadvantages.[^72]
