## Summary

The Belgian UFO wave (1989-1990) is one of the most rigorously documented mass sighting events in history. Over a period of five months, approximately 13,500 people claimed to witness large, silent, triangular flying objects with bright lights at each corner and a central amber light. 

What sets this case apart is the transparency and involvement of the Belgian military. Unlike other governments that often debunk or ignore sightings, the Belgian Air Force openly investigated the phenomena, famously scrambling F-16 fighter jets to intercept the objects. The pilots obtained "lock-on" with their onboard radar, recording data that showed the object performing maneuvers impossible for known aircraft (e.g., accelerating from 150 mph to 1,000 mph instantly).[^1]

## The Sightings

### Initial Wave (November 1989)
The wave began on the evening of November 29, 1989. Two Gendarmerie (police) officers, Heinrich Nicoll and Hubert von Montigny, witnessed a massive triangular craft with three headlights and a central red beacon hovering silently over Eupen. They followed it.
*   **Corroboration:** On that same night, 30 different groups of witnesses and three separate groups of police officers reported seeing the same object in the region.
*   **Description:** A dark, equilateral triangle (estimated 30-50 meters wide), flying unusually low and slow, making a faint humming sound or no sound at all.[^2]

### The Peak (March 30-31, 1990)
The most intense activity occurred on the night of March 30, 1990.
*   **The Scramble:** Following reports from police and civilians, the Belgian Air Force scrambled two F-16 fighters from Beauvechain Air Base.
*   **Radar Lock:** The pilots, Captain Yves Meures and other personnel, tracked the targets on radar. The objects broke the lock by accelerating from 280 kph to 1,700 kph in seconds while descending from 3,000 meters to near ground level. Such a maneuver would create G-forces (approx. 40G) fatal to humans and destructive to any known airframe.
*   **Ground Witness:** Approximately 2,600 written statements were collected from civilians who witnessed the lights that night.[^3]

## The Petit-Rechain Photo

For 20 years, a photograph taken in **Petit-Rechain** in April 1990 was considered the definitive image of the Belgian Triangle. It showed a clear triangular outline with lights at the corners.
*   **The NASA Analysis:** The photo was so compelling that scientists and even NASA experts analyzed it, suggesting it could be a real propulsion technology.
*   **The Hoax Revealed:** In 2011, a man named **Patrick Maréchal** confessed to a Belgian TV station that he had faked the photo using a piece of Styrofoam, paint, and flashlights. He claimed he did it to "trick" his workplace colleagues.
*   **Impact:** While the photo was proven fake, investigating officers (like Colonel De Brouwer) maintained that the photo's invalidity did not disprove the thousands of other sightings and radar data.[^4]

## The Military Investigation

The public face of the investigation was **Colonel Wilfried De Brouwer** (later Major General), Chief of Operations of the Belgian Air Staff. His candidness was unprecedented.
*   **The Pentagon Connection:** De Brouwer stated there were no US stealth aircraft (like the F-117A) operating in the area. The US government denied any involvement.
*   **The Conclusion:** At a press conference, De Brouwer presented the radar tapes and concluded that the Air Force could not identify the nature of the phenomenon, but confirmed that "something" successfully evaded the F-16s with technology superior to human capabilities.[^5]

> "The day will come undoubtedly when the phenomenon will be observed with technological means of detection and collection that won't leave a single doubt about its origin..." — *Colonel De Brouwer*

## Theories

### Secret Military Projects
Skeptics suggest the objects were secret US aircraft, such as the rumored **TR-3B Black Manta** or prototype stealth blimps, being tested over friendly NATO airspace.
*   **Counter-argument:** Testing secret assets over densely populated areas at low altitude is highly risky and contrary to standard protocol. The aggressive maneuvers (40G turns) also defy aerodynamic laws for fixed-wing aircraft.[^6]

### Mass Hysteria
Social psychologists argue the wave was a social phenomenon where people misinterpreted ordinary lights (stars, planets, planes) due to media hype.
*   **Counter-argument:** This does not explain the radar data from the F-16s or the simultaneous police reports from different locations.[^7]
