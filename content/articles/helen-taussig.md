## Summary

Helen Taussig founded the field of pediatric cardiology and conceived the Blalock-Taussig shunt, a surgical procedure that saved the lives of thousands of 'blue babies' born with heart defects. Despite being partially deaf, she used her hands to feel heart rhythms in children. She also played a key role in alerting the US to the dangers of thalidomide.
