## Summary

Idries Shah was an Afghan-British author and Sufi teacher who introduced Sufi ideas to the Western world through over 35 books. His retelling of Nasruddin teaching stories and his compilations of Sufi wisdom reached a wide audience. He argued that Sufism was not merely Islamic mysticism but a universal form of human understanding predating Islam. His works, including The Sufis and Tales of the Dervishes, influenced Robert Graves, Doris Lessing, and many others.
