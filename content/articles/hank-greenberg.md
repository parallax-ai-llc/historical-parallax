## Summary

Maurice 'Hank' Greenberg built American International Group (AIG) into the world's largest insurance company during his 38-year tenure as CEO. He transformed AIG from a modest insurer into a global financial services colossus operating in over 130 countries. He was forced out in 2005 amid an accounting scandal. Despite AIG's near-collapse during the 2008 financial crisis after his departure, he remains one of the most influential figures in insurance history.
