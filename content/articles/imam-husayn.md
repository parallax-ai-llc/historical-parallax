## Summary

Husayn ibn Ali was the grandson of Prophet Muhammad and the third Imam in Shia Islam. His refusal to accept the legitimacy of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I led to the Battle of Karbala, where he was killed along with most of his family and companions. His martyrdom became the defining event of Shia Islam and is commemorated annually during Ashura. He is venerated as a symbol of resistance against injustice.
