## Summary

Joseph Needham was a British biochemist and historian of science who is best known for his monumental multi-volume work 'Science and Civilisation in China.' This work documented China's many scientific and technological innovations and challenged the Western-centric view of science history. He posed the famous 'Needham Question' of why China fell behind the West in science despite its early lead.
