## Summary

Franz Kafka (1883-1924) was a German-language writer from Prague whose surreal, nightmarish fiction has become synonymous with 20th-century alienation and bureaucratic absurdity. His works—*The Metamorphosis*, *The Trial*, *The Castle*—depict individuals trapped in incomprehensible systems, facing arbitrary authority and inexplicable transformations. The adjective "Kafkaesque" describes situations of surreal, oppressive, illogical horror. Kafka published little during his lifetime, asked friend Max Brod to burn his manuscripts after death, but Brod disobeyed, preserving works that influenced existentialism, magical realism, and modern literature. A neurotic perfectionist who worked as insurance clerk by day, Kafka remains one of literature's most haunting voices.
