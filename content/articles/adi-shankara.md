## Summary

Adi Shankara (788-820 CE) was an Indian Vedic scholar-monk and one of the most influential philosophers in Hindu history. As the primary exponent of Advaita Vedanta philosophy, he consolidated the doctrine of non-dualism, emphasizing the ultimate unity of the individual self (Atman) with the supreme reality (Brahman). In his brief 32-year life, Shankara composed groundbreaking commentaries on the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras, established four major monasteries across India, and revitalized Hinduism during a period of Buddhist dominance. His philosophical synthesis transformed Indian spiritual thought and continues to shape contemporary Hinduism and global philosophical discourse.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Adi Shankara was born in 788 CE in Kaladi, a small village in the Chera Kingdom of present-day Kerala, India, to Brahmin parents Sivaguru and Aryamba.[^3][^4] According to hagiographical accounts, his parents had been childless for many years and prayed fervently to Lord Shiva to bless them with a child. The birth of Shankara was considered a divine gift, and his parents named him after the deity who had answered their prayers.[^5]

From his earliest years, Shankara displayed extraordinary intellectual abilities. By the age of two, he could fluently speak and write Sanskrit. At four years old, he had reportedly memorized all four Vedas—the Rig Veda, Sama Veda, Yajur Veda, and Atharva Veda—a feat that typically took scholars decades to accomplish.[^6] His prodigious memory and analytical capabilities became legendary even in his childhood.

Tragedy struck when Shankara was only seven years old—his father Sivaguru passed away, leaving his mother Aryamba to raise him alone.[^7] Despite their poverty, Aryamba ensured her son received proper education in the traditional Vedic scriptures. The young Shankara studied in the local gurukul where he mastered not only the Vedas but also the Vedanta philosophy, epics like the Ramayana and Mahabharata, and numerous Puranas, which he could recite from memory.[^8]

Even as a child, Shankara showed an intense inclination toward spiritual renunciation (sannyasa). His mother, however, disapproved of this path, hoping instead that he would marry and become a householder, continuing the family lineage.[^9] The conflict between his spiritual calling and his filial duties came to a dramatic resolution through a famous incident. According to legend, while bathing in a river with his mother at age eight, a crocodile seized Shankara's leg. Facing imminent death, he called out to his mother, requesting permission to become a sannyasin so he could die in the holy order. Aryamba, desperate to save her son, reluctantly granted permission. Miraculously, the crocodile released him, and Shankara was free to pursue his spiritual destiny.[^10]

True to his vow, the young Shankara left his home and mother, embarking on a remarkable journey of approximately 2,000 kilometers from Kerala to the banks of the River Narmada in central India.[^11] There, he sought out and found Govinda Bhagavatpada, a renowned master of Advaita philosophy and disciple of the legendary Gaudapada. Govinda accepted Shankara as his disciple and formally initiated him into sannyasa. Under Govinda's tutelage for four years, Shankara delved deeply into Gaudapadiya Karika, the Brahma Sutras, the Upanishads, and the foundational texts of Advaita Vedanta.[^12][^13]

## Rise to Prominence

After completing his studies with Govinda Bhagavatpada, Shankara's guru recognized his exceptional abilities and directed him to Varanasi (Kashi), the spiritual heart of India, to compose a commentary on the Brahma Sutras and propagate Advaita philosophy.[^14] At Varanasi, still in his early twenties, Shankara began attracting disciples and established himself as a formidable scholar and debater.

The tradition of Shastrartha—public philosophical debates attended by large audiences, scholars, and sometimes royalty—was a critical pathway to intellectual prominence in ancient India. Shankara participated in numerous such debates, systematically defeating scholars from various philosophical schools including Buddhists, Jains, followers of Mimamsa, and proponents of dualistic Vedanta.[^15][^16]

One of the most celebrated debates in Shankara's hagiographies was his encounter with Mandana Mishra, a leading scholar of the Purva Mimamsa school and a householder philosopher of great renown.[^17] According to traditional accounts, this debate lasted for seventeen days, with Mandana's own wife, the learned Ubhaya Bharati, serving as the judge. The debate covered the fundamental questions of reality, the nature of the self, the purpose of ritual action, and the path to liberation. Eventually, Mandana acknowledged Shankara's superior arguments and became his disciple, taking the monastic name Suresvara and becoming one of Shankara's most important followers.[^18]

Shankara's debates were not merely intellectual exercises but served a larger religious and cultural purpose. During the 8th century, Buddhism had gained significant influence across India, and traditional Vedic practices had declined. Shankara's philosophical victories, particularly against Buddhist scholars, helped revitalize Hindu philosophy and practice.[^19] His synthesis of Advaita philosophy incorporated responses to Buddhist arguments while firmly establishing Vedantic thought on independent foundations rooted in the Upanishads.

In his mid-twenties, Shankara undertook an extensive digvijaya (tour of conquest)—a journey across the Indian subcontinent to spread Advaita philosophy and debate with scholars of different traditions.[^20] During these travels, he visited important pilgrimage sites, established centers of learning, and composed many of his major works. His reputation grew exponentially as he defeated scholar after scholar in formal debates, earning the title "Shankaracharya" (Shankara the Teacher).

The establishment of four major monasteries (mathas) in the four corners of India represented the institutional culmination of Shankara's rise. He founded the Sringeri Sharada Peetham in the south (Karnataka), Jyotir Matha in the north (Uttarakhand), Govardhana Matha in the east (Puri, Odisha), and Kalika Matha in the west (Dwarka, Gujarat).[^21][^22] Each matha was assigned one of the four Vedas and given responsibility for preserving and transmitting specific aspects of Vedic knowledge. Shankara appointed his most accomplished disciples as the first heads of these institutions, creating a succession system that continues to this day.

## Major Achievements

### Philosophical Contributions

Shankara's most significant achievement was the systematic exposition and defense of Advaita Vedanta, the non-dualistic school of Hindu philosophy. The central thesis of Advaita (literally "non-dual") is that Brahman—the ultimate, unchanging reality—alone is real, while the phenomenal world is maya (illusion or appearance). Furthermore, the true self (Atman) of each individual is identical with Brahman, expressed in the mahavakya (great saying) "Tat Tvam Asi" (That Thou Art).[^23][^24]

While non-dualistic ideas existed before Shankara, particularly in the works of his grand-teacher Gaudapada, Shankara synthesized these concepts into a coherent philosophical system, defended them against rival schools, and grounded them firmly in the authority of the Upanishads.[^25] According to Benedict Ashley, Shankara unified two seemingly disparate philosophical doctrines in Hinduism—the concept of Atman (individual self) and Brahman (universal reality)—demonstrating their fundamental identity.[^26]

### Literary Works

Shankara's literary output was prodigious, especially considering his short lifespan. His works fall into three main categories: commentaries (bhashyas), independent treatises (prakaranas), and devotional hymns (stotras).

His most important work is the Brahmasutra Bhashya, a comprehensive commentary on the Brahma Sutras of Badarayana.[^27] This is considered the oldest surviving commentary on the Brahma Sutras and represents Shankara's most sophisticated philosophical exposition. Through careful analysis and argument, he established the Advaita interpretation of these cryptic aphorisms as authoritative.

Shankara also composed commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita and ten principal Upanishads (Isha, Kena, Katha, Prashna, Mundaka, Mandukya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Chandogya, and Brihadaranyaka).[^28] These commentaries remain foundational texts in Vedanta studies and continue to be studied by scholars and spiritual seekers worldwide.

Among his independent philosophical works, the Upadesasahasri (A Thousand Teachings) stands out as a clear exposition of Advaita principles in both prose and verse.[^29] It systematically explains the nature of Brahman, the illusory nature of the world, and the means to liberation through knowledge.

Despite his emphasis on philosophical knowledge, Shankara also composed numerous devotional hymns dedicated to various deities including Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, and others. Works like Soundarya Lahari (Wave of Beauty), Sivananda Lahari (Wave of Bliss to Shiva), and Bhaja Govindam (Sing of Govinda) demonstrate his recognition that devotional practices serve as important preparatory steps toward ultimate realization.[^30]

### Religious and Social Reforms

Shankara reorganized Hindu monasticism by establishing the Dashanami (ten names) order, creating ten divisions of sannyasins, each with specific designations and affiliations with different mathas.[^31] This organizational framework provided structure to the previously fragmented monastic community and ensured the systematic transmission of Advaita teachings.

He formulated the Shanmata system of worship, which harmonized the worship of six major deities—Shiva, Vishnu, Shakti, Ganesha, Surya (the Sun), and Kumara (Kartikeya)—demonstrating that these different forms ultimately point to the same supreme reality.[^32] This synthesis helped unify diverse devotional traditions under the umbrella of Vedantic philosophy.

Shankara standardized rituals and practices in major temples across India, providing philosophical foundations for religious observances while ensuring they pointed toward the ultimate goal of self-realization.[^33] His approach balanced the relative truth of devotional worship with the absolute truth of non-dual knowledge.

### Historical Impact

According to scholar John Koller, Shankara and his contemporaries made transformative contributions to understanding both Buddhism and ancient Vedic traditions, reforming the Vedanta tradition and making it "India's most important spiritual tradition for more than a thousand years."[^34] In his brief lifetime, Shankara fundamentally altered India's religious landscape. One historian notes that "he alone was responsible for a country that was almost entirely Buddhist again becoming almost entirely Hindu."[^35] While this statement may be hyperbolic, it reflects the magnitude of Shankara's influence in revitalizing Hindu philosophy and practice.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Accusations of Crypto-Buddhism

One of the most persistent criticisms of Shankara came from rival Vedantic schools who accused him of being a "Prachanna Bauddha" or "crypto-Buddhist"—essentially charging that his Advaita philosophy was merely Buddhism disguised in Vedantic terminology.[^36] Ramanuja, the 11th-century founder of Vishishtadvaita (qualified non-dualism), leveled this criticism against Shankara's teachings, arguing that his emphasis on the illusory nature of the world and the negation of attributes in describing ultimate reality too closely resembled Buddhist philosophy, particularly the Madhyamaka school.

Similarly, Bhaskara of the Bhedabheda Vedanta tradition, writing around 800 CE, condemned Shankara's Advaita as "this despicable broken down Mayavada that has been chanted by the Mahayana Buddhists," accusing it of undermining the ritual duties established in Vedic orthodoxy.[^37] These critics argued that Shankara's philosophy devalued the importance of devotional practices, ritual action (karma), and the personal nature of the divine.

The accusation carries weight because Shankara's philosophy does share certain structural similarities with Buddhist thought, particularly in its emphasis on transcending ordinary perception and its sophisticated analysis of consciousness and reality. However, Shankara himself vigorously defended his philosophy as rooted in the Upanishads and explicitly critiqued Buddhist positions in his commentaries, particularly their denial of a permanent self (anatman) and their epistemology.

### Epistemological Criticisms

Stcherbatsky, a prominent scholar of Buddhist philosophy, criticized Shankara in 1927 for what he saw as inconsistency: demanding logical rigor from Madhyamika Buddhists while himself relying on scriptural revelation (shruti) as a source of knowledge.[^38] However, more recent scholarship has clarified that Shankara's arguments about revelation concern "apta vacana" (testimony of reliable authorities) rather than blind faith, and that he employed logic extensively while recognizing its limitations in comprehending transcendent reality.[^39]

Shankara faced the philosophical challenge common to mystical traditions: how to use language and logic to point toward a reality that transcends conceptual thought. His critics, particularly from more theistic schools, argued that his conception of nirguna Brahman (Brahman without attributes) was essentially negative—defining ultimate reality only by what it is not rather than what it is.

### Historical Obscurity and Overshadowing

Contrary to modern assumptions about Shankara's preeminence, historians have shown that until the 10th century, he was overshadowed by his contemporary Mandana Mishra. According to scholars King and Roodurmun, "until the 10th century Sankara was overshadowed by his older contemporary Maṇḍana Miśhra who was considered to be the most important representative of Vedanta."[^40] This suggests that Shankara's elevation to paramount status occurred gradually through the work of his successors and later tradition.

Furthermore, there is no mention of Shankara in concurrent Hindu, Buddhist, or Jain sources until the 11th century, raising questions about the historical accuracy of traditional accounts of his life and debates.[^41] The hagiographies that form the basis of our knowledge about Shankara were written several centuries after his death and, as scholars note, are "not historically accurate documents, but politically motivated hagiographies which abound in legends and improbable events."[^42]

### Dating Controversies

The dates of Shankara's birth and death remain highly controversial among scholars. Traditional monastery sources claim he lived in 509-477 BCE, while modern scholarship generally places him in either 700-750 CE or 788-820 CE.[^43][^44] This disparity of over 1,200 years reflects the lack of contemporary historical documentation and the reliance on later hagiographical texts with contradictory information. The controversy undermines efforts to understand Shankara's historical context and the specific intellectual debates of his era.

### Debates on Later Tradition Alignment

Scholar Paul Hacker has argued that most post-Shankara Advaita Vedanta actually deviates from Shankara's original teachings, and that only his student Suresvara accurately represents Shankara's philosophy.[^45] This suggests that what is commonly understood as "Shankara's Advaita" may actually be later developments attributed to him. The possibility that the institutional tradition bearing his name may have evolved away from his original teachings complicates assessment of his actual philosophical positions.

### Social and Caste Questions

While Shankara is celebrated for his philosophical contributions, some modern scholars have raised questions about his positions on caste and social hierarchy. The traditional accounts suggest he accepted the varna system and brahmanical ritual orthodoxy, though he taught that such distinctions disappear in the light of ultimate knowledge. Critics argue this represents an uncomfortable compromise between radical non-dualistic philosophy and conservative social structures.

---

## Personal Life

Despite his immense historical significance, reliable details about Shankara's personal life are remarkably scarce. The hagiographies provide numerous stories, but their historical accuracy is questionable, as they were written centuries after his death and blend historical elements with legendary material.[^46]

### Family Relationships

Shankara's relationship with his mother Aryamba is a central theme in traditional accounts. After gaining her reluctant permission to become a sannyasin through the crocodile incident, Shankara left home at age eight.[^47] According to hagiographical accounts, he promised his mother that he would return to perform her last rites, a promise that conflicted with the traditional prohibition against sannyasins participating in funeral ceremonies.

True to his word, when Aryamba was on her deathbed, Shankara is said to have returned to Kaladi. Finding no one willing to help him cremate his mother due to his status as a renunciate, he performed the cremation himself in the family courtyard, breaking conventional norms.[^48] This story illustrates the tension between his role as a renunciate and his filial devotion, portraying him as someone who honored both dharmic obligations even when they appeared contradictory.

### Relationship with Gurus and Disciples

Shankara's relationship with his guru Govinda Bhagavatpada was formative. Traditional accounts describe Govinda as a renunciate who lived in a cave on the banks of the Narmada River, absorbed in meditation.[^49] When the young Shankara arrived, Govinda recognized his exceptional capabilities and accepted him as a disciple. The transmission of teachings from Gaudapada (whom Shankara never met) through Govinda to Shankara represents a crucial lineage in Advaita philosophy.

Shankara, in turn, gathered several brilliant disciples who became his successors. The most prominent included Padmapada, Hastamalaka, Totaka, and Suresvara (formerly Mandana Mishra).[^50] Traditional accounts describe his disciples as remarkably devoted, and Shankara appointed them as the first heads of his four mathas, ensuring the continuation of his teachings.

### Personality and Character

From his writings and traditional accounts, Shankara emerges as someone combining brilliant intellect with spiritual intensity. His philosophical works demonstrate rigorous logical analysis, while his devotional compositions reveal emotional depth and poetic sensibility. The story of him composing the Bhaja Govindam after encountering an elderly scholar struggling to memorize Sanskrit grammar rules shows compassion and a practical concern that people not miss the essential spiritual goal by becoming lost in intellectual pursuits.[^51]

Hagiographical accounts portray him as fearless in debates, uncompromising in his pursuit of truth, yet also capable of recognizing genuine spiritual achievement in others, regardless of their philosophical school. His willingness to debate with scholars from all traditions, including those considered heterodox, suggests intellectual openness combined with confidence in his positions.

### Lifestyle and Practices

As a sannyasin, Shankara lived a life of renunciation, wandering throughout India with minimal possessions. Traditional accounts describe him traveling on foot across the subcontinent, from Kerala in the south to Kashmir in the north, from Dwarka in the west to Puri in the east—a journey of thousands of kilometers undertaken multiple times.[^52] He typically relied on alms for sustenance, though he received patronage from kings and wealthy supporters for establishing his mathas.

Despite being a philosopher emphasizing transcendental knowledge, Shankara maintained regular spiritual practices including meditation, study of scriptures, and worship. His devotional compositions suggest genuine religious experience rather than mere philosophical abstraction.

### Death

According to most traditional accounts, Shankara attained mahasamadhi (conscious exit from the body) at the age of thirty-two at Kedarnath in the Himalayas.[^53] Some traditions place his final days at other locations, and the exact circumstances remain uncertain. The brevity of his life—approximately 32 years—makes his accomplishments even more remarkable, as he achieved in three decades what might ordinarily require several lifetimes.

## Legacy

### Institutional Legacy

The four mathas established by Shankara continue to function more than twelve centuries later, serving as major centers of Vedantic learning and Hindu spiritual authority.[^54] The heads of these institutions, known as Shankaracharyas, are regarded as among the most authoritative religious leaders in Hinduism. The Dashanami monastic order he organized remains one of the primary systems of Hindu renunciation.[^55]

These institutions have preserved, transmitted, and developed Advaita philosophy across generations, creating an unbroken lineage of teachers and students. The mathas also serve important social and religious functions, providing guidance on religious matters, supporting educational institutions, and maintaining temples and pilgrimage sites.

### Philosophical Legacy

Shankara's interpretation of Vedanta became the dominant philosophical school in Hindu thought, profoundly shaping intellectual discourse for over a millennium. As one scholar notes, "The Advaita Vedanta school founded by him has always been preeminent in the learned circles of India."[^56] His commentaries on the Prasthanatrayi (the three foundational texts: Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, and Brahma Sutras) established the methodological framework for subsequent Vedantic scholarship.

Even philosophers who disagreed with Shankara's non-dualism—including Ramanuja, Madhva, Nimbarka, and Vallabha—defined their own positions in relation to his, composing their own commentaries on the same texts to offer alternative interpretations. This dialectical engagement elevated the sophistication of Vedantic philosophy as a whole.

### Religious and Cultural Impact

Shankara's synthesis helped define what came to be understood as mainstream Hinduism. His Shanmata system harmonized diverse devotional traditions, and his philosophical framework provided intellectual coherence to varied religious practices.[^57] According to scholars, in the 19th and 20th centuries, neo-Vedantins and Western Orientalists positioned Advaita Vedanta "as the connecting theological thread that united Hinduism into a single religious tradition," making Shankara "an iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture."[^58]

His role in the decline of Buddhism in India remains debated, but there is broad consensus that his philosophical victories and institutional innovations contributed to Hindu revitalization during a period when Buddhism had significant influence.[^59] By providing rigorous philosophical foundations for Vedantic thought and practical institutional structures for its transmission, Shankara helped ensure the survival and flourishing of Hindu philosophical traditions.

### Global Influence

In the modern era, Shankara's philosophy has gained international recognition. Western philosophers and scholars have engaged seriously with Advaita Vedanta, finding parallels with aspects of Western mysticism, German Idealism, and contemporary consciousness studies. Teachers in the Advaita tradition have attracted global followings, spreading Shankara's essential insights about the nature of consciousness and reality to audiences worldwide.

His emphasis on direct experiential realization rather than mere intellectual understanding or blind faith has appealed to seekers across cultural boundaries. The universality of his central teaching—that consciousness itself is the ultimate reality and that individual identity with this consciousness can be realized—transcends specific cultural or religious contexts.

### Literary and Artistic Legacy

Shankara's devotional compositions, particularly his stotras (hymns), are recited daily in temples and homes throughout India. Works like Soundarya Lahari, dedicated to the goddess, are considered masterpieces of Sanskrit devotional literature.[^60] His philosophical works continue to be studied in traditional Sanskrit schools (pathashalas) and modern universities alike.

His life has inspired numerous artistic representations, including films, plays, and literary works. The story of the philosopher-saint who revitalized Hinduism while teaching the illusory nature of worldly existence provides rich material for creative interpretation.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars and traditional commentators alike recognize Shankara as one of the most influential philosophers in Indian history. John Koller identifies him as "one of the most widely known and influential Indian philosophers from the classical period."[^61] His ability to synthesize existing philosophical strands, defend them against sophisticated critics, and create institutional structures for their preservation demonstrates a rare combination of intellectual brilliance and practical organizational ability.

Scholars credit Shankara with saving Hindu philosophy from potential eclipse during a period of Buddhist dominance. According to one assessment, "In his short lifespan, he alone was responsible for a country that was almost entirely Buddhist again becoming almost entirely Hindu."[^62] While this overstates the case, it reflects recognition of his transformative impact.

His philosophical contributions are praised for their rigor and coherence. Paul Deussen, the German Indologist, considered Shankara's system one of the most sophisticated philosophical achievements in human history, comparing it favorably with the best of Western philosophy. Shankara's careful logical argumentation, his skill in textual interpretation, and his ability to construct systematic philosophy from ancient sources demonstrate exceptional intellectual capabilities.

Traditional Hindu scholars revere Shankara not merely as a philosopher but as a spiritual master who attained the highest realization and then taught others the path to liberation. The title "Jagadguru" (teacher of the world) reflects the traditional view that his teachings have universal significance. His dual emphasis on knowledge (jnana) and devotion (bhakti), though philosophically subordinating the latter to the former, is seen as providing a complete spiritual path suitable for seekers at different levels.

His impact on making philosophical wisdom accessible is widely praised. Despite the sophistication of his major commentaries, works like Bhaja Govindam and his various stotras communicate essential spiritual insights in simple, devotional language accessible to ordinary practitioners.[^63] This ability to operate at multiple levels—from the most abstract philosophical discourse to simple devotional verse—demonstrates remarkable pedagogical skill.

Admirers note that Shankara's philosophy has brought "solace, peace and illumination to countless persons in the East and the West, and has soothed the sorrows and afflictions of the most forlorn persons, and brought hope, joy, wisdom, perfection, freedom and calmness to many."[^64] This practical benefit of his teachings—their ability to provide existential comfort and direction—is considered as important as their philosophical sophistication.

### Negative Views

Critics from theistic schools within Hinduism have consistently challenged Shankara's philosophy as fundamentally incompatible with devotional religion. Ramanuja argued that Shankara's conception of attributeless Brahman (nirguna Brahman) contradicts the Upanishadic descriptions of Brahman as possessed of auspicious qualities and undermines the possibility of genuine devotional relationship with the divine.[^65] Madhva and other dualistic philosophers contended that Shankara's equation of Atman and Brahman contradicts common experience and scriptural passages that distinguish the individual soul from God.

The criticism that Shankara is a "crypto-Buddhist" reflects a substantive concern about whether his philosophy adequately preserves the distinctiveness of Vedantic thought or merely repackages Buddhist ideas in Vedantic language.[^66] Scholars have noted genuine similarities between Shankara's treatment of maya and Buddhist conceptions of emptiness (shunyata), raising questions about the originality and Vedantic authenticity of his system.

Some critics argue that Shankara's philosophy is essentially escapist, devaluing the world and ethical action by declaring them ultimately unreal. If the world is maya and only Brahman is real, critics ask, what motivation remains for ethical behavior, social justice, or compassionate action? While Shankara addresses this through his distinction between absolute (paramarthika) and relative (vyavaharika) perspectives, critics argue this solution is unsatisfying.

The historical accuracy of traditional accounts about Shankara has been seriously questioned by modern historians. The lack of contemporary references to him until the 11th century, combined with the obviously legendary character of many hagiographical stories, has led some scholars to question whether we can know anything reliable about the historical Shankara.[^67] This uncertainty extends to questions about which texts were actually composed by him, with some scholars suggesting that only the major commentaries can be confidently attributed to the historical Shankara.

Paul Hacker and other scholars have argued that later Advaita tradition significantly departed from Shankara's original teachings, creating what amounts to a different philosophical system while claiming his authority.[^68] If this is correct, then Shankara's legacy is more complex than typically assumed—he may have inspired a tradition that transformed his ideas in fundamental ways.

From a social perspective, critics note that Shankara did not challenge the caste system or brahmanical social hierarchies, despite his philosophy's implication that all distinctions are ultimately unreal. Some view this as a failure to draw out the radical social implications of non-dualism, instead accommodating a conservative social philosophy to a potentially revolutionary metaphysics.

Feminist scholars have noted the absence of women in Shankara's institutional structures and philosophical lineage, though his debate with Ubhaya Bharati (Mandana's wife) in traditional accounts at least acknowledges female intellectual capability. The question of whether Advaita philosophy in Shankara's formulation adequately addresses gender or other social hierarchies remains contested.
