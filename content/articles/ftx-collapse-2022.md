## Overview

The collapse of FTX in November 2022 was the most spectacular failure in cryptocurrency history. FTX, the world's second-largest crypto exchange valued at $32 billion just months earlier, imploded in less than a week when it was revealed that customer funds had been secretly transferred to Alameda Research, a trading firm also owned by FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). $8 billion in customer funds went missing. SBF—once celebrated as crypto's golden boy, a mega-donor to Democrats, and an effective altruist—was arrested, convicted of fraud, and sentenced to 25 years in prison. The collapse triggered crypto contagion, destroyed faith in the industry, and became a cautionary tale of hubris, deception, and regulatory failure.

## The Collapse

### CoinDesk Report (November 2)

**Bombshell:**
Leaked Alameda balance sheet showed company's assets were mostly FTT—FTX's own token. Circular, fragile.

### Binance Announcement (November 6)

**Changpeng Zhao (CZ):**
Binance CEO announced they would sell all FTT holdings ($500+ million). "Risk management."

### Bank Run (November 6-8)

**Panic:**
FTX customers withdrew $6 billion in 72 hours. FTX couldn't meet demands.

### Binance Deal Falls Through (November 9)

**Due Diligence:**
Binance briefly agreed to acquire FTX, then backed out after reviewing books.

> "The issues are beyond our ability to help." — CZ

### Bankruptcy (November 11)

**FTX Filed Chapter 11.**
SBF resigned as CEO. John Ray III (Enron liquidator) appointed.

**Ray's Assessment:**
> "Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls."

- Secret software ("backdoor") to hide fund movements

### Alameda Losses

Alameda lost billions in 2022:
- Luna/Terra collapse (May 2022)

- Covered with customer money

---

## Crypto Contagion

### Failures

**Domino Effect:**
- BlockFi bankruptcy

---

## Political/Regulatory Fallout

$40+ million to Democrats 2022 cycle (plus undisclosed Republican donations through straw donors).

Many politicians returned or donated funds.

### Congressional Action

Crypto regulation debates intensified. SEC enforcement increased.

### "Effective Altruism"

EA movement embarrassed. Philosophy of "earn to give" questioned when earnings were fraudulent.

## Recovery Efforts

### John Ray III (New CEO)

Enron, Nortel liquidator. Worked to recover assets.

### Asset Recovery

## Lessons

### Crypto Industry

- Regulation needed
- Custody matters
- Centralized exchanges risky
- "Trust" is not verification

### Broader

- Charisma is not competence
- Media failed to scrutinize
- Celebrity endorsements meaningless
- If it seems too good to be true...
