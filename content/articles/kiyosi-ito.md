## Summary

Kiyosi Itô was a Japanese mathematician who developed Itô calculus, a framework for stochastic integration and stochastic differential equations. His Itô's lemma is fundamental to mathematical finance (the Black-Scholes model depends on it), probability theory, and physics. He received the first Gauss Prize in 2006 for his revolutionary contributions.
