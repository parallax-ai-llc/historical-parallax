## Summary

Xavier Bichat is considered the father of modern histology and tissue science. Without using a microscope, he classified 21 types of human tissues and argued that diseases affect specific tissues rather than whole organs. His work in pathological anatomy laid the groundwork for modern understanding of disease at the tissue level.
