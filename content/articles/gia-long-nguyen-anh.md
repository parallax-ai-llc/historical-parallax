## Summary

Gia Long (born Nguyễn Phúc Ánh, February 8, 1762 – February 3, 1820) was the founding emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty, the last imperial dynasty of Vietnam, which ruled from 1802 until 1945.[^1] After fleeing the Tây Sơn rebellion as a 15-year-old in 1777, he spent 25 years in military campaigns supported by French military advisors and missionaries before reunifying Vietnam in 1802.[^2] He proclaimed himself emperor on June 1, 1802, taking the reign name Gia Long, and established Huế as Vietnam's new capital.[^3] His reign is remembered both for successfully unifying Vietnam after centuries of division and for instituting deeply conservative Confucian policies that would shape Vietnamese society until French colonization.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Nguyễn Phúc Ánh was born on February 8, 1762, as the son of Nguyễn Phúc Luân and Nguyen Thi Hoan in Phú Xuân (modern-day Huế, central Vietnam).[^5] His father was the designated heir of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Khoát, who ruled southern Vietnam during the period of north-south division. However, tragedy struck the family when Khoát changed the succession on his deathbed in 1765, passing the throne to Luan's younger brother Nguyễn Phúc Thuần instead.[^6] Following this political defeat, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh's father Luan was arrested and subsequently killed, leaving the young prince in a precarious political position from childhood.[^7]

Despite this early setback, Nguyễn Phúc Ánh grew up within the Nguyễn lord's court in southern Vietnam, receiving a traditional Confucian education befitting his royal status. As a nephew of the ruling Nguyễn lord, he remained part of the aristocratic elite even though the direct line of succession had been altered. This education would profoundly influence his later governance, as he became deeply committed to Confucian orthodoxy and classical Chinese political philosophy.[^8] The young prince's comfortable life was shattered in 1777 when he was just 15 years old. The Tây Sơn rebellion, a massive peasant uprising that had been gaining strength in central Vietnam, launched a devastating assault on the Nguyễn stronghold.[^9]

In 1777, the Tây Sơn forces successfully captured and executed nearly the entire Nguyễn royal family in a bloody purge designed to eliminate any potential claimants to power.[^10] Only Nguyễn Phúc Ánh managed to escape with his life, aided by the French Catholic bishop Pierre Pigneau de Behaine, who would become his most important foreign ally.[^11] This traumatic event transformed the young prince from a privileged aristocrat into a hunted fugitive, setting the stage for a 25-year struggle to reclaim his family's former territories and ultimately unite all of Vietnam under his rule.[^12]

## Rise to Power

After escaping the Tây Sơn massacre in 1777, Nguyễn Ánh was initially sheltered by Catholic priest Paul Nghi in Rạch Giá, and later fled to Hà Tiên on the southern coastal tip of Vietnam, where he reunited with Bishop Pigneau de Behaine.[^13] The two men hid in the forests and swamps of Cà Mau at Vietnam's southern extremity to avoid pursuit by Tây Sơn forces, eventually finding temporary refuge on the island of Pulau Panjang in the Gulf of Siam.[^14] These were desperate years marked by extreme hardship. After a huge storm destroyed much of the Tây Sơn navy in 1783, Nguyễn Ánh escaped to Phú Quốc Island, where his men were reduced to eating grasses and bananas to survive.[^15]

In February 1784, Nguyễn Ánh reached Bangkok, where he obtained shelter and military support from the Siamese king, who provided him with an army to accompany him back to Vietnam.[^16] This period of exile proved crucial in forging the foreign alliances that would enable his eventual victory. Bishop Pigneau de Behaine became his most dedicated supporter, traveling to France in 1787 to secure a formal treaty of alliance with King Louis XVI.[^17] The Treaty of Versailles of 1787 promised French military support in exchange for territorial concessions, including Pulo-Condore and trading rights in Tourane (Da Nang).[^18] Though the French government was unable to fulfill the treaty due to the impending French Revolution, Pigneau persisted independently, recruiting French military officers, purchasing weapons, and organizing support from French traders and adventurers.[^19]

Between 1789 and 1799, the French force mustered by Pigneau provided critical support to Nguyễn Ánh, introducing modern European military technology and training his forces in Western warfare techniques.[^20] French officers trained Nguyễn Ánh's armed forces in modern tactics, while Pigneau and other missionaries helped purchase munitions and military supplies.[^21] With these advantages, Nguyễn Ánh gradually regained control of southern Vietnam and began pushing northward against the Tây Sơn forces. After several changes of fortune in which his loyalists repeatedly gained and lost control of Saigon, he finally achieved decisive momentum in the early 1800s.[^22] With French-supplied advanced European armaments and technical equipment, Nguyễn Ánh won decisive victories over rival claimants at Huế in June 1802 and Hanoi on July 22, 1802, completing the unification of Vietnam for the first time in centuries.[^23]

## Major Achievements

On June 1, 1802, after capturing the central city of Huế, Nguyễn Ánh proclaimed himself emperor under the reign name Gia Long, founding the Nguyễn dynasty that would rule Vietnam until 1945.[^24] The origin of the name "Gia Long" has been traditionally explained as combining "Gia" from Gia Định (Saigon) and "Long" from Thăng Long (Hanoi) to symbolize the unification of northern and southern Vietnam, though modern scholars note there is no contemporary evidence supporting this etymology.[^25] Regardless of the name's origin, Gia Long's most significant achievement was the political and administrative unification of Vietnamese territories that had been divided for centuries between competing regional powers.[^26]

In 1804, Gia Long officially changed the name of his country from Đại Việt to Việt Nam, marking the first official use of the modern name "Vietnam."[^27] He established formal diplomatic relations with Qing China, sending a tributary mission to Beijing in 1803-1804 requesting investiture as the legitimate ruler.[^28] The Qing Jiaqing Emperor granted him the title of "King of Vietnam" (Việt Nam Quốc Vương) in 1804, providing international legitimacy to his rule while maintaining Vietnam's traditional tributary relationship with China.[^29] This relationship was largely ceremonial, allowing Vietnam substantial internal autonomy while acknowledging China's cultural and political supremacy in the Confucian world order.[^30]

Recognizing that Vietnam's center of population had shifted southward over preceding centuries, Gia Long moved the capital from Hanoi to Huế in central Vietnam.[^31] Beginning in 1804, he undertook massive construction projects to build an imperial capital worthy of a unified Vietnamese state. Construction of the Huế Imperial Citadel began in 1804 (or 1805 according to some sources) and continued until 1832 under his successor.[^32] The citadel was built using Vauban-style fortifications, the defensive architecture system developed by French military engineer Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban.[^33] Gia Long personally took great interest in fortification design, ordering his French advisors to travel home and bring back the latest studies on military architecture.[^34] The result was a massive complex with two-meter-thick stone walls consisting of three rings of fortifications (outer, middle, and inner) built in the Vauban style.[^35] Between 1802 and 1844, 32 new citadels with similar Vauban-influenced architecture were built throughout Vietnam.[^36]

Gia Long also implemented comprehensive administrative reforms to govern the newly unified state. He repealed the reforms enacted by the Tây Sơn and reinstated classical Confucian education and civil service systems based on Chinese models.[^37] A new legal code, the Gia Long Code (Hoàng Việt Luật Lệ), was promulgated in 1812, heavily influenced by the Qing Dynasty legal code and representing a codification of Vietnamese law that would remain in use until 1880.[^38] The emperor divided Vietnam into provinces with standardized administrative structures, creating a centralized bureaucratic system to replace the previous fragmented regional governance.[^39] These administrative foundations would structure Vietnamese governance for over a century, establishing many of the territorial and bureaucratic frameworks that persisted even through subsequent French colonial rule.[^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements in unification, Gia Long's reign attracted significant criticism both from contemporaries and later historians. His regime has been characterized as "a typical counterrevolutionary government" that "harshly suppressed any forces opposing it or the interests of the bureaucracy and the landowners."[^41] The bloody suppression of remaining Tây Sơn forces after 1802 was particularly brutal, and Gia Long earned a reputation for cruelty in dealing with defeated enemies.[^42] He systematically reversed the progressive reforms that the Tây Sơn had implemented, particularly regarding land distribution. The land reforms instituted under Tây Sơn rule, which had redistributed property more equitably, were soon lost under the restored Nguyễn dynasty, and the proportion of communal lands dwindled to less than 20 percent of the total.[^43]

One of the most controversial aspects of Gia Long's reign was his treatment of traditional Vietnamese customs, particularly regarding women's rights. The Gia Long Code swept away traditional Vietnamese laws and customs, including provisions of the earlier Hồng Đức law code that had protected the rights and status of women.[^44] The new code reinforced Confucian patriarchal values, restricting women's rights in areas such as inheritance, remarriage, and legal standing, and subjecting women to the "three obediences" (to father, husband, and son) while emphasizing female chastity and virtue.[^45] This represented a significant regression from earlier Vietnamese legal traditions that had allowed women greater property rights and social autonomy.[^46]

Religious policy under Gia Long also drew criticism, though with some complexity. While he personally tolerated Catholic missionaries out of gratitude to Pigneau de Behaine and other French supporters, he held disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of Vietnamese.[^47] Buddhism, Taoism, and indigenous religions were forbidden under his Confucianist administration, representing a major imposition on popular religious practice.[^48] Regarding Catholicism, despite his personal tolerance, a 1804 edict revealed his deep suspicion: "[Foreign Catholics] invented the doctrines of Heaven and Hell in order to stupefy the people, to make them behave as if insane. They are so impregnated with these notions that this becomes their habitual behaviour. They become corrupted, and yet they are unaware of their corruption."[^49]

Gia Long's economic policies proved particularly problematic for Vietnam's long-term development. In 1806, he imposed the "Sea Ban policy," which banned all Vietnamese overseas business and stopped Western merchants from entering Vietnam.[^50] This isolationist approach led to economic stagnation in the early 19th century and prevented Vietnam from developing the commercial relationships and technological exchanges that might have strengthened the country.[^51] He failed to take advantage of European presence to expand Vietnam's commercial relations or borrow European technological skills and equipment to further scientific progress.[^52] His deep conservatism and closed-door policy, formed from fear of Western intervention and a preference for traditional Confucian models, left Vietnam economically and technologically vulnerable.[^53] This isolation would contribute significantly to Vietnam's inability to resist French colonial encroachment later in the century.[^54]

---

## Personal Life

Gia Long had an extensive family befitting an emperor. According to historical records, he had 21 wives and concubines, though some sources suggest even larger numbers.[^55] His principal wife was posthumously given the title of Empress Thuận Thiên (also known as Thừa Thiên Cao Hoàng Hậu), and they had three sons together: Nguyễn Phúc Đảm, Nguyen Phuc Dai, and Nguyen Phuc Chan.[^56] After his conquest of Vietnam, Gia Long took as his third wife Lê Ngọc Bính, a daughter of Lê Hiển Tông, the penultimate emperor of the Lê dynasty, thereby connecting his new dynasty to the legitimacy of the previous ruling house.[^57] In total, Gia Long fathered thirteen sons and eighteen daughters with his various wives and concubines.[^58]

The succession question proved particularly significant for Vietnamese history. Gia Long's favorite was Prince Cảnh, his eldest son by Empress Thuận Thiên, who had accompanied Bishop Pigneau de Behaine to France as a child and received a European education.[^59] However, Prince Cảnh died before his father, creating a succession crisis. Gia Long was aware that Catholic clergy favored Prince Cảnh's son (his grandson) for succession because they hoped a Catholic-educated monarch would grant them special favors.[^60] Instead, Gia Long chose Prince Nguyễn Phúc Đảm (Minh Mạng), his fourth son by a favorite concubine, who was not in the direct line of succession.[^61] He selected Minh Mạng specifically because of his strong Confucian beliefs, distrust of Europeans, and rejection of Christianity—qualities that Gia Long believed would protect Vietnam's traditional culture but which would also lead to severe religious persecution and contribute to French intervention.[^62]

Gia Long's personal character was shaped profoundly by his years of exile and military struggle. Having lost his entire family to the Tây Sơn massacre and spent 25 years fighting to reclaim his inheritance, he developed a deep conservatism and suspicion of change.[^63] His relationship with Bishop Pigneau de Behaine was one of the defining personal connections of his life. Despite his ideological commitment to Confucianism and suspicion of foreign religion, Gia Long maintained genuine gratitude and respect for the French bishop who had saved his life and enabled his victory.[^64] When Pigneau died in 1799, Gia Long honored him with an elaborate funeral and had him buried with the honors of a mandarin, demonstrating the depth of their personal bond despite cultural and religious differences.[^65] Gia Long died from illness at age 57 in Huế on February 3, 1820, having ruled unified Vietnam for 18 years.[^66]

## Legacy

Gia Long's national legacy remains deeply disputed among historians and the Vietnamese people. While he unquestionably achieved the remarkable feat of reunifying Vietnam and founding a dynasty that lasted until 1945, the long-term consequences of his policies continue to generate controversy.[^67] His most enduring physical legacy is the Imperial City of Huế, which remains a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Vietnam's most important historical monuments.[^68] The tomb of Gia Long, completed in 1820 on the slopes of Thiên Thọ Mount, is the oldest and most atmospheric of the Hue royal tombs, covering approximately 28 square kilometers across 42 hills.[^69] The tomb is particularly notable for its double burial site, where Gia Long and Empress Thuận Thiên are buried side by side in parallel stone tombs of equal size, reflecting his appreciation for the wife who accompanied him through every hardship.[^70]

The institutional structures Gia Long created—the administrative divisions, the legal code, the capital at Huế, and the centralized bureaucracy—shaped Vietnamese governance for over a century.[^71] However, his deeply conservative policies arguably left Vietnam unprepared for the challenges of the modern era. His isolationist Sea Ban policy and refusal to embrace technological modernization meant that Vietnam entered the mid-19th century significantly behind Western powers in military technology and economic development.[^72] The closed-door approach, formed from fear of Western intervention, ironically made Vietnam more vulnerable to the French colonization that would follow.[^73]

Most controversial is the question of whether Gia Long's alliance with the French enabled or hastened Vietnam's eventual colonization. The 1787 Treaty of Versailles remained "one of the justifications of French forces when they demanded the remittance of Đà Nẵng in 1847," decades after Gia Long's death.[^74] Modern Vietnamese historians view his alliance with foreigners as problematical, noting that had his treaty with France become fully effective, the French would have gained Vietnamese territory much earlier.[^75] France became heavily involved in Vietnam in the 19th century under the pretext of protecting Catholic missions and ensuring trading privileges—missions that Gia Long had tolerated—eventually leading to full colonization when three provinces were formally constituted as the French colony of Cochinchina in 1864.[^76]

Gia Long's social policies also left a mixed legacy. His reversal of women's rights and imposition of strict Confucian patriarchy shaped Vietnamese society negatively for generations.[^77] Vietnamese society under the Nguyễn Dynasty "hardly progressed in the progressive direction of the times," and deep social divisions sparked major uprisings throughout the 19th century.[^78] Yet supporters note that he provided political stability after decades of warfare and created the administrative framework for a unified Vietnamese state.[^79] The Nguyễn dynasty he founded, despite its eventual fall to French colonialism, remained the symbol of Vietnamese sovereignty and the last indigenous ruling house before independence was achieved in the 20th century.[^80]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Gia Long favorably emphasize his achievement in unifying Vietnam after centuries of north-south division, noting that political unification was a prerequisite for the emergence of a modern Vietnamese national identity.[^81] Military historians acknowledge his strategic brilliance in conducting a 25-year campaign against superior forces, demonstrating remarkable persistence and tactical adaptability.[^82] His construction of the Huế Imperial City and the network of Vauban-style fortifications throughout Vietnam represented a significant architectural and engineering achievement that successfully integrated European military technology with Vietnamese aesthetic traditions.[^83]

Some historians argue that Gia Long's conservative policies should be understood within the context of early 19th-century East Asian political thought, where Confucian governance models were considered the height of civilized statecraft.[^84] From this perspective, his reinstatement of Confucian orthodoxy and legal codes represented an attempt to create political legitimacy and administrative efficiency based on the most respected governance system available in the Sinosphere.[^85] His establishment of tributary relations with Qing China is viewed by some scholars as a pragmatic diplomatic move that secured Vietnam's northern border and provided international recognition without substantially compromising Vietnamese sovereignty.[^86]

Defenders of Gia Long also note his personal integrity and loyalty, particularly his gratitude toward those who supported him during his years of exile. His honoring of Bishop Pigneau de Behaine and tolerance of Catholics, despite his ideological commitment to Confucianism, demonstrated a capacity for personal loyalty that transcended cultural boundaries.[^87] Some Vietnamese historians appreciate that he maintained Vietnam's independence and sovereignty during his reign, even if his policies inadvertently facilitated later colonization.[^88] The administrative and territorial framework he created provided the foundation for the Vietnamese state that would eventually emerge from colonialism.[^89]

### Negative Views

Critics of Gia Long argue that his reign represented a reactionary counterrevolution that reversed progressive reforms and entrenched aristocratic privilege at the expense of the peasantry.[^90] The suppression of Tây Sơn land reforms and the restoration of concentrated landholding created economic inequality and social tensions that plagued Vietnam throughout the 19th century.[^91] His reputation for cruelty in suppressing opponents and his harsh treatment of the defeated Tây Sơn supporters demonstrated authoritarian tendencies that established a pattern of political repression under the Nguyễn dynasty.[^92]

The most severe criticism focuses on how Gia Long's policies made Vietnam vulnerable to colonization. His isolationist Sea Ban policy and rejection of technological modernization left Vietnam economically stagnant and militarily weak precisely when Western imperial powers were expanding into Southeast Asia.[^93] Scholars argue that his failure to develop commercial relations, modernize the military beyond the initial French-trained forces, or pursue scientific and technological advancement created a dangerous gap between Vietnam and the colonial powers.[^94] The irony that his French alliance enabled his victory but ultimately contributed to French colonization is seen by critics as evidence of short-sighted policy-making.[^95]

Modern Vietnamese feminist historians particularly condemn the Gia Long Code's dramatic reversal of women's rights, arguing that it imposed a foreign Chinese patriarchal system that was more restrictive than traditional Vietnamese customs.[^96] The suppression of Buddhism and indigenous religious practices is viewed as cultural authoritarianism that denied the Vietnamese people their traditional spiritual expressions.[^97] Communist Vietnamese historiography has been especially critical of Gia Long, portraying him as a feudal reactionary whose policies served landlord and bureaucratic interests at the expense of the peasant majority, though this interpretation has been somewhat moderated in recent decades.[^98] Overall, negative assessments characterize Gia Long as a pivotal but deeply flawed historical figure whose personal triumph in unification was overshadowed by regressive policies that weakened Vietnam for the challenges ahead.[^99]
