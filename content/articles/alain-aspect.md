## Summary

Alain Aspect is a French physicist who shared the 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics for experiments with entangled photons, establishing the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science. His experiments in 1982 provided the most conclusive evidence that quantum entanglement is real and that nature cannot be described by local hidden variable theories.
