## Summary

Lee Ungno was a Korean painter who lived in Paris from 1958 and developed a unique fusion of East Asian ink painting with Western abstraction. His crowd paintings of tiny human figures and his calligraphic abstractions bridge Korean tradition and European modernism. He founded the Lee Ungno Museum in Daejeon.
