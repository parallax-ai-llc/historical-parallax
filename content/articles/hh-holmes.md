Herman Webster Mudgett, known as Dr. H.H. Holmes, was one of America's first serial killers. He built a 'Murder Castle' hotel in Chicago with secret rooms, gas lines, and a crematorium. He confessed to 27 murders during the 1893 World's Fair era, though only 9 were confirmed. He was hanged in 1896.
