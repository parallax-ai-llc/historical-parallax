## Summary

Walter Sutton was an American geneticist and physician who, along with Theodor Boveri, proposed the chromosomal theory of inheritance. His 1902 paper demonstrated that chromosomes segregate during meiosis in the same way as Mendel's factors (genes), providing the physical basis for Mendelian inheritance. He later became a surgeon and died young at 39.
