## Summary
Frederick West, together with wife Rosemary, committed at least 12 murders of young women between 1967 and 1987 at 25 Cromwell Street, Gloucester — the 'House of Horrors.' They sexually abused, tortured, and dismembered victims, burying them in the cellar and garden. Fred hanged himself before trial in 1995.

## Early Life
Born September 29, 1941, in Much Marcle, Herefordshire. He suffered a head injury in a motorcycle accident and claimed sexual abuse by his father. He left school at 15. He married Catherine Costello in 1962 and had two children before separating. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Fred's first murder was Anna McFall in 1967. After marrying Rosemary Letts in 1972, they abducted, tortured, raped, and murdered young women at 25 Cromwell Street. They buried most victims in the cellar or garden. Victims included their own daughter Heather in 1987. They also sexually abused their children. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Investigation began in 1992 over sexual abuse reports. In February 1994, police searching for Heather's remains found nine bodies at the property, with three more elsewhere. Fred was charged with 12 murders but hanged himself on January 1, 1995. Rosemary was convicted of 10 murders. [^3]
