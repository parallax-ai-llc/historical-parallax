## Overview

The Enron Scandal (2001) is the ultimate symbol of corporate greed and accounting fraud. Enron, an energy trading giant based in Houston, was admired as "America's Most Innovative Company" for six years running. It claimed revenues of $100 billion. But it was a house of cards. Executives used complex "mark-to-market" accounting and secret off-the-books partnerships (Special Purpose Entities) to hide massive debts and inflate profits. When the fraud unraveled, the company declared bankruptcy, its stock fell from $90 to pennies, 20,000 employees lost their jobs and pensions, and the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed.

## Key Players

### Kenneth Lay (Founder/Chairman)
The face of Enron. Politically connected (friend of George W. Bush). Claimed ignorance of day-to-day fraud.

### Jeffrey Skilling (CEO)
The architect. Intense, Darwinian. Created the culture of "guys with spikes" and aggressive accounting.
Famous quote: "I am f***ing smart."

### Andrew Fastow (CFO)
The cheat. Designed the complex web of shell companies (LJM, Raptors) to hide debt. Enriched himself personally.

## The Mechanics of Fraud

### Mark-to-Market Accounting
Enron booked *projected future profits* as current income immediately.
If a deal was signed for 10 years, they estimated 10 years of profit and booked it today. If the deal went bad, they didn't revise it.

### Special Purpose Entities (SPEs)
Fastow created shell companies (Jedi, Chewco, LJM).
Enron "sold" money-losing assets to these entities to get them off Enron's books.
**The Trick:** Enron guaranteed the entities' loans with Enron stock. Worked only as long as stock price kept rising.

### Culture of Greed
**Rank and Yank:** Performance review system. Bottom 15% fired every year. created cutthroat environment.
**California Blackouts:** Enron traders manipulated California energy market (shutting down plants) to spike prices. "Burn, baby, burn."

## The Collapse (2001)

### Sherron Watkins (The Whistleblower)
Vice President who wrote anonymous memo to Ken Lay (August 2001):
> "I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals."

### The Unraveling
**August 2001:** Skilling unexpectedly resigned. Stock began falling.
**October 2001:** Enron announced $638 million loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
**SEC Investigation:** Announced.

### Bankruptcy (December 2, 2001)
