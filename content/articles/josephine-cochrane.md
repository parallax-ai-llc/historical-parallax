## Summary

Josephine Cochrane invented the first practical automatic dishwasher in 1886 and received a patent in 1886. Frustrated that servants were chipping her fine china, she designed a machine with a wire rack and water pressure system. She displayed it at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition and founded a company that eventually became KitchenAid.
