## Overview

Amerigo Vespucci (1454–1512) holds a unique place in history: he is the only person to have two continents named after him (North and South America). A Florentine merchant, pilot, and cartographer working for the Medici bank, Vespucci was initially an outfitter for other explorers, including Christopher Columbus. However, catching the exploration bug himself, he embarked on voyages to the coast of Brazil that changed the European map forever. While Columbus went to his grave insisting he had found Asia, Vespucci was the first to intellectually grasp the truth: that this was a separate, massive landmass—a **Mundus Novus** ("New World").

## From Banker to Explorer

Vespucci was unlike other explorers who were rough men of the sea. He was an educated Renaissance man, a friend of Botticelli, and a manager for the Medici business in Seville, Spain.
He helped supply Columbus's third voyage.
In 1499, at age 45, he decided to see the world for himself. He sailed with Alonso de Ojeda to the northern coast of South America (Venezuela).
*Trivia:* Seeing houses built on stilts over the water, he named the place "Little Venice"—**Venezuela**.

## The Portuguese Voyage (1501-1502)

This is his most famous and historically significant journey. Sailing for King Manuel I of Portugal.
**The Route:**
He explored the eastern coast of Brazil, sailing far further south than any previous European.
He reached the Rio de la Plata (border of Argentina/Uruguay) and possibly Patagonia.
**The Epiphany:**
According to ancient Greek geography (Ptolemy), Asia ended near the Equator. Vespucci found himself sailing 50 degrees South (almost to the Antarctic circle).
Furthermore, he noted the massive outflow of freshwater from rivers like the Amazon.
He concluded: **"I have arrived at the antipodes."** This land was too big and extended too far south to be Asia. It was a "Fourth Part of the World."

## The Letter and The Map

Vespucci wrote colorful letters about his travels to his patron Lorenzo de' Medici.
**Sensationalism:**
He described the natives in titillating detail—their nudity, their sexual freedom, and their cannibalism ("I saw a man who had eaten 300 others").
These letters became bestsellers. They were printed and read all over Europe (unlike Columbus's dry logs).

**Martin Waldseemüller (1507):**
A German cartographer working in France was updating the world map. He read Vespucci's *Mundus Novus*.
He needed a name for this new landmass.
He wrote in the margin:
*"I see no reason why anyone should justifiably object to calling this part... America, after Amerigo, its discoverer, a man of great ability."*
He used the feminine form (America) to match Europa, Asia, and Africa.
The name was printed on his giant wall map (*Universalis Cosmographia*). The map sold 1,000 copies. The name stuck.

## The Controversy

**The Thief of Glory?**
Bartolomé de las Casas and other admirers of Columbus vilified Vespucci for centuries, calling him a liar who stole Columbus's honor.
They argued Vespucci fabricated the dates of his voyages to claim he reached the mainland before Columbus.
**Modern Verdict:**
Vespucci likely did not name the continent himself or campaign for it. Waldseemüller did it independently.
In fact, Waldseemüller later realized Columbus was the true discoverer and tried to remove "America" from future maps, labeling it "Terra Incognita" instead. But it was too late. The public had already adopted the name "America."

## Legacy

Columbus found the door; Vespucci realized it led to a new house.
Vespucci represents the transition from medieval geography to modern empirical science. He trusted his observations (stars, coastlines) over ancient texts.
