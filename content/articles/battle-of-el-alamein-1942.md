## Overview

The Second Battle of El Alamein (October 23 – November 11, 1942) marked the turning point of the war in North Africa. General Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army decisively defeated Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's *Panzerarmee Afrika* (German/Italian). Fought in the Egyptian desert just 66 miles from Alexandria, the battle prevented the Axis from seizing the Suez Canal and the oil fields of the Middle East. It was the first major land offensive won by the Western Allies against Germany. Churchill famously summed it up: *"Before Alamein we never had a victory. After Alamein, we never had a defeat."*

## The Situation

### The Terrain
The battlefield was a bottleneck.
- **North:** Mediterranean Sea.
- **South:** Qattara Depression (impassable quicksand/salt marsh).
**Result:** Rommel could not use his favorite tactic (flanking). He was forced into a head-on defense.

### The Devil's Gardens
Rommel laid **500,000 mines** in deep belts. Interspersed with "booby traps" and anti-tank guns (88mm).

### Logistics
**British:** Short supply lines (Alexandria). Overwhelming superiority in tanks (Shermans arrived from US).
**Axis:** Long supply lines (Libya). Fuel tankers constantly sunk by RAF/Navy based in Malta. Rommel was dangerously low on fuel (only 3 days' reserve).

## The Battle Phases

### 1. Operation Lightfoot (The Break-In) [Oct 23-24]
**Artillery:** 21:40 hours. 882 guns opened fire simultaneously. The ground shook.
**Infantry:** Advanced to clear minefields ("The Mite") for the tanks.
**Stall:** Minefields were deeper than expected. Tanks got stuck in traffic jams. Rommel returned and counter-attacked.

### 2. The Crumbling (The Dogfight) [Oct 25-Nov 1]
Montgomery switched tactics. Instead of a breakthrough, he engaged in attrition ("Crumbling").
He forced Rommel to use his precious fuel moving tanks north and south to plug gaps.
**Australian 9th Div:** Attacked north (coast), drawing German reserves.

### 3. Operation Supercharge (The Break-Out) [Nov 2]
Montgomery launched final hammer blow.
New Zealand Division opened a path.
Armored battle of **Tel el Aqqaqir**:
- Rommel's Panzers vs British Yeomanry.
- Massive tank duel. Axis lost 100+ tanks.
**Rommel's Report:** "The army is exhausted."
He ordered retreat.
**Hitler's Order (Nov 3):** "Victory or Death." Rommel hesitated for 24 hours (costing lives), then disobeyed and retreated.
