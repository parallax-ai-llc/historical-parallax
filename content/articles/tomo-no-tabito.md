## Summary

Ōtomo no Tabito (大伴旅人, 665–731) was a prominent Japanese court noble, military general, and poet of the Nara period who left an indelible mark on Japanese literary history. Born into the powerful Ōtomo clan with hereditary military responsibilities, Tabito rose through court ranks to become Dainagon (Great Counselor) while simultaneously establishing himself as one of the greatest poets in the Man'yōshū anthology. His most celebrated accomplishment was hosting the legendary plum blossom banquet at Dazaifu in 730, which inspired 32 poems that would later contribute to Japan's current era name, "Reiwa." As the father of Ōtomo no Yakamochi, the principal compiler of the Man'yōshū, and a leading figure in the Chikushi Kadan poetry circle, Tabito bridged Chinese literary traditions with Japanese poetic innovation, creating works that continue to resonate over thirteen centuries later.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Ōtomo no Tabito was born in 665 into one of ancient Japan's most distinguished military clans. His father was Dainagon Ōtomo no Yasumaro, and his mother was Iratsume, daughter of Kose no Hito.[^3] The Ōtomo clan claimed descent from Ameno Oshihi-no-Mikoto, who served as a guide in Tensonkorin (the descent to Earth of the grandson of the Sun Goddess), giving the family both legendary origins and considerable prestige in court society.[^4]

The Ōtomo clan held the hereditary title (kabane) of "Muraji," which was later renamed "Sukune" (third highest hereditary title) upon the institution of Yakusa no Kabane.[^5] Together with the Mononobe clan, the Ōtomo were charged with military affairs for the imperial court, though the two clans had distinct roles—the difference between them being likened to bodyguards versus the national army.[^6]

Growing up in the capital during the Asuka period's transition to the Nara period, Tabito received an education befitting his aristocratic status. He was thoroughly trained in both Japanese and Chinese literary traditions, developing proficiency in classical Chinese poetry that would later be evident in his contributions to the Kaifuso anthology.[^7] The Wen Xuan (Selections of Refined Literature) was required reading for men of culture and a required subject for government official examinations, so Tabito naturally studied these Chinese classics extensively.[^8]

His formative years coincided with the establishment of the Ritsuryō system—a Chinese-inspired legal and governmental framework that would shape Japan's political structure for centuries. This system emphasized Confucian principles of hierarchical order and meritocratic advancement through court ranks, though aristocratic lineage remained paramount.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Tabito's ascent through the court hierarchy demonstrates both his clan's influence and his personal capabilities. In 711, he received the court rank of Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade—a respectable starting position for someone of his background. His advancement was steady: by 715, he was promoted to Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade, and appointed Minister of the Center.[^10]

The year 718 marked a significant milestone when Tabito was promoted to Chūnagon (Middle Counselor), one of the great councilors of state. The following year, he received the rank of Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade.[^11] These promotions occurred during the reign of Empress Genshō and reflected the Ōtomo clan's continued political relevance despite growing Fujiwara power.

In 720, Tabito's military credentials were dramatically tested when the Hayato Rebellion erupted in southern Kyushu. The Hayato people of Ōsumi Province had killed their governor, Yako no Fuhitomaro, in response to the imperial court's aggressive implementation of the Ritsuryō system, particularly the Handen-Shūju land allocation system that conflicted with the Hayato's communal land use practices.[^12] Within a week of receiving news of the rebellion, the court appointed Ōtomo no Tabito as great general to subdue the Hayato, with Kasa no Mimuro and Kose no Mahito as his vice-generals.[^13]

The campaign proved challenging. The court gathered over ten thousand troops from various regions of Kyushu and divided them into a two-pronged attack from east and west. The Hayato gathered several thousand troops and fortified seven castles. While Tabito's forces defeated five castles within three months, they encountered unexpected difficulty at the remaining fortresses of Soonoiwaki and Himenoki.[^14] After two more months, Tabito returned to the capital, leaving his vice-generals in charge. The war continued for almost a year and a half before ending in Hayato defeat, with casualties totaling 1,400 people.[^15] Thanks to Tabito's leadership, the southern part of Kyushu came firmly under imperial control.[^16]

Following this military success, Tabito was promoted to Junior Third Rank in 721. When Emperor Shōmu ascended to the throne in 724, Tabito received another promotion to Senior Third Rank, placing him among the empire's highest-ranking officials.[^17]

## Major Achievements

### The Dazaifu Appointment and Literary Circle

Around 728, Tabito received what may have been his most consequential appointment: Governor-General of Dazaifu (Dazai no sochi), the military procuracy in northern Kyushu. He departed for this distant posting with his wife, Ōtomo no Iratsume, after his sixtieth birthday.[^18] The circumstances surrounding this transfer remain debated among historians. Some scholars argue it was a strategic demotion orchestrated by the four Fujiwara brothers—Muchimaro, Fusasaki, Umakai, and Maro—as part of their conspiracy to oust Prince Nagaya, the Minister of the Left, with whom Tabito was closely aligned.[^19] Tabito's association with Prince Nagaya, who was falsely accused of using curses and forced to commit suicide in the Conspiracy of Nagayao, made him suspect in Fujiwara eyes.[^20]

However, an alternative theory suggests Tabito was chosen precisely for his excellent skills in diplomacy and defense given the tense international situation of the time.[^21] Dazaifu served as Japan's primary diplomatic and military interface with the Korean kingdoms and Tang China, requiring someone of Tabito's experience and cultivation.

Tragedy struck shortly after Tabito's arrival in Dazaifu when his wife died.[^22] This personal loss profoundly affected him and influenced much of his subsequent poetry, including his famous sake poems that some scholars interpret as coping mechanisms for grief and isolation.[^23] While marriages among the aristocracy were often political arrangements, evidence suggests Tabito genuinely mourned his wife, compounded by his separation from the capital's familiar society.[^24]

Despite—or perhaps because of—this personal hardship, Tabito's time in Dazaifu became extraordinarily productive artistically. He formed the Chikushi Kadan (Chikushi Poetry Circle) with fellow poets Yamanoue no Okura and Sami Mansei.[^25] Yamanoue no Okura, who served as Governor of Chikuzen and was responsible to Tabito as the superior administrator, became particularly close to him. The two formed what one scholar described as "a close literary relationship that both influenced and encouraged" their work.[^26] Okura, who had traveled to Tang China as part of official missions (701-707), brought direct experience of Chinese literary culture, while Tabito's deep study of Chinese classics created fertile ground for collaboration.[^27]

The community of poets at Dazaifu, away from the capital's traditions and distractions, created a stimulating environment for literature. Almost all the poems remaining to us by Tabito, Okura, and Manzei were written during this Dazaifu period.[^28]

### The Plum Blossom Banquet

Tabito's most historically significant achievement occurred on the thirteenth day of the first lunar month in the second year of Tenpyō (730 CE). He hosted an elaborate poetry banquet at his official residence, gathering government officials under the plum trees—exotic plants introduced from China and considered a rarity in Japan at the time.[^29] Tabito is said to have suggested that "with the sky serving as a canopy and the ground as a carpet, we are sitting relaxed and close together and exchanging sake cups."[^30]

The gathering produced thirty-two poems about plum blossoms, all included in the Man'yōshū.[^31] More importantly, Tabito composed a preface to these poems in elegant Chinese-influenced prose. The preface described how "It is now the choice month of early spring, the weather is fine, the wind is soft. The plum blossom opens" and poetically noted that "the plum blossoms were as white as a powdered beauty before the mirror."[^32]

This preface would achieve unprecedented historical importance twelve centuries later. In 2019, when Japan needed to select a name for its new imperial era, officials chose "Reiwa" (令和) from Tabito's preface—marking the first time an era name was derived from Japanese literature rather than Chinese classics.[^33] The name combines rei from reigetsu (令月, "choice month") and wa from kaze odayaka (風和, "soft wind"), generally interpreted as "pursuing harmony."[^34] This selection elevated Tabito's plum blossom gathering from a provincial poetry party to a cornerstone of Japanese cultural identity, with Sakamoto Hachiman-gū shrine in Dazaifu considered the most likely venue for this historic event.[^35]

### Literary Contributions

Tabito's poetic output demonstrates remarkable versatility across both Japanese and Chinese literary traditions. Seventy-eight of his waka (Japanese-style poems) were selected for inclusion in the Man'yōshū, most written during his years as Dazai no sochi.[^36] His Chinese-style poems were included in the Kaifuso (Fond Recollections of Poetry), the oldest existing collection of Chinese poetry written by Japanese authors, compiled in 751.[^37]

Among his most celebrated works are the "Thirteen Poems Praising Sake" (Sake wo Homuru Uta Ju-san-shu, 酒を讃むる歌１３首), a set of thirteen tanka lauding rice wine.[^38] These poems showcased his Chinese education while addressing subject matter that would later be considered too mundane for refined poetry anthologies. One memorable verse translated by Ian Hideo Levy reads: "Since all who live must finally die, let's have fun while we're still alive."[^39] This sentiment, reminiscent of Taoist philosophy's embrace of natural rhythms and pleasures, reflected what contemporaries and later scholars characterized as Tabito's Taoist leanings—in contrast to his colleague Yamanoue no Okura's more Confucian emphasis on social and family responsibilities.[^40] However, this distinction appears to reflect personality differences more than strict philosophical adherence.[^41]

His famous poems also include those reminiscing about his deceased wife and recounting his pleasure trips to Matsura Beach in Kyushu, demonstrating his range from philosophical reflection to personal grief to appreciation of natural beauty.[^42]

### Administrative Success and Final Promotion

In 730, Tabito was recalled to the capital and appointed to Dainagon (Great Counselor), one of the highest positions in the imperial government, holding the court rank of Junior Second Rank.[^43] This promotion represented the pinnacle of his political career and vindication after what may have been a politically motivated exile. However, his time enjoying this elevated status would be brief.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Political Entanglements and the Fujiwara Conspiracy

Tabito's career was shadowed by the intense factional conflicts that characterized Nara period politics. The imperial court was riven by struggles among imperial family members, leading court families such as the Fujiwara, Tachibana, and Ōtomo clans, and Buddhist priests, all contending for influence through complex political scheming and occasional assassinations.[^44]

The most damaging episode involved Tabito's association with Prince Nagaya, who served as Minister of the Left and represented a powerful faction of the imperial family opposed to Fujiwara dominance. In what later became known as the Conspiracy of Nagayao, the four Fujiwara brothers fabricated charges that Prince Nagaya had used curses against the imperial family—one of the most serious accusations possible in that era. They even claimed Nagaya's curses had killed baby Prince Motoi.[^45] In 729, troops led by Fujiwara no Umakai besieged Prince Nagaya's residence. Following inquiries by Imperial Prince Toneri and others, Prince Nagaya ordered his empress Imperial Princess Kibi and his son Kashiwade no Okimi strangled to death before killing himself with poison.[^46]

Since the Shoku Nihongi (the official historical chronicle) later used the term "false accusation" regarding these charges, it became an open secret in court circles by the early Heian period that the conspiracy against Prince Nagaya had been fabricated.[^47] The four Fujiwara brothers who orchestrated this scheme all died of smallpox in 737, leading to rumors that it was divine punishment for driving the prince to suicide.[^48]

Tabito's close relationship with Prince Nagaya made him politically vulnerable. His transfer to Dazaifu in 728—just before the conspiracy reached its climax in 729—is interpreted by many scholars as a strategic exile to remove a potential ally of Nagaya from the capital during the coup.[^49] This raises questions about Tabito's political acumen and whether he should have better navigated court factions. Some historians criticize him for failing to protect his patron or perhaps for being too closely identified with a losing faction.

### The Ōtomo Clan's Declining Influence

The broader trajectory of the Ōtomo clan during this period represents a study in aristocratic decline. The Nara Period witnessed the clan's gradual marginalization as the Fujiwara systematically consolidated power. The Conspiracy of Nagayao, in which Tabito was peripherally involved, was followed by the Conspiracy of Tachibana no Naramaro, where other Ōtomo clan members suffered severely—OTOMO no Komoro was tortured to death and OTOMO no Kojihi was deported.[^50]

By the end of the Nara period, the Fujiwara clan had definitively won the competition for control of the central government and power to manipulate emperors, leaving the Ōtomo, Tachibana, and other traditional clans diminished.[^51] Tabito's generation represented perhaps the last gasp of Ōtomo political prominence at the highest levels. Critics might argue that he failed to reverse his clan's fortunes or secure its position for future generations, though such criticism may be unfair given the structural advantages the Fujiwara enjoyed through strategic marriages to imperial princesses.

### Questions About the Hayato Campaign

While Tabito's leadership during the Hayato Rebellion was ultimately successful in bringing southern Kyushu under imperial control, the campaign can be criticized from several angles. The rebellion itself arose from heavy-handed imperial policies that disregarded Hayato cultural practices, particularly their communal land use systems.[^52] Tabito, as the military commander tasked with suppression rather than negotiation, became the instrument of what modern perspectives might view as cultural imperialism.

The campaign's duration—nearly eighteen months—and the difficulty encountered at the final two fortresses suggest either strategic failures or the resilience of Hayato resistance that contemporary accounts may have understated.[^53] The reported 1,400 casualties, while modest by later historical standards, represented significant bloodshed. Tabito's return to the capital before the campaign's conclusion, leaving vice-generals to complete the work, might be interpreted as either confident delegation or abandonment of direct command at a crucial juncture.[^54]

### Literary Criticisms

From a literary standpoint, Tabito's work has received mixed assessment. While undeniably important and technically accomplished, his sake poems were excluded from later, more refined poetry anthologies precisely because they covered subject matter deemed unsuitable for elevated literary taste.[^55] This exclusion suggests that even admirers of his technical skill found aspects of his oeuvre problematic or insufficiently dignified for canonical status.

The heavy Chinese influence in Tabito's work, while impressive in its own right, can be criticized as derivative rather than innovative. His plum blossom party explicitly imitated Chinese cultural practices rather than developing distinctly Japanese aesthetic traditions.[^56] In this view, Tabito represents cultural borrowing rather than creative synthesis, though such criticism may underestimate the transformative work of adapting continental models to Japanese contexts.

## Personal Life

### Family Relationships

Tabito's family life was marked by both privilege and tragedy. His marriage to Ōtomo no Iratsume appears to have been personally meaningful despite the political nature of aristocratic unions. Her death shortly after their arrival in Dazaifu deeply affected him, inspiring grief poetry and possibly his turn toward drinking poems as a coping mechanism.[^57] While marriages among the nobility were typically arranged for political advantage, evidence from Tabito's poetry suggests genuine affection and loss.

Following his wife's death, Tabito summoned his younger half-sister, Ōtomo no Sakanoue no Iratsume (c. 695–750), to join his household in Dazaifu in 728. She was herself a major poet who would contribute 84 poems to the Man'yōshū, making her the foremost female poet in the collection and third-best represented overall regardless of gender.[^58] Scholars Donald Keene and Yutaka Tsuchihashi speculate that Tabito brought Lady Sakanoue no Iratsume to educate his son, Ōtomo no Yakamochi, though she may also have replaced Tabito's deceased wife in performing religious ceremonies for the Ōtomo clan.[^59] This arrangement demonstrates the multifaceted roles aristocratic women played in maintaining family religious and educational functions.

### Ōtomo no Yakamochi

Tabito's most enduring legacy came through his son, Ōtomo no Yakamochi (718–785), who accompanied him to Kyushu and was exposed to the literary circle his father formed in Dazaifu.[^60] Under Tabito's influence and later that of his aunt Sakanoue no Iratsume, Yakamochi developed into one of Japan's greatest poets. He contributed 478 poems to the Man'yōshū (46 nagauta and 432 tanka), comprising over ten percent of the anthology's contents.[^61]

More significantly, Yakamochi is believed to be the principal compiler—or at least the final compiler—of the Man'yōshū itself, transcribing, rewriting, and refashioning an unknown number of ancient poems and folklore into the collection that became the foundation of Japanese poetic tradition.[^62] Through this editorial work, Yakamochi ensured his father's poems would be preserved and transmitted to posterity. The Man'yōshū includes works by Tabito, Yakamochi himself, and their aunt Sakanoue no Iratsume, making it something of a family anthology.[^63]

After Tabito's death in 731, Sakanoue no Iratsume became the de facto head of the Ōtomo house, demonstrating the complex succession practices and the significant roles women could play in aristocratic clan leadership.[^64]

### Personality and Philosophical Temperament

Contemporary characterizations and Tabito's own poetry suggest a complex personality. He is often described as having Taoist inclinations—preferring the freedom of communion with nature, appreciating wine and spontaneity, and embracing life's pleasures in the face of mortality.[^65] This contrasts with his colleague Yamanoue no Okura's more Confucian focus on social duties and family responsibilities, though scholars note these differences reflect personality more than strict philosophical schools.[^66]

His decision to host elaborate cultural gatherings like the plum blossom banquet, complete with Chinese-style elegance and liberal sake consumption, reveals someone who valued aesthetic experience and literary refinement.[^67] The suggestion that guests use "the sky as a canopy and the ground as a carpet" evokes a spontaneous, naturalistic approach to celebration that aligns with Taoist ideals of harmonizing with the natural world.[^68]

Yet Tabito also fulfilled demanding administrative and military duties with apparent competence, suggesting practical discipline alongside his poetic sensibilities. This combination of cultural refinement and administrative capability characterized the ideal Nara period aristocrat.

## Legacy

### Literary Impact

Ōtomo no Tabito is recognized among the greatest poets in the Man'yōshū anthology, alongside luminaries like Kakinomoto no Hitomaro, Yamabe no Akahito, and Yamanoue no Okura.[^69] His 78 waka preserved in the collection represent a significant portion of early Japanese poetry, while his Chinese-style poems in the Kaifuso demonstrate the breadth of his literary accomplishments.[^70]

The Dazaifu poetry circle he led created an important literary community that influenced Japanese poetry's development during the Nara period.[^71] Away from the capital's established traditions, this community experimented with form, content, and the integration of Chinese and Japanese poetic conventions. The Chikushi Kadan section of the Man'yōshū preserves this remarkable creative collaboration.[^72]

### Cultural Symbolism

The selection of "Reiwa" as Japan's current era name in 2019, derived from Tabito's plum blossom banquet preface, catapulted him into contemporary cultural consciousness.[^73] This marked a watershed moment in Japanese cultural history—the first era name drawn from Japanese rather than Chinese literature, symbolizing a confident assertion of indigenous literary tradition.[^74] Every time contemporary Japanese write dates, sign documents, or mark anniversaries using the Reiwa designation, they invoke Tabito's poetic legacy.

The plum blossom gathering itself became a cultural touchstone, inspiring exhibitions, pilgrimages to Dazaifu, and renewed interest in Man'yōshū studies.[^75] Sakamoto Hachiman-gū shrine, believed to be the banquet's location, has become a site of literary pilgrimage.[^76]

### Influence on Subsequent Generations

Through his son Yakamochi's compilation of the Man'yōshū, Tabito's influence extended far beyond his own poems. The anthology Yakamochi assembled became the foundation for all subsequent Japanese poetry, establishing aesthetic standards, emotional ranges, and formal conventions that would influence waka composition for over a millennium.[^77] Without Yakamochi's editorial work—itself shaped by his father's tutelage—Japanese literary history would look dramatically different.

Tabito's model of the cultured provincial administrator, equally comfortable with military command, governmental administration, and poetic refinement, influenced ideals of aristocratic excellence. His integration of Chinese learning with Japanese expression anticipated later syntheses that would characterize Heian period court culture.

### The Ōtomo Family Legacy

Despite the Ōtomo clan's political decline, its literary legacy—secured largely through Tabito, Yakamochi, and Sakanoue no Iratsume—ensured the family's historical significance. The clan's hereditary military role gave way to cultural importance as their poetic contributions outlasted their political influence.[^78]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship generally views Tabito favorably as a major literary figure and competent administrator. His technical proficiency in poetry is undisputed—his sake poems, while excluded from later refined anthologies, demonstrate sophisticated manipulation of form and theme.[^79] The fact that they were excluded for content rather than quality actually highlights their technical excellence.

Scholars praise the Dazaifu poetry circle's importance as an innovative literary environment. The collaboration between Tabito and Yamanoue no Okura, bringing together different personalities and approaches to Chinese learning, created what one academic described as a relationship "that both influenced and encouraged" their respective works.[^80] This productive literary friendship enriched both poets' outputs and created a body of work greater than either could have produced individually.

Tabito's role in transmitting Chinese literary culture to Japan receives scholarly appreciation. His deep study of Chinese classics, particularly the Wen Xuan, and his ability to adapt Chinese poetic forms and gathering practices to Japanese contexts, facilitated cultural exchange during a crucial period of Japanese cultural formation.[^81] Rather than slavish imitation, this represents creative adaptation and synthesis.

His military success against the Hayato Rebellion, despite the campaign's moral complexities, demonstrated leadership capabilities that extended beyond literary pursuits. Bringing southern Kyushu firmly under imperial control was strategically important for the emerging Japanese state.[^82]

The plum blossom banquet is increasingly recognized as a masterpiece of cultural production—not merely as poetry composition but as a total aesthetic experience integrating natural beauty, social ritual, literary creation, and cultural performance. Tabito's vision of using "the sky as a canopy and the ground as a carpet" demonstrates sophisticated aesthetic consciousness.[^83]

Finally, his influence through his son Yakamochi receives universal scholarly recognition. By nurturing Yakamochi's poetic talents and exposing him to the Dazaifu literary circle, Tabito indirectly shaped the Man'yōshū's final form and thus all of Japanese poetry.[^84]

### Negative Views

Critical perspectives on Tabito focus on several areas. His political judgment appears questionable given his association with Prince Nagaya and apparent inability to navigate Fujiwara machinations effectively. Whether his Dazaifu posting was punishment or pragmatic appointment, it removed him from the capital during crucial political struggles, suggesting either political naivety or calculated marginalization.[^85]

Some scholars note that while Tabito was "a contemporary of Hitomaro," he "lacked his success in the Imperial Court," suggesting he failed to fully capitalize on his talents and background for political advancement.[^86] This comparison highlights the gap between literary excellence and political achievement.

The Ōtomo clan's continued decline during and after Tabito's career raises questions about his effectiveness as a clan leader. Unlike the Fujiwara, who successfully converted court positions into structural dominance, the Ōtomo could not maintain their traditional military role's relevance as political power became increasingly centered on bureaucratic positions and imperial marriage alliances.[^87]

From a modern ethical perspective, Tabito's role in suppressing the Hayato Rebellion makes him an instrument of cultural imperialism and forced assimilation. The Hayato rebelled against land policies that destroyed their traditional communal practices, and Tabito's military success meant the triumph of centralized authority over regional autonomy and indigenous customs.[^88]

Literary critics might argue that his heavy reliance on Chinese models limited genuine innovation. The plum blossom party explicitly imitated continental practices, and even his Japanese waka show strong Chinese philosophical influence. Some scholars prefer poets who developed more distinctly Japanese aesthetic sensibilities.[^89]

Finally, the personal choice to cope with grief through drinking and wine poetry, while humanly understandable and literarily productive, might be criticized as escapism rather than constructive engagement with loss. This critique, however, seems anachronistic and perhaps culturally insensitive given different Nara period attitudes toward wine and poetry.
