## Summary

Golda Meir (1898-1978) was an Israeli stateswoman, politician, and the fourth Prime Minister of Israel (1969-1974). Born in Kyiv, Ukraine, she emigrated to the United States as a child and later to British Mandate Palestine in 1921, becoming a leader in the Labor Zionist movement. Meir was a founding mother of Israel, signatory of the Declaration of Independence, and served as Labor Minister, Foreign Minister, and finally Prime Minister. Known as the "Iron Lady" of Israeli politics (before Thatcher), she led Israel during the traumatic Yom Kippur War (1973), after which she resigned. Meir remains one of the few female heads of government in history and a towering figure in Israeli history.
