## Summary
Marc Dutroux kidnapped six girls in Belgium in the mid-1990s, holding them in a dungeon. Four died. His case triggered a national crisis, the 'White March' of 300,000 citizens, and fundamental reforms in Belgium's police and justice systems. He was convicted of murder and rape in 2004.

## Early Life
Born November 6, 1956, in Ixelles, Brussels. Previously convicted of kidnapping and raping five girls in 1989 and sentenced to 13 years. Despite being deemed dangerous, he was released after just three years in 1992. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1995 and 1996, Dutroux kidnapped six girls, holding them in a basement dungeon. Two victims (ages 8) starved to death while Dutroux was briefly jailed and his wife failed to feed them. Two teenagers were murdered. Only Sabine Dardenne (12) and Laetitia Delhez (14) survived. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Arrested August 13, 1996, after witnesses noted suspicious behavior. The two surviving girls were rescued from his dungeon. Investigation revealed catastrophic police failures — officers had entered his house during the search but missed the dungeon. Convicted in 2004, sentenced to life. [^3]
