## Summary

Dharmakirti was an Indian Buddhist philosopher and logician whose works on epistemology and logic became foundational in Tibetan Buddhism and Indian philosophy. His Pramanavarttika (Commentary on Valid Cognition) is one of the most studied texts in Tibetan monastic education. He refined the logical system of his predecessor Dignaga and developed sophisticated arguments for Buddhist metaphysical positions. His work remains central to Tibetan Buddhist intellectual training.
