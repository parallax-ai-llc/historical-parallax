## Summary

Joshua Lederberg was an American molecular biologist who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering genetic recombination in bacteria (bacterial conjugation). He demonstrated that bacteria can exchange genetic material, overturning the belief that bacteria reproduce only asexually. He later coined the term 'exobiology' and advised NASA on biological contamination risks.
