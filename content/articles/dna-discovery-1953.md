## Overview

The discovery of the double helix structure of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) in 1953 is often considered the most important biological discovery of the 20th century. While DNA was known to exist, its structure and method of replication were a mystery. The solution—a twisted ladder (double helix) with complementary base pairs—was identified by James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge University. However, their breakthrough relied heavily on the crucial, unacknowledged X-ray crystallography data of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. This discovery unlocked the secret of life: how genetic information is stored and copied, launching the era of modern molecular biology.

## Background

### The Puzzle

**What is the gene?**
By 1950, scientists knew genes carried hereditary info.
**Hershey-Chase Experiment (1952):** Confirmed DNA (not protein) was the genetic material.
**Chargaff's Rules:** Erwin Chargaff found that amount of Adenine (A) = Thymine (T), and Guanine (G) = Cytosine (C).

**The Race:**
Major labs racing to solve structure:
1. **Cavendish Lab (Cambridge):** Watson & Crick
2. **King's College (London):** Franklin & Wilkins
3. **Caltech (USA):** Linus Pauling (famous chemist)

## The Key Players

### The Model Builders (Cambridge)

**James Watson:**
Young American biologist (24). Brash, intuitive.

**Francis Crick:**
British physicist-turned-biologist (36). Talkative, brilliant theoretician.

**Method:**
Couldn't do experiments themselves. Built physical models (like toys) based on others' data.

### The Experimentalists (London)

**Rosalind Franklin:**
Expert X-ray crystallographer. Meticulous, cautious. Produced best images of DNA.

**Maurice Wilkins:**
Sharing lab with Franklin (bad relationship).

### The Rival (USA)

**Linus Pauling:**
Proposed a "triple helix" model in early 1953 (incorrect—structure would have fallen apart).

## The Discovery

### Photo 51

**May 1952:**
Rosalind Franklin took "Photo 51"—an incredibly clear X-ray diffraction image of DNA. The "X" pattern clearly suggested a helix.

**The Theft?**
January 1953: Without Franklin's permission or knowledge, Maurice Wilkins showed Photo 51 to James Watson.

**Watson's Reaction:**
> "The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race."

He knew instantly it was a helix.

### Building the Model (February 1953)

Watson and Crick rushed to build a model that fit the data.

**Problem:** How do bases fit inside?
**Breakthrough (Feb 28):** Watson realized A-T and G-C pairings were identical shapes. They fit together like puzzle pieces on the inside of the ladder.

**The Secret of Life:**
This structure explained replication: Unzip the strands, and each side serves as a template to rebuild the other.

## The Announcement

### The Eagle Pub

**February 28, 1953:**
Watson and Crick walked into The Eagle pub in Cambridge. Crick famously announced:
> "We have discovered the secret of life."

### Nature Paper (April 25, 1953)

Published one page article: "Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids."

**Understatement of the Century:**
> "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material."

Franklin and Wilkins published supporting data in same issue (appearing to confirm Watson/Crick, rather than being the basis for it).

## Rosalind Franklin's Fate

**Unsung Hero:**
Franklin left King's College. Died of ovarian cancer in 1958 (age 37)—likely from X-ray exposure.

**Nobel Rules:**
Nobel Prize cannot be awarded posthumously.

---

## Nobel Prize (1962)

Awarded to:
- **James Watson**
- **Francis Crick**
- **Maurice Wilkins**

Franklin was excluded (deceased). Her contribution was minimized for decades, especially in Watson's book *The Double Helix*.

## Legacy

### Biotechnology Revolution

Understanding DNA structure led to:
- Genetic code cracking (1960s)
- Recombinant DNA / GMOs (1970s)
- DNA sequencing (Sanger)
- Human Genome Project (2003)
- CRISPR gene editing (2012)
- Forensic DNA profiling
- mRNA vaccines (COVID-19)

### Ethics

Opened Pandora's box:
- Cloning
- Designer babies
- Genetic privacy
