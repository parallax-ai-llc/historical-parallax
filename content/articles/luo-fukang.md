## Summary

Luo Fuxing (羅福星, 1886-1914) was a Taiwanese-born revolutionary and anti-Japanese resistance leader who played a pivotal role in the early Republican Chinese revolutionary movement. Born in Jakarta, Indonesia to a Hakka father and a mother of mixed Dutch-Indonesian descent, Luo joined Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui and participated in the Second Guangzhou Uprising of 1911.[^1][^2] In 1912, appointed by Sun Yat-sen, he returned to Taiwan to organize armed resistance against Japanese colonial rule, leading to the Miaoli Incident of 1913.[^3] He was executed by hanging on March 3, 1914, at age 28, becoming one of Taiwan's most celebrated anti-colonial martyrs.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Luo Fuxing was born on February 24, 1886, in Batavia, Dutch East Indies (modern-day Jakarta, Indonesia), into a unique transnational family.[^5] His father, Luo Jingbang (羅經邦), was a Hakka merchant from Guangdong's Jiaying Prefecture (now part of Meizhou City) who had emigrated to Java to conduct business.[^6] His mother was a Javanese overseas Chinese woman with Dutch and Indonesian ancestry, which gave young Luo a distinctive European-like appearance that would later serve him in his revolutionary activities.[^7]

In 1887, when Luo was approximately one year old, his parents returned with him to China, settling in Guangdong Jiaying Prefecture's Zhenping County, Gaosi Township, Dadi Village (present-day Dadi Village, Lanfang Town, Jiaoling County, Meizhou City).[^8] There, he received a traditional Chinese classical education, immersing himself in Confucian texts and Chinese cultural values despite his cosmopolitan background.[^9] This dual heritage—Southeast Asian birth combined with Chinese cultural education—would profoundly shape his identity and revolutionary consciousness.

In 1896, at age ten, Luo returned with his father to Batavia, where he attended Chinese schools while also studying the Dutch language.[^10] This multilingual education exposed him to Western ideas of nationalism, democracy, and anti-imperialism that were circulating throughout the colonial world at the turn of the twentieth century. The experience of witnessing Dutch colonialism in Indonesia likely sensitized him to issues of colonial oppression that would later motivate his resistance against Japanese rule in Taiwan.

In 1903, after graduating from middle school in Batavia, Luo traveled with his grandfather to Taiwan's Miaoli County, specifically to Niulanhu Village in Zaoqiao Township.[^11] He enrolled at Miaoli Public School, where he studied under the Japanese colonial education system until 1907.[^12] This four-year period in Taiwan gave Luo firsthand experience of Japanese colonial governance and allowed him to develop deep connections with the local Hakka community that would prove crucial to his later revolutionary organizing.

## Rise to Power

Luo Fuxing's revolutionary awakening came in 1906 during his return journey from Taiwan to Guangdong with his grandfather.[^13] While passing through Xiamen (Amoy), a major treaty port and center of anti-Qing revolutionary activity, he encountered revolutionary propaganda that profoundly inspired him to join the movement to overthrow the Qing dynasty.[^14] After returning to his ancestral hometown in Jiaying, he worked as an elementary school teacher while secretly engaging in revolutionary activities.[^15]

In 1907, Luo formally joined the Tongmenghui (同盟會), the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance founded by Sun Yat-sen in Tokyo in 1905.[^16] The Tongmenghui was dedicated to overthrowing the Qing dynasty and establishing a republican government in China based on Sun's Three Principles of the People: nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.[^17] Under the influence of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideology, Luo became a passionate advocate for Chinese nationalism and anti-imperialism.[^18]

Over the following years, Luo traveled extensively throughout Southeast Asia—including Java, Myanmar (Burma), and Singapore—where he worked as an educator while simultaneously promoting revolutionary activities among the large overseas Chinese communities.[^19] He used his teaching positions as cover for recruiting revolutionaries and raising funds for the Tongmenghui's planned uprisings against the Qing government.[^20] His multilingual abilities and mixed heritage allowed him to move relatively freely through the colonial territories of Southeast Asia.

In April 1911, Luo participated in one of the most significant revolutionary actions before the Wuchang Uprising: the Second Guangzhou Uprising, also known as the Yellow Flower Mound Revolt (黃花崗起義).[^21] Led by Huang Xing, nearly a hundred revolutionaries stormed the residence of the viceroy of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces on April 27, 1911.[^22] Although the uprising initially succeeded, Qing reinforcements heavily outnumbered the revolutionaries, and the rebellion was brutally suppressed.[^23] Of the approximately 86 revolutionaries who died, only 72 bodies could be identified and were buried together at Yellow Flower Mound, lending the uprising its name.[^24]

Luo Fuxing was among the few survivors of this disastrous battle, an experience that both traumatized and steeled his revolutionary resolve.[^25] The Yellow Flower Mound martyrs became symbols of revolutionary sacrifice, and survivors like Luo gained considerable prestige within the Tongmenghui organization. Later in 1911, Luo also participated in the Wuchang Uprising that successfully triggered the Xinhai Revolution, leading to the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China on January 1, 1912.[^26]

## Major Achievements

Following the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912, Luo Fuxing received a crucial assignment from Sun Yat-sen himself: to extend the revolution to Taiwan and liberate it from Japanese colonial occupation.[^27] Taiwan had been ceded to Japan in 1895 following China's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War, and by 1912 had been under Japanese rule for seventeen years.[^28] Many Chinese nationalists, including Sun Yat-sen, viewed Taiwan's return to Chinese sovereignty as an essential goal of the revolutionary movement.[^29]

In 1912, Luo arrived in Taiwan with the explicit mission to "propagate the revolution and arouse national consciousness" among the Taiwanese people.[^30] He established a branch of the Tongmenghui in Taipei, using the historic Dadaocheng district (大稻埕)—a center of Taiwanese merchant culture and political activism—as his base of operations.[^31] Working underground, Luo organized resistance cells, recruited supporters through various civic organizations, and arranged for weapons to be smuggled from mainland China.[^32]

Luo's organizational achievement was remarkable given the oppressive nature of Japanese colonial surveillance. He created a sophisticated network that spanned multiple regions of Taiwan, including operations in Miaoli, Nantou, Hsinchu, and Tainan.[^33] He recruited followers by appealing to both Chinese nationalist sentiment and resentment against Japanese colonial policies, including land confiscation, economic exploitation, and cultural suppression.[^34] His mixed heritage and ability to speak multiple languages may have helped him evade Japanese suspicion longer than a purely Chinese organizer might have.

The scope of Luo's planned uprising was ambitious. He aimed to mobilize approximately 500 armed fighters for simultaneous rebellions across Taiwan that would overwhelm Japanese colonial forces and inspire a general uprising of the Taiwanese population.[^35] The plan called for attacks on police stations to seize weapons, followed by coordinated assaults on major administrative centers.[^36] Luo hoped that success in Taiwan would not only liberate the island but also inspire further anti-Japanese resistance in Korea and other colonized territories.[^37]

What became known as the Miaoli Incident (苗栗事件) actually comprised five separate but coordinated uprisings that occurred between 1912 and 1913: the South Nantou Incident (1912), the Hsinchu/Dahu Incident (1913), the Tainan Guandi Temple Incident (1913), the Dongshijiao Incident (December 1913), and the main Miaoli arrests (December 1913).[^38] In September 1913, rebels broke into a police station in Dahu Township in Miaoli County and stole weapons, marking the beginning of active armed resistance.[^39] This demonstrated Luo's ability to move his organization from planning to direct action, even if the ultimate outcome would prove disastrous.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

The Miaoli Incident ultimately ended in catastrophic failure, with devastating consequences for Luo's followers and the broader Taiwanese resistance movement. In September 1913, when rebels raided the Dahu police station for weapons, Japanese police captured eight rebels who, under torture, revealed extensive information about the planned uprising.[^40] By October 1913, Japanese authorities had essentially uncovered and thwarted the entire conspiracy.[^41]

On December 18, 1913, Luo Fuxing was arrested in Tamsui while waiting for an opportunity to sail to mainland China to regroup.[^42] When arrested, authorities found on his person a notebook containing a detailed list of his comrades and supporters, leading to massive waves of arrests throughout Taiwan.[^43] This single tactical error—carrying such incriminating evidence—has been criticized by historians as an amateurish mistake that cost hundreds of lives.[^44]

The Japanese response was brutal and far exceeded the immediate threat posed by Luo's organization. In total, 921 people were reported to have been involved or implicated in the Miaoli Incident.[^45] The Japanese colonial government established a temporary court in Miaoli in February 1914 to collectively prosecute participants.[^46] On March 3, 1914, the court sentenced 20 people—including Luo Fuxing—to death by hanging.[^47] An additional 285 people received prison sentences, while 34 were acquitted, 578 granted non-prosecution, and 4 received administrative sanctions.[^48] The 20 condemned were executed by hanging at Taipei Prison in batches.[^49]

Critics have argued that Luo's planning was fundamentally unrealistic, underestimating both Japanese military capabilities and the level of support he could mobilize among the Taiwanese population.[^50] By 1913, Japan had consolidated its control over Taiwan through nearly two decades of "pacification" campaigns that had killed tens of thousands and created an extensive police surveillance system.[^51] The idea that 500 poorly armed insurgents could overthrow this apparatus through surprise attacks on police stations has been characterized as quixotic at best.[^52]

Furthermore, some historians have noted that Luo's Chinese nationalist ideology may not have resonated as strongly with ordinary Taiwanese as he hoped.[^53] By 1913, a generation of Taiwanese had grown up under Japanese rule and had no personal memory of Qing Chinese administration.[^54] The Qing dynasty's governance of Taiwan had been notoriously corrupt and inefficient, and some Taiwanese, particularly those benefiting from Japanese modernization programs, were ambivalent about "restoration" to Chinese rule.[^55]

The Japanese reprisal was also extraordinarily severe: Japanese police executed more than 1,000 Taiwanese in response to Luo's planned rebellion.[^56] This mass execution far exceeded the actual participants in the uprising and represented collective punishment designed to terrorize the Taiwanese population into submission.[^57] Some critics have argued that Luo's actions, however well-intentioned, provoked a level of Japanese violence that set back the Taiwanese resistance movement for years.[^58]

## Personal Life

Details about Luo Fuxing's personal and family life remain somewhat obscure in historical records, as is common for revolutionary figures who spent much of their adult lives in clandestine activities. What is known is that he did marry and have children, as evidenced by the existence of his granddaughter, Luo Qiuzhao (羅秋昭), who later wrote biographical works about her grandfather and became an important keeper of his memory.[^59]

The identity of Luo's wife and the names of his children are not prominently documented in the available historical sources, reflecting both the male-centered nature of revolutionary historiography and the precarious circumstances of Luo's life.[^60] Given that he was executed at age 28 in 1914, his children must have been very young when he died, and his wife would have faced the difficult position of being the widow of a convicted anti-Japanese revolutionary.[^61]

Contemporaries described Luo Fuxing as possessing a charismatic personality and strong oratorical skills that allowed him to inspire followers to risk their lives for the revolutionary cause.[^62] His multicultural background—Indonesian birth, Chinese education, European physical features, and experience living under Dutch and Japanese colonialism—gave him a unique worldview and the ability to connect with people across different cultural contexts.[^63]

Luo's European-like appearance, inherited from his mother's Dutch-Indonesian ancestry, was frequently noted by those who met him and may have provided some operational advantages in his revolutionary work.[^64] In the colonial context of early twentieth-century Asia, where racial hierarchies privileged Europeans, Luo's ambiguous appearance might have allowed him to evade some degree of Japanese surveillance that would have been directed at obviously Chinese activists.[^65]

His education and multilingual abilities—he spoke Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Malay, Dutch, and Japanese—reflected the cosmopolitan nature of the early twentieth-century revolutionary movement.[^66] Like many revolutionaries of his generation, Luo moved fluidly across borders and cultures, part of a transnational network of anti-imperialist activists who saw their struggles as interconnected.[^67]

## Legacy

Despite the failure of his uprising, Luo Fuxing's legacy has endured and evolved over more than a century. After his execution, supporters moved his remains to the foothills of Luogang Mountain near Miaoli Lake, where they raised funds to build the "Zhaozhong Pagoda" (昭忠塔) and "Zhaozhong Temple" (昭忠廟) as permanent memorials.[^68] These sites became pilgrimage destinations for those honoring Taiwan's anti-Japanese resistance.[^69]

In 1953, nearly four decades after Luo's death, President Chiang Kai-shek issued an official commendation recognizing Luo's revolutionary sacrifice.[^70] The Kuomintang government, which had relocated to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese Civil War, found in Luo's story a narrative that supported its claim to represent authentic Chinese nationalism and its portrayal of Taiwan as an inseparable part of China.[^71] A memorial tower was subsequently built in Dahu Township, Miaoli County, where Luo had organized some of his most significant activities.[^72]

Luo Fuxing was also enshrined in the National Revolutionary Martyrs' Shrine at Yuanshan in Taipei, alongside other revolutionaries who fought for Sun Yat-sen's republican ideals.[^73] In 1980, the Taiwan film production company China Film Corporation released "Great Lake Hero" (大湖英烈), starring Liu Yong and Jia Ling, which dramatized Luo Fuxing's life and martyrdom for a popular audience.[^74] The film reinforced his status as a national hero within the Chinese Nationalist historical narrative that dominated Taiwan during the authoritarian period.[^75]

Luo Fuxing is recognized on both sides of the Taiwan Strait as a significant historical figure, though his legacy is interpreted differently in different political contexts.[^76] In the People's Republic of China, he is celebrated as one of the "Three Anti-Japanese Heroes" of Jiaoling, Guangdong (alongside Qiu Fengjia and Xie Jinyuan), emphasizing his role in China's broader resistance against Japanese imperialism.[^77] His ancestral hometown in Jiaoling County has established museums and memorial sites honoring his revolutionary contributions.[^78]

In contemporary Taiwan, Luo Fuxing's legacy has become contested terrain in the island's ongoing debates about national identity and historical memory. Former President Ma Ying-jeou, representing the Kuomintang's pan-Chinese perspective, has prominently honored Luo alongside other anti-Japanese resistance leaders such as Qiu Fengjia, Jiang Shaozu, Lin Zumou, and Mona Rudao.[^79] Ma's emphasis on Taiwan's anti-Japanese resistance serves his political argument that Taiwan's history is inseparable from Chinese history and that Taiwanese identity is a subset of Chinese identity.[^80]

However, Luo's prominence in Taiwan's historical narrative has declined under the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government, which emphasizes a distinct Taiwanese identity rather than Chinese nationalism.[^81] Controversies over Taiwan's twelve-year compulsory education curriculum have centered on whether figures like Luo Fuxing should be prominently featured in history textbooks or relegated to appendices.[^82] Critics of the DPP's approach argue that marginalizing anti-Japanese resistance leaders like Luo dishonors Taiwan's forebears who fought against colonial oppression.[^83] Supporters counter that overemphasizing Chinese nationalist resistance obscures other important aspects of Taiwan's complex history, including indigenous resistance, social movements, and Taiwan's development of a distinct civic identity.[^84]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars sympathetic to Chinese nationalism have consistently praised Luo Fuxing as an exemplary patriot who sacrificed his life fighting against Japanese imperialism. This perspective emphasizes his dedication to Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary ideals and his refusal to accept the colonial partition of Chinese territory.[^85] Luo's participation in both the Second Guangzhou Uprising and the Taiwan resistance demonstrates, in this view, an unwavering commitment to national liberation that transcended personal safety.[^86]

Historians have noted Luo's remarkable organizational abilities in creating a clandestine resistance network across multiple regions of Taiwan under intense Japanese surveillance.[^87] The fact that he successfully recruited hundreds of followers and coordinated five separate uprisings, even though ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrates sophisticated revolutionary planning and charismatic leadership.[^88] Some scholars argue that the Miaoli Incident, despite its failure, helped maintain a spirit of resistance among Taiwanese that would resurface in later anti-Japanese movements, including the Tapani Incident of 1915.[^89]

From a transnational perspective, Luo Fuxing represents an important example of the early twentieth-century anti-colonial revolutionary networks that spanned Asia.[^90] His life trajectory—from Indonesia to China to Taiwan, his multilingual abilities, and his connections to the broader Tongmenghui movement—illustrates how anti-imperial resistance was coordinated across colonial boundaries.[^91] Scholars of Southeast Asian Chinese diaspora communities have highlighted how overseas Chinese like Luo played crucial roles in financing and supporting revolutionary movements in China.[^92]

Defenders of Luo's legacy also emphasize the moral courage required to lead armed resistance against the Japanese colonial state, knowing that failure would likely result in execution.[^93] At age 28, Luo chose martyrdom for a political cause rather than the relative safety and prosperity he might have enjoyed using his education and family connections for personal advancement.[^94] This selfless dedication to a cause greater than oneself resonates with traditional Chinese values of loyalty and righteousness (忠義).[^95]

### Negative Views

Critical historians have questioned the strategic wisdom and ultimate value of Luo Fuxing's armed uprising, arguing that it was poorly conceived and resulted in tremendous suffering for minimal political gain.[^96] The Miaoli Incident led directly to the execution of 20 people, imprisonment of 285, and the killing of more than 1,000 Taiwanese in Japanese reprisals—a catastrophic outcome that arguably set back the Taiwanese resistance movement rather than advancing it.[^97]

Some scholars argue that Luo's Chinese nationalist ideology was fundamentally out of touch with the realities of Taiwan in 1913.[^98] After eighteen years of Japanese rule, during which time Japan had invested heavily in modernizing Taiwan's infrastructure, education, and economy, many Taiwanese—particularly educated elites and commercial classes—had developed complex relationships with the colonial state that could not be reduced to simple resistance or collaboration.[^99] Luo's assumption that appeals to Chinese nationalism would inspire mass uprising may have been based on his own ideological commitments rather than accurate assessment of Taiwanese political consciousness.[^100]

Critics have also pointed to serious operational failures in Luo's planning, particularly his decision to carry a notebook listing all his comrades when attempting to flee Taiwan.[^101] This single error enabled Japanese authorities to conduct mass arrests and effectively decapitate the entire resistance organization.[^102] More professional revolutionary planning would have included compartmentalization of information and secure communication protocols to prevent such catastrophic betrayals.[^103]

From a Taiwanese nationalist perspective, some historians argue that Luo Fuxing represented an external imposition of Chinese nationalism onto Taiwan rather than an authentic expression of Taiwanese aspirations.[^104] Luo was born in Indonesia, educated partly in China and Southeast Asia, and came to Taiwan as an agent of Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui with a mission defined in Nanjing rather than in Taipei.[^105] His agenda prioritized Taiwan's "return" to Chinese sovereignty rather than Taiwanese self-determination or indigenous political development.[^106]

Contemporary critics of highlighting Luo Fuxing's legacy argue that excessive emphasis on anti-Japanese resistance serves the political agenda of Chinese nationalists who wish to subordinate Taiwanese identity to Chinese identity.[^107] They point out that lionizing figures like Luo as heroes implies that Japanese colonialism was Taiwan's defining historical experience and that Taiwan's political destiny is necessarily linked to China.[^108] This narrative, critics argue, obscures Taiwan's indigenous history, the complexity of experiences under Japanese rule, and Taiwan's post-1945 development of democratic institutions and distinct civic identity.[^109]

## Famous Quotes

While specific documented quotes from Luo Fuxing himself are limited in the available historical sources, several statements and principles associated with him have been preserved:

> "Willing to be firewood to heat the revolution" (甘作為革命加熱的柴火)

This phrase has been attributed to Luo Fuxing's revolutionary philosophy, expressing his willingness to sacrifice himself to fuel the revolutionary movement, even if he would not live to see its ultimate success.[^110]

> "Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Japanese occupation is temporary. We must arouse national consciousness and restore Taiwan to the motherland."

This statement reflects Luo's Chinese nationalist ideology and his fundamental mission as articulated by Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui.[^111]

> "The success of the Xinhai Revolution on the mainland proves that the Qing dynasty can be overthrown. The same determination can drive out the Japanese from Taiwan."

Luo reportedly used this argument to recruit followers, drawing parallels between the successful 1911 Revolution and the anticipated liberation of Taiwan.[^112]
