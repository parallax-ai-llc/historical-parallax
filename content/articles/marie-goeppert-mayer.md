## Summary

Marie Goeppert Mayer was a German-born American theoretical physicist who shared the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physics for proposing the nuclear shell model of the atomic nucleus. She was the second woman to win the Nobel Prize in Physics after Marie Curie. Despite working for many years without pay due to anti-nepotism rules, she made fundamental contributions to nuclear physics. She also predicted two-photon absorption, now called the Goeppert Mayer unit.
