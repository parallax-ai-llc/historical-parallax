## Summary

**Aktion T4** was the Nazi regime's secret euthanasia program to systematically murder people with physical and mental disabilities, whom the Nazis deemed "life unworthy of life" (*lebensunwertes Leben*) and "useless eaters." Named after the headquarters at **Tiergartenstraße 4** in Berlin, the program murdered huge numbers of children and adults using lethal injection and carbon monoxide gas. It was the crucial "training ground" for the Holocaust, providing the technology (gas chambers) and personnel for the extermination camps.

## Methods and Centers

### The 6 Killing Centers
The operation setup six dedicated "sanatoriums" disguised as medical facilities: **Hartheim**, **Hadamar**, Grafeneck, Brandenburg, Bernburg, and Sonnenstein.
*   **The Gray Buses:** The victims were transported to these centers in distinct gray buses with painted-over windows. The sight of smoke from the crematoria and the smell of burning flesh terrified local populations.

### The Innovation of Gas
T4 was where the Nazis perfected the method of industrial killing.
*   **Fake Showers:** At Hadamar and Hartheim, victims were told they were going to the showers. They were led into sealed tiled rooms where pure **carbon monoxide gas** was pumped in.
*   **Gold Teeth:** After the gassing, "disinfectors" would pry gold teeth from the corpses before cremating them.
*   **Fake Causes:** Families received urns filled with random ashes and death certificates citing false causes like "heart failure" or "pneumonia."

### Child Euthanasia
The program started with children. Doctors and midwives were required to report newborns with disabilities. These infants were sent to "Special Pediatric Wards" where they were killed via lethal overdose (Luminal) or slow starvation to simulate natural death.

## Reaction and "Stop"

### Bishop von Galen's Protest
The program was an open secret. In August 1941, the Catholic **Bishop Clemens August Graf von Galen** of Münster delivered deeply powerful sermons denouncing the killings.
*   **The Quote:** "If you establish and apply the principle that you can kill 'unproductive' fellow human beings... then woe betide us all when we become old and frail!"
*   **The Halt:** Fearing public unrest, **Hitler** officially ordered a halt to the gas chamber killings on August 24, 1941.

### "Wild Euthanasia" (Phase 2)
The killing didn't truly stop; it just went underground. In the second phase ("Wild Euthanasia"), doctors in hospitals simply starved patients to death or used lethal injections, eventually killing far more people than the official gas chamber phase.

## Connection to the Holocaust

Aktion T4 was the rehearsal for the Final Solution.
*   **Personnel Transfer:** When T4 "stopped" in 1941, the experienced staff (like **Christian Wirth** and **Franz Stangl**) were transferred to Poland to build and run the extermination camps of **Operation Reinhard** (Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec).
*   **Technology:** They brought the gas chamber technology and the deception tactics (fake showers) with them, scaling it up from thousands to millions.
