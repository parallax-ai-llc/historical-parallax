## Summary

The USS Nimitz "Tic Tac" incident is arguably the most important UFO case in modern history because it breached the wall of government secrecy. Occurring in November 2004 during training exercises off the coast of California, elite US Navy fighter pilots encountered an advanced aerial object that defied the laws of physics.

The object, described as looking like a giant white "Tic Tac" breath mint, had no wings, no exhaust, and moved with impossible speed and agility. Unlike historical cases often dismissed as "swamp gas," this encounter was corroborated by the world's most advanced radar systems (SPY-1), eyewitness testimony from four pilots, and infrared gun-camera footage (FLIR). In 2017, the *New York Times* broke the story, and in 2020, the Pentagon officially released the video and confirmed the objects were "unidentified."[^1] This incident directly led to the current era of Congressional hearings and the establishment of the AARO office.

## The Encounter

### The Radar Anomalies (Early Nov 2004)
For weeks, the **USS Princeton** (a Ticonderoga-class cruiser escorting the carrier USS Nimitz) had been tracking mysterious "Anomalous Aerial Vehicles" (AAVs).
*   **Behavior:** The objects would drop from 80,000 feet (space) to 20,000 feet in less than a second, hover for hours, and then shoot back up or drop to sea level.
*   **The Operator:** Senior Chief **Kevin Day**, the Princeton's radar operator, watched these "swarms" of objects baffle the Aegis combat system.[^2]

### The Intercept (Nov 14, 2004)
Commander **David Fravor** (Squadron CO, callsign "Sex") and Lt. Cmdr. **Alex Dietrich** were flying two F/A-18F Super Hornets on a routine training mission. The USS Princeton diverted them to investigate a "real-world contact."
*   **The "Whitewater":** Arriving at the coordinates, the pilots looked down and saw an area of churning, roiling water ("whitewater") in an otherwise calm ocean, suggesting a larger object submerged just below the surface.
*   **The Tic Tac:** Hovering about 50 feet above the whitewater was a white, oblong object, approx. 40 feet long (size of a fighter jet). It had no visible control surfaces (wings, tail), no windows, and no infrared exhaust plume. It was moving erratically "like a ping pong ball in a jar."[^3]

### The Dogfight
Fravor initiated a descent to investigate. As he spiraled down, the object began to spiral *up* to meet him—mirroring his maneuvers.
*   **The Vanishing:** Fravor decided to cut across the circle to get a closer look. As he closed in (within half a mile), the object accelerated with tremendous speed—"like a bullet"—and vanished in a blink of an eye.
*   **Radar Re-acquisition:** Seconds later, the USS Princeton radioed: *"Sir, you're not gonna believe this... that thing is at your CAP (Combat Air Patrol) point 60 miles away."* The object had traveled 60 miles in less than a minute.[^4]

## The Video Evidence (FLIR1)

After Fravor and Dietrich landed, a second flight launched (Lt. Chad Underwood, callsign "Sex 2"). He was equipped with an advanced ATFLIR targeting pod.
*   **The Lock:** Underwood located the object and locked his sensors on it.
*   **The Footage:** He recorded the now-famous grainy monochrome video showing the oblong object gliding effortlessly before snapping to the left and disappearing off-screen. Underwood is the one who coined the term **"Tic Tac"** due to its shape.[^5]

## Characteristics of the Object (The Five Observables)

Former Pentagon intelligence official Luis Elizondo later categorized the Tic Tac's capabilities under the "Five Observables" of UAP technology:
1.  **Anti-Gravity Lift:** No visible propulsion or wings (lift).
2.  **Instantaneous Acceleration:** 0 to Mach supersonic speeds instantly; g-forces that would pulverize a human pilot.
3.  **Hypersonic Velocity:** Speeds exceeding Mach 5 without sonic booms.
4.  **Low Observability:** Hard to track on radar (stealth).
5.  **Trans-Medium Travel:** Ability to move seamlessly between space, atmosphere, and water (the "whitewater" disturbance).[^6]

## Aftermath and Significance

### The "Black Money" Program
The incident remained a "bar story" (rumor) for years until 2017, when it was revealed that the Pentagon had a secret UFO hunting program called **AATIP** (Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program), run by Luis Elizondo. AATIP had studied the Nimitz case extensively.[^7]

### Official Confirmation
*   **2019:** The US Navy confirmed the leaked videos were genuine.
*   **2020:** The DoD officially released the videos.
*   **2023:** David Fravor testified under oath before the US Congress House Oversight Committee, stating:
    > "The technology that we faced was far superior to anything that we had, have today, or are looking to develop in the next 10+ years."[^8]
