## Summary

Marcus Antonius, known in English as Mark Antony (83 BC–30 BC), was a Roman general and politician who played a pivotal role in the transformation of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. A loyal subordinate to Julius Caesar during the Gallic Wars and Roman Civil War, Antony later became one of the three rulers of the Second Triumvirate alongside Octavian and Lepidus. His legendary romance with Cleopatra VII of Egypt and his political rivalry with Octavian culminated in civil war, ending with his defeat at the Battle of Actium and subsequent suicide in Alexandria. Despite his military brilliance and political significance, Antony's legacy has been shaped by centuries of propaganda portraying him as a man who sacrificed Roman duty for foreign entanglements and personal passion.

## Early Life and Background

Marcus Antonius was born on January 14, 83 BC in Rome to Marcus Antonius Creticus and Julia Antonia, entering a world of both privilege and political turmoil.[^1] His father earned the cognomen "Creticus" due to his military operations in Crete, though his career ended in failure and disgrace. His grandfather, also named Marcus Antonius, had been one of the leading orators of his generation and had served as consul and censor, establishing the family's prestige in Roman political circles.[^2] Through his mother Julia, Antony was related to the Julian gens and was a distant cousin of Julius Caesar—specifically, Julia's father was Lucius Julius Caesar, making her a third cousin of the famous general. This maternal connection would prove crucial to Antony's later career, though his official status remained plebeian rather than patrician.[^3]

Antony's early years were marked by financial hardship and familial instability. His father's death, combined with his mother's second husband's financial misfortunes, left Antony and his brothers struggling on the streets of Rome.[^4] According to the ancient historian Plutarch, Antony spent his teenage years wandering through Rome with his brothers and friends, gambling, drinking heavily, and becoming involved in scandalous love affairs—a lack of parental guidance that would characterize much of ancient commentary on his character.[^5] Despite being promised an excellent education befitting a young man from a distinguished family, focusing on public speaking and critical thinking, Antony's reckless behavior squandered much of this opportunity. Deep in gambling debt and pursued by creditors, he fled to Greece in 58 BC to escape his financial troubles.[^6]

It was in the eastern Mediterranean that Antony first gained military experience and began to redeem himself from his dissolute youth. He took part in military campaigns in Judaea, achieving his first military distinctions with important victories at Alexandrium and Machaerus.[^7] Between 57 and 55 BC, Antony served with distinction as a cavalry commander under Aulus Gabinius, the Roman governor of Syria, participating in campaigns in both Judaea and Egypt. During this period, Antony first encountered the young Cleopatra, then only fourteen years old, though their fateful relationship would not begin for more than a decade.[^8] This early military service established Antony's reputation as a capable officer and prepared him for the next crucial phase of his career: service under Julius Caesar in Gaul.

## Rise to Power

In 54 BC, Antony secured a position on Julius Caesar's military staff, joining the conquest of Gaul at a critical juncture in Rome's expansion.[^9] Serving under Caesar proved transformative for Antony, who demonstrated excellent military leadership and quickly became one of Caesar's most trusted commanders. His most notable contribution during the Gallic Wars came in 52 BC at the Battle of Alesia, where Antony commanded Caesar's cavalry during the decisive victory against the Gallic chieftain Vercingetorix.[^10] That same year, Antony held the office of quaestor, a position of financial administration that granted him a lifetime seat in the Roman Senate, establishing his political legitimacy.[^11] Antony remained on Caesar's military staff until 50 BC, participating in the mopping-up operations across Gaul to secure Caesar's conquest of the region.

When civil war erupted between Caesar and Pompey in 49 BC, Antony was serving as tribune of the plebs and vigorously supported Caesar's cause.[^12] He fought in the brief Italian campaign that forced Pompey to evacuate the peninsula, demonstrating both military competence and political loyalty. After Caesar departed for Spain, Antony was left in charge of Italy, a significant responsibility that showed Caesar's confidence in his abilities.[^13] By 48 BC, Antony had joined Caesar in Greece, where he commanded the left wing at the Battle of Pharsalus, one of the most decisive engagements of the civil war. Following this victory, Caesar sent Antony back to Rome as magister equitum (master of the horse)—a dictator's second-in-command—to maintain order in Italy while Caesar eliminated political opponents in Greece, North Africa, and Spain.[^14]

By 44 BC, when Julius Caesar assumed his fifth and final consulship, Antony served as his co-consul, occupying the highest political office alongside his patron and distant cousin.[^15] When Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March (March 15, 44 BC), Antony initially fled Rome dressed as a slave, fearing for his own life. However, he soon returned to protect his friend's legacy, taking charge of Caesar's will and papers and delivering a stirring eulogy for the fallen dictator that inflamed public opinion against the assassins.[^16] Antony's funeral oration—though its exact words are lost to history—was the most important speech of his career, transforming public sentiment and rendering Caesar's killers as targets of popular outrage despite the amnesty that had recently protected them from prosecution.[^17]

The political situation following Caesar's death proved extraordinarily complex, as Antony maneuvered between competing factions including the senatorial conservatives, Caesar's assassins, and Caesar's designated heir, his great-nephew Octavian (later known as Augustus). Initially, Antony and Octavian were bitter rivals, but political necessity led them to form the Second Triumvirate with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in October 43 BC. This alliance was formally constituted by the Lex Titia on November 27, 43 BC, granting the three men practically absolute power for five years, with authority to make or repeal legislation, issue judicial punishments without due process or appeal, and appoint all magistrates.[^18] Before marching east against Caesar's assassins, the triumvirs issued brutal proscriptions against their enemies in Rome, condemning 300 senators and over 2,000 Roman knights to death, confiscating their properties, and offering cash rewards to bounty hunters and informers.[^19] Among the victims was the great orator Cicero, who had attacked Antony relentlessly in a series of speeches known as the Philippics; Antony ensured Cicero's name appeared on the death lists despite Octavian's initial reluctance.[^20]

## Major Achievements

The pinnacle of Mark Antony's military career came at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, where he and Octavian decisively defeated the forces of Caesar's assassins, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus.[^21] This massive confrontation, involving up to 200,000 men in one of the largest battles of the Roman civil wars, took place in two engagements on the plain west of ancient Philippi in Macedonia. In the first battle on October 3, 42 BC, Brutus pushed back Octavian's forces and entered his camp, but to the south, Antony's superior generalship routed Cassius's army. Upon hearing false reports that Brutus had also been defeated, Cassius committed suicide.[^22] Three weeks later, on October 23, a second engagement finished off Brutus's remaining forces after a hard-fought battle. Brutus then took his own life, leaving the triumvirate in undisputed control of the Roman Republic. The Battle of Philippi marked the highest point of Antony's career—at that moment, he was the most famous Roman general and the unquestionable senior partner of the Second Triumvirate.[^23]

Following this victory, the triumvirs divided control of Rome's territories: Octavian would rule the West, Antony the East, and Lepidus would govern Africa.[^24] Antony's eastern provinces were far wealthier and more economically developed than Octavian's western territories, seemingly giving him the advantage in the partnership. As ruler of the eastern Mediterranean, Antony worked to establish Roman authority, collect taxes and tribute, and prepare for a major campaign against Rome's longtime enemy, the Parthian Empire. During this period, he demonstrated considerable administrative and diplomatic ability, reorganizing client kingdoms and securing alliances that would provide military and financial support for his planned campaigns.[^25]

However, Antony's most consequential political act in the East—and one that would be used extensively in propaganda against him—was the Donations of Alexandria in 34 BC. Following a moderately successful campaign in Armenia (which partially compensated for his earlier Parthian disaster), Antony held an elaborate ceremony in Alexandria in which he publicly distributed eastern territories to Cleopatra and their children. He formally elevated Caesarion, Cleopatra's son by Julius Caesar, to power as "King of Kings," and granted vast territories to his own children by Cleopatra: Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene, and Ptolemy Philadelphus.[^26] While this ceremony had precedent in Roman practice of establishing client rulers, the scale and theatrical nature of the Donations shocked Roman opinion and provided Octavian with devastating propaganda material.

Antony's relationship with Cleopatra, which began in 41 BC when he summoned her to meet him at Tarsus in Cilicia, was both a genuine romance and a strategic political alliance.[^27] Apart from their undoubted mutual affection, Cleopatra needed Antony to revive the old boundaries of the Ptolemaic kingdom and protect her position as queen of Egypt, while Antony needed Egypt's vast wealth as a source of supplies and funds for his planned Parthian campaign.[^28] Their partnership produced three children and lasted eleven years, though it was interrupted by Antony's marriage to Octavia Minor, Octavian's sister, in 40 BC—a union arranged to cement the fragile alliance between the two triumvirs.[^29] Through Octavia, Antony fathered two daughters, Antonia Major and Antonia Minor, both of whom became ancestors of later Roman emperors, ensuring Antony's bloodline continued in the imperial dynasty despite his eventual defeat.[^30]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Mark Antony's reputation suffered devastating attacks even during his lifetime, most notably from Marcus Tullius Cicero in a series of fourteen speeches known as the Philippics, delivered in 44 and 43 BC.[^31] In these orations, Cicero attempted to rally the Senate against Antony, whom he denounced as a tyrant and a threat to the Roman Republic. The Second Philippic, which was never actually delivered but circulated as a written polemic, mounted a comprehensive character assassination of Antony, cataloguing what Cicero called his "atrocities" and depicting him as a man who reveled in excessive drinking, gambling, and partying—behavior Cicero argued demonstrated Antony's lack of the self-control and morality necessary for Roman statesmanship.[^32] Cicero characterized Antony as incompetent, extravagant in spending, and lacking true leadership skills, suggesting he had been given power precisely because he was too inept to abuse it.[^33] The Philippics successfully convinced the Senate to declare Antony an enemy of the state, though this victory proved pyrrhic: when Antony formed the Second Triumvirate, he insisted on proscribing Cicero in revenge, and the great orator was hunted down and killed.[^34]

Antony's most significant military failure came with his disastrous Parthian campaign of 36 BC, which severely tarnished his reputation and weakened his position against Octavian.[^35] Antony invaded Parthia with a massive force of approximately 90,000 to 100,000 men, including sixteen legions (about 80,000 men) and forces from client kingdoms providing 7,000 infantry and 6,000 heavy cavalry, along with siege equipment transported in 300 wagons and an 80-foot battering ram.[^36] However, the campaign quickly went awry due to what modern scholars identify as Antony's poor planning and management. When his baggage train was attacked by Parthian cavalry under Monaeses, Antony lost his siege equipment and 10,000 legionaries under Statianus were killed—a disaster attributable to Antony's overconfidence and impatience.[^37] The subsequent siege of Phraaspa failed without the necessary equipment, and Antony showed no clear perception of how to fight the Parthians effectively. The retreat through difficult terrain proved devastating, with approximately 32,000 men lost in total—20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry perished, more than half from disease rather than combat.[^38] While some historians view this as merely a setback rather than a complete disaster like Crassus's crushing defeat in 53 BC, others believe it was a turning point that so severely damaged Antony's prestige that his eventual defeat became inevitable.[^39]

Ancient sources consistently emphasized Antony's personal vices and character flaws, creating a portrait of a man whose talents were undermined by moral weaknesses. He was described as a heavy drinker and inveterate womanizer, a great lover but a poor husband who failed to honor his multiple marriages.[^40] Plutarch, writing in the early second century CE, portrayed Antony's youth as dissolute and his adult character as prone to extremes—capable of great military achievement but lured into destructive luxury when successful.[^41] Ancient historians traced his supposedly uncontrolled temper and violent reactions, characterizing his behavior as erratic and his political judgment as severely flawed.[^42] However, modern scholars recognize that much of this negative portrayal reflects Augustan propaganda rather than objective historical assessment. Octavian won not only the military conflict but also the propaganda war, ensuring that subsequent histories adopted his hostile characterization of his defeated rival.[^43]

## Personal Life

Mark Antony's personal life was marked by a series of marriages that reflected both political calculation and genuine passion. His marital history included unions with Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia, Octavia Minor, and finally Cleopatra, though sources vary on exact details of his earlier marriages.[^44] His third wife, Fulvia, whom he married in 44 BC after her previous marriages to Publius Clodius Pulcher and Gaius Scribonius Curio, was a formidable political operator in her own right. Throughout their marriage, Fulvia actively defended Antony from Cicero's attacks, sustained his popularity among his soldiers, and worked to hinder Octavian's rise to power.[^45] She bore Antony two sons: Marcus Antonius Antyllus and Iullus Antonius. Fulvia's death in 40 BC came at what ancient sources described as an opportune moment, as it enabled Antony's marriage to Octavia Minor, Octavian's sister, which was quickly arranged to cement the tenuous relationship between the two triumvirs.[^46]

Octavia proved to be a loyal and dutiful wife despite Antony's eventual abandonment of her for Cleopatra. She bore Antony two daughters who survived to adulthood: Antonia Major and Antonia Minor, both of whom became ancestors of later Roman emperors including Caligula, Claudius, and Nero.[^47] When Antony divorced Octavia in late 33 BC to formalize his relationship with Cleopatra, Octavia's dignified response and continued care for Antony's children by other women stood in stark contrast to the propaganda image of Antony as enslaved to foreign luxury. After Antony's death in 30 BC, Octavia demonstrated remarkable compassion by raising not only her own children and those from Antony's marriage to Fulvia, but also the children of Cleopatra, providing them with care and protection despite the circumstances of their father's defeat.[^48]

Antony's relationship with Cleopatra VII of Egypt dominated the final decade of his life and shaped his historical legacy. They first met in 41 BC when Antony, ruling the eastern provinces, summoned her to Tarsus to account for her actions during the civil war. Cleopatra arrived on her luxurious barge in an elaborate display calculated to impress the Roman general, and their mutual attraction proved immediate.[^49] Their partnership produced three children: twins Cleopatra Selene and Alexander Helios, born in 40 BC, and Ptolemy Philadelphus, born later.[^50] Ancient sources portrayed Antony as completely dominated by Cleopatra's charms, describing him as "enslaved to the passion and witchery of Cleopatra," though modern scholarship recognizes the relationship combined genuine affection with clear strategic benefits for both parties.[^51]

According to ancient historians, Antony's personality encompassed striking contradictions. He was described as an incredible soldier, capable orator, and natural leader of men, yet also as a flawed and naïve politician prone to arrogance who could be both an intensely loyal friend and the bitterest of enemies.[^52] Plutarch praised Antony's ability to react positively to adversity, noting that his greatest strength emerged when backed into a corner, though he also criticized Antony's love of luxury as a moral failure that undermined him during periods of success.[^53] While pleasant, attractive, and generous to friends, Antony reportedly lacked consistent judgment and self-control, with ancient sources emphasizing his natural disposition toward excess and occasionally violent reactions that many writers, both ancient and modern, considered erratic.[^54]

## Legacy

Mark Antony's death on August 1, 30 BC marked not only the end of his life but effectively the end of the Roman Republic. Upon hearing false reports that Cleopatra had committed suicide, Antony stabbed himself with his sword, but survived long enough to be brought to Cleopatra's monument where he died in her arms.[^55] Cleopatra herself died shortly thereafter, and with her death, Egypt—the last of the great Hellenistic kingdoms—became a province of Rome.[^56] Octavian emerged as the sole ruler of the Roman world and would soon transform himself into Augustus, the first Roman emperor. Despite his defeat, Antony's bloodline survived and eventually merged with the imperial family: his daughters by Octavia became the grandmothers and great-grandmothers of multiple emperors, ensuring that Antony's descendants occupied the Roman throne for generations.[^57]

Antony's historical reputation has been profoundly shaped by the propaganda campaign waged against him by Octavian in the years leading to the Battle of Actium. Octavian's minister Gaius Maecenas orchestrated a systematic effort to present Antony as a man betraying Roman values and placing foreign interests ahead of the Republic.[^58] The most damaging evidence came from Antony's own will, which Octavian illegally seized from the Temple of Vesta. The will recognized Caesarion as Caesar's legitimate heir, left Antony's possessions to his children by Cleopatra, and indicated his desire to be buried with Cleopatra in Alexandria rather than Rome.[^59] Octavian's propaganda declared unmistakably that Antony belonged not to Rome but to Egypt and Cleopatra. This narrative proved so successful that it shaped how ancient historians portrayed Antony for centuries, with writers like Plutarch and Cassius Dio—while acknowledging his military talents—emphasizing his moral failings and political errors.[^60]

William Shakespeare's dramatic portrayals cemented Antony's image in Western cultural consciousness. In "Julius Caesar," Shakespeare presented Antony as Caesar's loyal friend and a skilled orator who heroically avenges the assassination, though appearing somewhat shallow to those unfamiliar with his depths.[^61] In "Antony and Cleopatra," Shakespeare depicted a more complex figure: a man who had left behind the heroism of his youth and who, in middle age, has fallen hopelessly in love, torn between reason and emotion, duty and desire, ultimately unable to bear the stress of these conflicting loyalties.[^62] Shakespeare invested both Antony and Cleopatra with tragic grandeur despite their flaws, granting his defeated heroes opportunities to best their conqueror through the power of their love and the dignity of their deaths. Much of Shakespeare's play concerns the struggle over which images of Antony and Cleopatra would be handed down through history—whether as humiliated captives or triumphant lovers—with the dramatist ultimately choosing to honor their romance rather than their political defeat.[^63]

Modern scholarship has worked to separate the historical Mark Antony from centuries of accumulated propaganda and literary interpretation. Contemporary historians recognize that Octavian won not only the military conflict but also the propaganda war, resulting in a distorted image of Antony that subsequent ancient authors adopted and adapted, delivering an Antony "irresistibly depraved, startlingly brave, sometimes cunning, but almost always constitutionally incapable of choosing the right side of history."[^64] Recent scholarship reveals a more nuanced figure: an honorable Roman, an effective general, and an able diplomat as well as a lover of women and good times.[^65] Modern biographies attempt to assimilate the various, often competing ancient sources to provide realism to the caricature of this major historical figure, recognizing that first-century Rome was not as parochial as Augustan propaganda suggested and that Antony's embrace of Hellenistic customs reflected the connected Mediterranean world rather than a betrayal of Roman identity.[^66] While no serious historian has ever taken Octavian's propaganda literally, the challenge remains to understand Antony through more objective lenses, correcting centuries of bias while acknowledging the genuine complexity of his political and military career.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars have increasingly recognized Mark Antony's genuine abilities and accomplishments, working to rescue his reputation from the distortions of Augustan propaganda. Recent scholarship emphasizes that Antony was fundamentally an honorable Roman who served his patron Julius Caesar with exemplary loyalty and demonstrated consistent military excellence throughout his career.[^67] His command at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC was tactically superior to that of his partner Octavian, and it was primarily Antony's generalship that defeated Caesar's assassins and ended the Liberators' civil war.[^68] Academic studies highlight Antony's considerable diplomatic skills in managing Rome's eastern provinces, reorganizing client kingdoms, and building the alliances necessary to maintain Roman power in a vast and culturally complex region.[^69]

Historians have also reassessed Antony's relationship with Cleopatra, recognizing that while ancient sources portrayed him as enslaved to her charms, the partnership represented a sophisticated political alliance entirely consistent with Roman practice. Modern scholarship emphasizes the ancient Mediterranean's connected history and the integration of Hellenistic and Roman political systems, suggesting that Antony's embrace of Egyptian royal ceremony and his public association with Cleopatra reflected the realities of governing the eastern empire rather than a betrayal of Roman values.[^70] Far from being the naïve dupe of propaganda, Antony understood that controlling Egypt's wealth was essential to Roman power, and his alliance with Cleopatra was a rational strategic choice. Some scholars argue that had Antony won the civil war against Octavian, his model of a cosmopolitan empire embracing diverse cultural traditions might have produced a very different—and potentially more stable—imperial system than the more narrowly Roman model that Augustus ultimately established.[^71]

Plutarch, despite his generally hostile portrayal influenced by pro-Augustan sources, acknowledged Antony's military virtues, particularly his ability to maintain morale and find solutions when circumstances appeared desperate.[^72] Modern biographers emphasize that Antony's generosity to friends, his personal courage in battle, and his capacity for inspiring loyalty among his soldiers represented genuine leadership qualities that explain his prolonged success. The fact that Antony nearly defeated Octavian despite the latter's superior resources and propaganda apparatus suggests considerable political and military skill rather than the incompetence that Cicero claimed.[^73]

### Negative Views

Despite modern scholarly rehabilitation, serious criticisms of Mark Antony's character and judgment remain well-founded. His catastrophic Parthian campaign of 36 BC demonstrated poor strategic planning, overconfidence, and an inability to adapt to an enemy's tactics—flaws that cost tens of thousands of Roman lives and squandered the military advantage he held over Octavian.[^74] Critics observe that Antony fundamentally misjudged both the military challenge posed by the Parthians and the political consequences of such a high-profile failure, showing that whatever his tactical abilities in conventional warfare, he lacked the broader strategic vision necessary for supreme command.[^75] Modern military historians note that Antony showed "no clear perception of how to fight the Parthians nor any consistent strategic plan or political aim," suggesting limitations in his military intellect that went beyond the specific circumstances of the campaign.[^76]

Antony's political judgment proved even more seriously flawed than his military planning. While his skill on the battlefield was undeniable, this ability did not translate into political acumen—without Caesar to guide him, Antony quickly faced political difficulties and proved himself unpopular with significant constituencies in Rome.[^77] His decision to conduct the Donations of Alexandria in such a public and theatrical manner provided Octavian with devastating propaganda material that Antony should have anticipated. Even if the substance of his eastern arrangements was defensible, the optics were disastrous, and Antony's apparent inability to understand how his actions would be perceived in Rome suggests political tone-deafness that ultimately proved fatal to his cause.[^78]

Ancient sources' emphasis on Antony's personal vices—his heavy drinking, womanizing, gambling, and financial extravagance—cannot be entirely dismissed as propaganda, as even friendly sources acknowledged these tendencies.[^79] Cicero's characterization of Antony as lacking self-control and prone to excess appears to have contained substantial truth, even allowing for rhetorical exaggeration. The ancient historian Cassius Dio recorded how the general affection of the Roman people shifted toward Octavian during the triumviral period, suggesting that Antony's personality and behavior genuinely alienated important constituencies.[^80] His treatment of his wife Octavia—abandoning her publicly for Cleopatra and divorcing her to formalize his Egyptian liaison—may have been emotionally honest but was politically catastrophic, alienating her brother Octavian and providing a personal dimension to their political conflict that made reconciliation impossible.

Ultimately, historians must acknowledge that Antony lost the civil war, and while this outcome reflected many factors including Octavian's superior propaganda and Agrippa's naval genius, Antony's own strategic errors contributed significantly to his defeat. His decision to fight a naval battle at Actium despite having inferior naval forces, his failure to maintain the loyalty of key client kings and commanders who defected before the battle, and his apparent psychological collapse following the defeat all suggest limitations in his character and judgment that transcended the distortions of Augustan propaganda.[^81] As one modern scholar notes, later historians "adopted and adapted ancient themes, delivering readers an Antony who was irresistibly depraved, startlingly brave, sometimes cunning, but almost always constitutionally incapable of choosing the right side of history"—an assessment that, while harsh, contains elements of historical truth alongside propaganda-driven exaggeration.[^82]

## Famous Quotes

> "Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones; So let it be with Caesar."

This famous line from Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" represents the theatrical version of Antony's funeral oration for Caesar. While the exact words of the historical speech are lost, it was the most important speech of Antony's career, transforming public opinion against Caesar's assassins.[^83]

> "He was my friend, faithful and just to me: But Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man."

Another line from Shakespeare's funeral oration scene, this quote demonstrates Antony's rhetorical skill in using apparent praise of "honourable" Brutus to actually undermine him through increasingly obvious sarcasm.[^84]

> "My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, And I must pause till it come back to me."

This Shakespearean line captures the emotional power attributed to Antony's funeral speech, which reportedly moved the Roman crowd to outrage against the conspirators.[^85]

While Shakespeare's version has become the most famous representation of Antony's oratory, ancient sources confirm that Antony's actual funeral speech was a masterpiece of persuasion. According to historical accounts, Antony's oration was "intended not only to praise Caesar but more importantly to render as targets of public outrage the men his amnesty had only recently rescued from catastrophe."[^86]

The historical Antony's true words have been lost to time, but his rhetorical ability was acknowledged even by his enemy Cicero, who recognized Antony as a capable orator despite denouncing his character and judgment. The power of Antony's public speaking—demonstrated both at Caesar's funeral and in his military addresses—was one of his most important political tools throughout his career.
