## Summary

Nikolai Vavilov was a Russian botanist and geneticist who identified the centers of origin of cultivated plants and assembled the world's largest collection of plant seeds. He proposed the law of homologous series in variation. During Stalin's era, his genetics research conflicted with Lysenko's pseudoscience, leading to his arrest and death from starvation in prison.
