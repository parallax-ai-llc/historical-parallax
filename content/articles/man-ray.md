## Summary

Man Ray was an American artist who contributed to both the Dada and Surrealist movements in Paris. He pioneered artistic photography through techniques like the rayograph (camera-less photography) and solarization. His portraits of Paris's avant-garde and his experimental images made him the most important photographer of the modernist era.
