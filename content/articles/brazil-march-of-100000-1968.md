## Summary

On June 26, 1968, an estimated 100,000 Brazilians filled the streets of Rio de Janeiro in the largest protest against the military dictatorship since the 1964 coup. The Passeata dos Cem Mil (March of the 100,000) united students, artists, intellectuals, workers, and religious leaders demanding an end to state violence, the restoration of democracy, and the release of political prisoners. The march followed months of escalating confrontation, including the police killing of student Edson Luís and the bloody repression of "Sexta-feira Sangrenta" (Bloody Friday).[^1]

The peaceful demonstration represented the zenith of resistance to Brazil's military regime—and provoked its most severe response. Within months, the hardliners triumphed. On December 13, 1968, the government issued Institutional Act Number 5 (AI-5), suspending habeas corpus, closing Congress, intensifying censorship, and beginning the "Anos de Chumbo" (Years of Lead)—the dictatorship's most brutal phase. What might have been Brazil's democratization became its darkest hour.[^2]

## Historical Background

### The Military Dictatorship (1964-1985)

Brazil's 21-year military regime began with the 1964 coup:

- **April 1, 1964:** Military overthrew President João Goulart
- **Justification:** Preventing "communism"; maintaining "order"
- **Reality:** Authoritarian rule; political repression; economic development for some
- **By 1968:** Growing opposition; students increasingly vocal[^3]

### 1968: Year of Global Revolt

Brazil's protests echoed worldwide uprising:
- France (May 1968)
- Czechoslovakia (Prague Spring)
- USA (anti-Vietnam War protests)
- Mexico (Tlatelolco)

Students were the vanguard everywhere.[^4]

### Edson Luís (March 1968)

**March 28, 1968:** Police raided the Calabouço restaurant in Rio, a gathering spot for working-class students

**Edson Luís de Lima Souto**, 18, was shot and killed by military police

His death ignited fury:
- 50,000 attended his funeral
- Nationwide protests erupted
- Regime responded with more violence[^5]

### Sexta-feira Sangrenta (June 21)

**June 21, 1968:** "Bloody Friday"
- Students clashed with police in Rio
- Several killed
- Many injured and arrested
- The march of 100,000 came five days later[^6]

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Democratic High Point:** The March of 100,000 showed that opposition to the dictatorship was broad, deep, and growing. Students, workers, artists, and the middle class united. For a moment, democratic restoration seemed possible.[^9]

### Critical Perspective

**Regime Response:** The march terrified the military's hardliners. Rather than leading to compromise, the demonstration accelerated repression. The regime concluded that opposition must be crushed, not accommodated.

### AI-5 and the Years of Lead

**December 13, 1968:** Institutional Act Number 5 (AI-5) issued

**AI-5 provisions:**
- Suspended habeas corpus for political crimes
- Closed Congress
- Allowed removal of elected officials
- Intensified censorship
- Authorized arbitrary arrests and torture

The "Anos de Chumbo" (Years of Lead) began—the dictatorship's most violent phase, lasting until the late 1970s.[^10]

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate

- AI-5 crushed the opposition movement
- Mass arrests; torture widespread
- Artists forced into exile (Gil, Veloso, others)
- Student movement destroyed
- Armed resistance emerged (eventually defeated)

### Long-Term

**1974-1985:** Gradual, controlled opening ("distensão" and "abertura")
**1985:** Civilian government restored
**1988:** New democratic constitution

The March of 100,000 is remembered as the last great peaceful protest before the darkness.[^11]

## Legacy

### For Brazil

- June 26 commemorated
- Symbol of democratic resistance
- Part of the memory of dictatorship
- Informs contemporary politics

### For Democracy

- Showed power of mass peaceful protest
- Also showed limits when facing determined authoritarian response
- Parallel to other 1968 movements worldwide

### Unfinished Justice

Unlike some countries, Brazil never fully prosecuted military-era human rights violations. The 1979 amnesty law protected perpetrators. The memory of 1968—both the hope of the march and the horror of AI-5—remains contested.[^12]
