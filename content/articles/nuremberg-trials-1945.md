## Overview

The Nuremberg Trials (1945-1949) were the most significant war crimes tribunals in history. Following Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II, the victorious Allied powers established an International Military Tribunal (IMT) in Nuremberg to prosecute surviving Nazi leaders for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity—a term coined for these proceedings. The main trial (1945-1946) tried 22 major war criminals, resulting in 12 death sentences. The trials established revolutionary principles: individuals are responsible for their actions even when obeying orders, and crimes against humanity are punishable by international law. Nuremberg laid the foundation for modern international criminal justice.

## Background

### Why Nuremberg?

**Symbolic:**
- Site of Nazi Party rallies
- City of Nazi racial laws (Nuremberg Laws, 1935)
- One of few German cities with intact courthouse

### Why a Trial?

**Debate:**
- Churchill initially favored summary execution of Nazi leaders
- Stalin suggested show trials (Soviet style)
- U.S. (Henry Stimson, Robert Jackson) argued for judicial process

**Chosen Approach:**
Fair trial would demonstrate Allied moral superiority, document Nazi crimes, and establish legal precedent.

## Legal Significance

### Precedents Established

**Individual Responsibility:**
Individuals, not just states, can be held accountable.

**"Just Following Orders" Rejected:**
Obedience to superior orders is not a defense for atrocities.

**Crimes Against Humanity:**
Recognized as international crime regardless of domestic law.

**Aggressive War:**
Planning or waging aggressive war is punishable.

### Criticisms

**Victor's Justice:**
Only Axis crimes tried. Allied bombing of civilians, Soviet actions not addressed.

**Ex Post Facto:**
Some charges for crimes defined after acts committed.

**Soviet Participation:**
USSR committed similar crimes (Katyn massacre denied).

### Despite Criticisms

Generally regarded as fair for the era. Evidence overwhelming. Most historians view as justified.
