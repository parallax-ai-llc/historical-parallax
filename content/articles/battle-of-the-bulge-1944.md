## Overview

The Battle of the Bulge (December 16, 1944 – January 25, 1945) was Hitler's last major offensive campaign on the Western Front. Codenamed **Operation Watch on the Rhine**, the goal was to split the British and American Allied line in half, capture the key supply port of Antwerp, and force a negotiated peace. Taking advantage of overcast skies (grounding Allied aircraft), three German armies smashed into the thinly held Ardennes sector. The "Bulge" refers to the deep incurson into the Allied line on maps. It became the largest and bloodiest single battle fought by the United States in World War II.

## Key Engagements

### 1. The Breakthrough (Dec 16)
Germans achieved total surprise.
US 106th Division surrounded in the Schnee Eifel: 7,000 men surrendered (largest US surrender in Europe).

### 2. Malmedy Massacre (Dec 17)
Joachim Peiper's SS unit captured ~113 US soldiers (Battery B, 285th Field Artillery).
Gunned them down in a field. 84 died. Survivors spread the word.
**Effect:** US troops stopped taking SS prisoners.

### 3. Siege of Bastogne (Dec 20-27)
Crucial road junction.
**Defenders:** 101st Airborne ("Screaming Eagles") + elements of 10th Armored.
**Conditions:** Surrounded. No winter gear. Low ammo. Fog prevented airops.
**The Surrender Demand (Dec 22):** German General Lüttwitz sent ultimatum.
**The Reply:** Gen. Anthony McAuliffe sent a typed one-word response: **"NUTS!"**
(Germans were confused. US officer explained: "It means go to hell.").

### 4. Patton's Prayer (Dec 26)
General George Patton executed a complex 90-degree turn of his Third Army in 48 hours.
"I can attack with three divisions in 48 hours." (Eisenhower thought he was boasting).
Tank column broke the siege of Bastogne.

Skies cleared. Allied air power (Typhoons/Thunderbolts) destroyed exposed German columns.
Germans ran out of fuel. Abandoned tanks.

## Analysis

**German Failure:**
1.  **Fuel:** Relied on capturing Allied fuel dumps. Failed.
2.  **Weather:** Relied on bad weather. When sun came out, Panzers were sitting ducks.
3.  **Resistance:** Critical delays at St. Vith and Bastogne (e.g. Sgt. Kinney's squad holding a road for a day) ruined the strict timetable.

**Significance:**
Exhausted Germany's last reserves. The road to Berlin was now open.
