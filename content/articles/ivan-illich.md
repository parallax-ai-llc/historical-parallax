## Summary

Ivan Illich was a Croatian-Austrian Catholic priest and social critic who challenged modern institutions including schools, hospitals, and churches. His books Deschooling Society and Medical Nemesis argued that modern institutions often undermine the goals they claim to serve. His theological writings explored how the institutionalization of Christian charity corrupted its original spirit. He was one of the most provocative Catholic intellectuals of the 20th century.
