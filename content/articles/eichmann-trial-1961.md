## Overview

Adolf Eichmann was the Nazi bureaucratic genius who organized the logistics of the Holocaust (the trains). He escaped to Argentina after the war. In 1960, **Mossad** agents captured him in Buenos Aires and smuggled him to Israel. His trial in Jerusalem was a global media event. For the first time, Holocaust survivors testified openly to the world, breaking years of silence. Eichmann sat in a bulletproof glass booth, looking not like a monster, but like a boring, balding bureaucrat.

## The Capture (Operation Finale)

Mossad received a tip from a blind man in Argentina whose daughter was dating Eichmann's son.
Agents snatched him near his home on Garibaldi Street.
They sedated him, dressed him in an El Al flight attendant uniform, and flew him out.

## The Banality of Evil

Philosopher **Hannah Arendt** covered the trial for *The New Yorker*.
She expected a fanatic. She found a man who spoke in clichés and claimed he was "just following orders."
She coined the phrase **"The Banality of Evil"**—the idea that great evil is not always committed by sociopaths, but by ordinary people who stop thinking and blindly follow bureaucratic systems.
(This remains controversial; later evidence suggests Eichmann was actually a fanatical anti-Semite, not just a cog).

## The Verdict

Eichmann was convicted of crimes against humanity and war crimes.
**Execution:**
He was hanged on May 31, 1962.
His body was cremated, and his ashes were scattered in the Mediterranean Sea, outside Israeli territorial waters, so he would have no resting place.
He is the only person ever executed by the State of Israel civil courts.
