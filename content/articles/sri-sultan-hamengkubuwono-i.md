## Summary

Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (born Raden Mas Sujana, later known as Prince Mangkubumi; 5 August 1717 – 24 March 1792) was the founder and first sultan of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, reigning from 1755 to 1792.[^1] A brilliant military commander, skilled diplomat, and visionary architect, he emerged from the chaos of the Third Javanese War of Succession to establish one of Java's most enduring cultural and political institutions.[^2] Through persistent military campaigns against rival factions and the Dutch East India Company (VOC), he secured recognition as ruler of southern Mataram territories via the Treaty of Giyanti on 13 February 1755.[^3] Elevated to National Hero of Indonesia in 2006, Hamengkubuwono I is remembered for his resistance against Dutch colonial interference and for creating a sultanate that remains a vital center of Javanese culture to this day.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Bendara Raden Mas Sujono, later known as Pangeran Mangkubumi and ultimately Sultan Hamengkubuwono I, was born on 5 August 1717 in Kartasura, the capital of the Mataram Sultanate.[^5] He was the son of Sultan Amangkurat IV (also known as Sultan Mangkurat IV) and his concubine Mas Ayu Tejawati, positioning him within the complex web of Mataram royal succession but not as a direct heir to the throne.[^6] His birth came during a period of significant instability for the Mataram Sultanate, as internal succession conflicts and increasing Dutch East India Company (VOC) interventions progressively weakened the kingdom's central authority.[^7]

Following his father's death in 1726, when Sujono was only nine years old, he was raised amid the intricate court politics and ancient traditions of Mataram under the oversight of subsequent rulers, including his half-brother Pakubuwono II who succeeded their father.[^8] The young prince received an education befitting Javanese nobility, learning statecraft, military tactics, courtly etiquette, and the syncretic Javanese-Islamic traditions that characterized the Mataram court.[^9] This upbringing in the shadow of the throne, combined with his observation of the growing Dutch interference in Javanese affairs, would profoundly shape his later political and military career.

The genealogical records show that Sultan Hamengkubuwono I descended from a distinguished lineage tracing back to Sultan Agung, the third Sultan of Mataram who ruled from 1613 to 1645 and expanded the kingdom to its greatest territorial extent.[^10] This connection to Sultan Agung's legacy would later influence Hamengkubuwono I's vision of himself as the inheritor of Mataram's greatness and his lifelong ambition to restore the kingdom to wholeness.[^11] Growing up during the reign of Pakubuwono II, the young prince witnessed firsthand the devastating Chinese rebellion of 1742, when Chinese mercenaries led by Raden Mas Garendi (Sunan Kuning) captured Kartasura on 30 June 1742, forcing Pakubuwono II to flee.[^12] This traumatic event, which saw the palace destroyed and eventually led to the capital's relocation to Surakarta (Solo) in 1745-1746, demonstrated both the fragility of central authority and the opportunities that chaos could present to ambitious princes.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Prince Mangkubumi's rise to power emerged from a complex web of succession disputes, Dutch colonial interference, and armed rebellion that engulfed the Mataram Sultanate in the mid-eighteenth century. The immediate catalyst came when Governor-General van Imhoff humiliated Prince Mangkubumi by demanding the lease of the Javanese northern coast for an annual payment of 20,000 reales, and then conspired with Patih Pringgalaya to persuade Pakubuwana II to cancel the grant of a fief in Sukawati (now Sragen) that had been promised to Mangkubumi as a reward for defeating Raden Mas Said's rebellion in 1746.[^14] This betrayal proved to be the breaking point for the prince.

In 1747, Prince Mangkubumi began his opposition to Pakubuwana II over these succession problems and the king's increasing collaboration with the VOC.[^15] After leaving Surakarta, Mangkubumi joined forces with his nephew and former enemy, Raden Mas Said (later Mangkunegara I), creating a powerful alliance strengthened when Princess Bendara, daughter of Mangkubumi, married Mangkunegara.[^16] This coalition launched what became known as the Third Javanese War of Succession, which would rage across Central Java from 1746 to 1757 (though some sources date its beginning as early as 1746 or its conclusion in 1755 for the main conflict).[^17]

Prince Mangkubumi proved to be a brilliant military tactician during this protracted conflict. He achieved significant victories in battles at Grobogan and Demak, and most notably destroyed Dutch commander De Clerck and his entire force at the Bogowonto River (also called River Bagawanta) in 1751, inflicting a crushing defeat on VOC forces.[^18] With Dutch forces divided by simultaneous uprisings and Mangkubumi controlling much of southwestern Java, he was able to advance his territorial claims and build a base of popular support in the region.[^19] His military successes demonstrated not only his tactical abilities but also his capacity to mobilize Javanese forces against both indigenous rivals and European colonial powers.

When Pakubuwana II fell ill in 1749, he called his trusted friend van Hohendorff and asked him to assume control over the kingdom.[^20] On 11 December 1749, in a controversial act that shocked many Javanese nobles, Pakubuwana II signed an agreement transferring the "sovereignty" of Mataram to the VOC.[^21] Nine days later, on 20 December 1749, Pakubuwana II died, and on 15 December his son was announced as Pakubuwana III.[^22] However, Prince Mangkubumi refused to recognize this transfer of sovereignty to the Dutch Company or the legitimacy of Pakubuwana III's succession, viewing both as illegitimate due to VOC interference.[^23] In response, on 12 December 1749, Mangkubumi, with full support from Raden Mas Said, proclaimed himself as the rival King or Sultan and established a competing government in Yogyakarta, even initially using the title Pakubuwono III himself, creating a dualism of power in Mataram.[^24]

The war continued for several more years, but eventually military stalemate and Dutch desire to end the costly conflict led Governor-General Mossel to enter peace negotiations.[^25] However, in 1752, the coalition between Raden Mas Said and Prince Mangkubumi broke down due to disputes over single undivided supremacy over Mataram, and Mangkubumi even waged war against his own son-in-law.[^26] Not until 1755 did Mangkubumi break away from Raden Mas Said and accept a peace offer at Giyanti.[^27] On 13 February 1755, the Treaty of Giyanti was signed at the village of Giyanti near Surakarta, officially dividing the Mataram Sultanate into two entities: the Surakarta Sunanate under Pakubuwono III in the northeast, and the Yogyakarta Sultanate under Mangkubumi—who adopted the title Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono I—in the southwest.[^28] The newly crowned sultan officially founded his sultanate on 7 October 1756, establishing his court in Yogyakarta and beginning a reign that would last until his death in 1792.[^29]

## Major Achievements

### Foundation of the Yogyakarta Sultanate

Sultan Hamengkubuwono I's most significant achievement was the establishment of the Yogyakarta Sultanate itself as an independent political entity that would endure for centuries. Through his military prowess and diplomatic acumen, he secured the Treaty of Giyanti's favorable terms, which gave him control over the western half of Mataram, including half of the palace heirlooms, half of the royal treasury and population, and half of the compensation from Dutch control of the north coast territories.[^30] The division was meticulously detailed, covering not only territorial boundaries but also aspects of royal regalia, court traditions, and governance structures.[^31] This created a distinct Javanese kingdom that persists as a major cultural center in Central Java to this day, with Yogyakarta holding special autonomous status within modern Indonesia.

### Architectural and Urban Planning Legacy

Hamengkubuwono I distinguished himself as a visionary architect and urban planner. As the chief architect, he personally designed and oversaw the construction of the Keraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat, the royal palace complex that would serve as the sultanate's political, cultural, and spiritual center.[^32] Construction began in 1755 shortly after the Treaty of Giyanti and was largely completed by 1756.[^33] The sultan moved his court from Kuta Gede to the site he renamed Yogyakarta, demonstrating his ambition to create a new center of Javanese civilization.[^34]

The Kraton's design reflected Hamengkubuwono I's sophisticated understanding of Javanese cosmology and philosophy. He developed a city layout based on a six-kilometer north-south cosmological axis positioned to link Mount Merapi (to the north), considered the abode of Guardian Spirits, with the Indian Ocean to the south, regarded as the home of Kanjeng Ratu Loro Kidul (the Queen of the Southern Sea).[^35] The Kraton itself was placed at the center of this axis, symbolizing the sultan's role as mediator between the divine, human, and natural realms.[^36] This orientation manifested in physical form several Javanese philosophical concepts: Sangkan Paraning Dumadi (the cycle of life), Hamemayu Hayuning Bawana (ideal harmonious life), Manunggaling Kawula Gusti (the connection between human beings and the Creator), and the relationship between microcosmic and macrocosmic worlds.[^37] The axis also represented the five elements—fire (dahana) from Mount Merapi, earth (bantala) from Yogyakarta, water (tirta) from the South Sea, wind (maruta), and ether (angkasa)—embodying the Javanese belief in maintaining harmony between humanity, nature, and the divine.[^38] This cosmological axis was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in September 2023, testament to its enduring significance.[^39]

His architectural expertise was appreciated by Dutch scientists Theodoor Gautier Thomas Pigeaud and Lucien Adam, who considered him a worthy successor of Pakubuwono II in architectural achievement.[^40] Sultan Hamengkubuwono I had traveled twice to Batavia to learn about European architecture, which explains why some of his designs incorporated European stylistic elements alongside traditional Javanese forms.[^41]

In 1758 (1684 Javanese year), Hamengkubuwono I commanded the Regent to supervise the making of bricks and various construction materials for an ambitious new project.[^42] Construction began in 1758 under the supervision of a Portuguese architect, and in 1765, he commissioned the completion of the Taman Sari complex, a sprawling water garden and bathing pavilion covering approximately 12 hectares and consisting of about 59 buildings including a mosque, meditation chambers, swimming pools, and a series of 18 water gardens and pavilions surrounded by artificial lakes.[^43] Known as the "Fragrant Garden," Taman Sari functioned as a private retreat for the sultan and his family, integrating sophisticated hydraulic engineering with aesthetic beauty and ritual purposes.[^44] The architecture reflected a distinctive blend of Javanese and European architectural styles, demonstrating the sultan's cosmopolitan vision.[^45] The complex was effectively used between 1765 and 1812, when it suffered considerable damage during the British invasion of the Yogyakarta Kraton.[^46]

### Cultural Patronage and Preservation

Hamengkubuwono I fostered traditional Javanese arts, establishing Yogyakarta as a new center of Javanese identity and Islamic culture.[^47] He provided generous patronage to gamelan music, wayang (shadow puppetry), and batik motifs, creating an environment where literature and performing arts flourished.[^48] Shadow puppetry (wayang kulit), one of Java's most famous traditional art forms, received special attention during his reign.[^49] His specific artistic legacies include the creation of Beksan Lawung (a ceremonial dance), the Wayang Wong dance drama Gondowerdaya, Tarian Eteng, and developments in the art of Wayang Purwo.[^50]

In 1785, the sultan issued an edict restricting certain symbolic batik motifs, such as the parang pattern, to nobility as markers of elite identity.[^51] This regulation both preserved the sacred status of certain designs and reinforced the social hierarchy that characterized traditional Javanese society. Under his leadership, Yogyakarta emerged as a repository of Javanese cultural traditions that might otherwise have been lost during the tumultuous mid-eighteenth century, ensuring that gamelan, batik, wayang kulit, and other art forms remained central to Javanese identity.[^52]

### Administrative and Legal Reforms

The sultanate upheld Mataram's syncretic system blending Islamic sharia with Javanese adat (customary law), with the sultan exercising apex authority in dispute resolution and issuing edicts.[^53] Hamengkubuwono I's governance emphasized customary precedents to maintain social order in the post-division context, creating stability after decades of civil strife.[^54] Administrative reforms under his reign included the establishment of a centralized bureaucracy that balanced traditional Javanese hierarchies with efficient revenue collection.[^55] These innovations are credited with fostering economic recovery through land reclamation and irrigation projects, which stabilized the realm after the devastation of the succession wars.[^56]

Though specific documentation of a "Yogyakarta Code 1775" was not located in available sources, historical records reference traditional legal codes such as the "Angger Ageng" and later the "Serat Angger Pradata" that codified regulations based on Mataram Kingdom traditions, suggesting that Hamengkubuwono I did establish foundational legal and fiscal structures during his reign.[^57]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Collaboration with Colonial Powers

Despite his reputation as a fighter against Dutch domination, Sultan Hamengkubuwono I's relationship with the VOC was complex and often pragmatic rather than consistently adversarial. The Treaty of Giyanti itself was a negotiated settlement with the Dutch, and accepting the division of Mataram could be seen as abandoning the goal of reunifying the historic kingdom that his ancestor Sultan Agung had built.[^58] Although Hamengkubuwono I is said to have continued striving to restore the kingdom inherited from Sultan Agung to wholeness, the reality is that he ruled only half of the divided realm and maintained diplomatic relations with the VOC throughout his reign.[^59]

The newly-formed Sultanate under Sultan Hamengkubuwono I retained formal autonomy, but the Dutch under the VOC heavily influenced the sultanate's political decisions.[^60] VOC expanded its presence in Java by stationing Dutch residents at the Kraton (Royal Palace) to serve as advisors who effectively dictated key political and military matters.[^61] The construction of Fort Vredeburg (originally Fort Rustenburg) in 1760, just five years after the sultanate's founding, symbolized this Dutch oversight—a colonial military installation built to monitor the sultan's activities, euphemistically named "Peace Fort" but functioning as a tool of colonial surveillance.[^62] Critics might argue that Hamengkubuwono I's acceptance of this arrangement, rather than continuing armed resistance, represented a compromise of Javanese independence.

### Dynastic Conflicts and Nepotism

The breakdown of Hamengkubuwono I's alliance with Raden Mas Said in 1752, driven by disputes over supremacy, led to armed conflict between the former allies, with Mangkubumi even turning against his own son-in-law.[^63] This bitter falling out, which occurred just three years before the Treaty of Giyanti, suggests that personal ambition and dynastic rivalry took precedence over united Javanese resistance to Dutch interference. The subsequent partition that gave Raden Mas Said only a small southeastern territory as the Mangkunegara principality in 1757—significantly less than the Sultanates of Yogyakarta and Surakarta—reflected Hamengkubuwono I's willingness to marginalize former allies to secure his own position.[^64]

Hamengkubuwono I's succession planning also contained elements of dynastic difficulty. He designated his son Gusti Raden Mas Enta (son of GKR Kencana) as heir-apparent with the title Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Adipati Anom Hamengkunegara Sudibya Rajaputra Narendra ing Mataram, but the prince died young.[^65] Eventually, his fifth son, Raden Mas Sundara (Sundoro), born in 1750, was recognized as crown prince in the Treaty of Giyanti and succeeded him as Hamengkubuwono II.[^66] However, Hamengkubuwono II's troubled reign included three separate periods of rule (1792-1810, 1811-1812, and 1826-1828) marked by British intervention and internal instability, suggesting that Hamengkubuwono I's succession arrangements did not ensure political continuity.[^67]

### Territorial Concessions and Limited Sovereignty

The Treaty of Giyanti's provisions included significant territorial concessions that diminished the sultanate's economic independence. The north coast of Java (the Pasisir region), which had been a vital source of trade revenue for the Mataram Sultanate, remained in Dutch East India Company hands, with only half of the compensation for this control given to Mangkubumi.[^68] This arrangement made the new sultanate economically dependent on Dutch goodwill and trade arrangements from its inception. The meticulously detailed division of palace heirlooms, royal regalia, treasury, and even population could be interpreted as accepting the fragmentation of Javanese power rather than pursuing genuine independence.[^69]

### Legacy of Division

While Hamengkubuwono I is celebrated for establishing Yogyakarta's distinct identity, critics could argue that by accepting the permanent division of Mataram, he institutionalized Javanese political fragmentation that made the region more vulnerable to colonial domination. The creation of two rival courts at Yogyakarta and Surakarta, later joined by the smaller Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman principalities, meant that Javanese political energy was often directed toward inter-court rivalries rather than unified resistance to Dutch expansion.[^70] Although there were later instances of cooperation between the courts, such as the 1757 Treaty of Salatiga and twentieth-century collaboration during Indonesia's independence struggle, the fundamental division persisted and arguably weakened Javanese bargaining power vis-à-vis colonial authorities.[^71]

## Personal Life

Sultan Hamengkubuwono I maintained a complex household with multiple wives, as was customary for Javanese royalty of his era. His principal wives included Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Kencana (daughter of Bendara Pangeran Harya Dipanegara, son of Pakubuwana I of Surakarta), Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Kadipaten (daughter of Kyai Ageng Drepayuda), and Bendara Raden Ayu Srenggara (daughter of Tumenggung Natayudha of Kedu).[^72] His eventual successor, Hamengkubuwono II, was born on 7 March 1750 to Ratu Hageng and was recognized as crown prince in the 1755 Treaty of Giyanti when he was only five years old, demonstrating the importance of securing dynastic succession even during the founding negotiations of the sultanate.[^73]

The sultan's personal philosophy reflected a distinctive synthesis of Islamic monotheism and Javanese cosmological beliefs. In designing the royal palace, Hamengkubuwono I incorporated concepts adapted from Hindu-Buddhist traditions that communicated the relationship between God and all creation.[^74] He believed that humans occupy the same level as other living creatures and therefore emphasized treating all beings equally, as God sees everyone the same way.[^75] Simultaneously, as a Muslim, he integrated Islamic philosophies into the royal palace design and governance, creating the syncretic religious culture that characterizes Javanese Islam.[^76] This philosophical approach reflected the broader Mataram tradition of blending Islamic sharia with Javanese adat customs, positioning the sultan as both a religious leader (as defender of Islam) and a cosmic mediator in the Javanese worldview.[^77]

Historical sources characterize Sultan Hamengkubuwono I as a commander, statesman, and leader of the people, suggesting a ruler who commanded respect through both military prowess and governance skills.[^78] His twice-repeated journeys to Batavia to study European architecture demonstrate intellectual curiosity and willingness to incorporate foreign knowledge when it could benefit his kingdom.[^79] His sustained military campaigns from 1746 to 1755, followed by 37 years of relatively stable rule until his death in 1792, indicate remarkable physical endurance and political acumen—he lived to age 74 or 75 in an era when such longevity was uncommon, particularly for military leaders.[^80]

The name "Hamengkubuwono" that he adopted carries profound philosophical significance. The title derives from classical Javanese linguistic elements, combining "hamengku" (connoting guardianship, protection, or possession) with "buwono" or "buwana" (meaning world, universe, or cosmos—a term traceable to Sanskrit "bhuvana" via Old Javanese influences).[^81] This etymology yields interpretations such as "holder of the universe," "controller of the universe," or "He who holds the world," symbolizing the sultan's role as cosmic steward and maintainer of harmony between earthly and divine realms in the Javanese worldview.[^82] The phrasing parallels Surakarta's title "Pakubuwono" ("nail of the cosmos"), underscoring a shared paradigm of rulers as pivotal axes in the universal order.[^83]

## Legacy

### Enduring Political Institution

Sultan Hamengkubuwono I's most profound legacy is the Yogyakarta Sultanate itself, which has endured for more than 270 years since its founding in 1755. Unlike most traditional monarchies that were abolished during Indonesia's independence and modernization, the Yogyakarta Sultanate retained its authority and in 1950 was granted special autonomous status (Daerah Istimewa) within the Republic of Indonesia, the only region in Indonesia with such a designation.[^84] The sultan continues to serve as the hereditary governor of the Yogyakarta Special Region, making it a unique example of a functioning monarchy within a republican system. This extraordinary arrangement testifies to the strength of the institutional foundations that Hamengkubuwono I established and the deep cultural legitimacy that the sultanate commands among the Javanese people.

### Cultural Preservation and Identity

Yogyakarta remains the heart of Javanese cultural preservation, serving as a repository for traditional arts, language, court rituals, and spiritual practices that might otherwise have disappeared in the face of modernization and globalization.[^85] The Kraton continues to function as a center of traditional arts, with regular performances of gamelan music, wayang kulit shadow puppetry, and classical Javanese dance that trace their patronage directly to Hamengkubuwono I's support in the eighteenth century.[^86] The batik traditions that he promoted and regulated have become recognized as UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, with Yogyakarta remaining one of Indonesia's premier centers for batik production.[^87] The Keraton itself stands as a living museum, containing collections of royal artifacts and maintaining court traditions that provide tangible links to eighteenth-century Javanese civilization.[^88]

### Architectural and Urban Heritage

The cosmological axis of Yogyakarta that Hamengkubuwono I designed in the eighteenth century was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in September 2023 as "The Cosmological Axis of Yogyakarta and its Historic Landmarks," acknowledging its outstanding universal value as a physical manifestation of Javanese philosophical thought and its continuous spiritual significance over more than 260 years.[^89] The six-kilometer axis linking Mount Merapi, the Kraton, and the Indian Ocean continues to shape Yogyakarta's urban development and spiritual practices, with key cultural monuments along the axis connected through rituals that persist to the present day.[^90] The Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat remains largely intact and continues to serve as both a royal residence and a representation of the Javanese universe according to cosmological principles.[^91]

Taman Sari, despite suffering damage during the 1812 British invasion and subsequent earthquakes, remains a significant historical site and tourist attraction, testament to Hamengkubuwono I's architectural vision and the sophisticated hydraulic engineering of eighteenth-century Java.[^92] The royal cemetery at Imogiri, where Hamengkubuwono I was buried on 24 March 1792, continues to serve as the traditional resting place for Yogyakarta and Surakarta royalty, with pilgrims ascending exactly 409 steps to the tomb complex, maintaining ritual practices established in Sultan Agung's era and continued through Hamengkubuwono I's time.[^93]

### National Recognition

In 2006, more than 200 years after his death, Sultan Hamengkubuwono I was officially elevated to the status of National Hero of Indonesia (Pahlawan Nasional) in recognition of his fight against the Dutch at that time and his establishment of Yogyakarta.[^94] This posthumous honor places him alongside other Indonesian independence fighters and nation-builders, acknowledging his role in resisting colonial domination and preserving Javanese sovereignty during the eighteenth century. His elevation to National Hero status reflects modern Indonesia's recognition that regional leaders who maintained indigenous political institutions against colonial pressure made vital contributions to the nation's eventual independence.

### Inspiration for Later Resistance

Although Hamengkubuwono I himself maintained complex diplomatic relations with the Dutch, his establishment of an independent sultanate and his early military resistance inspired later generations of Javanese leaders. Most notably, the Java War of 1825-1830, led by Prince Diponegoro (grandson of Hamengkubuwono III and great-great-grandson of Hamengkubuwono I), represented a continuation of Javanese armed resistance to Dutch colonialism, with Diponegoro framing his guerrilla warfare as jihad and mobilizing popular support across Central Java.[^95] During Indonesia's twentieth-century independence struggle, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX (a direct descendant) provided crucial support to the Republican cause, offering Yogyakarta as the national capital when Jakarta fell to Dutch forces, demonstrating how the sultanate's tradition of asserting Javanese interests against colonial powers continued across centuries.[^96]

### Precedent for Javanese Strategic Culture

Scholars have identified how Javanese values and historical experiences significantly shape Indonesia's strategic culture, with Javanese dominance in military and political spheres persisting into modern times (76% of senior officers being Javanese).[^97] Hamengkubuwono I's combination of armed resistance, diplomatic negotiation, and institutional preservation can be seen as establishing a template for Javanese political strategy that balanced principled opposition to foreign domination with pragmatic accommodation when necessary to preserve core interests and cultural identity.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters recognize Sultan Hamengkubuwono I as a multifaceted leader whose accomplishments extended far beyond military conquest. Historians emphasize his role as a skilled military strategist who achieved significant victories against both indigenous rivals and Dutch colonial forces, most notably the crushing defeat of Dutch commander De Clerck at the Bogowonto River in 1751, which demonstrated that European military forces were not invincible in Javanese terrain.[^98] His ability to sustain a military campaign for nearly a decade (1746-1755) while building political support across southwestern Java speaks to both his tactical abilities and his capacity to articulate a vision of legitimate Javanese sovereignty that resonated with local populations.[^99]

Cultural historians celebrate Hamengkubuwono I's extraordinary contributions to Javanese arts and architecture. Dutch scientists Theodoor Gautier Thomas Pigeaud and Lucien Adam considered him a worthy successor of Pakubuwono II in architectural achievement, recognizing his sophistication in urban planning and design.[^100] Modern scholars note that his role as chief architect of both the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat and the Taman Sari complex demonstrated a remarkable integration of aesthetic beauty, religious symbolism, practical engineering, and political meaning.[^101] The UNESCO recognition of Yogyakarta's cosmological axis in 2023 validates scholarly assessments that Hamengkubuwono I created an urban landscape of outstanding universal value that physically manifests Javanese philosophical concepts about the relationship between humanity, nature, and the divine.[^102]

Defenders of his legacy emphasize the extraordinary achievement of establishing a political and cultural institution that has endured for more than 270 years and continues to hold a unique position in modern Indonesia. The Sultanate of Yogyakarta's survival through Dutch colonialism, Japanese occupation, Indonesia's revolutionary period, and modernization represents a remarkable feat of institutional resilience that reflects the solid foundations Hamengkubuwono I established.[^103] His synthesis of Islamic and Javanese traditions, his support for traditional arts, and his establishment of governance structures that balanced efficiency with cultural legitimacy created a model of indigenous statecraft that proved remarkably durable.[^104]

Contemporary assessments within Indonesia recognize Hamengkubuwono I as representing the greatest king from the Mataram family since Sultan Agung, acknowledging his military prowess, diplomatic skill, and cultural contributions.[^105] His elevation to National Hero status in 2006 reflects a national consensus that his resistance to Dutch domination and his preservation of Javanese political and cultural institutions made vital contributions to Indonesian national identity and eventual independence.[^106] The fact that Yogyakarta remains Indonesia's only Special Autonomous Region with a hereditary governor demonstrates the continued legitimacy of the political arrangements that Hamengkubuwono I established in the eighteenth century.[^107]

### Negative Views

Critical scholars and historians question whether Hamengkubuwono I's legacy represents genuine resistance to colonialism or rather a pragmatic accommodation that ultimately facilitated Dutch control over Java. The Treaty of Giyanti, rather than being a victory for Javanese independence, permanently divided the Mataram Sultanate and created rival courts whose competition weakened collective Javanese bargaining power against colonial authorities.[^108] Critics note that by accepting Dutch mediation and territorial division, Hamengkubuwono I prioritized his personal dynastic ambitions over Javanese unity, abandoning the goal of restoring the unified kingdom that his illustrious ancestor Sultan Agung had built.[^109]

Skeptics point to the substantial Dutch influence over the newly established sultanate as evidence that formal sovereignty masked de facto colonial control. The stationing of Dutch residents at the Kraton to serve as "advisors" who dictated key political and military matters, and the construction of Fort Vredeburg in 1760 as a colonial monitoring station, indicate that Hamengkubuwono I ruled within significant constraints imposed by the VOC.[^110] The sultanate's economic dependence on Dutch-controlled coastal trade and its acceptance of only half the compensation for Dutch possession of the lucrative north coast territories further limited genuine autonomy.[^111] From this perspective, Hamengkubuwono I's reign inaugurated not Javanese independence but rather a new phase of colonial indirect rule in which indigenous monarchs maintained ceremonial status while real power shifted to European administrators.

The breakdown of his alliance with Raden Mas Said in 1752 and the subsequent armed conflict between former allies reveals, in critical assessments, that personal ambition and dynastic rivalry took precedence over united resistance to colonialism.[^112] The marginalization of Mangkunegara I to a small southeastern territory in 1757, significantly inferior to the Yogyakarta and Surakarta sultanates, demonstrates how Hamengkubuwono I was willing to collaborate with Dutch authorities to diminish potential rivals rather than building a unified Javanese front.[^113] His complex web of marriages and succession arrangements, while typical of royal politics, also consumed energy that might have been directed toward challenging colonial structures.

Some historians question the portrayal of Hamengkubuwono I as consistently opposing Dutch domination, noting that his reign from 1755 to 1792 was characterized more by diplomatic engagement with the VOC than by continued armed resistance. After securing the Treaty of Giyanti, he focused primarily on consolidating his rule over the Yogyakarta territories, developing architecture and arts, and managing court affairs rather than challenging the broader colonial system.[^114] The relative stability of his 37-year reign, while beneficial for cultural development, might alternatively be interpreted as acquiescence to colonial arrangements. Later, more radical resistance movements, such as Prince Diponegoro's Java War of 1825-1830, could be seen as reactions to the inadequacy of the accommodationist approach that Hamengkubuwono I established.[^115]

## Famous Quotes

While specific recorded quotes directly attributed to Sultan Hamengkubuwono I are not extensively documented in available historical sources, his philosophical principles and governance approach were expressed through the design and symbolism of his architectural works and the establishment of legal-cultural frameworks:

> "The palace must embody the relationship between God and all creation, for our level as humans is the same with other living creatures—therefore it is important to treat others equally as God sees us all the same way." - Philosophical principle embodied in the Kraton design[^116]

This concept reflected his belief in cosmic harmony and social equity, integrated into the very architecture of the palace complex as a physical manifestation of Javanese cosmological principles.

> "Hamengku Buwono" (Holder of the Universe) - The title he chose for himself and his dynasty[^117]

The adoption of this title represented a philosophical statement about the sultan's role as cosmic steward and maintainer of harmony between earthly and divine realms, positioning the ruler as a pivotal axis in the universal order according to Javanese worldview.

> "The axis connecting Merapi, the Kraton, and the Southern Ocean embodies the harmony between fire, earth, and water—between the divine realm, the human realm, and the natural realm." - Cosmological principle underlying Yogyakarta's urban design[^118]

This concept, manifested in the physical layout of the city, demonstrated Hamengkubuwono I's sophisticated integration of spiritual meaning with practical urban planning, creating a sacred geography that continues to shape Yogyakarta's identity more than 260 years later.
