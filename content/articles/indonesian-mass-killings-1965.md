## Summary

The Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66 (pembantaian Indonesia 1965-1966) were an anti-communist purge that killed an estimated 500,000 to over 1 million people, making it one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century. Targeting members and alleged sympathizers of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI / Partai Komunis Indonesia), the violence was orchestrated by the Indonesian Army under General Suharto, carried out with the assistance of civilian militias, religious organizations, and death squads, and supported covertly by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia.[^1]

The bloodshed began following the mysterious "September 30 Movement" (Gerakan 30 September / G30S), an event in which six senior army generals were kidnapped and killed on the night of September 30-October 1, 1965. Though the circumstances remain disputed, the Army leadership immediately blamed the PKI—then the world's largest non-ruling communist party—and launched a nationwide campaign of extermination. Over the following months, communists and suspected leftists were systematically hunted, tortured, and killed, often by their neighbors. Bodies were dumped in rivers, thrown into wells, or buried in mass graves that remain unmarked to this day.[^2]

The massacres destroyed the PKI, eliminated the political left from Indonesian life, and enabled General Suharto to seize power from President Sukarno, establishing the authoritarian "New Order" (Orde Baru) regime that would rule Indonesia for 32 years until 1998. Despite the scale of the atrocities, no perpetrator has ever been brought to justice, and official acknowledgment remains limited. The killings are sometimes called Indonesia's "hidden genocide."[^3]

## Historical Background

### Sukarno's Indonesia

President Sukarno, a charismatic leader of the independence movement, had ruled Indonesia since independence in 1945. By the early 1960s, his government rested on a precarious balance between the three most powerful political forces:

- **The Army (ABRI):** Anti-communist, aligned with Western interests
- **The PKI:** With 3 million members and millions more in affiliated organizations, the largest communist party outside China and the USSR
- **Sukarno himself:** Who sought to balance these forces while maintaining personal power[^4]

### The Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI)

The PKI held a unique position:

- Not in government, but influential
- Strong among peasants, workers, intellectuals, and artists
- Affiliated organizations (Gerwani for women, BTI for peasants, LEKRA for artists) had millions of members
- Had pursued a legal, electoral path rather than armed revolution
- Deeply threatening to the Army, landowners, and religious conservatives[^5]

### Rising Tensions (1963-1965)

By 1965, tensions between the Army and PKI had reached a breaking point:

- Land reform campaigns put PKI in conflict with rural elites
- The PKI proposed arming peasants and workers (the "Fifth Force")
- The Army feared PKI ascendancy if Sukarno died or retired
- Cold War pressures intensified as the US sought to prevent Indonesia from "going communist"[^6]

## The September 30 Movement

### Events of the Night

On the night of September 30-October 1, 1965, a group calling itself the "September 30 Movement" (Gerakan September Tiga Puluh / G30S) kidnapped and murdered six senior Army generals and one lieutenant. The group claimed to be acting to protect President Sukarno from a "Council of Generals" planning a coup.

The dead generals:

- Lieutenant General Ahmad Yani (Army Chief of Staff)
- Major General Suprapto
- Major General S. Parman
- Major General Haryono M.T.
- Brigadier General D.I. Pandjaitan
- Brigadier General Sutoyo Siswomiharjo
- First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean (adjutant to General Abdul Haris Nasution, who escaped)[^7]

### The Mystery

What actually happened remains disputed:

- **The official (Suharto-era) version:** The PKI planned and executed a coup attempt
- **Historical evidence:** Many scholars believe the movement was primarily an internal Army affair, with limited PKI involvement at a low level
- **The triggering role:** Whatever the truth, the Army leadership under Major General Suharto immediately seized control of the narrative, blaming the PKI entirely[^8]

### Suharto Takes Command

Within hours, Suharto—commander of the Army Strategic Reserve (KOSTRAD)—took control of the situation:

- Crushed the September 30 Movement militarily by October 1
- Took de facto command of the Army
- Launched a propaganda campaign portraying the PKI as depraved murderers (including false claims of sexual torture of the generals)
- Created the political conditions for mass murder[^9]

## The Killings

### Phases of Violence (October 1965 - March 1966)

**Phase 1: Army-Led Killings (October-November 1965)**
The Army moved first in Central Java and Bali, where the PKI was strongest:

- Army units killed known PKI leaders
- Local militias (often religious youth groups) were armed and encouraged to kill
- "Kill lists" were prepared from party membership records

**Phase 2: Mass Participation (November-December 1965)**
Violence spread to East Java, Sumatra, and other regions:

- Civilian death squads operated with Army coordination
- Muslim youth organizations (Ansor, Banser) and other groups participated
- Neighbors killed neighbors
- Entire villages were massacred

**Phase 3: Mopping Up (January-March 1966)**
The most intense killing subsided, but:

- Arrests and executions continued
- Hundreds of thousands were imprisoned without trial
- Mass deportations to prison camps[^10]

### Methods of Killing

The violence was characterized by its personal, communal nature:

- Victims were often killed by hand—with machetes, knives, swords, and clubs rather than guns
- Many were beheaded
- Bodies were thrown into rivers, wells, and caves, or buried in mass graves
- In Bali, entire families were killed together[^11]

### Regional Patterns

| Region        | Characteristics                                                                              |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Central Java  | First intensive killings; Army-led with NU (Muslim organization) participation               |
| East Java     | Massive communal violence; Ansor youth militias central                                      |
| Bali          | Extremely high per capita death toll; Hindu majority but Muslim-linked militias participated |
| North Sumatra | Attacks on ethnic Javanese and Chinese; plantation workers targeted                          |
| West Java     | Lower overall toll but significant violence in certain areas                                 |

## Death Toll

Estimates remain uncertain—the massacres happened secretly, and the Suharto regime suppressed documentation for decades:

**Conservative Estimates:**

- 500,000 killed

**Moderate Estimates:**

- 1 million killed (widely cited)

**Higher Estimates:**

- 2-3 million (some scholars and Indonesian investigators)

**Additional Victims:**

- 600,000-1,500,000 imprisoned without trial
- Many held for years or decades (known as "tapol"—political prisoners)
- Systematic torture, rape, and forced labor in detention
- "ET" (ex-tahanan politik) stigmatization affected millions of family members for generations[^12]

---

## International Involvement

### United States

The US government actively supported the killings:

**Known US Actions:**

- CIA maintained close contacts with Indonesian Army leaders
- US Embassy in Jakarta provided the Army with lists of 5,000 PKI members and suspected communists—effectively kill lists
- US officials communicated approval of the Army's actions
- The US provided communications equipment, small arms, and money to the Army
- Official US policy was to encourage the Army to "roll up" the PKI[^13]

**Declassified Documents:**
Beginning in 2017, released US documents confirmed the depth of American involvement and knowledge:

- The Embassy knew mass killings were occurring and approved
- Ambassador Marshall Green reported favorably on the "drastic action"
- The CIA tracked the killings in real time[^14]

### United Kingdom and Australia

- British and Australian intelligence participated in "black propaganda" campaigns against the PKI
- Declassified UK documents show officials discussed helping the Army eliminate the PKI
- Australia provided intelligence and communications support[^15]

## Historical Assessment

### Critical/Human Rights Perspective

**Crimes Against Humanity:** The 1965-66 killings meet the international legal definition of crimes against humanity—systematic attacks against a civilian population. Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM) concluded in 2012 that these events constituted gross human rights violations.[^16]

**State-Orchestrated Terror:** The Army planned, coordinated, and directly participated in the killings while mobilizing civilian death squads. This was not "communal violence" that spontaneously erupted; it was organized extermination.[^17]

**Cold War Crime:** The United States and its allies were deeply culpable, providing material support, intelligence, and political cover for mass murder in the name of anti-communism.[^18]

### Indonesian Government Position (Historical)

**New Order Narrative (1966-1998):** The killings were justified self-defense against a communist coup attempt. The PKI was portrayed as evil; annual propaganda films depicted communists as godless murderers. Discussion of the killings was taboo.

**Post-Suharto Position:** Since 1998, official positions have shifted, but no government has formally apologized or prosecuted perpetrators. The 2012 Komnas HAM report was rejected by the Attorney General.[^19]

---

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### The New Order (1966-1998)

The killings enabled Suharto's three-decade authoritarian rule:

- PKI and all communist organizations banned
- Political left eliminated from Indonesian life
- Military dominated politics and economy
- Anti-communist ideology institutionalized through education and censorship
- Political prisoners stigmatized for life; their descendants discriminated against[^20]

### Continuing Impunity

Despite reforms since 1998:

- No perpetrator has been prosecuted
- Mass graves remain unexcavated
- Survivors and families have received no official compensation or apology
- Organizations of perpetrators (such as Pemuda Pancasila) remain powerful
- The documentary "The Act of Killing" (2012) and "The Look of Silence" (2014) brought international attention[^21]

### Memory and Advocacy

- Human rights organizations (ICTJ, Amnesty, etc.) advocate for truth and justice
- Survivor groups have organized to document the killings
- International solidarity campaigns support accountability
- In 2016, an International People's Tribunal held in The Hague found Indonesia guilty of crimes against humanity (non-binding)[^22]
