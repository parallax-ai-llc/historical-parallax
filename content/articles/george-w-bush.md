## Summary

George Walker Bush (born July 6, 1946) served as the 43rd President of the United States (2001-2009). His presidency was defined by the September 11 terrorist attacks, the subsequent War on Terror, the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the use of torture, massive deficits, and the 2008 financial crisis. Once one of the least popular presidents, his reputation has improved slightly in the post-Trump era.
