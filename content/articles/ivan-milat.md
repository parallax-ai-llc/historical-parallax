## Summary
Ivan Milat was responsible for the 'Backpacker Murders' — the killing of seven young backpackers in Belanglo State Forest, Australia, between 1989 and 1992. Victims came from Australia, the UK, and Germany. Convicted in 1996, he was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences. He died of cancer in 2019.

## Early Life
Born December 27, 1944, in Sydney, one of 14 children of Croatian immigrants. He left school at 15 with a history of petty crime and robbery. He was an avid hunter who knew the Belanglo Forest intimately. He worked as a road worker. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1989 and 1992, Milat picked up hitchhiking backpackers and drove them to Belanglo State Forest. His seven victims were aged 19-22 from Australia, Britain, and Germany. They were stabbed, shot, and strangled. Some showed signs of prolonged restraint and torture. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Remains were discovered in September 1992 by orienteers. British backpacker Paul Onions, who survived a 1990 attack, came forward. His testimony and forensic evidence led to Milat's arrest on May 22, 1994. Convicted of seven murders in 1996, sentenced to life without parole. Died October 27, 2019. [^3]
