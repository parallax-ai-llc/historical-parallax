## Overview

The Oklahoma City bombing was the deadliest act of domestic terrorism in U.S. history. On April 19, 1995, Timothy McVeigh parked a rental truck filled with explosives in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City. The explosion at 9:02 AM sheared off the front of the building, checking floors into each other and killing 168 people, including 19 children in the building's daycare center. McVeigh, an anti-government extremist and Gulf War veteran, sought revenge for the federal government's siege at Waco exactly two years earlier. The attack shocked America, exposing the threat of domestic far-right militias.
