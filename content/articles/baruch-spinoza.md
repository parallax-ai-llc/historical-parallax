## Summary

Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese-Jewish origin who became one of the most radical and influential thinkers of the early modern period. Excommunicated from Amsterdam's Jewish community at age 23 for his heretical views, Spinoza developed a revolutionary philosophical system that identified God with Nature, rejected traditional religious authority, and championed freedom of thought. His rationalist philosophy, presented in his masterwork *Ethics*, profoundly influenced the Enlightenment and continues to shape modern thought. Despite living in relative obscurity as a lens grinder, Spinoza's ideas on democracy, biblical criticism, and metaphysics would inspire generations of philosophers, scientists, and political thinkers.

## Early Life and Background

Baruch (later Benedict) de Spinoza was born on November 24, 1632, in Amsterdam to a prominent merchant family within the city's Portuguese-Jewish community[^1][^2]. His family belonged to the Sephardic Jewish refugees who had fled the Iberian Peninsula following the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. Many of these families, including Spinoza's ancestors, had lived as *conversos*—Jews forced to convert to Catholicism who maintained Jewish practices in secret[^3]. After being arrested, tortured, and condemned by the Portuguese Inquisition, Spinoza's grandfather and father escaped to the religiously tolerant Dutch Republic, where they could openly practice Judaism[^4].

Spinoza's father, Michael de Spinoza, became a successful and wealthy merchant in Amsterdam, with business operations spanning considerable geographical reach[^5]. Michael eventually rose to prominence within the Portuguese-Jewish community, serving as an administrative officer of the united congregation Talmud Torah in 1649[^6]. Baruch's grandfather, Abraham Michael de Spinoza, had been one of the community's leaders, serving as president in 1639[^7]. This privileged background provided young Baruch with access to quality education and positioned him within Amsterdam's intellectual elite.

The family tragedy struck early when Spinoza's mother, Hanna Deborah, died in 1638, just before he turned six years old[^8]. Named after his maternal grandfather, Baruch received a traditional Jewish education at the community's Ets Haim yeshiva, where he learned Hebrew, studied the Torah, and encountered Jewish philosophy, including the works of Moses Maimonides[^9][^10]. The Ets Haim curriculum was unique in its emphasis on Torah study and maintained unprecedented resources for its students, expending huge sums on book acquisition[^11].

As Spinoza matured, he displayed exceptional intellectual abilities and began exploring ideas beyond traditional Jewish theology. He likely studied Latin with the freethinker Franciscus van den Enden, opening access to contemporary European philosophy, particularly the works of René Descartes[^12]. This exposure to secular philosophy and rationalist thought, combined with his own critical examination of religious texts, led him to develop views that increasingly diverged from orthodox Judaism. His questioning of fundamental religious doctrines—including the divine origin of the Torah, the immortality of the soul, and the existence of a providential God—brought him into direct conflict with the Amsterdam Jewish community's authorities[^13][^14].

## Rise to Prominence

Spinoza's path to philosophical prominence began paradoxically with his expulsion from the Jewish community. On July 27, 1656, at the age of twenty-three, Spinoza received the harshest *herem* (excommunication) ever pronounced by the Sephardic community of Amsterdam[^15][^16]. The writ condemned him with extraordinary vehemence for his "abominable heresies" and "monstrous deeds," though it never specified exactly what these offenses were[^17]. Historical evidence suggests his transgressive views included denying the divine origin of the Torah, rejecting the immortality of the soul, and challenging the concept of a providential God[^18].

The severity of Spinoza's excommunication reflected the Portuguese-Jewish community's precarious political position. Founded by refugees from the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions, many families were former *conversos* acutely aware of how they were perceived by their Dutch hosts[^19]. Community leaders took measures to publicly reassure Dutch authorities that they harbored no heretics or immortality-deniers, giving the *herem* a distinctly political dimension[^20]. The ban effectively severed Spinoza from his family, community, and inheritance, forcing him to forge an independent life.

Rather than retreating into obscurity, Spinoza embraced his independence. He abandoned his Hebrew name Baruch for its Latin equivalent, Benedictus, symbolizing his transition from the Jewish community to the broader European intellectual world[^21]. He learned the craft of lens grinding and polishing—a demanding occupation requiring discipline and patience that combined immediate financial needs with his interest in optics and scientific instrumentation[^22][^23]. Through this work, Spinoza supported himself modestly while gaining connections with prominent scientific figures including Christiaan Huygens, Johannes Hudde, and Henry Oldenburg, Secretary of the British Royal Society[^24].

During the late 1650s and early 1660s, Spinoza assembled a dedicated circle of followers and discussion partners, including Pieter Balling, Jarig Jelles, Lodewijk Meyer, Johannes Bouwmeester, and Adriaan Koerbagh[^25]. This intellectual community gathered to discuss his developing philosophical system and joined him in the pursuit of truth through reason. In 1663, Spinoza published his first work, *The Principles of Cartesian Philosophy*, presenting a critical exposition of Descartes's philosophy—the only book he would publish under his own name during his lifetime[^26][^27].

By 1670, Spinoza had completed and anonymously published his most controversial work, the *Tractatus Theologico-Politicus* (*Theological-Political Treatise*)[^28]. This groundbreaking text pioneered modern biblical criticism, argued for the separation of religion from state power, and defended freedom of thought and expression as essential to a free republic[^29]. The treatise caused immediate controversy and was widely condemned as atheistic and blasphemous, cementing Spinoza's reputation as a dangerous heretic[^30][^31]. Yet it also established him as a major intellectual force and a forerunner of the Radical Enlightenment[^32].

## Major Achievements

Spinoza's greatest achievement was his philosophical system, fully articulated in his masterwork *Ethics* (*Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata*), published posthumously in 1677[^33]. The *Ethics* represents perhaps the most ambitious attempt to apply Euclidean geometric method to philosophy, presenting a complete metaphysical, epistemological, and ethical system through definitions, axioms, propositions, and proofs[^34][^35]. This revolutionary work established Spinoza as one of the three great Continental rationalists of the seventeenth century, alongside Descartes and Leibniz[^36].

At the heart of Spinoza's metaphysics lies his radical monism: the doctrine that only one substance exists, which he identified as "God or Nature" (*Deus sive Natura*)[^37][^38]. This single infinite substance possesses infinite attributes, of which humans can comprehend two—thought and extension[^39]. Everything in the universe, including human beings, exists as modes (modifications) of this one substance[^40]. This framework rejected Cartesian mind-body dualism and traditional theological concepts of a transcendent, providential deity, instead presenting God as immanent in nature—the indwelling, not transcendent, cause of all things[^41][^42].

Spinoza's epistemology distinguished three kinds of knowledge: imagination (sensory experience and hearsay), reason (rational understanding of common notions), and intuitive knowledge (direct intellectual apprehension of particular things through God's essence)[^43]. He argued that true freedom comes through understanding, famously declaring that "the highest activity a human being can attain is learning for understanding, because to understand is to be free"[^44]. This rationalist approach made knowledge of God—understood as Nature's necessary laws—the path to human liberation from the tyranny of passions and superstition[^45].

In political philosophy, Spinoza advanced forceful and original arguments defending democratic governance, freedom of thought and expression, and the subordination of religious authority to secular power[^46]. His *Theological-Political Treatise* claimed that *libertas philosophandi*—a comprehensive freedom encompassing thought, speech, artistic expression, scientific investigation, and the ability to discuss controversial positions without fear—could be allowed in a free republic and indeed was essential to its peace and prosperity[^47][^48]. He argued that democracy, with all its flaws, best allows human nature to flourish and that no stable, free, successful society could be built if theological criteria formed the basis of its principles[^49][^50].

Spinoza's biblical criticism pioneered modern scholarly approaches to sacred texts. He analyzed Scripture using historical and philological methods, treating the Bible as a human document shaped by historical circumstances rather than as divine revelation[^51]. This approach influenced modern biblical scholarship and challenged religious authority's monopoly on scriptural interpretation. His *Tractatus Theologico-Politicus* became one of the most important philosophical works of the early modern period[^52].

Beyond his written works, Spinoza's life exemplified his philosophical principles. By seventeenth-century standards, he led an exemplary moral life, supporting himself through honest labor, cultivating friendships, and pursuing truth without regard for wealth or fame[^53]. His modest existence as a lens grinder demonstrated that philosophical wisdom required neither institutional position nor material abundance, only dedication to understanding reality through reason.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Spinoza's philosophy generated intense controversy from the moment his ideas became public. The 1656 excommunication marked only the beginning of sustained attacks from religious authorities across confessional boundaries. The *herem* document condemned his "abominable heresies" with unprecedented harshness, and the Jewish community never reversed this excommunication despite modern calls to do so[^54][^55]. As recently as 2015, hundreds attended a symposium in Amsterdam considering whether to lift the ban—the community ultimately declined[^56]. In 2021, a leading Spinoza scholar, Yitzhak Melamed, was briefly banned from Amsterdam's Portuguese synagogue and library before the decision was overturned, demonstrating the enduring sensitivity surrounding Spinoza's legacy[^57][^58].

Christian authorities proved equally hostile. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, being called a "Spinozist" was equivalent to being called an atheist[^59]. Critics perceived Spinoza as committed to reducing God to the material world, making him guilty of atheistic pantheism[^60]. His equation of God with Nature, denial of divine providence, rejection of miracles, and dismissal of personal immortality infuriated religious readers and made his name synonymous with heresy for over a century[^61][^62]. Catholic and Protestant theologians alike condemned his works as dangerously atheistic, despite Spinoza's own insistence that his philosophy was deeply religious[^63].

The *Theological-Political Treatise* generated extreme controversy even in the relatively tolerant Dutch Republic. Spinoza's views on Scripture—questioning Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, treating miracles as natural phenomena misunderstood by primitive peoples, and subjecting biblical texts to critical historical analysis—featured extensively in damning contemporary commentaries[^64][^65]. These radical biblical criticisms, combined with his arguments for separating religious and political authority, led to the treatise being widely banned and condemned as blasphemous[^66].

Philosophically, Spinoza's strict determinism troubled many readers. He denied free will, arguing that the natural laws of the universe dictate a cause-and-effect relationship beyond human control and that belief in free will was an illusion born of ignorance[^67][^68]. This necessitarianism seemed to eliminate moral responsibility and human agency, making Spinoza's ethics appear paradoxical—how could he prescribe how to live if humans lacked genuine choice? Critics found his system fatalistic and incompatible with meaningful human action.

Spinoza's writings were also rejected for their perceived obscurity and dangerous implications. His geometric method, while systematic, produced a dense, challenging text that few contemporaries fully understood. Those who did grasp his meaning often found it subversive to established social and political order. His philosophy threatened both religious authority (by denying transcendent deity and scriptural revelation) and political hierarchy (by championing democracy and freedom of thought). Authorities feared his ideas would undermine social stability[^69].

Even admirers acknowledged problems in Spinoza's system. Eighteenth and nineteenth-century German Idealists, while deeply influenced by Spinoza, aimed to overcome what they saw as the excessive determinism of his philosophy by securing a place for freedom of the subject within it[^70]. Leibniz, while sharing Spinoza's rationalism, developed his own metaphysical pluralism partly in reaction to Spinoza's monism, which Leibniz found philosophically problematic[^71].

The charge of atheism persisted despite scholarly debate about whether this characterization was accurate. While Spinoza was effectively read as an atheist by contemporaries and had such a radically different conception of God that he was certainly perceived as one, modern scholars debate whether "atheist" properly describes someone who devoted his entire philosophical system to understanding God's nature[^72][^73]. Similarly, characterizing him as a "pantheist" remains contested, as it's unclear this properly captures his conception of God[^74].

## Personal Life

Despite his philosophical radicalism, Spinoza lived a remarkably quiet, disciplined personal life. After his excommunication in 1656, he initially remained in Amsterdam, supporting himself through teaching while learning lens grinding and constructing optical instruments including microscopes and telescopes[^75]. The image of Spinoza as a hermit eating only gruel is an exaggeration; while he lived modestly, he was far from isolated and demonstrated considerable talent for friendship[^76][^77]. His only indulgences were smoking and wearing silver shoe buckles—modest pleasures by any seventeenth-century standard[^78].

Lens grinding became Spinoza's primary occupation, providing modest but sufficient income. As his biographer Steven Nadler noted, it was "a quiet, intense, and solitary occupation, demanding discipline and patience"[^79]. The work combined practical necessity with intellectual interest in optics and scientific instrumentation, allowing Spinoza to maintain connections with leading scientists while preserving his philosophical independence. He manufactured lenses for telescopes, microscopes, camera obscuras for artists, and spectacles[^80]. However, this occupation carried grave health risks: the silica glass dust likely contributed to his chronic lung ailment, probably tuberculosis complicated by silicosis[^81][^82].

Spinoza never married and left no record of romantic relationships. His social world centered on his philosophical circle rather than family life. From 1656 to 1661, his main discussion partners included Franciscus van den Enden, Pieter Balling, Jarig Jelles, Lodewijk Meyer, Johannes Bouwmeester, and Adriaan Koerbagh[^83]. Through his scientific work, he forged connections with prominent figures including Christiaan Huygens, Johannes Hudde, and Henry Oldenburg[^84]. This dedicated circle of followers gathered regularly to discuss his writings and pursue truth collectively through reason[^85].

Around 1661, Spinoza moved to Rijnsburg, a small village near Leiden, seeking greater solitude for philosophical work. In 1663, he relocated to Voorburg, closer to The Hague, and finally in 1670 moved to The Hague itself to have easier access to intellectual life and be closer to friends and followers[^86][^87]. In The Hague, he lived on a small stipend within the growing community of Dutch free-thinking intellectuals, renting rooms from various landlords while working on his philosophical writings[^88].

Spinoza's health began failing in 1676. He had been suffering from tuberculosis for more than twenty years according to his early biographer Colerus[^89]. The lung disease, likely exacerbated by decades of inhaling glass dust, progressively weakened him. Despite his deteriorating condition, Spinoza continued his philosophical work until the end. On February 21, 1677, he died suddenly in The Hague at age 44, attended by his physician friend Georg Herman Schuller[^90][^91]. He left no will, having few possessions beyond his manuscripts and some optical equipment. Four days after his death, Spinoza was buried in the Nieuwe Kerk in The Hague, sharing a vault with six others[^92].

His contemporaries remembered him as a man of exceptional character. Despite rejecting traditional religious authority, Spinoza lived according to rigorous ethical principles derived from reason. He declined a pension offer from King Louis XIV of France and refused a philosophy professorship at the University of Heidelberg, choosing to maintain his independence rather than compromise his freedom to philosophize[^93]. This integrity, combined with his modest lifestyle and dedication to truth, earned him the respect even of those who vehemently disagreed with his philosophy.

## Legacy

Spinoza's influence on Western thought proved far more profound than his obscure life might suggest. While largely rejected during his lifetime, his ideas became foundational to the Enlightenment and continue shaping modern philosophy, science, politics, and culture. Recent scholarship now recognizes Spinoza as perhaps the major contributor to Enlightenment thinking and politics—a significant revision from earlier assessments[^94]. Jonathan Israel identifies Spinoza as "the first major figure of the Radical Enlightenment," arguing that it was Spinoza who most clearly rejected all supernatural admixtures with reason and with whom philosophical modernity truly begins[^95][^96].

Spinoza's philosophical legacy centers on his revolutionary reconception of God, nature, and freedom. His pantheistic identification of God with Nature provided an alternative to both traditional theism and atheistic materialism that proved enormously attractive to later thinkers[^97]. Three core ideas particularly resonated: the unity of all existence, the regularity of all natural phenomena, and the identity of spirit and nature[^98]. This framework enabled modern scientific thinking by removing supernatural intervention from natural explanation while maintaining a spiritual dimension to reality.

The impact on subsequent philosophers was immense. Leading German figures including Lessing, Goethe, Kant, Hegel, Fichte, Schelling, Heine, and Nietzsche remained preoccupied with Spinoza throughout their creative lives[^99]. Hegel famously declared: "The fact is that Spinoza is made a testing-point in modern philosophy, so that it may really be said: You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all"[^100]. The relationship between Hegel and Spinoza proved particularly significant, as both inaugurated traditions of thought that have remained in continuous dialogue and conflict since Hegel first criticized Spinoza's determinism while incorporating monistic elements into his own system[^101][^102].

Twentieth-century French philosophy experienced a major Spinoza revival. Influential thinkers including Louis Althusser, Gilles Deleuze, Antonio Negri, Étienne Balibar, and Marilena Chaui drew upon Spinoza's philosophy[^103]. Deleuze, in his 1968 doctoral thesis, named Spinoza "the prince of philosophers"[^104]. French scholars produced monumental Spinoza scholarship, including Pierre Macherey's five-volume commentary on the *Ethics*, described as "a monument of Spinoza commentary"[^105]. This French Spinozism used his rationalism as a bulwark against phenomenology's allegedly irrationalist tendencies and proved foundational for Althusser's Marxism and Deleuze's metaphysics[^106].

Albert Einstein's embrace of Spinoza brought the philosopher to wider public consciousness. Einstein named Spinoza as the philosopher who most influenced his worldview, stating his belief in "Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings"[^107][^108]. This endorsement from the twentieth century's most famous scientist validated Spinoza's naturalistic conception of divinity and demonstrated the compatibility between his philosophy and modern physics.

Spinoza's political philosophy profoundly influenced modern liberal democracy. His arguments for freedom of thought and expression, separation of religion from state power, and democratic governance contributed to developing principles of human rights and religious tolerance[^109]. He was arguably "the first philosopher to insist that you can't build a free, stable, and successful society, or a moral order that is stable, if theological criteria are allowed to be the basis of its principles"[^110]. His *Theological-Political Treatise* pioneered arguments for comprehensive freedom—*libertas philosophandi*—that anticipated modern concepts of civil liberties[^111].

His biblical criticism established methods that became standard in modern scriptural scholarship. By treating the Bible as a historical document subject to critical analysis rather than divine revelation requiring faith-based interpretation, Spinoza founded modern biblical studies and challenged religious authority's interpretive monopoly[^112]. This critical approach significantly influenced modern theological and historical scholarship.

Contemporary Spinoza scholarship remains vibrant, with new interpretative approaches continually emerging. Modern scholars have moved away from mechanical physical causality toward examining conceptual and semantic connections in his system[^113]. Edwin Curley's influential translations made Spinoza's thought more accessible to contemporary anglophone philosophy[^114]. The ongoing scholarly debates about interpreting his conception of substance, attributes, and modes demonstrate the continued philosophical fertility of his system[^115].

Spinoza's rehabilitation in his native Netherlands culminated symbolically when his portrait appeared on the Dutch 1000-guilder banknote, legal tender until the euro's introduction in 2002[^116]. This honor from the nation that once condemned him as a heretic signifies how profoundly reassessments of his contribution to Western thought have evolved.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship overwhelmingly recognizes Spinoza as one of the most important and radical philosophers of the early modern period and among the most relevant seventeenth-century philosophers today[^117]. His philosophy holds a position of crucial importance and influence in early modern thought, with his comprehensive speculative system ranking among the period's most ambitious intellectual achievements[^118][^119]. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes that "his philosophy is increasingly recognized as holding a position of crucial importance and influence in early modern thought"[^120].

Admirers praise Spinoza's rigorous rationalism and systematic approach to fundamental philosophical questions. His application of geometric method to philosophy, while challenging, demonstrated unprecedented intellectual ambition in attempting to derive ethics and metaphysics from clearly defined first principles[^121]. The *Ethics* stands as a monument of philosophical systematization, addressing questions of God, nature, human psychology, knowledge, freedom, and virtue within a unified conceptual framework.

Spinoza's championing of freedom receives particularly strong endorsement from modern commentators. His arguments that "no man's mind can possibly lie wholly at the disposition of another, for no one can willingly transfer his natural right of free reason and judgment, or be compelled so to do" anticipated modern conceptions of inalienable rights[^122]. His defense of *libertas philosophandi* as essential to peace and prosperity in a free republic proved remarkably prescient given subsequent democratic developments[^123][^124].

Political philosophers appreciate Spinoza's contributions to democratic theory and religious tolerance. His insistence that theological criteria cannot form the basis of a stable, free society established principles central to secular liberal democracy[^125]. His arguments that freedom of inquiry is not merely consistent with state security and prosperity but actually essential to them remain influential in contemporary political philosophy[^126].

Einstein's endorsement powerfully validated Spinoza's naturalistic conception of divinity. Einstein's identification with "Spinoza's God" demonstrated how his philosophy could reconcile scientific understanding with spiritual sensibility—offering an alternative to both supernatural theism and reductive materialism[^127]. This compatibility with modern science contrasts sharply with traditional religious frameworks that Einstein and other scientists found incompatible with physics.

Literary and cultural figures have celebrated Spinoza's intellectual courage and personal integrity. His willingness to accept excommunication and poverty rather than compromise his philosophical convictions exemplifies dedication to truth. George Eliot admired him sufficiently to translate his works, while writers from Goethe to Jorge Luis Borges found inspiration in his ideas[^128]. The novelist and poet Novalis called him a "God-intoxicated man," capturing how Spinoza's apparent atheism paradoxically expressed profound religious feeling.

Contemporary scholars praise Spinoza's relevance to current philosophical debates. His monism offers alternatives to persistent mind-body problems in philosophy of mind. His deterministic yet ethical system provides resources for thinking about moral responsibility without libertarian free will. His political philosophy speaks to ongoing questions about democracy, pluralism, and the proper relationship between religion and state power. These continued applications demonstrate the living quality of his thought.

### Negative Views

Despite his elevated status in contemporary philosophy, Spinoza has never lacked critics. Religious thinkers from his time to the present have condemned his philosophy as fundamentally atheistic and destructive of genuine piety. The charge that he reduced God to Nature, eliminating transcendence, providence, and personal relationship with the divine, remains a central criticism from theological perspectives[^129][^130]. For orthodox believers across religious traditions, Spinoza's God—impersonal, necessitated by its own nature, identical with the natural world—bears no meaningful resemblance to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob or to any object of worship[^131].

The Amsterdam Jewish community's refusal to lift his excommunication reflects enduring religious opposition. When scholars proposed rescinding the *herem* in 2015, the chief rabbi cited Spinoza's "preposterous ideas, where he was tearing apart the very fundamentals of our religion" as justification for maintaining it[^132]. This position represents continued rejection of Spinoza's challenge to revealed religion, scriptural authority, and traditional theology.

Philosophical critics have questioned the coherence and implications of Spinoza's system. His strict determinism, denying free will and making all events follow necessarily from God's nature, seems to eliminate moral responsibility and make ethics paradoxical[^133]. If humans cannot genuinely choose their actions, on what basis can Spinoza prescribe how to live? Critics argue his ethical teachings contradict his metaphysical determinism, creating internal inconsistency.

Leibniz, while sharing Spinoza's rationalism, developed his own pluralistic metaphysics partly to avoid what he saw as problems in Spinoza's monism[^134]. Leibniz found the reduction of all individual things to mere modes of a single substance philosophically problematic, sacrificing the genuine reality of individual beings. This criticism that Spinoza's monism eliminates real particularity in favor of an abstract universal has recurred throughout subsequent philosophy.

German Idealists, though deeply influenced by Spinoza, explicitly aimed to overcome what they perceived as his system's excessive determinism[^135]. They sought to secure a place for subjective freedom within a systematic philosophy—something they felt Spinoza's necessitarianism failed to provide. Hegel criticized Spinoza's substance as too static and undifferentiated, lacking the dynamic development Hegel saw as essential to reality.

Critics of Spinoza's political philosophy note tensions between his theoretical egalitarianism and his actual political views. While defending democracy and freedom generally, Spinoza excluded women from political participation and showed ambivalence about extending full freedoms to the uneducated masses[^136]. Some commentators find his political thought less consistently radical than often claimed.

The geometric method itself has attracted criticism. While systematic and rigorous, the approach can seem artificially imposed on subject matter not naturally suited to mathematical demonstration. Ethical and metaphysical conclusions depend on initial definitions and axioms whose truth is not self-evident despite Spinoza's claims. Critics argue the geometric presentation obscures rather than clarifies, creating an illusion of demonstrative certainty for conclusions that remain fundamentally contestable.

Contemporary critics sometimes characterize Spinoza as excessively rationalistic, undervaluing emotion, particularity, and embodied existence in favor of abstract intellectual comprehension. Feminist and phenomenological critics have questioned whether his emphasis on reason and necessity adequately addresses human experience's concrete, lived dimensions. The charge that Spinoza's philosophy is too abstract and removed from actual human life represents a persistent line of criticism.
