## Summary

Harold Pinter was a British playwright who received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2005. His plays including The Birthday Party, The Homecoming, and Betrayal revolutionized theater with their menacing pauses, ambiguous dialogue, and the concept of the 'Pinteresque.' His later work became increasingly political, addressing war and human rights abuses.
