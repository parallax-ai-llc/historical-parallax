## Summary

Constantine XI Dragases Palaiologos (February 8, 1404 – May 29, 1453) was the last reigning Byzantine Emperor, ruling from January 23, 1449, until his death during the fall of Constantinople.[^1][^2] The fourth son of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and Helena Dragaš, Constantine spent his early career as Despot of the Morea, where he demonstrated considerable military skill by reconquering much of the Peloponnese.[^3] His reign as emperor was dominated by the existential threat posed by the Ottoman Empire under Sultan Mehmed II, culminating in the fifty-three-day siege of Constantinople in 1453.[^4] Constantine died fighting during the final Ottoman assault on May 29, 1453, his body never definitively identified, marking the end of over 1,100 years of continuous Roman imperial history.[^5][^6]

## Early Life and Background

Constantine Dragases Palaiologos was born on February 8, 1404, in Constantinople as the eighth of ten children of Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos and his Serbian wife Helena Dragaš, daughter of the Serbian ruler Konstantin Dejanović.[^7][^8] As the fourth surviving son among Manuel II's male heirs—which included the future emperor John VIII, Theodore (despot of the Morea), and younger brothers Demetrios and Thomas—Constantine's prospects for inheriting the imperial throne initially appeared remote.[^9] The younger sons Constantine, Demetrios, and Thomas were kept in Constantinople during their childhood, as there was insufficient land remaining in the shrinking Byzantine Empire to grant them territories to govern, unlike their older brothers who received provincial appointments.[^10]

Little is documented about Constantine's early education, though the imperial household emphasized classical learning and military preparedness, reflecting the era's necessities for rulers facing the existential threat of Ottoman expansion.[^11] From an early age, Constantine was admired by George Sphrantzes, who would later become a famed Byzantine historian and enter Constantine's service as a close confidant.[^12] Later encomiasts often wrote that Constantine had always been courageous, adventurous, and skilled in martial arts, horsemanship, and hunting, suggesting an upbringing focused on the warrior virtues necessary for a prince in a beleaguered empire.[^13]

Constantine's formative years coincided with a period of desperate diplomacy and intermittent warfare as the Byzantine Empire struggled to survive between the expanding Ottoman sultanate and the frequently indifferent or hostile Christian powers of Western Europe. His father Manuel II had managed to preserve Constantinople through skillful diplomacy, tributary arrangements with the Ottomans, and appeals to the West, strategies that would profoundly influence Constantine's own approach to statecraft.[^14] The young prince would have witnessed firsthand the humiliation of Ottoman suzerainty, the theological controversies surrounding potential union with the Catholic Church, and the steady erosion of Byzantine territory—experiences that shaped his understanding of the empire's precarious position.

## Rise to Power

Constantine's path to prominence began in the 1420s when he demonstrated exceptional talent as a military commander in defense of Byzantine territories. In 1427–1428, he and his brother John successfully fended off an attack on the Morea (the Peloponnese) by Carlo I Tocco, the ruler of Epirus, showcasing his capabilities in defensive warfare.[^15] Following this success, Constantine was proclaimed Despot of the Morea in 1428 and ruled the province together with his older brother Theodore and younger brother Thomas.[^16] This appointment marked a crucial turning point in his career, providing him with territory to govern and the opportunity to prove his administrative and military abilities.

During his tenure as Despot of the Morea from 1428 to 1449, Constantine and his brothers achieved the remarkable feat of extending Byzantine rule to cover almost the entire Peloponnese for the first time since the Fourth Crusade more than two hundred years before.[^17] By the early 1430s, their combined efforts had ensured that nearly all of the Peloponnese was under Byzantine control again, representing one of the empire's few territorial expansions during this period of general decline.[^18] Constantine accomplished this through a combination of military campaigns, diplomatic marriages, and strategic alliances with local powers, demonstrating political acumen that would later recommend him for the imperial throne.

One of Constantine's most ambitious projects was the reconstruction of the Hexamilion wall, an ancient defensive barrier stretching across the Isthmus of Corinth that protected the Peloponnese from northern invaders.[^19] After the Turks had destroyed it in 1431, Constantine and Thomas completely restored the wall by March 1444, a massive engineering project that impressed many of their subjects and contemporaries, including the Venetian lords in the Peloponnese who had politely declined to help with its funding.[^20] This achievement demonstrated Constantine's ability to mobilize resources and labor for major defensive works, a skill that would prove crucial during the siege of Constantinople.

In the summer of 1444, emboldened by his successes and perhaps overconfident in Byzantine military capabilities, Constantine launched an invasion of the Latin Duchy of Athens from the Morea, swiftly conquering Thebes and Athens and forcing the Florentine duke to pay him tribute.[^21] This represented the last offensive campaign of the Byzantine Empire and briefly seemed to herald a reversal of Byzantine fortunes in mainland Greece. However, these successes provoked devastating Ottoman retaliation that would expose the fundamental weakness of Byzantine military power.

Sultan Murad II responded to Constantine's territorial gains with overwhelming force. In December 1446, a great Ottoman army under Murad marched against the Hexamilion wall, bringing cannons that reduced the supposedly impregnable fortification to rubble within days.[^22] Although the wall might have held against a conventional assault, Constantine had not anticipated the destructive power of Ottoman artillery. Most of the defenders were killed or captured, and Constantine and Thomas barely escaped the catastrophic defeat.[^23] The brothers were forced to accept Murad as their overlord, pay tribute, and promise never to restore the Hexamilion wall, a humiliating reversal that foreshadowed the fate that would befall Constantinople itself.

Despite this setback, Constantine's reputation remained strong enough that when Emperor John VIII Palaiologos died childless on October 31, 1448, Constantine was recognized as the legitimate successor.[^24] He was trusted and favored to such an extent by John VIII that he had been designated as regent twice during the emperor's journeys away from Constantinople in 1423–1424 and 1437–1440.[^25] Constantine was crowned Emperor on January 6, 1449, in the city of Mystras in the Morea rather than in Constantinople itself, as Ottoman control of the intervening territory made travel to the capital dangerous.[^26] This unconventional coronation, conducted far from the traditional setting of Hagia Sophia, symbolized the reduced circumstances of the Byzantine Empire that Constantine had inherited.

## Major Achievements

Constantine's most tangible achievements came from his governance of the Morea before ascending to the imperial throne. The near-complete recovery of the Peloponnese under Byzantine rule represented a rare territorial expansion during an era of general imperial contraction.[^27] Constantine and his brother Thomas accomplished this through skillful military campaigns that exploited divisions among the Latin principalities remaining in Greece, combined with diplomatic initiatives including strategic marriages to local ruling families.[^28] The reconquest of territory that had been lost since the Fourth Crusade's devastation of the Byzantine Empire two centuries earlier gave hope to Byzantine patriots that imperial revival might still be possible.

The reconstruction of the Hexamilion wall stood as Constantine's greatest engineering accomplishment and demonstrated his capacity for large-scale organization and mobilization of resources.[^29] The wall, stretching approximately six kilometers across the Isthmus of Corinth, required massive amounts of labor, materials, and coordination to rebuild. Constantine completed this project in a matter of months, restoring a defensive barrier that had protected the Peloponnese since ancient times. Although the wall would ultimately fail against Ottoman artillery in 1446, the speed and efficiency of its reconstruction showcased Constantine's administrative abilities and his commitment to defending Byzantine territories through both military and engineering means.

Constantine's military campaigns in central Greece in 1444 represented the Byzantine Empire's last offensive operations and temporarily expanded Byzantine influence beyond the Peloponnese.[^30] The swift conquest of Thebes and Athens demonstrated that Byzantine forces, when properly led and motivated, could still achieve military victories against the Latin states of Greece. Although these gains proved impossible to hold in the face of Ottoman retaliation, they briefly rekindled dreams of Byzantine imperial restoration and showed that Constantine possessed the strategic vision and tactical ability to conduct successful offensive campaigns.

As emperor, Constantine worked tirelessly to prepare Constantinople for the inevitable Ottoman siege. Throughout the long winter of 1452–1453, he ordered the citizens of Constantinople to restore the city's imposing Theodosian walls, which had protected the city for over a thousand years, and to gather as many weapons as they could from whatever sources were available.[^31] Ships were sent to islands still under Byzantine rule to gather further supplies of food, weapons, and manpower.[^32] These preparations, though ultimately insufficient against the overwhelming Ottoman forces, demonstrated Constantine's clear understanding of the military realities facing the city and his determination to mount the strongest possible defense.

Constantine's leadership during the siege of Constantinople itself represented perhaps his finest hour. Despite being vastly outnumbered—commanding only about 7,000 defenders against an Ottoman army perhaps numbering as many as 80,000 men—Constantine maintained discipline and morale throughout the fifty-three-day siege.[^33][^34] He took personal charge of the defense, working closely with the Genoese military expert Giovanni Giustiniani Longo, and made daily inspections of the walls, encouraging his troops and personally participating in the defense.[^35] Contemporary sources from both Byzantine and Ottoman chroniclers praised his courage and leadership during the siege, noting that he fought alongside his soldiers rather than directing the defense from safety.

Constantine's efforts to secure Western military aid, though largely unsuccessful, demonstrated his realistic understanding that the Byzantine Empire could not survive alone against Ottoman power. He supported the controversial Union of Florence, which sought to reconcile the Orthodox and Catholic churches, primarily as a means of securing military assistance from Catholic Europe.[^36] Although this stance proved deeply unpopular with much of his Orthodox clergy and populace, it reflected Constantine's pragmatic willingness to make difficult decisions in pursuit of the empire's survival. The limited Western military aid that did arrive—most notably the contingent led by Giovanni Giustiniani—proved its value during the siege, justifying Constantine's controversial religious policies despite their political costs.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Constantine's most significant controversy centered on his support for the Union of Florence, the 1439 church council that attempted to reunite the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches under papal authority.[^37] When Constantine formally proclaimed the Union in Hagia Sophia in December 1452, hoping this would secure military aid from Western Europe, the declaration was overwhelmingly rejected by his subjects and dangerously estranged him from key figures including his chief minister and military commander, the Megas Doux Loukas Notaras.[^38] Most Greek priests, monks, and common people opposed union with what they considered Western "heretics" and "schismatics," famously declaring "Better the turban than the tiara!"[^39] This religious division fatally weakened Byzantine unity at the moment when solidarity was most desperately needed.

The Orthodox Church has never canonized Constantine XI as a saint, partly due to controversy surrounding his personal religious beliefs and his willingness to compromise Orthodox doctrine for political advantage.[^40] Some traditional Orthodox Christians have argued that Constantine's "heretical beliefs" and his compromising of the Faith in order to gain material aid from Latin lands disqualified him from sainthood, despite his heroic death defending a Christian city.[^41] During the centuries of Ottoman rule, any effort by the Orthodox Church to officially glorify Constantine as a saint would have been seen as an act of rebellion, and after Greek independence in the 19th century, formal canonization was deemed unnecessary given his widespread veneration as an ethnomartyr.[^42]

Constantine's younger brother Demetrios Palaiologos contested his claim to the imperial throne in 1448–1449, leveraging widespread opposition to the Union of Florence which Constantine supported.[^43] Demetrios framed Constantine's pro-union stance as a betrayal of Byzantine Orthodox traditions and rallied anti-union sentiment against his brother's succession. Although Constantine ultimately prevailed and took the throne, this fraternal dispute weakened imperial authority at a critical moment and reflected genuine popular opposition to Constantine's religious policies.

Modern historians have offered mixed assessments of Constantine's diplomatic abilities. While nineteenth-century writers tended to portray him as a tragic hero of a doomed polity, twentieth-century scholarship has been more critical, acknowledging his bravery and cultural patronage while pointing out diplomatic errors and his failure to mobilize broader support for the empire's defense.[^44] Some scholars have argued that Constantine was "neither a great statesman nor soldier" and was "ineffective diplomatically," unable to inspire his people to support him in achieving his visionary plans.[^45] His efforts to pressure Sultan Mehmed II by threatening to release an Ottoman prince held in Constantinople backfired, proving risky and, in Ottoman eyes, provocative rather than deterrent.[^46]

The catastrophic failure of the Hexamilion wall in 1446 exposed serious flaws in Constantine's strategic judgment. Although the wall's reconstruction had been an impressive engineering feat, Constantine apparently failed to appreciate the destructive capability of Ottoman siege artillery, leading him to invest enormous resources in a fortification that crumbled within days when tested by cannon fire.[^47] This failure should have served as a warning about the vulnerability of Constantinople's own walls to artillery bombardment, yet Constantine's preparations for the 1453 siege suggest he did not fully internalize this lesson about the changing nature of siege warfare.

Constantine's inability to secure an heir represented a critical failure that contributed to Byzantine political instability. Despite attempts by his friend George Sphrantzes to find him a third wife after his first two wives died in childbirth, Constantine ultimately died unmarried and childless.[^48] His failure to produce an heir meant that succession questions remained unresolved until the empire's final moments, contributing to political divisions within Constantinople during the critical period before the Ottoman siege. Some historians have suggested that Constantine's focus on military affairs and his extended absences from Constantinople during his search for a bride reflected misplaced priorities given the empire's desperate circumstances.

## Personal Life

Constantine married twice, though both marriages ended tragically and produced no surviving heirs. His first wife was Theodora Tocco (originally named Creusa), niece of Carlo I Tocco of Epirus, whom he married on July 1, 1428, shortly after being proclaimed Despot of the Morea.[^49] The marriage served diplomatic purposes, helping to secure peace with Epirus following the recent conflict, but also appears to have been personally agreeable to Constantine. Theodora died in November 1429, likely from complications of childbirth along with her infant, leaving Constantine widowed after barely more than a year of marriage.[^50]

Constantine married his second wife, Caterina Gattilusio, in August 1441.[^51] Caterina was the daughter of Dorino I Gattilusio, the Genoese lord of the island of Lesbos, and the marriage represented another diplomatic alliance, this time with the important Genoese trading family that controlled strategic Aegean islands. After the wedding, Constantine left Caterina with her father on Lesbos while he traveled to the Morea to attend to military and administrative duties, a separation that proved permanent when Caterina died in 1442, also apparently from complications of pregnancy.[^52] The tragic loss of both wives in childbirth, along with their infants, deeply affected Constantine and left him without heirs at a time when securing the imperial succession was crucial.

After Caterina's death and his accession to the imperial throne, Constantine made several attempts to remarry and produce an heir. In 1447, he dispatched his trusted friend George Sphrantzes on a diplomatic mission to Trebizond and Georgia to find a suitable bride, with the choice eventually falling on a Georgian princess, daughter of George VIII of Georgia.[^53] However, these negotiations were overtaken by the tragic events of 1453 and never concluded. Constantine also attempted to marry Mara Branković, daughter of the Serbian Despot Đurađ Branković and widow of Sultan Murad II, whose position gave her influence at the Ottoman court that might have proven valuable.[^54] This courtship failed because Mara had taken a vow of celibacy following her husband's death, refusing to remarry despite the political advantages such a union might have offered both parties.

Some sources suggest that Constantine may have had one daughter named Magdalena, though the historical evidence for this is uncertain and disputed by most scholars.[^55] If Magdalena existed, she would have been born from one of Constantine's two marriages, but no reliable contemporary sources mention her, and she plays no role in succession disputes or later Byzantine history. The question of whether Constantine had any surviving children remains unresolved, though the scholarly consensus is that he died childless.

Contemporary sources generally speak respectfully of Emperor Constantine's personal character. George Sphrantzes, who knew Constantine intimately and served him faithfully for decades, portrayed him as courageous, devout, and deeply committed to his duties as ruler.[^56] Other Byzantine chroniclers described Constantine as personally brave, skilled in military arts, and devoted to the defense of his people and his faith. These characterizations, while potentially biased by the authors' loyalty to the emperor and by the tragic circumstances of his death, appear consistent across multiple sources and suggest that Constantine genuinely possessed the martial virtues and sense of duty expected of a Byzantine emperor.

Constantine is often remembered as a heroic figure who stood defiantly against overwhelming odds, and in modern Greece and among Orthodox Christians worldwide, he is seen as a symbol of resistance and sacrifice.[^57] His decision to remain in Constantinople and die fighting rather than flee to safety has become central to his legendary status. The image of the last Roman emperor choosing death in battle over survival in exile has resonated across centuries, transforming Constantine from a historical figure into an icon of courage and devotion to duty.

## Legacy

Constantine XI's death on May 29, 1453, marked the definitive end of the Eastern Roman Empire, which traced its origins to Constantine the Great's foundation of Constantinople as the Roman Empire's new capital in 330 CE, representing an unbroken imperial continuity of over 1,100 years.[^58] For historians, Constantine's fall symbolizes the end of the medieval period and the transition to the early modern era in the eastern Mediterranean. The conquest of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turks shifted the balance of power decisively, establishing Ottoman dominance over the region for the next four centuries and fundamentally altering the political, religious, and cultural landscape of southeastern Europe and the Near East.

In Greek Orthodox culture and later Greek national narratives, Constantine was transformed into a martyr-emperor whose final stand offered spiritual consolation for political disaster.[^59] Although the Orthodox Church has never officially canonized him, Orthodox Christians widely venerate Constantine XI as a saint and national martyr, particularly in Greece and other formerly Byzantine territories.[^60] His feast day is observed on May 29, the anniversary of his death and the fall of Constantinople, a date that holds profound significance in Greek Orthodox memory as a day of mourning for the lost empire and capital.

The legend of the "Marble Emperor" (Marmaromenos Vasilias in Greek) emerged in the late 15th century and became deeply embedded in Greek folklore.[^61] According to this popular belief, Constantine did not actually die during the fall of Constantinople but was rescued by an angel at the last moment, turned into marble, and hidden in a cave beneath the earth near the Golden Gate of Constantinople.[^62] There he sleeps, awaiting a call from heaven to awaken, reclaim his city, and restore the Christian empire.[^63] This legend provided hope and spiritual resistance during the long centuries of Ottoman rule, suggesting that the Byzantine defeat was not permanent and that divine intervention would eventually restore the rightful Christian order.

For Greek nationalism in the 19th and 20th centuries, Constantine XI became a powerful symbol of resistance against foreign domination and of the continuity between ancient Greek civilization, the Byzantine Empire, and the modern Greek nation. The Megali Idea (Great Idea), which envisioned the restoration of Greek control over Constantinople and other formerly Byzantine territories, drew heavily on the memory and legend of Constantine XI.[^64] Even after the catastrophic failure of Greek military campaigns in Asia Minor in the 1920s ended practical hopes of reconquering Constantinople, Constantine remained an important figure in Greek national consciousness, representing both the tragedy of foreign conquest and the enduring spirit of Greek civilization.

Constantine's reputation in historical memory has served as a hinge between two eras: the medieval Byzantine world and the rising Ottoman Empire.[^65] Western European historians long portrayed the fall of Constantinople as a catastrophic rupture that ended the last remnant of the Roman Empire and threatened Christian Europe with Islamic expansion. Modern historians have offered more nuanced assessments, recognizing that the Byzantine Empire had long been in terminal decline and that its fall, while historically significant, was perhaps inevitable given the correlation of forces in the mid-15th century eastern Mediterranean.

In contemporary historical scholarship, Constantine stands as a figure whose personal valor and limited administrative skill were overwhelmed by structural forces that reshaped the eastern Mediterranean.[^66] Recent studies emphasize the impossible situation Constantine faced: governing an impoverished state surrounded by hostile neighbors, with a Europe preoccupied with its own wars and generally indifferent to Byzantine survival. Within these constraints, Constantine performed as well as could be reasonably expected, showing courage, devotion to duty, and tactical competence, even though these virtues proved insufficient against the overwhelming power of the Ottoman Empire under Mehmed II.

The historical debate about Constantine's religious legacy continues to generate discussion. His support for the Union of Florence, undertaken from political necessity rather than theological conviction, alienated many of his subjects but may have represented the only realistic hope for securing Western military aid.[^67] The limited assistance that did arrive from the West—particularly the forces led by Giovanni Giustiniani—proved valuable during the siege, suggesting that Constantine's controversial religious policy had some practical merit despite its political costs and the theological objections it raised among Orthodox believers.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarly appreciation of Constantine XI emphasizes his courage, determination, and commitment to duty under almost impossibly difficult circumstances. Donald M. Nicol's influential 1992 biography "The Immortal Emperor" portrayed Constantine sympathetically as a tragic hero overwhelmed by forces beyond his control, while acknowledging that the emperor displayed genuine virtues of leadership and personal bravery.[^68] Nicol and other historians have noted that Constantine's accomplishments in the Morea before becoming emperor—particularly the near-complete reconquest of the Peloponnese—demonstrated real military and administrative ability that deserves recognition beyond his famous last stand at Constantinople.

Contemporary Greek and Byzantine sources unanimously praise Constantine's conduct during the siege of Constantinople. George Sphrantzes, who served Constantine faithfully and witnessed the siege firsthand, described the emperor as brave, devout, and utterly committed to defending his city and people.[^69] Other Byzantine chroniclers echoed these assessments, portraying Constantine as a model of imperial virtue who chose death in battle over survival through flight or surrender. Even Ottoman sources generally acknowledged Constantine's courage during the final battle, a remarkable testimony given that such respect for defeated enemies was not universal in 15th-century warfare chronicles.

Historians have particularly praised Constantine's realistic understanding of Byzantine weakness and his pragmatic willingness to make difficult decisions in pursuit of survival. His support for church union with Rome, while unpopular with his subjects, reflected a clear-eyed assessment that the Byzantine Empire could not survive without Western military aid.[^70] That this strategy ultimately failed to produce sufficient assistance does not negate the strategic logic behind it, and Constantine deserves credit for attempting every possible avenue to secure help for his beleaguered empire, even at the cost of his own popularity.

Constantine's leadership during the siege itself has earned widespread historical admiration. Vastly outnumbered and with inadequate resources, he maintained discipline and morale among his diverse defending force, which included Byzantine troops, Genoese and Venetian mercenaries, and various other contingents.[^71] He took personal charge of critical defensive positions, fought alongside his men, and refused opportunities to escape, instead choosing to die defending his capital. These actions established a model of leadership through personal example that has resonated across subsequent centuries and contributed to his legendary status.

Marios Philippides, whose 2018 biography "Constantine XI Dragaš Palaeologus (1404–1453): The Last Emperor of Byzantium" represents the most thorough modern scholarly study of the emperor, argues that Constantine's achievements in the Morea and his competent administration deserve more attention than they typically receive.[^72] Philippides contends that traditional narratives, including Nicol's, have been "hopelessly unbalanced," devoting extensive coverage to Constantine's brief four-year reign as emperor while neglecting his longer and more successful eleven-year period as ruler of the Morea.[^73] According to Philippides, a comprehensive assessment of Constantine must acknowledge both his genuine accomplishments in the Peloponnese and his ultimately tragic tenure as emperor.

### Negative Views

Critical scholarly assessments of Constantine emphasize his diplomatic failures and his inability to unite his subjects behind a coherent strategy for imperial survival. His support for the Union of Florence, while motivated by the practical need for Western military aid, fatally divided Byzantine society at the moment when unity was most essential.[^74] The bitter religious controversy that Constantine's pro-union stance provoked weakened the defense of Constantinople by creating mistrust between the emperor and key military and religious figures, most notably the Megas Doux Loukas Notaras, who reportedly declared that he would rather see the Turkish turban in Constantinople than the Latin miter.[^75]

Some historians have argued that Constantine lacked the diplomatic skills and political acumen necessary for effective leadership of a state in crisis. His threatening posture toward Sultan Mehmed II in 1452—using the Ottoman prince Orhan, who was held in Constantinople, as a diplomatic weapon—backfired by providing Mehmed with a pretext for war and eliminating any remaining possibility of peaceful coexistence with the Ottoman Empire.[^76] More skillful diplomacy might have delayed the final assault on Constantinople, potentially allowing time for circumstances to change, but Constantine's approach instead precipitated the very conflict he hoped to avoid or defer.

Critics point out that Constantine failed to learn appropriate lessons from the destruction of the Hexamilion wall in 1446. The ease with which Ottoman artillery demolished fortifications that Constantine had believed impregnable should have prompted a fundamental reassessment of defensive strategy and greater investment in counter-battery measures and artillery for Constantinople's defense.[^77] Instead, Constantine appears to have placed excessive faith in Constantinople's land walls without adequately preparing for the kind of sustained artillery bombardment that Mehmed II would employ in 1453. This failure to adapt to the changing technology of siege warfare represented a serious strategic blind spot.

The emperor's inability to secure an heir and his extended absences from Constantinople while searching for a bride have been criticized as reflecting misplaced priorities. During the critical years 1447–1449, when Constantine should have been consolidating his position and preparing for the inevitable Ottoman threat, he was instead preoccupied with matrimonial negotiations that ultimately came to nothing.[^78] His failure to marry and produce children before becoming emperor left succession questions unresolved and contributed to political instability, as evidenced by his brother Demetrios's challenge to his accession.

Some scholars have questioned whether Constantine possessed the vision and inspirational leadership necessary to rally his demoralized subjects. Unlike his father Manuel II, who through force of personality and skillful diplomacy had managed to preserve Byzantine independence for decades despite overwhelming Ottoman power, Constantine appears to have lacked the charisma and political skill to unite the fractured Byzantine elite behind a common strategy.[^79] His genuine personal courage and military competence could not compensate for these deficiencies in leadership and statecraft.

The harshest criticism comes from traditionalist Orthodox Christians who view Constantine's support for church union as a betrayal of Orthodox faith and Byzantine tradition. From this perspective, Constantine sacrificed the spiritual integrity of the Orthodox Church for the false promise of Western military aid, committing theological error and earning divine disfavor.[^80] The fact that Constantine has never been officially canonized as a saint, despite widespread popular veneration, reflects ongoing controversy within the Orthodox Church about his religious choices and their theological implications.
