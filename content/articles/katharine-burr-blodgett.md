## Summary

Katharine Burr Blodgett was the first woman to receive a PhD in physics from Cambridge University and invented non-reflective (invisible) glass. Her Langmuir-Blodgett film technique created molecularly thin coatings that eliminated reflections, used in eyeglasses, camera lenses, and military equipment. She was the first woman hired as a scientist by GE.
