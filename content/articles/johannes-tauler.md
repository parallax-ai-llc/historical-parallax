## Summary

Johannes Tauler was a German Dominican mystic and preacher who was a disciple of Meister Eckhart. He was one of the leading Rhineland mystics whose sermons on the inner life and detachment from the world deeply influenced Christian spirituality. Unlike Eckhart, he avoided condemnation by framing his mysticism in more orthodox terms. His sermons were read by Martin Luther, who found them deeply moving, and they influenced the development of Protestant spirituality.
