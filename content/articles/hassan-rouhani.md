## Summary

Hassan Rouhani served as the seventh President of the Islamic Republic of Iran from 2013 to 2021, representing a moderate faction within the country's political establishment. A career diplomat and Islamic jurist, he rose to prominence as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator and played a pivotal role in international relations during critical periods of Iran's modern history. His presidency was defined by the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, efforts to ease social restrictions, and attempts to improve Iran's economy amid crippling sanctions. Despite initial hopes for reform and opening, his tenure faced significant challenges including economic hardship, internal conservative opposition, and the unraveling of the nuclear agreement following the United States' withdrawal in 2018.

## Early Life and Background

Hassan Rouhani was born Hassan Fereydoun on November 12, 1948, in Sorkheh, a small town near Semnan in northern Iran[^1]. He came from a religious family with modest means; his father was a spice merchant and his mother came from a clerical background. Growing up in a traditional Iranian society during the reign of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Rouhani was exposed to both religious education and the political tensions that would eventually culminate in the Islamic Revolution[^2].

Rouhani began his religious studies at a young age, moving to Qom—Iran's center of Shiite scholarship—in his teenage years to study Islamic jurisprudence. He studied under prominent clerics including Ayatollah Khomeini, who would later lead the Iranian Revolution. During the 1960s and early 1970s, Rouhani became involved in opposition activities against the Shah's regime, participating in demonstrations and distributing underground publications[^3]. This early political activism would shape his future career in revolutionary Iran.

His education was extensive and international in scope. Beyond his religious studies in Qom, Rouhani pursued higher education in law, earning a bachelor's degree from Tehran University in 1972. He later obtained an MPhil in law from Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland in 1995, and completed a PhD in constitutional law from the same institution in 1999, focusing on Islamic law and flexibility[^4]. This combination of traditional Islamic scholarship and Western academic credentials became a defining characteristic of his intellectual profile, positioning him as a bridge between Iran's religious establishment and the international community.

## Rise to Power

Rouhani's ascent in Iranian politics began immediately after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. His early support for Ayatollah Khomeini earned him positions of trust in the new theocratic system. He was elected to the Iranian Parliament (Majlis) in 1980, representing Tehran, and served there for two decades—a period that allowed him to build extensive networks within the regime's power structure[^5]. During the devastating Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), he held several military and political positions, including representing Khomeini on the Supreme Defense Council, which gave him insight into national security affairs[^6].

In 1989, following Khomeini's death and the ascension of Ali Khamenei to Supreme Leader, Rouhani was appointed to the powerful Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), a body responsible for coordinating defense and foreign policy. He would lead this council as Secretary from 1989 to 2005, becoming one of the most influential figures in Iranian security and diplomatic circles[^7]. This role positioned him at the center of Iran's most sensitive national security decisions during a tumultuous period.

Rouhani's reputation as a skilled negotiator crystallized during his tenure as Iran's chief nuclear negotiator from 2003 to 2005 under President Mohammad Khatami. During this period, he managed to negotiate a temporary suspension of Iran's uranium enrichment program with European powers (the UK, France, and Germany), while avoiding referral to the UN Security Council[^8]. Though conservatives later criticized these negotiations as too concessionary, Rouhani demonstrated diplomatic skills that would define his political brand. He wrote extensively about these negotiations in his memoirs, defending a strategy of "heroic flexibility"—a term later endorsed by Supreme Leader Khamenei[^9].

His path to the presidency came somewhat unexpectedly. After losing the 2005 presidential election in the first round and withdrawing from the 2009 race, Rouhani entered the 2013 presidential campaign as a moderate alternative to hardline candidates. Campaigning on promises of economic improvement, nuclear deal resolution, and greater social freedoms, he consolidated the reformist and moderate vote after more explicitly reformist candidates were barred from running[^10]. His surprise first-round victory with 50.7% of the vote signaled public frustration with the economic stagnation and international isolation under his hardline predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad[^11].

## Major Achievements

The crowning achievement of Rouhani's presidency was undoubtedly the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal, reached in July 2015 after nearly two years of intensive negotiations. This landmark agreement between Iran and the P5+1 (the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, China, and Germany) placed strict limits and monitoring on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for relief from economic sanctions[^12]. The deal represented a major diplomatic breakthrough, potentially ending a decade-long standoff that had brought Iran and Western powers to the brink of military confrontation. Rouhani framed the agreement as a victory for Iranian diplomacy, demonstrating that the country could defend its rights while engaging constructively with the international community[^13].

The nuclear deal's implementation in January 2016 brought immediate economic benefits, with billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets released and oil exports resuming. International companies began exploring business opportunities in Iran, and the economy showed signs of recovery with GDP growth reaching 12.5% in 2016[^14]. Rouhani leveraged this initial success to win re-election in 2017 with an even stronger mandate, receiving 57% of the vote against hardline challenger Ebrahim Raisi[^15]. His campaign emphasized moderation, economic progress, and engagement with the world.

On domestic policy, Rouhani introduced incremental social and cultural reforms that, while limited by the constraints of the theocratic system, represented meaningful changes for many Iranians. His administration relaxed enforcement of dress codes, allowed greater freedom for artists and filmmakers, and permitted more diverse voices in media and civil society[^16]. The appointment of women to several cabinet and vice-presidential positions, while symbolic in many respects, signaled a more inclusive approach than previous hardline administrations[^17].

Rouhani also positioned himself as an advocate for civil rights and the rule of law within the Islamic Republic's framework. He publicly criticized the house arrest of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi (detained since 2011 following the disputed 2009 election), though he proved unable to secure their release[^18]. His "Citizens' Rights Charter," unveiled in 2016, outlined protections for individual freedoms, privacy, and due process, though its implementation remained limited[^19]. These gestures, while falling short of fundamental reform, represented an attempt to address public demands for greater rights and freedoms.

In environmental policy, Rouhani's government took steps to address Iran's severe pollution and water crisis problems, signing the Paris Climate Agreement and launching initiatives to reduce Tehran's notorious air pollution[^20]. While environmental degradation remained a serious problem, the administration showed greater awareness of these issues than previous governments.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his moderate image, Rouhani's presidency was marked by significant controversies and failures that disappointed both his supporters and fueled attacks from conservative opponents. The most devastating blow came in May 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the JCPOA and reimposed comprehensive sanctions on Iran, a move that severely undermined Rouhani's central policy achievement[^21]. While the withdrawal was driven by American politics rather than Iranian violations of the agreement, it exposed the vulnerability of Rouhani's diplomatic approach and vindicated hardliners who had warned against trusting Western promises[^22].

The reimposition of U.S. sanctions, combined with broader economic mismanagement, plunged Iran into a severe economic crisis characterized by currency collapse, inflation exceeding 40%, and widespread unemployment[^23]. The Iranian rial lost more than half its value in 2018, devastating ordinary Iranians' purchasing power and savings. Rouhani's promises of economic prosperity through international engagement rang hollow as companies fled the Iranian market to avoid U.S. secondary sanctions. Popular frustration erupted in nationwide protests in late 2017 and again in 2019, with demonstrators explicitly criticizing Rouhani's economic failures[^24].

The government's response to the November 2019 protests marked one of the darkest episodes of Rouhani's presidency. Following demonstrations sparked by gasoline price increases, security forces killed hundreds of protesters in what Amnesty International called a "bloodbath," with estimates ranging from 300 to 1,500 deaths[^25]. Internet access was shut down nationwide for several days. While Rouhani may not have directly ordered the crackdown, which was likely orchestrated by security forces answering to the Supreme Leader, he failed to condemn the violence or protect protesters, revealing the limits of his authority and willingness to challenge the regime's repressive apparatus[^26].

Rouhani's handling of the Ukrainian International Airlines Flight 752 disaster in January 2020 drew widespread condemnation. After Iranian missiles accidentally shot down the civilian airliner shortly after takeoff from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard, the government initially denied responsibility and covered up the truth for three days[^27]. Rouhani later admitted he was informed about the military's role only on the third day, raising questions about either his competence or honesty. The incident and its handling became a symbol of government dishonesty and incompetence[^28].

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed further failures of governance. Iran became one of the worst-affected countries globally, with the government accused of downplaying the crisis, providing inconsistent public health guidance, and failing to procure adequate medical supplies and vaccines[^29]. Rouhani's administration rejected U.S. vaccine offers (which came with political strings) but struggled to secure alternatives, leaving Iran dependent on slower domestic vaccine development[^30]. The pandemic, combined with sanctions, created a humanitarian crisis that the government proved ill-equipped to handle.

Critics on the left accused Rouhani of failing to deliver on promises of political reform and civil liberties. Political prisoners remained jailed throughout his tenure, censorship continued, and the security apparatus maintained its grip on society[^31]. Environmental activists, women's rights advocates, and labor organizers faced arrest and imprisonment under his watch. The much-touted Citizens' Rights Charter remained largely symbolic, with few concrete protections materialized[^32]. Many reformist supporters felt betrayed by what they saw as Rouhani's unwillingness to confront conservative power centers.

Conservative critics, meanwhile, attacked Rouhani for supposed capitulation to the West, economic mismanagement, and corruption. They blamed the nuclear deal for gaining insufficient benefits while surrendering Iran's strategic leverage[^33]. Scandals involving connected businessmen and questionable financial dealings in the administration reinforced perceptions of cronyism, though such corruption was hardly unique to Rouhani's government[^34].

## Personal Life

Hassan Rouhani is married to Sahebeh Arabi, whom he married in the early 1970s before the Islamic Revolution. The couple has maintained a notably private family life, even by the standards of Iranian politics where officials typically shield their families from public scrutiny[^35]. They have four children—two sons and two daughters—who have largely stayed out of the political spotlight, though his daughter Farzaneh studied in the United States, a fact that drew criticism from hardliners who questioned the propriety of sending children to America while denouncing Western influence[^36].

Unlike some Iranian politicians who cultivate populist personas, Rouhani projects an image of scholarly detachment and bureaucratic professionalism. Colleagues and observers describe him as a cautious, calculating figure who prefers working behind the scenes to public grandstanding[^37]. This temperament served him well in diplomatic negotiations but sometimes made him appear disconnected from public concerns during crises. His speaking style is typically measured and technical, lacking the fiery rhetoric common among Iranian revolutionary figures[^38].

Rouhani adopted his surname (meaning "spiritual" or "cleric" in Persian) early in his political career, changing from his birth name Fereydoun to emphasize his religious credentials[^39]. He holds the clerical rank of hujjat al-Islam, a mid-level position in the Shiite religious hierarchy below ayatollah. His religious credentials, while significant, never matched those of Iran's highest clerics, positioning him as a political operator who happens to be a cleric rather than a religious authority who entered politics[^40].

Those who know him describe Rouhani as pragmatic and flexible, willing to compromise and work within the system's constraints rather than challenging them frontally—qualities that enabled his political survival across different administrations but also limited his capacity for transformative change[^41]. He is reportedly fluent in Persian, Arabic, English, and has knowledge of German, reflecting his international education and diplomatic career[^42].

His lifestyle appears modest by the standards of political elites, though comprehensive information about his personal wealth is not publicly available. He has avoided the ostentatious displays of wealth that have tarnished some Iranian officials, instead maintaining the image of a dedicated public servant[^43].

## Legacy

Hassan Rouhani's legacy remains contested and will likely be debated for years to come. His presidency represented an attempt to chart a middle path for Iran—maintaining the Islamic Republic's fundamental character while pursuing engagement with the world and incremental domestic reform. Whether this approach was realistic or doomed from the start remains a central question in assessing his tenure[^44].

The nuclear deal stands as his most significant achievement and biggest failure, a paradox that encapsulates his presidency. The JCPOA demonstrated that diplomacy could resolve seemingly intractable conflicts and that Iran could successfully negotiate with major powers while protecting core interests[^45]. For a time, it appeared to offer a roadmap for Iran's reintegration into the international community and economic recovery. Yet the deal's collapse exposed the fragility of diplomatic achievements when not supported by domestic political consensus in all parties—particularly in the United States. The experience left many Iranians skeptical about the value of engagement with the West[^46].

Economically, Rouhani's legacy is largely negative. Despite the brief boom following sanctions relief, his presidency ended with Iran's economy in severe distress, ordinary Iranians suffering from inflation and unemployment, and the currency in crisis[^47]. While U.S. sanctions bear much responsibility, critics fairly point to structural reforms Rouhani failed to implement, corruption he didn't address, and economic mismanagement that compounded external pressures. The gap between his promises and economic reality became a source of deep public disillusionment[^48].

On social and political reform, Rouhani's record is mixed. He created more breathing room for cultural expression and civil society than hardline predecessors, and his rhetoric validated aspirations for greater rights and freedoms[^49]. However, he failed to challenge the fundamental structures of repression or protect activists and protesters when they faced violence. His presidency demonstrated the limits of reform within the Islamic Republic's constitutional framework, where real power resides with unelected institutions[^50].

Rouhani's inability or unwillingness to confront the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and other conservative power centers proved a defining limitation. These institutions repeatedly undermined his policies, from sabotaging diplomatic initiatives to crushing protests to dominating the economy through corruption[^51]. Whether greater confrontation would have achieved anything or simply ended his presidency prematurely remains an open question, but his accommodation of these forces disappointed supporters who hoped for more assertive leadership[^52].

In the broader sweep of Iranian history, Rouhani may be remembered as a transitional figure who tried and failed to reconcile the Islamic Republic's revolutionary ideology with the practical necessities of governing a modern state in a globalized world. His presidency highlighted the tensions between different visions of Iran's future—engagement versus resistance, openness versus isolation, pragmatism versus ideology—without resolving them[^53].

His legacy also includes the demonstration that electoral politics in Iran, while constrained and imperfect, can produce alternation between different factions and policy approaches. The peaceful transfer of power from Ahmadinejad to Rouhani to the hardliner Ebrahim Raisi shows some institutional resilience, even as the boundaries of permissible politics remain tightly controlled[^54].

For international observers, Rouhani's tenure offered lessons about the possibilities and limits of engagement with authoritarian regimes. The nuclear deal showed that negotiated settlements are possible even with adversarial governments, but sustaining such agreements requires political will that can evaporate with leadership changes[^55].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic analysts credit Rouhani with pursuing realistic policies in extremely difficult circumstances. They argue that his diplomatic approach to the nuclear crisis prevented a disastrous war that hardliners' confrontational stance might have provoked[^56]. The JCPOA, in this view, was a sophisticated agreement that addressed international concerns while preserving Iran's nuclear infrastructure and dignity—a win-win that only collapsed due to Trump's reckless withdrawal rather than any failing of the agreement itself[^57].

Defenders emphasize the structural constraints Rouhani faced as president in a system where the Supreme Leader, security forces, judiciary, and Guardian Council wield decisive power over key policy domains[^58]. From this perspective, Rouhani did what was possible within an authoritarian framework, making incremental progress on social freedoms, women's rights, and civil society where he could. His appointment of reformist ministers and vice presidents created spaces for progressive voices in government, even if transformative change remained impossible[^59].

Some scholars argue that Rouhani represented an important current within the Islamic Republic—technocratic, internationally minded officials who recognize that Iran's long-term interests require engagement with the world rather than perpetual confrontation[^60]. His presidency demonstrated that this faction exists and can win elections, even if it struggles to translate electoral victories into policy success against entrenched conservative opposition.

International relations experts note that Rouhani maintained diplomatic channels with Europe and other powers even after the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, preserving the possibility of future engagement[^61]. His restraint in responding to various provocations—including the U.S. assassination of General Qassem Soleimani—helped prevent escalation into full-scale war, a non-trivial achievement given the dangerous regional dynamics[^62].

Economically, supporters argue that Rouhani inherited deep structural problems from Ahmadinejad and faced unprecedented external pressure through sanctions, making economic success nearly impossible[^63]. They point to the brief period of growth following the nuclear deal as evidence of what was possible when external constraints eased. His emphasis on economic rationality and expertise, even if not fully implemented, represented a marked improvement over the populist mismanagement of his predecessor[^64].

---

### Negative Views

Critics across the political spectrum condemn Rouhani's presidency as a failure that squandered opportunities and betrayed supporters. Reformists and human rights advocates argue that he had a democratic mandate for change but lacked the courage to confront the regime's repressive apparatus[^65]. His silence during the brutal crackdowns on protests, continued imprisonment of political activists and journalists, and failure to challenge the IRGC's dominance revealed him as ultimately a regime insider unwilling to risk his position for principles he claimed to hold[^66].

The economic collapse under his watch drew harsh criticism. Even accounting for sanctions, analysts point to specific failures: inability to control corruption, failure to reduce state dominance of the economy, lack of meaningful privatization or structural reform, and mismanagement of the oil windfall during the brief sanctions relief period[^67]. The gap between his rhetoric of economic expertise and the reality of continued cronyism and inefficiency undermined public trust in government competence[^68].

Conservative critics within Iran view the nuclear deal as a catastrophic strategic mistake that surrendered leverage for empty promises[^69]. They argue that Rouhani's eagerness for agreement led him to accept terms that constrained Iran's nuclear program while delivering insufficient sanctions relief, and that the deal was always vulnerable to U.S. repudiation. From this perspective, Iran would have been better served by maintaining its program and building economic resilience to withstand sanctions[^70].

International human rights organizations documented continued grave abuses during Rouhani's tenure, including executions, torture, arbitrary detention, and persecution of minorities[^71]. His government's record on human rights showed little improvement over previous administrations, contradicting his moderate image. The violent suppression of protests in 2019, with security forces massacring hundreds of demonstrators, stands as a permanent stain on his legacy[^72].

Some analysts argue that Rouhani's fundamental approach was flawed—that the Islamic Republic's system is unreformable from within, and that his efforts to work within it only served to legitimize and perpetuate authoritarian rule[^73]. By offering the facade of moderation and reform without substance, he may have actually strengthened the regime by channeling dissent into ineffective electoral politics rather than fundamental challenges to the system[^74].

The COVID-19 disaster revealed catastrophic governance failures, with mixed messages, inadequate public health measures, and conspiracy theories spreading from government sources contributing to Iran's tragically high death toll[^75]. Rouhani's handling of the pandemic demonstrated that technocratic competence, which was supposed to be his strength, was largely absent when most needed[^76].

Former supporters who voted for him in 2013 and 2017 express a sense of betrayal, feeling that he promised change and delivered stagnation, promised prosperity and delivered economic crisis, promised rights and delivered repression[^77]. This disillusionment has contributed to widespread political apathy in Iran, with turnout in the 2021 presidential election dropping to historic lows as many concluded that voting for moderates achieves nothing[^78].
