## Summary

Saw Ba U Gyi (1905–1950) was a Cambridge-educated Karen lawyer, statesman, and revolutionary leader who founded and served as the first President of the Karen National Union (KNU)[^1]. Born into a wealthy S'gaw Karen family in the Irrawaddy Delta, he served as Minister of Revenue in British Burma (1937-1939) before leading the armed struggle for Karen independence after Burma's independence in 1948[^2]. He is best remembered for articulating the "Four Principles" that continue to guide Karen nationalist aspirations[^3]. Saw Ba U Gyi was killed in disputed circumstances by Burmese Army forces on August 12, 1950, and his death is commemorated annually as Karen Martyrs' Day[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Saw Ba U Gyi was born in 1905 in Begayek village, located in the Bassein (now Pathein) district of the Irrawaddy Delta region of British Burma[^5]. He came from a prosperous S'gaw Karen family, one of the major subgroups within the broader Karen ethnic community. His father, Saw Tha Myat Gyi, was a wealthy landowner and village headman who maintained peaceful relations between the Karen and Burman communities in their mixed village, though the two groups inhabited separate areas with limited interaction[^6][^7].

As the youngest of five siblings with two older brothers and two younger sisters, Saw Ba U Gyi grew up in an environment of relative privilege and stability[^8]. His father belonged to a Christian Sgaw Karen family and supported community development projects, including the Ko Tha Byu Bassein Sgaw Karen High School[^9]. This Christian missionary education would profoundly influence the young Ba U Gyi's worldview and future political orientation.

The family's economic security enabled Saw Ba U Gyi to pursue an exceptional education. After completing his early schooling in Burma, he graduated from Rangoon University in 1925[^10]. At the age of 16 in 1921, he traveled from Burma to the United Kingdom to pursue higher education, initially spending a preparatory year studying Latin in London to meet entrance requirements for university[^11]. He subsequently enrolled at Magdalene College, University of Cambridge, where he completed a bachelor's degree in law in 1925[^12].

Following his Cambridge education, Saw Ba U Gyi joined the prestigious Middle Temple in central London to train as a barrister. He was called to the bar in 1929, becoming one of the first Karen barristers trained in English law[^13][^14]. During his time in England, he married Renee Rose Kemp in 1926, and the couple had two children together[^15]. This period in England exposed him to Western legal principles, democratic institutions, and nationalist movements that would later shape his political philosophy.

Saw Ba U Gyi returned to Burma in 1929 following his admission to the English bar and established a successful law practice in Bassein[^16]. Photos from this period show him wearing Western-style suits and driving a Ford V-8, symbols of his cosmopolitan education and upper-class status[^17]. He spent his free time exchanging ideas with students and teachers from the Karen High School and playing football and golf, maintaining connections with both the educated Karen elite and the broader community[^18].

## Rise to Power

Saw Ba U Gyi's entry into formal politics began during the late 1930s, a period of significant political change in British Burma. In 1937, he joined the government of Prime Minister Ba Maw as Minister of Revenue when Burma was separated from British India and granted a degree of self-governance[^19][^20]. He served in this capacity from 1937 to 1939, gaining valuable experience in colonial administration and developing relationships with both British officials and Burmese nationalist leaders.

During World War II, the Karen people's fate diverged dramatically from that of the majority Burman population. When the Japanese invaded Burma in 1942, presenting themselves as liberators from colonial rule, they were welcomed by many Burmese nationalists, including the Burma Independence Army led by General Aung San[^21]. However, the Karen, along with other frontier minorities, remained fiercely loyal to the British, whom they had been favored under during colonial rule[^22]. This loyalty came at an enormous cost: Karen communities suffered massacres and village destruction at the hands of both the Japanese Imperial Army and the Burma Independence Army. In the Myaungmya District alone, the official report put the Karen death toll at 1,800 villagers in communal attacks[^23].

Some 12,000 Karen and Karenni in the southeast joined the British-trained Karen Levies and underground Force 136, serving with British officers behind enemy lines in guerrilla operations[^24]. These units inflicted more than 12,000 fatalities on the retreating Japanese armies during 1945[^25]. This wartime experience created a deep bond between Karen fighters and the British, while simultaneously deepening the rift with Burman nationalists who had initially collaborated with the Japanese.

During the war, in 1942, Saw Ba U Gyi's wife and two young children fled Burma, first traveling to India before settling in the United Kingdom on a weeks-long journey from Bombay by ship[^26]. When Saw Ba U Gyi arrived in London in August 1946 as part of a Karen delegation, he was reunited with his family for what would prove to be the final time[^27]. According to his grandson Paul Sztumpf, "all members of the family had changed, but he was very disappointed in his son, who did not wish to support his father"[^28]. Faced with a difficult choice, Saw Ba U Gyi agreed to divorce his wife and returned to Burma alone in 1946, prioritizing his political mission over his family[^29].

In 1944, Saw Ba U Gyi had joined the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), the coalition struggling for Burmese independence from Britain[^30]. However, he grew increasingly disillusioned with the AFPFL's vision for post-independence Burma. In early 1947, he briefly returned to government service, serving as Minister of Transport and Communications from February to April 1947 in the pre-independence cabinet[^31].

The critical turning point came with the Panglong Agreement, signed on February 12, 1947, between Aung San and leaders of the Shan, Kachin, and Chin peoples[^32]. This agreement granted significant autonomy to these ethnic groups within a future Union of Burma. However, the Karen were conspicuously absent from this historic accord. The Karen delegation attended the Panglong Conference only as observers, divided between those who supported the AFPFL and those who favored complete separation from Burma[^33][^34]. Many Karen leaders hoped for a separate Karen State within the British Empire rather than inclusion in an independent Burma dominated by the Burman majority[^35].

The Aung San-Attlee agreement of January 27, 1947, which gave Aung San and the AFPFL rule over Burma, made no provisions for Karen autonomy[^36]. This exclusion, combined with memories of wartime massacres and fears of Burman domination, brought any hope for peaceful Karen integration to an end. Saw Ba U Gyi resigned from his cabinet position and from the AFPFL in protest[^37].

Between February 5 and 7, 1947, approximately 700 delegates from diverse Karen organizations—including the Karen National Association (KNA), Baptist KNA, Buddhist Karen National Association (BKNA), Karen Central Organization (KCO), and the Karen Youth Organization (KYO)—gathered at Vinton Memorial Hall in Rangoon[^38][^39]. At this historic congress, they merged to form the Karen National Union (KNU), with the foundational aim of securing a sovereign Karen state[^40]. The newly formed KNU made several key demands: representation in government, a seaboard on their own land, and all-Karen units in the armed forces[^41].

The KNU's first chairman was Saw San Po Thin, but he resigned after just two months to take up a cabinet position in the new Burmese government[^42][^43]. Saw Ba U Gyi then assumed leadership of the KNU, becoming its president and the principal advocate for Karen self-determination. His legal training, government experience, ministerial background, and growing frustration with AFPFL policies positioned him as the natural leader of the Karen nationalist movement.

## Major Achievements

Saw Ba U Gyi's primary achievement was the establishment and leadership of the Karen National Union as a cohesive political and military organization representing Karen aspirations for self-determination. Under his presidency, the KNU evolved from a loose coalition of Karen groups into a structured nationalist movement with clear political objectives and military capabilities[^44].

His most enduring contribution was the articulation of the "Four Principles of the Karen Revolution," which he formalized at a KNU congress held in July 1950 at Papun, just one month before his death[^45]. These principles became the ideological foundation of the Karen nationalist movement and remain the guiding principles of the KNU to this day:

1. **Surrender is out of the question** – An uncompromising commitment to the Karen cause regardless of military setbacks
2. **The recognition of the Karen State must be complete** – A demand for full sovereignty rather than mere autonomy
3. **We shall retain our arms** – Rejection of disarmament until political objectives are achieved
4. **We shall decide our own political destiny** – Assertion of the Karen people's right to self-determination without external interference[^46][^47][^48]

These principles, publicly outlined by Saw Ba U Gyi in speeches and KNU declarations during 1947–1949, emphasized an unyielding commitment to Karen statehood[^49]. They provided a clear ideological framework that has sustained the Karen resistance movement for more than seven decades, making it one of the world's longest-running insurgencies.

Saw Ba U Gyi also developed a three-pronged strategic approach for the Karen struggle for freedom and autonomy: (1) armed struggle, (2) political dialogue for a negotiated settlement with the Burmese government, and (3) international intervention or arrangement for the Karen people[^50]. This multi-faceted strategy demonstrated his pragmatic recognition that military force alone would not achieve Karen independence, and that diplomatic and international pressure would be essential.

As tensions escalated in 1948, Saw Ba U Gyi oversaw the transformation of the Karen National Defence Organisation (KNDO), which had been formed around the time of Burmese independence as the armed wing of the KNU[^51]. The KNDO consisted primarily of World War II veterans who had served in British Burma's forces and the Karen Levies[^52]. Under Saw Ba U Gyi's leadership, the KNDO evolved from a defensive militia into an offensive revolutionary army.

Following a series of retaliatory incidents and massacres—including a Bamar militia killing 200 Karens during a Christmas eve service in a Palaw church—tensions reached a breaking point[^53]. Karen militias took over Thaton and Kyaikkami in August 1948, and on August 30, the KNDO seized Thaton and Moulmein[^54].

On January 27, 1949, Colonel Min Maung's First Karen Rifles seized the strategically important town of Taungoo[^55][^56]. The following day, Karen naval commander Saw Jack attacked Pathein and other Karen troops seized Pyu[^57]. By early 1949, the KNDO had taken control of multiple major towns including Mandalay, Pyin Oo Lwin, Meiktila, and several others, with their forces reaching and occupying Insein Township in the north of Yangon[^58].

On January 30, 1949, the KNDO was outlawed by the government, and Karen personnel were purged from the army two days later, with Prime Minister Nu expelling all Karen leaders from their military posts and replacing the Karen general Smith Dun with the Burman officer Ne Win[^59][^60]. On January 31, 1949, the KNU officially declared war on the Burmese government[^61][^62].

On June 14, 1949, Saw Ba U Gyi announced in a radio broadcast the establishment of a free country called Kawthoolei (meaning "land without darkness"), proclaiming the Karen Free State's independence from Burma[^63][^64][^65]. This declaration represented the culmination of Saw Ba U Gyi's efforts to establish a sovereign Karen nation. At its peak, the Karen rebellion controlled significant territory and posed a serious military threat to the newly independent Burmese state.

The KNU under Saw Ba U Gyi's leadership demonstrated remarkable military capability. The government retook Taungoo only in March 1949 and Insein in May 1949, after heavy losses on both sides[^66]. The Karen forces' ability to seize and hold major population centers, even temporarily, demonstrated the effectiveness of Saw Ba U Gyi's organizational and strategic leadership.

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Saw Ba U Gyi is revered as a founding father by the Karen people, his leadership and strategic decisions have been subject to significant criticism from various perspectives. The most substantial criticism came from British and Burmese government officials who viewed his approach as inflexible and counterproductive.

Lord Listowel, a British Labour minister, accused Saw Ba U Gyi of "obstinacy" and of "gambling on the fighting qualities of the Karens," characterizing him as unable to compromise[^67][^68]. This British perspective suggested that Saw Ba U Gyi was "a stupid man 'Who could not see the other fellow's point of view,'" though this characterization was considered unwarranted by his supporters[^69]. These criticisms reflected the British government's interest in a stable, unified Burma after independence and their frustration with Saw Ba U Gyi's refusal to accept Karen incorporation into the Union of Burma without guarantees of statehood.

From Burmese government perspectives, Saw Ba U Gyi's Four Principles have been viewed as intransigent, prolonging conflict without viable diplomatic paths[^70]. Critics argue that his uncompromising stance—particularly the principle that "surrender is out of the question"—made negotiated settlement virtually impossible and committed the Karen people to a protracted armed struggle that has now lasted more than 75 years. This prolonged conflict has resulted in enormous suffering for Karen civilians, including displacement, refugee crises, and continued violence.

The decision to launch armed rebellion in January 1949, just one year after Burma's independence, has been questioned by some analysts. The timing meant that the Karen forces faced a fragile but internationally recognized government that had the backing of newly independent India and other nations. While the KNDO achieved initial military successes, they were unable to consolidate their gains or win international recognition for Kawthoolei. The government's superior resources and international legitimacy eventually enabled it to retake lost territory, though complete military victory proved elusive.

Saw Ba U Gyi's personal life also generated some controversy. His decision to divorce his English wife Renee Rose Kemp and abandon his two children in England in 1946 to pursue the Karen nationalist cause reflected the sacrifices he believed were necessary, but it also revealed the personal costs of his uncompromising political commitment[^71]. According to his grandson, there was family disappointment and estrangement, particularly with his son who did not wish to support his father's political mission[^72].

The Myanmar government has consistently sought to diminish Saw Ba U Gyi's legacy, banning the use of the term "martyr" in reference to him on multiple occasions[^73][^74]. The Irrawaddy regional government has explicitly forbidden the use of the term "Karen Martyr," reflecting ongoing political tensions about how he should be remembered and honored[^75]. This suppression of commemoration efforts indicates the extent to which Saw Ba U Gyi's legacy remains threatening to the central government's narrative of national unity.

Some scholars have noted that "the history and legacy of revolutionary leader Saw Ba U Gyi is little-known outside, or inside, Myanmar"[^76]. This limited recognition, even within Myanmar itself, suggests that his legacy remains contested and politically sensitive rather than being integrated into mainstream national history.

The decision to launch armed struggle also had consequences for Karen unity. The Karen community was deeply divided between those who supported armed resistance and those who sought accommodation with the Burmese state. This division weakened Karen political power and contributed to internal conflicts that have plagued Karen politics for decades.

Finally, the geographic aspirations embodied in the declaration of Kawthoolei were problematic. The proposed Karen state included areas with mixed populations and significant non-Karen communities, raising questions about whether Karen self-determination could be achieved without creating new minority populations subject to Karen rule. These territorial ambitions complicated negotiations and made compromise more difficult.

## Personal Life

Saw Ba U Gyi's personal life was marked by the tension between his Western education and family connections in England and his deepening commitment to Karen nationalism. During his legal studies in England in the 1920s, he married Renee Rose Kemp in 1926, an English woman with whom he had two children[^77][^78]. This intercultural marriage reflected his cosmopolitan outlook and integration into British society during his formative years.

The family lived in England during the 1930s and early 1940s. When World War II erupted and the Japanese invaded Burma in 1942, Renee and their two young children fled Burma to India before eventually settling in the United Kingdom, undertaking a perilous weeks-long journey from Bombay by ship[^79]. The family's separation during the war years took a significant toll on their relationships.

When Saw Ba U Gyi arrived in London in August 1946 as part of a Karen delegation seeking British support for Karen autonomy, he was reunited with his family after years of separation[^80]. However, this reunion revealed the profound changes that time and distance had wrought. According to his grandson Paul Sztumpf, "all members of the family had changed, but he was very disappointed in his son, who did not wish to support his father"[^81]. The cultural and political divide between Saw Ba U Gyi's mission and his family's life in England had become unbridgeable.

Faced with an impossible choice between his family and his political mission, Saw Ba U Gyi made the painful decision to divorce Renee Rose Kemp and return to Burma alone in 1946[^82]. This decision reflected his unwavering commitment to the Karen cause, but it also imposed enormous personal costs. He would never see his wife or children again, spending the final four years of his life dedicated entirely to the Karen nationalist movement.

Photographs from his time in Burma in the 1930s show Saw Ba U Gyi as a man of considerable style and sophistication, wearing Western suits and driving a Ford V-8[^83]. He maintained an active social life, playing football and golf and exchanging ideas with teachers and students from Karen educational institutions[^84]. These activities suggest a gregarious personality and a commitment to maintaining connections with both the Karen elite and broader community institutions.

Despite criticisms from British officials who characterized him as "obstinate" and inflexible[^85], those who worked with Saw Ba U Gyi within the Karen movement viewed him as a committed politician who repeatedly voiced the Karen cause in negotiations with both the British and the post-independence Burma government[^86]. His legal training and ministerial experience gave him credibility as a negotiator, even as his unwavering principles limited the scope for compromise.

Saw Ba U Gyi spent his final months living in harsh jungle conditions, far from the comfortable life he had known as a Cambridge-educated lawyer and government minister. He traveled with other KNU leaders near the border with Thailand, organizing resistance and articulating his vision for Karen independence. The contrast between his earlier life of privilege and his final circumstances as a hunted revolutionary leader underscores the depth of his commitment to the Karen cause.

## Legacy

Saw Ba U Gyi's death on August 12, 1950, transformed him from a political leader into a martyr and symbol of Karen resistance. The anniversary of his death is commemorated annually as Karen Martyrs' Day, with ceremonies held in Karen-controlled areas of Myanmar, Thai refugee camps, and diaspora communities around the world[^87][^88][^89]. These commemorations typically include speeches, prayers, and wreath-laying at memorials, honoring not only Saw Ba U Gyi but all those who have fought for the Karen cause[^90].

The 2024 celebration marked the 74th anniversary of Karen Martyrs' Day, and the 75th anniversary in 2025 occurred amid active military operations against the Myanmar junta, with Karen forces controlling significant territory while collaborating with other revolutionary groups[^91][^92]. This ongoing struggle demonstrates that Saw Ba U Gyi's vision of Karen self-determination remains unfulfilled but actively pursued.

Up to today, Saw Ba U Gyi remains the face of the Karen rebellion[^93]. His photograph—a famous black and white image showing him wearing a beret and staring intently into the camera, similar to the iconic Che Guevara image—is omnipresent in KNU-influenced areas, displayed in people's homes, public buildings, and especially during celebrations[^94][^95]. This visual iconography has made him an enduring symbol of resistance across generations.

His Four Principles continue to serve as the guiding ideology of the Karen National Union[^96][^97]. In 2022, on Karen Martyrs' Day, the KNU reaffirmed its commitment to Saw Ba U Gyi's principle that "We shall decide our own political destiny," demonstrating the continuing relevance of his ideological framework[^98]. These principles have provided ideological continuity through decades of conflict, leadership changes, and shifting political contexts.

The Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), the military wing of the KNU, has repeatedly vowed to achieve the goals set by Saw Ba U Gyi[^99]. This commitment has sustained what is now recognized as one of the world's longest-running civil conflicts, with Karen nationalists fighting for the independent state of Kawthoolei since 1949—over 75 years of continuous armed struggle[^100][^101].

Saw Ba U Gyi's legacy extends beyond the Karen community. His articulation of ethnic minority rights and self-determination in Burma/Myanmar has influenced other ethnic armed organizations and movements. The current resistance to the Myanmar military junta, particularly since the 2021 coup, has seen renewed interest in Saw Ba U Gyi's model of principled resistance and armed struggle combined with political objectives.

The Myanmar government's persistent efforts to suppress commemoration of Saw Ba U Gyi—including banning the use of the term "martyr" in reference to him—paradoxically reinforces his significance[^102][^103]. In 2021, the military junta forbade celebration of Karen Martyrs' Day in Saw Ba U Gyi's birthplace, demonstrating that his legacy remains threatening to the central government more than 70 years after his death[^104].

Recent developments in 2026 have demonstrated the continuing power of Saw Ba U Gyi's vision. On January 5, 2026, the son of the late Karen leader Gen. Bo Mya declared the creation of a "Republic of Kawthoolei," proclaiming its independence from Myanmar 77 years after Saw Ba U Gyi's original declaration[^105][^106]. While the Karen National Union dismissed this declaration as having no legitimacy[^107], the fact that such declarations continue to be made demonstrates the enduring appeal of Saw Ba U Gyi's vision of an independent Karen state.

Saw Ba U Gyi's educational achievement as one of the first Karen barristers trained at Cambridge and the Middle Temple also established a model of Karen excellence and aspiration[^108]. His success in navigating both British and Burmese political systems demonstrated that Karen leaders could compete at the highest levels of education and governance.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Saw Ba U Gyi is widely celebrated within Karen communities as the founding father of the modern Karen nationalist movement and a visionary leader who articulated an enduring framework for Karen self-determination[^109]. Karen historians and community leaders view his Four Principles as a timeless statement of Karen aspirations that remains as relevant today as when it was first articulated in 1950[^110].

Supporters emphasize his personal sacrifices for the Karen cause, including abandoning a comfortable life, a successful legal career, and his family in England to lead the resistance movement[^111]. His willingness to live in jungle conditions and ultimately die for his principles has made him an inspirational figure for generations of Karen activists and fighters.

His legal and political expertise is recognized as having given the Karen nationalist movement intellectual credibility and organizational structure. As a Cambridge-educated barrister and former government minister, Saw Ba U Gyi brought a level of sophistication to Karen nationalism that commanded respect from international observers and provided the KNU with experienced leadership[^112].

The longevity of the Karen resistance movement, now exceeding 75 years, is often cited as evidence of the strength of the foundation that Saw Ba U Gyi established[^113]. The KNU remains the oldest continuously operating ethnic armed organization in Myanmar, a testament to the organizational structures and ideological principles he established.

Karen scholars argue that Saw Ba U Gyi was prescient in recognizing that the Karen people would not receive fair treatment in a Burman-dominated independent Burma[^114]. The decades of subsequent conflict, discrimination, and violence against Karen communities are seen by supporters as vindicating his decision to pursue independence rather than accept integration into the Union of Burma.

His strategic thinking, particularly his three-pronged approach of armed struggle, political negotiation, and international engagement, is praised as sophisticated and forward-looking[^115]. Contemporary Karen leaders continue to employ variations of this multi-faceted strategy in their ongoing struggle.

Within the broader context of anti-colonial and minority rights movements, Saw Ba U Gyi is viewed by some scholars as an important figure in the history of ethnic self-determination struggles in Southeast Asia. His articulation of minority rights in the post-colonial context anticipated many of the ethnic conflicts that would plague the region for decades[^116].

### Negative Views

Critics, particularly from Burmese nationalist perspectives and some Western scholars, argue that Saw Ba U Gyi's uncompromising stance prolonged conflict unnecessarily and foreclosed opportunities for negotiated solutions that might have achieved significant Karen autonomy within a federal Burma[^117]. The principle that "surrender is out of the question" is seen by critics as having locked the Karen people into a military struggle they could not win, resulting in decades of suffering for Karen civilians.

Lord Listowel's contemporary criticism that Saw Ba U Gyi was guilty of "obstinacy" and "gambling on the fighting qualities of the Karens" reflects a perspective that he overestimated Karen military capabilities and underestimated the costs of prolonged conflict[^118][^119]. Critics argue that a more pragmatic leader might have negotiated a settlement that, while falling short of full independence, could have secured meaningful autonomy and spared the Karen people decades of war.

Some scholars question whether Saw Ba U Gyi's vision of an independent Kawthoolei was ever realistic given the geopolitical realities of post-colonial Southeast Asia. No country recognized the 1949 declaration of independence, and the international community consistently supported Burma's territorial integrity. Critics argue that pursuing an unachievable goal has been counterproductive for Karen welfare[^120].

The fact that "the history and legacy of revolutionary leader Saw Ba U Gyi is little-known outside, or inside, Myanmar" has been interpreted by some as evidence that his impact was more limited than Karen nationalist narratives suggest[^121]. His failure to secure international support or recognition for the Karen cause is seen as a significant strategic failure.

Critics also point to the costs of the armed struggle for Karen civilians, including displacement, refugee crises, destruction of communities, and the militarization of Karen society. By 2024, hundreds of thousands of Karen people have been displaced by conflict, and Karen communities have been fractured by decades of war. Some argue that Saw Ba U Gyi's legacy is one of endless conflict rather than liberation[^122].

The Myanmar government's perspective, while heavily biased, portrays Saw Ba U Gyi as a separatist who undermined national unity and committed treason against the newly independent state[^123]. This view, while serving state propaganda purposes, reflects genuine Burmese concerns about territorial integrity and ethnic fragmentation.

Some scholars have noted divisions within Karen society over Saw Ba U Gyi's strategy, with significant numbers of Karen people choosing to remain in government service or seek accommodation with the Burmese state rather than join the armed struggle[^124]. This suggests that his vision was not universally embraced even within the Karen community.

Finally, critics note that the Karen nationalist movement under Saw Ba U Gyi's ideological framework has been unable to adapt to changing circumstances or seriously pursue political solutions. The Four Principles, while providing ideological clarity, may have also limited strategic flexibility and prevented the kind of pragmatic compromises that have allowed other ethnic armed organizations to negotiate ceasefires and participate in political processes[^125].
