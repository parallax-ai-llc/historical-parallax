## Overview

The O.J. Simpson murder trial (1995) was the most-watched criminal trial in American history—dubbed "The Trial of the Century." Former NFL star and actor O.J. Simpson was charged with the brutal murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman on June 12, 1994. The trial became a national obsession, watched by 100 million Americans for the verdict. After nine months and the famous "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit" glove demonstration, the predominantly Black jury found Simpson not guilty in just four hours. The verdict exposed deep racial divisions in American society about police, justice, and celebrity. Simpson was later found liable in civil court and ordered to pay $33.5 million.

Overwhelming—blood matched Simpson. But defense argued contamination, poor handling.

Detective. Defense exposed past racist statements (N-word on tape). Suggested he planted evidence.

Prosecution had Simpson try on bloody glove. It appeared not to fit.
