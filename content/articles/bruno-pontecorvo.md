## Summary

Bruno Pontecorvo was an Italian nuclear physicist who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950. He was one of Enrico Fermi's students and made fundamental contributions to neutrino physics, including predicting neutrino oscillations decades before their experimental confirmation. His prediction that neutrinos could change type was verified by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998.
