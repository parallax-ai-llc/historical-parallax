## Summary

Jiddu Krishnamurti was an Indian philosopher and spiritual teacher who rejected all organized religion, ideology, and authority as obstacles to truth. Groomed by the Theosophical Society as the coming World Teacher, he dissolved the organization created for him in 1929. He spent over 60 years giving talks worldwide on the nature of the mind and freedom. His radical rejection of all spiritual authority made him a unique figure in modern religious history.
