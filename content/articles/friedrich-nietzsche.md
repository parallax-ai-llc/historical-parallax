## Summary

Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900) was a German philosopher whose radical critiques of morality, religion, and culture profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, theology, psychology, and art. His proclamation "God is dead" signaled the collapse of traditional values in modernity. Developing concepts of the Übermensch (overman/superman), the will to power, eternal recurrence, and master-slave morality, Nietzsche challenged Christianity, democracy, and conventional ethics. Though misappropriated by Nazis (through his sister's distortions), Nietzsche's philosophy emphasized individual self-overcoming, creativity, and life-affirmation. His aphoristic style, psychological insights, and ferocious rhetoric made him one of history's most provocative and quotable thinkers.

**Format:** Philosophical novel/prose poem

**Key Concepts:**
- **Übermensch** (overman/superman): One who creates own values, transcends herd morality
- **Eternal Recurrence**: Would you live your life infinitely? Ultimate affirmation
- **Death of God**: Traditional values collapsed; must create new meaning

**Famous:** "God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him."

## Key Concepts

### Death of God

Traditional religious and metaphysical foundations of Western values have collapsed. Modernity faces nihilism crisis. Must create new values.

### Übermensch (Overman)

Not biological superman, but person who:
- Creates own values
- Overcomes herd mentality
- Affirms life fully
- Channels will to power creatively

### Will to Power

Fundamental drive—not mere survival or pleasure. Creative self-overcoming, striving, growth.

### Eternal Recurrence

Thought experiment: If you had to live your life identically forever, would you affirm it? Ultimate test of life-affirmation.

### Master-Slave Morality

- **Master morality**: Strong create values—good = noble, powerful; bad = weak
- **Slave morality**: Weak resent strong—good = humble, meek; evil = powerful

Christianity reversed values, "slave revolt" triumphed.

## Personal Life

**Health:**
Lifelong illness (migraines, near-blindness, digestive problems). Forced to resign professorship (1879), age 34.

**Wandering:**
Spent 1879-1889 wandering—Switzerland, Italy, France—writing in cheap pensions despite illness.

**Wagner:**
Early friend/mentor (composer Richard Wagner). Later bitter break; attacked Wagner's nationalism, Christianity.

**Relationships:**
Never married. Proposed to Lou Salomé (1882); rejected. Close to sister Elisabeth (later distorted his legacy).

**Collapse (1889):**
In Turin, collapsed witnessing horse being whipped. Letters signed "Dionysus" or "The Crucified." Complete mental breakdown—possibly syphilis, brain tumor, or hereditary condition.

**Final Years:**
Cared for by mother, then sister. Unaware of growing fame. Died August 25, 1900, age 55.

## Misappropriation

**Elisabeth and the Nazis:**
Sister Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche (anti-Semitic, Nazi sympathizer) edited his works after his death. *The Will to Power* (compiled posthumously) distorted. Nazis claimed Nietzsche.

**Reality:**
Nietzsche despised German nationalism, anti-Semitism. Called sister's husband "stupid." Writings often misquoted; full context shows different meaning.

- Postmodernism (Foucault, Derrida)
- Psychology (Freud acknowledged debts)

**Culture:**
