## Summary

Shammai was a Jewish scholar and the founder of the House of Shammai, one of the two major schools of thought in early rabbinic Judaism alongside the House of Hillel. He was known for his strict interpretation of Jewish law, in contrast to Hillel's more lenient approach. The debates between the schools of Hillel and Shammai are among the most important in the Talmud. Though the law usually follows Hillel, Shammai's rigor enriched Jewish legal thought.
