## Summary

Donald Glaser invented the bubble chamber in 1952, which replaced the cloud chamber as the primary detector for high-energy physics experiments. His device made particle tracks visible as trails of bubbles in superheated liquid. He received the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics at age 34 and later switched to molecular biology.
