## Summary

Thomas Hunt Morgan was an American geneticist and embryologist who won the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries concerning the role of chromosomes in heredity. His experiments with fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) established the chromosomal theory of inheritance. He demonstrated that genes are located on chromosomes in a linear arrangement. Morgan's fly room at Columbia University became a landmark in the history of genetics.
