## Summary

Adam Smith (baptized June 5, 1723 – July 17, 1790) was a Scottish economist and philosopher widely regarded as the father of modern economics and capitalism.[^1] His two seminal works, *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* (1759) and *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations* (1776), fundamentally shaped economic thought and moral philosophy during the Scottish Enlightenment and continue to influence contemporary economics, politics, and social theory.[^2] Smith's concepts of the "invisible hand," division of labor, and critique of mercantilism laid the groundwork for classical economics, though his nuanced views on markets, morality, and government have often been oversimplified or misappropriated by later thinkers.[^3][^4]

## Early Life and Background

Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland, in early 1723, with his exact birth date unknown but his baptism recorded on June 5, 1723 (Old Style calendar).[^5] His father, also named Adam Smith, was a Writer to the Signet (senior solicitor), advocate, prosecutor, and comptroller of customs in Kirkcaldy, but died approximately five months before his son was born, leaving his mother Margaret Douglas, daughter of a substantial landowner, to raise him alone.[^6][^7] The young Smith would never know his father, and his mother remained a profound influence throughout his life, with whom he lived until her death six years before his own.[^8]

At the time of Smith's birth, Kirkcaldy was a small but thriving port town with a population of around 1,500 people, engaged in trade and manufacturing.[^9] Smith's childhood in Kirkcaldy was largely uneventful, though one notable incident occurred when he was approximately four years old: according to his biographer John Rae, Smith was briefly abducted by Romani people (then called "gypsies") before being rescued.[^10] From 1729 to 1737, Smith attended the Burgh School of Kirkcaldy under the tutelage of David Miller, where he studied Latin, mathematics, history, and writing—subjects that would form the foundation of his later intellectual pursuits.[^11]

In 1737, at the remarkably young age of fourteen, Smith entered the University of Glasgow, where he studied moral philosophy under the influential Francis Hutcheson, who served as Professor of Moral Philosophy.[^12][^13] Hutcheson was a major advocate of moral sense theory and a charismatic lecturer whose magnetic personality and ethical theories profoundly shaped Smith's intellectual development.[^14][^15] At Glasgow, all students followed broadly the same curriculum, and Smith would have studied logic, metaphysics (which included mathematics), moral philosophy, and natural philosophy.[^16] Smith later described Hutcheson as "the never to be forgotten," reflecting the depth of his mentor's influence.[^17]

In 1740, Smith won the prestigious Snell Exhibition scholarship, which allowed him to undertake postgraduate studies at Balliol College, Oxford.[^18][^19] The Snell Exhibition was an annual scholarship awarded to students of the University of Glasgow, founded by the bequest of Sir John Snell in 1677.[^20] However, Smith's six years at Oxford (1740-1746) proved intellectually disappointing compared to the stimulating atmosphere of Glasgow.[^21] He considered the teaching at Glasgow far superior to that at Oxford, which he found intellectually stifling, and later criticized Oxford's tutorial system in *The Wealth of Nations*.[^22] Nevertheless, Smith used his time at Oxford productively, teaching himself several subjects by reading extensively from the large Bodleian Library.[^23] He left Oxford in 1746, before completing his scholarship, and returned to Kirkcaldy.[^24]

## Rise to Power

After returning from Oxford in 1746, Smith spent two years in Kirkcaldy before embarking on the path that would establish his intellectual reputation. In 1748, at the invitation of Henry Home, Lord Kames (1696-1782), a prominent Scottish philosopher and judge, Smith began delivering a series of public lectures in Edinburgh on rhetoric and belles-lettres (literature).[^25][^26] These lectures, sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under Lord Kames's patronage, proved highly successful and covered a broad range of subjects including literary criticism, the arts of speaking and writing, the history of philosophy, and jurisprudence.[^27][^28] Between 1748 and 1751, Smith expanded the content of these lectures to include "the progress of opulence," laying the groundwork for his later economic theories.[^29]

The success of Smith's Edinburgh lectures, combined with the support of the powerful Duke of Argyll, led to his appointment in 1751 to the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics at the University of Glasgow, his alma mater.[^30][^31] However, Smith held this position for only one year. In 1752, when the Chair of Moral Philosophy—the position previously held by his beloved mentor Francis Hutcheson—became vacant, Smith was appointed to fill it.[^32][^33] This appointment marked the beginning of what Smith would later describe as the happiest and most productive period of his life.

As Professor of Moral Philosophy at Glasgow from 1752 to 1764, Smith taught courses covering natural theology, ethics, jurisprudence, and political economy.[^34] During this period, he developed the ideas that would form the basis of his first major work. In April 1759, Smith published *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, based on lectures he had delivered at Glasgow following his appointment in 1752.[^35][^36] The book was published in London by A. Millar (in the Strand) and A. Kincaid and J. Bell (in Edinburgh) with a recorded print run of 1,000 copies.[^37]

*The Theory of Moral Sentiments* provided the ethical, philosophical, economic, and methodological underpinnings for Smith's later works, including *The Wealth of Nations*.[^38] The book introduced Smith's concept of the "impartial spectator"—an imaginary witness representing our own conscience that guides our actions and encourages us to adopt morally acceptable behavior.[^39][^40] Smith argued that sympathy (the ability to imagine ourselves in another's situation) was central to moral judgment and social connection, and that moral approval arose when the "original passions of the person principally concerned are in perfect concord with the sympathetic emotions of the spectator."[^41][^42] The book's success established Smith's reputation as a leading moral philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment.

In 1764, Smith made an unexpected decision that would change the course of his life. He resigned his professorship at Glasgow to become the private tutor to Henry Scott, the young Duke of Buccleuch, who was about to embark on the customary Grand Tour of Europe.[^43][^44] The position was arranged by Charles Townshend, the Duke's stepfather and a leading British politician who greatly admired Smith's work.[^45] The tutoring position offered Smith a substantial salary and a generous pension for life, providing him with the financial security to pursue his scholarly work.[^46]

## Major Achievements

### The Grand Tour and European Intellectual Exchanges

Smith and the Duke of Buccleuch began their European tour in France in February 1764.[^47] They spent eighteen months in Toulouse, then the seat of a parlement, where they immersed themselves in the best society of the region before touring southern France and spending two months in Geneva.[^48] In Geneva, Smith met the famous philosopher François-Marie Arouet, better known as Voltaire.[^49] The tour then proceeded to Paris, where Smith was welcomed into French intellectual society and engaged with some of the most influential economic thinkers of the era.[^50]

In Paris, Smith met François Quesnay and Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, the leading figures of the Physiocrat movement—a school of political economy that emphasized agricultural production as the source of wealth and advocated for reduced government intervention in the economy.[^51] Smith was deeply interested in Physiocratic ideas, which would influence some aspects of his economic thinking, though he would ultimately develop his own distinct theoretical framework. Tragically, the Grand Tour was cut short in October 1766 when the Duke's younger brother fell ill and died in Paris.[^52] Smith and the Duke returned to Britain, but Smith retained his pension from the Duke for the rest of his life.

### The Wealth of Nations: Revolutionary Economic Thought

After returning from France, Smith spent the next decade working on his magnum opus, *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*. The book was published in two volumes on March 9, 1776—four months before the signing of the American Declaration of Independence—and became an instant success, selling out its first edition in only six months.[^53][^54][^55] *The Wealth of Nations* remains one of the most influential books in the history of economic thought and is often considered the foundational text of modern economics.[^56]

The book opened with Smith's famous description of a pin factory, illustrating the concept of division of labor. Smith explained how breaking down pin-making into approximately eighteen distinct specialized tasks could allow ten workers to produce 48,000 pins per day (an average of 4,800 pins per worker), whereas if each worker attempted to make entire pins independently, they might produce no more than twenty pins per day, or perhaps even just one.[^57][^58][^59] Though Smith's example was based on second-hand reporting from Diderot's *Encyclopédie* (1755) rather than direct observation, it powerfully demonstrated how specialization and division of labor could dramatically increase productivity.[^60][^61]

Smith's accounts of division of labor, free trade, self-interest in exchange, the limits on government intervention, price mechanisms, and the general structure of markets signified the moment when economics transitioned to the "modern."[^62] George Stigler attributed to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics"—that under competition, owners of resources will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium.[^63] Smith argued that the wealth of a nation was not measured by accumulated gold or bullion (as mercantilists believed) but by the value created and flowing through society—a concept now central to economic thought but revolutionary in Smith's time.[^64]

### The Invisible Hand and Market Mechanisms

Perhaps no concept from Smith's work has been more influential—and more frequently misinterpreted—than the "invisible hand." Surprisingly, Smith used this metaphor only once in *The Wealth of Nations*, in a passage describing how individuals pursuing their own economic gain are "led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention"—namely, the public good.[^65][^66] Smith wrote: "By directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."[^67]

The invisible hand concept gained widespread prominence in modern economics largely through Paul Samuelson's Economics textbook in 1948, which popularized the term and gave it new meaning.[^68] Modern interpretations often treat the invisible hand as a generalizable rule about the benefits of free markets, though scholars note this represents a significant departure from Smith's original, more limited usage.[^69][^70] Smith invoked the phrase to illustrate how public benefits may arise from individual actions not intended to produce such goods, rather than suggesting any "mystical force" guiding markets to equilibrium.[^71]

### Critique of Mercantilism and Advocacy for Free Trade

A central achievement of *The Wealth of Nations* was Smith's devastating critique of mercantilism, the dominant economic doctrine of his era. Mercantilism held that national wealth consisted of accumulated gold and bullion, that nations should maximize exports while minimizing imports, and that government should heavily regulate trade through tariffs, monopolies, and protectionist policies.[^72] Adam Smith and David Hume are considered the founding fathers of anti-mercantilist thought.[^73]

Smith firmly rejected the mercantilist idea that national wealth could be measured by the accumulation of precious metals, noting that "bullion was just the same as any other commodity, and that there was no reason to give it special treatment."[^74][^75] He argued that trade restrictions, tariffs, and protectionist measures only hampered the wealth of nations by preventing consumers from accessing cheaper goods and encouraging domestic industries to produce at higher costs.[^76] Smith's main concern was the excessive power of merchants and manufacturers who used their influence over government to secure monopolistic advantages.[^77]

Smith laid the groundwork for free trade by emphasizing the benefits of specialization and competition.[^78] His theory of absolute advantage demonstrated that if a country was more efficient at producing a good than another country, it should specialize in that good and trade with others for the rest of its needs.[^79] While mercantilists believed each country should hoard gold and seek hegemony, Smith argued that free trade eventually makes all parties better off—the foundation of the modern free trade argument.[^80] (It should be noted that the theory of comparative advantage was later developed by David Ricardo in 1817, building on but refining Smith's ideas.)[^81][^82]

### Commissioner of Customs and Later Years

In 1778, Smith was appointed Commissioner of Customs in Scotland, a position he would hold until his death.[^83] The appointment was due in part to the efforts of the Duke of Buccleuch and brought Smith an income of £600 annually, in addition to his £300 pension from the Duke.[^84] Smith moved to Edinburgh to live in Panmure House with his mother and cousin, Janet Douglas.[^85] Although Smith spoke of the duties as "easy and honourable," records show he attended meetings over 180 days per year, demonstrating his conscientious approach to the position.[^86]

Ironically, in this role Smith helped enforce laws against smuggling, even though in *The Wealth of Nations* he had defended smuggling as a legitimate activity in the face of "unnatural" legislation.[^87] Smith became a well-known figure in Edinburgh society, welcoming leading members of the Scottish literati to Panmure House for lively debates, and he was a founding member of the famous Oyster Club.[^88]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Views on Slavery: Moral Opposition and Economic Arguments

Smith's position on slavery represents both a commendable moral stance for his era and reveals the limitations of even progressive thinkers in the 18th century. Smith found slavery morally abhorrent, arguing it robbed enslaved persons of their liberty and slaveholders of their humanity, and he believed it was economically inefficient and detrimental to society's prosperity.[^89] He argued that free labor was economically superior to slave labor because free workers would be motivated to maximize output since they shared in the benefits of that output.[^90]

However, Smith demonstrated deep pessimism about slavery's abolition, believing that even robust economic arguments would prove insufficient to persuade slaveholders to free their enslaved workers. He argued that slaveholders' economic self-interests would be trumped by their "interest in power and domination," and that "the pride of man makes him love to domineer."[^91][^92] Smith noted this "taste for domination" underlined people's preference for slave over free labor, despite slavery's economic inefficiency.[^93] Thus, despite his personal abhorrence of slavery and his moral and economic arguments for its abandonment, Smith was very pessimistic that slavery would be abolished anytime soon, or indeed ever.[^94]

### Colonialism and Indigenous Peoples

Smith's writings on colonialism reveal significant tensions in his thinking. He condemned slavery, colonialism, taxation without representation, and criticized three pillars of British society—the mercantile system, universities, and the Church.[^95] His view of Atlantic empires was hardly positive; he described the first acts of European injustice in the New World as the "conquest," "plundering," and "cruel destruction" of the "harmless natives," followed by the injustice of colonial slavery.[^96] Smith insisted the basis of slavery and European colonialism in general was "fortune" (luck) rather than any innate superiority of European civilization.[^97]

However, Smith's account also contained deeply problematic passages that reveal the colonial attitudes of his era. In discussing new colonies, Smith wrote that "the colony of a civilized nation which takes possession of a waste country, or of one so thinly inhabited that the natives easily give place to the new settlers, advances more rapidly to wealth and greatness than any other human society."[^98] This passage demonstrates acceptance of settler colonialism's logic that characterized Indigenous lands as "waste" and assumed Indigenous peoples would "easily give place" to European settlers—assumptions that justified dispossession and genocide. These tensions in Smith's thinking about colonialism have become subjects of critical scholarly analysis.[^99]

### Misappropriation by Neoliberalism and Free-Market Fundamentalism

One of the most significant controversies surrounding Smith concerns not his own views but how they have been misrepresented and misappropriated by later advocates of unregulated capitalism. Neoliberals frequently invoke Smith's name as an early champion of private capitalism, with organizations like the Adam Smith Institute officially rebranding as "neoliberal" in 2016 while promoting market-led reforms.[^100][^101] However, scholars note striking differences between Smith's subtle, skeptical view of markets in a free society and recent caricatures of him as a free-market fundamentalist.[^102]

When *The Wealth of Nations* is read alongside *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, it becomes clear that the neoliberal appeal to Adam Smith was misguided, as Smith has been co-opted by neoliberal thinking to advance ideas contrary to those he favored.[^103][^104] Smith was very far from asking society to put faith in "entrepreneurs" or supposed "wealth-creators" whom neoliberalism views as drivers of prosperity—Smith believed giving entrepreneurs free reign would be like "putting the foxes in charge of the chicken coop."[^105] To Smith, markets were above all social constructs depending on rules, enforcement, and interventions by the state—truly "free" markets were a myth, and private enterprise often ended up as crony capitalism, a "conspiracy against the public."[^106]

Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz has noted that theories explain why unfettered markets often not only fail to lead to social justice but do not even produce efficient outcomes, and "there has been no intellectual challenge to the refutation of Adam Smith's invisible hand."[^107] Critics point out that without regulation, markets can lead to significant inequalities, environmental degradation, erosion of social welfare, and domination by monopolies and oligopolies.[^108][^109]

### Marxist Critiques and Class Analysis

Karl Marx and later Marxist scholars developed extensive criticisms of Smith's economic theories, though Marx acknowledged Smith as a foundational thinker and was, in many methodological and theoretical dimensions, a "Smithian."[^110] Both Smith and Marx recognized the central role of labor in wealth production, though they diverged sharply in their interpretations.[^111] Smith saw labor as the source of a nation's wealth and emphasized the benefits of division of labor in increasing productivity, while Marx also viewed labor as the source of all value but focused on how labor was exploited under capitalism.[^112]

Where Smith saw the maximizing of self-interest resulting in equilibrium, Marx saw exploitation—a situation where individuals do not receive benefits to meet their needs.[^113] Marx objected to the free market system and its inherent self-interest and competition, reasoning such a system would lead to inherent class struggle, inequality, and exploitation of workers by capitalists.[^114] Marx believed capitalism provided advantages to the already wealthy (the Bourgeoisie) who owned the means of production, while poorer members of society (the Proletariat) were forced to sell their labor to the owning class.[^115][^116] Marx argued these class positions were essentially fixed, and only a proletarian revolution could change the social order.[^117]

Marx strongly adhered to the idea that capitalism leads to greed and inequality, arguing that competition inherently involves greed, causing instability and injustice.[^118][^119] Even when trying to learn economics from classical masters like Smith, Marx approached their work "with unshakeable preconceptions," seeking to show that categories of value, price, capital, labor, profit, and property used by classical economists revealed capitalism as a system that grew only by expropriating economic value created by the working class.[^120][^121]

## Personal Life

Adam Smith never married and seems to have maintained an exceptionally close relationship with his mother, with whom he lived after his return from France.[^122] His mother died in 1784, six years before Smith's own death, and her loss affected him deeply.[^123] According to Dugald Stewart, Smith's first biographer, in the early part of Smith's life he was attached to "a young lady of great beauty and accomplishment," but after this disappointment, he laid aside all thoughts of marriage.[^124] Almost nothing else is known about Smith's romantic life, and he had no romantic relationships that historians have been able to document.[^125]

The most significant personal relationship in Smith's adult life was his friendship with David Hume (1711-1776), the renowned Scottish philosopher and historian. Smith and Hume were best friends for most of their adult lives, sharing what has been called "the greatest of all philosophical friendships."[^126][^127] Their friendship lasted from their first meeting around 1749 until Hume's death in 1776.[^128] The two men referred to each other as "My Dearest Friend," an epithet they uniquely reserved for each other.[^129] They were close friends for more than twenty-five years, and their friendship was a source of intellectual and emotional strength to both.[^130]

Though Hume was slightly older than Smith, Hume's writings were a strong early influence on Smith, and the friendship influenced Smith's work much more than Hume's.[^131] Almost everything Smith wrote shows unmistakable signs of Hume's influence.[^132] When Hume died in August 1776—just months after the publication of *The Wealth of Nations*—Smith was deeply affected. He wrote a moving tribute to Hume, describing him as approaching "as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit," a statement that provoked controversy given Hume's well-known religious skepticism.[^133]

Smith was known for his absent-mindedness and peculiar habits. Stories circulated about him wandering the streets of Edinburgh in his dressing gown, lost in thought, or talking to himself animatedly while walking.[^134] He was described as having a large nose, bulging eyes, a protruding lower lip, and a nervous twitch.[^135] Despite these eccentricities, Smith was a respected and beloved figure in Edinburgh society, known for his kindness, integrity, and stimulating conversation.[^136] He welcomed leading members of the Scottish literati to his home at Panmure House for intellectual discussions and was a founding member of the Oyster Club, a dining society that brought together Edinburgh's intellectual elite.[^137]

In his final years, Smith worked on revising his major works for new editions. He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on July 17, 1790, after a painful illness, likely stomach cancer.[^138] Shortly before his death, he requested that his unpublished manuscripts be burned, with the exception of some specific essays he wanted preserved.[^139] His body was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard in Edinburgh, where his grave can still be visited today.[^140]

## Legacy

### Father of Modern Economics

Adam Smith is hailed globally as the founder of modern economics, though this description is both overly simplistic and potentially misleading given the complexity and breadth of his thought.[^141][^142] Very few individual books have had as much impact as *An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations*, which remains a cornerstone of economic theory even today.[^143] His accounts of division of labor, free trade, self-interest in exchange, the limits on government intervention, price mechanisms, and market structure all signify the moment when economics transitioned to "the modern."[^144]

Smith argued that the wealth of a nation was derived not from hoarded gold but from how value is created and flows through society—this concept of economic flow is now central to economic thought, but Smith was the first to recognize its importance.[^145] George Stigler attributed to Smith "the most important substantive proposition in all of economics"—that under competition, owners of resources will use them most profitably, resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium.[^146] Smith coined the concept of the "invisible hand" of the market, an idea that remains highly influential in modern capitalism today.[^147]

The system of mercantilism gave way to one based on Smith's ideas as the Industrial Revolution progressed, paving the way for much of our present-day understanding of capitalism.[^148] The Great Enrichment that has grown global living standards by approximately thirty-fold since about 1800 owes much to Smith's brand of liberalism.[^149] Smith's work has influenced key thinkers across the contemporary political spectrum, from Karl Marx to Edmund Burke, from John Maynard Keynes to Milton Friedman.[^150][^151]

### Broader Intellectual Contributions

Smith's importance extends far beyond economics. His significance as a moral philosopher is now far better understood through recent study of *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, and his works on the nature of justice, science, and the expressive arts are recognized as major contributions to Enlightenment thought.[^152] *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* explored how people connect and build society beyond economic transactions, based on mutual empathy and respect—Smith understood that prosperity results from mutual empathy and respect, not merely from market exchanges.[^153]

Scholars have emphasized Smith's standing as a moral philosopher—one who was prepared to critique markets as well as to praise them.[^154] Recent scholarship has revealed broader dimensions of his work beyond economics, including contributions to political theory, rhetoric, jurisprudence, and the philosophy of science.[^155] Thirty-two Smith scholars from philosophy, economics, history, political science, English, and law have contributed "insightful and accessible chapters exploring Smith's social vision and its relevance in various contexts over time."[^156]

### Enduring Global Relevance

Smith's work is described as "as relevant today as it was in the eighteenth century."[^157] Chinese premier Wen Jiabao's scholarly interest in Smith's works demonstrates the global impact and enduring relevance of his ideas.[^158] Kenneth Boulding argued that "the evolutionary potential of Smith's ideas has yet to be exhausted."[^159] An interdisciplinary group of Smith scholars has challenged clichés about his work, showing "just how inspiring and fruitful an engagement with the great Scot continues to be."[^160]

Smith's insights into human behavior, markets, and free trade principles "remain relevant today, offering timeless wisdom in an ever-evolving economic landscape."[^161] His ideas continue to shape policy debates on trade, regulation, taxation, education, and the proper role of government in the economy. Universities around the world—from the Adam Smith Business School at the University of Glasgow to countless economics departments globally—continue to study and debate his contributions.[^162]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Contemporary scholars from diverse disciplines praise Smith's enduring contributions to human knowledge. Ryan Hanley brought together "some of the world's finest scholars from across a variety of disciplines to offer new perspectives on Smith's life, thought, and enduring legacy."[^163] These scholars emphasize the sophistication and continuing relevance of Smith's thinking across multiple domains.

Economists celebrate Smith's revolutionary insights into how markets function and how division of labor increases productivity. His recognition that specialization and exchange could dramatically increase prosperity laid the foundation for understanding economic growth and development.[^164] Political economists appreciate Smith's nuanced understanding that markets are social constructs requiring institutions, rules, and governance—not natural phenomena that function best without any oversight.[^165]

Moral philosophers recognize Smith's profound contributions to understanding human sympathy, moral judgment, and social connection. His concept of the impartial spectator provides a framework for understanding how moral norms develop and how individuals navigate between self-interest and concern for others.[^166] Scholars note that reading *The Theory of Moral Sentiments* alongside *The Wealth of Nations* reveals a thinker deeply concerned with virtue, justice, and human flourishing, not merely with economic efficiency.[^167]

Historians of ideas celebrate Smith as a central figure of the Scottish Enlightenment, whose work synthesized insights from moral philosophy, political economy, jurisprudence, and rhetoric into a comprehensive social science.[^168] His influence on subsequent thinkers—from Hume and Burke to Mill and Keynes—demonstrates the fertility of his ideas.[^169] An interdisciplinary group of Smith scholars has shown "just how inspiring and fruitful an engagement with the great Scot continues to be," challenging simplistic interpretations and revealing new dimensions of his thought.[^170]

### Negative Views

Critics from various perspectives have identified significant limitations and problems in Smith's work and legacy. Marxist scholars argue that Smith's framework obscures the exploitative nature of capitalist production, presenting what is actually class domination as mutually beneficial exchange.[^171] They contend that Smith's emphasis on self-interest and market mechanisms ignores how capitalism systematically advantages those who already own productive resources while forcing workers to sell their labor under conditions not of their choosing.[^172]

Contemporary critics note that Smith's optimism about markets failed to adequately account for monopoly power, information asymmetries, externalities, and collective action problems—all of which can cause markets to produce inefficient and unjust outcomes.[^173] Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz observed that "there has been no intellectual challenge to the refutation of Adam Smith's invisible hand," noting that modern economic theory has demonstrated numerous circumstances where unfettered markets fail to produce either efficiency or justice.[^174]

Scholars critical of colonialism and racism point to deeply problematic passages in Smith's work that, despite his criticisms of European colonial violence, ultimately accepted the logic of settler colonialism by characterizing Indigenous lands as "waste" and assuming Indigenous peoples would naturally make way for "civilized" European settlers.[^175] These passages reveal how even intellectually progressive figures of the Enlightenment were limited by the prejudices of their era.

Neoliberalism's appropriation of Smith has generated criticism both of Smith himself and of how his ideas have been deployed. Some critics argue Smith bears responsibility for legitimizing capitalism and market society, even if he did not anticipate all their consequences.[^176] Others argue that Smith has been fundamentally misrepresented by neoliberals who invoke his name to justify policies—such as opposition to all regulation, minimal taxation, and unrestricted corporate power—that Smith himself would likely have opposed.[^177][^178] As one scholar noted, what emerges most strikingly are "the differences between Smith's subtle, skeptical view of the role of markets in a free society, and recent caricatures of him as a free-market fundamentalist."[^179]

Feminist scholars have noted that Smith's framework largely ignored unpaid domestic labor, care work, and reproductive labor—dimensions of economic life essential to sustaining market society but invisible in his analysis.[^180] Environmental critics observe that Smith's growth-oriented framework provided no account of ecological limits or the environmental consequences of industrialization and expanding production.[^181]
