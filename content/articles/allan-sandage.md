## Summary

Allan Sandage was an American astronomer who spent decades measuring the expansion rate of the universe (Hubble constant). As Edwin Hubble's protégé, he continued the work of determining distances to galaxies and refining cosmological parameters. He identified the first quasar and made fundamental contributions to understanding stellar evolution and galaxy formation. Sandage is considered one of the most influential observational cosmologists.
