## Summary

Cornelis Drebbel built the first navigable submarine in 1620, a wooden vessel covered in greased leather that was rowed beneath the Thames River. He also invented an early thermostat, improved microscope and telescope lenses, and developed a scarlet dye. His submarine demonstrations for King James I were a sensation of early modern engineering.
