## Summary

Rutherford Birchard Hayes (1822-1893) served as the 19th President of the United States from 1877 to 1881, following the most disputed presidential election in American history[^1]. A Union Army veteran who rose to the rank of brevet major general during the Civil War, Hayes is most remembered for ending Reconstruction by withdrawing federal troops from the South[^2]. His presidency was marked by modest civil service reforms, efforts to restore faith in the executive office, and the controversial Compromise of 1877 that secured his election but abandoned African American civil rights in the South[^3]. Despite being derided as "His Fraudulency" by critics, Hayes served honorably, keeping his pledge to serve only one term and advocating for civil service reform and education[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Rutherford Birchard Hayes was born on October 4, 1822, in Delaware, Ohio, to Rutherford Ezekiel Hayes Jr. and Sophia Birchard Hayes[^5]. Tragedy struck the Hayes family even before Rutherford's birth—his father died in July 1822, just ten weeks before the future president entered the world[^6]. This early loss profoundly shaped Hayes's childhood, as did another family tragedy when his nine-year-old brother drowned while ice-skating when Rutherford was only two years old[^7].

Hayes remained physically frail throughout his childhood, requiring careful attention from his devoted mother Sophia. She took an active role in his early education, teaching him to read and write at home[^8]. His sister Fanny, described as exceptionally bright, introduced young Rutherford to the works of Shakespeare and the poetry of Sir Walter Scott, fostering an early love of literature and learning[^9].

The void left by his father's death was filled by his uncle, Sardis Birchard, a successful merchant in Lower Sandusky, Ohio. Sardis prospered in business and served as a surrogate father throughout Hayes's life, providing both financial support and guidance[^10]. This relationship would prove crucial to Hayes's educational opportunities and future success.

Hayes's formal education began at common schools in Delaware, Ohio. In 1836, he enrolled at the Norwalk Seminary in Norwalk, Ohio, before transferring to the Webb School, a preparatory school in Middletown, Connecticut[^11]. At Webb, he studied Latin and Ancient Greek, building the classical foundation expected of educated gentlemen of his era.

In 1838, Hayes entered Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where he flourished both academically and socially. He became successful in his studies, joined several student societies, and developed an interest in Whig politics—the beginning of his lifelong engagement with public affairs[^12]. In 1842, he graduated at the top of his class as valedictorian, a testament to his intellectual abilities and dedication[^13].

## Rise to Power

After graduating from Kenyon College, Hayes pursued a legal career, initially studying in a law office in Columbus for what he described as ten "vexatious and tedious" months[^14]. Unsatisfied with this apprenticeship approach, he entered Harvard Law School, where he earned a bachelor of laws degree in 1845[^15]. This Harvard education distinguished him among Ohio lawyers and opened doors that might otherwise have remained closed.

Hayes joined the Ohio bar in 1845 and opened his first practice in his uncle Sardis's town of Lower Sandusky[^16]. However, the small-town practice offered limited opportunities, and in 1850, he relocated to Cincinnati, Ohio's largest city, where he opened a law office with John W. Herron. He later formed partnerships with William K. Rogers and Richard M. Corwine[^17].

In Cincinnati, Hayes established himself primarily as a criminal defense attorney, but his most notable work involved defending freedom seekers—formerly enslaved people who had escaped across the Ohio River from Kentucky[^18]. Beginning in 1853, Hayes took on these controversial cases, demonstrating the abolitionist convictions that would define his political career. His 1855 defense of Rosetta Armstead became his most memorable case, showcasing his commitment to the antislavery cause[^19].

Hayes's political career began in 1858 when he was elected Cincinnati's city solicitor, a position he held until 1861[^20]. This role gave him valuable administrative experience and raised his public profile. His legal work defending refugee slaves also earned him respect among Ohio's antislavery Republicans, positioning him as a principled figure in state politics.

When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Hayes left his budding political career to join the Union Army[^21]. This decision would prove transformative for his political future. He was commissioned and served with distinction throughout the conflict, earning a reputation for exceptional bravery in combat. Hayes was wounded five times during the war, most seriously at the Battle of South Mountain in 1862[^22]. His courage and leadership led to his promotion through the ranks, ultimately achieving the rank of brevet major general[^23].

While still serving in the military in 1864, Hayes was nominated for Congress. When urged to return home to campaign, he famously refused, stating that an officer fit for duty who would abandon his post to electioneer should be scalped[^24]. This principled stance only enhanced his reputation, and he won the election anyway. Hayes served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1865 to 1867[^25].

His congressional service was followed by election as Governor of Ohio, where he served two consecutive terms from 1868 to 1872. After a brief retirement, he was elected to a third term beginning in 1876[^26]. As governor, Hayes championed education reform, prison reform, and civil service improvements, building a record as a progressive reformer that would carry him to the presidency.

## Major Achievements

### Civil War Service and Military Leadership

Hayes's most distinguished achievements came during his Civil War service. His exceptional bravery and tactical competence earned him respect from both superiors and subordinates. Wounded five times in combat, with his most serious injury occurring at the Battle of South Mountain in 1862, Hayes demonstrated personal courage that became legendary[^27]. His rise from volunteer officer to brevet major general reflected genuine merit in an era when political appointments were common in the Union Army[^28].

### Gubernatorial Reforms in Ohio

As Governor of Ohio across three terms (1868-1872, 1876-1877), Hayes implemented significant progressive reforms. He championed educational improvements, advocating for better funding and access to public schools[^29]. He also pushed for prison reform and more humane treatment of criminals, reflecting his belief that "one of the tests of the civilization of people is the treatment of its criminals"[^30]. These gubernatorial achievements established his reputation as a capable executive and progressive reformer.

### Restoring Faith in the Presidency

Perhaps Hayes's most significant presidential achievement was restoring popular faith in the office of the presidency itself. The office had deteriorated significantly after Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865, with subsequent presidents failing to command public respect or wield effective executive power[^31]. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom argues that Hayes's greatest achievement was reversing this deterioration and re-establishing the presidency as a respected institution[^32].

Hayes accomplished this through personal integrity and principled leadership. He refused to appoint relatives to government posts and did not seek to profit personally from his political positions[^33]. In an era of rampant corruption, Hayes's honesty stood out. He was described as "a paragon of honesty" who challenged patronage-hungry Republican politicians[^34].

### Civil Service Reform Initiatives

Hayes made civil service reform a centerpiece of his presidency, though he faced intense opposition from Congress and his own party. In his public letter accepting the Republican nomination, he vowed to support civil service reform and pledged to serve only one term, freeing himself from reelection pressures[^35].

On June 22, 1877, Hayes issued an executive order prohibiting political assessments—the practice of requiring federal employees to contribute to political campaigns—and forbidding civil servants from managing political parties, conventions, and campaigns[^36]. In 1878, he issued another executive order mandating competitive examinations for certain federal positions, laying the groundwork for merit-based hiring[^37].

Hayes believed firmly in meritocracy—the principle that positions, especially in government, should be earned based on merit rather than political connections[^38]. He wanted to abolish the spoils system entirely, though Congress, particularly Democrats who dominated the legislature, refused to cooperate. Undeterred, Hayes fired officials who refused to accept his executive orders, including future President Chester A. Arthur[^39].

While Hayes failed to enact comprehensive long-term reform during his presidency, his efforts generated crucial public support. The experiment with the New York customhouse proved the feasibility of merit-based civil service and made possible the passage of the landmark 1883 Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, which institutionalized competitive examinations and merit-based hiring[^40].

### Maintaining Peaceful Resolution of Electoral Crisis

Hayes's role in peacefully resolving the electoral crisis of 1876-1877 represents both an achievement and a controversy. The election between Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden was the most disputed in American history. Tilden received 184 uncontested electoral votes to Hayes's 165, with 185 needed to win[^41]. Four states—Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Oregon—returned disputed slates of electors totaling 20 electoral votes, and Hayes needed all 20 to win[^42].

Congress created a 15-member Electoral Commission through legislation passed January 29, 1877, consisting of five senators, five representatives, and five Supreme Court justices[^43]. Through a series of 8-7 votes along partisan lines, the commission awarded all disputed votes to Hayes, giving him a 185-184 electoral victory[^44].

Despite widespread outrage and Democratic cries of fraud, Hayes's willingness to work with Democrats and his reputation for personal integrity helped avoid potential political violence. The peaceful transfer of power, though controversial, demonstrated the resilience of American democratic institutions[^45].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### "His Fraudulency" and the Disputed Election

Hayes's presidency was forever tainted by the circumstances of his election. Outraged Northern Democrats derided him as "His Fraudulency," refusing to accept the legitimacy of his Electoral Commission victory[^46]. The nickname stuck, undermining his authority from the start. Critics argued that the Compromise of 1877—a speculated unwritten deal to resolve the electoral crisis—amounted to a corrupt bargain that traded the presidency for the abandonment of African American civil rights[^47].

While most historians now agree there is no written evidence that such a formal deal existed[^48], the perception of illegitimacy damaged Hayes's presidency. He governed under a cloud of suspicion, with opponents questioning his every decision and supporters defending what many saw as an indefensible electoral process.

### Ending Reconstruction and Abandoning African Americans

Hayes's most damning controversy was his role in ending Reconstruction, the post-Civil War federal effort to protect African American civil and political rights in the South. On April 24, 1877, on orders from President Hayes, federal troops withdrew from the Louisiana state house—the last federally defended state house in the South—just 12 years after the Civil War's end[^49].

This withdrawal effectively ended Reconstruction and federal protection for Black voting rights[^50]. Southern Democrats had promised to protect African Americans' civil and political rights as part of the compromise, but these promises were not kept[^51]. The end of federal interference in Southern affairs led to widespread disenfranchisement of Black voters through violence, intimidation, and later, Jim Crow laws[^52].

Historians have long blamed Hayes for abandoning African Americans and enabling the rise of systematic racial oppression. His decision to withdraw troops opened the door to decades of segregation, disenfranchisement, and racial violence. While some scholars argue that Reconstruction was already failing when Hayes took office and that he had limited options[^53], the fact remains that his actions marked the federal government's retreat from protecting Black civil rights for nearly a century.

### The Great Strike of 1877

Hayes faced severe criticism for his handling of the Great Strike of 1877, the first major railroad strike in American history. When railroad workers struck to protest wage cuts, violence erupted in multiple cities. Hayes responded by deploying federal troops to break the strike, siding decisively with railroad owners and against workers[^54]. Critics condemned this use of federal power to suppress labor organizing, arguing that Hayes was protecting corporate interests at workers' expense.

This incident reinforced perceptions that Hayes, despite his reformist rhetoric, ultimately served wealthy elites rather than ordinary Americans. His famous quote—"This is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people no longer. It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations"[^55]—ironically captured the very criticism leveled against his own administration's labor policies.

### Native American Assimilation Policy

Hayes pursued a Native American policy aimed at forced assimilation, believing that Indigenous peoples should abandon their cultures and adopt European-American ways of life[^56]. This approach, though considered progressive by some contemporaries who saw it as an alternative to extermination, represented cultural genocide. Hayes supported policies that undermined tribal sovereignty, promoted individual land ownership over communal systems, and encouraged the destruction of Native languages and traditions.

### Chinese Exclusion Treaty

Hayes's administration negotiated a treaty with China that paved the way for Chinese exclusion legislation, restricting Chinese immigration to the United States[^57]. While Hayes himself vetoed the most extreme anti-Chinese legislation passed by Congress, his administration's treaty negotiations enabled future discriminatory laws. This represents a significant failure in his record on civil rights and equality.

### Inconsistent Civil Service Reform

Even Hayes's signature achievement—civil service reform—faced criticism for inconsistency. While he championed merit-based appointments and fought patronage, he was unable to fully implement his vision due to congressional opposition[^58]. Critics argued that his reforms were half-measures that failed to fundamentally transform the spoils system. His firing of Chester A. Arthur, while principled, also demonstrated the limits of executive power in the face of entrenched political machines.

## Personal Life

Rutherford Hayes married Lucy Webb on December 30, 1852, in a simple ceremony in Cincinnati[^59]. They had first met on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware two years earlier[^60]. Their marriage proved to be one of deep affection and mutual respect, lasting until Lucy's death in 1889.

Lucy Webb Hayes was a remarkable woman in her own right. Born in Chillicothe, Ohio, on August 28, 1831, to Dr. James Webb and Maria Cook, Lucy experienced early tragedy when her father died during a cholera epidemic in Kentucky in 1833, where he had gone to free slaves he had inherited[^61]. This antislavery legacy influenced Lucy's strong abolitionist convictions.

Lucy transferred to Cincinnati Wesleyan Female College and graduated in 1850, making her the first college-educated First Lady[^62]. Despite this distinction, she was not entirely comfortable at state dinners and formal social occasions[^63]. A devout Methodist and teetotaler, Lucy influenced her husband's views on temperance and slavery, though Hayes never formally joined her church[^64].

The Hayeses had eight children together: Birchard Austin (1853-1926), Webb Cook (1856-1934), Rutherford Platt (1858-1927), Joseph Thompson (1861-1863), George Crook (1864-1866), Fanny, Scott Russell (born 1871), and Manning Force Hayes (1873-1874)[^65]. Tragically, three children died young. Their infant son Joe died while the family was at an Army camp during the Civil War, and their nearly two-year-old son George also died during this period[^66]. Manning Force Hayes died as an infant in 1874.

Despite these losses, the Hayes White House was described as lively and informal, reflecting Lucy's spirited personality[^67]. A superb contralto who accompanied herself on guitar, Lucy filled the executive mansion with music[^68]. Their two youngest children, Fanny and Scott, distributed presents to White House employees during holidays, and the residence was often so full of guests that one of their older sons, returning home from college, reportedly had to sleep in a bathtub[^69].

The Hayeses celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary on December 30, 1877, in the White House, surrounded by relatives, close friends, and staff, repeating their marriage vows[^70]. Lucy suffered a stroke and died on June 25, 1889, at age 57, devastating Hayes[^71]. He never fully recovered from her loss and died himself just over three years later.

Hayes died on January 17, 1893, at his home in Fremont, Ohio (formerly Lower Sandusky), at age 70, from complications of a heart attack[^72]. In 1915, his remains were moved to his former home at Spiegel Grove for burial with Lucy[^73].

Hayes was known for his personal integrity, honesty, and devotion to public service. He was a man of deep convictions, shaped by his Methodist upbringing and his experiences defending fugitive slaves as a young lawyer. His diary and letters reveal a thoughtful, introspective person who struggled with the moral complexities of his era while maintaining firm principles.

## Legacy

Rutherford B. Hayes's legacy is deeply complex and contested. His reputation has fluctuated dramatically over time, reflecting changing historical perspectives on Reconstruction, civil rights, and presidential leadership.

### Changing Historical Assessments

From approximately 1900 until the 1950s, Hayes was praised as the statesman who reunited the nation and ended what was then characterized as the "awful period" of Reconstruction[^74]. He was hailed as the "statesman of reunion," and white Americans across regions celebrated his withdrawal of federal troops from the South as wise statesmanship. In the first survey of historians rating presidents, conducted in 1948, Hayes ranked 13th out of 29 presidents—a respectable middle position[^75].

However, Hayes's reputation declined sharply as historical perspectives on Reconstruction shifted during the Civil Rights era. As scholars recognized Reconstruction as a noble, if incomplete, effort to establish racial equality, Hayes's role in ending it appeared far less admirable. Modern historians increasingly viewed his withdrawal of troops as a betrayal of African Americans and a capitulation to white supremacy. His ranking in presidential surveys fell accordingly, with Hayes now generally rated as below-average or mediocre.

### Civil Service Reform Foundation

Despite controversies surrounding Reconstruction, Hayes's contributions to civil service reform represent a lasting positive legacy. Although he failed to achieve comprehensive reform during his presidency, his executive orders and persistent advocacy generated crucial public support for merit-based government employment[^76]. The 1883 Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act, passed two years after Hayes left office, built directly on his groundwork and fundamentally transformed American government administration[^77].

Hayes demonstrated that merit-based appointments were feasible and effective, particularly through his experiment with the New York customhouse. His willingness to confront powerful political machines, including firing future President Chester A. Arthur for refusing to implement reforms, showed courage and principle that inspired future reformers.

### Restoration of Presidential Authority

Biographer Ari Hoogenboom argues persuasively that Hayes's greatest achievement was restoring popular faith in the presidency and reversing the deterioration of executive power following Lincoln's assassination[^78]. Through personal integrity, principled leadership, and refusal to profit from office, Hayes re-established the presidency as a respected institution worthy of public trust. This restoration provided a foundation for stronger executive leadership in subsequent administrations.

### The Reconstruction Debate

Hayes's role in ending Reconstruction remains his most controversial legacy. For decades, he was blamed as the individual primarily responsible for abandoning African Americans and enabling Jim Crow segregation[^79]. However, recent scholarship has provided a more nuanced assessment.

Many modern Reconstruction experts argue that Hayes inherited an already failing Reconstruction policy and had limited options when taking office[^80]. Most federal troops had already been withdrawn from the South during the Grant administration, and Republican governments in Southern states were collapsing[^81]. Hayes's real choice was not whether but when to withdraw the remaining troops[^82].

Furthermore, while the Compromise of 1877 is often cited as a corrupt bargain, most historians now believe there was no formal deal[^83]. The connection between Hayes's election and Reconstruction's end, while temporal, may not have been directly causal.

That said, Hayes must still bear responsibility for the consequences of his actions. While he may not have single-handedly ushered in the Jim Crow era—those laws became widespread only in the 1890s and were legitimized by the Supreme Court in 1896, three years after Hayes's death[^84]—his withdrawal of federal protection enabled the disenfranchisement and oppression that followed.

### A Progressive Vision Unfulfilled

Recent biographers, particularly Ari Hoogenboom, present Hayes as a more progressive and far-sighted leader than previously recognized. Far from being a Southern sympathizer or exemplar of Gilded Age greed, Hayes was a devout, pragmatic champion of equal rights who faced impossible circumstances[^85]. His policies and politics were ultimately insufficient to prevent the coming of racial and economic inequality in late 19th-century America, but he deserves more consideration than simply being dismissed as another dismal Gilded Age president[^86].

Hayes's advocacy for universal education as the foundation for universal suffrage, his progressive views on criminal justice reform, and his honest administration all suggest a leader ahead of his time in some respects, even as he failed catastrophically in protecting African American rights.

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Hayes emphasize his personal integrity, courage, and progressive instincts in an era of rampant corruption and political cynicism. Biographer Ari Hoogenboom has written extensively about Hayes as a misunderstood president whose achievements have been unfairly dismissed by historians measuring him against later ideals[^87].

Hoogenboom and other sympathetic scholars argue that Hayes faced severely limited options regarding Reconstruction. By 1877, Reconstruction was already collapsing, with most federal troops withdrawn and Northern public opinion turning against continued intervention in the South[^88]. Hayes's decision to complete the withdrawal reflected political realities rather than personal preference or moral failing. These historians contend that scholars have not adequately understood his constraints nor interpreted his actions fully or fairly[^89].

Hayes's supporters emphasize his genuine commitment to civil service reform and his willingness to challenge powerful political machines, including members of his own party. His executive orders prohibiting political assessments and requiring competitive examinations represented real progress, even if comprehensive reform eluded him due to congressional opposition[^90]. The passage of the Pendleton Act in 1883 vindicated his approach and demonstrated the lasting impact of his advocacy.

Hoogenboom portrays Hayes as neither a Southern sympathizer nor an exemplar of Gilded Age greed, but rather as a devout, pragmatic champion of equal rights who governed according to progressive principles despite facing overwhelming obstacles[^91]. His defense of fugitive slaves as a young lawyer, his brave Union Army service, and his consistent advocacy for African American education all demonstrate genuine commitment to racial equality, even if his presidential policies failed to protect Black civil rights effectively.

Defenders also point to Hayes's restoration of faith in the presidency as a crucial achievement. His personal honesty, refusal to profit from office, and principled leadership provided a stark contrast to the corruption that characterized the Grant administration and much of the Gilded Age. By demonstrating that presidents could govern ethically, Hayes helped preserve public trust in democratic institutions during a critical period.

Some scholars argue that Hayes deserves credit for maintaining peace during the unprecedented electoral crisis of 1876-1877. His willingness to work with Democrats and his reputation for integrity helped avoid potential political violence and preserved the constitutional order, even if the process that elevated him to the presidency was deeply flawed.

### Negative Views

Critics of Hayes focus relentlessly on his abandonment of African Americans and the catastrophic consequences of ending Reconstruction. Regardless of the constraints he faced, these historians argue, Hayes made choices that enabled decades of systematic racial oppression, violence, and disenfranchisement. The fact that he inherited a difficult situation does not absolve him of responsibility for his decisions and their devastating impact on millions of Black Americans.

Historians critical of Hayes emphasize that he betrayed the principles he had fought for during the Civil War. As a Union officer wounded five times in combat and a lawyer who defended fugitive slaves, Hayes understood the stakes of racial equality. Yet as president, he prioritized sectional reconciliation between white Northerners and white Southerners over justice for African Americans. This represents a profound moral failure that no amount of context can excuse.

Critics also point to the broken promises that accompanied Hayes's policies. Southern Democrats pledged to protect Black civil and political rights in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops, but these promises were never kept[^92]. Hayes either naively believed these assurances or cynically accepted them knowing they would be violated. Either way, he bears responsibility for the resulting disenfranchisement and oppression.

Scholars critical of Hayes's labor policies emphasize his use of federal troops to break the Great Strike of 1877, arguing that he sided decisively with corporate interests against workers[^93]. This action contradicted his rhetoric about government serving the people rather than corporations and revealed the limits of his progressive vision.

Hayes's Native American assimilation policies are condemned as cultural genocide by modern scholars. While he may have believed that assimilation represented a humane alternative to extermination, the policy aimed at destroying Indigenous cultures, languages, and ways of life. This represents a significant moral failing in his record.

Critics also note the inconsistency between Hayes's civil service reform rhetoric and his limited achievements. While he issued executive orders and spoke eloquently about merit-based appointments, he failed to build sufficient political support for comprehensive reform. His reforms were incremental at best and easily reversible, leaving the spoils system largely intact.

The circumstances of Hayes's election continue to draw criticism. Whether or not a formal Compromise of 1877 existed, Hayes accepted the presidency knowing that the Electoral Commission process was deeply flawed and that many Americans, including most Democrats, viewed his victory as illegitimate. His willingness to govern under such circumstances reveals an ambition that contradicted his professed principles.

Finally, critics argue that Hayes's single term demonstrated his limited political skills and inability to build coalitions necessary for transformative leadership. His conflicts with Congress left him largely ineffective, unable to advance his stated priorities or prevent the rollback of civil rights protections. A more skilled politician might have found ways to protect African Americans while navigating the political constraints of the era.
