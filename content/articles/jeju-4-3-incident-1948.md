## Summary

The **Jeju 4.3 Incident** refers to a series of armed uprisings, military suppression, and massacres that occurred on Jeju Island, South Korea, between **April 3, 1948, and May 1954**. Following Korea's liberation from Japan, ideological conflict over the division of the peninsula exploded on the island. The South Korean government, backed by the **U.S. Military Government**, labeled the islanders "reds" and launched a scorched-earth campaign. Tens of thousands of civilians, including women, children, and the elderly, were slaughtered in the name of anti-communism.

## The Buildup

### March 1st Shooting (1947)
Tensions began on **March 1, 1947**. During a rally celebrating the independence movement, a police horse trampled a young child. The crowd threw stones, and the police opened fire, killing six civilians.
*   **General Strike:** Outraged, 95% of the island's workforce, including police officers and government employees, went on a general strike.
*   **Red Island:** The U.S. military government (USAMGIK) interpreted the strike not as a protest against police brutality, but as a communist plot. They replaced local police with mainlanders and members of the **Northwest Youth Association**, a violently anti-communist paramilitary group known for extortion, rape, and torture.

### The Uprising (April 3, 1948)
On April 3, 1948, the **South Korean Labor Party** (SKLP) on Jeju launched an armed uprising.
*   **Reason:** To oppose the May 10th general election, which was limited to South Korea and would solidify the national division.
*   **Target:** They attacked police stations and Northwest Youth Association quarters.

## The "Scorched Earth" Slaughter

Following the establishment of the Republic of Korea under **Syngman Rhee** in August 1948, the government decided on "total suppression."

### Martial Law and Order No. 9
In November 1948, martial law was declared. **Order No. 9** stated that anyone found more than 5km from the coastline (the mid-mountain regions) would be considered a rebel and shot.
*   **Village Burnings:** Operation forces burned down 70% of the island's villages, mostly in the mountainous interior.
*   **Cave Massacres:** Civilians fled to natural lava tube caves (like Daranshi Cave) to hide. Soldiers discovered these caves and threw grenades in or suffocated the occupants with smoke. In 1991, the remains of 11 people (including a child) were found in Daranshi Cave, perfectly preserved.

### Bukchon-ri Massacre
On January 17, 1949, in one of the worst single incidents, soldiers surrounded the village of **Bukchon-ri**. They gathered nearly 1,000 residents in a schoolyard, separated military and police families, and then took the rest to nearby fields and shot them. Over 300 to 400 people died in a single day. The "Om Pang Field" remains a memorial site today.

## U.S. Responsibility

The massacre occurred under the operational command of the U.S. military.
*   **USAMGIK:** Until August 1948, the U.S. was the legal government.
*   **KMAG:** After August, the **Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG)** retained operational control. Brigadier General **William L. Roberts** praised the brutal suppression tactics. U.S. planes were used for reconnaissance to spot refugees hiding in the mountains. The U.S. viewed Jeju as a test case for containing communism in Asia.

## Aftermath and Legacy

### Decades of Silence
Under the authoritarian regimes of Rhee, Park Chung-hee, and Chun Doo-hwan, mentioning 4.3 was a crime.
*   **Guilt by Association:** Family members of victims were blacklisted (`Yeonjwaje`), barred from civil service, military promotion, or travel.
*   **"Sun-i Sam-ch'on":** In 1978, author **Hyun Ki-young** published *Sun-i Sam-ch'on*, a novel depicting the massacre. He was arrested and tortured by the KCIA throughout the suppression era.

### Truth and Reconciliation
It was only after democratization that the truth emerged.
*   **2003:** President **Roh Moo-hyun** officially apologized to the people of Jeju.
*   **2006:** A government report confirmed state responsibility.
*   **2048:** The goal is for full healing, but the U.S. government has yet to issue an official apology for its role.
