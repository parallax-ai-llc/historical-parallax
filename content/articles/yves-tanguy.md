## Summary

Yves Tanguy was a French Surrealist painter known for his vast, dreamlike landscapes populated by abstract biomorphic forms. Largely self-taught, he was inspired to paint after seeing a work by Giorgio de Chirico. His meticulously rendered impossible worlds influenced science fiction art and later abstract painters.
