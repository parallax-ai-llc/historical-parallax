## Summary

Ibn Arabi (1165-1240), known as "al-Shaykh al-Akbar" (the Greatest Master), was one of the most influential Islamic mystics, philosophers, and theologians in history. Born in Murcia, Andalusia (present-day Spain), he produced over 850 works covering Islamic jurisprudence, theology, philosophy, and mystical spirituality. His magnum opus, "al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya" (The Meccan Revelations), spans thousands of pages and represents one of the most comprehensive expositions of Islamic mysticism ever written. His doctrine of "wahdat al-wujud" (the Unity of Being) profoundly influenced Sufi thought across the Islamic world while simultaneously generating fierce controversy that persists to the present day.

## Early Life and Background

Ibn Arabi was born on the 27th of Ramadan in 560 AH (July 28, 1165 CE) in Murcia, a prosperous city in the southeastern region of al-Andalus under the Almohad dynasty.[^1] His full name was Abu 'Abd Allah Muhammad ibn 'Ali ibn Muhammad ibn al-'Arabi al-Hatimi al-Ta'i, tracing his lineage to the noble Arab tribe of Tayy.[^2] His family belonged to the educated administrative class, with his father serving as a high-ranking official in the court of the Almohad sultan.[^3]

The young Ibn Arabi grew up during a golden age of Islamic civilization in Spain, where Muslim, Christian, and Jewish scholars engaged in vibrant intellectual exchange.[^4] He received a traditional Islamic education in Seville, where his family moved when he was eight years old, studying the Quran, hadith (prophetic traditions), Islamic jurisprudence, and Arabic literature.[^5] His early teachers included prominent scholars of the Zahiri and Maliki schools of Islamic law.[^6]

According to his own accounts, Ibn Arabi experienced a profound spiritual awakening in his teenage years that redirected his life toward mysticism.[^7] He described visions and mystical experiences that began when he was approximately fifteen years old, which he interpreted as divine callings to pursue the spiritual path.[^8] These experiences led him to seek out Sufi masters throughout al-Andalus and North Africa, including the renowned female mystic Fatima bint al-Muthanna of Cordoba, who reportedly recognized his spiritual potential.[^9]

During his formative years, Ibn Arabi also encountered the famous philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes) in Cordoba. This meeting, which Ibn Arabi later recounted, symbolized the intersection between rational philosophy and mystical spirituality that would characterize his mature thought.[^10] By his late twenties, Ibn Arabi had already gained recognition as both a scholar and mystic, attracting his own circle of disciples.[^11]

## Rise to Prominence

Ibn Arabi's rise to prominence as a spiritual authority began during his extensive travels throughout the Islamic world, which commenced around 1200 when he was in his mid-thirties.[^12] He left al-Andalus, never to return, embarking on what would become a thirty-year journey across North Africa, Egypt, Arabia, Anatolia, and the Levant.[^13] This peripatetic period proved crucial in establishing his reputation and developing his philosophical-mystical system.

In 1201, Ibn Arabi performed the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, an experience that profoundly shaped his spiritual worldview.[^14] During his stay in the holy city, he met a young Persian woman named Nizam, whose beauty and spiritual refinement inspired his famous collection of mystical love poetry, "Tarjuman al-Ashwaq" (The Interpreter of Desires).[^15] The work's explicit romantic imagery scandalized some readers, prompting Ibn Arabi to write a commentary explaining the poems' esoteric spiritual symbolism.[^16]

In Mecca, Ibn Arabi also began writing his monumental "al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya" (The Meccan Revelations), which would occupy him for thirty years and ultimately comprise 560 chapters covering virtually every aspect of Islamic knowledge and spiritual practice.[^17] He claimed that the book's structure and content were revealed to him in visions, describing himself as merely a scribe recording divine inspiration.[^18]

Ibn Arabi's travels brought him into contact with rulers, scholars, and Sufi masters across the Islamic world. In Cairo, he engaged with Egyptian scholars and Sufi circles.[^19] In Konya (Anatolia), he met the young Rumi's father, Baha al-Din Walad, a renowned scholar and mystic.[^20] In Baghdad, Damascus, and Aleppo, he found patronage among local elites who recognized his extraordinary learning.[^21]

His reputation grew not only through personal encounters but also through the circulation of his writings. Unlike many Sufi masters who transmitted teachings primarily through oral instruction, Ibn Arabi was extraordinarily prolific, producing treatises on topics ranging from technical points of Islamic law to elaborate cosmological theories.[^22] His "Fusus al-Hikam" (The Bezels of Wisdom), written near the end of his life, became one of the most studied and controversial texts in Islamic intellectual history.[^23]

By the time Ibn Arabi settled permanently in Damascus in 1223, he was already recognized as one of the preeminent spiritual authorities of his age.[^24] He established a teaching circle at the Umayyad Mosque and attracted students from across the Islamic world.[^25] The Ayyubid rulers of Damascus, who valued scholarship and Sufism, provided him with patronage and respect.[^26]

## Major Achievements

Ibn Arabi's most significant achievement was the creation of a comprehensive metaphysical and cosmological system that integrated Islamic theology, philosophy, and mysticism into an unprecedented synthesis.[^27] His doctrine of "wahdat al-wujud" (Unity of Being or Oneness of Existence) represents the pinnacle of this intellectual edifice, proposing that all existence is essentially one reality that manifests in diverse forms.[^28] While he never used this exact phrase, later interpreters distilled this concept from his writings, particularly from "Fusus al-Hikam" and "al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya."[^29]

The sheer volume and scope of his literary output constitutes another remarkable achievement. Modern scholars attribute over 850 works to Ibn Arabi, though only a fraction survive.[^30] His magnum opus, "al-Futuhat al-Makkiyya," runs to approximately 10,000 pages in modern editions and encompasses discussions of Islamic law, theology, cosmology, psychology, ethics, and spiritual practice.[^31] This encyclopedic work demonstrates his mastery of virtually all branches of Islamic knowledge, from technical jurisprudence to esoteric symbolism.

"Fusus al-Hikam" (The Bezels of Wisdom), written in Damascus in 1229, distills Ibn Arabi's mature metaphysical thought into twenty-seven chapters, each dedicated to a prophet and exploring the particular divine wisdom manifested through that prophet's life and message.[^32] The work's dense symbolic language and profound philosophical content have generated hundreds of commentaries over the centuries.[^33] Ibn Arabi claimed he received the book's content directly from the Prophet Muhammad in a vision, lending it special authority in Sufi circles.[^34]

Ibn Arabi made pioneering contributions to the development of Arabic literary arts, particularly in his use of symbolism and his integration of poetry with philosophical and mystical discourse.[^35] His "Tarjuman al-Ashwaq" demonstrates extraordinary poetic skill while encoding complex spiritual teachings in the language of romantic love.[^36] His innovative use of metaphor, allegory, and symbolic imagery influenced subsequent generations of Islamic poets and writers.[^37]

In the field of Islamic jurisprudence, despite being primarily known as a mystic, Ibn Arabi demonstrated formidable expertise. He wrote extensively on legal matters, producing works on Maliki, Shafi'i, and Zahiri jurisprudence.[^38] His legal writings reveal a sophisticated understanding of Islamic law's foundations and methodologies, and he advocated for a form of independent legal reasoning (ijtihad) informed by spiritual insight.[^39]

Ibn Arabi's cosmological theories elaborated a complex hierarchy of existence, describing the relationship between the Divine Reality and the created universe through concepts such as the "Perfect Human" (al-insan al-kamil), the "Muhammadan Reality" (al-haqiqa al-Muhammadiyya), and the "Divine Names and Attributes."[^40] These concepts became fundamental to later Sufi metaphysics and inspired centuries of commentary and elaboration.[^41]

His teachings on spiritual psychology and the path of mystical realization provided detailed maps of the soul's journey toward divine knowledge.[^42] He described multiple levels of spiritual stations, states, and experiences with unprecedented precision, drawing on his own mystical experiences and those reported by earlier Sufis.[^43] This systematic approach to spirituality influenced the development of organized Sufi orders and their training methods.[^44]

Ibn Arabi also made significant contributions to Islamic eschatology and the interpretation of dreams and visions. His works contain extensive discussions of the afterlife, resurrection, divine judgment, and the hierarchies of paradise and hell, presented with imaginative detail informed by both revelation and spiritual unveiling.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Ibn Arabi's teachings have provoked intense controversy from his lifetime to the present day, making him one of the most polarizing figures in Islamic intellectual history.[^46] The primary source of contention has been his doctrine of wahdat al-wujud (Unity of Being), which critics have condemned as heretical pantheism that erases the fundamental distinction between Creator and creation.[^47]

During his lifetime, Ibn Arabi faced accusations of unbelief (kufr) from conservative scholars, particularly those adhering to strict literalist interpretations of Islamic texts.[^48] The Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya (1263-1328), one of the most influential critics, launched sustained attacks on Ibn Arabi's metaphysics, declaring him and his followers to be outside the bounds of Islam.[^49] Ibn Taymiyya argued that Ibn Arabi's teachings contradicted fundamental Islamic principles, including God's transcendence and the absolute distinction between God and His creation.[^50]

The controversy intensified with accusations that Ibn Arabi's writings contained explicit claims of divinity or suggested that everything in existence, including evil and idolatry, was essentially divine.[^51] Critics pointed to passages in "Fusus al-Hikam" where Ibn Arabi appeared to justify Pharaoh's claim to divinity and to suggest that idol-worshippers were, in reality, worshipping the true God.[^52] Such passages scandalized orthodox scholars and provided ammunition for those seeking to condemn him as a heretic.[^53]

Ibn Arabi's claims to receive direct divine inspiration and revelation also drew criticism. His assertion that "Fusus al-Hikam" was dictated to him by the Prophet Muhammad in a vision raised questions about the finality of prophetic revelation and the authority of his teachings.[^54] Critics argued that such claims elevated his personal experiences to a level approaching or even superseding the authority of established Islamic sources.[^55]

His legal opinions sometimes contradicted mainstream scholarly consensus, further alienating conservative jurists. His advocacy for independent legal reasoning and his willingness to draw on mystical insight in deriving legal rulings challenged established methodologies.[^56] Some scholars viewed this as dangerous innovation that undermined the authority of traditional Islamic jurisprudence.[^57]

The explicit erotic imagery in "Tarjuman al-Ashwaq," even after Ibn Arabi provided spiritual interpretations, troubled some readers who questioned whether such language was appropriate for discussing divine matters.[^58] Critics suggested that the poems revealed inappropriate spiritual attitudes or served as a convenient cover for genuinely romantic, rather than mystical, sentiments.[^59]

Ibn Arabi's teachings on religious pluralism and the validity of different prophetic traditions have also generated controversy. His suggestion that all authentic religious paths ultimately lead to the same divine reality, and his respectful treatment of pre-Islamic prophets and religions, struck some Muslims as undermining Islam's exclusive claims to truth.[^60] In "Fusus al-Hikam," his discussions of figures like Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus presented them as embodiments of particular divine wisdoms, suggesting a kind of theological equivalence that troubled orthodox thinkers.[^61]

Modern Salafi scholars have continued Ibn Taymiyya's critique, condemning Ibn Arabi's influence on Sufism and calling for his works to be banned.[^62] In some contemporary Muslim societies, his writings remain controversial or officially proscribed.[^63] Yet despite—or perhaps because of—these controversies, Ibn Arabi's works continue to be widely read, studied, and debated across the Islamic world.[^64]

---

## Personal Life

Despite his prolific writings, Ibn Arabi revealed relatively little about his intimate personal life, maintaining focus on spiritual matters rather than biographical details.[^65] He married at least twice, and scholars have identified references to wives in his writings, though specific information about these relationships remains sparse.[^66] His first marriage likely occurred during his years in al-Andalus before his departure around 1200.[^67]

In Damascus, Ibn Arabi married the daughter of a prominent scholar, and this relationship appears to have provided him with domestic stability during his final years.[^68] He had at least one son, Sadr al-Din Muhammad, who became a scholar and preserved some of his father's works, and a daughter.[^69] However, Ibn Arabi's writings suggest that his biological family remained secondary to his spiritual family—his disciples and fellow seekers on the mystical path.[^70]

Contemporary accounts describe Ibn Arabi as possessing a dignified bearing and penetrating spiritual presence that impressed those who met him.[^71] He reportedly lived simply, despite the patronage he received from wealthy supporters, maintaining the austere lifestyle characteristic of Sufi practitioners.[^72] His daily routine included regular worship, meditation, teaching, and writing, often continuing his literary work late into the night.[^73]

Ibn Arabi's personality, as reflected in his writings and the accounts of his disciples, combined intellectual brilliance with profound spiritual sensitivity.[^74] He demonstrated remarkable confidence in his mystical experiences and divine inspiration, sometimes expressing this confidence in ways that struck contemporaries as arrogant or presumptuous.[^75] Yet he also showed humility before the divine mystery, repeatedly emphasizing the limitations of human understanding and the inadequacy of language to express ultimate realities.[^76]

His relationships with his teachers and spiritual guides reveal a deeply respectful and devoted character. He spoke reverently of his early Sufi mentors, particularly the female mystics who guided his spiritual development.[^77] Throughout his life, he maintained correspondence with scholars and spiritual friends across the Islamic world, demonstrating both intellectual generosity and personal warmth.[^78]

Ibn Arabi's writings reveal a man of intense spiritual experiences, including visions, dreams, and mystical states that he described in detail.[^79] He claimed to have conversed with prophets, angels, and departed saints in visionary encounters that shaped his teachings.[^80] These experiences formed the foundation of his authority as a spiritual master, yet they also contributed to the controversies surrounding him.[^81]

In his final years in Damascus, Ibn Arabi lived in a house near the Salihiyya quarter on Mount Qasiyun, where he taught, wrote, and received visitors until his death.[^82] He died on November 10, 1240 (28 Rabi' al-Thani 638 AH) at the age of seventy-five.[^83] According to contemporary reports, his funeral was attended by large crowds, including scholars, Sufis, and common people, testifying to his reputation and influence.[^84]

## Legacy

Ibn Arabi's legacy represents one of the most profound and enduring influences on Islamic spirituality, philosophy, and culture.[^85] His metaphysical system became the dominant framework for Sufi thought across the Islamic world, from Morocco to Indonesia, shaping the worldview of millions of Muslims over seven centuries.[^86] Major Sufi orders, including the Shadhiliyya, Naqshbandiyya, and Mevlevi, incorporated his teachings into their doctrines and practices.[^87]

The tradition of commentary on Ibn Arabi's works constitutes a vast literary corpus in its own right. "Fusus al-Hikam" alone has generated more than one hundred major commentaries in Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and other Islamic languages.[^88] Distinguished scholars like Abd al-Razzaq al-Qashani, Sadr al-Din al-Qunawi (Ibn Arabi's stepson and foremost disciple), Dawud al-Qaysari, and Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi devoted their intellectual careers to explicating and defending his teachings.[^89]

Ibn Arabi's influence extended beyond specifically Sufi circles to impact Islamic philosophy, theology, and even jurisprudence. His sophisticated integration of philosophical concepts with mystical experience provided a model for later thinkers attempting to reconcile reason and revelation.[^90] Islamic philosophers in Iran, the Ottoman Empire, and Mughal India engaged extensively with his ideas, even when they disagreed with his conclusions.[^91]

In literature and the arts, Ibn Arabi's symbolic universe and poetic imagery inspired countless poets, writers, and artists. Persian poets like Rumi, Jami, and Hafiz, though developing their own distinctive voices, operated within a cultural and intellectual context profoundly shaped by Ibn Arabi's vision.[^92] Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, and Malay literatures all bear the marks of his influence.[^93]

His tomb in Damascus became a major pilgrimage site, visited by scholars, mystics, and ordinary Muslims seeking blessings and spiritual inspiration.[^94] The Ottoman sultan Selim I renovated the tomb complex in the sixteenth century, constructing a beautiful mausoleum that still stands today.[^95] For centuries, Damascus served as a center for the study of Ibn Arabi's works, with scholarly families specializing in transmitting and interpreting his teachings.[^96]

In the modern era, Ibn Arabi's works have attracted international scholarly attention. The Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi Society, founded in 1977, has promoted research and translation of his writings, making them accessible to Western audiences.[^97] Contemporary scholars like Henry Corbin, Toshihiko Izutsu, William Chittick, Michel Chodkiewicz, and Claude Addas have produced groundbreaking studies of his thought.[^98]

Ibn Arabi's teachings on religious pluralism and the unity of mystical experience have resonated with modern seekers interested in comparative spirituality and interfaith dialogue.[^99] His sophisticated articulation of the relationship between unity and multiplicity, transcendence and immanence, has attracted philosophers and theologians beyond the Islamic tradition.[^100]

However, his legacy remains contested in the contemporary Muslim world. While traditional Sufi communities continue to revere him as the greatest of Islamic mystics, Salafi and Wahhabi movements have intensified their opposition to his teachings.[^101] In 2010, attempts by conservative clerics in Damascus to demolish his tomb shrine sparked international protest and highlighted the ongoing polarization his legacy generates.[^102]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers and defenders of Ibn Arabi, from his own time to the present, have celebrated him as "al-Shaykh al-Akbar" (the Greatest Master), whose genius penetrated to the deepest levels of spiritual reality.[^103] Traditional Sufi authorities regard him as the "Seal of Muhammadan Sainthood," a title indicating that he perfected and completed the science of Islamic mysticism just as Muhammad sealed prophetic revelation.[^104]

Scholarly defenders argue that accusations of pantheism fundamentally misunderstand Ibn Arabi's sophisticated metaphysics.[^105] Contemporary scholar William Chittick has demonstrated that Ibn Arabi maintained a clear ontological distinction between the Divine Essence and created beings, while asserting their existential unity in the sense that all existence derives from and depends upon the one Divine Reality.[^106] Far from crude pantheism, Ibn Arabi's doctrine represents a nuanced form of panentheism consistent with Islamic monotheism.[^107]

Admirers emphasize Ibn Arabi's extraordinary synthesis of Islamic sciences, which demonstrated that mystical experience and rigorous scholarship need not conflict.[^108] His mastery of Quranic exegesis, hadith, jurisprudence, theology, and philosophy, combined with profound spiritual realization, established him as a complete scholar-saint embodying the ideal unity of knowledge and spiritual practice.[^109]

Modern scholars have praised Ibn Arabi's psychological insights and his detailed phenomenology of mystical states and stations.[^110] His descriptions of spiritual psychology anticipate certain modern theories about consciousness, identity, and transformative experience.[^111] Psychologists and scholars of mysticism have found his writings valuable for understanding the phenomenology of mystical experience across religious traditions.[^112]

Ibn Arabi's literary and poetic achievements have earned recognition from scholars of Arabic and Persian literature. His innovative use of symbolic language, his integration of poetry and philosophy, and his influence on subsequent literary traditions mark him as a major figure in Islamic cultural history.[^113] Contemporary Arab and Iranian intellectuals have celebrated his artistic contributions alongside his spiritual teachings.[^114]

Defenders highlight his inclusive spiritual vision, which honored the wisdom in all authentic religious traditions while remaining firmly grounded in Islamic revelation.[^115] In an era of religious conflict and exclusivism, Ibn Arabi's recognition of diverse paths to the Divine offers a model for interfaith understanding and cooperation.[^116] Modern scholars like Sachiko Murata and William Chittick have shown how his framework provides resources for contemporary dialogue between religions.[^117]

Supporters also note that the most extreme statements attributed to Ibn Arabi often derive from misreadings or quotations taken out of context from his vast corpus.[^118] His defenders argue that understanding his thought requires engaging seriously with his entire system rather than selectively citing problematic passages.[^119] The Muhyiddin Ibn Arabi Society and contemporary scholars have worked to provide accurate editions and contextual interpretations of his works.[^120]

---

### Negative Views

Critics of Ibn Arabi, led historically by Ibn Taymiyya and continuing through contemporary Salafi scholars, have condemned his teachings as fundamentally incompatible with Islamic orthodoxy.[^121] They argue that his doctrine of wahdat al-wujud, regardless of how it is interpreted, dangerously blurs the absolute distinction between Creator and creation that lies at the heart of Islamic monotheism.[^122]

Ibn Taymiyya's influential critique, which has shaped opposition to Ibn Arabi for seven centuries, accused him of promoting existential monism that logically leads to the conclusion that God and the universe are identical.[^123] This, Ibn Taymiyya argued, contradicts fundamental Quranic teachings about God's transcendence, His absolute difference from created beings, and the reality of divine judgment and human accountability.[^124] If all existence is essentially one divine reality, critics contend, then the distinction between good and evil, belief and unbelief, becomes meaningless.[^125]

Conservative scholars have pointed to specific passages in "Fusus al-Hikam" as evidence of heretical beliefs. Ibn Arabi's discussion of Pharaoh's claim "I am your lord most high" as containing truth from a certain perspective, and his suggestion that idol-worshippers worship the true God unknowingly, have been particularly condemned.[^126] Critics argue that such statements relativize fundamental religious distinctions and undermine prophetic missions.[^127]

Modern Salafi scholars like Muhammad Nasir al-Din al-Albani and Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz issued formal legal opinions (fatwas) declaring Ibn Arabi's teachings heretical and warning Muslims against reading his works.[^128] These contemporary critics have intensified opposition to Sufism generally, viewing Ibn Arabi as the source of its most dangerous innovations.[^129]

Some academic critics, while not necessarily concerned with religious orthodoxy, have questioned the coherence and consistency of Ibn Arabi's metaphysical system. They point to apparent contradictions within his vast corpus and argue that his writings often sacrifice logical rigor for poetic mystification.[^130] Skeptics suggest that the obscurity of his expression sometimes reflects confused thinking rather than profound mystical insight.[^131]

Rationalist Muslim thinkers have criticized Ibn Arabi's reliance on visions, dreams, and direct mystical experience as sources of knowledge, arguing that this approach undermines the authority of reason and revelation.[^132] They contend that basing theological and metaphysical claims on subjective experiences opens the door to arbitrary and unverifiable assertions.[^133]

Feminist critics have noted that despite Ibn Arabi's reported respect for female spiritual teachers in his youth, his theoretical writings often reflect patriarchal assumptions about gender and spiritual capacity.[^134] His cosmological system assigns masculine and feminine qualities to different levels of reality in ways that some modern readers find problematic.[^135]

Historical critics have also questioned Ibn Arabi's claims to have received "Fusus al-Hikam" directly from the Prophet Muhammad in a vision. Skeptics argue that this claim represents either delusion or a rhetorical strategy to bolster the authority of his personal philosophical speculations.[^136] They contend that presenting individual theological innovations as divinely revealed teachings threatens the foundations of Islamic religious authority.[^137]
