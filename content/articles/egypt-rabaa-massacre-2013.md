## Summary

On August 14, 2013, Egyptian security forces did something that would have been unthinkable two years earlier: they surrounded a protest camp and opened fire on unarmed civilians for hours. By the time the smoke cleared at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo, at least 817 people were dead—and likely over 1,000. It was the largest mass killing of demonstrators in a single day in modern history.[^1]

The victims were supporters of Mohamed Morsi, Egypt's first democratically elected president, who had been removed by the military in a coup just weeks earlier. They had gathered in the tens of thousands, camping in the square for six weeks to demand his return. When the security forces came with bulldozers and armored vehicles, they came to kill. Snipers shot from rooftops. Protesters were gunned down as they ran. Bodies piled in makeshift morgues.[^2]

The Rabaa massacre marked the final death of the Arab Spring in Egypt. The generals who had deposed Morsi—led by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi—would face no consequences. The Muslim Brotherhood was banned, its members imprisoned by the thousands. And the world, which had once celebrated Tahrir Square, responded with muted concern and continued arms sales. Rabaa showed that some lives matter less than geopolitics.[^3]

## Aftermath

### Immediate

**State of emergency declared:**

- Churches and government buildings attacked (by some Morsi supporters)

**Crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood:**

- Declared terrorist organization (December 2013)

- Complete suppression[^10]

### Long-Term

**For Egypt:**

- Sisi became president (2014)
- Authoritarian rule consolidated

- Press freedom eliminated
- Arab Spring hopes extinguished

**For Morsi:**

- Imprisoned
- Multiple trials

### International Response

**Remarkably muted:**

- US suspended some military aid briefly
- Then resumed
- No sanctions on Sisi
- Egypt remained key ally
- Western governments prioritized "stability"

**Human Rights Watch:**

> "One of the world's largest killings of demonstrators in a single day in recent history... The security forces' actions likely amounted to crimes against humanity."

**No one was prosecuted.**[^11]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Immediate:**

- Military unwilling to tolerate prolonged protest
- Morsi supporters refused to disperse
- Mutual escalation

**Structural:**

- Deep state never accepted Morsi
- Military-civilian divide
- Islamist-secular polarization
- Counter-revolutionary sentiment

### Was It Planned?

**Evidence suggests:**

- Security forces prepared for mass casualties
- Hospitals cleared; morgues prepared
- Exit routes deliberately blocked
- Snipers pre-positioned

**This was not crowd control. It was elimination.**[^12]

### Comparison

| Massacre                | Deaths             | Accountability         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Rabaa (2013)            | 800-1,000+         | None                   |
| Tiananmen (1989)        | Hundreds-thousands | None (China)           |
| Bloody Sunday NI (1972) | 14                 | Inquiry 38 years later |

**Rabaa may be the largest single-day massacre of protesters in modern history.**

### The Rabaa Symbol

**Four-fingered salute:**

- R4bia (Arabic for "four" + abbreviation)
- Yellow hand with four fingers raised
- Used by Morsi supporters globally
- Symbol of resistance and memory
- Banned in Egypt[^13]

---

## Legacy

### For Egypt

- Rabaa anniversary marked clandestinely
- Open mourning dangerous
- Sisi regime remains in power
- Political opposition crushed
- Memory maintained in diaspora

### For the Arab Spring

- Showed limits of revolution
- Military power remained decisive
- Democratic transitions fragile
- Counter-revolution succeeded

### For International Justice

- Impunity for mass atrocity
- Geopolitics trumped accountability
- No ICC investigation (Egypt not a member)
- Human rights subordinated to "stability"[^14]
