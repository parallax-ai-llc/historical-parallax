## Summary

Kiyowara no Takehira (清原武衡, died November 14, 1087) was a prominent Japanese warrior and military commander of the Kiyohara clan during the late Heian period. A member of one of northern Japan's most powerful families, Takehira played a crucial role in the Later Three Years' War (Gosannen War, 1083-1087), ultimately meeting his demise during the siege of Kanazawa fortress. His defeat marked the end of Kiyohara dominance in the Tōhoku region and paved the way for the rise of the Northern Fujiwara dynasty. Takehira is also remembered in Japanese cultural history as the archetypal villain in the famous kabuki play "Shibaraku."[^1][^2][^3]

---

## Early Life and Background

The exact birth date of Kiyowara no Takehira remains unknown, as detailed records of his early life were not extensively preserved. Takehira was born into the Kiyohara clan (清原氏, Kiyohara-shi), a powerful warrior family that descended from Prince Toneri, son of Emperor Tenmu (631-686). This noble lineage gave the Kiyohara clan considerable prestige and legitimacy in governing the northern frontier provinces of Japan.[^4][^5]

The Kiyohara clan had established itself as the dominant power in Dewa Province (出羽国), located on the Sea of Japan side of northern Honshu, corresponding roughly to modern-day Yamagata and Akita prefectures. The position of Governor of Dewa province was passed down within the Kiyohara family across generations, making them hereditary military governors of this strategically important frontier region.[^6][^7]

During the 11th century, two powerful families controlled the far north of Japan: the Abe clan ruled Mutsu Province on the Pacific side, while the Dewa Kiyohara clan ruled Dewa Province on the Sea of Japan side. The Kiyohara family maintained control over their territories through a combination of official court appointments and military might, exemplifying the growing power of regional warrior families during the Heian period.[^8][^9]

Takehira grew up during a transformative period in Japanese history when warrior culture was evolving. The early warrior code called "kyūba no michi" (Way of the Bow and Horse) emphasized martial skills, particularly mounted archery, loyalty to one's lord, and personal honor. These values would have shaped Takehira's upbringing and military education.[^10][^11]

---

## Rise to Power

Kiyowara no Takehira's rise to prominence was closely tied to his family's critical role in the Former Nine Years' War (Zenkunen no Eki, 1051-1063), a major conflict that reshaped the power dynamics of northern Japan. During this war, the Kiyohara clan provided crucial military support to the Minamoto clan, led by Minamoto no Yoriyoshi, in their struggle against the rebellious Abe clan of Mutsu Province.[^12][^13]

The Kiyohara Governor of Dewa contributed substantial forces to the Minamoto effort, and their intervention proved decisive in achieving victory over the Abe clan in 1063. This military alliance demonstrated the Kiyohara clan's significant military capabilities and their willingness to support imperial authority when it aligned with their interests.[^14]

Following the defeat of the Abe clan, the Kiyohara clan reaped substantial rewards for their support. The family took over the administration of Mutsu Province in addition to their existing control of Dewa Province, effectively making them the dominant power across the entire Tōhoku region of northern Honshu. This expansion of territory and influence marked the zenith of Kiyohara power.[^15][^16]

After the Former Nine Years' War, Kiyowara no Takehira became involved in the complex family politics of the Kiyohara clan. He played a significant role in the upbringing of Fujiwara no Kiyohira (then known as Kiyohara no Kiyohira), who had been brought into the Kiyohara family following his biological father's death. The young Kiyohira's mother had become the concubine of a Kiyohara leader, and Kiyohira was raised alongside his stepbrother Sanehira and half-brother Iehira in this complex blended family.[^17][^18]

---

## Military Leadership and the Later Three Years' War

Within twenty years after the Former Nine Years' War, internal quarrels and conflicts arose within the Kiyohara family over differing interests arising from intermarriage with various warrior families. These tensions escalated into open warfare during the 1080s, initiating what became known as the Later Three Years' War (Gosannen no Eki, 1083-1087).[^19][^20]

Kiyowara no Takehira emerged as one of the principal military leaders during this conflict. He allied himself closely with his nephew (or possibly half-brother, according to some sources) Kiyohara no Iehira, who was the head of one branch of the family. Together, they represented a powerful faction within the increasingly fractured Kiyohara clan.[^21]

When Minamoto no Yoshiie was appointed Governor of Mutsu in 1083, he initially attempted to resolve the Kiyohara family conflict peacefully. However, his efforts at mediation failed, and he was soon forced to take sides and gather his own troops to restore order to the region. Yoshiie's intervention transformed what had been an internal family dispute into a broader regional war.[^22][^23]

Takehira demonstrated his military prowess by gathering his troops in Mutsu and crossing to Dewa to meet up with Iehira. According to historical records, Takehira told Iehira that driving away Governor Yoshiie brought them honor, indicating his defiant stance against what he likely viewed as external interference in Kiyohara family affairs.[^24]

The military strategy employed by Takehira and Iehira centered on fortifying strong defensive positions. They established their headquarters at the Kanazawa (also spelled Kanezawa) stockade, an impregnable fortress that they believed could withstand any assault. Takehira was reportedly delighted with their victory over Yoshiie in earlier skirmishes and confident in their position at the Kanazawa fortress.[^25][^26]

---

## The Siege of Kanazawa and Defeat

The final chapter of Kiyowara no Takehira's military career unfolded during the prolonged siege of Kanazawa fortress in 1087. Minamoto no Yoshiie, reinforced by his brother Minamoto no Yoshimitsu and critically supported by Fujiwara no Kiyohira (Takehira's former stepson who had switched allegiances), assembled a formidable force to confront the Kiyohara rebels.[^27][^28]

By September 1087, Yoshiie had advanced on the Kiyohara headquarters at Kanazawa Saku with approximately 20,000 troops. Rather than attempt direct assaults that had previously failed against the fortress's strong defenses, Yoshiie implemented a different strategy: a strict siege and blockade designed to starve out the defenders.[^29][^30]

Yoshiie's tactics during the campaign demonstrated sophisticated military thinking that drew upon classical Chinese military texts. In one famous incident, when a flock of birds settled in a certain spot and then abruptly flew off, Yoshiie suspected an ambush, had the place surrounded, and revealed the enemy army. This environmental observation technique, inspired by texts like The Art of War, showcased the level of strategic sophistication employed during the conflict.[^31]

The siege lasted from August to November 1087. Unable to break through the impregnable defenses through direct assault, Yoshiie's forces maintained their blockade, gradually depleting the supplies within the stockade. The starvation tactics proved devastatingly effective, and as winter approached and food supplies dwindled to nothing, the situation inside Kanazawa became desperate.[^32][^33]

On November 14, 1087, with their position untenable, Takehira and Iehira set fire to the stockade in a final desperate act and attempted to flee. However, both leaders were captured by Yoshiie's forces during their escape attempt. They were executed the same day, bringing the Later Three Years' War to a definitive conclusion.[^34][^35]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Kiyowara no Takehira's historical reputation has been significantly shaped by criticisms and negative portrayals, both from contemporary sources and later cultural interpretations. His role in the Later Three Years' War has been characterized as rebellion against legitimate authority, though this interpretation requires nuanced understanding of the complex political situation.[^36]

From the perspective of the imperial court and Minamoto supporters, Takehira's defiance of Governor Minamoto no Yoshiie represented insubordination against imperial authority. By refusing to submit to Yoshiie's attempts at conflict resolution and instead choosing armed resistance, Takehira positioned himself in opposition to the court-appointed governor, a stance that could be interpreted as rebellion.[^37]

The internal strife within the Kiyohara clan that Takehira helped perpetuate had devastating consequences for the stability of northern Japan. The Later Three Years' War caused significant suffering among the civilian population of the Tōhoku region, disrupting agriculture, trade, and daily life during the prolonged conflict. Critics could argue that Takehira's unwillingness to compromise or submit to mediation prolonged unnecessary bloodshed.[^38]

Perhaps most damaging to Takehira's reputation was his cultural portrayal in the famous kabuki play "Shibaraku" (Wait a Moment!). In this theatrical tradition, Kiyohara no Takehira appears as an archetypal villain, portrayed as a kugeaku (villainous nobleman) character scheming to succeed to the throne. The play depicts him capturing many good people who oppose him and ordering his retainers to kill those who will not obey his will.[^39][^40]

In kabuki performances, Takehira is painted with blue makeup to demonstrate that he is a villain, and his stomach is outlined in black lines to show his muscular appearance but also his brutishness. He wears a large black wig parted in the middle with a gold crown and is clad in all white, holding a fan and ledger as symbols of corrupt bureaucratic power. This theatrical characterization, while not historically accurate, has significantly influenced popular perceptions of Takehira as a tyrannical nobleman and oppressive authority figure.[^41][^42]

The betrayal by Fujiwara no Kiyohira, Takehira's former stepson who sided with Minamoto no Yoshiie, adds another controversial dimension to Takehira's story. Some historical interpretations suggest that Takehira's treatment of his adopted family members or his political decisions may have alienated key allies, contributing to his ultimate downfall.[^43]

---

## Personal Life

Details about Kiyowara no Takehira's personal life remain relatively sparse in historical records, as was common for military figures of the Heian period whose lives were primarily documented through their military and political activities. However, certain aspects of his family relationships and personal character can be gleaned from available sources.[^44]

Takehira was intricately connected to the complex web of family relationships within the Kiyohara clan. His relationship with Kiyohara no Iehira, described in various sources as either his nephew or half-brother, was particularly significant. The two formed a close military and political alliance during the Later Three Years' War, suggesting a strong personal bond beyond mere strategic convenience.[^45]

Perhaps the most complex personal relationship in Takehira's life involved Fujiwara no Kiyohira, who had been brought up within the Kiyohara household. Historical sources indicate that Takehira or another Kiyohara leader had taken Kiyohira's mother as a concubine after defeating and killing her first husband during the Former Nine Years' War. This arrangement brought the young Fujiwara no Kiyohira into the Kiyohara family, where he was raised alongside other Kiyohara children.[^46][^47]

The eventual betrayal by Fujiwara no Kiyohira, who sided with Minamoto no Yoshiie against his adoptive family, suggests complex dynamics within the household. Whether Takehira treated his stepson poorly or whether Kiyohira simply recognized the political winds shifting against the Kiyohara clan remains a matter of historical speculation.[^48]

Takehira's personality, as can be inferred from historical accounts, appears to have been characterized by martial pride and defiance. His reported statement to Iehira that "driving away Governor Yoshiie brought them honor" reveals a warrior mentality that valued military success and independence over political submission, even when confronted with superior forces representing imperial authority.[^49]

His confidence in the defensive capabilities of Kanazawa fortress and his willingness to endure a prolonged siege rather than surrender suggests either stubborn determination or perhaps an overestimation of his strategic position. This same confidence may have contributed to his ultimate defeat when Yoshiie's patient siege tactics gradually eroded the Kiyohara position.[^50]

## Legacy

The legacy of Kiyowara no Takehira is multifaceted, encompassing both his historical significance in the military and political transformation of Heian-period Japan and his enduring cultural representation in Japanese theater. His defeat in 1087 marked a crucial turning point in the history of northern Japan and contributed to fundamental shifts in the feudal power structure.[^51]

The immediate consequence of Takehira's defeat was the complete collapse of Kiyohara dominance in the Tōhoku region. The death of Takehira and Iehira at Kanazawa effectively dismantled Kiyohara authority in northern Dewa Province, creating a power vacuum that would be filled by the emerging Northern Fujiwara dynasty under Fujiwara no Kiyohira.[^52][^53]

Fujiwara no Kiyohira's rise to power following the defeat of his adoptive family represents one of the most significant aspects of Takehira's legacy. By inheriting domains formerly held by both the Abe and Kiyohara clans, Kiyohira established the Northern Fujiwara dynasty at Hiraizumi, which would endure until 1189. This regime became renowned for its cultural achievements and wealth, essentially replacing Kiyohara dominance with a new power structure that would last for nearly a century.[^54][^55]

The Later Three Years' War, in which Takehira played a central role, had profound implications for the development of Japanese feudalism. The conflict emphasized the rising importance of private armies and the samurai class, setting the stage for the decline of centralized imperial control. The war witnessed the solidification of hereditary retainer bands drawn from lower aristocratic strata, evolving into proto-samurai networks that prioritized martial loyalty over courtly refinement.[^56][^57]

Significantly, despite Minamoto no Yoshiie's military victory over Takehira and the Kiyohara forces, the imperial court in Kyoto refused to formally recognize the conflict as an official campaign. Instead, they classified it as a private feud and denied Yoshiie any state-sanctioned rewards or titles beyond his pre-existing governorship. This imperial response demonstrated the court's weakening control over regional military affairs and foreshadowed the eventual rise of warrior governments that would characterize later Japanese history.[^58]

In cultural memory, Takehira's most enduring legacy may be his role as the archetypal villain in the kabuki play "Shibaraku," one of the most famous and frequently performed pieces in the kabuki repertoire. This theatrical representation, while historically inaccurate, has ensured that Takehira's name remains known to Japanese audiences centuries after his death. The play, which features the dramatic aragoto (exaggerated heroic) acting style, uses Takehira as a symbol of corrupt authority overcome by heroic virtue.[^59][^60]

The siege of Kanazawa fortress, where Takehira made his final stand, became a landmark event in Japanese military history. The tactics employed by both sides—Takehira's reliance on fortification and Yoshiie's patient siege strategy—were studied by later military commanders and contributed to the evolving understanding of warfare in Japan.[^61]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some historical perspectives acknowledge Kiyowara no Takehira's role as a warrior defending his family's legitimate interests during a period of complex political transition. The Kiyohara clan had earned their position of power through loyal service to the Minamoto and the imperial court during the Former Nine Years' War, and Takehira could be seen as defending this hard-won status against external interference.[^62]

From this viewpoint, Takehira's resistance to Minamoto no Yoshiie's governorship might be interpreted not as simple rebellion but as a defense of regional autonomy against centralizing pressures. The Kiyohara family had effectively governed the Tōhoku region for decades, and Takehira's actions could be understood as an attempt to preserve this established order against what he may have perceived as unjustified interference in internal family matters.[^63]

Takehira's military capabilities and leadership should be acknowledged as significant achievements. His ability to fortify and defend the Kanazawa stockade against Minamoto forces for several months demonstrated considerable strategic and tactical skill. The fact that Yoshiie, one of the most celebrated warriors of the Heian period, required months of siege warfare and substantial reinforcements to overcome Takehira's position speaks to the defender's military competence.[^64]

The loyalty that Takehira inspired in his nephew Iehira and their allied forces reflects positively on his leadership qualities. Warriors of the period valued personal bonds and loyalty highly, and the willingness of Kiyohara forces to endure months of siege conditions suggests that Takehira commanded genuine respect and allegiance from his followers.[^65]

Some scholars note that the Later Three Years' War, despite its destructive nature, represented an important stage in the evolution of Japanese warrior culture and feudalism. Takehira's participation in this conflict contributed to the development of military tactics, warrior codes, and the samurai class that would come to define later Japanese history.[^66]

### Negative Views

The dominant historical assessment of Kiyowara no Takehira has been largely critical, viewing him as a rebellious figure whose actions destabilized the Tōhoku region and ultimately led to the destruction of his own family's power. Contemporary sources aligned with the Minamoto and imperial court portrayed him as an insubordinate provincial leader who defied legitimate authority.[^67]

Takehira's role in prolonging the internal conflict within the Kiyohara clan has been criticized as shortsighted and destructive. Rather than seeking compromise or accepting mediation from Governor Yoshiie, Takehira chose armed resistance, leading to years of warfare that devastated the northern provinces and ultimately resulted in the complete collapse of Kiyohara power.[^68]

The betrayal by Fujiwara no Kiyohira, his former stepson, suggests possible failures in Takehira's family leadership and political judgment. Kiyohira's decision to ally with Minamoto no Yoshiie against his adoptive family indicates that Takehira may have alienated important members of his household or failed to maintain the unity necessary for his faction's survival.[^69]

Critics point to Takehira's ultimate strategic failure at Kanazawa fortress. While his defensive fortifications were formidable, his apparent failure to anticipate or prepare for an extended siege left his forces vulnerable to starvation tactics. A more prudent commander might have either sought terms before the situation became desperate or ensured adequate provisions for a prolonged siege.[^70]

The cultural memory of Takehira as preserved in kabuki theater reflects enduring negative perceptions. His characterization as a villainous nobleman scheming for power, while dramatized and not entirely historical, draws upon genuine historical concerns about his opposition to legitimate authority and his role in regional instability.[^71][^72]

Historical sources sympathetic to the Northern Fujiwara dynasty, which succeeded the Kiyohara, naturally portrayed Takehira and the Kiyohara leadership in negative terms to legitimize the regime change. These accounts emphasize the disorder and conflict associated with Kiyohara rule and contrast it with the cultural achievements and stability of the subsequent Fujiwara period at Hiraizumi.[^73]
