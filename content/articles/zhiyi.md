## Summary

Zhiyi was a Chinese Buddhist monk who founded the Tiantai school of Buddhism, one of the first truly Chinese Buddhist schools. His system of classifying all Buddhist teachings into a comprehensive hierarchy, with the Lotus Sutra at the apex, was revolutionary. He developed the practice of 'cessation and contemplation' (zhiguan) meditation. His comprehensive philosophical system influenced all subsequent Chinese, Korean, and Japanese Buddhism.
