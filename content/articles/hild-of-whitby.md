## Summary

Hild (Hilda) of Whitby was an Anglo-Saxon abbess who founded the double monastery of Whitby (housing both monks and nuns) and was one of the most powerful women in early English Christianity. She hosted the famous Synod of Whitby in 664, which decided the date of Easter for the English Church. She trained five bishops and her monastery was a center of learning. The poet Caedmon, said to be the first English poet, was discovered under her care.
