## Summary

Rudolf Virchow was a German physician, pathologist, and anthropologist known as the father of modern pathology. He established that diseases arise at the cellular level with his concept 'omnis cellula e cellula' (every cell originates from another cell). He also founded the field of social medicine, arguing that social conditions are major determinants of health. Virchow was also an influential politician and public health reformer.
