## Summary

William Redington Hewlett was an American engineer and entrepreneur who co-founded Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) with David Packard in 1939, starting from a Palo Alto garage that became known as the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley."[^1] His invention of the resistance-capacitance audio oscillator launched HP's success and established the foundation for what would become the world's largest manufacturer of electronic instruments.[^2] Beyond his technical innovations, Hewlett pioneered progressive management practices known as "The HP Way," emphasizing employee respect, profit-sharing, and flexible work arrangements.[^3] His legacy extends through the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which he established in 1966 and became one of the world's wealthiest philanthropic organizations with over $13 billion in assets.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

William Redington Hewlett was born on May 20, 1913, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where his father, Albion Walter Hewlett, taught at the University of Michigan Medical School.[^5] In 1916, when Bill was just three years old, the family moved to San Francisco after his father accepted a similar position at Stanford Medical School.[^6] This relocation would prove fateful, connecting young Hewlett to the institution that would shape his future.

Tragedy struck when Hewlett was twelve years old—his father died suddenly, leaving a profound void in his life.[^7] He was enrolled in San Francisco's Lowell High School, where he attended and became the 1929-1930 Battalion Commander of the school's Army JROTC program.[^8] Despite his leadership abilities, Hewlett faced significant academic challenges. He had undiagnosed dyslexia that affected his writing skills and made written assignments difficult during his school years.[^9] Reading proved particularly challenging, and taking notes became an obstacle he had to overcome through sheer determination.

Rather than surrendering to these learning difficulties, Hewlett developed remarkable adaptive strategies. He trained himself to memorize everything in school, making a strength out of his weakness by learning to memorize lectures through logical ordering in his mind.[^10] He approached learning kinesthetically, disassembling common objects such as door locks and other mechanical devices and conducting chemistry experiments.[^11] While his high school years were not academically noteworthy—doubtless influenced by the then little-noticed and rarely-accommodated dyslexia—his intellectual curiosity and sterling character won his high school principal's admiration.[^12]

The principal encouraged Stanford to take a chance on young Bill, and despite his uneven academic record, he was admitted as a freshman in 1930.[^13] At Stanford, Hewlett found his calling. He received his bachelor's degree from Stanford in 1934, then pursued a Master of Science degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1936, before returning to Stanford to complete a post-master's engineering degree in electrical engineering in 1939.[^14] Hewlett attended undergraduate classes taught by Fred Terman at Stanford, where he became acquainted with David Packard.[^15] Hewlett was fortunate to study under and be mentored by Frederick Terman, one of Stanford's most famous professors, who was to a great degree responsible for the subsequent development of Silicon Valley.[^16] Terman helped fill the void left by Hewlett's father's death with encouragement and intellectual stimulation.[^17]

## Rise to Prominence

William Hewlett's path to prominence began during his Stanford years under the mentorship of Frederick Terman, whose best-known role was that of inspirational mentor to HP founders.[^18] During their undergraduate days, Hewlett and classmate David Packard acquired Terman as a mentor, and the legendary Stanford professor advised them to gain experience and knowledge before starting their own business.[^19] After Hewlett and Packard earned their Stanford undergraduate degrees in 1934 and moved east for graduate studies, Terman lured them back with fellowships and, according to legend, loaned them part of the $538 they used to start their firm.[^20]

The two founders first met as undergraduate students at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and their friendship blossomed during their time together in college, where they shared a love for innovation, engineering, and entrepreneurship.[^21] The two were both avid outdoorsmen with a fascination for electronics, and spent many weekends camping and fishing in the wilds of the Colorado mountains.[^22] Bill and Dave began discussing forming a company in August 1937, and officially founded the Hewlett-Packard Company as a partnership on January 1, 1939.[^23]

When it came to naming their company, the order of names in the original partnership was determined by a coin toss.[^24] Hewlett won the toss, resulting in the name Hewlett-Packard rather than Packard-Hewlett.[^25] The outcome might be seen as ironic: Hewlett, a quiet, self-effacing man, rarely put himself forward.[^26] In 1939, Hewlett and Packard established their enterprise in Packard's garage at 367 Addison Avenue in Palo Alto.[^27] David and Lucile Packard had married in 1938 and rented the first floor of the house, with the simple one-car garage becoming the HP workshop and a little shack out back becoming Bill Hewlett's home.[^28]

The company's first breakthrough came from Hewlett's academic work. Hewlett-Packard's first product, built in the garage, was an audio oscillator based on the Wien bridge oscillator circuit that had been the subject of Bill Hewlett's master's thesis.[^29] The key innovation was using a simple light bulb as the temperature-dependent resistor in its feedback network—the first such commercial oscillator to employ this technique.[^30] The light bulb was an inexpensive and effective automatic gain control that not only kept the oscillator output amplitude constant, but also kept the oscillator's loop gain near unity.[^31] Terman even suggested the idea for their first commercial product, the audio oscillator that would launch their success.[^32]

HP's rise accelerated dramatically when their innovation caught the attention of Walt Disney Studios. In 1938, Hewlett brought his new oscillator to a regional meeting of the Institute of Radio Engineers held in Portland, Oregon, where an engineer from Walt Disney Studios recognized the product was exactly what they needed for their advanced audio soundtrack for the groundbreaking movie Fantasia.[^33] Disney asked for modifications including a frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 KHz, and with a few component changes, the HP 200B was born.[^34] Disney purchased eight of the new oscillators to test the various channels, recording equipment, and speaker systems in the 12 specially equipped theaters that showed Fantasia in 1940.[^35] This sale to Disney was pivotal in launching HP as a company and helped establish what would eventually become Silicon Valley.[^36]

## Major Achievements

William Hewlett's career was marked by groundbreaking innovations and visionary leadership that transformed both technology and corporate culture. His invention of the audio oscillator represented the first practical method of generating audio signals needed in communications, geophysics, medicine, and defense work.[^37] In a 1985 letter, Dave Packard described Hewlett's audio oscillator as "the foundation on which Hewlett-Packard Company was able to grow into the largest manufacturer of electronic instruments in the world."[^38]

Following service in the U.S. Army Signal Corps during World War II, where he served as a Signal Corps Officer and led the electronics section of the Development Division, Hewlett returned to HP and was made a vice president in 1947.[^39][^40] He took ROTC at Stanford with a Commission of the Ordnance, and in mid-1941 was ordered to Washington for aviation ordnance, but his assignment was transferred to the Signal Corps Laboratories at Fort Monmouth.[^41] During the war, he worked for Colonel O'Connell in the office of the Chief Signal Officer, and in the final year worked for General Wharton in the new products division, where he was responsible for new products introduction.[^42] At just about the time the Japanese surrendered, he was transferred to an intelligence mission designed to take a quick look at what the Japanese had been doing technologically.[^43]

Hewlett's leadership roles expanded throughout his career. He was president of HP from 1964 to 1977 and CEO from 1968 to 1978.[^44] He remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then served as vice chairman of the board until 1987.[^45] Under his tenure, HP introduced revolutionary products that changed the computing landscape. The company produced the first desktop scientific calculator, the HP 9100A in 1968, followed by the pocket scientific calculator, the HP-35, in 1972, rendering slide rules largely obsolete.[^46]

The HP-35 represented one of Hewlett's most visionary achievements. In 1971, he challenged his engineers to miniaturize the company's 9100A Desktop Calculator—a forty-pound machine—into a device small enough to fit into a shirt pocket.[^47] The HP-35, measuring 5.8 inches long and 3.2 inches wide, was said to have been designed to fit into one of William Hewlett's shirt pockets.[^48] Despite market research concerns and a high retail cost of $395 (equivalent to $2,200 in 2015), the company's 1972 sales goal of selling 10,000 calculators was quickly exceeded—they sold 100,000.[^49] The HP-35 was the world's first scientific pocket calculator with trigonometric and exponential functions, and its innovation was that it was the first handheld device able to calculate transcendental functions.[^50] Hewlett-Packard Co. received the IEEE Corporate Innovation Recognition honor in June 1989 for "the creation, development and introduction of the first full-function, shirt-pocket-sized, scientific calculator," and Forbes ASAP magazine called the HP-35 one of the twenty products that changed the modern world.[^51]

Beyond technical innovation, Hewlett's most enduring achievement may be the corporate culture he created. Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard were proud of their company culture which came to be known as The HP Way, a corporate culture that claimed to be centered not only on making money but also on respecting and nurturing its employees.[^52] The HP Way was a progressive business philosophy implemented at Hewlett-Packard from the 1940s through the early 2000s, emphasizing management by objectives, teamwork, innovation, fiscal responsibility, and the obligation to improve society.[^53] Hewlett and Packard shared basic beliefs about managing a company: disdain of strict hierarchy and formality, admiration for individual creativity and initiative, and trust in employees.[^54]

The HP Way was built on five key principles: trust and respect for individuals, high achievement and contribution, uncompromising integrity, teamwork, and flexibility and innovation.[^55] Decades before today's creative management trends, Hewlett-Packard invented such strategies as 'walk-around management', 'flextime', and 'quality cycles'.[^56] HP's Open Door Policy was designed to help all employees feel comfortable enough to communicate their ideas and concerns to management, with Hewlett placing employees in open cubicles and creating offices without doors for executives.[^57] All employees had ownership stakes in the company, making HP the first large corporation to establish profit-sharing for all workers.[^58]

Hewlett's professional recognition was extensive. He was president of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 1954 and was elected to membership in the National Academy of Engineering in 1965.[^59] He became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1970, received the IEEE Founders Medal in 1973, became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1977, was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1992, and received the Lemelson-MIT Prize Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995.[^60] In 1983, he received the National Medal of Science from President Ronald Reagan for "his pioneering accomplishments in the creation and manufacturing of electronics and semiconductor devices and electronic test instruments."[^61] In 1987, he was awarded the Degree of Uncommon Man by Stanford University, its most prestigious award granted to alumni.[^62]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many tech pioneers, William Hewlett's career was notably free from major scandals or controversies. Most historical sources emphasize his positive legacy, corporate culture, philanthropy, and technical innovations.[^63] However, some criticisms emerged regarding his leadership approach during crucial transitional periods in the technology industry.

While his co-founder David Packard embraced bold changes, Hewlett was described as being "hell bent on sticking with HP's traditional research culture—prioritizing careful development over speed."[^64] His technical brilliance shaped HP's early success, yet as computing transformed in the 1970s and 1980s, his methodical, engineering-focused approach reportedly clashed with the rapid innovation needed to compete in personal computing.[^65] This conservative approach may have contributed to HP missing some opportunities during the personal computer revolution, though the company still achieved remarkable success under his leadership.

It's important to note that extensive searches for criticisms or controversies directly associated with William Hewlett personally yielded very limited results. The modern HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have faced extensive criticism for layoffs in the 2020s, but these occurred decades after William Hewlett's active leadership.[^66] Hewlett died in 2001, and he was CEO from 1968 to 1978, remained chairman of the executive committee until 1983, and then was vice chairman of the board until 1987.[^67] The challenges and controversies facing HP in subsequent decades cannot fairly be attributed to Hewlett himself.

The absence of significant controversies in Hewlett's career is itself noteworthy. In an industry often characterized by cutthroat competition and ethical lapses, Hewlett maintained a reputation for integrity and ethical business practices throughout his life. His commitment to "The HP Way" and its emphasis on uncompromising integrity appears to have been genuine rather than merely rhetorical.[^68]

## Personal Life

William Hewlett married Flora Lamson in 1939, the same year he co-founded Hewlett-Packard.[^69] Together, they had five children: Eleanor, Walter, James, William, and Mary, and twelve grandchildren.[^70] Flora died in 1977, ending a marriage that had spanned nearly four decades.[^71] In 1978, Hewlett married Rosemary Kopmeier Bradford, gaining five stepchildren through this second marriage.[^72]

Despite his immense wealth and success, Hewlett lived modestly for one of his position, preferring to raise his five children in Palo Alto rather than in more ostentatious surroundings.[^73] His personality was described as quiet and self-effacing, in contrast to the more assertive public personas of many technology leaders.[^74] Bill and Flora Hewlett cared deeply about the environment and cherished the mountains, meadows, forests, and coastlines of California and the American West.[^75] Bill was an amateur photographer of wildflowers, an accomplished botanist, and a lifelong climber, hiker, fisherman, and hunter.[^76]

Hewlett's affection for Stanford traced back to his radio engineering classes in a leaky attic lab during the Depression with Professor Frederick Terman.[^77] The two avid outdoorsmen—Hewlett and Packard—spent many weekends camping and fishing in the wilds of the Colorado mountains, cementing a friendship and partnership that would last a lifetime.[^78] This love of nature and the outdoors remained a constant throughout Hewlett's life, reflecting values he would later support through his philanthropic work.

William R. Hewlett died of heart failure in his sleep at his home in Palo Alto, California, on January 12, 2001, at age 87.[^79][^80] At the time of his death, he was Director Emeritus of Hewlett-Packard Company and was chairman of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation.[^81] He was interred at Los Gatos Memorial Park, San Jose, California.[^82] William Redington Hewlett was remembered as a skilled engineer and businessman who co-founded Hewlett-Packard Co. with his friend and partner, the late David Packard, in a garage in 1938, and was instrumental in the establishment of both Silicon Valley and the computer age.[^83]

## Legacy

William Hewlett's legacy extends far beyond the products he invented or the company he built. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue was registered as California Historical Landmark No. 976 and officially declared the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley," and was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[^84] This simple garage became a symbol of entrepreneurial innovation and the garage startup culture that would define Silicon Valley for generations.

Hewlett's invention of the audio oscillator marked HP's first major success, leading to significant advancements in various fields including medicine and military technology.[^85] Under Hewlett's leadership, HP became a trailblazer in the technology industry, developing products such as electronic test equipment and calculators, many of which set industry standards.[^86] The introduction of the HP-35 and similar scientific calculators by Texas Instruments soon thereafter signaled the demise of the slide rule among science and engineering students.[^87]

Perhaps Hewlett's most enduring legacy is the corporate culture he created. Hewlett emphasized a positive corporate culture known as "The HP Way," which valued employee contributions and fostered innovation.[^88] Inspired by Hewlett-Packard's management style, companies in the Valley emphasized flat organizational structures and encouraged direct interaction among employees, fostering innovation and agility, allowing for rapid development and adaptation of new ideas.[^89] Hewlett and Packard are considered two of the fathers of Silicon Valley, lauded for their innovative management style which fostered creativity and open communications between employees and managers.[^90]

The greatest legacy left by Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard is the geographic tech bubble of which they were pioneers.[^91] His legacy continues to influence technology and corporate practices globally, serving as an inspiration for future generations of entrepreneurs.[^92] Both men contributed $300 million to their alma mater, Stanford, and another $25 million to set up the Frederick Terman Fellowship to honor their Stanford professor-mentor.[^93]

Beyond corporate achievements, Hewlett's philanthropic legacy continues through the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, which he established with his first wife in 1966.[^94] According to SWF Institute, in 2023 the Hewlett Foundation was the ninth-wealthiest grantmaking foundation in the world with over $13 billion in assets.[^95] The foundation's program areas include Education, Environment, Global Development and Population, Performing Arts, Madison Initiative, Cyber, Effective Philanthropy, San Francisco Bay Area, and Special Projects.[^96] In 2024, the foundation awarded $631 million in grants, with nearly three-fourths of that total awarded as flexible funding.[^97]

Some of the foundation's most significant donations include a $400 million gift to Stanford University in 2001 for humanities, sciences, and undergraduate education—at the time, the largest on record to a university.[^98] In 2007, the Hewlett Foundation made a $113 million donation to the University of California, Berkeley to create 100 new endowed professorships and provide financial help for graduate students.[^99] The foundation announced in 2018 that it would donate $600 million over a five-year period from 2018-2023 to nonprofits globally working on solving climate change.[^100]

In 1995, Hewlett supported the founding of the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) with an endowment of $70 million.[^101] The institute, co-founded with Roger Heyns and Arjay Miller, performs independent and objective analyses of major economic, social, and political issues facing California.[^102] The Public Policy Institute of California is dedicated to informing and improving public policy in California through nonpartisan polling and policy research, coupled with active outreach and dissemination.[^103]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and business scholars consistently celebrate William Hewlett as one of the founding fathers of Silicon Valley and a pioneer of progressive corporate culture. Frederick Terman's role as inspirational mentor to HP founders William Hewlett and David Packard is widely recognized as instrumental in creating the Silicon Valley ecosystem.[^104] The HP Garage is universally acknowledged as the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley," representing the entrepreneurial spirit that would come to define the region.[^105]

Hewlett's technical innovations receive consistent praise from engineering communities. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 1992 for inventing the audio oscillator, which the organization described as "the first practical method of generating audio signals needed in communications, geophysics, medicine, and defense work."[^106] The IEEE recognized HP's pocket calculator innovation in 1989, acknowledging how Hewlett's vision had fundamentally transformed scientific computation.[^107]

Management scholars particularly celebrate "The HP Way" as a revolutionary approach to corporate culture. According to business historians, Hewlett and Packard "invented such strategies as 'walk-around management', 'flextime', and 'quality cycles'" decades before these became standard practices.[^108] The emphasis on trust, respect for individuals, and employee ownership made HP the first large corporation to establish profit-sharing for all workers, setting a standard that influenced corporate practices worldwide.[^109]

Philanthropic experts recognize the lasting impact of the Hewlett Foundation, which continues to reflect Bill and Flora Hewlett's values. Their spirit and regard for the well-being of nature and communities still guides the Hewlett Foundation's western conservation strategy and its grantmaking.[^110] The foundation's commitment to providing organizations with long-term, general operating support and focusing on problem-solving approaches across various program areas represents a thoughtful approach to philanthropy that contrasts with more restrictive giving models.[^111]

### Negative Views

Critical perspectives on William Hewlett are remarkably scarce in historical literature, suggesting either a genuinely exemplary career or insufficient critical examination. The most substantive criticism relates to his leadership style during the transition to personal computing. Some analysts argue that Hewlett's "methodical, engineering-focused approach clashed with the rapid innovation needed to compete in personal computing" during the crucial 1970s and 1980s period.[^112] His tendency toward "prioritizing careful development over speed" may have caused HP to miss opportunities during the PC revolution, though the company still achieved substantial success.[^113]

A few critics note that the HP Way, while innovative for its time, was developed collaboratively by both Hewlett and Packard, making it difficult to differentiate between their individual contributions.[^114] This collaborative nature means that crediting Hewlett alone for the management innovations may overstate his individual contribution. Additionally, as HP grew and changed leadership after Hewlett's active involvement ended, many argued that the company struggled to maintain the cultural values he had established, suggesting that the HP Way may have been too dependent on its founders' personal involvement.[^115]

However, the paucity of substantial criticisms is notable. Unlike contemporaries such as Bill Gates or Steve Jobs, who faced significant ethical controversies and criticism for competitive practices and management styles, Hewlett appears to have maintained a remarkably clean reputation throughout his career. This absence of major controversies may reflect either exceptional ethical standards or an era when business practices faced less scrutiny. Contemporary scholars should examine whether Hewlett's positive reputation reflects genuine exemplary behavior or incomplete historical analysis.
