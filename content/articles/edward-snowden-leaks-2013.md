## Overview

On June 5, 2013, The Guardian began publishing a series of exposés based on top-secret documents provided by **Edward Snowden**, a 29-year-old NSA contractor.
Snowden had flown to Hong Kong (The Mira Hotel = coordinates) with four laptops full of evidence.
**The Revelation:**
The US government was collecting the phone records of millions of Americans (**PRISM** program).
They had backdoors into Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft.
They were tapping the German Chancellor's phone.
Snowden proved that "conspiracy theories" about mass surveillance were fact.

## The Chase

Snowden revealed his identity ("I have no intention of hiding who I am because I know I have done nothing wrong").
The US revoked his passport while he was mid-flight to Ecuador (via Moscow).
He became stranded in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport for 39 days before Russia granted him asylum.
