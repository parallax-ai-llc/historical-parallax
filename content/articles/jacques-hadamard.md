## Summary

Jacques Hadamard was a French mathematician who made major contributions to number theory, complex analysis, differential geometry, and partial differential equations. He independently proved the prime number theorem in 1896, simultaneously with de la Vallée Poussin. He also developed the concept of well-posed problems in partial differential equations and Hadamard matrices.
