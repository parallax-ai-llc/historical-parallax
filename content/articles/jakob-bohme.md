## Summary

Jakob Böhme was a German Christian mystic and theologian who experienced profound visions and wrote influential works on the nature of God, evil, and creation. A shoemaker by trade, his first work Aurora was condemned by local authorities. His theosophical system influenced William Law, William Blake, Hegel, and many others. His concept of the divine 'Ungrund' (abyss without ground) anticipated later existentialist and process thought.
