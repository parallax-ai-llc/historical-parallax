## Summary

Christoph Scheiner was a German Jesuit priest, physicist, and astronomer who was one of the first to observe sunspots through a telescope, independently of Galileo. His systematic study of sunspots over many years was published in 'Rosa Ursina,' the most comprehensive work on sunspots of the 17th century. His priority dispute with Galileo over sunspot discovery became one of the most famous controversies in astronomy.
