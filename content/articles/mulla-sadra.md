## Summary

Mulla Sadra was a Persian Shia philosopher who is considered the most important Islamic philosopher of the past 400 years. He developed the philosophical school of Transcendent Theosophy (al-Hikma al-Muta'aliya), which synthesized Peripatetic philosophy, illuminationist philosophy, Sufism, and Shia theology. His magnum opus, the Asfar (Four Journeys), transformed Islamic metaphysics. His concept of substantial motion (al-haraka al-jawhariyya) was revolutionary.
