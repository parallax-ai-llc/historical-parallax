## Summary

In the summer of 2022, Sri Lankans did something extraordinary: they stormed their president's house, swam in his pool, and drove him from the country. The "Aragalaya" (Struggle) that began as desperate protests over fuel shortages and power cuts became a full-scale uprising that toppled the most powerful political dynasty in Sri Lankan history—the Rajapaksas. For a few remarkable days, the presidential palace became a people's museum, and ordinary citizens posed in the seat of power.[^1]

The backdrop was economic catastrophe. Sri Lanka had run out of foreign currency. There was no fuel for cars, no gas for cooking, no medicine in hospitals. Power cuts lasted 13 hours a day. Lines for petrol stretched for kilometers; people died waiting. The government that had presided over this disaster—through corruption, mismanagement, vanity projects, and disastrous policy experiments—seemed oblivious. When President Gotabaya Rajapaksa finally fled to the Maldives and then Singapore, few mourned.[^2]

The Aragalaya was unique: a peaceful protest that turned into an occupation, a revolution with swimming pools instead of barricades, a collective catharsis for a nation that had suffered too long under one family's rule. Whether it will bring lasting change remains to be seen. But for those who swam in Gota's pool, the message was clear: even presidents must answer to the people.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Rajapaksa Dynasty

**The family that dominated Sri Lankan politics for nearly two decades:**

| Name | Position |
|------|----------|
| Mahinda Rajapaksa | President (2005-2015); Prime Minister (2019-2022) |
| Gotabaya Rajapaksa | Defense Secretary; President (2019-2022) |
| Basil Rajapaksa | Finance Minister |
| Chamal Rajapaksa | Cabinet Minister |
| Namal Rajapaksa | Sports Minister (Mahinda's son) |

**Their claim to power:**
- Ended 26-year civil war with Tamil Tigers (2009)
- Victory made Mahinda a hero to the Sinhalese majority
- "War heroes" narrative sustained their popularity

**Their governance:**
- Accused of massive corruption
- Infrastructure mega-projects (often with Chinese loans)
- Authoritarian tendencies
- Nepotism on industrial scale[^4]

### Economic Mismanagement

**The crisis was years in the making:**

**Structural issues:**
- Heavy foreign borrowing (especially from China)
- Trade deficits
- Tourism-dependent economy
- COVID-19 devastated tourism (2020-2021)

**Policy disasters:**

  - Corporate tax: 28% → 24%
  - VAT: 15% → 8%
  - Lost $1.4 billion in annual revenue

- **April 2021:** Organic farming mandate
  - All chemical fertilizers banned overnight
  - Agricultural production collapsed
  - Rice harvest down 20%
  - Tea exports (major earner) devastated

**By late 2021:**
- Foreign reserves nearly exhausted
- Couldn't pay for essential imports
- Default looming[^5]

### The Collapse

**2022:**
- **March:** Fuel imports stopped due to lack of dollars
- **April:** Sri Lanka defaulted on foreign debt—first time ever
- Power cuts: 10-13 hours daily
- Cooking gas unavailable for weeks
- Medicine shortages critical
- Food prices soaring
- Transport paralyzed

**People were literally dying in queues waiting for fuel.**[^6]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did the Rajapaksas Fall?

**Immediate:**
- Economic collapse so severe it affected everyone
- Fuel and food shortages universal
- Middle class hit hard (usually protected)
- Even military and police families suffered

**Long-term:**
- Accumulated corruption
- Disastrous policy decisions
- COVID impact
- International isolation

### Why Was It Relatively Peaceful?

**Several factors:**
- Security forces ultimately did not massacre protesters
- Army maintained neutrality (mostly)
- Rajapaksas fled rather than fight
- Protest culture: Carnival-like atmosphere
- Media coverage prevented worst abuses

### What Did It Achieve?

**Successes:**
- Removed the Rajapaksa family from power
- Demonstrated people power
- Forced economic reckoning
- Inspired Sri Lankans about their own agency

**Limitations:**
- New president from establishment
- Economic crisis continues
- Structural reforms limited
- Rajapaksas may return[^14]

## Legacy

### For Sri Lanka

- **Aragalaya** now part of national memory
- Generation defined by those days
- But bittersweet: Crisis continued, hopes partly dashed
- 2024-2025: Testing whether change is lasting

### For the World

**Lessons:**
- Economic collapse can topple even popular regimes
- Social media organizing effective
- Peaceful occupation can succeed
- But the day after revolution is harder than the revolution itself

**Comparison:**
- Ecuador 2000, 2005 (presidents fled)
- Bangladesh 2024 (similar dynamics)
- Bolivia 2019 (economic-political crisis)[^15]

### The Image

**Swimming in the president's pool:**
- Became iconic globally
- Perfect metaphor for revolution
- The people literally occupying the symbols of power
- Joy and defiance combined
