## Overview

Richard Sorge was a hard-drinking, womanizing German journalist in Tokyo who was secretly a Soviet GRU master spy. He infiltrated the German Embassy, becoming best friends with the ambassador. He read top-secret documents on the ambassador's desk.
**The Warning:**
In May 1941, he warned Moscow that Hitler would invade on June 22. Stalin ignored him ("Sorge is a shit who just wants to set up factories in Tokyo").
**The Savior:**
In Sept 1941, he reported that Japan would **not** attack the Soviet Union (they would strike south at the US/UK instead).
Stalin finally believed him. He moved 18 Siberian divisions to Moscow (Zhukov's reserves), which stopped the Germans at the Battle of Moscow.

## The End

Japanese secret police (Kempeitai) grew suspicious of his Japanese associates (Ozaki).
Sorge was arrested in Oct 1941.
**Stalin's Betrayal:**
The Japanese offered to trade him for Japanese prisoners. Stalin replied: *"Richard Sorge? I don't know this man."*
He was hanged in Sugamo Prison on Nov 7, 1944 (Revolution Day).
