## Summary

Abdul Haris Nasution (3 December 1918 – 6 September 2000) was one of Indonesia's most influential military leaders and political figures, serving as Army Chief of Staff during crucial periods of the nation's history.[^1] A Mandailing Batak from North Sumatra, he developed the territorial warfare doctrine that became the foundation of Indonesia's military strategy and survived an assassination attempt during the 1965 coup that killed his five-year-old daughter.[^2] Rising from Dutch colonial military training to become one of only three five-star generals in Indonesian history, Nasution played pivotal roles in the independence revolution, suppression of regional rebellions, the anti-communist purges of 1965-66, and ultimately emerged as a critic of the Suharto regime that he helped bring to power.[^3] His legacy remains deeply contested, revered by some as a founding architect of the Indonesian military and condemned by others for his role in mass violence and authoritarian military-political structures.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Abdul Haris Nasution was born on 3 December 1918 in the village of Hutapungkut, Mandailing Natal Regency, North Sumatra, into a Muslim Mandailing Batak family.[^5] He was the second child of his parents and the oldest son in a family of modest means.[^6] His father was a trader who sold textiles, rubber, and coffee, and was a member of Sarekat Islam, one of the earliest Indonesian nationalist organizations.[^7] The Nasution clan is one of the largest and most prominent Mandailing marga (patriarchal clans), with many Mandailing people being of Minangkabau descent from Pagaruyung.[^8]

Growing up in colonial North Sumatra, Nasution received an education that was rare for native Indonesians of his generation. After graduating from elementary school in 1932, he received a scholarship to study teaching at Bukitinggi, demonstrating early academic promise.[^9] In 1935, Nasution moved to Bandung to continue his studies, where he remained for three years at a normal school, graduating in 1938.[^10] He then taught school in West Java, experiencing firsthand the limitations placed on educated indigenous Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule.[^11]

The outbreak of World War II in Europe transformed Nasution's prospects. When Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands in 1940, the Dutch colonial authorities in the East Indies found themselves cut off from their metropolitan military training institutions and established an officer reserve corps that, for the first time, admitted pribumi (native Indonesians).[^12] Nasution seized this opportunity, recognizing it as the only way for an indigenous Indonesian to obtain formal military training.[^13] Along with a few other Indonesians, including T.B. Simatupang, he entered the Royal Military Academy (Koninklijke Militaire Academie) in Bandung in October 1940.[^14]

Nasution's military education progressed rapidly. In September 1940 he was promoted to corporal, then three months later to sergeant.[^15] Following his graduation from the academy in 1940, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL).[^16] This made him one of a very few Indonesians in the colonial army who had formal officer training under the Dutch and served in a commissioned capacity prior to World War II.[^17] Both Nasution and Simatupang would eventually surpass the rank of officers who graduated from the prestigious Royal Military Academy in Breda, Netherlands, reaching the pinnacle of military leadership in independent Indonesia.[^18]

The Japanese occupation of Indonesia from 1942 to 1945 further shaped Nasution's military experience and nationalist consciousness. During this period, he witnessed the humiliation of Dutch colonial power and the mobilization of Indonesian society under Japanese military administration. These formative experiences—his Mandailing Batak background emphasizing communal defense, his education in both traditional Islamic and modern Western systems, his rare military training under the Dutch, and his experience of both colonial oppression and Japanese occupation—forged the military theorist and nationalist leader who would help shape Indonesia's post-independence trajectory.[^19]

## Rise to Power

When Sukarno proclaimed Indonesia's independence on 17 August 1945, Nasution immediately joined the fledgling Indonesian Army, then known as the People's Security Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakyat, TKR).[^20] The new republic faced an existential threat as Dutch forces returned to reassert colonial control, launching what would become the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949). Nasution's formal military training made him a valuable asset in an army composed largely of untrained volunteers and former Japanese-trained soldiers.[^21]

In May 1946, at just 27 years old, Nasution was appointed Regional Commander of the Siliwangi Division, which was responsible for the security of West Java.[^22] This position proved crucial to his rise and to the development of Indonesian military doctrine. Facing a technologically superior Dutch military force, Nasution recognized that conventional warfare was impossible. In this context, he developed his theory of territorial warfare (perang wilayah), which would become the future defense doctrine of the Indonesian Army.[^23] This doctrine envisioned the entire territory and population of Indonesia as a defense system, dividing war zones into territorial compartments that could independently resist invasion, based partly on the German Wehrkreise system.[^24]

Nasution demonstrated superior abilities as a field commander during the revolution, earning respect for his tactical acumen and strategic thinking.[^25] His forces successfully conducted guerrilla operations against the Dutch during the colonial military actions of 1947 and 1948. The territorial warfare concept proved effective, allowing Indonesian forces to maintain resistance even when major cities fell to Dutch control. Nasution later refined this concept, introducing three phases of defensive operations: opposing an enemy attack; containment, challenge and consolidation; and counteroffensive.[^26]

In 1948, Nasution faced another formative experience when Communist forces attempted a coup in Madiun. As a rising military leader, he participated in the ruthless suppression of this revolt, establishing his anti-communist credentials that would define much of his subsequent career.[^27] Following the end of the national revolution and the Dutch recognition of Indonesian independence in 1949, Nasution was appointed Chief of Staff of the Army, becoming one of the most powerful military figures in the new nation at age 31.[^28]

However, Nasution's rise was not without setbacks. In 1952, he became involved in the "October 17 Affair," when senior military officers including Nasution and Armed Forces Chief Tahi Bonar Simatupang took control of Jakarta and urged President Sukarno to dissolve the parliament and hold immediate elections.[^29] The military's action was prompted by parliamentary attempts to restructure the army leadership and reduce military expenditures, which Nasution and Simatupang perceived as unacceptable civilian interference in military affairs.[^30] The gambit failed, and both officers were removed from their posts in November 1952, with Nasution being replaced by Bambang Soegeng as Army Chief of Staff.[^31]

This forced hiatus from power proved temporary. In October 1955, as Indonesia's parliamentary democracy struggled with regional tensions and political fragmentation, Nasution was reappointed as Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army.[^32] He returned to power with determination to professionalize the military and increase its influence in national affairs. He formulated a tour of duty system ensuring officers would be stationed around the country to gain experience and become more professional; centralized military training to ensure uniform methods; and worked systematically to increase the army's political power and influence.[^33] By the late 1950s, Nasution had transformed himself from a disgraced officer into the most powerful military leader in Indonesia, positioning the army as an increasingly central force in Indonesian politics, society, and daily life.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Nasution's most enduring intellectual contribution was his development of Indonesia's territorial warfare doctrine (doktrin pertahanan rakyat semesta), which remains influential in Indonesian military thinking today.[^35] His conception of "Total People's War" (Perang Rakyat Semesta), first articulated in 1951 and refined throughout the 1950s, envisioned warfare as encompassing political, economic, sociopsychological, and military dimensions intertwined during both peace and war.[^36] The doctrine differentiated war into five phases, driven by three elements: mobile strategic reserve units, regional territorial units, and territorial militia units.[^37] This framework became the foundation for Indonesia's defense posture and demonstrated Nasution's broad knowledge of military theory, drawing from German, Soviet, and Chinese military thought adapted to Indonesian conditions.[^38]

In 1958, Nasution faced his greatest military challenge when regional commanders in Sumatra and Sulawesi launched rebellions against the central government, establishing the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) and the Permesta movement.[^39] These revolts stemmed from dissatisfaction with economic policies, perceived Javanese domination, and opposition to President Sukarno's growing alignment with the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI).[^40] As Army Chief of Staff, Nasution took personal command of the counterinsurgency operations. In March 1958, he conducted surprise amphibious assaults on rebel cities in Sumatra, ordering paratroopers dropped near Pekanbaru oil fields and landing troops from the Diponegoro and Siliwangi Divisions at Padang under Colonel Ahmad Yani.[^41] The Indonesian Air Force bombed rebel strongholds in Padang, Bukittinggi, and Manado.[^42] Nasution's forces successfully crushed the rebellions, though at considerable cost—he later noted that operations claimed 7,146 lives, with 6,115 from the rebel side.[^43] The campaign's success cemented central authority in the outer islands, led to the forced retirement of many officers from Sumatra and the eastern archipelago (making the officer corps more Javanese and loyal to Sukarno), and elevated Nasution to lieutenant general and recognition as Indonesia's most powerful military leader.[^44]

Perhaps Nasution's most significant institutional achievement was developing the doctrine of dwifungsi (dual function), which justified permanent military involvement in civilian governance.[^45] Initially called the "middle way," Nasution first articulated this concept in 1958 at the Military Academy, arguing that the Indonesian armed forces should be neither "a tool of civilian society" as in Western countries nor a "military regime" that dominates the state, but rather "a force of the people, working with other forces of the people."[^46] He formally introduced the term dwifungsi in 1960 at a Police Leadership Meeting in Porong.[^47] This doctrine provided ideological justification for military officers to occupy positions throughout the civilian bureaucracy, for reserved military-only seats in parliament, and for the army's extensive territorial command structure that paralleled civilian administration down to the village level.[^48] While this doctrine was later used by Suharto to justify authoritarian military rule, Nasution originally conceived it as a way for the military to "save the nation" during periods of political instability.[^49]

On 28 June 1962, Nasution was appointed Minister of Defense and Security, then Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces (1959-1962), consolidating his position at the apex of Indonesia's military hierarchy.[^50] In these roles, he devoted himself with "single-minded intensity" to creating a modern, well-trained, and effective defense establishment for Indonesia.[^51] He unified elements trained by the Dutch, the Japanese, and irregular citizen soldiers into a coherent national army.[^52] His published works on military subjects demonstrated broad knowledge of the technical literature of his profession, earning him recognition as a serious military theorist, with his book "Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare" (Pokok-pokok Gerilya) becoming influential in Southeast Asian military circles.[^53]

In 1997, at age 79, Nasution received Indonesia's highest military honor when he was promoted to the five-star rank of Jenderal Besar (Grand General) through Presidential Decree No. 45/ABRI/1997, alongside Sudirman (posthumously) and Suharto.[^54] He became one of only three individuals in Indonesian history to hold this honorary rank, recognizing his role as a founding architect of the Indonesian military and his survival of the 1965 assassination attempt.[^55] Though the rank conferred no additional authority, it represented official acknowledgment of his central role in Indonesian military history and his status as a national hero.[^56]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most damning controversy surrounding Nasution involves his role in the Indonesian mass killings of 1965-66, in which between 500,000 to over one million alleged communists and suspected sympathizers were murdered following the failed coup attempt.[^57] On November 12, 1965, General Nasution told student action front members that "the PKI has clearly betrayed the state and nation… and therefore we are obliged and duty bound to wipe them from the soil of Indonesia."[^58] The U.S. Embassy reported that Nasution "expressed his determination to continue the campaign to repress the PKI, which has reached the stage of mass executions in several Indonesian provinces."[^59] The funeral for Nasution's daughter, killed during the coup attempt, was identified as "the spark that set off anti-PKI violence."[^60] At the generals' graveside ceremony, Nasution invoked religious themes, speaking of how the army had been "insulted" and calling upon Allah for guidance, effectively blessing the coming massacre.[^61] Together with General Suharto, Nasution led the army's retaliation and supervised operations during which hundreds of thousands of real and suspected communists were massacred.[^62] Western powers aided the slaughter, with Sweden signing a contract with Suharto and Nasution for an emergency purchase of $10 million worth of small arms and ammunition in December 1965.[^63] Modern scholars have documented that the army actively organized, encouraged, and in many cases directly perpetrated these killings, making Nasution, as Defense Minister, institutionally and morally complicit in what some scholars classify as genocide.[^64]

Nasution's creation and promotion of the dwifungsi doctrine has been widely criticized as laying the ideological foundation for decades of military authoritarianism in Indonesia.[^65] While originally conceived as a "middle way" between civilian control and military dictatorship, in practice dwifungsi enabled the military to dominate Indonesian politics, economics, and society from the 1960s through the end of the New Order in 1998.[^66] The doctrine justified military officers occupying positions throughout the civilian bureaucracy, reserved seats for military appointees in parliament (who were not elected), and an extensive territorial command structure that gave the military surveillance and control capabilities down to the village level.[^67] Critics argue that Nasution's framework created a "shadow state" that undermined democratic civilian governance and facilitated widespread human rights abuses.[^68] Even after the fall of Suharto and the official abolition of dwifungsi in 2000, scholars note that the structural legacy of Nasution's military-political architecture continues to influence Indonesian civil-military relations.[^69]

The October 17 Affair of 1952 revealed Nasution's willingness to use military force to override civilian democratic authority.[^70] When the elected parliament moved to restructure the army leadership and reduce military expenditures following the economic difficulties of the post-Korean War period, Nasution and other senior officers took control of Jakarta and pressured President Sukarno to dissolve the government.[^71] This attempted military intervention in democratic politics, though ultimately unsuccessful, established a precedent for military involvement in political affairs that would characterize much of Indonesia's subsequent history.[^72] Nasution's justification—that parliament was engaging in unacceptable "interference in military affairs"—reflected an anti-democratic mindset that prioritized military autonomy over civilian oversight.[^73]

Nasution's suppression of the PRRI/Permesta rebellions in 1958, while militarily successful, has been criticized for its brutality and for consolidating Javanese military domination over the outer islands.[^74] The operations resulted in over 7,000 deaths and led to the forced retirement of many officers from Sumatra and the eastern archipelago, making the officer corps proportionately more Javanese.[^75] This contributed to perceptions of Javanese imperialism and exacerbated ethnic and regional tensions that persist in Indonesia.[^76] The campaign's success in imposing central authority came at the cost of legitimate regional grievances about economic exploitation and political marginalization, issues that would resurface in later separatist movements in Aceh, Papua, and elsewhere.[^77]

Critics also point to the problematic legacy of territorial warfare doctrine, which while effective against colonial powers, was later weaponized for internal repression.[^78] The territorial command structure that Nasution developed gave the military extensive surveillance capabilities and presence throughout Indonesian society, which was used not primarily for external defense but for monitoring and controlling civilian populations.[^79] This system facilitated military involvement in human rights abuses in East Timor, Aceh, Papua, and other regions where the military conducted counterinsurgency operations against separatist movements and civilian populations.[^80] The Indonesian army's association with periodic human rights violations can be traced in part to the institutional structures and doctrines that Nasution created.[^81]

## Personal Life

Abdul Haris Nasution was married to Johanna Sunarti Nasution (née Gondokusumo), a Surabaya-born humanitarian born on 1 November 1923.[^82] Johanna was the daughter of Gondokusumo, a fighter from the Dr. Soetomo generation of Indonesian nationalists.[^83] The couple had two daughters: Hendriyanti Sahara (24 February 1952 – 18 June 2021) and Ade Irma Suryani Nasution.[^84]

The defining tragedy of Nasution's personal life occurred during the early morning hours of 1 October 1965, when troops from the presidential palace guard attempted to kidnap him as part of the September 30th Movement coup attempt.[^85] Nasution and his wife were awake when the attackers stormed their home.[^86] In the chaos of the assault, Nasution managed to escape by scaling a wall into the garden of the Iraqi ambassador's residence next door, where he hid while the attackers searched for him.[^87] However, his five-year-old daughter Ade Irma Suryani was not so fortunate. Nasution's sister Mardiah grabbed young Irma from her bed and tried to run to safety, but a corporal from the palace guard fired shots through a door, hitting Mardiah in the hand and striking Irma with three bullets in her spine.[^88] The child reportedly tried to shield her father during the attack.[^89] Ade Irma Suryani died five days later on 6 October 1965 in the hospital.[^90] During the attack, Nasution's older daughter Hendriyanti and her nurse hid under a bed and survived.[^91] Also killed in the assault was First Lieutenant Pierre Andries Tendean, Nasution's adjutant, who was mistaken for Nasution and kidnapped, later to be murdered along with six other generals.[^92]

The death of his young daughter profoundly affected Nasution and became a catalyst for the massive anti-communist violence that followed. The funeral became a focal point for anti-PKI sentiment, and Nasution's emotional graveside remarks helped inflame the atmosphere that led to mass killings.[^93] The family home was later converted into the General Abdul Haris Nasution Museum, preserving the bullet holes and damage from the attack as a memorial to the events of 1965.[^94]

Nasution's wife Johanna was a distinguished social worker and humanitarian who devoted most of her life to charity work.[^95] She established several foundations including the Bina Wicara Foundation (for speech therapy), Jambangan Kasih Foundation, Panti Usada Mulia Foundation, and Santi Rama Foundation.[^96] On 31 August 1981, she received the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in recognition of her humanitarian work.[^97] Johanna outlived her husband by a decade, passing away on 20 March 2010 at age 87.[^98] Her body was buried next to her husband's grave at Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in South Jakarta.[^99] She was survived by four grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and her remaining daughter Hendriyanti.[^100]

As a Mandailing Batak, Nasution maintained connections to his ethnic and cultural heritage throughout his life, though as a devout Muslim and nationalist, his primary identity was Indonesian rather than narrowly ethnic.[^101] The Mandailing people, who are almost entirely Muslim, occupy a unique position among the Batak groups of North Sumatra, and Nasution exemplified the community's emphasis on education, commerce, and military service.[^102]

## Legacy

Abdul Haris Nasution's legacy as a founding architect of the Indonesian military remains powerfully influential more than two decades after his death. Modern assessments indicate that Indonesia's post-New Order "Reform Era" democratic system has never fully dismantled the "shadow state" structure of the armed forces that Nasution designed, with his institutional and doctrinal frameworks still looming large in contemporary Indonesia.[^103] The territorial command structure he created continues to give the military extensive presence throughout Indonesian society, even as formal political roles have been reduced.[^104] His conception of "Total People's Defense" (Pertahanan Rakyat Semesta) remains part of official Indonesian military doctrine, demonstrating the enduring relevance of his strategic thinking.[^105]

Nasution's intellectual contributions to military theory extend beyond Indonesia. His work on territorial warfare and guerrilla strategy influenced military thinking throughout Southeast Asia and the developing world during the Cold War era.[^106] His book "Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare" demonstrated that a formally colonized people could develop sophisticated military doctrine adapted to their specific geographic, social, and political conditions.[^107] Scholars studying civil-military relations, counterinsurgency, and the political role of militaries in developing nations continue to examine Nasution's theories and their implementation.[^108] A 2018 Royal United Services Institute podcast described him as the "Insurgent Founder of the Indonesian Army," recognizing his dual role as revolutionary guerrilla commander and institutional state-builder.[^109]

The dwifungsi doctrine Nasution created became the defining framework for Indonesian civil-military relations for four decades, fundamentally shaping the character of the New Order regime under Suharto (1966-1998).[^110] Though officially abolished in 2000 during the presidency of Abdurrahman Wahid, recent legislative developments have raised concerns about its potential revival.[^111] A controversial military law passed unanimously by the Indonesian parliament in recent years has been interpreted by observers as designed to bring back elements of the dual function doctrine, demonstrating that Nasution's vision of military involvement in civilian affairs remains attractive to some political forces.[^112] This persistence suggests that understanding Nasution's thinking is vital for comprehending the broader trajectory of Indonesian political history and ongoing debates about the military's proper role in a democracy.[^113]

Nasution's physical legacy is preserved in the General Abdul Haris Nasution Museum in Jakarta, housed in his former residence where the 1965 assassination attempt occurred.[^114] The museum preserves bullet holes and damage from the attack, serving as both a memorial to the victims of the September 30th Movement and a testament to the violent political conflicts that shaped modern Indonesia.[^115] Thousands of visitors, particularly on the anniversary of the 1965 events, visit the museum to learn about this pivotal moment in Indonesian history.[^116] The site has become part of the official narrative of the 1965 coup attempt, though this narrative remains contested by those who question the military's role in the subsequent mass killings.[^117]

As one of only three five-star generals in Indonesian history, Nasution occupies a place in the pantheon of the nation's founding generation alongside figures like Sukarno, Hatta, and Sudirman.[^118] His journey from a village in North Sumatra to the highest echelons of military and political power embodies narratives of merit, education, and nationalist struggle that resonate in Indonesian collective memory.[^119] Yet his legacy remains deeply contested, with his role in mass violence, authoritarian structures, and the suppression of regional autonomy generating criticism that complicates heroic narratives.[^120] The ongoing debate about Nasution's legacy reflects broader unresolved questions about Indonesia's transition from colonialism to independence to authoritarianism to democracy, and the military's role throughout these transformations.[^121]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly admirers of Nasution emphasize his role as a brilliant military theorist whose strategic innovations were essential to Indonesian independence and state formation.[^122] Barry Turner's book "A.H. Nasution and Indonesia's Elites: 'People's Resistance' in the War of Independence and Postwar Politics" portrays Nasution as a sophisticated thinker who creatively adapted international military theory to Indonesian conditions.[^123] Turner and other scholars note that Nasution had a "superior record as a field officer in the fighting against the Dutch during the revolution," demonstrating both tactical competence and strategic vision that were rare in the revolutionary period.[^124] His development of territorial warfare doctrine is viewed by military historians as an intellectual achievement comparable to Mao Zedong's theories of people's war or Vo Nguyen Giap's strategy in Vietnam, representing indigenous military thought rather than mere imitation of foreign models.[^125]

Defenders argue that Nasution's institutional state-building was essential for creating national unity in the diverse Indonesian archipelago.[^126] His efforts to professionalize the military—establishing uniform training systems, creating a tour of duty rotation that exposed officers to different regions, and unifying forces that had been trained by Dutch, Japanese, and various revolutionary militias—transformed a collection of irregular armed groups into a coherent national institution.[^127] Supporters contend that without Nasution's military reforms and his forceful suppression of the PRRI/Permesta rebellions, Indonesia might have fragmented into multiple states, as occurred in British India or the former Dutch West Indies.[^128] From this perspective, Nasution's centralization efforts, though harsh, preserved Indonesian unity and territorial integrity.[^129]

Some scholars present Nasution as a tragic figure whose original "middle way" concept was corrupted by Suharto into authoritarian dwifungsi.[^130] They note that Nasution himself became a victim of the military's political involvement when Suharto, viewing him as a rival, systematically pushed him out of power in the early 1970s.[^131] After his removal from influence, Nasution "developed into a political opponent of Suharto's New Order Regime," even being barred from speaking at military educational institutions.[^132] This narrative portrays Nasution as an advocate for a balanced military role rather than military domination, whose ideas were hijacked for purposes he did not originally intend.[^133] His later opposition to Suharto, according to this interpretation, demonstrates that he recognized and rejected the authoritarian trajectory of Indonesian politics.[^134]

Defenders also emphasize Nasution's anti-communist credentials as appropriate given the historical context of the Cold War and the genuine threat posed by the PKI, which by 1965 was one of the world's largest communist parties.[^135] They argue that Nasution's fierce response to the 1965 coup attempt was understandable given that the coup plotters had murdered his daughter and six fellow generals.[^136] From this perspective, his role in the anti-PKI campaign, while tragic, prevented Indonesia from becoming a communist state and kept the nation aligned with the West during a critical period of the Cold War.[^137]

### Negative Views

Critics portray Nasution as an architect of authoritarianism whose dwifungsi doctrine provided ideological justification for decades of military repression and human rights abuses.[^138] Scholars of Indonesian politics argue that the "middle way" was never genuinely balanced, but rather a formula for permanent military dominance over civilian institutions.[^139] The territorial command structure Nasution created gave the military surveillance and control capabilities that were used not primarily for external defense but for monitoring and repressing civilian populations.[^140] Research has documented that this system facilitated military involvement in systematic human rights violations in East Timor (where approximately 100,000-180,000 people died under Indonesian occupation), Aceh, Papua, and other regions.[^141] The ongoing impunity for military abuses, critics argue, stems directly from the autonomy and political power that Nasution's doctrines institutionalized.[^142]

The harshest criticism focuses on Nasution's role in the 1965-66 mass killings, which scholars increasingly describe as genocide.[^143] Detailed research by historians has documented that the Indonesian Army, under Nasution's leadership as Defense Minister, actively organized, encouraged, armed civilian militias, provided transportation and logistical support, and in many cases directly perpetrated mass executions.[^144] Recent archival discoveries, including U.S. diplomatic cables, confirm that Nasution personally directed the campaign and expressed determination to continue mass executions.[^145] His inflammatory rhetoric at his daughter's funeral, invoking religious themes and speaking of the need to "wipe" communists from Indonesian soil, helped create the atmosphere of sanctioned violence.[^146] Critics reject narratives that portray these killings as spontaneous popular violence, instead documenting systematic military planning and execution in which Nasution, as a senior commander, bore command responsibility for crimes against humanity.[^147]

Scholars critical of Nasution's legacy point to the October 17 Affair as revealing his fundamentally anti-democratic instincts.[^148] His willingness to use military force to override elected civilian authorities when they attempted legitimate oversight of military affairs demonstrated contempt for democratic governance.[^149] This episode, critics argue, established a precedent for military intervention in politics that would plague Indonesia for decades, contributing to the political instability that ultimately enabled Suharto's authoritarian New Order.[^150] Nasution's conception of military "professionalism" rejected the principle of civilian supremacy that characterizes truly professional militaries in democratic societies.[^151]

Human rights organizations and scholars have condemned the denial of the 1965-66 genocide, which the military's official narrative—shaped significantly by Nasution—has promoted for decades.[^152] The ongoing impunity has made genuine inquiry into the genocide "politically dangerous" and enabled further military abuses in multiple regions.[^153] Critics argue that Nasution's legacy includes not only the killings themselves but also the culture of impunity and historical denial that prevents accountability and reconciliation.[^154] The fact that he was honored as a national hero and promoted to five-star general rather than investigated for crimes against humanity reflects, in this view, Indonesia's failure to confront its violent past and the continued power of the military institutions Nasution created.[^155]

Recent scholarship has also criticized Nasution's role in entrenching Javanese military domination over the outer islands, contributing to ethnic and regional tensions that continue to destabilize Indonesia.[^156] The forced retirement of Sumatran and eastern Indonesian officers after the PRRI/Permesta rebellions, combined with the centralized territorial system that subordinated regional autonomy to Jakarta's control, created structures of internal colonialism that fuel ongoing conflicts in Papua, Aceh, and elsewhere.[^157] From this perspective, Nasution's "national unity" came at the cost of suppressing legitimate regional diversity and grievances, creating a Javanese-dominated military that resembles an occupying force in parts of the archipelago.[^158]
