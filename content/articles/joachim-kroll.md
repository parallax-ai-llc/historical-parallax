## Summary
Joachim Kroll, the 'Ruhr Cannibal,' was a German serial killer who murdered at least 14 people between 1955 and 1976. He was caught when neighbors reported a blocked drain caused by human flesh he was attempting to flush. He practiced cannibalism on his victims.

## Early Life
Born April 17, 1933, in Hindenburg, Germany (now Zabrze, Poland). He had a low IQ and was considered mentally deficient. He worked as a toilet attendant. He was quiet and unassuming, allowing him to avoid suspicion. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1955 and 1976, Kroll murdered at least 14 people in the Ruhr industrial area. He targeted women and children, raping and strangling them. He practiced cannibalism, keeping human meat in his refrigerator alongside animal meat to save on grocery costs. Other men were wrongfully convicted of some of his murders. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
On July 3, 1976, a neighbor in Duisburg reported a blocked drain. A plumber found it clogged with human flesh. Police found body parts in Kroll's apartment. He was convicted of eight murders and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died in prison on July 1, 1991. [^3]
