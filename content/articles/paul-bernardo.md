## Summary
Paul Bernardo, the 'Scarborough Rapist,' committed at least 13 rapes and, with wife Karla Homolka, murdered three teenage girls in Ontario. A DNA backlog allowed him to continue offending for years. He was convicted of first-degree murder and designated a dangerous offender in 1995.

## Early Life
Born August 27, 1964, in Scarborough, Ontario. Outwardly charming, he graduated from University of Toronto Scarborough with an accounting degree. He began committing sexual assaults in 1987. [^1]

## Capture / Downfall
