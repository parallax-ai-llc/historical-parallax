## Summary

Al-Ash'ari was an Islamic theologian who founded the Ash'ari school of theology, which became the dominant theological school in Sunni Islam. He initially followed the rationalist Mu'tazila school but broke with them to defend traditional beliefs using rational methods. His synthesis of reason and tradition defined mainstream Sunni theology for centuries. His key works include Maqalat al-Islamiyyin and al-Ibana.
