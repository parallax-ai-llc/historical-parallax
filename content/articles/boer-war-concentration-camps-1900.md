## 1. Introduction: "Methods of Barbarism"
The Second Boer War (1899–1902) gave the world the modern concept of the **"concentration camp."** While the British did not invent the idea of internment (the Spanish did in Cuba), they industrialized it. To defeat the Boer guerrilla resistance, the British Army under **Lord Kitchener** waged war on civilians, systematically burning farms and imprisoning women and children in tent cities where negligence, starvation, and disease killed nearly 50,000 people.

## 2. The Strategic Shift: Scorched Earth
By late 1900, the British had captured the major Boer capitals, but the Boers refused to surrender. "Bittereinders" (bitter-enders) formed mobile commandos that struck British supply lines.
*   **The Support Network:** The commandos relied on their farmsteads for food, horses, and shelter.
*   **Kitchener's Solution:** Lord Kitchener initiated a "Scorched Earth" policy. The British Army swept through the veld, systematically destroying everything that could sustain life.
*   **The Destruction:** Over **30,000 farmhouses** were burned to the ground. 4 million sheep and cattle were slaughtered or confiscated.
*   **The Displaced:** The women, children, and elderly inhabitants were left homeless. Kitchener ordered them rounded up and "concentrated" in camps along the railway lines to prevent them from feeding the guerrillas.

## 3. The White Concentration Camps
There were 45 tented camps for the Boer population, housing roughly 115,000 people.
*   **The Ration Policy:** The administration was punitive. Inmates were divided into two classes.
    *   **Class A:** Families of men who had surrendered ("hands-uppers").
    *   **Class B:** Families of men who were still fighting. These women and children were given significantly smaller rations and **no meat**. The British government explicitly used the slow starvation of children as a weapon to force their fathers to surrender.
*   **Conditions:** Tents were overcrowded and rotting. There was no soap, no vegetables, and inadequate bedding.
*   **Disease:** The camps became breeding grounds for measles, typhoid fever, and dysentery.
*   **Lizzie van Zyl:** A photograph of 7-year-old Lizzie van Zyl, a skeletal child who died in the Bloemfontein camp, became the symbol of the suffering. She was reportedly neglected by British nurses who claimed she was an "idiot" because she couldn't speak English.
*   **The Death Toll:** **27,927 Boers died** in the camps. Of these, **22,074 were children** under the age of 16. This represented 10% of the entire Boer population.

## 4. The Black Concentration Camps
Often erased from popular history, the British also cleared the land of Black Africans (tenant farmers, servants, and laborers) to deny the Boers their labor force and to secure their own labor for the army and gold mines.
*   **Scope:** Approximately 115,000 Black Africans were held in 64 segregated camps.
*   **Conditions:** Conditions were far worse than in the white camps. Black internees received **zero food rations** in many camps and were forced to grow their own crops or starve. They had almost no access to medical care and were forced to pay for their own food.
*   **Forced Labor:** Men in these camps were often forced to work for the British Army.
*   **Casualties:** The recorded death toll was **at least 20,000**, though records were poorly kept, and the true figure is likely much higher. 81% of the dead were children.

## 5. Emily Hobhouse: The Whistleblower
The British public was largely unaware of the horror until **Emily Hobhouse**, a liberal welfare campaigner, went to South Africa.
*   **The Visit (1901):** She visited the camps in the Free State, smuggling in soap and clothes. She was appalled by the stench, the skeletons, and the mass death.
*   **The Report:** She returned to England and published her findings. She described the system as "wholesale murder."
*   **The Reaction:** The establishment vilified her as a "Boer sympathizer." However, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the Liberal opposition leader, famously declared: *"When is a war not a war? When it is carried on by methods of barbarism in South Africa."*
*   **The Fawcett Commission:** Under pressure, the government sent Millicent Fawcett to investigate. Despite being pro-war, her commission confirmed Hobhouse's report.
*   **Reform:** Management was transferred from the military to civilians (Lord Milner). Rations were increased, hygiene improved, and the death rate dropped sharply by 1902.

## 6. Legacy: The Seeds of Apartheid
The concentration camps left a deep psychological scar on the Afrikaner psyche.
*   **Nationalism:** The shared trauma unified the Boers into a distinct nation (Afrikaners) defined by their victimization by an imperial power.
*   **Politics:** This resentment was the fuel for the National Party, which swept to power in 1948. The architects of **Apartheid** viewed their oppressive policies as a defensive measure to ensure the survival of the Afrikaner people, fearing another "genocide."
*   **Total War:** For the world, it marked the grim beginning of the 20th-century trend where civilians became the primary targets of "Total War."
