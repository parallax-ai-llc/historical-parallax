## Summary

Alfred Wegener was a German meteorologist and geophysicist who proposed the theory of continental drift in 1912. He suggested that the continents were once joined in a supercontinent he called Pangaea and have since drifted apart. His theory was initially rejected by most scientists but was vindicated in the 1960s with the discovery of plate tectonics. Wegener died during an expedition to Greenland.
