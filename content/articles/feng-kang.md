## Summary

Feng Kang was a Chinese mathematician who independently developed the finite element method in 1965, around the same time as Western mathematicians. His method for solving partial differential equations became fundamental to engineering simulation and computational science. He also developed symplectic algorithms for Hamiltonian systems. He is considered the father of Chinese computational mathematics.
