## Summary

Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858-1947) was a German theoretical physicist who revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes by originating quantum theory, one of the most fundamental frameworks of modern physics.[^1][^2] His discovery of energy quanta and the fundamental constant that bears his name—Planck's constant—earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.[^3][^4] Despite living through two world wars and enduring profound personal tragedies, including the execution of his son by the Nazi regime, Planck remained one of the most influential scientific figures of the twentieth century.[^5][^6] His legacy extends beyond his groundbreaking research to include his leadership of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society and his role as a bridge between classical and modern physics.[^7][^8]

## Early Life and Background

Max Planck was born on April 23, 1858, in Kiel, Holstein, to Johann Julius Wilhelm Planck and his second wife, Emma Patzig.[^9][^10] He came from a distinguished intellectual family with a long tradition of scholarship and service: his paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were both theology professors in Göttingen, while his father served as a law professor at the University of Kiel and later at Munich.[^11][^12] Planck was the sixth child in the family, though two of his siblings were from his father's first marriage.[^13] The family's long tradition of devotion to church and state, excellence in scholarship, incorruptibility, conservatism, idealism, reliability, and generosity became deeply ingrained in Planck's character and would shape his entire life and career.[^14]

Among young Planck's earliest memories was witnessing the marching of Prussian and Austrian troops into Kiel during the Second Schleswig War in 1864.[^15] In 1867, when Planck was nine years old, the family moved to Munich, where he enrolled at the Maximiliansgymnasium, a distinguished secondary school.[^16] It was there that his exceptional mathematical talents first emerged under the tutelage of Hermann Müller, a gifted mathematician who took special interest in the young student.[^17] Müller taught him astronomy, mechanics, and mathematics, and it was from this influential teacher that Planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy—a concept that would prove foundational to his later revolutionary work.[^18] Planck graduated early from gymnasium at the remarkably young age of seventeen.[^19]

Planck was extraordinarily gifted in music; he took singing lessons and played piano, organ, and cello with considerable skill, and even composed songs and operas.[^20] He seriously considered pursuing music as a career, and a music professor told him he had talent. However, Planck ultimately chose to study physics instead, believing that he could make more significant contributions to human knowledge through science.[^21] This decision, though it meant setting aside a potential musical career, proved momentous for the future of physics. In 1874, at age sixteen, Planck enrolled at the University of Munich, where he studied under Professor Philipp von Jolly.[^22][^23] Under Jolly's supervision, Planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the diffusion of hydrogen through heated platinum, but soon transferred his focus to theoretical physics.[^24]

During the academic year 1877-78, Planck spent time at the University of Berlin, where he attended lectures by the eminent physicists Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav Robert Kirchhoff.[^25] Surprisingly, despite their eminence as research scientists, Planck found their lectures uninspiring and was unimpressed by their teaching.[^26] He found Helmholtz's lectures poorly prepared and Kirchhoff's dry and monotonous.[^27] Returning to Munich, Planck pursued his doctoral studies independently, relying primarily on his own reading and research. In July 1879—the same year Einstein was born—Planck received his doctoral degree at the unusually young age of twenty-one with a dissertation on the second law of thermodynamics.[^28][^29] His early fascination with thermodynamics, particularly the concept of entropy and the second law, would remain central to his thinking throughout his career and would ultimately lead him to his quantum breakthrough.[^30]

## Rise to Prominence

After completing his doctorate, Planck continued his academic ascent during the 1880s, a period when he deepened his engagement with thermodynamics and began to establish his reputation within the German physics community.[^31] In April 1885, upon his appointment as Associate Professor at the University of Kiel, Planck married Marie Merck, a childhood friend and the sister of a school fellow.[^32][^33] The couple would have four children together before Marie's death in 1909, possibly from tuberculosis.[^34] This marriage marked the beginning of a stable domestic life that would support Planck's intense intellectual work over the following decades.

Planck's earliest professional work focused on thermodynamics, an interest he had acquired from his studies under Kirchhoff and from reading Rudolf Clausius's influential writings on the subject.[^35][^36] As a student, the first law of thermodynamics had deeply impressed Planck, and during his university years he became equally convinced that the entropy law—the second law of thermodynamics—was an absolute law of nature.[^37] This conviction would shape his research program for years, though it would also later prove to be an obstacle that he would have to overcome to make his quantum breakthrough.[^38]

In 1889, Planck's career took a major step forward when he succeeded his former professor Gustav Kirchhoff as Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Berlin, the most prestigious physics position in Germany.[^39][^40] He would remain at Berlin for the rest of his academic career. The appointment placed him at the center of German physics at a time when Germany was the world's leading scientific nation. He served as chairman of the German Physical Society from 1905 to 1908 and again from 1915 to 1916, positions that enhanced his influence and visibility in the physics community.[^41][^42]

The Planck household in Berlin became a renowned social and cultural center where science, music, and intellectual discourse flourished.[^43] The family regularly hosted gatherings that attracted numerous well-known scientists, including Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn, and Lise Meitner, who became frequent visitors.[^44] Music played an important role in these social evenings, with Planck often performing at the piano while Einstein accompanied him on violin.[^45] These gatherings fostered the kind of informal scientific exchange that would prove crucial to the development of modern physics in the early twentieth century. Planck also maintained his lifelong passion for mountain climbing and regularly hiked through many parts of the Alps on vacations with his family or friends, finding in the mountains both physical challenge and spiritual renewal.[^46]

## Major Achievements

Max Planck's fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, which revolutionized our understanding of atomic and subatomic processes just as Albert Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space and time.[^47][^48] Together, these two frameworks constitute the fundamental theories of twentieth-century physics.[^49] Planck's path to this revolutionary discovery began with his work on a seemingly technical problem: the nature of black-body radiation.

At the end of the nineteenth century, physicists were unable to explain why the observed spectrum of black-body radiation—the electromagnetic radiation emitted by objects due to their temperature—diverged significantly at higher frequencies from that predicted by existing classical theories.[^50][^51] By September 1900, experimental physicists had proven beyond a doubt that the Wien-Planck law, which worked well at short wavelengths, failed at longer wavelengths.[^52] On October 7, 1900, Planck's friend Heinrich Rubens informed him of new experimental results, and Planck quickly worked to find the correct formula.[^53] Within days, by combining equations derived by Wilhelm Wien and Lord Rayleigh, Planck announced on October 19, 1900, a result now known as Planck's radiation formula.[^54][^55]

However, finding an empirical formula was not enough for Planck; he needed a theoretical derivation. Over the next two months, he worked to explain why his formula worked, and this effort led him to one of the most revolutionary ideas in the history of science.[^56] On December 14, 1900, Planck presented a groundbreaking paper to the German Physical Society in Berlin.[^57][^58] This occasion, on which Planck set forth the tenets of quantum theory, is now considered the birth of modern quantum physics.[^59] The central assumption behind his new derivation was what became known as the Planck postulate: that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in quantized form, in discrete packets rather than continuously.[^60][^61]

To achieve his goal, Planck found that he had to relinquish one of his own most cherished beliefs: that the second law of thermodynamics was an absolute law of nature.[^62] Instead, in what Planck himself called "an act of desperation," he had to embrace Ludwig Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law and adopt Boltzmann's atomic methods, despite his earlier skepticism about such approaches.[^63][^64] The revolutionary element in Planck's work was his introduction of a new fundamental constant, now called Planck's constant (h), which relates the energy of a quantum to the frequency of the associated electromagnetic wave.[^65][^66] His value for this constant was 6.55 × 10⁻²⁷ erg-second, remarkably close to the modern value of 6.626 × 10⁻²⁷ erg-second.[^67]

The discovery of Planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units—now called Planck units—all based on fundamental physical constants, including the Planck length and the Planck mass.[^68][^69] These units are expressed only in terms of physical constants and have become foundational for theoretical physics, particularly in attempts to understand quantum gravity and the fundamental structure of spacetime.[^70] With his later formulation of the third law of thermodynamics, Planck gave entropy a specific and definite value, which—to his own surprise—was closely related to the action quantum h.[^71]

The importance of Planck's discovery, with its far-reaching effect on classical physics, was not appreciated immediately.[^72] During the first few years of the twentieth century, while Planck's radiation law was quickly accepted because it matched experimental data, its basis in energy quantization was scarcely noticed, and no one initially considered his results to conflict with classical physics.[^73][^74] If a revolution occurred in physics in December 1900, as historians later claimed, nobody seemed to notice it at the time; Planck himself was no exception, and the importance later ascribed to his work is largely a historical reconstruction.[^75][^76]

However, the evidence for the validity of quantum theory gradually became overwhelming as its application accounted for many discrepancies between observed phenomena and classical theory.[^77] In recognition of Planck's fundamental contribution to this new branch of physics, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1918 "in recognition of the services he rendered to the advancement of Physics by his discovery of energy quanta."[^78][^79] Planck actually received his Nobel Prize in 1919, one year later than the award date, because the Nobel Committee for Physics decided in 1918 that none of that year's nominations met the criteria outlined in Alfred Nobel's will.[^80]

Planck's ideas not only revolutionized physics but also laid the foundation for modern technology, including the development of semiconductors, lasers, quantum computing, advanced materials, electronics, and cryptography.[^81][^82][^83] His work was pivotal in the development of modern physics and directly influenced the research of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and essentially every physicist who followed.[^84][^85] Einstein, in particular, was inspired by Planck's quantum hypothesis and used it in 1905 to explain the photoelectric effect, proposing that light itself consists of discrete quanta—later called photons.[^86][^87] Niels Bohr built upon Planck's ideas to develop his model of the atom that incorporated quantum principles, creating the foundation for quantum mechanics.[^88][^89]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Max Planck's position during the Nazi era remains one of the most controversial and debated aspects of his legacy, raising profound questions about the moral responsibilities of scientists under authoritarian regimes.[^90][^91] When the Nazis came to power in 1933, Planck was serving as president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, Germany's premier scientific research organization, having taken office in 1930 at the age of seventy-two.[^92][^93] He found himself in an impossible position: trying to preserve German science while navigating the brutal racial policies and political demands of the Third Reich.[^94]

In May 1933, Planck took the extraordinary step of meeting personally with Adolf Hitler in an attempt to protest the dismissal of Jewish scientists.[^95][^96] During this audience, Planck told Hitler that "the forced emigration of Jews would kill German science" and argued that "Jews could be good Germans."[^97] Hitler reacted with fury, dismissing Planck's concerns and working himself into such a rage that Planck had no choice but to leave.[^98] Despite this failed intervention, Planck managed to secure exemptions for several Jewish scientists, especially at the Prussian Academy and institutes where he had direct authority.[^99][^100]

However, Planck's resistance had clear limits. Under the Nazi racial laws, Planck dismissed a number of academy members who were Jewish, following the legal requirements imposed by the regime.[^101][^102] While Planck was never a member of the Nazi Party and personally opposed its ideology, he never openly defied its cruel and discriminatory laws.[^103][^104] Under Planck's leadership, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society avoided open conflict with the Nazi regime, with the notable exception of his efforts to protect Fritz Haber, the Jewish chemist who had directed the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry.[^105][^106] Critics have argued that Planck could have done more, perhaps by resigning his position in protest or by speaking out more forcefully against the regime's policies.[^107]

Freeman Dyson, in his essay "Max Planck: The Tragic Choices," noted that Planck occupied an uncomfortable middle ground—he was neither a Nazi collaborator nor a true resister, but rather someone who tried to work within a morally corrupted system while preserving what he could of German science.[^108] Some historians have characterized Planck as "the most ill-treated (non-Jewish) scientist in Nazi Germany," noting the severe personal costs he paid for his limited resistance.[^109] In 2001, the Max Planck Society—successor to the Kaiser Wilhelm Society—issued a formal apology when president Hubert Markl expressed "the deepest regret, compassion, and shame at the fact that crimes of this sort were committed, promoted, and not prevented within the ranks of German scientists."[^110][^111] Markl acknowledged that scientific evidence proved directors and employees at Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes "co-masterminded and sometimes even actively participated in the crimes of the Nazi regime."[^112]

On the scientific front, Planck also faced criticisms during his career. Ludwig Boltzmann, who was "better than anyone else" positioned to evaluate Planck's early work on irreversibility, identified flaws in Planck's reasoning about the second law of thermodynamics.[^113] Between 1907 and 1908, the Russian physicist Leonid Mandelstam attacked Planck's theory of dispersion published in 1904, leading to a heated polemic.[^114] In Soviet scientific literature, Mandelstam's position was long considered correct, though after the Soviet Union's collapse, Russian physicists came to treat Planck's position as correct.[^115]

Perhaps the most significant historical criticism came from philosopher and historian of science Thomas S. Kuhn, whose 1978 work "Black-Body Theory and the Quantum Discontinuity" provided a detailed revisionist account of Planck's contribution.[^116] Kuhn argued that Planck could not possibly have intended such a far-reaching revolutionary step as is usually attributed to him, and that quantum discontinuity did not actually play a key role in Planck's thinking about black-body radiation through the crucial period of 1900-1910.[^117][^118] According to Kuhn's interpretation, the revolutionary significance of Planck's work was largely a retrospective construction by later physicists and historians.[^119]

Ironically, even Planck's greatest scientific achievement was bittersweet for him personally, as he remained deeply uncomfortable with the implications of quantum physics that were discerned by Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, and others.[^120] He has been called "the reluctant revolutionary" because he continued to hope that quantum theory would eventually be reconciled with classical physics and never fully accepted the radical probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics that emerged in the 1920s.[^121][^122] This conservatism, while understandable given his background and temperament, meant that Planck himself did not follow through on the full implications of his own revolutionary discovery.[^123]

## Personal Life

Max Planck's personal life was marked by profound devotion to family, deep cultural interests, and ultimately devastating tragedies that would have broken most people.[^124] In March 1887, following his appointment as Associate Professor at Kiel, Planck married Marie Merck, the daughter of a Munich banker and a childhood friend.[^125][^126] Their marriage produced four children: Karl, twins Emma and Margarete (Grete), and Erwin.[^127] Marie Planck died in July 1909, possibly from tuberculosis, after twenty-two years of marriage.[^128][^129] Her death was a severe blow to Planck, who had depended greatly on her support during his most productive research years.

In March 1911, Planck married his second wife, Marga von Hoesslin, who was significantly younger than him—she was born in 1882, making her twenty-four years his junior.[^130][^131] In December of that same year, their son Hermann was born, giving Planck five children in total.[^132] The Planck home in Berlin became renowned as a social and cultural center where numerous well-known scientists, including Albert Einstein, Otto Hahn, and Lise Meitner, gathered regularly.[^133][^134] These gatherings combined scientific discussion with musical performance, reflecting Planck's deep commitment to both domains.[^135]

Music remained a central passion throughout Planck's life. He was genuinely gifted: he took singing lessons and played piano, organ, and cello with considerable skill, and composed songs and operas.[^136][^137] Einstein, who was himself an accomplished amateur violinist, often joined Planck for musical evenings, with Planck at the piano and Einstein on violin.[^138] Planck also maintained a lifelong passion for mountain climbing and regularly hiked through many parts of the Alps during vacations with family or friends, finding in these excursions both physical challenge and spiritual renewal.[^139][^140]

However, Planck's personal life was devastated by an almost unbearable series of tragedies, particularly during and after the world wars.[^141] During World War I, his son Karl was killed in action at Verdun in 1916.[^142][^143] His second son, Erwin, was taken prisoner by the French in 1914 and spent years in captivity.[^144] Even more heartbreaking, both of Planck's twin daughters died in childbirth—Margarete in 1917 and Emma in 1919.[^145][^146] The loss of three of his children within just three years was a crushing blow that Planck bore with stoic dignity, continuing his scientific work even as his personal world collapsed.[^147]

The tragedies continued into Planck's old age. In February 1944, during World War II, his home in Berlin was completely destroyed by an Allied air raid, and all his personal papers and scientific records were lost forever.[^148][^149] Far worse was to come: his youngest son Erwin became implicated in the infamous July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler.[^150][^151] Despite desperate efforts by the elderly Planck to intercede for his son, Erwin was arrested by the Gestapo and, after months of brutal interrogation and torture, was executed by hanging in January 1945.[^152][^153] Planck, then eighty-six years old, was devastated by this final, most terrible loss. The execution of Erwin—who had not been a Nazi supporter—represented the ultimate price that Planck paid for living through Germany's darkest era.[^154]

## Legacy

Max Planck's legacy extends far beyond his specific scientific discoveries to encompass his fundamental role in creating the conceptual framework of modern physics.[^155] As one historian noted, Planck's fame rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, which together with Einstein's relativity theory constitutes one of the two pillars upon which twentieth-century physics was built.[^156][^157] The revolutionary theory that Planck inaugurated has shaped our understanding of the atomic and subatomic world and has proven indispensable to virtually every major advance in physics over the past century.[^158]

Planck's constant (h), which he introduced in 1900, has proven to be one of the most fundamental constants in all of nature, as important as the speed of light or the gravitational constant.[^159][^160] It appears in virtually every equation of quantum mechanics and sets the scale at which quantum effects become important.[^161] The Planck units that he derived from this constant—including the Planck length (approximately 1.6 × 10⁻³⁵ meters) and the Planck time (approximately 5.4 × 10⁻⁴⁴ seconds)—define the scales at which our current theories of physics break down and where a complete theory of quantum gravity will be needed.[^162][^163] These units remain central to theoretical physics research today, particularly in string theory and other attempts to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity.[^164]

The technological impact of quantum theory, which Planck initiated, can scarcely be overstated.[^165] His ideas laid the foundation for modern technology, including the development of semiconductors that power all modern electronics, lasers used in everything from surgery to telecommunications, quantum computing which promises to revolutionize information processing, advanced materials with precisely engineered properties, modern cryptography, and countless other applications.[^166][^167][^168] It is no exaggeration to say that the modern technological world would be impossible without the quantum theory that Planck began.[^169]

Planck's influence on other scientists was equally profound. His work was pivotal in shaping the research of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Erwin Schrödinger, and essentially the entire generation of physicists who developed quantum mechanics in the 1920s.[^170][^171] Einstein was particularly influenced by Planck's quantum hypothesis and used it to explain the photoelectric effect in 1905, for which Einstein himself would later receive the Nobel Prize.[^172][^173] Bohr built upon Planck's ideas to develop his quantum model of the atom, which became the foundation for understanding atomic structure.[^174][^175] The relationship between Planck and Einstein was especially significant: Planck was one of the first prominent physicists to recognize the importance of Einstein's special theory of relativity in 1905, and he actively promoted relativity theory in Germany, helping Einstein gain the recognition he deserved.[^176][^177]

Planck's institutional legacy also remains significant. In 1948, one year after Planck's death, the Kaiser Wilhelm Society—which Planck had led during the difficult years of 1930-1937—was renamed the Max Planck Society (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft) in his honor.[^178][^179] Today, the Max Planck Society is one of the most prestigious and successful scientific research organizations in the world, operating 83 institutes across Germany and representing a wide range of scientific disciplines.[^180][^181] These institutes conduct cutting-edge research and have produced numerous Nobel laureates, continuing Planck's tradition of scientific excellence.[^182]

Planck is remembered not only for his scientific achievements but also for his personal qualities: his integrity, his devotion to truth, his stoic endurance of terrible personal tragedies, and his attempts—however limited—to preserve scientific values during the Nazi period.[^183] His life exemplified both the heights of intellectual achievement and the depths of human suffering, making him a profoundly human figure as well as a scientific giant.[^184] The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, launched in 2009 to study the cosmic microwave background radiation, was named in his honor, ensuring that his name remains associated with fundamental discoveries about the universe.[^185]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and scientists have consistently recognized Max Planck as one of the most important physicists in history and a true revolutionary figure, even if he himself was reluctant to embrace the full implications of his discoveries.[^186] The Nobel Committee's decision to award him the 1918 Physics Prize reflected the growing recognition that Planck had fundamentally transformed physics, and the official citation praised him "for his work on the establishment and development of the theory of elementary quanta."[^187][^188] Modern physics textbooks universally acknowledge Planck as the founder of quantum theory, and December 14, 1900—the date of his groundbreaking presentation—is widely celebrated as the birthday of quantum physics.[^189][^190]

Albert Einstein, who understood Planck's achievement better than perhaps anyone, was among his most important champions. Einstein recognized that Planck's discovery of energy quanta required "a rewriting of the laws of physics" and built extensively on Planck's work throughout his career.[^191][^192] The two men shared a profound and mutually respectful professional relationship that significantly influenced the course of modern physics, marked by both rigorous debate and deep friendship.[^193][^194] As physicist Freeman Dyson noted, while other scientists contributed to quantum theory's development, Planck deserves unique recognition for taking the crucial first step into unknown territory.[^195]

Historians of science have praised Planck's combination of mathematical rigor, physical insight, and philosophical depth. His work on thermodynamics before his quantum breakthrough demonstrated his mastery of classical physics, making his revolutionary contribution all the more significant—he knew exactly what he was overthrowing.[^196][^197] The fact that Planck was deeply conservative in his scientific philosophy, preferring to preserve classical physics if at all possible, actually strengthens the case for the revolutionary nature of his discovery: even he could not avoid the quantum conclusion once he seriously engaged with the black-body radiation data.[^198][^199]

Admirers also point to Planck's moral courage and personal integrity, particularly his attempts to defend Jewish scientists after 1933 and his refusal to join the Nazi Party despite considerable pressure.[^200][^201] While acknowledging the limitations of his resistance, many scholars argue that Planck did what he could within an impossible situation, and that his son's ultimate sacrifice in the plot to kill Hitler demonstrates the Planck family's opposition to the regime.[^202][^203] His stoic endurance of overwhelming personal tragedy—losing four of his five children—while continuing to contribute to science and to lead German scientific institutions, has earned him considerable sympathy and respect.[^204][^205]

### Negative Views

Critics of Planck have focused primarily on his accommodation with the Nazi regime and his scientific conservatism. The most serious criticisms concern his leadership of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society during the Nazi era.[^206] While Planck personally opposed Nazi ideology and made some attempts to protect Jewish scientists, he ultimately complied with the regime's racial laws and presided over the dismissal of 126 staff members, 104 of them scientists.[^207][^208] The 2001 apology by the Max Planck Society acknowledged that under the organization's leadership—including Planck's tenure—some institutes "co-masterminded and sometimes even actively participated in the crimes of the Nazi regime."[^209][^210]

Critics argue that Planck should have resigned his position in protest rather than lending his prestige to a criminal regime, even if his intentions were to preserve what he could of German science.[^211] His meeting with Hitler in 1933, while demonstrating personal courage, was ultimately ineffective and perhaps even counterproductive, as it may have given the appearance of engagement with the regime.[^212] Some scholars contend that Planck's conservatism and devotion to traditional German values of duty and service to the state blinded him to the full moral enormity of Nazism and prevented him from taking more decisive action.[^213]

On scientific grounds, historians like Thomas Kuhn have challenged the traditional narrative of Planck as a revolutionary who consciously introduced quantum discontinuity.[^214] Kuhn argued that Planck himself did not initially recognize the revolutionary implications of his work and that the importance later attributed to his December 1900 paper was largely a retrospective construction.[^215][^216] According to this interpretation, Planck was trying to solve a technical problem within classical physics, and the quantum revolution was more the work of Einstein, Bohr, and others who recognized the radical implications that Planck himself resisted.[^217]

Indeed, Planck's scientific conservatism is well documented. He remained uncomfortable with the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics developed in the 1920s and hoped until late in his life that quantum theory could somehow be reconciled with classical determinism.[^218][^219] This has led some to characterize him as "the reluctant revolutionary"—someone who made a revolutionary discovery almost against his will and never fully embraced the implications of his own work.[^220][^221] His resistance to the full quantum worldview meant that younger physicists like Heisenberg, Born, and Schrödinger, rather than Planck himself, developed the complete theory of quantum mechanics.[^222]

Some critics also point to controversies during Planck's career, such as his disputes with Boltzmann over statistical mechanics and with Mandelstam over dispersion theory, suggesting that Planck could be stubborn and slow to recognize the validity of approaches that differed from his own.[^223][^224] His initial resistance to Boltzmann's statistical interpretation of thermodynamics, which he later had to adopt to derive his quantum formula, is sometimes cited as evidence of his philosophical rigidity.[^225]
