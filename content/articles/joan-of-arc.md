## Summary

Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc, c. 1412-1431) was a French peasant girl who, claiming divine guidance, led the French army to several pivotal victories during the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) against England. At age 17, she convinced the uncrowned King Charles VII to let her lead troops to break the English siege of Orléans—a turning point that revitalized French morale and led to Charles's coronation at Reims. Captured by Burgundian allies of England, she was tried for heresy by a pro-English church court and burned at the stake at age 19. Nullified 25 years later, Joan was canonized as a Catholic saint in 1920. She remains one of history's most remarkable figures—a teenage girl who changed the course of a war and became an enduring symbol of French nationalism, faith, and female courage.
