## Summary

Amedeo Avogadro was an Italian scientist known for his contribution to molecular theory, now known as Avogadro's law. He proposed that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. The Avogadro constant (approximately 6.022×10²³), named in his honor, is one of the most fundamental constants in chemistry. His ideas were largely ignored during his lifetime but later proved essential to atomic theory.
