## Summary

Anton Webern was an Austrian composer whose extremely concentrated, aphoristic works represent the most radical application of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. His entire output fits on about three hours of recordings, yet his influence on post-1945 music was enormous. Boulez, Stockhausen, and the Darmstadt school built on his innovations.
