## Summary

Fritz Zwicky was a Swiss-American astronomer and physicist who made important contributions to astrophysics and cosmology. He was the first to use the term 'dark matter' to describe the missing mass he observed in galaxy clusters. He also predicted neutron stars, proposed gravitational lensing, and cataloged galaxy clusters. Despite his many contributions, he was known for his difficult personality and feuds with colleagues.
