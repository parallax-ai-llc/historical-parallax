## Summary

Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) was one of the most influential leaders of the American women's suffrage movement and a pioneering advocate for women's rights in the 19th century. Born into a Quaker family with strong activist traditions, she dedicated her life to achieving voting rights for women and worked tirelessly alongside Elizabeth Cady Stanton to challenge legal and social barriers that restricted women's participation in public life[^1]. Her most famous act of civil disobedience occurred in 1872 when she illegally voted in the presidential election, leading to her arrest and trial—an event that brought national attention to the suffrage cause[^2]. Though she did not live to see the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920, her decades of organizing, lecturing, and lobbying laid the essential groundwork for women gaining the right to vote[^3]. Anthony's legacy extends beyond suffrage to encompass broader questions of gender equality, civil rights, and social justice that continue to resonate in contemporary American society[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Susan Brownell Anthony was born on February 15, 1820, in Adams, Massachusetts, the second of seven children born to Daniel Anthony and Lucy Read Anthony[^5]. Her father was a cotton mill owner and a Quaker with strong moral convictions who believed in the equality of all people regardless of race or gender[^6]. The Quaker tradition in which Susan was raised emphasized education for both boys and girls, individual conscience, and social activism—values that would profoundly shape her worldview[^7]. The Anthony household was a gathering place for abolitionists and social reformers, exposing young Susan to radical ideas about human rights and social justice from an early age[^8].

Anthony received an unusually extensive education for a girl of her era, attending a district school and later a boarding school near Philadelphia[^9]. When the local teacher refused to teach her long division because she was female, her father established a home school where Susan and her siblings received instruction from educated tutors[^10]. This early experience with gender discrimination left a lasting impression on Anthony and fueled her determination to challenge societal limitations on women[^11]. At age seventeen, she began teaching at a Quaker boarding school, embarking on a career in education that would span fifteen years[^12].

The economic panic of 1837 devastated her family's finances, forcing them to sell their property and possessions at auction[^13]. This experience gave Anthony firsthand insight into women's economic vulnerability, as her mother and sisters watched their personal belongings sold to pay her father's debts—property they had no legal right to retain under the laws of coverture that made married women legally invisible[^14]. The family relocated to a farm near Rochester, New York, where they became deeply involved in the abolitionist movement, hosting anti-slavery meetings at their home and providing refuge for fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad[^15]. These formative experiences with activism, education, and economic injustice would provide the foundation for Anthony's lifelong commitment to social reform[^16].

---

## Rise to Prominence

Anthony's path to becoming a national figure in the reform movements began with her involvement in the temperance cause in the late 1840s and early 1850s[^17]. As a teacher, she had witnessed the devastating effects of alcohol abuse on families and became convinced that women needed political power to address this social problem[^18]. However, when she attempted to speak at a Sons of Temperance meeting in 1852, she was told that "the sisters were not invited there to speak, but to listen and learn"[^19]. This humiliating experience crystallized her understanding that women's lack of political rights was the fundamental barrier to their ability to effect social change[^20].

The turning point in Anthony's life came in 1851 when she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who had organized the groundbreaking Seneca Falls Convention in 1848[^21]. The two women formed an extraordinarily productive partnership that would last fifty years, with Stanton providing much of the intellectual framework and rhetorical brilliance while Anthony contributed tireless organizational skills and strategic thinking[^22]. As Stanton later wrote, "I forged the thunderbolts, she fired them"[^23]. Together, they began organizing women's rights conventions, circulating petitions, and lobbying state legislators for reforms to property laws and women's legal status[^24].

In 1856, Anthony became an agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, delivering speeches throughout New York State despite facing hostile mobs who threw eggs, burned her in effigy, and threatened physical violence[^25]. This experience honed her skills as a public speaker and organizer while deepening her commitment to universal human rights[^26]. During the Civil War, she and Stanton founded the Women's Loyal National League, which collected nearly 400,000 signatures on petitions calling for the complete abolition of slavery—the largest petition drive in American history to that date[^27]. This demonstrated women's capacity for political organizing even without the vote and established Anthony as a formidable political operative[^28].

Following the Civil War, Anthony worked vigorously for the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, which granted citizenship and voting rights to formerly enslaved men[^29]. When these amendments failed to include women, Anthony felt betrayed by former abolitionist allies and broke with longtime colleagues like Frederick Douglass over the question of whether Black male suffrage should take precedence over universal suffrage[^30]. This bitter split marked a turning point in her career, as she shifted her focus exclusively to women's suffrage and began building a dedicated movement independent of other reform causes[^31].

## Major Achievements

Anthony's most significant achievement was her role in building the women's suffrage movement into a powerful national political force that would eventually achieve constitutional recognition of women's right to vote[^32]. In 1869, she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), which advocated for a federal constitutional amendment granting women the vote and pursued a broad agenda of women's rights reforms[^33]. For the next fifty years, Anthony served as the movement's chief organizer, traveling extensively to organize state campaigns, deliver lectures, and build grassroots support[^34].

Her most famous act of civil disobedience occurred on November 5, 1872, when she registered and voted in the presidential election in Rochester, New York[^35]. Two weeks later, she was arrested and charged with "knowingly, wrongfully and unlawfully voting for a representative to the Congress of the United States"[^36]. Her subsequent trial became a national spectacle and an important platform for publicizing the suffrage cause[^37]. Though the judge directed a guilty verdict and fined her $100, which she refused to pay, Anthony used her trial to deliver powerful arguments about women's constitutional right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment[^38]. The publicity generated by her arrest and trial brought unprecedented attention to the suffrage movement and inspired women across the country[^39].

Anthony played a crucial role in building the institutional infrastructure of the suffrage movement, including helping to launch and edit The Revolution, a weekly women's rights newspaper published from 1868 to 1870[^40]. The paper's masthead bore the motto "Men, their rights and nothing more; women, their rights and nothing less," capturing Anthony's uncompromising commitment to full equality[^41]. Though the paper ran into financial difficulties and ceased publication after two years, it provided an important platform for radical ideas about women's rights during a critical period[^42].

Between 1868 and 1870, Anthony traveled throughout the country, lecturing in twenty-one states and covering over 13,000 miles by train, stagecoach, and sleigh[^43]. She spoke in village halls, churches, and private homes, often facing hostile audiences but slowly building support for women's suffrage one convert at a time[^44]. Her organizational genius was evident in her meticulous record-keeping, strategic planning, and ability to mobilize volunteers for petition drives, lobbying campaigns, and state referendum efforts[^45].

In 1888, Anthony organized the International Council of Women, bringing together delegates from forty-nine women's organizations in the United States and eight foreign countries[^46]. This marked the beginning of the international women's movement and demonstrated the global reach of the ideas Anthony championed[^47]. Two years later, she successfully negotiated the merger of the National Woman Suffrage Association with the more conservative American Woman Suffrage Association, creating the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) with Anthony serving as vice president and later president[^48].

Anthony compiled and edited the first four volumes of the monumental History of Woman Suffrage (1881-1902), a comprehensive documentary record of the movement that ensured future generations would have access to the speeches, letters, and records of the suffrage struggle[^49]. This six-volume work, completed after her death, remains an essential historical source for understanding the women's rights movement[^50]. Her work on this project reflected her deep awareness of the importance of controlling the historical narrative and preserving the movement's documentary record[^51].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her historic achievements, Anthony's legacy includes significant controversies that continue to generate scholarly debate and criticism[^52]. The most serious criticism concerns her response to the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which granted Black men the right to vote but excluded women[^53]. Feeling betrayed by former abolitionist allies who urged women to wait their turn, Anthony made statements that revealed racist attitudes and a willingness to exploit racial prejudice to advance women's suffrage[^54]. She argued that educated white women deserved the vote more than formerly enslaved Black men, and her newspaper The Revolution sometimes published articles expressing nativist and racist sentiments[^55].

In an 1869 speech, Anthony declared, "I will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work or demand the ballot for the Negro and not the woman"[^56]. She later advocated for strategies that appealed to white supremacist fears, arguing that women's suffrage would ensure "white supremacy" in the South by doubling the white vote[^57]. These tactical compromises with racism deeply compromised the universalist principles Anthony claimed to champion and alienated Black women activists like Ida B. Wells, who criticized the suffrage movement's exclusionary practices[^58]. Anthony's failure to challenge racial segregation at suffrage conventions and her willingness to sacrifice the concerns of Black women for political expediency represents a profound moral failure that tarnishes her legacy[^59].

Anthony's single-minded focus on suffrage also drew criticism from labor activists and socialists who argued that she ignored the economic dimensions of women's oppression[^60]. While she supported women's right to work and equal pay, Anthony opposed protective labor legislation for women workers and sometimes sided with employers against striking women workers[^61]. Critics charged that her middle-class perspective blinded her to the material conditions facing working-class women and that she prioritized legal equality over economic justice[^62].

Some contemporaries and later feminists criticized Anthony's personal rigidity and authoritarian leadership style within the suffrage movement[^63]. She could be domineering, unforgiving of those who disagreed with her, and intolerant of organizational rivals[^64]. Her decision to exclude Victoria Woodhull from the suffrage movement because of Woodhull's advocacy of free love and her unconventional personal life reflected a conservative respectability politics that some found hypocritical[^65]. Anthony's insistence on maintaining strict control over the movement and her resistance to newer, more militant tactics in her later years led some younger activists to view her as an obstacle to progress[^66].

Anthony's strategic alliance with Frances Willard and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, despite Willard's openly racist views and support for lynching, further demonstrated her willingness to overlook issues of racial justice when expedient for the suffrage cause[^67]. When Ida B. Wells confronted Anthony about this alliance in 1894, Anthony defended Willard and refused to condemn her racist statements, prioritizing movement unity over racial justice[^68]. This incident crystallized the tensions between white suffragists' narrow focus on gender oppression and Black women's intersectional understanding of how race and gender combine to create unique forms of oppression[^69].

## Personal Life

Susan B. Anthony never married, a choice that was both principled and strategic[^70]. She believed that marriage under the laws of her time made women legal subordinates to their husbands, and she refused to enter an institution she deemed fundamentally unjust[^71]. "I never felt I could give up my life of freedom to become a man's housekeeper," she explained, viewing marriage as incompatible with her commitment to public activism[^72]. Her decision to remain single allowed her unprecedented freedom to travel, speak, and organize without the domestic obligations that constrained married women's lives[^73].

Anthony's most important personal relationship was her partnership with Elizabeth Cady Stanton, which combined deep affection with remarkable intellectual and political synergy[^74]. The two women spent extensive time together, with Anthony often staying at Stanton's home for weeks or months, helping to care for her children while they collaborated on speeches and strategy[^75]. Their correspondence reveals a relationship of profound mutual respect and genuine love, though their different life circumstances—Stanton as a mother of seven, Anthony as a single career activist—sometimes created tensions[^76]. Stanton's daughter Harriot later recalled that Anthony was "like another mother" to the Stanton children[^77].

Despite her public image as stern and severe, those who knew Anthony personally described her as warm, affectionate, and possessed of a lively sense of humor[^78]. She maintained close friendships with a circle of women activists and enjoyed music, though she famously could not carry a tune herself[^79]. Anthony lived modestly, devoting most of her earnings from lectures to the suffrage cause and frequently depending on the hospitality of supporters during her travels[^80]. She spent her final years living with her sister Mary in Rochester, where she continued working on the History of Woman Suffrage and mentoring younger activists[^81].

Anthony's relationship with her family remained important throughout her life, particularly her bonds with her sisters Mary, Guelma, and Hannah, all of whom supported her activism[^82]. Her father's death in 1862 deeply affected her, as he had been her earliest supporter and inspiration[^83]. Anthony cared for her mother in her final years and maintained close ties with her siblings' children, serving as a beloved aunt to numerous nieces and nephews[^84]. Her personal papers reveal a woman who valued family connections even as her political commitments limited her ability to maintain conventional domestic relationships[^85].

## Legacy

Susan B. Anthony's legacy as a pioneering advocate for women's rights is secure, though contemporary assessments acknowledge both her monumental achievements and significant failures[^86]. Fourteen years after her death, the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified, granting women the right to vote—a victory that would have been impossible without the foundation she built through decades of organizing and advocacy[^87]. The amendment is often referred to as the "Susan B. Anthony Amendment" in recognition of her central role in the suffrage movement[^88].

In 1979, Anthony became the first woman to be depicted on U.S. currency when her image appeared on the dollar coin, though the coin never achieved widespread circulation[^89]. Numerous schools, buildings, and institutions bear her name, and her Rochester home became a National Historic Landmark[^90]. The National Susan B. Anthony Museum & House preserves her legacy and educates visitors about the suffrage movement[^91]. These commemorations reflect Anthony's status as an American icon and symbol of women's political empowerment[^92].

Anthony's influence extends far beyond the specific achievement of voting rights to encompass broader transformations in women's social, economic, and political status[^93]. Her insistence that women were entitled to full citizenship and equal participation in public life helped to fundamentally reshape American democracy[^94]. The arguments she developed about women's natural rights, constitutional equality, and human dignity continue to inform contemporary debates about gender equality and civil rights[^95].

However, Anthony's legacy must also be understood in the context of the suffrage movement's racial exclusions and compromises with white supremacy[^96]. Modern scholars emphasize the importance of recognizing how white suffragists like Anthony prioritized gender over race and sometimes actively participated in racist strategies that marginalized Black women and other women of color[^97]. This more critical assessment doesn't diminish Anthony's contributions but places them in a more complete historical context that acknowledges both her vision and her limitations[^98].

Contemporary feminists continue to grapple with Anthony's complex legacy, drawing inspiration from her courage and dedication while learning from her failures to build more inclusive and intersectional movements for justice[^99]. Her life demonstrates both the power of sustained activism to achieve transformative social change and the dangers of single-issue politics that fail to address interlocking systems of oppression[^100]. The ongoing work of achieving full equality for all women, particularly those marginalized by race, class, and other factors, represents the unfinished business of the movement Anthony helped to create[^101].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and scholars have long recognized Susan B. Anthony as one of the most consequential figures in American history, whose single-minded dedication to women's suffrage fundamentally transformed American democracy[^102]. Biographer Ida Husted Harper, who worked closely with Anthony in her final years, portrayed her as a heroic figure whose moral courage and strategic brilliance made possible advances in women's rights that once seemed impossible[^103]. Harper's authorized biography, while hagiographic in tone, documented Anthony's extraordinary organizational achievements and her ability to inspire others to join the cause[^104].

Modern scholars like Ellen Carol DuBois have emphasized Anthony's tactical genius in building a mass movement from the ground up, creating institutional structures that outlasted individual leaders, and maintaining focus on the strategic goal of suffrage even when it seemed politically unrealistic[^105]. DuBois argues that Anthony's insistence on women's right to vote as the foundation for all other reforms proved historically correct, as the Nineteenth Amendment opened doors to women's participation in politics and public life that produced cascading changes in women's status[^106].

Feminist historians have celebrated Anthony as a role model who demonstrated that women could live independent, meaningful lives outside of marriage and motherhood[^107]. Her personal example of a woman fully devoted to public activism challenged Victorian assumptions about women's proper sphere and expanded possibilities for future generations of women[^108]. Lynn Sherr's biography portrays Anthony as a complex, fully human figure whose flaws make her achievements more rather than less impressive[^109].

Anthony's defenders argue that her tactical compromises with racism, while morally problematic, must be understood in the context of her desperate efforts to achieve suffrage through any politically viable means[^110]. They note that she maintained personal relationships with Black activists like Frederick Douglass despite political disagreements and that her fundamental belief in universal human rights remained consistent even when her political strategies did not[^111]. Supporters emphasize that perfect ideological purity is rarely compatible with achieving concrete political change and that Anthony should be judged by the standards of effective political leadership rather than moral absolutism[^112].

Contemporary activists in the women's movement continue to draw inspiration from Anthony's example of lifelong commitment to a cause, her willingness to endure ridicule and persecution for her beliefs, and her strategic vision of building power through sustained organizing[^113]. The tools she developed—petition drives, lobbying campaigns, public speaking tours, and grassroots organizing—remain essential tactics in contemporary social movements[^114]. Her famous declaration that "failure is impossible" continues to inspire activists working for gender equality and social justice[^115].

### Negative Views

Critics of Susan B. Anthony, particularly scholars focused on race and intersectionality, argue that her legacy is fundamentally compromised by her racism and her willingness to build the women's suffrage movement on a foundation of white supremacy[^116]. Historian Bettina Aptheker has documented how white suffragists including Anthony deliberately excluded Black women from leadership positions, accepted racial segregation at suffrage conventions, and deployed racist arguments to appeal to white Southern voters[^117]. These were not merely tactical errors but constitutive features of a movement that conceptualized women's rights in racial terms[^118].

Kimberlé Crenshaw and other intersectional feminists point to Anthony's career as evidence of the dangers of single-issue politics that fail to recognize how different systems of oppression interact[^119]. By treating gender as separable from race and class, Anthony and her colleagues built a movement that primarily served the interests of white middle-class women while neglecting or actively harming women of color and working-class women[^120]. Critics argue that this myopic focus on voting rights, to the exclusion of economic justice and racial equality, created a version of feminism that was fundamentally limited and exclusionary[^121].

Some historians question whether Anthony's contributions have been overstated at the expense of other activists, particularly women of color whose work has been marginalized in dominant historical narratives[^122]. They note that activists like Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Mary Church Terrell, and Ida B. Wells developed more sophisticated analyses of how gender, race, and class intersect while maintaining commitments to multiple liberation struggles simultaneously[^123]. By centering Anthony's story, historians may inadvertently perpetuate the erasure of these more radical and inclusive voices[^124].

Labor historians have criticized Anthony's opposition to protective legislation for women workers and her sometimes antagonistic relationship with working-class women's organizing[^125]. Alice Kessler-Harris argues that Anthony's insistence on formal legal equality blinded her to the material conditions facing women workers who needed immediate protections against exploitation[^126]. Her alignment with employers against striking workers revealed the class biases of a movement dominated by middle-class reformers[^127].

Contemporary critics also challenge the celebratory narrative of suffrage as unqualified progress, noting that the Nineteenth Amendment failed to secure voting rights for many women of color who continued to face discrimination through poll taxes, literacy tests, and violence[^128]. The fact that Anthony and other white suffragists were willing to accept a version of suffrage that excluded Black women in Southern states reveals the limited nature of their commitment to universal rights[^129]. From this perspective, Anthony's legacy represents not the triumph of women's rights but the partial victory of white women's rights achieved through racial compromise[^130].
