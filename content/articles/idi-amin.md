## Summary

Idi Amin Dada Oumee (c. 1925 – August 16, 2003) was a Ugandan military officer who seized power in a 1971 coup and ruled Uganda as a brutal dictator until 1979. Known as the "Butcher of Uganda," Amin's eight-year reign of terror was characterized by mass killings, ethnic persecution, economic mismanagement, and bizarre personality cult. An estimated 100,000 to 500,000 people were killed under his regime, including political opponents, ethnic minorities, intellectuals, and religious leaders. His expulsion of Uganda's Asian population and aggressive foreign policy isolated the country internationally, leaving it economically devastated.
