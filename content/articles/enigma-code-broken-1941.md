## Overview

The breaking of the German Enigma code by Allied cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park was the greatest intelligence success of World War II. The Enigma machine, used by Nazis to encrypt all radio communications, was believed unbreakable (159 quintillion possible settings per day). A team of mathematicians, linguists, and puzzle solvers—led by genius Alan Turing—built the first electromechanical computers ("Bombe") to crack the daily keys. Known as "Ultra" intelligence, this secret advantage allowed Allies to win the Battle of the Atlantic, anticipate D-Day defenses, and defeat Rommel in Africa. It remained a secret until the 1970s.

## Background

### The Machine

**Enigma:**
Typewriter-like device with rotors. Press a letter -> electrical signal passes through rotors -> lights up different letter.
**Rotors:** Settings changed every day at midnight.
**Math:** 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 combinations.

### Polish Contribution

**Marian Rejewski:**
Polish mathematicians broke early Enigma in 1930s. Gave everything to British/French in 1939 before invasion.
Crucial head start.

## Bletchley Park

**Station X:**
Victorian mansion north of London. Top Secret "Government Code and Cypher School."
Staff: Professors, chess champions, crossword experts, Wrens (women's navy).

### Alan Turing

**The Genius:**
Father of computer science. Eccentric (chained mug to radiator).
Realized human intuition wasn't enough; needed a machine to defeat a machine.

**The Bombe:**
Electromechanical device designed by Turing and Gordon Welchman.
Simulated 36 Enigma machines running backwards. Could test settings rapidly to find the day's key.

## The Breakthroughs

### The Cribs

**"Heil Hitler":**
Germans often ended messages with predictable phrases. Turing used these "cribs" (known plaintext) to deduce settings.

### U-Boat Enigma (Triton)

**Naval Enigma:**
More complex (4 rotors). Hardest to break.
**Pinch:** Capturing codebooks from U-110 and U-559 essential.
**Impact:** Allowed convoys to steer around wolfpacks. Won Battle of Atlantic.

## Creating the Computer

**Colossus (1944):**
Tommy Flowers built world's first programmable electronic digital computer to break "Lorenz" (Hitler's personal teleprinter code). Precursor to modern age.

---

## Secrecy

**"Ultra":**
Classification above Top Secret.
Churchill: "The geese that laid the golden eggs but never cackled."
If Germans knew, they would change system.
**Dilemma:** Sometimes had to let ships sink or cities be bombed (Coventry myth) to protect the Secret.

## Legacy

### Impact on War

Eisenhower: "Decisive contribution to Allied victory."
Shortened war by estimated 2 years.

### Alan Turing's Tragedy

War hero.
Prosecuted for homosexuality (1952). Chemical castration.
Suicide 1954 (cyanide apple).
Royal Pardon 2013.
