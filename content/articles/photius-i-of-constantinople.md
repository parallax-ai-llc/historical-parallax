## Summary

Photius I was the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople who was one of the most learned men of the Middle Ages. He compiled the Bibliotheca, an invaluable collection of reviews and summaries of classical and Christian books. His dispute with Pope Nicholas I over jurisdiction and the Filioque clause contributed to the Great Schism between East and West. He is venerated as a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church.
