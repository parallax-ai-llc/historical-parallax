## Summary

Desiderius Erasmus was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and theologian who played a major role in reforming the Catholic Church from within. His Greek New Testament became the basis for later translations including Luther's German Bible and the King James Version. His satirical work 'In Praise of Folly' criticized Church corruption. He advocated reform but opposed the Protestant break with Rome.
