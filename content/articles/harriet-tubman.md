## Summary

Harriet Tubman (c. 1822–1913) was born into slavery in Maryland and became one of America's most renowned abolitionists and freedom fighters.[^1] After escaping slavery in 1849, she made approximately 13 missions back to the South, leading around 70 enslaved people to freedom through the Underground Railroad network.[^2] During the Civil War, she served the Union Army as a scout, spy, and nurse, becoming the first woman to lead an armed military operation in United States history.[^3] In her later years, she became an activist for women's suffrage and established a home for elderly African Americans.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Harriet Tubman was born Araminta "Minty" Ross around March 1822 in Dorchester County, Maryland, on the plantation of Anthony Thompson in an area called Peter's Neck.[^5] She was the fifth of nine children born to Benjamin "Ben" Ross and Harriet "Rit" Greene Ross, both of whom were enslaved.[^6] Her siblings included Linah, Mariah Ritty, Soph, Rachel, Robert, Ben, Henry, and Moses.[^7] The family endured the constant threat of separation, and Edward Brodess, who owned Araminta and her mother, sold three of her sisters—Linah, Soph, and Mariah Ritty—whom she never saw again.[^8]

From the age of five or six, Tubman was hired out to other slaveholders, beginning her life of brutal labor.[^9] Her early assignments included working as a house servant, caring for an infant, checking muskrat traps in icy waters, and later performing field work, driving oxen, plowing, and hauling logs.[^10] She was frequently beaten and whipped by her enslavers, enduring severe physical and psychological abuse throughout her childhood.[^11]

At approximately age thirteen, Tubman suffered a life-altering injury that would affect her for the rest of her life.[^12] While in a Bucktown Village store, she refused to help an overseer capture a runaway slave.[^13] In retaliation, the enraged overseer threw a two-pound metal weight at the fleeing slave, but it struck Tubman in the head instead.[^14] The blow fractured her skull and left her unconscious.[^15] She nearly died from the injury and suffered intermittent epileptic seizures, severe headaches, narcoleptic episodes, and vivid dreams for the remainder of her life.[^16] Despite medical advice to her owner that her skull should be opened to relieve pressure, no such operation was performed.[^17]

During her teenage years, Tubman began to exhibit the fierce independence and spiritual conviction that would define her later activism.[^18] She experienced intense religious visions and dreams, which she interpreted as divine revelations and guidance.[^19] In 1844, at the age of 22, she married John Tubman, a free Black man.[^20] Upon marriage, she changed her first name from Araminta to Harriet, adopting her mother's name, and took her husband's surname, becoming known as Harriet Tubman.[^21] Little is known about their relationship, though it appears John was content with his status in Maryland and did not share Harriet's burning desire for freedom.[^22]

Despite being married to a free man, Tubman remained enslaved and lived under the constant threat of being sold.[^23] When Edward Brodess died in 1849, rumors circulated that his widow planned to sell slaves to settle the estate's debts, placing Tubman and her family in immediate danger.[^24] This threat catalyzed Tubman's decision to escape, setting in motion one of the most remarkable stories of resistance and liberation in American history.[^25]

## Rise to Power

Harriet Tubman's rise from escaped slave to legendary conductor of the Underground Railroad represents one of the most extraordinary journeys in American history. In September 1849, fearing imminent sale to the Deep South, Tubman made the courageous decision to escape.[^26] She initially fled with her two brothers, Ben and Henry, but they grew fearful and insisted on returning.[^27] Tubman refused to turn back and continued alone, traveling approximately 90 miles through hostile territory to reach Philadelphia and freedom.[^28]

Upon reaching Pennsylvania, Tubman later recalled: "I had crossed the line. I was free; but there was no one to welcome me to the land of freedom. I was a stranger in a strange land."[^29] However, her freedom felt incomplete without her family.[^30] Rather than settling into a safe life in the North, Tubman made the extraordinary decision to return to the South to rescue her family and other enslaved people.[^31]

Between 1850 and 1860, Tubman made approximately 13 dangerous trips back to Maryland and other slave states.[^32] Operating primarily in the winter months when long nights provided cover, she used the Underground Railroad network of safe houses, secret routes, and antislavery activists to guide approximately 70 people to freedom.[^33] Her passengers included her parents, several siblings, nieces, nephews, and other enslaved individuals.[^34] She employed ingenious tactics: traveling on Saturday nights (when newspapers wouldn't print runaway notices until Monday), using coded songs and signals, carrying a pistol for protection and to discourage passengers from turning back, and leveraging her intimate knowledge of Maryland's landscape.[^35]

Tubman earned the biblical sobriquet "Moses" for leading her people out of bondage.[^36] Slave owners in Maryland posted rewards totaling $40,000 for her capture (equivalent to over $1 million today).[^37] Despite the enormous risks and bounties on her head, Tubman famously declared: "I was the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say; I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger."[^38]

Her reputation grew within abolitionist circles in the North.[^39] She became acquainted with leading abolitionists including Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and John Brown.[^40] In April 1858, she met Brown in Canada, where he outlined his plan for an armed uprising to end slavery.[^41] Brown called her "General Tubman" and "one of the baddest and best persons on this continent."[^42] She helped him recruit supporters for his raid on Harpers Ferry, though illness prevented her from participating in the October 1859 attack.[^43]

By 1859, Tubman had purchased a home in Auburn, New York, from antislavery politician William H. Seward, establishing a permanent base for herself and her family.[^44] In December 1860, she conducted her last rescue mission, bringing seven people to freedom in Canada.[^45] When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Tubman's skills, courage, and knowledge made her an invaluable asset to the Union cause, opening a new chapter in her fight for freedom.[^46]

## Major Achievements

Harriet Tubman's achievements span three distinct but interconnected arenas: the Underground Railroad, military service during the Civil War, and humanitarian and suffragist activism. Each domain reveals her extraordinary courage, strategic brilliance, and unwavering commitment to freedom and justice.

### Underground Railroad Operations

Tubman's work as a conductor on the Underground Railroad stands as her most celebrated achievement. Between 1850 and 1860, she personally led approximately 70 enslaved people to freedom through about 13 perilous journeys into slave territory.[^47] While some accounts claim she rescued 300 people, modern scholarship establishes 70 as the more accurate figure based on historical documentation.[^48] Nevertheless, her success rate was unprecedented—she never lost a single passenger.[^49]

Her methods combined meticulous planning with improvisation and deception.[^50] She carried a pistol to defend against slave catchers and to discourage frightened fugitives from turning back, understanding that one person's capture could jeopardize the entire network.[^51] She used her religious faith as both spiritual comfort and practical tool, singing coded spirituals like "Wade in the Water" to communicate warnings.[^52] Tubman's intelligence network among enslaved and free Black communities provided crucial information about safe routes and dangers.[^53]

Beyond her personal rescue missions, Tubman gave instructions to dozens of other enslaved people who found their way to freedom using her advice and routes.[^54] Her work inspired countless others and struck fear into slaveholders throughout Maryland and Virginia.[^55]

### Civil War Service

When the Civil War began in 1861, Tubman enlisted with the Union Army and traveled to South Carolina, where she served in multiple capacities.[^56] Initially working as a nurse treating wounded soldiers and formerly enslaved people suffering from dysentery and other diseases, she used her knowledge of herbal remedies learned in Maryland to cure patients when conventional medicine failed.[^57]

More significantly, Tubman served as a scout and spy for the Union forces.[^58] Her ability to gather intelligence from enslaved people in Confederate territory proved invaluable.[^59] Working under Colonel James Montgomery with the Second South Carolina Volunteers (an African American regiment), she ventured deep into enemy territory, mapping Confederate positions, identifying supply depots, and recruiting formerly enslaved men to join the Union Army.[^60]

Tubman's most spectacular military achievement came on June 2, 1863, during the Combahee River Raid.[^61] She guided three Union gunboats up the Combahee River in South Carolina, using intelligence she had gathered about Confederate mines and troop positions.[^62] The raid destroyed millions of dollars worth of Confederate supplies and infrastructure.[^63] Most remarkably, approximately 750 enslaved people rushed to the boats to claim their freedom in what became one of the largest slave liberations during the war.[^64] This operation made Tubman the first woman in American history to lead an armed military expedition.[^65]

A contemporary report in the Wisconsin State Journal noted: "Col. Montgomery and his gallant band of 300 black soldiers, under the guidance of a black woman, dashed into the enemy's country...and struck a bold and effective blow, destroying millions of dollars worth of commissary stores, cotton and lordly dwellings."[^66]

Despite her extraordinary service, Tubman struggled to receive proper compensation from the Army.[^67] It took more than 30 years of lobbying before she received a modest pension, initially granted as a widow's benefit for her second husband's military service rather than for her own.[^68] Only in 1899 did she finally receive a small pension for her own service.[^69]

### Post-War Activism

After the war, Tubman settled in Auburn, New York, where she continued her humanitarian work.[^70] She helped formerly enslaved people transition to freedom, providing them with food, shelter, and support.[^71] In the 1890s, she became increasingly involved in the women's suffrage movement, working alongside activists like Susan B. Anthony and Emily Howland.[^72] She spoke at suffrage meetings, arguing that her service during the war entitled her and other women to full citizenship rights, including the vote.[^73]

In her final years, Tubman established the Harriet Tubman Home for Aged and Indigent Colored People on land adjacent to her Auburn property.[^74] Opened in 1908, the home provided care for elderly African Americans who had nowhere else to go.[^75] This institution embodied Tubman's lifelong commitment to collective welfare and community care.[^76]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Harriet Tubman is rightfully celebrated as an American hero, her legacy has been subject to historical debates, mythologization, and modern controversies that complicate her narrative in important ways.

### Historical Inaccuracies and Mythologization

One of the most significant controversies surrounding Tubman concerns the accuracy of claims about her Underground Railroad activities. The widely cited figure that she rescued 300 enslaved people in 19 trips has been debunked by modern historians.[^77] Current scholarship establishes that she made approximately 13 trips and rescued around 70 people.[^78] The inflated numbers originated in Sarah Bradford's 1869 biography, where Bradford acknowledged that Tubman herself "did not remember exact numbers" but included accounts from "other people" claiming 300 rescues.[^79]

Historian Milton Sernett found significant internal inconsistencies in Bradford's early biographies and concluded that "much of what we as Americans thought we knew about Harriet Tubman was not derived from good historical research but was a perpetuation of a larger-than-life story."[^80] Bradford's work employed considerable "artistic license and highly subjective point of view," prioritizing narrative drama over historical accuracy.[^81]

Perhaps most problematically, one of Tubman's most famous alleged quotes—"I freed a thousand slaves; I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew they were slaves"—has been proven completely spurious.[^82] Tubman specialists including Jean H. Humez and Kate Clifford Larson have thoroughly researched primary sources and found no evidence Tubman ever said this.[^83] One historian described it as "a late 20th-century quote from a fictionalized account."[^84] This misattribution has created a false impression of Tubman's views and rhetoric.

### Military Role Debates

Claims that Tubman held the rank of general or formally commanded troops during the Civil War represent another area of historical controversy.[^85] While she certainly guided the Combahee River Raid and worked closely with military leadership, characterizing her as a military commander with official rank has been described by some historians as "wishful thinking."[^86] She served as a scout, spy, and nurse—incredibly valuable roles, but not formal command positions in the military hierarchy.[^87]

Her posthumous commissioning as a Brigadier General by the Maryland National Guard in November 2024—more than 111 years after her death—was a ceremonial honor recognizing her service rather than a reflection of her actual wartime status.[^88]

### Commemoration Controversies

Modern commemorative efforts have generated their own controversies. In 2016, the U.S. Treasury announced plans to feature Tubman on the $20 bill, replacing Andrew Jackson.[^89] The initiative was blocked during the Trump administration, only to be revived under the Biden administration.[^90] Critics argued that placing Tubman—a freedom fighter who opposed American capitalism's dependence on slavery—on currency represented a form of appropriation that was "disrespectful" to her legacy.[^91]

Additionally, some rejected her older portrait photograph as "not glamorous enough" for the $20 bill, revealing uncomfortable biases about age, beauty, and the representation of Black women in public iconography.[^92]

### Political Appropriation and Culture Wars

Tubman's legacy has been invoked across the political spectrum in ways that sometimes distort her actual beliefs and work. In 1994, conservative critic Lynne Cheney cited Tubman in debates over National History Standards, noting she was mentioned six times compared to one mention for Ulysses S. Grant and zero for Robert E. Lee, using this to argue that new historical curricula suffered from political bias.[^93]

Tubman has been appropriated in debates over gun rights (some citing her pistol-carrying as support for the Second Amendment) and by certain Black Power movement elements who emphasized her willingness to use "any means necessary."[^94] While Tubman did carry weapons and was prepared to use them, such selective invocations often ignore the specific context of her armed resistance against the institution of slavery.

### Government Website Censorship

In 2025, a large image and quote from Harriet Tubman were removed from a National Park Service webpage about the Underground Railroad following broader changes to government websites under the Trump administration.[^95] The removal sparked criticism from historians who called Tubman's reduced presence "offensive and absurd," viewing it as part of a broader effort to downplay discussions of slavery and racism in American history.[^96]

### Limited Primary Sources

Because Tubman was illiterate and generated few primary documents, much of her story comes through others' accounts, creating challenges for historians.[^97] Contemporary documentation of her greatest work as an Underground Railroad conductor and Civil War spy is scanty, forcing scholars to rely on later reminiscences, secondhand accounts, and testimonies that may have been embellished or misremembered.[^98] This scarcity of primary sources makes distinguishing historical fact from legend particularly difficult and contributes to ongoing debates about specific details of her life.

## Personal Life

Harriet Tubman's personal life was marked by deep family bonds, complex relationships, physical suffering, and profound spiritual faith. Despite the extraordinary public dimensions of her work, she maintained rich personal connections and domestic commitments throughout her life.

### Marriages and Family

Tubman's first marriage in 1844 to John Tubman, a free Black man, marked an important transition in her life.[^99] It was at this time that she changed her name from Araminta to Harriet, adopting her mother's first name, and took the surname Tubman.[^100] Little is known about the marriage or how long the couple lived together.[^101] The relationship ended painfully when Harriet escaped slavery in 1849 and John declined to join her, choosing to remain in Maryland.[^102] When she returned in 1851 hoping to bring him north, she discovered he had remarried another woman.[^103]

On March 18, 1869, at the age of approximately 47, Tubman married Nelson Davis, a former slave who had served as a private in the 8th United States Colored Infantry Regiment during the Civil War.[^104] Despite being 22 years younger than Tubman, their marriage proved stable and loving.[^105] They were married at the Central Presbyterian Church in Auburn, New York, where Tubman was an active congregant.[^106] In 1874, the couple adopted a baby girl named Gertie Davis, as Tubman had no biological children.[^107] Nelson Davis died of tuberculosis in 1888, leaving Tubman a widow for the final 25 years of her life.[^108]

Tubman maintained fierce devotion to her extended family throughout her life.[^109] After escaping slavery, she risked her freedom repeatedly to rescue family members, successfully bringing her parents, several siblings, nieces, and nephews to freedom.[^110] In 1859, she purchased property in Auburn, New York, from William H. Seward, which became home to her parents and other family members.[^111] She supported her household through a combination of small payments for speaking engagements, sale of farm produce, and the limited proceeds from Sarah Bradford's biographies.[^112]

### Health and Disability

The head injury Tubman suffered at age thirteen profoundly affected her personal life.[^113] She experienced severe headaches, narcoleptic seizures that could strike without warning, and hypersomnia throughout her adult life.[^114] These episodes could leave her unconscious for extended periods, creating dangerous situations during her Underground Railroad missions.[^115] Contemporary accounts describe her falling asleep suddenly during conversations or activities, sometimes in the middle of sentences.[^116]

In her later years, Tubman's health deteriorated further.[^117] She underwent brain surgery in 1898 at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, refusing anesthesia and instead biting down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do.[^118] The surgery provided some relief but did not cure her chronic pain.[^119] By the early 1900s, she was increasingly frail and suffering from pneumonia.[^120]

### Spiritual Life and Personality

Tubman's spiritual faith formed the core of her identity and guided her actions throughout her life.[^121] She experienced vivid religious visions and dreams, which she interpreted as divine guidance.[^122] "Twasn't me, 'twas the Lord!" she often said of her achievements. "I always told Him, 'I trust to you. I don't know where to go or what to do, but I expect You to lead me,' an' He always did."[^123]

Her spirituality was deeply practical, informing her strategic decisions and providing courage in the face of mortal danger.[^124] She believed God protected her during her dangerous missions and gave her premonitions of danger.[^125] Her faith combined African spiritual traditions, Christianity, and mystical experiences into a unique religious worldview.[^126]

Those who knew Tubman described her as fearless, determined, and utterly committed to justice.[^127] Frederick Douglass wrote to her in 1868: "The difference between us is very marked. Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has been in public... You, on the other hand, have labored in a private way... The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism."[^128]

Despite her legendary toughness, Tubman also showed tenderness and care, particularly in her work nursing the sick and elderly.[^129] She was known for her storytelling ability and her humor, often entertaining audiences with dramatic accounts of her adventures.[^130]

### Final Years

In her last years, Tubman lived in poverty despite her extraordinary service to the nation.[^131] She finally received a small government pension in 1899, but it barely covered her expenses.[^132] She continued her charitable work, operating the Harriet Tubman Home for Aged and Indigent Colored People, though she eventually became too frail to manage it and deeded the property to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church.[^133]

On March 10, 1913, Harriet Tubman died of pneumonia at approximately age 91, surrounded by family and friends at the Home she had established.[^134] Her funeral was held with military honors, a fitting tribute to a woman who had served her country and her people with unmatched courage.[^135] She was buried at Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn, New York.[^136]

## Legacy

Harriet Tubman's legacy extends far beyond her lifetime achievements, shaping American collective memory, inspiring social justice movements, and establishing her as one of the most significant figures in United States history.

### Symbol of Freedom and Resistance

Tubman's life story has become synonymous with the fight for freedom and human dignity.[^137] The National Museum of African American History and Culture recognizes her as an enduring symbol of courage and liberation, with her personal effects serving as powerful artifacts connecting past struggles to present-day freedom movements.[^138] Her narrative demonstrates that marginalized individuals can fundamentally alter the course of history through courage, determination, and strategic action.[^139]

As historian Deidre Cooper Owens observed, Tubman "offered up a version of freedom where a disabled Black woman sat at the center of it, where Black women were liberators, and where liberation was communal and democratic."[^140] This vision challenged and continues to challenge conventional narratives about who can be heroes and what heroism looks like.[^141]

### Connection to Contemporary Movements

Tubman's relevance extends powerfully into the twenty-first century. Scholars and activists have drawn direct connections between her declaration that Black lives matter—made through her actions freeing enslaved people—and the modern Black Lives Matter movement.[^142] Professor Kate Clifford Larson notes that Tubman recognized her freedom was "tied to the broader black freedom struggle to not only end slavery, but to push the republic to recognize black people as human beings."[^143]

In the era of Black Lives Matter, Tubman's most important legacy is as a role model for resistance against systemic oppression.[^144] Her willingness to risk everything repeatedly for others' freedom provides a blueprint for sustained activist commitment.[^145] Her story reminds contemporary audiences that meaningful social change requires sacrifice, strategic planning, and collective action rather than individual heroism alone.[^146]

### Educational and Commemorative Impact

Tubman's legacy is preserved and propagated through numerous commemorative sites, educational institutions, and public monuments. The Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park in Maryland and the Harriet Tubman National Historical Park in Auburn, New York, draw hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.[^147] Schools, scholarships, and community organizations bearing her name keep her memory alive across generations.[^148]

In November 2024, Maryland posthumously commissioned Tubman as a one-star Brigadier General in the Maryland National Guard, recognizing her military service and leadership.[^149] The Governor of Maryland called her "one of the greatest authors of the American story."[^150] The same year, the United States Mint launched the 2024 Harriet Tubman Commemorative Coin Program, further cementing her place in national iconography.[^151]

### Influence on Gender and Disability History

Tubman's legacy profoundly impacts women's history and disability studies. Her service during the Civil War challenged nineteenth-century gender norms by demonstrating women's capacity for military leadership and strategic thinking.[^152] Her later activism in the women's suffrage movement connected struggles for racial and gender equality.[^153]

As a disabled woman who accomplished extraordinary feats despite lifelong neurological challenges from her head injury, Tubman has become an important figure in disability history.[^154] She refused to allow her seizures and chronic pain to limit her commitment to justice, providing a powerful counter-narrative to stereotypes about disability and capability.[^155]

### Lessons for Contemporary Society

Tubman's impact teaches several enduring lessons. First, she embodied selflessness and collective care, living a life "not focused on material accumulation" but rather on community liberation.[^156] Second, she demonstrated that effective activism requires both moral conviction and strategic intelligence—her success came from careful planning, not just bravery.[^157] Third, she proved that marginalized people need not wait for others to grant their freedom but can seize it through organized resistance.[^158]

Her life also provides a "blueprint for women of all backgrounds, granting each generation that comes after her with a renewed sense of optimism" about the possibility of transformative change.[^159] In an era of persistent racial and economic inequality, Tubman's insistence on communal freedom rather than individual escape remains profoundly relevant.[^160]

### Ongoing Debates and Evolution

Tubman's legacy continues to evolve as new scholarship emerges and contemporary issues reshape how we understand her significance.[^161] Recent efforts to feature her on the $20 bill, debates over how her story should be taught in schools, and controversies over historical markers and website content demonstrate that her memory remains contested terrain in American cultural politics.[^162]

This ongoing engagement with Tubman's legacy—including correcting historical inaccuracies and pushing back against attempts to minimize discussions of slavery—ensures she remains a living presence in American consciousness rather than a static historical figure.[^163] As the National Museum of African American History and Culture notes, "continued discussions about and homages to Tubman stems from her powerful narrative of taking control of her own destiny and ultimately forging a path for others."[^164]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic scholarship and popular memory have celebrated Harriet Tubman as one of the most significant figures in American history, with positive assessments emphasizing her multifaceted contributions to freedom, equality, and social justice.

Historian Catherine Clinton and Kate Clifford Larson, authors of the first scholarly biographies of Tubman published around 2004, established her as a figure whose importance extends far beyond folklore.[^165] Their research demonstrated that despite the scarcity of primary sources—Tubman was illiterate and left few written documents—careful historical investigation reveals a woman of extraordinary intelligence, courage, and strategic capability.[^166]

Scholars emphasize that Tubman was "arguably the most effective activist of her time because of her work on the Underground Railroad, her activism in support of the Union cause during the Civil War, and her ability to draw audiences in during speeches about her life and work to garner support for abolition."[^167] This multidimensional activism distinguished her from contemporaries who excelled in single domains.[^168]

Academic assessments highlight that Tubman's "widely recognized successful work for the Underground Railroad overshadowed many other noteworthy contributions she made as a peacemaker and stateswoman, as she rose above the societal limitations imposed by being enslaved and a woman."[^169] She was not merely a conductor but a "formidable commander and strategist" whose military contributions during the Civil War warrant serious historical attention.[^170]

Disability studies scholars have positioned Tubman as a pioneering figure who challenged assumptions about capability and productivity. Historian Deidre Cooper Owens argues that Tubman's vision of freedom was revolutionary because it centered a disabled Black woman as a liberator, demonstrating that "liberation was communal and democratic" rather than dependent on able-bodied saviors.[^171]

Frederick Douglass, the most famous African American of his era, wrote admiringly to Tubman in 1868, acknowledging that while his work had been public and celebrated, her private, dangerous work was perhaps more heroic: "The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism."[^172]

Contemporary scholars argue that Tubman's legacy provides essential lessons for modern social justice movements. She is celebrated as a role model for sustained commitment to collective liberation rather than individual advancement, for strategic thinking combined with moral courage, and for her refusal to accept oppressive systems as unchangeable.[^173]

The National Museum of African American History and Culture describes her as "one of the outstanding heroines of the antebellum and Civil War eras," whose iconic status among nineteenth-century African Americans and all those opposing slavery remains undiminished.[^174] Her story grants "each generation that comes after her with a renewed sense of optimism" about the possibility of transformative social change.[^175]

### Negative Views

While Harriet Tubman is overwhelmingly celebrated, several critical perspectives and concerns have emerged in scholarly and public discourse, focusing primarily on mythologization, historical inaccuracies, and debates over commemoration rather than criticism of Tubman herself.

The most substantial scholarly critique addresses the mythologization of Tubman's story at the expense of historical accuracy. Historian Milton Sernett's research revealed that "much of what we as Americans thought we knew about Harriet Tubman was not derived from good historical research but was a perpetuation of a larger-than-life story."[^176] Sarah Bradford's early biographies, which shaped popular understanding of Tubman for over a century, employed significant "artistic license and highly subjective point of view," creating internal inconsistencies that modern scholars have struggled to reconcile.[^177]

Some historians have expressed frustration that the exaggerated claims about Tubman—particularly the debunked assertion that she rescued 300 people—have distorted public understanding and diverted attention from her actual documented achievements, which are remarkable enough without embellishment.[^178] As one NPR report on a Tubman historical marker noted, the "outdated and incorrect" information required correction to properly honor her legacy.[^179]

Critical scholarly perspectives also address the challenge of separating Tubman's authentic voice and beliefs from interpretations imposed upon her. Since she left few primary documents and her words come primarily through intermediaries, there is concern about how much of "her" story actually reflects others' agendas.[^180] The completely spurious quote about freeing "a thousand slaves" demonstrates how easily false narratives can be attributed to historical figures and then become widely accepted as fact.[^181]

Some historians have pushed back against claims that overstate Tubman's formal military role. While her service as a scout, spy, and guide for the Combahee River Raid was extraordinary, characterizations of her as holding official rank or military command have been described as "wishful thinking" that projects contemporary desires onto historical reality.[^182] These scholars argue for appreciating what she actually accomplished rather than inflating her roles with anachronistic titles and positions.

Debates over Tubman's commemoration have revealed tensions about how historical figures should be honored. Critics of the plan to feature her on the $20 bill argue that placing an anti-slavery activist and critic of American capitalism on currency represents a form of appropriation that is "disrespectful" to her actual beliefs and legacy.[^183] Some view such commemorations as attempts to sanitize Tubman's radical resistance into acceptable mainstream symbolism.[^184]

Conservative critics have occasionally invoked Tubman in culture war debates in ways that scholars view as distortions of historical perspective. Lynne Cheney's 1994 critique of National History Standards used Tubman's prominence (six mentions compared to Ulysses Grant's one) to argue that new curricula were politically biased, framing greater attention to previously marginalized voices as problematic rather than corrective.[^185]

Recent controversies over government websites removing or minimizing references to Tubman and the Underground Railroad have sparked concern among historians that her legacy is being weaponized in contemporary political battles over how American history—particularly regarding slavery and racism—should be presented.[^186] The removal of her image from National Park Service materials was called "offensive and absurd" by historians who saw it as an attempt to downplay difficult historical truths.[^187]

Finally, some critical perspectives note that the focus on Tubman as an individual hero, while understandable and in many ways deserved, can obscure the collective nature of resistance to slavery. The Underground Railroad functioned through networks of hundreds of people—Black and white, free and enslaved—and emphasizing Tubman's singular heroism may inadvertently minimize the contributions of countless others whose names are lost to history.[^188]
