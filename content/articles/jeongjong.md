## Summary

Jeongjong (born July 26, 1357; died October 26, 1419) was the 2nd King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning briefly from 1398 to 1400.[^1] Born **Yi Bang-gwa**, he was the second son of King Taejo. He was a capable military general who fought alongside his father, but he had no political ambition to be King. He was thrust onto the throne after the **First Strife of Princes** as a figurehead, while real power was held by his younger brother, **Yi Bang-won** (Taejong). Recognizing the reality of the situation, he wisely abdicated after only two years to ensure his own survival and political stability.[^2]

## The Reluctant King

After Yi Bang-won killed the Crown Prince (their half-brother) in 1398, Taejo abdicated in shock. Yi Bang-won declined to take the throne immediately to avoid looking like a usurper, so the crown passed to the oldest surviving legitimate son, Yi Bang-gwa.
*   **Puppet Reign:** Jeongjong spent his reign indulging in hunting and the game of **Gyeokgu** (Korean polo) to signal to his ambitious brother that he had no desire for power.
*   **Capital Move:** He briefly moved the capital back to **Kaesong** (the old Goryeo capital), driven by bad omens and the fratricidal bloodshed in Seoul.[^3]

## Abdication and Later Life

In 1400, after the **Second Strife of Princes** (where Yi Bang-won defeated another brother, Yi Bang-gan), Jeongjong officially appointed Yi Bang-won as Crown Prince and abdicated.
*   **Survival:** By giving up power voluntarily, he lived a long and peaceful life as King Emeritus, dying of natural causes in 1419. He is often praised for his wisdom in knowing when to step down.[^4]
