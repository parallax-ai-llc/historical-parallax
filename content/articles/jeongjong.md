## Overview

**Jeongjong** (1357–1419) was the 2nd King of Joseon. He is often forgotten, sandwiched between his legendary father (Taejo) and his powerful younger brother (Taejong/Yi Bang-won). His reign lasted only 2 years (1398–1400). He was essentially a placeholder. After the **First Strife of Princes**, where Yi Bang-won killed his half-brothers to seize power, Taejo abdicated in disgust. Yi Bang-won, feeling it was too early to take the throne himself, installed his older brother Jeongjong as a puppet.

## The Reluctant King

Jeongjong knew his position was precarious. He knew his brother Bang-won held the real power (control of the private armies).
To convince Bang-won he had no political ambition, Jeongjong spent his time playing **Gyeokgu** (Korean polo) and hunting, deliberately ignoring state affairs.
This "acting stupid/disinterested" strategy likely saved his life.

## Achievements

Despite being a figurehead, he did make some decisions (likely dictated by Bang-won):
- **Moved Capital back to Kaesong:** Briefly moved the capital from Hanyang back to Kaesong (the old Goryeo capital), hoping to escape the bad omens of the the fratricide in Hanyang.
- **Banned Private Armies:** He initiated the disbandment of private armies (innovation of Bang-won), which centralized military power to the King.

## The Second Strife and Abdication

In 1400, another brother (Yi Bang-gan) rebelled against Yi Bang-won (**Second Strife of Princes**).
Bang-won crushed the rebellion.
Jeongjong realized it was time to leave. He declared Bang-won his heir and abdicated voluntarily.
**Life After Throne:**
He lived for another 19 years as a Retired King (Taesangwang). He lived a comfortable, hedonistic life, fathering 15 princes and 8 princesses with various concubines, and died of old age at 63—a rare happy ending for a deposed monarch.
