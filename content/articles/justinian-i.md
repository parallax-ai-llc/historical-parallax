## Summary

Justinian I, known as Justinian the Great, was Byzantine Emperor from 527 to 565 CE and stands as one of the most significant rulers in late Roman and Byzantine history[^1]. Born into humble peasant origins in Illyria, he rose to become an emperor whose ambitious vision encompassed the reconquest of lost Western Roman territories, comprehensive legal reform, and magnificent architectural projects including the Hagia Sophia[^2]. His reign witnessed both extraordinary achievements—most notably the codification of Roman law in the Corpus Juris Civilis—and devastating challenges such as the Nika riots and the Justinianic Plague[^3]. Though controversial in his own time and debated by modern scholars, Justinian's legacy profoundly shaped Western legal systems, Byzantine culture, and the course of medieval European history[^4].

---

## Early Life and Background

Justinian I was born around 482 CE in Tauresium, a small village in the province of Dardania (near modern-day Skopje, North Macedonia), to peasant parents of either Illyro-Roman or Thraco-Roman origin[^5]. His birth name was Petrus Sabbatius, reflecting his humble provincial background far removed from the imperial splendor he would later command[^6]. His mother, Vigilantia, was the sister of Justin, who served in the Excubitor—the elite imperial bodyguard in Constantinople[^7]. This familial connection would prove transformative for the young Justinian's future.

Recognizing the boy's intelligence and potential, his uncle Justin brought him to Constantinople to ensure he received a proper education befitting someone destined for higher stations[^8]. In the capital, Justinian immersed himself in studies that would define his later reign: jurisprudence, theology, and Roman history became the pillars of his intellectual formation[^9]. Though he received an excellent education, contemporary sources note that he always spoke Greek with a noticeable accent, marking him as a native Latin speaker—believed to be the last Roman emperor for whom Latin was the first language[^10].

The relationship between uncle and nephew deepened over time, culminating in Justin's formal adoption of Petrus Sabbatius, who then took the name Iustinianus (Justinian) to honor his adoptive father and benefactor[^11]. This adoption was not merely symbolic; it represented a calculated strategy to position Justinian as Justin's heir and to provide the childless emperor with a capable successor[^12]. During his formative years in Constantinople, Justinian witnessed firsthand the complexities of imperial administration, the intricacies of court politics, and the delicate balance between secular and ecclesiastical authority that characterized Byzantine governance.

## Rise to Power

When Emperor Anastasius died in 518 CE, the succession remained uncertain until the imperial bodyguard elevated Justin to the throne[^13]. Though Justin had risen from humble origins like his nephew, he lacked the education and political sophistication that Justinian possessed in abundance. From the moment of Justin's accession, the younger man became a powerful influence in guiding imperial policy, effectively serving as the intellectual force behind the aging emperor's throne[^14].

Justinian's ascent through the imperial hierarchy was methodical and strategic. In 520, he was appointed consul and commander of the army of the east, positions that gave him both prestige and practical military authority[^15]. The following year, he served as Consul, one of the most honorable positions in the Roman tradition[^16]. His growing prominence at court was formalized in 525 when Emperor Justin granted him the titles of nobilissimus and caesar, explicitly designating him as heir-apparent to the imperial throne[^17].

That same year, 525, Justinian made a decision that would prove both personally significant and politically controversial: he married Theodora, a woman whose background could not have been more different from the imperial circles in which Justinian moved[^18]. Theodora had worked as an actress and performer, professions associated with low social status in Roman society. Indeed, existing laws from Constantine's time explicitly barred members of the senatorial class from marrying actresses[^19]. Empress Euphemia, Justin's wife, strongly opposed the marriage, recognizing the social scandal it represented[^20].

Justinian's determination to marry Theodora reveals much about his character. Attracted by her beauty and intelligence, he made her his mistress but refused to leave their relationship in legal limbo[^21]. He convinced his uncle to change the law, raising Theodora's legal status and creating new legislation specifically to allow their marriage[^22]. This early demonstration of Justinian's willingness to reshape legal frameworks to achieve his objectives would characterize his entire reign.

On April 1, 527, Justin crowned Justinian as co-emperor with the rank of augustus, making the succession arrangement explicit and official[^23]. Four months later, on August 1, 527, the elderly Justin died, and Justinian succeeded him as sole emperor of the Byzantine Empire[^24]. At approximately 45 years old, Justinian assumed control of an empire that stretched from the Balkans to the Near East, but which had lost the wealthy western provinces—Italy, North Africa, and Spain—to various barbarian kingdoms over the previous century. His vision for recovering these lost territories and restoring the full glory of the Roman Empire would drive much of his foreign policy for decades to come.

## Major Achievements

### The Corpus Juris Civilis: Legal Revolution

Justinian's most enduring achievement, one that arguably had greater impact on Western civilization than any other book except the Bible, was the comprehensive codification of Roman law known as the Corpus Juris Civilis (Body of Civil Law)[^25]. Upon ascending to the throne, Justinian was keenly aware of the chaotic state of Roman legal tradition: centuries of imperial edicts, contradictory interpretations, inconsistent legal codes, and complex constitutional provisions had created a system that was inefficient, slow, and often incomprehensible[^26].

Just six months after becoming sole emperor in 527, Justinian assembled a legal commission headed by Tribonian, his trusted jurist and advisor, charging them with the monumental task of streamlining all existing Roman laws and crafting a new code that would simplify and clarify the entire legal process[^27]. The resulting work consisted of four major components:

The **Codex Constitutionum** (Code), completed in its first edition in 529 and revised in 534, contained 12 books with 4,562 imperial edicts from the time of Emperor Hadrian to Justinian himself, organized thematically with proper attribution and dating[^28]. The **Digesta** or **Digest**, compiled between 530 and 533 by a commission of 16 lawyers under Tribonian's presidency, represented perhaps the most ambitious element: the team collected and examined all known writings of all authorized jurists, extracting whatever was deemed valuable and generally selecting only one extract on any given legal point to eliminate contradictions[^29].

The **Institutiones** (Institutes), an elementary textbook compiled and published in 533 under Tribonian's supervision, was designed specifically for first-year law students, making the principles of Roman law accessible to new generations of legal scholars[^30]. Finally, the **Novellae Constitutiones Post Codicem** (New Constitutions After the Code) contained new ordinances issued by Justinian himself between 534 and 565, ensuring the legal code remained current throughout his reign[^31].

The impact of Justinian's legal reforms cannot be overstated. The Corpus Juris Civilis provided the foundation of law in all civil law jurisdictions and influenced the canon law of the Roman Catholic Church; it was said that _ecclesia vivit lege romana_—"the church lives by Roman law"[^32]. The provisions of this legal code influenced emerging European nations and continue to shape Western legal systems to the present day[^33].

### The Reconquest: Military Campaigns in the West

Justinian's military ambitions were driven by a vision of _renovatio imperii_—the restoration of the Roman Empire to its former territorial extent[^34]. This represented the last serious attempt by an emperor in Constantinople to recover the western provinces lost to barbarian invasions in the previous century[^35]. To achieve this goal, Justinian relied on two exceptional military commanders: Belisarius and Narses.

The reconquest began in North Africa in 533 CE, when Belisarius and his troops landed unopposed on the African coast to confront the Vandal kingdom[^36]. In a remarkably swift campaign lasting just one year, Belisarius conquered the entire Vandal kingdom, restoring North Africa to imperial control[^37]. This stunning success emboldened Justinian to pursue his next, far more ambitious target: Italy.

The Gothic War against the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, which lasted from 535 to 554, unfolded in two distinct phases[^38]. The first phase, from 535 to 540, saw Belisarius make remarkable progress. By 536, only a year after the war began, Rome was again under imperial control[^39]. By 540, Belisarius controlled most of the Italian peninsula, and the Byzantine army reached Ravenna, the capital of the Ostrogothic Kingdom[^40].

However, the apparent reconquest proved illusory. The second phase, from 540/541 to 553, featured a Gothic revival under their brilliant king Totila, which could only be suppressed after a prolonged and exhausting struggle[^41]. Justinian eventually turned to his other great general, Narses, whose later campaigns proved decisive. Narses achieved critical victories at the Battle of Taginae in 552, where he defeated and killed King Totila, and at the Battle of Mons Lactarius in 553, effectively ending the Ostrogothic kingdom[^42].

While Justinian's forces also made gains in Spain, the costs of these campaigns were staggering. The wars drained the Byzantine treasury, exhausted the army, and—particularly in Italy—devastated the local economy and population[^43]. Rigorous financial exactions and the rapacity of the soldiers made the new Byzantine regime deeply unpopular in the reconquered territories[^44].

### Architectural Magnificence: The Hagia Sophia and Beyond

Justinian's building projects transformed Constantinople and other major cities of the empire, with the reconstruction of the Hagia Sophia standing as the crown jewel of Byzantine architecture[^45]. The opportunity for this magnificent project arose from catastrophe: the Nika riots of 532 had burned much of central Constantinople, including the previous cathedral of Hagia Sophia[^46].

Only weeks after the destruction, on February 23, 532, Justinian inaugurated construction of an entirely new and revolutionary basilica, larger and more majestic than anything previously attempted[^47]. He commissioned two Greek geometers, Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles, as architects for the project[^48]. More than ten thousand workers were employed during the construction process[^49].

The completed structure, inaugurated by Justinian and Patriarch Menas on December 27, 537—just five years and ten months after construction began—was an architectural marvel[^50]. The vast, airy central basilica featured a technically complex system of vaults and semi-domes, culminating in a high central dome with a diameter of over 101 feet (31 meters) and a height of 160 feet (48.5 meters)[^51]. The dome's construction was so impressive that Procopius, the emperor's biographer and author of a book on Justinian's buildings, asserted that the dome appeared to hover over the building by divine intervention[^52].

Upon seeing the finished cathedral, Emperor Justinian reportedly exclaimed, "Solomon, I have surpassed thee," comparing his achievement to the legendary Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem[^53]. The Hagia Sophia remains today one of the world's great monuments and the most important Byzantine structure in existence[^54].

Beyond the Hagia Sophia, Justinian's building program encompassed the reconstruction of Constantinople's center, numerous churches, fortifications throughout the empire, and infrastructure projects that demonstrated both his wealth and his commitment to leaving a permanent mark on the urban landscape[^55].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Religious Persecution and Intolerance

Despite his Christian piety—or perhaps because of it—Justinian implemented policies of religious persecution that targeted Jews, Samaritans, pagans, and Christian heretics with equal severity[^56]. As a staunch supporter of orthodox Christianity as the state religion, he restricted the civil rights of Jews and threatened their religious privileges[^57]. In 529, he banned Samaritans from making wills, an intentional act of legal humiliation designed to marginalize the community[^58].

Justinian's persecution extended to ancient religious and intellectual traditions. Pagans, heretics, and Samaritans were forbidden to teach any subject whatsoever, and in a move with profound cultural consequences, Justinian ordered the closure of the once-famous Academy at Athens, expelling pagan teachers and effectively ending nearly a millennium of continuous philosophical instruction[^59]. He introduced anti-Jewish measures that even forbade the use of Hebrew in certain contexts[^60]. Apostasy from Christianity became punishable by death, and in newly conquered provinces like North Africa, Jews and heretics were forbidden from practicing their religious rites, with synagogues and meeting places confiscated and converted to Christian ecclesiastical use[^61].

Laying down the principle that "from those who are not orthodox in their worship of God, earthly goods should also be withheld," Justinian made orthodox belief a prerequisite for state service and legal practice[^62]. Heretics were deprived of common citizenship rights: they could not inherit property, had severely limited testamentary rights, and could not appear in court to bear witness against orthodox persons[^63]. The Manicheans, followers of the dualist religion founded by Mani, suffered particularly harsh persecution, experiencing both exile and the threat of capital punishment[^64].

### Ecclesiastical Tyranny and the Three Chapters Controversy

Even within Christianity, Justinian's attempts to enforce religious unity often backfired, creating schisms rather than resolving them. He appears in some historical accounts as a persecutor of the Church itself, taking his place among semi-Monophysite tyrants who caused quarrels and divisions[^65]. His ecclesiastical tyranny represents perhaps the most regrettable aspect of his character from the perspective of orthodox Christian historians[^66].

The Three Chapters Controversy exemplifies Justinian's problematic religious policies. In 543-544, seeking to reconcile Monophysite Christians (who rejected the Council of Chalcedon's teaching that Christ had two distinct natures) with Chalcedonian orthodoxy, Justinian promoted the anathematization of the "Three Chapters": the person and writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, certain writings of Theodoret of Cyrrhus, and the letter of Ibas to Maris[^67]. All three were theologians who had opposed Monophysitism, but Justinian's strategy was to condemn them as having Nestorian tendencies, hoping this would appeal to Monophysites while still maintaining Chalcedonian doctrine[^68].

The strategy failed spectacularly. Justinian achieved nothing by the episode: he did not conciliate the Monophysites, he enraged the Christian community in Antioch by attacking its respected teachers, and he aroused fierce opposition in Rome[^69]. His treatment of Pope Vigilius was particularly scandalous: the pope was forcibly brought to Constantinople, held against his will, and besieged at a chapel until he finally gave his assent to the emperor's demands[^70]. The Second Council of Constantinople in 553, which Justinian convened to ratify his position, both confirmed the canons of Chalcedon and condemned the Three Chapters, but the controversy left lasting divisions[^71].

### The Justinianic Plague and Its Consequences

One of the greatest catastrophes of Justinian's reign was the outbreak of the bubonic plague that struck the Byzantine Empire beginning in 541 CE and recurred for the next two centuries[^72]. Known as the Plague of Justinian or the Justinianic Plague, it was an epidemic that afflicted the entire Mediterranean Basin, Europe, the Near East, and especially the Byzantine and Sasanian Persian Empires[^73].

The plague's mortality was devastating. According to traditional "maximalist" estimates, it killed between 25 and 100 million people over two centuries of recurrence, a death toll equivalent to 25 to 60% of Europe's population at the time of the first outbreak[^74]. In Constantinople specifically, some sources claim the plague killed up to 5,000 people per day at its peak, though Procopius's figure of 10,000 daily deaths is considered an exaggeration[^75]. For infected individuals without modern medical treatment, the mortality rate ranged between 60-80%[^76].

Justinian himself contracted the disease in 542 at the height of the epidemic but recovered, one of the fortunate minority who survived infection[^77]. However, recent revisionist scholarship has challenged the traditional maximalist view. Historians Lee Mordechai and Merle Eisenberg argue that while the plague caused high mortality in specific locations, it did not cause the widespread demographic decline or decimation of Mediterranean populations that earlier historians assumed[^78]. They contend that various datasets fail to support the maximalist paradigm and instead suggest continuity across the plague period[^79]. The debate over the plague's true demographic and economic impact continues among scholars.

### Procopius's Secret History: A Scathing Indictment

The most devastating contemporary criticism of Justinian comes from an unexpected source: his own court historian, Procopius of Caesarea. While Procopius publicly authored admiring works including the _Wars_ (describing Justinian's military campaigns) and _Buildings_ (celebrating his architectural achievements), he also secretly wrote the _Anecdota_ or _Secret History_, a vicious and scandalous attack on Justinian and Theodora that was not published during his lifetime[^80].

Written around 550 CE (perhaps as late as 558), the _Secret History_ presents a stark contrast to Procopius's official works[^81]. Instead of praising Justinian's reign and reconquest of the West, the text is a calculated and brutal critique of the imperial couple, their advisors, and the entire court system[^82]. Procopius portrays Justinian as literally demonic—not metaphorically tyrannical, but actually a demon in human form[^83]. The work includes bizarre supernatural accounts claiming the emperor's inhuman nature.

Politically, Procopius accuses Justinian of deliberately destroying the empire through arbitrary legal decisions, acceptance of bribes, and overruling his own laws for monetary gain[^84]. Economically, the _Secret History_ claims the emperor overtaxed the Roman people into mass poverty[^85]. However, modern scholars caution that Procopius's _Secret History_ should be contextualized within the political tensions of the Byzantine elite and read as blending intriguing historical details with the author's personal agenda and grievances[^86].

## Personal Life

### Marriage to Theodora: An Extraordinary Partnership

The relationship between Justinian and Theodora represents one of history's most remarkable imperial partnerships, bringing together two individuals from vastly different backgrounds into a marriage that defied social conventions and shaped Byzantine policy for more than two decades[^87]. Theodora's early life was scandalous by aristocratic standards: she had worked as an actress and entertainer, professions that Roman society associated with prostitution and moral degradation[^88].

Despite the social barriers—Constantine-era laws explicitly prohibited senators from marrying actresses—Justinian was captivated by Theodora's beauty and intelligence[^89]. Their relationship began with Theodora as his mistress, but Justinian refused to accept this arrangement permanently[^90]. In a demonstration of both his political power and personal devotion, he convinced his uncle Emperor Justin to change the laws, first raising Theodora's legal status and then creating new legislation specifically to permit their marriage[^91]. Empress Euphemia, Justin's wife, strongly opposed the union, but her death removed the final obstacle[^92].

The couple married in 525, two years before Justinian became sole emperor[^93]. When he ascended to the throne, Justinian insisted that Theodora be crowned as his equal partner, not merely as his consort—an unusual arrangement that reflected the genuine partnership that characterized their relationship[^94]. Contemporary sources report that the couple matched each other in intelligence, ambition, and energy[^95]. Justinian sought Theodora's advice on major policy decisions and formally acknowledged her role, calling her his "partner in my deliberations" in Novel 8.1 (535 CE)[^96].

Theodora maintained her own court and controlled her own budget, working with Justinian on many of his most important projects[^97]. He valued her ideas and respected her position in ways uncommon for Byzantine emperors. Her most famous moment came during the Nika riots of January 532, when Justinian and his advisors considered fleeing Constantinople. According to Procopius, Theodora saved the situation by chastising her husband and delivering a memorable speech, declaring that "royal purple makes a fine burial shroud"—meaning she would rather die as empress than live as a fugitive[^98]. Her courage stiffened Justinian's resolve, leading to his decision to remain and crush the rebellion.

### Theodora's Death and Justinian's Grief

Theodora died on June 28, 548, possibly of cancer, after more than two decades as empress[^99]. Her death had a profound and visible impact on Justinian, who never remarried despite being only in his mid-sixties and having no heir[^100]. During a procession in 559, eleven years after her death, Justinian visited Theodora's tomb and lit candles in her memory, demonstrating that his devotion endured long after her passing[^101]. Historical sources emphasize that Justinian loved only Theodora for his entire life, a remarkable statement about marital fidelity in the context of Byzantine imperial history[^102].

### Character and Personality

Sources describe Justinian as deeply committed to duty, personal honor, and integrity, setting a standard rarely matched by Roman emperors[^103]. He sought little for himself and dedicated his efforts to what he understood as the empire's welfare[^104]. His daily routine reflected his intense work ethic: he was known for working long hours, personally involving himself in administrative details, and maintaining direct oversight of policy implementation.

However, this dedication also manifested as autocratic tendencies and unwillingness to delegate authority, characteristics that contributed to accusations of tyranny[^105]. Justinian's reign was not universally popular; beyond the Nika riots early in his rule, a conspiracy against his life was discovered as late as 562, demonstrating ongoing opposition to his policies[^106].

Justinian died on November 14, 565, at approximately 83 years old, having ruled for nearly 38 years—one of the longest reigns in Roman and Byzantine history[^107]. He died childless, and the throne passed to Justin II, the son of his sister Vigilantia[^108].

## Legacy

### Legal and Cultural Impact

Justinian's most profound and enduring legacy lies in the Corpus Juris Civilis, which preserved Roman legal tradition and provided the foundation for modern civil law systems across the Western world[^109]. The nearly forty-year reign produced extensive territorial expansion, military successes, and a new synthesis of Greco-Roman and Christian culture visible at all levels of Byzantine society[^110]. One of the most enduring aspects of his legacy was this uniform rewriting of Roman law, first applied throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and still serving as the basis of civil law in many modern states[^111].

The codification efforts not only preserved and systematized Roman legal principles but also set a benchmark for legal clarity and uniformity that influenced emerging European nations[^112]. The Corpus Juris Civilis influenced canon law of the Roman Catholic Church and became foundational to the legal systems of continental Europe[^113]. Whatever blame might be assigned for Justinian's mistakes, he clearly left a remarkable legacy for the future of Western civilization that any monarch would envy[^114].

### Architectural and Artistic Heritage

The Hagia Sophia stands as Justinian's most visible architectural legacy, remaining one of the world's great monuments and the most important Byzantine structure in existence[^115]. Beyond this masterpiece, his extensive building program transformed Constantinople and cities throughout the empire, establishing aesthetic and architectural standards that defined Byzantine culture for centuries[^116]. The famous mosaics at San Vitale in Ravenna, completed in 547, depict Justinian and Theodora in magnificent detail, providing iconic images that continue to represent Byzantine imperial power in historical and educational contexts[^117].

### Territorial and Military Legacy

Justinian's military campaigns successfully reclaimed territories from the Vandals in North Africa and the Ostrogoths in Italy, representing the last serious attempt to restore the Roman Empire's western territories[^118]. While these conquests proved difficult to maintain and expensive to achieve, they temporarily restored imperial control over the Mediterranean basin and demonstrated Byzantine military capabilities[^119]. However, the wars drained the treasury and exhausted the army, leaving the empire vulnerable to future challenges, including the rise of Islam less than a century after Justinian's death[^120].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarly assessments of Justinian frequently emphasize his extraordinary accomplishments in law, architecture, and imperial administration. David Gwynn, associate professor of ancient and late antique history at Royal Holloway, University of London, notes that evaluating Justinian requires examining both contemporary sources and modern scholarly interpretations, which reveal a complex figure of genuine historical significance[^121].

Supporters highlight Justinian's dedication to duty, personal integrity, and vision for preserving Roman imperial tradition in an age of transformation[^122]. The legal codification alone represents an achievement of incalculable value to Western civilization, preserving classical Roman jurisprudence and making it accessible to medieval and modern legal systems[^123]. His building projects, particularly the Hagia Sophia, demonstrated both aesthetic vision and technical sophistication that established new standards for Christian architecture[^124].

The reconquest campaigns, while ultimately unsustainable, demonstrated Byzantine military resilience and temporarily restored imperial authority over significant portions of the former Western Empire[^125]. From this perspective, Justinian's reign represents the high-water mark of Byzantine power and ambition, a final flowering of Roman imperial glory before the challenges of the seventh century transformed the Mediterranean world[^126].

Justinian's administrative reforms streamlined provincial governance, reduced corruption (at least in intent), and attempted to create more efficient tax collection and judicial systems[^127]. His religious policies, while intolerant by modern standards, reflected genuine theological conviction and efforts to maintain Christian unity within the empire[^128]. The Metropolitan Museum of Art's assessment notes that "the nearly forty-year reign of Emperor Justinian I heralded extensive territorial expansion and military success, along with a new synthesis of Greco-Roman and Christian culture seen at all levels of Byzantine culture"[^129].

### Negative Views

Critics of Justinian present a fundamentally different assessment, asking whether he was "an autocratic tyrant whose ambitions left his empire overstretched and vulnerable"[^130]. This critical perspective emphasizes the enormous costs of his policies: the reconquest wars drained the imperial treasury, devastated Italy's economy and population, and ultimately proved impossible to sustain[^131]. Within decades of his death, much of the reconquered territory was lost again, raising questions about whether the campaigns were worth their terrible price[^132].

Justinian's religious policies created lasting divisions within Christianity rather than resolving them, alienating both Monophysites and orthodox Christians through heavy-handed interventions like the Three Chapters Controversy[^133]. His persecution of non-Christians and heretics demonstrated intolerance that destroyed ancient intellectual traditions, most notably the closure of the Academy at Athens[^134]. His treatment of Pope Vigilius—holding the pontiff against his will and forcing his acquiescence—demonstrated ecclesiastical tyranny that damaged relations between Constantinople and Rome[^135].

Economically, critics point to the crushing tax burden Justinian imposed to fund his wars and building projects, impoverishing many subjects and creating resentment throughout the empire[^136]. The rigorous financial exactions made Byzantine rule deeply unpopular in reconquered territories[^137]. Even his own court historian Procopius, in the _Secret History_, accused him of deliberately ruining the empire through arbitrary legal decisions, corruption, and overtaxation[^138].

The Justinianic Plague, while not Justinian's fault, occurred during his reign and potentially undermined his other achievements through demographic and economic devastation[^139]. Some scholars argue that the combination of plague, warfare, and taxation created a crisis that weakened the empire precisely when it needed strength to face emerging threats[^140].

From this critical perspective, Justinian was an ambitious autocrat whose grandiose vision exceeded his empire's resources, leaving Byzantium exhausted and vulnerable despite superficial territorial gains and cultural achievements[^141]. The debate between these positive and negative assessments continues, with modern historians recognizing both Justinian's genuine accomplishments and the significant costs of his ambitious policies[^142].
