## Summary

Edson Arantes do Nascimento (1940-2022), known as Pelé, was a Brazilian professional footballer regarded by many as the greatest player in the history of the sport. Over a 21-year career mostly with Santos FC, Pelé scored over 1,000 official goals and won three FIFA World Cups (1958, 1962, 1970)—the only player ever to achieve this. His combination of skill, athleticism, creativity, and scoring ability revolutionized football. Beyond statistics, Pelé transcended sport to become a global ambassador for Brazil and for football itself, nicknamed "O Rei" (The King). His death in 2022 prompted worldwide mourning.
