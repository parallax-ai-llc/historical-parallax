## Summary

Wallace Broecker is credited with coining the term 'global warming' in a 1975 paper and discovered the ocean conveyor belt — the global thermohaline circulation pattern that distributes heat around the planet. His work on ocean chemistry and climate showed how disruptions to ocean circulation could trigger abrupt climate change.
