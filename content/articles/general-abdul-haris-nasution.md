## Summary

General Abdul Haris Nasution (1918-2000) was one of Indonesia's most influential military leaders, serving as the chief architect of the Indonesian independence war against the Dutch and twice as Army Chief of Staff. He authored *Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare* (1953), one of the most studied works on guerrilla strategy alongside Mao Zedong's writings, and developed the controversial "Middle Way" doctrine that justified military involvement in Indonesian politics. Narrowly escaping assassination during the 1965 coup attempt in which his daughter was killed, Nasution initially supported Suharto's rise to power but later became a prominent critic of the New Order regime. His complex legacy encompasses both his heroic role in Indonesian independence and his contribution to military authoritarianism.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Abdul Haris Nasution was born on December 3, 1918, in the village of Hutapungkut, Mandailing Natal Regency, North Sumatra, into a devout Muslim Mandailing Batak family.[^1][^4] He was the second child and oldest son in his family. His father was a trader who sold textiles, rubber, and coffee and was an active member of Sarekat Islam (Islamic Union), a pro-independence movement that shaped young Nasution's nationalist consciousness.[^5][^6] The Mandailing are a sub-group of the Batak people who were converted to Islam in the early 19th century during the Minangkabau Padri reign, making them a Muslim minority within the predominantly Christian Batak population.[^7]

His family background created early tensions about his educational path. His very religious father wanted him to study at a religious school, while his mother preferred he study medicine in Batavia (now Jakarta).[^5] After graduating from primary school in 1932, Nasution received a scholarship to study teaching at Bukitinggi, a prestigious opportunity that set him on a different course. In 1935, he moved to Bandung to continue his studies at a teachers' college, where he remained for three years.[^1][^8]

Following his graduation in 1937, Nasution returned to Sumatra and taught in Bengkulu, where he lived near the house where independence leader Sukarno was living in exile. This proximity to Sukarno proved formative—Nasution occasionally spoke with the future president and heard him give speeches, experiences that deepened his nationalist sentiments.[^1][^9] During this period, Nasution became increasingly aware of the Indonesian independence movement and the injustices of colonial rule, seeds that would later flower into his military and political career.

In 1940, seeking military training unavailable to most Indonesians under colonial rule, Nasution applied to join the officer reserve corps, the only avenue for native Indonesians to obtain formal military education. He was accepted and sent to the Bandung Military Academy for training, one of only a handful of Indonesians granted this opportunity.[^1][^10] In September 1940, he was promoted to corporal, and three months later to sergeant. Following his graduation, he was commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL), becoming one of the few indigenous officers in the colonial military structure.[^1][^11]

## Rise to Power

Nasution's rise to military prominence began during the tumultuous period of Japanese occupation and Indonesian independence. In 1942, when the Japanese invaded and occupied the Dutch East Indies, Nasution was stationed in Surabaya, having been posted there to defend the port against the invasion.[^1][^12] The swift Japanese victory ended Dutch colonial military control in early March 1942, when KNIL forces surrendered. Nasution found his way back to Bandung and went into hiding, later performing both civil and military services during the occupation, including helping Japanese-backed PETA (Defenders of the Homeland) militias by carrying messages.[^13]

After the Indonesian proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945, Nasution immediately joined the fledgling Indonesian Army, then known as the People's Security Army (Tentara Keamanan Rakyat or TKR). In May 1946, at just 27 years old, he was appointed Regional Commander of the Siliwangi Division, which was responsible for security in West Java.[^1][^14] This appointment proved crucial to his development as a military strategist and leader. The Siliwangi Division, named after the legendary Sundanese king, would become one of Indonesia's most prestigious military units under his command.

Nasution's strategic genius became evident during the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949). When conventional warfare against the better-equipped Dutch forces proved impossible, he advocated for guerrilla tactics. In June 1948, at a commanders' meeting, his suggestion that the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) should fight guerrilla warfare against the Dutch was approved.[^15] As he acknowledged, Indonesian forces opted for guerrilla warfare out of pragmatism, as they could not establish a modern force equal to the Dutch.[^16] When the Dutch attacked Yogyakarta in December 1948, Nasution, together with TNI and other commanders, retreated into the countryside to wage a guerrilla campaign.

In January 1948, the Renville Agreement divided Java between Dutch and Indonesian-controlled territories. Because West Java fell under Dutch control, Nasution was forced to lead the legendary "Long March" of the Siliwangi Division across to Central Java and into Indonesian-controlled territory—a strategic retreat that preserved his forces and demonstrated his leadership under pressure.[^17] By 1948, Nasution had risen to Deputy TNI Commander, and following the final achievement of independence in 1949, he became Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army, a position he first held from 1949 to 1952.[^1][^18]

## Major Achievements

Nasution's contributions to Indonesian military doctrine and national defense remain his most enduring achievements. His seminal work, *Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare* (*Pokok-pokok Gerilya dan Pertahanan Republik Indonesia di Masa Lalu dan Yang Akan Datang*), first published in 1953, developed into one of the most studied works on guerrilla warfare globally, alongside writings by Mao Zedong and Che Guevara.[^19][^20] Based on his experiences during the Indonesian War of Independence, the book set out principles including the organization of small mobile units, the use of terrain and population support, and the combination of military and political aspects in resisting a superior power.[^16]

Beyond his writings, Nasution developed the theory of territorial warfare (*perang teritorial*), which became the Indonesian Army's foundational defense doctrine.[^17] This concept emphasized territorial defense involving both military and civilian participation, with regional commanders responsible for security in their areas. The doctrine reflected Nasution's belief that Indonesia's vast archipelago required a decentralized defense strategy that integrated military forces with local populations, making the entire nation a potential battlefield against external aggression.

During his second appointment as Army Chief of Staff (1955-1962), Nasution implemented significant military reforms and modernization programs. He was promoted to Major General upon his reappointment in 1955 by the Cabinet of Burhanuddin Harahap, after three years of exile following the October 17 Affair.[^1][^21] As both Army Chief of Staff and Minister of Defense and Security in Sukarno's Cabinet, Nasution wielded enormous influence over Indonesian security policy during a critical period of nation-building.[^1]

Perhaps most controversially, Nasution originated the concept of the military's "dual function" (*dwifungsi ABRI*). Speaking at the anniversary of the Military Academy in Magelang, Central Java, on November 13, 1958, Nasution articulated what he called the "Middle Way"—arguing that the Indonesian military should not be under complete civilian control, but also should not dominate the country as a military dictatorship.[^22][^23] According to this concept, the military had both a defense/security function and a socio-political function. This doctrine allowed military officers to occupy strategic civilian positions such as governor, minister, director general, and parliament members.[^24]

Nasution's Middle Way concept was later renamed *dwifungsi* and became the ideological foundation for military involvement in Indonesian politics during Suharto's New Order regime (1966-1998). Through this doctrine and the political vehicle Golkar, the military was able to enmesh itself into all levels of Indonesian society, with active officers holding key government positions.[^25] While Nasution envisioned this as a balanced approach preventing both civilian interference and military dictatorship, critics would later argue it enabled decades of authoritarian rule.

In recognition of his military service, Nasution received numerous awards including the Star of the Republic of Indonesia 2nd Class (Bintang Republik Indonesia Adipradana), the Bintang Mahaputera, and designation as a National Hero of Indonesia.[^26] Foreign governments also honored him with prestigious decorations including Germany's Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (1963), the Netherlands' Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau (1971), Thailand's Knight Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant (1960), and Ethiopia's Grand Cross and Collar of the Order of the Holy Trinity (1968).[^26] On October 5, 1997, he was given the honorary rank of *Jenderal Besar* (Great General), a rank shared only with Suharto and Sudirman.[^26]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his military achievements, Nasution's career was marked by significant controversies that complicated his legacy. The most dramatic was the October 17, 1952 Affair, an event that nearly amounted to a military coup. By mid-1952, tensions had escalated between the Indonesian Army's high command and parliament over civilian interference in military affairs, particularly regarding plans to demobilize 80,000 out of 200,000 soldiers to conserve budgets.[^27][^28] The plan was deeply unpopular among rank-and-file soldiers facing discharge and traditional officers.

On October 17, 1952, Nasution and fellow general Simatupang mobilized their troops in a massive show of force. Approximately 5,000 people gathered by 8 AM, broke into the parliament building, smashed chairs, and damaged the cafeteria. By the time the crowd reached Merdeka Palace, it had swelled to some 30,000 people, with the army positioning tanks and artillery pieces aimed at the presidential palace.[^29] Nasution later admitted in his memoirs that the Army did not intend to carry out a coup but only tried to warn parliament not to interfere in the Army's internal affairs.[^30]

President Sukarno personally intervened, coming out of the palace to convince soldiers and civilians to disperse. Nasution and Simatupang had been defeated. In December 1952, both lost their positions in the armed forces and were suspended from service.[^31] Nasution would spend the next three years in professional exile before being reappointed as Army Chief of Staff in October 1955. The episode demonstrated both his willingness to use military force for political ends and the limits of military power when confronting legitimately constituted civilian authority.

More controversially, Nasution played a direct role in establishing authoritarian governance under Sukarno's Guided Democracy. In March 1957, he proposed that Sukarno declare martial law across the nation, which the president accepted on March 14, 1957, after Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo's cabinet resigned.[^32][^33] In July 1959, Nasution proposed returning to the 1945 Constitution, which concentrated power in the presidency, and Sukarno quickly endorsed this idea as it better suited implementing his authoritarian Guided Democracy system.[^34]

Most dramatically, during the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly General Session in May 1963, Nasution had Indonesian National Party and Army members present put forward the motion that Sukarno be appointed president for life, with the rationale that without elections, the Communist Party would not be able to gain power. The motion was carried and Sukarno became president for life.[^35] This action fundamentally undermined Indonesian democracy and concentrated power in ways that would enable authoritarianism for decades.

Nasution's formulation of the "Middle Way" doctrine, while intended as a balanced approach, became the ideological foundation for military authoritarianism during the New Order. Critics argue that by legitimizing military involvement in politics and civilian affairs, Nasution helped create the structures that enabled Suharto's repressive 32-year dictatorship.[^36] The doctrine justified military officers occupying positions from cabinet ministers to village administrators, creating a parallel military power structure that undermined civilian democratic institutions.

His relationship with the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was complex and contradictory. While Nasution was strongly opposed to PKI participation in government and was known as a fierce anti-communist, he also participated in structures that concentrated power in ways that ultimately led to the mass killings of suspected communists following the 1965 coup attempt.[^37] Though Nasution himself was targeted for assassination during the coup, some scholars have questioned the military's subsequent role in orchestrating mass violence against communist sympathizers.

## Personal Life

Abdul Haris Nasution was married to Johanna Sunarti (1923-2010), who was known as a humanitarian.[^5] The couple had two daughters: Hendriyanti Sahara and Ade Irma Suryani. Their family life was tragically marked by the events of October 1, 1965, during the coup attempt by the 30 September Movement (G30S/PKI).

On the morning of October 1, 1965, around 4:00 AM, soldiers arrived at Nasution's house to kidnap or kill him as part of a coordinated attack on seven anti-communist Army officers.[^38][^39] When Nasution opened the door, the soldiers shot at him. He fell to the floor, and his wife Johanna locked the door, then pushed him through another door down a corridor. Nasution ran across his garden and climbed over a wall into the neighboring Iraqi ambassador's garden, breaking his ankle as he fell.[^40]

In the chaos of his escape, tragedy struck. His five-year-old daughter, Ade Irma Suryani Nasution, was fatally shot by the attackers.[^41] Additionally, his aide, First Lieutenant Pierre Tendean, was captured and killed, mistaken for Nasution in the darkened house.[^42][^43] Tendean was brought to Lubang Buaya along with six captured high-ranking army officers, where he was shot to death and his body thrown into an old well. The bodies were recovered on October 4, 1965, and buried in a state funeral on October 5, Armed Forces Day.[^44] President Sukarno named Pierre Tendean a national hero for his sacrifice.

Nasution continued hiding in the Iraqi ambassador's garden until 6 AM, when he returned to his house with his broken ankle. He was then taken to the Ministry of Defense and Security, where he sent a message to Major General Suharto at Army Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad) headquarters, informing him that he was alive and safe. After learning that Suharto was taking command of the army, Nasution ordered him to find President Sukarno's whereabouts, contact other military commanders, and secure Jakarta.[^45]

The trauma of losing his daughter and the near-death experience profoundly affected Nasution. His wife Johanna lived another 45 years after the incident, passing away in 2010 at age 87.[^5] The Nasution family home where these events occurred has been preserved as the General Abdul Haris Nasution Museum in Jakarta, commemorating both the general's life and the tragic events of that night.[^46]

Colleagues and contemporaries described Nasution as a man who strictly separated official duties from personal and family matters, staying far from corruption and abuse of authority.[^47] He was known as "Bapak TNI Angkatan Darat" (Father of the Indonesian Army) for his foundational role in building the institution. As a devout Muslim from the Mandailing Batak community, Nasution represented the intersection of Islamic faith and Indonesian nationalism that characterized many independence-era leaders.[^7]

During periods of forced political inactivity, particularly after being sidelined by Suharto, Nasution expressed his thoughts through writing, producing books on military and political themes. He was described as not just a military commander but also an organizer, writer, and strategic thinker who believed deeply in principled governance rooted in Indonesia's independence struggle.[^48]

## Legacy

Abdul Haris Nasution died on September 6, 2000, in Jakarta after suffering a stroke and falling into a coma.[^1][^49] He was buried with full military honors at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery in South Jakarta, the national cemetery for Indonesian heroes and military personnel.[^50] His death marked the end of an era—he was among the last surviving senior leaders of Indonesia's independence struggle.

Nasution's legacy remains deeply contested in Indonesian historiography. On one hand, he is widely celebrated as the chief architect of Indonesia's independence war against the Dutch and one of the founding fathers of the Indonesian military.[^2][^3] His guerrilla warfare theories influenced military thinking not just in Indonesia but globally, and his book *Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare* continues to be studied in military academies worldwide.[^19][^20] The Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) podcast series honored him as the "Insurgent Founder of the Indonesian Army," recognizing his pivotal role in creating a national military force from revolutionary fighters.[^51]

His contributions to Indonesian military doctrine, particularly the concept of territorial warfare, shaped how Indonesia conceived of national defense for generations. The idea that the entire archipelago and its population formed an integrated defense system reflected Nasution's strategic brilliance and his understanding of Indonesia's unique geographic and demographic characteristics.[^17] Military scholars continue to study his adaptation of guerrilla warfare principles to Indonesia's specific conditions.

However, Nasution's legacy is equally defined by his role in establishing structures that enabled military authoritarianism. His "Middle Way" doctrine, which became *dwifungsi* (dual function), provided the ideological justification for military involvement in civilian affairs that characterized Indonesian politics from the 1950s through the 1990s.[^22][^23][^25] Critics argue that while Nasution may have envisioned a balanced approach, the doctrine in practice enabled military officers to occupy civilian positions from cabinet ministers to village heads, undermining democratic institutions and enabling corruption and human rights abuses during the New Order era.

Scholars have described Nasution as "Indonesia's most prominent political enigma," reflecting the contradictions in his career.[^52] He helped establish authoritarian structures under Sukarno's Guided Democracy, including proposing martial law and supporting Sukarno's appointment as president for life.[^32][^35] Yet after being sidelined by Suharto, he became a prominent critic of the very authoritarianism he had helped create. His signing of the Petition of Fifty in 1980, which criticized Suharto's abuse of state ideology Pancasila, demonstrated his willingness to oppose military dictatorship when it became oppressive.[^53][^54]

A museum dedicated to his life and the events of October 1, 1965, operates in his former residence in Jakarta, preserving his memory for future generations.[^46] The museum contains artifacts from his military career, personal belongings, and documentation of the assassination attempt that killed his daughter and aide. It serves as both a memorial to Nasution's contributions and a reminder of the violence that marked Indonesia's political transitions.

In contemporary Indonesia, Nasution is generally remembered as a national hero and founding father of the Indonesian military. His designation as a National Hero of Indonesia and his honorary rank of *Jenderal Besar* reflect official recognition of his contributions.[^26] However, academic and public discussions about his legacy continue to grapple with the contradictions between his role in independence and his contributions to authoritarian structures. The debate over *dwifungsi* and military involvement in politics, which Nasution originated, remains relevant as Indonesia continues consolidating its democracy decades after the fall of the New Order regime.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly literature consistently recognizes Nasution as "a seminal figure in modern Indonesian history" whose contributions to military strategy and national independence were foundational.[^52] Academic research identifies him as instrumental in the formation and modernization of the Indonesian National Army (TNI), with his leadership from 1945 to 1966 shaping the institution's character and capabilities.[^55] Military historians praise his adaptation of guerrilla warfare theory to Indonesian conditions, with his book *Fundamentals of Guerrilla Warfare* remaining a classic text studied alongside Mao Zedong's military writings.[^19][^20]

Scholars like Supriyatmono place Nasution as a critical military figure who was actively involved in the political constellation of the 1950s, helping navigate Indonesia through the turbulent transition from colonial rule to independence.[^56] His role in developing civil-military relations during this period, particularly his formulation of the "middle way" concept, is seen by some scholars as an attempt to find a uniquely Indonesian solution to the challenge of military professionalism in a newly independent nation.[^57] Barry Turner's book *A.H. Nasution and Indonesia's Elites* examines how Nasution helped mobilize "people's resistance" during the War of Independence and shaped postwar politics.[^58]

Defenders of Nasution's legacy emphasize his personal integrity, noting that he separated official duties from personal matters and stayed far from the corruption that characterized many military leaders of his era.[^47] His later opposition to Suharto's New Order regime, particularly his role in the Petition of Fifty, demonstrates that he remained committed to principled governance rooted in Indonesia's independence struggle, even when it cost him power and privilege.[^54] His refusal to submit to demands for explicit loyalty oaths or endorsements of Suharto's authoritarian policies preserved his moral standing among reform-minded Indonesians.

Indonesian nationalist historiography often portrays Nasution as a hero who nearly sacrificed his life for the nation, survived an assassination attempt in which his daughter and aide were killed, and continued serving Indonesia even after political marginalization.[^38][^41] This narrative emphasizes his resilience, patriotism, and dedication to Indonesian independence and sovereignty. The fact that he received numerous international honors from countries including Germany, the Netherlands, Thailand, and Ethiopia reflects his international stature as a military leader and statesman.[^26]

### Negative Views

Critics of Nasution's legacy focus primarily on his role in establishing authoritarian structures that undermined Indonesian democracy. His formulation of the "Middle Way" doctrine, which became *dwifungsi*, is seen as providing ideological justification for military interference in civilian affairs that enabled decades of authoritarian rule under Suharto.[^22][^23][^36] Political scientists argue that while Nasution may have intended a balanced approach, the doctrine in practice allowed the military to dominate Indonesian politics, economics, and society, preventing the development of genuine democratic institutions.

The October 17, 1952 Affair remains controversial, with critics viewing it as an attempted military coup or at minimum an improper use of military force for political purposes.[^27][^29][^30] While Nasution claimed the demonstration was merely a warning to parliament not to interfere in military affairs, the deployment of 30,000 people, tanks, and artillery aimed at the presidential palace suggests a more serious challenge to civilian authority. This episode demonstrated Nasution's willingness to use military power to resist democratic civilian control, setting a dangerous precedent for civil-military relations.

Nasution's support for authoritarian governance under Sukarno is particularly problematic. His proposal for martial law in 1957, his support for returning to the 1945 Constitution to concentrate presidential power, and especially his role in having Sukarno appointed president for life in 1963 all contributed to dismantling Indonesia's nascent democracy.[^32][^34][^35] Critics argue these actions cannot be excused as pragmatic responses to political instability—they represented fundamental betrayals of democratic principles.

Academic studies examining Nasution's trajectory from glory to political marginalization note the irony that he was eventually sidelined by the very authoritarian structures he helped create.[^59] His forced retirement in 1971 at age 53, two years before the normal retirement age, and his withdrawal from military service after signing the Petition of Fifty, demonstrate how Suharto used the military political structures Nasution had legitimized to silence critics.[^60] Some scholars suggest that Nasution's later opposition to the New Order, while admirable, came too late to undo the damage his earlier support for military political involvement had caused.

Human rights advocates note that while Nasution himself opposed Suharto's worst excesses, the *dwifungsi* doctrine he created facilitated military human rights abuses throughout the New Order period. The territorial command structure, which Nasution developed, gave military commanders extensive power over civilian populations, enabling surveillance, intimidation, and violence against political opponents, labor activists, and ethnic minorities. The doctrine's legacy continues to complicate civil-military relations in democratic Indonesia decades after the New Order's fall.

Critics also question Nasution's role in the aftermath of the 1965 coup attempt. While he was clearly a victim, having lost his daughter and narrowly escaped death, his immediate actions helped facilitate Suharto's rise and the subsequent mass killings of suspected communists.[^45] Nasution lobbied Sukarno to appoint Suharto as Army Commander, and while he may not have foreseen the resulting violence, some scholars argue he bears partial responsibility for empowering the military leadership that orchestrated or enabled the mass killings that followed.
