## Summary

Achmad Soebardjo Djojoadisoerjo (23 March 1896 – 15 December 1978) was an Indonesian diplomat, lawyer, and statesman who served as Indonesia's first Minister of Foreign Affairs immediately following the proclamation of independence on 17 August 1945.[^1] A founding father of the Indonesian Republic, he played a pivotal role in mediating the Rengasdengklok incident, drafting the proclamation text, and shaping the nation's constitutional foundations.[^2] Educated at Leiden University, Soebardjo was a multilingual intellectual and skilled negotiator who helped navigate the delicate transition from Japanese occupation to independence.[^3] In 2009, he was posthumously declared a National Hero of Indonesia for his exceptional contributions to the nation's birth and early diplomatic establishment.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Achmad Soebardjo was born Abdul Manaf on 23 March 1896 in Teluk Jambe, Karawang Regency, West Java, as the youngest of four children.[^5] His father, Teuku Muhammad Yusuf, descended from Acehnese aristocracy in Pidie and worked as chief of police in Teluk Jambe.[^6] His mother, Wardinah, was of mixed Javanese-Bugis descent, with her father serving as a camat (district head) in Cirebon.[^7] The multiethnic heritage of his family reflected the diverse cultural tapestry of colonial Indonesia and would later influence his inclusive nationalist vision.

Initially, his father gave him the Acehnese name Teuku Abdul Manaf, while his mother called him Achmad Subardjo.[^8] The surname "Djojoadisoerjo" was added later during his imprisonment following the July 3, 1946 incident.[^9] His siblings included Siti Chadijah, Siti Alimah, and Aburakhman.[^10] Growing up in a religiously observant household with an ulama grandfather, Soebardjo received both Islamic and Western education, a duality that would characterize his intellectual development.[^11]

Soebardjo attended Hogere Burgerschool (HBS) Jakarta, completing his secondary education in 1917.[^12] This Dutch-language institution provided him access to advanced education typically reserved for Europeans and a small elite of indigenous Indonesians. The HBS curriculum emphasized European humanities, sciences, and languages, equipping Soebardjo with the intellectual tools he would later employ in nationalist organizing and diplomacy.[^13]

In pursuit of higher education, Soebardjo traveled to the Netherlands to study law at Leiden University, one of Europe's most prestigious institutions.[^14] He earned his Meester in de Rechten (Master of Laws) degree in 1933, specializing in international and constitutional law.[^15] During his years in Leiden, Soebardjo immersed himself in European political thought, classical music, and languages, eventually mastering nine languages including French, German, Greek, Latin, Dutch, English, Indonesian, Sundanese, and Acehnese.[^16] A colleague later described him as having bohemian sensibilities, enjoying classical music, playing the violin, and smoking cigars—a cosmopolitan intellectual who bridged Eastern and Western cultures.[^17]

## Rise to Prominence

Soebardjo's political awakening occurred during his student years in the Netherlands, where he became deeply involved in Indonesian nationalist organizations. He joined Jong Java, a Javanese youth organization, and more significantly, became an active member of Perhimpoenan Indonesia (Indonesian Association), the nationalist student organization that advocated for complete independence from Dutch colonial rule.[^18] This organization, though small in membership, wielded considerable intellectual influence and produced many of Indonesia's future leaders.[^19]

In 1927, Mohammad Hatta served as chairman of Perhimpoenan Indonesia, with Achmad Soebardjo as secretary, Mohamad Nazif as treasurer, and Nazir Pamontjak and Arnold Mononutu as members.[^20] This leadership cohort transformed Perhimpoenan Indonesia into a more radical organization, shifting from advocating autonomy within the Dutch empire to demanding complete independence.[^21] Soebardjo and his colleagues published Indonesia Merdeka (Free Indonesia), a journal that articulated anti-colonial arguments and circulated throughout the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies.[^22]

In February 1927, Soebardjo, Mohammad Hatta, and three other Indonesian students represented their nation at the founding congress of the League Against Imperialism and Colonial Oppression in Brussels.[^23] This historic gathering brought together 175 delegates from 37 colonized nations, including prominent figures such as Jawaharlal Nehru from India and representatives from African and Asian liberation movements.[^24] The congress created a transnational network of anti-imperialist activists and provided Indonesian nationalists with international legitimacy and solidarity.[^25]

Following the Brussels congress, Soebardjo moved to Berlin for several months, where he befriended the Indian revolutionary Virendranath Chattopadhyaya and worked for the International Secretariat of the League Against Imperialism.[^26] He attended another congress of the League in mid-1927 and temporarily took over leadership of Perhimpoenan Indonesia during this period.[^27] These experiences in European radical politics exposed Soebardjo to Marxist theory, anti-colonial organizing strategies, and the global dimensions of the independence struggle.[^28]

Upon returning to Indonesia in 1934 after completing his legal studies, Soebardjo established himself as a practicing lawyer.[^29] Shortly after his return, he married Raden Ayu Poedji Astuti, daughter of the regent of Kebumen, connecting him to Java's priyayi (aristocratic) class.[^30] His legal practice in Jakarta brought him into contact with nationalist leaders and provided him financial independence, allowing him to continue his political activities during the increasingly repressive final years of Dutch colonial rule.[^31]

## Role in Indonesian Independence

When Japan invaded and occupied the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Soebardjo, like many Indonesian nationalists, saw an opportunity to advance the independence cause.[^32] He joined the Japanese military occupation government, a decision that would later attract criticism from non-collaborationist nationalists like Sutan Sjahrir.[^33] However, Soebardjo and other collaborators argued that working within the Japanese system allowed them to prepare organizational and governmental structures for eventual independence.[^34]

In 1942, Soebardjo and his family moved into a house in Cikini (Jalan Cikini Raya 80-82) previously owned by a Dutch resident who had been arrested by Japanese forces.[^35] This house would later become the first headquarters of Indonesia's Foreign Ministry and remains a historically significant site in Jakarta.[^36]

In 1945, as Japan's military position deteriorated, the occupation authorities established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPKI) to prepare for Indonesian self-governance.[^37] Soebardjo was appointed to this committee, which included 62 members representing various regions, ethnicities, and religious communities.[^38] Within BPUPKI, Soebardjo became a member of the nine-man subcommittee (Panitia Sembilan) tasked with drafting the constitutional preamble.[^39]

The Committee of Nine comprised two factions: the secular nationalist group of Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Achmad Soebardjo, Mohammad Yamin, and Alexander Andries Maramis; and the Islamic group represented by Abikoesno Tjokrosoejoso, A. Kahar Muzakir, Agus Salim, and Wahid Hasjim.[^40] On 22 June 1945, these nine men produced the Jakarta Charter, a compromise document that incorporated Sukarno's Pancasila philosophy while adding seven words requiring Muslims to follow Islamic law.[^41] Soebardjo, representing the secular nationalist perspective, helped negotiate this delicate balance between those advocating an Islamic state and those favoring a secular republic.[^42]

In his autobiography, Soebardjo claimed credit for proposing the inclusion of anti-colonial and self-determination language in the preamble's first paragraph, which became the opening declaration of Indonesia's constitution.[^43] He also joined a nineteen-man committee that drafted the full constitutional text.[^44] When BPUPKI was dissolved, Soebardjo was added as a special advisor to the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) on 14 August 1945, an appointment made without Japanese knowledge.[^45]

---

## The Rengasdengklok Incident and Proclamation

Soebardjo's most crucial contribution to Indonesian independence came during the dramatic hours of 16-17 August 1945. Following Japan's surrender on 15 August, younger nationalist activists led by figures like Sukarni and Wikana grew impatient with the older generation's cautious approach.[^46] Fearing that Sukarno and Hatta might delay the independence proclamation or compromise with returning Allied forces, these youth leaders kidnapped the two men at approximately 4 AM on 16 August, taking them to Rengasdengklok, a small town east of Jakarta.[^47]

When Soebardjo learned of the kidnapping that morning, he immediately recognized the crisis it posed to the independence movement.[^48] He met with Wikana and other youth leaders in Jakarta, and they agreed that independence should be declared in the capital immediately.[^49] Soebardjo then traveled to Rengasdengklok with Sudiro and Jusuf Kunto to negotiate the leaders' return.[^50]

At Rengasdengklok, Soebardjo encountered Major Subeno of the Pembela Tanah Air (PETA, Defenders of the Homeland), the Japanese-trained Indonesian militia, who was guarding Sukarno and Hatta.[^51] In a moment that would become legendary in Indonesian history, Soebardjo made a personal guarantee to Major Subeno that the proclamation of independence would occur by noon on 17 August at the latest, stating that if he failed, he was willing to be shot dead.[^52] This dramatic pledge succeeded in convincing Major Subeno, and Soebardjo secured the release of Sukarno and Hatta, bringing them back to Jakarta by evening.[^53]

Once in Jakarta, Soebardjo facilitated a meeting at the residence of Japanese Rear Admiral Tadashi Maeda at approximately 11 PM on 16 August.[^54] Maeda, sympathetic to Indonesian independence, willingly provided his house as a safe location for composing the proclamation text.[^55] Throughout the night and early morning of 17 August, Sukarno, Hatta, and Soebardjo—along with other nationalist leaders and Japanese military staff including Maeda and Shigetada Nishijima—worked on drafting the proclamation.[^56]

Soebardjo and Hatta verbally contributed their ideas and suggestions, while Sukarno wrote down the text on paper.[^57] Soebardjo later claimed he contributed the phrasing "We, the People of Indonesia, hereby declare our independence," which became the opening line of the proclamation.[^58] The final text, simple yet powerful, was completed in the early hours of 17 August and proclaimed later that morning at Sukarno's residence, marking the birth of the Indonesian Republic.[^59]

## First Foreign Minister

On 19 August 1945, two days after the proclamation, President Sukarno appointed Soebardjo as Minister of Foreign Affairs in Indonesia's first cabinet, making him the nation's inaugural top diplomat.[^60] Soebardjo immediately established the Foreign Ministry headquarters at his own residence on Jalan Cikini Raya, operating from the garage and surrounding rooms.[^61] With no infrastructure, staff, or diplomatic precedents to follow, Soebardjo had to build Indonesia's foreign service from nothing.[^62]

His two-month tenure focused on recruiting the ministry's first staff, establishing basic operational procedures, and attempting to secure international recognition for the newly proclaimed republic.[^63] However, Soebardjo's influence rapidly waned due to the rising prominence of Sutan Sjahrir, who represented a different nationalist faction and advocated a diplomatic rather than confrontational approach to the returning Dutch colonial forces.[^64] In November 1945, Sjahrir became both Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, effectively replacing Soebardjo.[^65]

The rivalry between Soebardjo and Sjahrir reflected deeper divisions within the nationalist movement. Sjahrir had refused to collaborate with the Japanese occupation and criticized those like Soebardjo who had worked within the Japanese system.[^66] Due to this criticism, the Indonesian National Party (PNI) was suspended by August 31, 1945, and a Soebardjo-led informal grouping of former Japanese occupation officials became a major political force.[^67] This factional tension would escalate into open conflict in 1946.[^68]

---

## Controversies and Political Opposition

By mid-1946, many nationalists grew frustrated with Prime Minister Sjahrir's diplomatic negotiations with the Netherlands, which they viewed as too conciliatory.[^69] Prominent revolutionary figures including Tan Malaka, Achmad Soebardjo, and Sukarni believed Sjahrir was too eager to compromise with the Dutch and that his diplomatic approach undermined the republic's sovereignty.[^70] This opposition coalesced around Tan Malaka, a charismatic Marxist revolutionary who had recently returned from exile.[^71]

In late August 1945, Tan Malaka (previously thought dead) had visited Soebardjo, who arranged a secret meeting between Tan Malaka and Sukarno, Hatta, and other leaders.[^72] During this meeting, Sukarno and Hatta indicated that should they be incapacitated or killed, leadership would pass to Tan Malaka, Sjahrir, Iwa Kusumasumantri, and Wongsonegoro.[^73] However, Sjahrir later alleged that Soebardjo failed to inform him of this succession arrangement, creating further mistrust.[^74]

On 4 January 1946, supporters of Tan Malaka formed Persatuan Perjuangan (Unity of Struggle, abbreviated PERSARI), which held its first congress attended by 132 civil organizations, parties, militias, and military groups.[^75] Soebardjo aligned himself with this opposition movement, which demanded more aggressive resistance to Dutch recolonization efforts.[^76]

The conflict escalated dramatically on the night of 27 June 1946, when opposition forces kidnapped Prime Minister Sjahrir.[^77] Soebardjo, along with Mohammad Yamin and Chaerul Saleh, drafted a four-point ultimatum to President Sukarno demanding Sjahrir's dismissal and the appointment of a new cabinet resembling the original September 1945 cabinet dominated by former Japanese collaborators.[^78] On 3 July 1946, Sukarno met with the coup leaders and immediately rejected their demands, dismissing the group's military leader Sudarsono from the military.[^79]

Soebardjo was arrested for his role in what became known as the "July 3, 1946 Incident"—the first attempted coup in the Indonesian Republic's history.[^80] He was imprisoned at Ponorogo Prison and moved between various detention facilities during the remainder of the revolutionary period.[^81] His trial occurred in May 1948, where he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison.[^82] However, President Sukarno granted him amnesty on 17 August 1948, Indonesia's third independence anniversary, allowing his release.[^83]

This episode remains controversial in Indonesian historiography. Supporters argue Soebardjo genuinely believed Sjahrir's diplomatic approach endangered the republic and that more militant resistance was necessary against Dutch recolonization.[^84] Critics contend the kidnapping and coup attempt undermined democratic governance and could have fractured the young republic at its most vulnerable moment.[^85]

## Return to Government and Second Term as Foreign Minister

Following his release, Soebardjo gradually rehabilitated his political reputation. In 1949, he founded the Foreign Affairs Department Academy (Akademi Departemen Luar Negeri, ADLN) to train Indonesia's future diplomats, recognizing the need for professional diplomatic corps.[^86] This institution became crucial for developing Indonesia's foreign service capabilities and represented Soebardjo's lasting contribution to Indonesian diplomacy beyond his ministerial tenures.[^87]

On 26 April 1951, Prime Minister Soekiman Wirjosandjojo appointed Soebardjo as Foreign Minister for a second time, marking his return to the cabinet after his imprisonment.[^88] During this second tenure from 1951 to 1952, Soebardjo achieved significant diplomatic successes but also became embroiled in another major controversy.[^89]

In September 1951, Soebardjo signed the Treaty of San Francisco on behalf of Indonesia, formally ending the state of war with Japan and establishing diplomatic relations.[^90] He also negotiated a $50 million loan with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson and secured Indonesian eligibility for American economic and technical assistance.[^91] These achievements positioned Indonesia within the emerging Cold War aid architecture and provided crucial resources for the young nation's development.[^92]

However, in January 1952, Soebardjo committed Indonesia to accepting aid under the terms of the U.S. Mutual Security Act of 1951 without obtaining prior cabinet approval.[^93] This decision proved highly controversial because the Mutual Security Act included military obligations and was perceived as potentially compromising Indonesian neutrality in the Cold War.[^94] When the cabinet learned of the agreement's terms in February 1952, they instructed Soebardjo to renegotiate, but the Indonesian press had already launched fierce attacks against the Soekiman government over the issue.[^95]

The controversy intensified to the point that parliament passed a motion requiring parliamentary ratification of all future foreign treaties, limiting executive authority in foreign affairs.[^96] Under heavy political pressure and facing intense criticism, Soebardjo resigned as Foreign Minister in February 1952.[^97] The Soekiman Cabinet collapsed shortly thereafter, demonstrating the episode's destabilizing impact.[^98] This resignation marked the end of Soebardjo's ministerial career, though he continued serving in diplomatic and advisory capacities.[^99]

## Later Diplomatic Career

From 1957 to 1961, Soebardjo served as Indonesia's Ambassador to Switzerland, presenting his credentials in September 1957.[^100] During this posting, he led the Indonesian delegation to the first two United Nations Conferences on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) held in Geneva in 1958 and 1960.[^101] This role proved particularly significant given Indonesia's geography as the world's largest archipelagic nation, with over 17,000 islands scattered across vast maritime expanses.[^102]

At the 1958 conference, Soebardjo advanced pioneering arguments for recognizing archipelagic states as a distinct category under international maritime law.[^103] He emphasized Indonesia's geographical realities and the need for legal frameworks that acknowledged the unity of island nations rather than treating each island's waters separately.[^104] This advocacy built upon the Djuanda Declaration of 1957, which had proclaimed Indonesian sovereignty over waters between its islands.[^105]

At the 1960 conference, Soebardjo pushed vigorously for a 12-nautical-mile territorial sea limit and continued advocating for archipelagic state principles.[^106] While these conferences did not immediately achieve all Indonesian objectives, Soebardjo's diplomatic efforts laid groundwork for the eventual recognition of archipelagic state doctrine in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea—a landmark achievement for Indonesia and other maritime nations.[^107]

Soebardjo completed his ambassadorial tenure in May 1961 and returned to Indonesia.[^108] He continued working as an advisor to the Foreign Ministry and lectured at the University of Indonesia's history department, becoming a professor of Constitutional History and Diplomacy of the Republic of Indonesia in the Faculty of Letters.[^109] His academic work helped establish Indonesian diplomatic history as a field of study and trained a new generation of scholars and practitioners.[^110]

In 1961, Soebardjo received the Satya Lencana Peringatan Perjuangan Kemerdekaan (Medal for the Commemoration of the Independence Struggle), recognizing his contributions to the independence movement.[^111] He continued his advisory role with the Foreign Ministry until retiring in 1968 at age 72.[^112]

## Personal Life

Soebardjo married Raden Ayu Poedji Astuti, daughter of the Kebumen regent, shortly after returning to Indonesia in 1934.[^113] The marriage connected him to Central Java's priyayi aristocracy and provided social standing in traditional Javanese society.[^114] Together they had several children, including their eldest daughter Laksmi Pudjiwati Insia.[^115]

Contemporaries described Soebardjo as having a bohemian personality, quite different from the typical nationalist leader.[^116] Subadio Sastrosatomo, a fellow intellectual, characterized him as cosmopolitan, cultured, and somewhat unconventional.[^117] Soebardjo was passionate about classical music, played the violin, and was known as a cigar smoker—habits acquired during his years in Europe.[^118] His multilingual abilities (speaking nine languages including French, German, Greek, Latin, Dutch, English, Indonesian, Sundanese, and Acehnese) reflected his exceptional intellectual range.[^119]

The Soebardjo residence at Jalan Cikini Raya 80-82 became a gathering place for nationalist intellectuals and foreign visitors during the early independence period.[^120] The house, which had served as the republic's first Foreign Ministry headquarters, represented both Soebardjo's personal history and Indonesia's diplomatic origins.[^121] In 2021, Soebardjo's family announced they were putting the historic house up for sale due to inability to maintain its condition, sparking public debate about preserving independence-era heritage sites.[^122]

Soebardjo maintained friendships with many of Indonesia's founding generation, though his relationships with figures like Sjahrir remained strained due to political conflicts.[^123] His connection with Tan Malaka, the revolutionary Marxist, illustrated his willingness to engage with diverse political perspectives, even when such associations proved politically costly.[^124]

---

## Death and Memorialization

Achmad Soebardjo died on 15 December 1978 at Pertamina Central Hospital in Kebayoran Baru, Jakarta, at the age of 82.[^125] The cause of death was complications from influenza.[^126] He was buried at his vacation home in Cipayung, Bogor, rather than in a state cemetery, reflecting his somewhat peripheral status in the New Order government's nationalist pantheon.[^127]

For three decades after his death, Soebardjo's contributions remained under-recognized, overshadowed by his involvement in the 1946 coup attempt and his conflicts with figures like Sjahrir who were more favorably viewed by later administrations.[^128] However, historical reassessment gradually acknowledged his pivotal role in the independence proclamation, particularly his mediation of the Rengasdengklok crisis and participation in drafting the constitutional foundations.[^129]

In 1973, five years before his death, Soebardjo received the Bintang Mahaputera Adipradana (Star of Mahaputera, 2nd Class), one of Indonesia's highest civilian honors, for his exemplary service in diplomacy and state formation.[^130] Posthumously, he was awarded the Star of the Republic of Indonesia in 1992, further recognizing his contributions.[^131]

On 6 November 2009, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono formally declared Achmad Soebardjo a National Hero of Indonesia (Pahlawan Nasional), the nation's highest honor for historical figures.[^132] This designation came through Presidential Decree and was accompanied by public ceremonies honoring his memory.[^133] The recognition positioned Soebardjo among Indonesia's founding fathers and acknowledged his essential role in the independence struggle despite the controversies of his career.[^134]

In 2016, Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi reflected on Soebardjo's legacy during the Foreign Ministry's anniversary celebrations, stating: "Bapak Achmad Soebardjo's contributions serve as a great inspiration... teaching us how important it was to lay solid foundations for this republic."[^135] This ministerial acknowledgment indicated Soebardjo's rehabilitation in official historical memory and recognition of his diplomatic pioneering.[^136]

---

## Legacy

Achmad Soebardjo's legacy remains complex and multifaceted, reflecting both his undeniable contributions to Indonesian independence and the controversies that marked his political career. His willingness to risk his life by guaranteeing the proclamation's timing during the Rengasdengklok crisis demonstrated exceptional courage and commitment at a decisive historical moment.[^137] Without his mediation, the kidnapping could have resulted in violence, fractured the nationalist movement, or delayed independence with potentially catastrophic consequences.[^138]

As Indonesia's first Foreign Minister, Soebardjo established the institutional foundations for Indonesian diplomacy under extraordinarily challenging circumstances.[^139] Operating from his home's garage with no budget, staff, or diplomatic protocols, he nonetheless created the basic structures that subsequent foreign ministers built upon.[^140] His founding of the Foreign Affairs Department Academy in 1949 provided systematic training for Indonesian diplomats and professionalized the foreign service.[^141]

Soebardjo's advocacy for archipelagic state doctrine at the UN Law of the Sea conferences represented visionary diplomacy that served Indonesia's long-term maritime interests.[^142] The eventual international recognition of archipelagic principles in the 1982 UNCLOS owed much to groundwork laid by Soebardjo and his colleagues in the 1950s and 1960s.[^143] This achievement secured Indonesian sovereignty over vast maritime areas and established legal precedents benefiting other archipelagic nations.[^144]

His role in the Committee of Nine and the drafting of Indonesia's constitutional preamble, including his claimed authorship of the anti-colonial first paragraph, placed him among the constitutional founders.[^145] The compromise between secular and Islamic nationalist factions that produced Pancasila as state ideology relied on negotiations in which Soebardjo participated as a key secular nationalist voice.[^146]

However, Soebardjo's legacy is complicated by his involvement in the 1946 coup attempt against Sjahrir, which represented a betrayal of democratic governance and threatened the young republic's stability.[^147] His collaboration with the Japanese occupation, while tactically justified by many nationalists as necessary for preparing independence, attracted criticism from the non-collaborationist faction and raised questions about accommodation versus resistance.[^148]

The 1952 Mutual Security Act controversy demonstrated Soebardjo's diplomatic limitations—his failure to secure cabinet approval before committing Indonesia to Cold War aid arrangements showed lack of political judgment and understanding of parliamentary democracy's requirements.[^149] This episode contributed to patterns of executive overreach in foreign policy that would later characterize Indonesian authoritarianism.[^150]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and governmental reassessments since the 1990s have increasingly emphasized Soebardjo's positive contributions while contextualizing his controversies within the revolutionary period's complexities.[^151] Historians like Adrian Vickers and Robert Cribb acknowledge that the Rengasdengklok mediation was an act of extraordinary personal courage that potentially saved Indonesia's independence movement from violent fracture.[^152] The guarantee Soebardjo made to Major Subeno—offering his own life if the proclamation failed—represents one of the most dramatic moments in Indonesian independence history.[^153]

Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi's 2016 tribute highlighted Soebardjo's role in establishing diplomatic foundations, noting that his work in 1945 "laid solid foundations for this republic" despite operating with minimal resources.[^154] The ministry has increasingly recognized Soebardjo as a pioneering figure whose institutional creativity enabled Indonesia's early diplomatic successes.[^155]

Legal scholars particularly value Soebardjo's advocacy for archipelagic state doctrine at the UN Law of the Sea conferences, viewing this as strategically brilliant diplomacy that secured Indonesia's maritime sovereignty decades into the future.[^156] Professor Hasjim Djalal, Indonesia's foremost maritime law expert, credited Soebardjo's generation with establishing legal principles that transformed international maritime law and benefited Indonesia immeasurably.[^157]

Soebardjo's multilingual abilities, cosmopolitan education, and intellectual range made him an effective representative of Indonesian nationalism on international stages where credibility and sophistication mattered.[^158] His participation in the 1927 League Against Imperialism congress connected Indonesian nationalism to global anti-colonial movements and established transnational solidarity networks.[^159]

Defenders of Soebardjo's collaboration with Japan argue that nationalists faced impossible choices under occupation and that Soebardjo's participation in Japanese-sponsored bodies like BPUPKI enabled him to shape constitutional frameworks and prepare governmental structures for independence.[^160] Without collaborators providing institutional continuity, Indonesia's transition to independence might have been even more chaotic and vulnerable to Allied reoccupation.[^161]

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize that Soebardjo's involvement in the 1946 coup attempt against Sjahrir represented a serious betrayal of democratic principles and reflected authoritarian tendencies among former Japanese collaborators.[^162] Political scientist Herbert Feith argued that figures like Soebardjo never fully accepted parliamentary democracy and preferred the hierarchical, executive-dominated governance they had experienced under Japanese occupation.[^163] The kidnapping of a democratically appointed prime minister violated constitutional norms and could have triggered civil war.[^164]

The rivalry between Soebardjo and Sjahrir is often interpreted as reflecting deeper divisions between collaborators and non-collaborators, with the former resenting their marginalization by the latter despite having done the "practical work" of preparing independence structures.[^165] However, critics argue that collaboration compromised moral authority and that Sjahrir's faction maintained greater legitimacy precisely because they had resisted rather than accommodated foreign occupation.[^166]

Soebardjo's alignment with Tan Malaka, whose radical Marxism and cult of personality threatened to create authoritarian revolutionary government, raises questions about his political judgment.[^167] Sjahrir's biographer Rudolf Mrázek argued that opposition figures like Soebardjo were willing to sacrifice democratic procedures for nationalist militancy, establishing dangerous precedents for future military interventions in politics.[^168]

The 1952 Mutual Security Act scandal demonstrated problematic executive overreach and disregard for parliamentary oversight.[^169] Critics contend Soebardjo's willingness to commit Indonesia to Cold War military obligations without cabinet approval showed authoritarian tendencies and poor diplomatic judgment.[^170] The controversy contributed to patterns of Foreign Ministry autonomy that reduced democratic accountability in foreign policy.[^171]

Some historians question whether Soebardjo's contributions to the proclamation and constitutional drafting were as significant as he later claimed in his autobiography.[^172] While clearly present at key moments, the extent to which he shaped specific language and ideas remains disputed, with some arguing he exaggerated his role to compensate for political marginalization after 1946.[^173]

Soebardjo's delayed recognition as a National Hero—not declared until 2009, three decades after his death—itself suggests official ambivalence about his legacy and the controversies that complicated straightforward heroic narratives.[^174]
