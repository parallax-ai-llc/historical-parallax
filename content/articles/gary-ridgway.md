## Summary
Gary Leon Ridgway, the 'Green River Killer,' is convicted of 49 murders and confessed to possibly 71 in the Seattle area between 1982 and 1998. The most prolific convicted serial killer in U.S. history, he targeted sex workers along the Pacific Highway, strangling them and dumping bodies near the Green River.

## Early Life
Born on February 18, 1949, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ridgway grew up near Seattle. He served in the Navy during Vietnam, then worked as a truck painter at Kenworth for over 30 years. He was married three times and described a turbulent home life with a domineering mother. [^1]

## Criminal Career
From 1982 onward, Ridgway targeted women involved in sex work along Pacific Highway South near SeaTac Airport. He strangled most victims during or after sex and dumped bodies in wooded areas. He was questioned in 1983 and passed a polygraph in 1984, allowing him to continue for years. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
DNA collected in 1987 was finally matched to Ridgway using new STR technology in 2001. Arrested November 30, 2001, he pleaded guilty to 48 murders (later 49) in exchange for revealing victims' locations. He was sentenced to life without parole in 2003. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His plea deal helped locate remains of missing women, providing closure [^4]
- His case was instrumental in advancing DNA cold case technology
- Led to formation of dedicated serial crime units in Pacific Northwest law enforcement

## Negative Perspectives
- Convicted of 49 murders, possibly committed 71 [^5]
- Targeted marginalized women unlikely to be reported missing
- Evaded capture for nearly two decades despite being an early suspect
- His case highlighted police bias in prioritizing cases involving sex workers
