## Summary

On the day Russia invaded Ukraine, Russians took to the streets in protest. It was arguably the bravest thing they could do—and the most futile. Over 16,000 people were arrested in the first weeks alone. Many were beaten. Some were tortured. New laws made holding a blank piece of paper grounds for arrest. Speaking the word "war" instead of "special military operation" became a crime punishable by 15 years in prison.[^1]

The 2022 anti-war protests in Russia were remarkable not for their size—they never approached the millions who marched in other countries—but for their courage in the face of certain punishment. Protesters knew they would be detained, beaten, possibly imprisoned, certainly tracked forever by a surveillance state. They came out anyway: young people mostly, urban, educated, knowing their country was committing a crime and refusing to be silent.[^2]

The protests failed to stop the war or change policy. Most protesters who could leave did—hundreds of thousands fled Russia. Those who stayed learned to be silent or found themselves in prison. But the protests proved something important: not all Russians supported the invasion. Some were willing to risk everything to say so. In a country where dissent can mean years in a penal colony, even the attempt to protest is a form of heroism.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Putin's Russia

**The security state:**
- Vladimir Putin: President/PM since 2000
- Gradual crackdown on civil society (2012 onwards)
- "Foreign agent" laws
- Independent media eliminated
- Opposition leaders: Poisoned, imprisoned, exiled

**2021:**
- Alexei Navalny imprisoned
- His organization "extremist"
- Last major independent media closed or fled
- Protest effectively criminalized already[^4]

### The Invasion

**February 24, 2022:**
- Russia launched full-scale invasion of Ukraine
- Called "special military operation"
- Using word "war" or "invasion" became illegal

**Russian state narrative:**
- "Denazification"
- NATO expansion threat
- Protecting Russian speakers

**Reality:**
- War of aggression
- War crimes documented
- Massive casualties[^5]

## The Protests

### Day One (February 24, 2022)

**Immediate response:**
- Protests in 51 cities
- **1,391 detained** on first day
- Moscow: 700+ arrested
- St. Petersburg: 340+ arrested

**Who came out:**
- Young (many <30)
- Urban
- Educated
- Not a mass movement but significant

### First Two Weeks (February 24 - March 13)

**Scale of repression:**
- **14,906 detained** (OVD-Info data)
- Beatings in detention
- Torture documented
- Fines, short jail terms, draft threats

**Across the country:**
- 100+ cities saw protests
- Even small towns
- Despite complete media blackout

### Methods of Protest

**What protesters did:**
- Holding blank signs (arrested anyway)
- Flowers at Ukrainian locations (arrested)
- Single-person pickets (legal but arrested)
- Online posts (criminal charges)

**State response:**
- Any gathering = arrest
- Any sign = arrest
- Any statement = investigation
- Even silence interpreted as dissent[^6]

### New Laws

**March 4, 2022:**
- Law criminalizing "fake news" about military
- Up to 15 years prison
- Using word "war" = crime
- Criticizing army = crime

**Effect:**
- Independent journalism = crime
- Protest = crime
- Speaking truth = crime

**This wasn't protest suppression. It was the criminalization of reality itself.**[^7]

### September 2022: Mobilization Protests

**September 21, 2022:**
- Putin announced "partial mobilization" (draft)
- New wave of protests
- **1,300+ arrested** in one day
- Moscow: 500+
- St. Petersburg: 524

**But also:**
- Mass exodus began
- 500,000+ fled Russia
- Border queues for days

**Mobilization made war real for more Russians—and many chose to flee rather than fight or protest.**[^8]

## Why Protests Failed

### Overwhelming repression

**The math of repression:**
- Any protest = arrest
- Arrest = beating, fine, possibly prison
- Repeat protest = certain prison
- Every protester tracked digitally

**Simply too dangerous to sustain.**

### No organization allowed

**Opposition destroyed beforehand:**
- Navalny's network dismantled (2021)
- Independent media closed
- Civil society "foreign agents"
- No way to coordinate

### Genuine support for war (partial)

**Polling (questionable but indicative):**
- Majority of Russians said they supported "operation"
- Older, rural, propaganda-exposed
- Hard to know true opinion under repression
- But anti-war protesters were a minority

### Those who could, left

**Emigration:**
- 500,000-1,000,000 left 2022
- Disproportionately young, educated, urban
- The people who would protest left
- "Brain drain" and "dissent drain"[^10]

## Historical Assessment

### Significance

**What the protests showed:**
- Not all Russians supported war
- Some were willing to risk everything
- Courage exists even in totalitarian states
- But courage alone cannot stop repression

### Comparison to USSR

**1968 Red Square protest:**
- 8 people protested Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia
- Arrested immediately
- Famous precisely because it happened despite consequences

**2022:** Thousands did the same—at similar cost.

### The Moral Record

**For history:**
- Russians protested
- Many were beaten, imprisoned
- Some died (Navalny in prison 2024)
- The record exists

**This matters even if it didn't stop the war.**[^11]

## Legacy

### For Russia

- Dissent effectively eliminated
- Those who opposed left or fell silent
- Surveillance state tightened
- But: Record of opposition exists

### For Anti-war Movement

- Exile community continues advocacy
- Diaspora protests continue
- Russian opposition abroad significant

### Memory

- OVD-Info documents every arrest
- Names and faces preserved
- When Russia changes (if it does), they will be remembered[^12]
