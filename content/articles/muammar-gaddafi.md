## Summary
Muammar Gaddafi governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman from 1969 to 1977 and then as the "Brotherly Leader" of the Great Socialist Peoples Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He initially espoused Arab nationalism and socialism but later developed his own ideology, the Third International Theory.

## Civil War
His 42-year rule ended during the Arab Spring in 2011, when a NATO-backed uprising led to his capture and death at the hands of rebel forces in Sirte.
