## Summary

Muammar Muhammad Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi (c. 1942 – October 20, 2011) ruled Libya for 42 years as its revolutionary leader and de facto dictator. Coming to power through a 1969 military coup, Gaddafi promoted his idiosyncratic "Third International Theory" mixing Arab nationalism, Islamic socialism, and anti-Western rhetoric. His rule combined oil wealth distribution with brutal repression, international terrorism sponsorship, and increasingly bizarre personal behavior. Gaddafi's regime ended violently during the 2011 Libyan Civil War when he was captured and killed by rebel forces, leaving Libya in chaos.
