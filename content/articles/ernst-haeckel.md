## Summary

Ernst Haeckel was a German biologist who popularized Darwin's theory in Germany and coined many biological terms including 'ecology,' 'phylum,' 'phylogeny,' and 'stem cell.' He described thousands of new species and produced detailed illustrations of organisms. His recapitulation theory ('ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny'), though later disproven, was influential.
