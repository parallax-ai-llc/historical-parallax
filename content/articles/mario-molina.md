## Summary

Mario Molina was a Mexican chemist who shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his role in discovering the threat of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to the ozone layer. His work with F. Sherwood Rowland demonstrated that CFC gases deplete the stratospheric ozone layer, leading to the Montreal Protocol banning CFCs. He was the first Mexican-born scientist to receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
