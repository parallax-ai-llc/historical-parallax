## Summary

Évariste Galois founded group theory and Galois theory, establishing the conditions under which polynomial equations can be solved by radicals. He made these revolutionary contributions before dying in a duel at age 20. His work, written hastily the night before his death, took decades to be fully understood and became fundamental to modern algebra.
