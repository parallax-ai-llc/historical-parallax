## Summary

John Archibald Wheeler was an American theoretical physicist who coined the terms 'black hole,' 'wormhole,' and 'quantum foam.' He made important contributions to nuclear physics through the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory and the Bohr-Wheeler theory of nuclear fission. Wheeler mentored many prominent physicists including Richard Feynman and Kip Thorne. He was one of the last major physicists to have worked with both Einstein and Bohr.
