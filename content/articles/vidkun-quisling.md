## Summary

Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling (1887-1945) was a Norwegian military officer, politician, and diplomat who became one of history's most infamous traitors through his collaboration with Nazi Germany during World War II.[^1] Despite beginning his career as a humanitarian aid worker and achieving the highest academic scores in Norwegian military history, he founded the fascist Nasjonal Samling party in 1933 and actively urged Hitler to invade Norway.[^2] As head of Norway's puppet government during the German occupation (1942-1945), he was responsible for the deportation of nearly 1,000 Norwegian Jews to concentration camps.[^3] Executed by firing squad in October 1945, his surname became a universal synonym for "traitor" in the English language and Scandinavian languages.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Vidkun Abraham Lauritz Jonssøn Quisling was born on July 18, 1887, in Fyresdal, a rural municipality in Telemark county, Norway.[^5] He was the son of Jon Lauritz Qvisling, a Church of Norway pastor and genealogist, and Anna Caroline Bang, daughter of Jørgen Bang, a wealthy ship-owner who was the richest man in Grimstad at the time.[^6] Growing up in a religious household with two brothers and a sister, young Vidkun was described as "shy and quiet but also loyal and helpful, always friendly, occasionally breaking into a warm smile."[^7]

From 1893 to 1900, his father served as a chaplain for the Strømsø borough in Drammen, where Vidkun attended school for the first time.[^8] His early educational experience was marked by bullying from other students who mocked his Telemark dialect, but he proved to be an exceptionally successful student.[^9] He displayed particular aptitude for history and natural sciences, subjects that would shape his intellectual development.[^10]

The young Quisling's childhood was characterized by the strict moral atmosphere of a Norwegian Lutheran parsonage. His father's work as a genealogist, tracing family lineages and historical connections, may have influenced Vidkun's later obsessions with racial heritage and national identity.[^11] The family moved frequently due to his father's ecclesiastical assignments, exposing Quisling to different communities across Norway and contributing to his developing sense of Norwegian nationalism.[^12]

Despite the challenges of relocation and social adjustment, Quisling excelled academically. His intellectual gifts became evident early, and his family recognized his potential for a distinguished career. The combination of his religious upbringing, academic excellence, and experiences of social isolation would later manifest in his peculiar blend of messianic self-perception and political extremism.[^13]

## Rise to Power

### Military Excellence and Early Career

In 1905, Vidkun Quisling entered the Norwegian Military Academy, achieving the highest entrance examination score among 250 applicants.[^14] This remarkable achievement foreshadowed his subsequent academic triumphs. Transferring to the Norwegian Military College in 1906, he graduated with the highest score since the institution's founding in 1817, an unprecedented accomplishment that earned him a private audience with King Haakon VII of Norway.[^15] His exceptional performance in mathematics and military sciences established his reputation as one of Norway's most brilliant young officers.[^16]

### Diplomatic Service and Humanitarian Work

Quisling's career took an international turn when he served as military attaché to the Soviet Union, with diplomatic posts in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) from 1918-1919 and Helsinki from 1920-1921.[^17] In autumn 1921, he left Norway at the request of the renowned Norwegian explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen.[^18] Arriving in Kharkiv, Ukraine, in January 1922, Quisling joined the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort during the catastrophic Russian famine of 1921.[^19]

Nansen appointed Quisling as head of the Ukraine branch of the relief operation, where he organized aid efforts that saved countless lives.[^20] His work was so impressive that Nansen described it as "absolutely indispensable."[^21] Having left Ukraine in September 1922, Quisling and his first wife Alexandra returned to Kharkiv in February 1923 to prolong aid efforts.[^22] For his humanitarian work in Russia, Quisling was awarded the Romanian Crown Order, the Yugoslav Order of St. Sava, and became a Commander of the Order of the British Empire.[^23]

### Business and Further Diplomatic Work

In May 1926, Quisling found employment with longtime friend Frederik Prytz in Moscow, working as a liaison between Prytz and the Soviet authorities who owned half of Prytz's firm, Onega Wood.[^24] When British diplomatic affairs in Russia were being managed by Norway, he became legation secretary, with his second wife Maria joining him in late 1928.[^25] In 1929, with the British keen to reclaim control of their diplomatic affairs, Quisling left Russia, receiving appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to Britain.[^26]

### Entry into Norwegian Politics

Quisling returned to Norway in 1929 and served as Minister of Defence in the agrarian governments of Peder Kolstad (1931-1932) and Jens Hundseid (1932-1933).[^27] During his tenure, he gained notoriety for repressing a strike by hydroelectrical workers, revealing his authoritarian tendencies.[^28] When the Agrarian Party refused to appoint him as party leader, Quisling left the government in 1933 to form his own political movement.[^29]

On May 17, 1933—Norway's Constitution Day—Quisling founded Nasjonal Samling (National Unity), a fascist political party modeled on Nazi principles.[^30] The party espoused Norwegian nationalism, anti-communism, corporatism, and elements of Lutheranism, while opposing trade unionism and promoting authoritarian governance.[^31] It relied heavily on Nordic symbolism in its propaganda, adopting a golden St. Olav's cross on a red background as its primary symbol.[^32]

Despite Quisling's ambitions, Nasjonal Samling failed to gain popular support. In the 1933 Norwegian parliamentary elections, the party received only 2.2% of the vote.[^33] By 1936, in the last elections before World War II, support had declined further to 1.8%.[^34] The party never won a single seat in the Storting (Norwegian parliament).[^35] As the party developed an increasingly extremist pro-German and anti-Semitic stance, it lost support from its early agrarian power base and the Lutheran state church.[^36]

## Major Achievements

### Academic and Military Distinction

Quisling's most legitimate achievements occurred during his early career. His unprecedented academic performance at the Norwegian Military College—the highest score since 1817—demonstrated exceptional intellectual capability.[^37] This academic excellence, combined with his mathematical aptitude and strategic thinking, initially positioned him as one of Norway's most promising military minds.[^38] His royal audience with King Haakon VII recognized not just academic achievement but suggested a future of national service.[^39]

### Humanitarian Relief Efforts

Quisling's work with Fridtjof Nansen during the Russian famine of 1921 represented genuine humanitarian achievement.[^40] As head of the League of Nations relief operation in Ukraine, he organized aid distribution that helped save thousands of lives during one of history's worst famines.[^41] Nansen's assessment that Quisling's work was "absolutely indispensable" testified to his organizational capabilities and dedication during this period.[^42] The international recognition he received—including honors from Romania, Yugoslavia, and Britain—reflected widespread acknowledgment of his humanitarian contributions.[^43]

### Diplomatic Service

Quisling's diplomatic service in the Soviet Union demonstrated his ability to navigate complex international situations. Managing British diplomatic affairs in Russia while serving as Norwegian legation secretary required diplomatic skill, linguistic ability, and political acumen.[^44] His appointment as Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to Britain indicated that his diplomatic work was valued by foreign governments.[^45]

### Minister of Defence

As Norway's Minister of Defence from 1931 to 1933, Quisling held one of the nation's most important cabinet positions.[^46] Though his tenure was controversial, particularly regarding his suppression of labor strikes, it represented a significant political achievement for someone outside traditional party structures.[^47] His appointment demonstrated that Norway's political establishment initially viewed him as a capable administrator worthy of high office.[^48]

### Political Organization

Founding Nasjonal Samling in 1933 represented organizational achievement, even if the party failed electorally.[^49] Creating a political movement from scratch, developing its ideology, recruiting members, and establishing organizational structures across Norway required considerable effort and administrative skill.[^50] Though the party's fascist ideology and pro-German stance ultimately marginalized it, Quisling successfully maintained organizational coherence until Germany's invasion provided alternative paths to power.[^51]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Betrayal and Collaboration with Nazi Germany

Quisling's most infamous act was his secret meeting with Adolf Hitler on December 14, 1939, where he urged a German occupation of Norway.[^52] Three days earlier, he had informed German Navy Grand Admiral Erich Raeder that he wanted to place Norwegian military bases at Germany's disposal to prevent British intervention.[^53] These meetings directly contributed to Hitler's decision to invade Norway, with the Führer ordering his staff to draw up invasion preparations immediately after meeting Quisling.[^54]

On April 9, 1940, as German forces invaded Norway, Quisling committed what many consider history's first radio-broadcast coup d'état.[^55] He seized control of a radio broadcasting studio and declared himself Prime Minister, ordering Norway's military mobilization to cease.[^56] King Haakon VII refused to recognize a Quisling government, stating he would "sooner abdicate" than appoint any government headed by Quisling.[^57] The coup collapsed within six days, and Nazi leadership forced Quisling to step down on April 15, 1940.[^58]

### Persecution of Norwegian Jews

One of Quisling's gravest crimes was his systematic persecution of Norway's Jewish population. One of his first acts as Minister President was reinstating the "Jewish paragraph" of the Norwegian constitution, which had been removed in 1851 and prevented Jews from settling in Norway.[^59] From October through November 1942, Quisling signed a series of laws enabling the arrest of all Norwegian Jewish men, confiscation of all Jewish-owned property and assets, and registration of all Norwegian Jews.[^60]

On October 26, 1942, German forces, assisted by Norwegian police and members of Hirden (Nasjonal Samling's paramilitary wing), arrested approximately 300 registered Jewish men and interned them in concentration camps.[^61] The first deportation of 532 Jews left Oslo on November 26, 1942, followed by 158 on February 25, 1943.[^62] Between 1940 and 1945, approximately 770 Jews were deported from Norway; only about 34 survived, with most murdered at Auschwitz.[^63] Quisling was held directly responsible for sending nearly 1,000 Jews to their deaths.[^64]

### Church and Education Persecution

In 1942, Quisling attempted to force Norwegian children to join Nasjonal Samlings Ungdomsfylking, a Hitler Youth-inspired organization.[^65] This decree prompted massive resistance from Norway's Church and educational establishment. On Easter Sunday 1942, nearly 11,000 Norwegian clergymen resigned in protest against the Quisling regime, with only about 40 retaining their posts.[^66] All seven bishops of the State Church denounced Quisling's decree and resigned.[^67]

The resistance was led by ex-Primate of Norway Bishop Eivind Berggrav of Oslo. When Quisling summoned Berggrav and accused him of treason, shouting "You triple traitor! You deserve to have your head chopped off," Berggrav courageously replied "Here I am," though Quisling did not follow through.[^68] The mass resignation of teachers and churchmen, along with large-scale civil unrest, forced Quisling to abandon some of his most extreme policies.[^69]

### Puppet Government and German Control

Despite Quisling's title as Minister President from February 1942 to May 1945, he exercised little real power.[^70] Josef Terboven, the German Reichskommissar, maintained actual control, taking orders only from Hitler.[^71] The relationship between Quisling and Terboven was deeply antagonistic; Terboven wanted no role for Nasjonal Samling in government and personally disliked Quisling.[^72] Quisling constantly lobbied Hitler for independence and Terboven's recall, but never succeeded.[^73]

In one dramatic incident, Quisling refused to sign a German demand for the execution of thousands of alleged Norwegian "saboteurs," enraging Terboven, who stormed out of their meeting.[^74] This incident revealed Quisling's limited authority even within his puppet regime. His government was entirely dependent on German military power and lacked legitimacy or popular support.[^75]

## Personal Life

### Family Background and Early Relationships

Vidkun Quisling grew up in a religious household as the son of Church of Norway pastor Jon Lauritz Qvisling and Anna Caroline Bang.[^76] His mother came from a wealthy family—her father was Grimstad's richest man—but the family lived modestly on a pastor's income.[^77] Quisling had two brothers and a sister, and family members described him as shy, quiet, loyal, and helpful, occasionally showing warmth through his smile.[^78]

### First Marriage to Alexandra

While working in Russia, Quisling married Alexandra Andreevna Voronine, a Russian woman who later wrote memoirs titled "In Quisling's Shadow."[^79] Their relationship was complex and ultimately ended, though Alexandra remained part of Quisling's life in unusual ways. In January 1923, when Quisling began a relationship with Maria Pasek, Alexandra initially took on what has been described as a "foster-daughter" role in the household—a highly unconventional arrangement.[^80]

### Second Marriage to Maria

Quisling met Maria Vasilyevna Pasek (born October 10, 1900) in Kharkiv in 1923, and they were formally and informally married in September that year, though some historians doubt whether the couple were legally married.[^81] Maria's background is somewhat uncertain; she told her family-in-law that her father had been a higher civil servant in the Russian Empire.[^82]

For several years, Maria lived in Norway and France, often separated from Vidkun because of his work and travels.[^83] During the German occupation of Norway, she lived with him at Villa Grande from 1941 to 1945, serving as hostess for social gatherings there and at the Royal Palace.[^84] The couple had no children.[^85]

### Personality and Character

Quisling's personality combined intellectual brilliance with profound political misjudgment. His exceptional academic achievements suggested a rational, analytical mind, yet his political career demonstrated grandiose delusions and poor reality assessment.[^86] At his trial, he actively participated in his defense, testifying that he was a "misunderstood prophet" who had acted out of love for Norway.[^87] He spoke for four hours, often digressing into childhood memories and philosophical reflections without addressing the charges against him.[^88]

His contemporaries noted his social awkwardness and difficulty connecting with ordinary Norwegians. This social isolation, combined with his intellectual arrogance, may have contributed to his catastrophic political miscalculations.[^89] He seemed genuinely convinced that collaborating with Nazi Germany would ultimately benefit Norway, a delusion he maintained until his execution.[^90]

### Final Years and Execution

After Norway's liberation in May 1945, Quisling was immediately arrested.[^91] During his imprisonment awaiting trial, he maintained his belief in his righteousness. His last words before execution by firing squad at Akershus Fortress at 2:40 AM on October 24, 1945, were "I'm convicted unfairly and I die innocent."[^92]

Maria Quisling lived in Oslo in seclusion after the war. In 1959, she received an urn with her husband's ashes, which she buried at Gjerpen Church yard in a small ceremony.[^93] She died on January 17, 1980, leaving her assets to a charity fund bearing her and Vidkun's name that annually gives small sums to elderly persons.[^94]

## Legacy

### The Word "Quisling"

Vidkun Quisling's most enduring legacy is linguistic rather than political. The British newspaper The Times coined the term "quisling" in an editorial on April 19, 1940, titled "Quislings everywhere," noting that "they could hardly have hit upon a more brilliant combination of letters" for a word meaning traitor.[^95] Before the end of 1940, the term was being used generically in English to refer to any traitor or collaborator.[^96]

Winston Churchill, George Orwell, and H.G. Wells all used the word in their wartime writings, cementing its place in the English language.[^97] The term spread to Scandinavian languages and beyond, becoming a universal synonym for treason and collaboration.[^98] Outside of Norway, the word "quisling" has outlasted the memory of Vidkun Quisling himself—many English speakers use the term without knowing its origin.[^99]

### Historical Infamy

Since his death, Quisling has been regarded as one of European history's foremost traitors.[^100] His collaboration with Nazi Germany, active encouragement of Norway's invasion, and participation in the Holocaust have made his name synonymous with betrayal.[^101] The fact that he committed what many historians consider the world's first radio-broadcast coup d'état added a dimension of technological innovation to his treachery.[^102]

### Impact on Norwegian Society

Quisling's collaboration left deep scars on Norwegian society. The Norwegian government-in-exile returned from London in 1945 and immediately implemented a comprehensive legal purge of collaborators.[^103] The trials and executions that followed represented Norway's attempt to cleanse itself of the occupation's moral contamination.[^104] Quisling's execution—Norway's first since 1876 and the first since capital punishment was abolished in 1905—required special legal justification.[^105]

The Villa Grande, Quisling's residence during the occupation, became a controversial site. Maria Quisling's burial of his ashes at Gjerpen Church yard in 1959 sparked ongoing debates about how to commemorate—or refuse to commemorate—Norway's most infamous son.[^106] Even decades after his death, conflicts erupt over Quisling's grave and how Norwegian society should remember this dark chapter.[^107]

### Impact on Understanding Collaboration

Quisling's case has become a paradigmatic example for historians studying collaboration in occupied territories. Unlike collaborators who claimed they were forced or had no choice, Quisling actively sought German occupation before Norway was invaded.[^108] His premeditated betrayal provides a clear example of ideologically motivated collaboration, distinguishing him from opportunistic or coerced collaborators.[^109]

### Educational and Memorial Context

In Holocaust education, Quisling's role in deporting Norwegian Jews serves as an important case study of how local collaborators facilitated Nazi genocide.[^110] The fact that only about 1.8% of Norwegians voted for his party before the war, yet he still managed to implement anti-Semitic policies, illustrates how small extremist minorities can wield disproportionate power under occupation.[^111]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

#### Early Humanitarian Contributions

Even Quisling's harshest critics acknowledge his genuine contributions during the Russian famine relief efforts of the early 1920s. Fridtjof Nansen, one of Norway's most respected figures, praised Quisling's work as "absolutely indispensable," and this assessment came from a humanitarian hero known for his integrity and judgment.[^112] Some historians argue that this period reveals Quisling's capacity for genuine service and suggests that his later political evolution represented a tragic corruption of initially altruistic instincts.[^113]

The international recognition Quisling received—honors from Romania, Yugoslavia, and Britain—reflected widespread acknowledgment that his humanitarian work saved lives during one of history's worst famines.[^114] Scholars studying this period note that Quisling's organizational abilities, linguistic skills, and dedication to humanitarian relief were exceptional and should not be entirely erased by his later crimes.[^115]

#### Academic and Intellectual Achievements

Quisling's unprecedented academic performance at the Norwegian Military College remains historically significant. His achievement of the highest score since 1817 demonstrated genuine intellectual brilliance.[^116] Some scholars have examined whether his later political radicalization represented a form of intellectual corruption, wherein exceptional intelligence became detached from moral reasoning and practical wisdom.[^117]

#### Contested Motivations

A minority of scholars have explored whether Quisling genuinely believed his collaboration would benefit Norway. At his trial, he argued he acted in Norway's best interest with the goal of restoring Norwegian independence.[^118] Some historians suggest that while this self-justification was delusional, it may have been sincere—representing not cynical opportunism but catastrophic misjudgment.[^119]

A documentary titled "Vidkun Quisling: Leader, Humanitarian, Hero" (2019) attempted to present alternative perspectives on his life, focusing on his earlier achievements, though such revisionist efforts remain highly controversial and are rejected by mainstream historiography.[^120]

---

### Negative Views

#### Premeditated Treachery

The dominant scholarly consensus views Quisling as guilty of premeditated treachery at the highest level. Unlike collaborators who might claim they were forced or had no choice after invasion, Quisling actively urged Hitler to invade Norway in December 1939, months before the April 1940 invasion.[^121] This premeditation distinguishes him from other collaborators and justifies his position as one of history's most infamous traitors.[^122]

Historians emphasize that Quisling's meetings with Hitler and Nazi leadership were secret and constituted active conspiracy against his own government while Norway remained neutral.[^123] This was not passive acceptance of occupation but active betrayal of national sovereignty.[^124]

#### Facilitating the Holocaust

Scholars universally condemn Quisling's role in the deportation and murder of Norwegian Jews. His reinstatement of anti-Jewish legislation and active participation in arrest, confiscation, and deportation made him complicit in genocide.[^125] The fact that he signed these measures willingly, not under German duress, demonstrates moral culpability.[^126]

Research published in the Scandinavian Journal of History and other academic venues has documented in detail Quisling's active role in anti-Semitic persecution.[^127] Holocaust historians cite his case as an example of how local collaborators were essential to implementing Nazi genocide across occupied Europe.[^128]

#### Political Failure and Incompetence

Beyond moral condemnation, historians note Quisling's spectacular political failure. His party never won a parliamentary seat, peaking at 2.2% in 1933 and declining to 1.8% by 1936.[^129] Even under German occupation, he exercised minimal real power, constantly subordinated to Reichskommissar Josef Terboven.[^130] His government commanded no popular legitimacy and faced massive resistance from Norwegian churches, teachers, and civil society.[^131]

Some historians argue that Quisling's combination of intellectual brilliance and political incompetence reveals a personality fundamentally disconnected from reality. His grandiose self-perception as a misunderstood prophet contrasted sharply with his actual status as a despised puppet of a foreign occupation.[^132]

#### Legal and Ethical Controversies

While Quisling's guilt is not seriously disputed, some scholars have noted legal controversies surrounding his trial and execution. Capital punishment had been abolished in Norway in 1905, and the death sentence had not been executed since 1876.[^133] The legal framework used to execute Quisling involved retroactive application of laws he himself had approved during the occupation, raising complex jurisprudential questions.[^134]

Psychiatric controversies also emerged during his trial. Some neurologists claimed Quisling had a brain tumor that might have affected his judgment, though these claims were intensely disputed and ultimately rejected.[^135] Most scholars view these controversies as legally and medically interesting but morally irrelevant given the overwhelming evidence of his crimes.[^136]

## Famous Quotes

> "Europe is standing on the brink of the greatest tragedy in the history of the human race: a new world war, that may involve the doom of our entire civilisation."

Context: Quisling's apocalyptic rhetoric about European conflict reflected his belief that only authoritarian nationalism could prevent catastrophe, ironically before he would contribute to precisely such a tragedy.[^137]

> "Do not handicap yourself with the idea of revenge, for the trend of things will revenge your wrong not only upon the individuals responsible for your persecution, but on the society that has permitted this lawlessness."

Context: This quote, attributed to Quisling, reveals his tendency toward abstract philosophical reasoning detached from the concrete moral implications of his actions.[^138]

> "I'm convicted unfairly and I die innocent."

Context: Quisling's last words before execution at Akershus Fortress on October 24, 1945, at 2:40 AM. These words demonstrated his maintained delusion of righteousness even facing death, refusing to acknowledge his crimes against Norway and humanity.[^139]

> "If I am treasonous, I hope that a good many of Norway's sons would also be treasonous."

Context: From Quisling's four-hour trial defense speech, where he attempted to reframe his collaboration as patriotism. This statement revealed his fundamental inability to comprehend how completely Norwegian society rejected his actions.[^140]
