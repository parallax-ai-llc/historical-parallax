## Summary

For much of 2023, Israel experienced the largest sustained protest movement in its history. Every Saturday night, hundreds of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv and across the country to oppose the government's planned judicial overhaul. They carried Israeli flags, blocked highways, and warned that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was destroying democracy itself.[^1]

The proposed reforms would have dramatically reduced the Supreme Court's power to strike down legislation, given the government control over judicial appointments, and eliminated the court's ability to void "unreasonable" government decisions. Netanyahu and his coalition—Israel's most right-wing ever—argued the court had become too powerful. Critics saw something else: a prime minister on trial for corruption seeking to weaken the only institution that could hold him accountable.[^2]

The protests forced Netanyahu to pause the legislation in March 2023. When he pushed through the "reasonableness" amendment in July anyway, protesters returned with new fury. Then, on October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people. The protest movement largely suspended itself as war consumed the nation. But the underlying crisis hadn't gone away—it had only been postponed. In January 2024, the Supreme Court struck down the reasonableness law. The battle over Israeli democracy continues.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Israeli System

**No constitution:**
- Israel has "Basic Laws" instead
- Supreme Court interprets them
- Can strike down Knesset legislation

**The court's power:**
- Expanded since 1990s ("constitutional revolution")
- Can void "unreasonable" government decisions
- Judicial appointments: Independent committee
- Controversial among right wing

**Netanyahu and the court:**
- On trial since 2020 (corruption charges)
- Court could ultimately decide his fate
- Critics: Reform is about his trial
- Supporters: Reform predates trial[^4]

### The 2022 Election

**November 2022:**
- Netanyahu won with far-right coalition
- Religious Zionists, ultra-Orthodox parties
- Most right-wing government in Israeli history

**Coalition partners' agendas:**
- Weakening court (ideological goal)
- Religious exemptions (ultra-Orthodox)
- Settlement expansion (far right)
- Netanyahu: Staying out of prison?

**Justice Minister Yariv Levin:**
- Announced reform plans January 2023
- Long-time judicial reform advocate[^5]

## The Proposed Reforms

**What the plan included:**

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| "Reasonableness" clause elimination | Court couldn't void "unreasonable" decisions |
| Knesset override | 61 votes could override court rulings |
| Judicial appointments | Government control over appointments |
| Ministerial legal advisors | No longer binding opinions |

**What critics said:**
- End of checks and balances
- Authoritarian backsliding
- Like Hungary and Poland
- Netanyahu protecting himself

**What supporters said:**
- Court too powerful
- Unelected judges shouldn't override parliament
- Democratic reform, not destruction[^6]

## The Protests

### Phase 1: The Movement Builds (January-March 2023)

**January:**
- Levin announced reforms
- First protests: Thousands
- Weekly Saturday demonstrations began

**February:**
- Protests grew: 80,000+
- High-tech sector organized
- Reservists warned: Won't serve if democracy dies

**March:**
- Protests at 100,000+
- General strike threatened
- Histradut (labor federation) called strike
- Economy minister warned of collapse

**March 27, 2023:**
- Netanyahu announced "pause"
- Said he'd seek dialogue
- Protesters celebrated—but warily[^7]

### Phase 2: Negotiations Fail (April-June 2023)

**President Herzog's dialogue:**
- Tried to broker compromise
- Opposition and coalition negotiated
- Collapsed in June

**Why:**
- Coalition wouldn't compromise sufficiently
- Opposition wouldn't accept any version
- Trust absent

**By late June, government resumed legislation.**

### Phase 3: The "Reasonableness" Vote (July 2023)

**July 24, 2023:**
- Knesset passed "reasonableness" amendment
- 64-0 (opposition boycotted)

**Protests:**
- Huge demonstrations
- Reservists announced: We won't serve
- Pilots, special forces, others
- Security establishment warned of damage

**The crisis deepened—until October 7.**[^8]

### October 7, 2023: Everything Changes

**Hamas attack:**
- 1,200 killed
- 250 hostages taken
- Worst attack in Israeli history
- War began

**Protest movement:**
- Suspended itself
- National emergency took precedence
- Some organizers joined war effort
- Criticism of Netanyahu continued (preparation failures)

**But the constitutional battle was on hold.**

---

## Resolution (Partial)

### January 2024: Supreme Court Strikes Down

**January 1, 2024:**
- Supreme Court ruled 8-7
- "Reasonableness" amendment unconstitutional
- First time court struck down Basic Law amendment
- Netanyahu: "Disappointed but will respect"

**What it meant:**
- Court defended itself
- Reform largely stalled
- Coalition didn't have votes to override
- War consumed government attention[^9]

---

## Death Toll and Injuries

**The protests were notably nonviolent:**

| Category | Number |
|----------|--------|
| Deaths | 0 (directly protest-related) |
| Injuries | Minimal |
| Arrests | Very few |

**Police use of force:**
- Water cannons occasionally
- Some clashes
- But: Largely peaceful movement

**The remarkable discipline of protesters was regularly noted.**

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Immediate:**
- Netanyahu's legal troubles
- Coalition partners' ideology
- Opportunity with strong majority

**Underlying:**
- Long-standing right-wing grievance against court
- Cultural divide: Secular-liberal vs. religious-nationalist
- Definition of democracy contested

### What Did It Show?

**Israeli society divided:**
- Tel Aviv vs. settlements
- Secular vs. religious
- Ashkenazi-liberal vs. traditional
- The "two nations" narrative

**Resilience:**
- Protests were massive, sustained
- Civil society mobilized
- Reservists willing to refuse

**Limits:**
- Couldn't stop July law initially
- October 7 interrupted everything
- Long-term resolution unclear

### Comparison

| Movement | Duration | Deaths | Outcome |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| **Israel 2023** | **9 months** | **0** | **Supreme Court struck down; reform stalled** |
| Hungary | Episodic | 0 | Orbán succeeded |
| Poland | Various | 0 | PiS eventually voted out |

**Israeli protests were among the largest per capita in any democracy.**[^10]

## Legacy

### For Israel

- Revealed deep divisions
- Court defended independence (for now)
- October 7 overshadowed but didn't resolve
- Coalition still in office (as of late 2024)
- Issue dormant, not dead

### For Democracy

- Model of civil resistance
- Reservists' role: Unique
- High-tech sector as political actor
- But: Uncertain ending

### October 7 Connection

**Some argue:**
- National divisions weakened security
- Government distracted by reform
- October 7 was (partial) consequence

**Others:**
- Separate issues
- Hamas chose timing independently

**Either way, October 7 froze the political battle.**[^11]
