## Summary

Moon Jae-in (born January 24, 1953) is a South Korean politician and human rights lawyer who served as the 12th President of South Korea from 2017 to 2022.[^1] Inaugurated immediately after the impeachment of Park Geun-hye and the Candlelight Revolution, Moon's presidency was defined by his "Moonshine Policy" of engagement with North Korea, his hallmark **"Income-led Growth"** economic strategy, and the globally praised **"K-Quarantine"** response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[^2] While he achieved unprecedented diplomatic visibility and successfully managed the pandemic without a lockdown, his administration faced severe criticism for the skyrocketing real estate prices in Seoul, which doubled during his tenure, and deep political polarization over prosecution reform.[^3]

## Early Life and Human Rights Activism

Moon Jae-in was born on January 24, 1953, in Geoje Island, South Gyeongsang Province. His parents were refugees who had fled North Korea during the Hungnam Evacuation of 1950, a background that deeply influenced his desire for inter-Korean peace.[^4] Growing up in poverty in Busan, he excelled academically and entered Kyung Hee University on a full scholarship to study law.[^5]

His university years were marked by student activism against the Park Chung-hee dictatorship. He was arrested, imprisoned, and expelled for organizing protests against the Yushin Constitution.[^6] Later conscripted into the Special Forces (707th Special Mission Battalion), he participated in the response to the tragic axe murder incident at Panmunjom in 1976.

After passing the bar exam, he was barred from becoming a judge due to his police record. He returned to Busan and formed a fateful partnership with **Roh Moo-hyun**, a fellow lawyer. Together, they defended students and workers persecuted by the military regime, cementing their bond as key figures in the pro-democracy movement.[^7]

## Political Career

### The "Kingmaker" and Chief of Staff

When Roh Moo-hyun became president in 2003, Moon served as his Civil Affairs Secretary and later his Chief of Staff.[^8] During this time, he was known as "Shadow of Roh." The tragic suicide of Roh in 2009 thrust Moon into the spotlight as the "Chief Mourner" and the successor to the pro-Roh political legacy.[^9]

### Presidential Bids

He entered the National Assembly in 2012 and ran for president against Park Geun-hye, losing narrowly. Following Park's impeachment in 2017, he ran again, winning a decisive victory with 41.1% of the vote in a multi-way race, promising to create "a nation worthy of being called a nation."[^10]

## Presidency (2017–2022)

Moon's presidency focused on peace-building, distributive economics, and crisis management.

### Inter-Korean Peace Process

Moon's most visible achievement was his diplomatic engagement with North Korea. In 2018, he met Kim Jong-un three times, including the historic **Panmunjom Summit** where the two leaders crossed the Military Demarcation Line holding hands.[^11] He played a pivotal role in brokering the first-ever US-North Korea summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore. Although talks eventually stalled, his efforts significantly reduced war tensions on the Korean Peninsula in 2018-2019.

### Income-led Growth and Economic Policy

Domestically, Moon championed **"Income-led Growth,"** a theory that increasing household income would drive consumption and growth.[^12]

- **Minimum Wage:** He aggressively raised the minimum wage by **16.4%** in 2018 and **10.9%** in 2019, the steepest hikes in decades.[^13]
- **Work-Life Balance:** He reduced the maximum work week from 68 to **52 hours**, aiming to reduce overwork and create more jobs.[^14]
- **Public Sector Jobs:** He pledged to create 814,000 public sector jobs to combat youth unemployment.
- **Nuclear Phase-Out:** He initiated a long-term plan to phase out nuclear power, permanently closing the Kori-1 reactor and halting new construction, a policy that drew fierce opposition from the energy sector.[^15]

### K-Quarantine: COVID-19 Response

The Moon administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic became a global model. Using a strategy of **"3T" (Test, Trace, Treat)**, South Korea contained the virus without a draconian lockdown.[^16]

- **Innovation:** Features like drive-through testing centers and rigorous contact tracing kept death rates famously low.[^17]
- **Political Impact:** The success of K-Quarantine helped his Democratic Party win a landslide supermajority (180 seats) in the 2020 legislative elections, a feat unprecedented in Korean history.[^18]

## Controversies

### Real Estate Crisis

The greatest failure of his administration was housing policy. Despite over 20 rounds of cooling measures (taxes, loan restrictions), **apartment prices in Seoul effectively doubled** during his term.[^19]

- **Impact:** The median price of an apartment in Seoul soared, fueling a sense of hopelessness among the younger generation ("2030 generation") and widening the wealth gap.[^20] The **LH Scandal** (public housing officials speculating on land) further enraged the public.

### Division and Prosecution Reform

Moon moved to weaken the power of the prosecution service, viewing it as politically biased. This led to a brutal, years-long conflict with his own appointed Prosecutor General, **Yoon Suk-yeol**.[^21] The appointment of **Cho Kuk** as Justice Minister triggered massive counter-protests, splitting the nation into "pro-Cho" and "anti-Cho" camps and ultimately elevating Yoon Suk-yeol to the status of opposition presidential candidate.

### Sexual Harassment Scandals

The moral authority of his party was severely damaged by a series of sexual harassment scandals involving high-profile Democratic Party leaders, including the mayors of Seoul (Park Won-soon) and Busan (Oh Keo-don), both of whom had been key allies.[^22]

## Legacy

Moon Jae-in left office in May 2022 with an approval rating of around 40%—exceptionally high for an outgoing Korean president.[^23] He retired to a quiet village in Yangsan, famously stating he wanted to be "forgotten."

### Historical Assessment

**Positive Views:**

1.  **Peacemaker:** Supporters laud him for preventing war in 2017 and bringing North Korea to the negotiating table, creating a vision of a peaceful peninsula.[^24]
2.  **Crisis Manager:** His science-based leadership during the pandemic saved thousands of lives and protected the economy from the worst of the global shock.[^25]
3.  **Welfare State Builder:** He significantly strengthened the social safety net, introducing "Mooncare" (expanded health insurance) and increasing support for the vulnerable.[^26]

**Negative Views:**

1.  **Economic Mismanagement:** Critics argue his "Income-led Growth" hurt small businesses and his anti-market housing policies devastated the middle class.[^27]
2.  **Naive Diplomacy:** Conservatives view his peace initiative as a "fake peace" that gave North Korea time to advance its nuclear arsenal while weakening the ROK-US alliance.[^28]
3.  **National Division:** His relentless pursuit of "clearing deep-rooted evils" (political retribution) and prosecution reform left the country more polarized than ever.[^29]
