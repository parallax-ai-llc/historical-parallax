## Summary

Moon Jae-in (born January 24, 1953) is a South Korean politician and human rights lawyer who served as the 12th President of South Korea from 2017 to 2022.[^1] He took office immediately following the impeachment of Park Geun-hye, facing the challenge of restoring public trust and calming heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula. His presidency was defined by a series of historic inter-Korean summits, an ambitious "income-led growth" economic policy, and a widely praised response to the COVID-19 pandemic.[^2] However, his administration also faced intense criticism for skyrocketing real estate prices, perceived policy failures in the prosecution reform, and a polarizing political environment.[^3]

## Early Life and Human Rights Activism

Moon Jae-in was born on January 24, 1953, in Geoje Island, South Gyeongsang Province, to refugees who had fled North Korea during the Korean War.[^4] Growing up in poverty in Busan, he excelled academically and entered Kyung Hee University on a full scholarship to study law.[^5]

His university years were marked by student activism against the Park Chung-hee dictatorship. He was arrested, imprisoned, and expelled for organizing protests against the Yushin Constitution.[^6] After his forced conscription into the Special Forces (where he notably participated in the response to the axe murder incident at Panmunjom), he passed the bar exam but was barred from becoming a judge due to his activist record.[^7]

He chose to become a lawyer and met fellow human rights attorney **Roh Moo-hyun** in Busan. The two formed a partnership that changed the course of their lives, dedicating themselves to defending labor rights and democracy activists.[^8]

## Political Career

### The "Kingmaker" and Chief of Staff
When Roh Moo-hyun entered politics and eventually became president in 2003, Moon served as his "shadow," holding key positions including Senior Secretary for Civil Affairs and Chief of Staff.[^9] After Roh's tragic suicide in 2009, Moon managed the funeral and emerged as the de facto leader of the pro-Roh political faction, earning the nickname "Dark King" or "Roh's Chief Mourner."[^10]

### Presidential Bids
Moon entered electoral politics in 2012, winning a parliamentary seat and running for president as the candidate of the Democratic United Party. He narrowly lost to Park Geun-hye.[^11] Following the 2016 candlelight protests and President Park's impeachment, Moon ran again in 2017 and won a decisive victory, promising to create "a country worthy of being a country."[^12]

## Presidency (2017–2022)

Moon's presidency focused on peace-building, economic reform, and managing the global pandemic.

### Inter-Korean Peace Process
Moon prioritized diplomatic engagement with North Korea. In 2018, he held three historic summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, including the Panmunjom Declaration, which aimed for the denuclearization of the peninsula.[^13] He also facilitated the first-ever US-North Korea summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.[^14] While relations later stalled, his efforts significantly de-escalated war fears in 2017.

### Economic and Social Policy
Domestically, Moon championed "Income-led Growth," raising the minimum wage significantly and reducing maximum working hours to improve work-life balance.[^15] He also pledged to phase out nuclear power in favor of renewable energy.[^16] However, his housing policies failed to curb speculation, leading to a massive surge in real estate prices in Seoul that alienated young voters.[^17]

### COVID-19 Response
The Moon administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, known as "K-Quarantine" (mass testing, tracing, and treating), was globally lauded as a model of success, keeping deaths relatively low without a full lockdown.[^18] This success helped his ruling party win a landslide supermajority in the 2020 legislative elections.[^19]

## Controversies

### Real Estate Crisis
The doubling of apartment prices in Seoul during his term remains the biggest failure of his administration. Despite over 20 rounds of cooling measures, prices continued to rise, widening the wealth gap and fueling public anger.[^20]

### Cho Kuk Scandal and Prosecution Reform
Moon's attempt to reform the powerful prosecution service led to a vicious political battle involving his Justice Minister appointee, Cho Kuk. The scandal deepened political polarization and ultimately boosted the profile of Prosecutor General Yoon Suk-yeol, who would go on to become Moon's successor.[^21]

### Sexual Harassment Scandals in the Party
Several high-profile figures in his Democratic Party, including the mayors of Seoul and Busan, were implicated in sexual harassment scandals, severely damaging the party's moral standing on gender issues.[^22]

## Legacy

Moon Jae-in left office with a relatively high approval rating (around 40%) compared to predecessors, avoiding the "lame duck" curse of widespread corruption or imprisonment.[^23] He is remembered as a peace-maker who brought the Korean Peninsula back from the brink of war and a leader who elevated South Korea's international status during the pandemic.[^24] However, his inability to solve the housing crisis and the deepening of political polarization remain critical stains on his record.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

1.  **Peace on the Peninsula:** Supporters view him as the architect of the "Korean Peninsula Peace Process." His diplomacy in 2018 is credited with preventing a potential military conflict and opening a new chapter of dialogue.[^25]
2.  **K-Quarantine:** His administration's science-based, transparent, and democratic response to COVID-19 saved thousands of lives and protected the economy from the worst of the global recession, serving as a global benchmark.[^26]
3.  **Welfare Expansion:** He significantly expanded the social safety net, increased the minimum wage, and introduced "Mooncare" to broaden health insurance coverage, reducing the burden of medical costs for ordinary citizens.[^27]

### Negative Views

1.  **Real Estate Policy Failure:** Critics argue his regulatory approach to the housing market was a disaster that made homeownership impossible for an entire generation, exacerbating inequality.[^28]
2.  **Prosecution Reform and Polarization:** His relentless push for prosecution reform is seen by opponents as an attempt to weaken institutional checks and balances to protect his allies, leading to extreme national division.[^29]
3.  **Submissive Foreign Policy:** Conservatives attack his North Korea policy as "begging for peace" and being too subservient to Pyongyang and Beijing, arguing that it failed to achieve tangible denuclearization while weakening the US alliance.[^30]
