## Summary

Wilhelm Röntgen was a German physicist who discovered X-rays in 1895, for which he received the first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. His discovery revolutionized medicine by enabling non-invasive imaging of the human body. He refused to patent his discovery, believing it should benefit all of humanity. The term 'X-ray' comes from the mathematical symbol for an unknown quantity.
