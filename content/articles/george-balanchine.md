## Summary

George Balanchine was a Russian-American choreographer who co-founded the New York City Ballet and is considered the father of American ballet. His neoclassical style stripped ballet to its essence, privileging musicality, speed, and geometric form. He created over 400 works, including Serenade, The Nutcracker, and Agon, redefining ballet for the modern era.
