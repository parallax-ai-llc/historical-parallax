## Summary

Fritz Haber was a German chemist who received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gases (Haber-Bosch process). This process enabled mass production of fertilizers and explosives, fundamentally changing agriculture and warfare. He is considered both a benefactor of humanity (feeding billions through synthetic fertilizer) and a war criminal (developing chemical weapons used in World War I). He is sometimes called the 'father of chemical warfare.'
