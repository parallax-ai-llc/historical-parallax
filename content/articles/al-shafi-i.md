## Summary

Al-Shafi'i was an Islamic jurist who founded the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence and systematized Islamic legal theory (usul al-fiqh). His Risala is the first work of Islamic jurisprudence to lay out a comprehensive methodology for deriving legal rulings. He mediated between the rationalist approach of Abu Hanifa and the traditionist approach of Malik. The Shafi'i school is predominant in East Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of the Middle East.
