## Summary

Miles Dewey Davis III (May 26, 1926 – September 28, 1991) was an American jazz trumpeter, bandleader, and composer who is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music.[^1] With a career spanning roughly five decades, Davis kept himself at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz, from bebop and cool jazz to hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion.[^2] He recorded at least 60 studio albums and 39 live albums, and his 1959 album *Kind of Blue* is the best-selling jazz album of all time.[^3] Davis's innovative trumpet playing, characterized by a smooth, vibrato-less tone, and his relentless pursuit of musical evolution made him one of the most transformative artists of the twentieth century.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Miles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, in Alton, Illinois, to Miles Dewey Davis II and Cleota Mae Henry Davis.[^5] His father was a prosperous dental surgeon and ranch owner, providing the family with an upper-middle-class lifestyle that was unusual for African Americans at that time.[^6] Miles was the second of three children, with an older sister Dorothy and a younger brother Vernon.[^7] Shortly after his birth, the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis spent his formative years in a relatively privileged environment that shielded him from some of the harsher realities of racial discrimination, though he would later confront these issues directly.[^8]

Davis's musical journey began early when he received a trumpet as a gift from his father on his 13th birthday.[^9] He began taking lessons with Elwood Buchanan, a local trumpeter and high-school teacher who would prove to be a formative influence.[^10] Buchanan's most important lesson was advising Davis to play without vibrato, contrary to the prevailing style of the era.[^11] This guidance would profoundly shape Davis's distinctive sound—a clear, lyrical tone that would become his signature and influence countless musicians.[^12] The vibrato-less approach allowed Davis to emulate the sound of the human voice, turning his jazz into a smoother and more emotional form of music.[^13]

During his teenage years, Davis played in local bands and gained experience performing in the vibrant St. Louis music scene.[^14] His talent was evident early on, and by age 16, he was already performing professionally with local jazz groups.[^15] In 1944, at age 18, Davis had a transformative experience when Billy Eckstine's band, which included Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie, came to St. Louis.[^16] Davis was asked to fill in for a sick trumpet player, giving him his first exposure to the bebop pioneers who would soon become his mentors and collaborators.[^17]

In 1944, Davis moved to New York City ostensibly to study at the prestigious Juilliard School of Music.[^18] However, his true motivation was to find and play with Charlie Parker, the legendary alto saxophonist who was revolutionizing jazz.[^19] At Juilliard, Davis earned a solid B average and studied classical music theory and composition, knowledge that would later inform his innovative approaches to jazz.[^20] Despite his academic success, Davis became frustrated with the Eurocentrism of the curriculum and dropped out after three semesters to pursue his true passion: performing bebop in the clubs of 52nd Street and Harlem.[^21]

## Rise to Power

Davis's professional career began in earnest when he joined Charlie Parker's bebop quintet from 1944 to 1948, making his recording debut at age 19.[^22] Working alongside Parker, one of the greatest improvisers in jazz history, was both thrilling and intimidating for the young trumpeter.[^23] During this period, Davis developed his craft, though he later admitted feeling inadequate compared to Parker's virtuosity and Dizzy Gillespie's technical brilliance.[^24] However, this perceived limitation forced Davis to develop his own voice—one that emphasized space, melody, and emotional depth over technical pyrotechnics.[^25]

In 1949-1950, Davis took a bold step that would establish him as an innovative force in jazz.[^26] He formed a nonet that included arranger Gil Evans, saxophonists Gerry Mulligan and Lee Konitz, and other noted musicians.[^27] This group recorded twelve tracks that were later compiled and released as *Birth of the Cool* in 1957.[^28] The recordings marked a departure from the frenetic energy of bebop, featuring smooth lines, soft dynamics, and a light, spare sound that gave the music an emotional pitch lower than bebop.[^29] These sessions are credited with starting the cool jazz movement and creating a viable alternative to bebop, fundamentally transforming jazz history.[^30]

The early 1950s brought significant personal challenges for Davis. He became addicted to heroin, a drug that had ensnared many jazz musicians of the era.[^31] By his own admission, Davis "lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift."[^32] He supported his expensive habit by performing and "living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes and receiving money from friends."[^33] By 1953, his addiction began to seriously impair his playing.[^34] However, in 1954, Davis made the courageous decision to quit heroin cold turkey.[^35] He returned to his father's home in East St. Louis and then spent about six months in Detroit, deliberately avoiding New York City where drugs were easily available.[^36] The withdrawal was excruciating, but Davis persevered.[^37] By February 1954, he returned to New York City "feeling good for the first time in a long time," mentally and physically stronger.[^38]

Davis's successful recovery led to his greatest period: the mid-to-late 1950s.[^39] In 1955, he formed his First Great Quintet, which would become one of the greatest combos in jazz history.[^40] At the recommendation of drummer Philly Joe Jones, Davis hired tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, beginning a partnership that would last five years and produce some of the most influential music in jazz history.[^41] The group showcased a dazzling contrast between Davis's singing, luminescent tone and lyrical, laid-back improvisations and Coltrane's zealous, bursting-forth solos.[^42] Davis soon realized he had found not just a great sideman in Coltrane, but the perfect counterpoint to his own subdued trumpet.[^43]

## Major Achievements

Davis's career from the mid-1950s through the 1970s represents an unparalleled period of innovation and artistic achievement in jazz. From 1951 through 1956, while recording under the Prestige Records label, Davis helped define the hard bop sound, recording studio albums that affected the work of numerous other artists.[^44] His albums from this period, including *'Round About Midnight* (1956), *Workin'* (1956), *Steamin'* (1956), *Relaxin'* (1956), and *Milestones* (1958), became touchstones of modern jazz.[^45]

Throughout the 1950s, Davis collaborated with arranger Gil Evans to create large-band-arranged jazz pieces that represented some of the most sophisticated and beautiful music in jazz history.[^46] Their three great albums on the Columbia label—*Miles Ahead* (1957), *Porgy and Bess* (1959), and *Sketches of Spain* (1960)—are all considered classics.[^47] Evans was Davis's best friend, mentor, and musical alter ego who recognized Davis's unique gifts and could match the trumpeter's insatiable need for change and growth.[^48] *Porgy and Bess*, their adaptation of George Gershwin's opera, was called "possibly the best of the collaborations between Miles and Gil Evans" by JazzTimes magazine and became Davis's biggest-selling album before *Bitches Brew*.[^49] *Sketches of Spain* featured lush orchestral arrangements that blended jazz improvisation with Spanish folk music, flamenco rhythms, and classical influences.[^50]

The late 1950s saw Davis embrace modal jazz, a revolutionary approach that would define his most celebrated work.[^51] Influenced by composer and theorist George Russell's *Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization* (1953), Davis began exploring modes rather than standard chord changes.[^52] Russell's search for a scale of "unity"—a scale that could embody the sound of a chord—was a primary influence on Davis's development at the end of the decade.[^53] Modal jazz makes use of musical modes, often modulating among them to accompany the chords instead of relying on one tonal center, founded on the underlying goal of melodic freedom rather than static harmonies.[^54]

This exploration culminated in *Kind of Blue*, recorded in 1959 and released that same year.[^55] The album is regarded by many critics as Davis's masterpiece, the greatest jazz album ever recorded, and one of the greatest albums of all time.[^56] Recorded on three-track tape in two sessions at Columbia Records' 30th Street Studio, the album featured an extraordinary ensemble: tenor saxophonist John Coltrane, alto saxophonist Julian "Cannonball" Adderley, pianists Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly, bassist Paul Chambers, drummer Jimmy Cobb, and Davis on trumpet.[^57] Basing *Kind of Blue* entirely on modality, Davis gave each performer a set of scales that encompassed the parameters of their improvisation, providing more creative freedom with melodies.[^58] The result was a universally acknowledged masterpiece that became the best-selling jazz album of all time and one of the most influential albums ever made, impacting jazz, rock, and classical music.[^59]

In 1964, Davis formed his Second Great Quintet, featuring Herbie Hancock on piano, Wayne Shorter on saxophone, Ron Carter on bass, and Tony Williams on drums.[^60] This group pushed the boundaries of post-bop jazz and became known for their telepathic interplay and adventurous improvisations.[^61] The musicians from this quintet would go on to become major forces in jazz themselves, demonstrating Davis's exceptional ability to identify and nurture talent.[^62]

Beginning with *Miles in the Sky* in 1968, Davis permanently abandoned hard bop and adopted jazz fusion and avant-garde jazz.[^63] He released *Bitches Brew* in 1970, an era-defining double album filled with "swirling, extended jams and kaleidoscopic mix of acoustic and electric instruments."[^64] Recorded from August 19-21, 1969, the album marked the beginning of Davis's "electric period," incorporating electric piano, guitar, and jazz fusion styles.[^65] With electric instruments, Davis departed from traditional jazz rhythms in favor of loose, rock-influenced arrangements based on improvisation.[^66] The album's most important innovation was rhythmic, featuring two bassists, two-to-three electric piano players, and two drummers plus percussion who all drew on soul, rock, and the influence of electric guitar pioneer Jimi Hendrix.[^67] *Bitches Brew* sold over 100,000 units in its first year—an unheard-of number for a jazz musician—and ultimately sold 400,000 copies, four times the average for a Miles album.[^68] In 1971, it won a Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album.[^69]

Davis's electric period from 1968 to 1975 produced long electric jams released as *Pangaea*, *Agharta*, and *Dark Magus*, further cementing his role as a pioneer of jazz fusion.[^70] The musicians Davis worked with during this period—Wayne Shorter, Joe Zawinul, John McLaughlin, Chick Corea, and others—would go on to establish fusion as a driving force in the music business through bands like Weather Report, Mahavishnu Orchestra, and Return to Forever.[^71]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his monumental achievements, Davis's life and career were marked by significant controversies and legitimate criticisms that cannot be ignored. The most serious and reprehensible aspect of Davis's personal life was his abuse of women.[^72] In his 1989 autobiography, Davis admitted to physically abusing women, writing approvingly of his own violence and expressing admiration for other men who kept women "in line."[^73] His first wife, Frances Taylor, told *The New York Times*: "I actually left running for my life—more than once."[^74] *The Atlantic* characterized his treatment of women as "contemptible," and this aspect of his life represents an inexcusable moral failing that mars his legacy.[^75]

Davis also struggled with substance abuse throughout much of his career.[^76] Beyond his heroin addiction in the early 1950s, in 1975 Davis became addicted to cocaine and alcohol, leading to a five-year hiatus from music during which he became reclusive and his health deteriorated significantly.[^77] These addictions affected not only his personal relationships but also his creative output and reliability as a performer.[^78]

Davis gained a reputation for being cold, distant, and easily angered.[^79] He was known to play with his back to the audience, which some interpreted as arrogance or contempt for his listeners.[^80] Davis defended this practice, explaining that he wanted the audience to focus on the music rather than watching him, and that he turned his back so he could hear the other musicians better and give them cues.[^81] Nevertheless, his difficult personality alienated some fans and fellow musicians.[^82] He feuded publicly with trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, with each criticizing the other's approach to jazz.[^83]

Davis's venture into jazz fusion in the late 1960s and 1970s drew harsh criticism from jazz purists.[^84] In 1990, writer Stanley Crouch, a prominent critic of jazz fusion, labeled Davis "the most brilliant sellout in the history of jazz," arguing that he had abandoned jazz's core principles for commercial success.[^85] Music critic James Lincoln Collier stated that "if his influence was profound, the ultimate value of his work is another matter," calling Davis an "adequate instrumentalist" but "not a great one."[^86] In a 1993 essay in *The Musical Quarterly*, Robert Walser noted that "Davis has long been infamous for missing more notes than any other major trumpet player," questioning how to account for such technical defects in the performances of someone indisputably important in jazz history.[^87]

In August 1959, just eight days after the release of *Kind of Blue*, Davis was the victim of a brutal, unprovoked assault by New York City police outside Birdland, the jazz club where his name appeared on the marquee.[^88] During a break from performing, Davis was standing outside when a white police officer told him to move on.[^89] When Davis explained that he was working at the club, a white detective suddenly attacked him, hitting him on the head with a billy club.[^90] Davis was arrested for "resisting arrest" and taken to St. Clare's Hospital, where he received ten stitches.[^91] Despite a mountain of evidence in his favor, including multiple witness statements and photographic evidence, Davis's lawsuit against the NYPD was dismissed.[^92] The incident had a profound impact on Davis, who stated in his autobiography that it "changed my whole life and whole attitude," contributing to the bitterness and anger he sometimes displayed.[^93]

## Personal Life

Miles Davis was married three times and had four children.[^94] His first marriage was to Irene Birth, with whom he had three children: Cheryl, Gregory, and Miles IV.[^95] His second wife was Frances Taylor, a dancer who appeared on the cover of his album *Someday My Prince Will Come* (1961).[^96] Their marriage lasted nine years—Davis's longest—but was marked by his infidelity and abuse.[^97] Taylor left Davis for the final time shortly after the photograph for the album *E.S.P.* (1965) was taken, filing for divorce in 1966, which was finalized in February 1968.[^98]

In September 1968, Davis married Betty Mabry, a model and aspiring singer.[^99] Betty introduced Davis to the fashions and popular music trends of the era, including the music of Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone, which profoundly influenced his turn toward jazz fusion.[^100] The album *Filles de Kilimanjaro* (1968) features Betty on the cover and includes a song named after her.[^101] However, the marriage lasted only one year, ending when Davis filed for divorce in 1969 after accusing Mabry of having an affair with Hendrix.[^102] After their divorce, Betty Mabry continued her music career under the name Betty Davis and became an influential funk musician in her own right.[^103]

Davis's fourth and final marriage was to actress Cicely Tyson, whom he had first dated in the 1960s before his marriage to Betty Mabry.[^104] They rekindled their relationship in 1978 and married on November 26, 1981, in a ceremony conducted by Atlanta mayor Andrew Young at the home of actor Bill Cosby.[^105] Davis credited Tyson with saving his life and helping him overcome his cocaine addiction.[^106] However, their relationship was turbulent due to Davis's volatile temper and infidelity, and Tyson filed for divorce in 1988.[^107] Their divorce was finalized in 1989, two years before Davis's death.[^108]

Beyond his marriages, Davis had a fourth child, Erin, from another relationship.[^109] Davis was known for his impeccable sense of style, often appearing in expensive, tailored suits and later adopting more flamboyant fashion influenced by the rock era.[^110] He was also an amateur photographer and visual artist, and his paintings were exhibited in galleries.[^111] Despite his often harsh public persona, those close to Davis described moments of warmth, humor, and generosity, suggesting a more complex personality than his reputation might indicate.[^112]

Davis's health problems mounted in his later years.[^113] In addition to his struggles with addiction, he suffered from sickle cell anemia, which caused him chronic pain throughout his life.[^114] He also dealt with hip problems that required surgery, diabetes, and respiratory issues exacerbated by years of smoking.[^115] On September 28, 1991, Davis died at the age of 65 from pneumonia and respiratory failure at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, California.[^116]

## Legacy

Miles Davis's impact on music extends far beyond jazz, influencing musicians across multiple genres and generations. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the history of jazz and 20th-century music, with 2,452 Wikipedia pages mentioning him and over 286 citing him as an influence as of 2016.[^117] Davis redefined the boundaries of jazz repeatedly across five decades, moving from bebop to cool jazz, modal innovations, and finally to the explosive energy of jazz fusion.[^118] Most notably, Davis used his trumpet to emulate the sound of the human voice by eliminating vibrato, turning his jazz into a smoother and more emotional form of music.[^119]

Davis played a crucial role in jazz education and mentorship, with his commitment to guiding emerging talents contributing to the preservation and perpetuation of jazz as an art form.[^120] Davis's impact is evident in the countless artists he mentored, from Herbie Hancock to Wayne Shorter, who carried his spirit of innovation forward.[^121] His various groups served as incubators for talent, with alumni including John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Chick Corea, Keith Jarrett, John McLaughlin, and countless others who became major forces in music.[^122]

Davis has influenced artists across various musical genres beyond jazz, including Lenny Kravitz, The Allman Brothers Band, Carlos Santana, and Lana Del Rey.[^123] He defined the sound—and sounds—of modern jazz like no other through the way he integrated the electrical instrumentation of genres like rock, funk, and soul, making him one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century in any genre.[^124] The impact of Miles Davis reverberates in the work of contemporary jazz artists, with his influence heard in the eclectic sounds of musicians who draw inspiration from his innovative spirit.[^125]

Davis received eight Grammy Awards during his lifetime, plus a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990 and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards.[^126] Ten of his recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, including *Birth of the Cool*, *Bitches Brew*, and *Kind of Blue*.[^127] In 2006, Davis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, recognized as "one of the key figures in the history of jazz."[^128] His discography consists of at least 60 studio albums and 39 live albums, as well as 46 compilation albums, 27 box sets, and numerous other releases.[^129]

*Kind of Blue* remains the best-selling jazz album of all time and has been added to the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress.[^130] The album's influence on music, including jazz, rock, and classical music, has led writers to deem it one of the most influential albums ever made.[^131] Davis's innovations in modal jazz, jazz fusion, and his various other stylistic developments continue to serve as foundations for musicians exploring new territories in improvised music.[^132]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic and critical assessment of Davis's work emphasizes his role as a transformative figure in American music. Scholars note that Davis was at the forefront of changes in jazz for more than 40 years in the post-World War II period.[^133] His ability to continually reinvent himself and the music around him is seen as evidence of extraordinary artistic vision and courage.[^134] Musicologist Alexander P. Chabraja has studied how Davis pioneered the emergence of chord-scale association during the late 1950s, a conceptual shift characterized by the application of modes and their properties into jazz aesthetics.[^135]

George Russell's influence on Davis through the *Lydian Chromatic Concept of Tonal Organization* represents one of the most important theoretical developments in jazz history, and Davis's application of these concepts in *Kind of Blue* and other works demonstrated his deep musical intelligence despite his lack of formal theoretical writings.[^136] Defenders of Davis's later fusion work argue that he was following the same innovative impulse that characterized his entire career, refusing to be bound by genre conventions and constantly seeking new forms of musical expression.[^137]

The National Endowment for the Arts honored Davis as a Jazz Master, recognizing his contributions to American culture.[^138] British music publication *Jazzwise* celebrated Davis and John Coltrane's partnership as representing "yin and yang," two complementary forces that together created something greater than either could achieve alone.[^139] Davis's commitment to change is seen as a model for artists: "It's not about standing still and becoming safe. If anybody wants to keep creating they have to be about change," as Davis himself stated.[^140]

### Negative Views

Critical voices have questioned whether Davis's influence has been overstated and whether technical limitations undermined the quality of his work. A 2017 article in *JSTOR Daily* titled "Do We Overstate Miles Davis' Genius?" raised questions about whether Davis's reputation exceeds his actual musical contributions.[^141] Robert Walser's influential 1993 essay "Out of Notes: Signification, Interpretation, and the Problem of Miles Davis" acknowledged that "Miles Davis has always been difficult to deal with critically" and noted his reputation for "missing more notes than any other major trumpet player."[^142] Walser asked how to account for such defects in the performances of someone indisputably important in jazz history, suggesting that Davis's significance lies more in his conceptual innovations than in technical mastery.[^143]

Stanley Crouch's denunciation of Davis as "the most brilliant sellout in the history of jazz" represents a broader critique from jazz purists who believe Davis abandoned the core values of jazz—swing, blues feeling, and acoustic instrumentation—for commercial gain and trendiness.[^144] Critics in this camp argue that Davis's fusion period diluted jazz's artistic integrity and opened the door to commercially oriented "smooth jazz" that they view as artistically bankrupt.[^145]

James Lincoln Collier's assessment that Davis was an "adequate instrumentalist" but "not a great one" reflects the view that Davis's technical limitations were real and significant, even if his conceptual contributions were important.[^146] Some critics argue that Davis's constant stylistic changes reflected restlessness and insecurity rather than genuine artistic growth, and that his later work lacks the focused beauty of his 1950s output.[^147] The moral criticism of Davis's treatment of women, acknowledged even by his admirers, has led some to question whether his artistic legacy can or should be separated from his personal conduct.[^148]
