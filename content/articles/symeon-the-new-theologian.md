## Summary

Symeon the New Theologian was a Byzantine mystic, abbot, and poet who is one of only three saints in Orthodox Christianity to be called 'Theologian' (along with John the Evangelist and Gregory of Nazianzus). He emphasized the personal experience of divine light and the possibility of conscious encounter with God. His hymns describing mystical visions of divine light are among the greatest mystical poetry in Christian literature.
