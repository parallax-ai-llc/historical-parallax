## Summary

Lawrence Bragg formulated Bragg's law of X-ray diffraction and became the youngest Nobel laureate at age 25 when he shared the 1915 Nobel Prize in Physics with his father William Henry Bragg. Their work founded X-ray crystallography, enabling determination of crystal structures. He later directed the Cavendish Laboratory during the discovery of DNA's structure.
