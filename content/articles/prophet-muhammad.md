## Summary

Prophet Muhammad is the founder of Islam and is regarded by Muslims as the final prophet of God (Allah). He received divine revelations over 23 years, compiled as the Quran. He unified the Arabian Peninsula under Islam and established a community (ummah) based on faith rather than tribal loyalty. His teachings, actions (Sunnah), and sayings (Hadith) form the foundation of Islamic law and practice.
