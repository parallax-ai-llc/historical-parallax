## Summary

On June 10, 1987, millions of South Koreans took to the streets in the largest pro-democracy protests the country had ever seen. They were demanding what the military dictatorships had denied for nearly three decades: the right to directly elect their president. Within 19 days, the regime surrendered. The June Democratic Struggle (6월 민주항쟁) ended authoritarian rule in South Korea and launched the world's most successful democratic transition.[^1]

The movement was catalyzed by two deaths. In January, Park Jong-chul, a 21-year-old student, was tortured to death by police—drowned during waterboarding. The regime tried to cover it up. Then, on June 9, Lee Han-yeol was struck in the head by a tear gas canister during a protest; the photograph of his limp body being carried by fellow students became the movement's iconic image. He died a month later.[^2]

On June 29, facing the prospect of mass bloodshed with the 1988 Seoul Olympics approaching, ruling party chairman Roh Tae-woo announced the "June 29 Declaration": direct presidential elections, release of political prisoners, and democratic reforms. In December 1987, South Korea held its first free presidential election in 16 years. The Sixth Republic was born—and democracy had won.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Military Rule (1961-1987)

South Korea was ruled by military strongmen for 26 years:

**Park Chung-hee (1961-1979):**

- Seized power in 1961 coup
- Rapid industrialization
- Yushin Constitution (1972): indefinite rule
- Assassinated October 1979

**Chun Doo-hwan (1980-1988):**

- Seized power after Park's death
- Crushed Gwangju Uprising (May 1980): hundreds killed
- Brutal dictatorship; but economy grew
- Planned indirect handover to successor Roh Tae-woo[^4]

### The Gwangju Connection

The 1980 Gwangju Uprising—brutally suppressed with hundreds dead—remained an open wound. By 1987, the memory of Gwangju motivated many protesters who were determined not to let the regime survive unchallenged again.[^5]

### Pressure Building (1985-1987)

- 1985: Opposition parties won unexpected gains in elections
- 1986: 1 million signatures demanding constitutional reform
- Constitutional debate: regime wanted indirect election; people demanded direct vote
- **April 13, 1987:** Chun Doo-hwan banned constitutional debate—igniting fury[^6]

---

## Catalysts

### Park Jong-chul (January 1987)

**January 14, 1987:** Seoul National University student Park Jong-chul died during police interrogation.

**Facts:**

- Arrested for questioning about activist locations
- Died from waterboarding torture
- Police claimed he "hit a desk and collapsed"
- Doctors and journalists exposed the truth
- Cover-up attempt amplified outrage

Park became a martyr; his death galvanized opposition.[^7]

### Roh Tae-woo's Nomination (June 10)

**June 10:** Ruling Democratic Justice Party nominated Roh Tae-woo as presidential candidate—to be selected by indirect electoral college.

This meant democracy would be denied for another seven years. The announcement triggered the uprising.[^8]

### Lee Han-yeol (June 9)

**June 9, 1987:** Yonsei University student Lee Han-yeol was struck in the head by a tear gas canister during a campus protest.

**The Photograph:**

- His unconscious body carried by a fellow student
- Blood streaming down his face
- Became the defining image of the struggle
- Lee never regained consciousness; died July 5

His injury—just one day before the main protests—intensified public rage.[^9]

---

## The June Struggle

### June 10-26: Nationwide Protests

**June 10:** Mass rallies began simultaneously across the country

- Seoul, Busan, Gwangju, Daegu, Daejeon...
- Estimates: millions participated over subsequent weeks
- Students, workers, professionals, housewives joined
- White-collar "necktie demonstrations" at lunch hours

**Daily protests continued for nearly three weeks**[^10]

### Tactics and Symbols

- Mass marches despite tear gas
- Honking cars in solidarity
- White headbands
- "Democratization" chants
- Human waves

### Violence and Tear Gas

The regime used enormous quantities of tear gas:

- Seoul was cloudedwith gas for weeks
- Injuries from canisters common
- Violence by riot police
- But no repeat of Gwangju-level massacre

**Key restraint factor:** 1988 Seoul Olympics approaching; international spotlight[^11]

---

## The June 29 Declaration

### Roh's Announcement

**June 29, 1987:** Roh Tae-woo shocked the nation with an 8-point declaration:

1. **Direct presidential election** (core demand met)
2. Peaceful transition of power
3. Amnesty for political prisoners (including Kim Dae-jung)
4. Protection of human rights and dignity
5. Freedom of the press
6. Local government autonomy
7. Political party freedom
8. Clean society reforms

The authoritarian regime had capitulated.[^12]

### Why?

- Facing millions in the streets
- Olympics deadline: couldn't risk bloodshed before global event
- US pressure for democratization
- Military divided; some feared civil war
- Chun Doo-hwan had limited options

---

## Aftermath

### Constitutional Revision

**October 1987:** New constitution approved by referendum (93% in favor)

- Direct presidential elections
- Single 5-year terms
- Enhanced human rights protections

### December 1987 Election

**December 16, 1987:** First direct presidential election since 1971

- Roh Tae-woo: 36.6%
- Kim Young-sam: 28%
- Kim Dae-jung: 27%
- Kim Jong-pil: 8%

**Irony:** Opposition split allowed Roh (the regime candidate) to win—but through a democratic vote.[^13]

### Lee Han-yeol's Funeral

**July 9, 1987:** Lee Han-yeol's funeral drew 1.6 million mourners in Seoul—one of the largest funerals in Korean history. It became a final demonstration of the movement's power.

---

## Death Toll

**Park Jong-chul:** Tortured to death January 14, 1987

**Lee Han-yeol:** Struck by tear gas canister June 9; died July 5, 1987

The June Struggle itself was notable for avoiding Gwangju-scale bloodshed—largely due to the regime's fear of international consequences before the Olympics.[^14]

## Historical Assessment

### Democratic Perspective

**Triumph of the People:** The June Democratic Struggle proved that sustained, nonviolent mass mobilization could topple even entrenched military dictatorships. Unlike Gwangju, where the military massacred protesters, the 1987 regime was forced to concede. This established democracy as irreversible in Korea.[^15]

**Generational Achievement:** The students who marched in 1987 had grown up under dictatorship. Their parents remembered the Korean War and prioritized stability. The '87 generation chose democracy over order—and won.

### Critical Perspective

**Limited Victory:** Roh Tae-woo won the subsequent election due to opposition splits. The military establishment retained influence into the 1990s. Full democratization—including prosecution of Chun and Roh for Gwangju—didn't occur until Kim Young-sam's presidency (1993-1998).

**Structural Continuity:** Many authoritarian bureaucratic and intelligence structures persisted. Democracy was established, but purging the deep state took longer.[^16]

## Legacy

### For South Korea

- June 10 became Democracy Fighters Day (국민항쟁기념일)
- Foundation of stable Korean democracy
- Direct line to today's vibrant civil society
- 2016-17 Candlelight Protests explicitly invoked 1987

### For Democratization

- Studied as successful nonviolent democratic transition
- Influenced activists in Taiwan, Philippines, other countries
- Showed mass protest could succeed without bloodshed

### The Democracy Trilogy

South Korean democracy is often understood through three uprisings:

1. **4.19 Revolution (1960):** First democratic victory
2. **Gwangju Uprising (1980):** Democratic martyrdom
3. **June Struggle (1987):** Democratic victory

Together they form Korea's founding democratic narrative.[^17]
