## Summary

Muhammadu Buhari was a Nigerian military general and politician who served as Nigeria's head of state during military rule from 1983 to 1985, and later as the democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. Born on December 17, 1942, in Daura, Katsina State, Buhari made history in 2015 by becoming the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president in Nigeria's modern democratic era.[^1] His eight-year civilian presidency was marked by ambitious anti-corruption campaigns, significant infrastructure development, and the fight against Boko Haram insurgency, but also by economic decline, mounting debt, human rights controversies, and accusations of authoritarianism.[^2] He died on July 13, 2025, in London at age 82, leaving behind a deeply contested legacy as both a symbol of integrity and discipline to his supporters, and a failed leader who undermined democracy and worsened Nigeria's problems to his critics.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Muhammadu Buhari was born on December 17, 1942, in Daura, a town in what is now Katsina State in northern Nigeria.[^4] He was the twenty-third child of his father, Mallam Hardo Adamu, a Fula chieftain.[^5] Tragedy struck early in Buhari's life when his father died when he was only three or four years old, leaving him to be raised primarily by his mother.[^6] This early loss shaped his character and instilled in him a sense of discipline and self-reliance that would define his later life.

Buhari received his primary education in Daura and Mai'Adua, graduating in 1953.[^7] He then gained admission to Katsina Middle School, later renamed Katsina Provincial Secondary School, where he attended from 1956 to 1961.[^8] During his time at Katsina, Buhari distinguished himself as a student leader, serving as both house captain and headboy during his sixth form.[^9] In 1960, while still in secondary school, he was awarded a prestigious scholarship by Elder Dempster Lines for a summer visit to the United Kingdom, an experience that broadened his horizons.[^10]

Originally, Buhari aspired to become a doctor, but the only available pathway at the time was to study Pharmacology at the Nigerian College of Arts, Science, and Technology in Zaria, which would have required many years of study.[^11] His nephew, Mamman Daura, advised him to join the Nigerian military instead, where he could pursue higher education while building a career.[^12] This pivotal advice set Buhari on the path that would define his life. In 1962, at age 19, Buhari was one of 70 boys selected for recruitment into the Nigerian Military Training College (NMTC) in Kaduna.[^13] In October 1963, he was sent to the Officers Cadet School in Aldershot in the United Kingdom, where he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant later that year.[^14]

## Rise to Power

After his commissioning in 1963, Buhari was posted to the 2nd Infantry Battalion in Abeokuta as Platoon Commander.[^15] His military career coincided with one of the most turbulent periods in Nigerian history. Buhari participated in the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970), fighting to preserve the unity of Nigeria against Biafran secession.[^16] This experience shaped his unwavering commitment to Nigerian unity, a theme that would recur throughout his political life.

Buhari's rise through the military ranks was steady and impressive. He received extensive military training both at home and abroad, including courses at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, India in 1973, and the United States Army War College from June 1979 to June 1980.[^17] These international experiences exposed him to various military doctrines and governance systems, broadening his strategic thinking.

The 1975 military coup that overthrew General Yakubu Gowon proved to be Buhari's breakthrough moment.[^18] Buhari was involved in this coup, and the new military head of state, General Murtala Mohammed, rewarded him with the position of military governor of the newly created North-Eastern State (now Borno State).[^19] When Murtala Mohammed was assassinated in a failed coup attempt in 1976, his successor, General Olusegun Obasanjo, appointed Buhari as Federal Commissioner (Minister) for Petroleum Resources, a crucial position given Nigeria's dependence on oil revenues.[^20] In 1977, Buhari became the military secretary at Supreme Military Headquarters, placing him at the heart of Nigeria's military government.[^21]

On December 31, 1983, amid widespread dissatisfaction with economic mismanagement and perceived corruption under the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari, a group of military officers staged a coup.[^22] Although Buhari was not the original ringleader of the coup, he emerged as the unanimous choice to become the new head of state, largely due to his reputation for integrity and his senior position in the military.[^23] At age 41, Major General Muhammadu Buhari became Nigeria's military head of state, promising to clean up the corruption that had plagued the Second Republic.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### Military Rule (1983-1985)

During his brief but impactful military rule from 1983 to 1985, Buhari launched an ambitious anti-corruption campaign that became the defining feature of his first time in power. Hundreds of politicians and business officials were arrested, tried, and convicted or held awaiting trial on corruption-related charges.[^25] This aggressive stance against corruption earned him both admiration and fear, establishing his reputation as an uncompromising disciplinarian.

In March 1984, Buhari launched the War Against Indiscipline (WAI), a mass mobilization program aimed at correcting what he perceived as a lack of public morality and civic responsibility in Nigerian society.[^26] The program sought to instill discipline in everyday Nigerian life, from forming orderly queues at bus stops to ensuring punctuality at workplaces.[^27] Civil servants who arrived late to work were humiliated and forced to do "frog jumps," while soldiers with whips enforced queue discipline at bus stops.[^28] Though controversial in its methods, the WAI resonated with many Nigerians who were frustrated with the chaos and disorder of the previous civilian administration.

### Democratic Presidency (2015-2023)

After three failed presidential bids in 2003, 2007, and 2011, Buhari finally achieved his democratic ambitions in 2015.[^29] In 2013, he had helped broker the merger of four major opposition parties to form the All Progressives Congress (APC), creating a formidable opposition coalition.[^30] On March 28, 2015, Buhari defeated incumbent President Goodluck Jonathan, making history as the first opposition candidate to defeat a sitting president in Nigeria's modern democratic era.[^31] This peaceful transfer of power was hailed as a significant milestone for Nigerian democracy.

Buhari's eight years as civilian president (2015-2023) saw several notable achievements. He fully implemented the Treasury Single Account (TSA), consolidating government revenues into a single account to promote transparency and curb leakages that had allowed corruption to flourish.[^32] This reform was credited with bringing billions of naira under government control that had previously been scattered across multiple accounts.

In 2021, Buhari signed the Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) into law after decades of legislative delays by previous administrations.[^33] This landmark legislation restructured Nigeria's oil sector with the aim of attracting investments and modernizing the industry that provides the bulk of government revenues. The passage of this long-delayed reform was considered one of his major accomplishments.

Infrastructure development was a centerpiece of Buhari's civilian presidency. His administration invested massively in transportation infrastructure, including the Lagos-Ibadan railway, the Abuja-Kaduna rail line, the Second Niger Bridge, and the modernization of airports across the country.[^34] These projects represented the most significant infrastructure push Nigeria had seen in decades.

In 2019, Buhari increased the minimum wage from ₦18,000 to ₦30,000, following years of agitation by organized labor.[^35] This represented a significant victory for Nigerian workers, even as inflation eroded some of its real value. He also signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill in 2022, introducing reforms such as electronic transmission of election results aimed at reducing manipulation and strengthening electoral transparency.[^36]

Buhari's agricultural policies included the Anchor Borrowers' Programme, which provided financing to farmers, particularly for rice production.[^37] Combined with the banning of rice imports through land borders, these policies were credited with increasing domestic rice production and reducing Nigeria's dependence on imported food. The administration also oversaw a dramatic expansion of higher education, with the number of universities in Nigeria rising from 128 in 2015 to 222 by 2023, including 10 new federal universities.[^38]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Buhari's tenure was marred by serious controversies that tarnished his legacy and led many Nigerians to view his presidency as a failure.

### Authoritarian Tendencies

During his military rule (1983-1985), Buhari established authoritarian policies that severely restricted civil liberties. In 1984, he passed Decree Number 4, the "Protection Against False Accusations Decree," which criminalized the publication of any material deemed to ridicule or bring government officials into disrepute, even if the information was true.[^39] Under this draconian law, two journalists, Nduka Irabor and Dele Thompson, were jailed for articles about Nigeria's diplomatic service reorganization.[^40] Decree Number 2 of 1984 gave security officials power to detain individuals deemed security risks for up to three months without charges, while strikes and demonstrations were banned.[^41] This authoritarian system became known as "Buharism."[^42]

The War Against Indiscipline, while popular with some, employed harsh methods that many considered excessive. Students over 17 caught cheating on exams faced 21 years in prison, while offenses like counterfeiting and arson could result in death sentences.[^43] These draconian punishments raised serious concerns about proportionality and human rights.

### Human Rights Violations

Buhari's democratic presidency was also marked by severe human rights abuses. Amnesty International documented "gross human rights violations" during his tenure between 2015 and 2023, citing mass killings, suppression of protests, attacks on journalists, and abuse of vulnerable women and girls.[^44]

The Zaria Massacre of December 2015 stands out as one of the most egregious incidents. The Nigerian military killed over 350 men, women, and children in Zaria between December 12-14, 2015.[^45] Amnesty International published evidence showing how the military burned people alive, razed buildings, and dumped victims' bodies in mass graves.[^46] Between August 2015 and August 2016, Nigerian security forces carried out extrajudicial executions resulting in the deaths of at least 150 peaceful pro-Biafra protesters.[^47]

The #EndSARS protests of October 2020 against police brutality culminated in the Lekki massacre on October 20, when Nigerian army soldiers opened fire on peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos.[^48] Amnesty International reported that at least 12 people died and hundreds were injured.[^49] Shockingly, President Buhari's televised statement two days later showed no sympathy for the slain protesters and did not even acknowledge that the massacre had occurred.[^50] His government branded media coverage of the massacre as "fake news" and continued to deny that killings occurred at Lekki.[^51]

Thousands of women and girls who survived Boko Haram captivity were further traumatized when Nigerian security forces who claimed to be rescuing them instead raped them, sometimes in exchange for food.[^52] At least 19 journalists and media practitioners were attacked, arrested, tortured, harassed, or threatened between January and September 2019 alone.[^53] Nigeria's ranking in the World Press Freedom Index fell from 111th in 2015 to 123rd by 2023.[^54]

### Economic Failures

Buhari's economic record was disastrous. Between 2016 and 2022, his government raised total revenues of ₦26.67 trillion but spent ₦60.64 trillion, leaving a deficit of ₦33.97 trillion.[^55] Nigeria's domestic debt soared from ₦8.84 trillion in December 2015 to ₦44.91 trillion by June 2023, while external debt rose from $7.35 billion to $37.2 billion over the same period.[^56] Unemployment rose from 10.4% in 2015 to 33.4% in 2020.[^57] Inflation reached 22.5%, while food inflation galloped to 24% as of April 2023.[^58] These statistics painted a picture of economic collapse that left millions of Nigerians worse off than when Buhari took office.

The naira redesign policy of 2022, approved by Buhari to fight corruption and vote buying, sparked severe cash shortages and economic hardship that caused widespread suffering.[^59] Many Nigerians saw this policy as poorly conceived and badly implemented, causing more harm than the problems it was meant to solve.

### Tribalism and Nepotism

Buhari's appointments were frequently criticized as being skewed in favor of the northern region and his Fulani kinsmen, fueling accusations of tribalism.[^60] His perceived affinity with Fulani herdsmen, despite widespread violence linked to some of them, further eroded public trust and reinforced perceptions that he favored his ethnic group over national interests.[^61]

### Security Failures

Despite campaigning on a promise to defeat Boko Haram, the terrorist group continued to launch attacks throughout Buhari's presidency, resulting in thousands of civilian deaths and the displacement of millions.[^62] Critics accused him of lacking a clear strategy and of allowing human rights abuses by security forces to continue unchecked.[^63] Banditry and kidnapping also surged during his tenure, making many parts of northern Nigeria virtually ungovernable.

## Personal Life

Muhammadu Buhari was married twice during his lifetime. His first marriage was to Safinatu Yusuf in 1971, when she was 18 years old.[^64] Safinatu served as Nigeria's First Lady during Buhari's military rule from 1983 to 1985.[^65] The couple divorced in 1988, and Safinatu passed away in 2006.[^66] The first marriage produced five children: Zulaihatu (deceased), Magajiya-Fatima, Hadizatu-Nana, Safinatu Lami, and Musa (deceased).[^67]

After divorcing his first wife, Buhari married Aisha Halilu on December 2, 1989.[^68] Aisha became First Lady when Buhari was elected president in 2015 and served in that capacity until he left office in 2023. The second marriage produced five children: four daughters (Aisha, Halima, Zahra, and Amina) and one son (Yusuf).[^69]

Among Buhari's children, Zahra Muhammadu Buhari-Indimi has been described as the most visible and socially engaged, combining education, entrepreneurship, and philanthropy in her public activities.[^70] Yusuf Muhammadu Buhari is the only son from his second marriage and attracted significant media attention during his father's presidency.[^71]

Tragically, two of Buhari's children from his first marriage, Musa and Zulaihat, died at young ages.[^72] At the time of his death in 2025, Buhari was survived by eight children: seven daughters and one son.[^73]

Buhari was known for his austere personal lifestyle and reputation for personal integrity. Even his critics acknowledged that he lived modestly and was not personally corrupt in the traditional Nigerian sense of amassing wealth through public office. He was a devout Muslim whose faith played a central role in his life and worldview. His personality was often described as rigid, aloof, and inflexible, traits that his supporters saw as principled determination but his critics viewed as stubbornness and inability to adapt.

## Legacy

Muhammadu Buhari died on July 13, 2025, in a London clinic at approximately 4:30 pm (15:30 UTC) following a prolonged illness, reportedly from leukemia.[^74] He was 82 years old. His remains were flown back to Nigeria and buried in the backyard of his home in Daura on July 15, 2025, in accordance with Islamic principles.[^75] A military parade and 21-gun salute honored the former president at the airport before his body was transported to his hometown.[^76]

Buhari's legacy is deeply contested and will likely remain so for generations. He was Nigeria's second-longest serving leader, having ruled as military head of state from 1983 to 1985 and as democratic president from 2015 to 2023, for a combined total of nearly ten years in power.[^77]

On the positive side of the ledger, Buhari made history by peacefully handing over power to Bola Ahmed Tinubu in 2023, thereby reinforcing Nigeria's fragile but enduring commitment to democracy.[^78] His 2015 electoral victory and the subsequent peaceful transfer of power from an incumbent demonstrated that democratic alternation was possible in Nigeria. His infrastructure projects, particularly in rail and road transportation, represented tangible improvements that will benefit Nigeria for decades. The passage of the Petroleum Industry Act ended decades of legislative paralysis on oil sector reform.

However, the negative aspects of his legacy loom large. The dramatic increase in Nigeria's debt burden, the rise in unemployment and inflation, and the general deterioration of economic conditions left Nigeria worse off economically than when he took office. His administration's human rights record, from the Zaria massacre to the Lekki shootings, represents a dark stain that cannot be erased. The suppression of press freedom and civil liberties during his tenure marked a regression in Nigeria's democratic development.

Perhaps most damaging to Buhari's legacy is the widespread perception that he failed to deliver on his promises. Elected on a platform of fighting corruption, improving security, and revitalizing the economy, he left office with corruption still rampant, insecurity worse than ever, and the economy in shambles. The hope and optimism that greeted his 2015 victory had turned to disillusionment and disappointment by 2023.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite the numerous criticisms, Buhari retained defenders who viewed his legacy more favorably. To his supporters, Buhari remained "the embodiment of integrity in a political system notoriously soaked in patronage and corruption."[^79] His admirers believed that his return to power in 2015 represented "Nigeria's chance at moral and institutional redemption."[^80]

Supporters pointed to concrete achievements, particularly in infrastructure development. His administration launched large-scale road, rail, and agricultural projects that represented significant investments in Nigeria's future.[^81] The Anchor Borrowers' Programme, which supported agriculture, was credited with boosting domestic food production.[^82] Major rail projects, completed roads and bridges, and reforms in oil and gas represented tangible accomplishments.[^83]

Economic data cited by supporters showed that within two years of the Buhari administration, exports more than doubled from 2015 records, with agriculture exports growing 180.7% by 2017, raw material exports growing 154.2%, solid minerals growing 565%, and manufactured goods exports increasing 26.8%.[^84] Supporters also credited Buhari with the "massive success" of pushing through the Petroleum Industry Bill, which previous administrations had attempted but failed to pass.[^85]

Scholar John N. Paden, author of "Muhammadu Buhari: The Challenges of Leadership in Nigeria," presented a more sympathetic portrayal of Buhari as a leader grappling with Nigeria's complex challenges.[^86] To admirers, Buhari was "a patriot who fought for a better Nigeria, laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity."[^87]

Buhari's northern support base, especially among rural populations, low-income earners, and conservative communities, viewed him as a defender of their values and interests.[^88] His background gave him a strong cultural and religious connection to northern Nigeria, while his military career solidified his standing as a northern leader who consistently advocated for national unity and social justice.[^89]

To his supporters, Buhari remained "a symbol of moral fortitude, personal discipline, and commitment to a Nigeria that works."[^90] They argued that many of his failures resulted from structural problems beyond any single leader's control and that history would vindicate his intentions, even if his execution was flawed.

### Negative Views

Critics, however, offered a much harsher assessment. According to openDemocracy, "the harms he inflicted on freedom of speech and the rule of law deserve special attention."[^91] The analysis continued: "More specifically, Buhari stripped each layer of protection that gives citizens a fighting chance in a democracy, one by one."[^92]

One scholarly study argued that "sustained poor political leadership has dealt serious blow on the survival of democracy as well as stifled national development in Nigeria especially under the Buhari administration."[^93] Rather than being the "reformed democrat" he had been marketed as, critics argued that "Buhari brought some of the darkness and regression of the military era to a new generation."[^94]

The suppression of freedom of expression and media freedom "was the most stark it had ever been in Nigeria's democratic era."[^95] By 2021, seven years into Buhari's democratic rule, the Nigerian Union of Journalists had recorded 300 violations affecting about 500 journalists, media workers, and media houses.[^96] The seven-month Twitter ban imposed by Buhari's government was seen as emblematic of his authoritarian instincts.[^97]

Academic assessments characterized his presidency as "marred by economic mismanagement, a failure to implement bold structural reforms, ethnic favouritism, and an unfulfilled promise of change."[^98] The scholarly consensus among critics was that "Buhari's mark on Nigeria's development trajectory was mixed," with the analysis concluding that "Buhari's second coming as Nigeria's leader carried high expectations, but he under-delivered."[^99]

The economic statistics tell a damning story. The massive accumulation of debt, the surge in unemployment and inflation, and the general economic decline contradicted his promises of economic revival. Critics noted that Nigeria became the poverty capital of the world during his tenure, with more Nigerians living in extreme poverty than in any other country.

The Conversation summed up the critical view: "To some, he was a principled nationalist who sought to bring order to a chaotic nation. To others, he was a rigid and underperforming leader, aloof to public suffering and blind to the nuances of a modern democracy."[^100] For many critics, the latter view was far more accurate than the former.
