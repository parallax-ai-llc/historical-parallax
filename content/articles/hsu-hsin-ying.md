## Summary

Hsu Hsin-ying (徐欣瑩; born April 23, 1972) is a Taiwanese politician and civil engineer who has served multiple terms in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan representing Hsinchu County. Known for her unconventional political journey, she began as a Kuomintang (KMT) member, founded her own party—the Minkuotang (Republican Party)—in 2015, ran as vice presidential candidate alongside James Soong in 2016, and eventually rejoined the KMT in 2022.[^1] Her career has been marked by significant electoral achievements, including receiving the highest vote count of any legislative candidate in 2012, as well as controversies surrounding her party switching and political allegiances.[^2]

## Early Life and Background

Hsu Hsin-ying was born on April 23, 1972, in Xinfeng Township, Hsinchu County, Taiwan, into a family with deep roots in both politics and education.[^3] Her father, Hsu Ching-lan (徐鏡蘭), was a graduate of National Taiwan Normal University who became mayor of Xinfeng Township at the age of 34, earning recognition as the first "outstanding" mayor in Hsinchu County.[^4] Her mother, Chien Pai-he (簡百合), graduated from National Chengchi University's Department of Education and worked as a guidance counselor at Xinfeng Junior High School.[^5] Growing up in this politically and academically oriented household profoundly influenced Hsu's future trajectory.

Hsu's early education took place entirely within her hometown. She attended Shanzaki Elementary School (山崎國民小學) in Xinfeng Township and later Xinfeng Junior High School (新豐國民中學).[^6] After completing her secondary education, she moved to Taipei for high school before pursuing higher education in engineering. She earned her bachelor's degree in engineering from National Cheng Kung University, one of Taiwan's most prestigious institutions.[^7] 

Demonstrating strong academic aptitude, Hsu continued her studies at National Chiao Tung University (now part of National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University), where she completed a master's degree in civil engineering in 1997.[^8] She remained at the same institution to pursue doctoral studies, earning her Ph.D. in civil engineering in 2007.[^9] This solid foundation in engineering would later distinguish her from many career politicians, providing her with technical expertise that informed her legislative work. Her younger brother, Hsu Shih-hsun (徐世勳), currently serves as the Director of Taipei City's Environmental Protection Bureau, continuing the family's tradition of public service.[^10]

## Rise to Power

Hsu Hsin-ying's entry into electoral politics began in 2005 when she first ran for a position on the Hsinchu County Council as an independent candidate, though this initial attempt was unsuccessful.[^11] Undeterred by this early defeat, she organized another bid for the Legislative Yuan in 2008, which also ended in failure.[^12] These early setbacks would prove to be valuable learning experiences for her subsequent political career.

A turning point came in 2009 when Hsu made the strategic decision to join the Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwan's oldest political party and the dominant force in pan-Blue politics.[^13] With the institutional backing and resources of the KMT, she successfully won a seat on the Hsinchu County Council, marking her first electoral victory.[^14] This success positioned her well for a run at higher office.

In the 2012 Legislative Yuan elections, Hsu achieved a remarkable breakthrough. Running as the KMT candidate for Hsinchu County, she won an unprecedented 171,466 votes—the highest total received by any single candidate in that year's legislative elections.[^15] This extraordinary performance demonstrated her strong appeal to voters in her home constituency and established her as a rising star within the KMT. Her background as a civil engineer with a Ph.D., combined with her family's political legacy in Xinfeng Township, created a compelling profile that resonated with voters in Hsinchu County, a traditionally pan-Blue stronghold.

The magnitude of her 2012 victory gave Hsu significant political capital and independence within the party structure. This electoral mandate would later embolden her to challenge party leadership and eventually strike out on her own political path, demonstrating that her power base was rooted in her personal connection with constituents rather than solely in party affiliation.

## Major Achievements

Hsu Hsin-ying's most significant achievement came with her historic performance in the 2012 Legislative Yuan elections, where she secured 171,466 votes—more than any other legislative candidate that year.[^16] This remarkable feat demonstrated her exceptional ability to mobilize voters and established her as one of Taiwan's most effective campaigners. Her success was particularly noteworthy given that Hsinchu County, while traditionally pan-Blue, had seen competitive races in previous elections.

In March 2015, following her departure from the KMT, Hsu founded the Minkuotang (民國黨), also known as the Republican Party, becoming the party's first chairperson.[^17] The founding assembly was held on March 18, 2015, and the party positioned itself as part of the Pan-Blue Coalition while seeking to return the KMT to what Hsu described as its "traditional roots."[^18] The party's flag featured the National Emblem of the Republic of China on a golden background, symbolizing its aim of reviving and enriching the nation.[^19] The establishment of the Minkuotang represented a bold political gambit—attempting to create a new political force that could appeal to disaffected KMT voters while maintaining pan-Blue ideological commitments.

In November 2015, People First Party (PFP) chairman James Soong selected Hsu as his vice presidential running mate for the 2016 presidential election.[^20] This represented a significant elevation for Hsu, who had only been in the Legislative Yuan for one term. The PFP–MKT coalition became the first pair of candidates to register for the election on November 23, 2015.[^21] The Soong-Hsu ticket campaigned on a platform of being "bluer than the Blue, greener than the Green," attempting to transcend the traditional pan-Blue versus pan-Green divide.[^22] Though the ticket ultimately finished third, it garnered 1,285,953 votes (12.84% of the total), a respectable showing that demonstrated Hsu's ability to appeal to voters beyond her Hsinchu County base.[^23]

Following her unsuccessful magistrate bid in 2018 and the merger of the Minkuotang into the Congress Party Alliance in January 2019, Hsu demonstrated remarkable political resilience.[^24] After running unsuccessfully for the Legislative Yuan on the Congress Party Alliance ticket in 2020, she made the strategic decision to rejoin the KMT in May 2022.[^25] This move proved prescient—she successfully won reelection to the Legislative Yuan in the 2024 elections, marking her political comeback and demonstrating her enduring appeal to Hsinchu County voters.[^26]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Hsu Hsin-ying's political career has been marked by significant controversies, particularly regarding her pattern of party affiliation changes. The most prominent criticism centers on what detractors have characterized as opportunistic party switching. After building her political career within the KMT and achieving her breakthrough 2012 victory under the party banner, Hsu left the KMT in January 2015 to found the Minkuotang, citing the party's "lack of reforms over the years under Chairman Eric Chu."[^27]

Critics have questioned the timing and motivations of her party movements. When she attempted to defend her 2015 departure from the KMT in a 2024 video, Hsu claimed her reasoning was "curve to save the nation" (曲線救國), suggesting she left to expand the party's territory.[^28] This explanation was met with harsh criticism. Political commentators accused her of openly admitting that she left the KMT after the 2014 Sunflower Movement damaged the party, "pretending to surrender to the green camp, waiting for the KMT to recover before returning."[^29] One analysis particularly criticized her timing, noting that "she left the party when it was weakest and returned when it was strongest, which would make party colleagues feel discouraged."[^30]

Her electoral campaigns following her departure from the KMT have also drawn criticism for allegedly splitting the pan-Blue vote. In both the 2016 presidential election (as James Soong's running mate) and the 2018 Hsinchu County magistrate race, critics argued that her candidacies divided pan-Blue voters, potentially costing the KMT victories in close contests.[^31] In the 2018 magistrate race, she finished second with 32.29% of the vote, losing to KMT candidate Yang Wen-ke, who benefited from a unified pan-Blue vote after Hsu's departure.[^32]

Following her loss in the 2018 magistrate election, Hsu resigned from the Minkuotang leadership on November 29, 2018.[^33] The party subsequently merged with the Congress Party Alliance on January 25, 2019, marking the first instance of a political party merger in the history of the Republic of China.[^34] Critics viewed this as evidence that the Minkuotang had failed to establish itself as a viable independent political force, existing primarily as a vehicle for Hsu's personal political ambitions.

Additional controversy emerged regarding the Minkuotang's funding sources. Soon after its founding in 2015, allegations surfaced that the party was funded for religious causes, after it was revealed that prominent religious figure Zen Master Wujue Miaotian was supporting the party for the 2016 general election.[^35] These revelations raised questions about the independence and true objectives of the organization.

## Personal Life

Information about Hsu Hsin-ying's personal life beyond her political career and family background remains relatively limited in public sources. Unlike some politicians who actively share details about their marriages and children, Hsu has maintained a more private approach to her personal affairs, with available sources making no mention of a spouse or children.[^36]

Hsu's identity appears strongly tied to her hometown of Xinfeng Township, where she has maintained deep community connections throughout her political career. In December 2023, she established a joint campaign headquarters in Xinfeng, her hometown, demonstrating her continued rootedness in the community where she grew up and where her father served as mayor.[^37] This connection to her local community has been a consistent theme throughout her political career, with her electoral strength consistently centered in Hsinchu County.

Her family's continued involvement in public service extends beyond her own career. Her younger brother, Hsu Shih-hsun (徐世勳), currently serves as the Director of Taipei City's Environmental Protection Bureau, indicating that the family tradition of public service established by her father continues into the next generation.[^38] The influence of her parents—particularly her father's political career and her mother's educational work—appears to have profoundly shaped her worldview and career trajectory.

As a civil engineer with a Ph.D. from National Chiao Tung University, Hsu brings technical expertise to her legislative work that distinguishes her from many career politicians. Her academic background in engineering, combined with her family's political legacy, creates a unique profile that blends technical competency with political acumen. This combination has likely contributed to her electoral appeal and her ability to address infrastructure and development issues relevant to Hsinchu County constituents.

## Legacy

Hsu Hsin-ying's political legacy is complex and still evolving, representing both the possibilities and pitfalls of attempting to forge an independent path in Taiwan's entrenched two-party system. Her most enduring achievement may be her demonstration that individual politicians can build personal electoral bases strong enough to transcend party affiliation—her record-breaking 2012 performance and her successful 2024 comeback after years outside the KMT testify to her personal electoral strength.

The founding of the Minkuotang in 2015 represented an ambitious attempt to create a new political force within Taiwan's pan-Blue camp. Though the party ultimately failed to establish itself as a permanent fixture and merged with the Congress Party Alliance in 2019, it contributed to the broader "Third Force" movement in Taiwanese politics that emerged following the 2014 Sunflower Movement.[^39] This movement sought to establish what advocates called a "new politics," free from what they perceived as corruption in both the pan-Blue and pan-Green camps and transcending the pro-unification versus pro-independence divide.[^40]

Hsu's vice presidential run with James Soong in 2016, while unsuccessful, demonstrated the potential for pan-Blue coalition building beyond the KMT. The ticket's 12.84% vote share, representing nearly 1.3 million voters, showed that a significant portion of the electorate remained open to alternatives to the major parties.[^41] However, the fact that the Minkuotang lost its only Legislative Yuan seat in that election also highlighted the challenges facing third-party movements in Taiwan's political system.

Her career trajectory—from KMT rising star to party founder to vice presidential candidate to political comeback—has made her a case study in the complexities of Taiwan's evolving political landscape. For supporters, she represents an independent-minded politician willing to challenge party orthodoxy and strike out on her own principles. For critics, she exemplifies opportunistic party switching and the prioritization of personal political advancement over institutional loyalty.

Her successful return to the KMT and reelection in 2024 suggests that Hsinchu County voters have ultimately been willing to forgive or overlook her party switching, valuing her representation of their interests over strict party loyalty. This may reflect a broader trend in Taiwan toward candidate-centered rather than party-centered politics, where voters increasingly make decisions based on individual politicians rather than party labels.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and political analysts have praised Hsu Hsin-ying for her willingness to challenge Taiwan's rigid party structures and attempt to create alternative political vehicles. Her 2012 electoral performance—receiving more votes than any other legislative candidate that year with 171,466 ballots—is widely recognized as a remarkable achievement that demonstrated exceptional political skills and deep constituent connections.[^42]

Political observers have noted that Hsu represents a new generation of Taiwanese politicians who combine technical expertise with political acumen. Her Ph.D. in civil engineering from National Chiao Tung University and her professional background distinguish her from career politicians who lack specialized knowledge.[^43] This combination of academic credentials and political effectiveness has been viewed as a model for the kind of competent, educated leadership Taiwan needs to address complex policy challenges.

Defenders of her party switching argue that her departures from established parties reflected principled disagreements rather than mere opportunism. When she left the KMT in 2015, she cited the party's "lack of reforms over the years under Chairman Eric Chu," positioning herself as someone willing to sacrifice the security of major party affiliation to advocate for necessary changes.[^44] From this perspective, her willingness to found the Minkuotang represented political courage and a commitment to her vision of what the pan-Blue movement should represent.

Her selection as James Soong's vice presidential running mate in 2016 was interpreted by some as recognition of her political talent and potential. Despite serving only one term in the Legislative Yuan at that time, she was chosen over more senior politicians, suggesting that party leaders saw her as someone who could appeal to younger voters and those disaffected with traditional party politics.[^45] The Soong-Hsu ticket's platform of transcending the "Blue-Green" divide resonated with voters seeking alternatives to the entrenched partisan divisions in Taiwan.

### Negative Views

Critics have been harsh in their assessment of Hsu Hsin-ying's political career, particularly focusing on what they characterize as opportunistic party switching and vote splitting that has damaged pan-Blue electoral prospects. Political commentators have accused her of timing her party affiliations to maximize personal political advantage rather than adhering to consistent principles.[^46]

The most pointed criticism emerged when Hsu attempted to justify her 2015 KMT departure with the "curve to save the nation" explanation in 2024. Critics savaged this justification, with one commentary stating that she "openly admitted to leaving the KMT after the Sunflower Movement damaged the party, pretending to surrender to the green camp, waiting for the KMT to recover before returning."[^47] This interpretation painted her as fundamentally disloyal and willing to abandon the party during its most difficult period, only to return when it regained strength. As one analysis noted: "she left the party when it was weakest and returned when it was strongest, which would make party colleagues feel discouraged."[^48]

Her electoral campaigns after leaving the KMT have been criticized for splitting the pan-Blue vote in crucial elections. In both the 2016 presidential race and the 2018 Hsinchu County magistrate election, analysts argued that her candidacies divided pan-Blue voters, potentially costing victories in close contests.[^49] In 2018, when she ran for Hsinchu County magistrate and finished second with 32.29% of the vote, critics pointed out that her presence in the race may have prevented a more decisive pan-Blue victory.[^50]

The rapid collapse of the Minkuotang—from founding in March 2015 to merger with another party in January 2019—has been cited as evidence that it never represented a genuine political movement but rather served primarily as a vehicle for Hsu's personal ambitions.[^51] The party's failure to win any seats in the 2016 legislative elections, despite Hsu's role as vice presidential candidate, suggested it lacked sustainable grassroots support.[^52]

Allegations about the Minkuotang's funding sources have also damaged Hsu's reputation. Revelations that prominent religious figure Zen Master Wujue Miaotian was supporting the party raised questions about whether it genuinely represented a political movement or was instead funded for purposes beyond transparent democratic politics.[^53]
