## Summary

Leslie "Les" Herbert Wexner is an American billionaire businessman who founded L Brands (now Bath & Body Works, Inc.), the parent company of Victoria's Secret, Bath & Body Works, and formerly other retail brands. For decades, Wexner was celebrated as one of retail's most successful entrepreneurs. However, his extensive and mysterious financial and personal relationship with Jeffrey Epstein has raised profound questions that remain largely unanswered. Wexner's relationship with Epstein was unlike any other in Epstein's network—Epstein managed Wexner's fortune, had power of attorney over his affairs, and received extraordinary transfers of assets. The nature and purpose of this relationship remains one of the most puzzling aspects of the Epstein scandal.

### The Manhattan Townhouse

The Upper East Side mansion became central to Epstein's operation:

- Location for meetings with powerful individuals
- Featured massage rooms and other concerning amenities

**Victims' Accounts**:
- Multiple victims described abuse at this location
- Mansion's opulence used to intimidate and impress

**The Question**:
- Did Wexner know how the property was being used?
- Why gift such valuable asset?
- What was Wexner told about Epstein's use?

### The Private Jet

The Boeing 727 became the "Lolita Express":

**Epstein's Use**:
- Transported victims between locations
- Traveled with celebrities, politicians, others
- Allegedly site of abuse during flights

**Wexner's Knowledge**:
- When did he learn about jet's use?

Troubling connections emerged between Epstein and Victoria's Secret:

**Epstein's Access**:

## Wexner's Response to Epstein's Crimes

### Claims of Ignorance

When Epstein's crimes became public, Wexner claimed:

- "Shocked and sickened" by Epstein's crimes
- "Profound regret" over association
- Terminated relationship in 2007 after "evidence of his offensive behavior"
- Never witnessed or knew of illegal activity

### Timeline Questions

Wexner's claimed timeline raises questions:

**2008**: Epstein's first conviction (Wexner claims already separated)
**2007**: Wexner says he learned of "offensive behavior"
**Question**: What was the "offensive behavior" if not the criminal investigation?

### The $46 Million "Misappropriation"

Wexner claimed Epstein:
- "Misappropriated" $46 million
- Did so without Wexner's knowledge
- Never repaid or acknowledged

**Questions**:
- How could someone with power of attorney "misappropriate"?
- What was money used for?
- Why no legal action if stolen?
- Is $46 million the total or partial amount?
