## Summary

Linji Yixuan was the Chinese Chan master who founded the Linji school, which became the most influential Chan lineage in East Asia (known as Rinzai in Japan). He was famous for his shouting, hitting, and radical teaching methods designed to shock students into enlightenment. His recorded sayings (Linji lu) are one of the most important Chan texts. His teaching emphasized the 'true person of no rank' — the buddha-nature within each person.
