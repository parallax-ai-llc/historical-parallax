## Summary

Ibn Sahl was a Persian physicist and mathematician who discovered the law of refraction (Snell's law) in 984, over 600 years before Willebrord Snellius. His manuscript On Burning Mirrors and Lenses contains the first known accurate description of the law of refraction of light, demonstrated through the design of lenses with no geometric aberrations.
