## Summary

Harold Urey was an American chemist who won the 1934 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of deuterium (heavy hydrogen). He made major contributions to isotope chemistry and was instrumental in developing isotope separation methods used in the Manhattan Project. His later work on the origin of the Earth's atmosphere and the Miller-Urey experiment on the origin of life were groundbreaking.
