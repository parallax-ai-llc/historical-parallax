## Summary

Evagrius Ponticus was a Christian monk and ascetic writer who was one of the most influential spiritual writers of the Desert Fathers. He developed the concept of the 'eight evil thoughts' which later became the Seven Deadly Sins in Western Christianity through the adaptation by Pope Gregory I. He systematized the contemplative theology of Origen and the desert monks. His works on prayer and the stages of spiritual progress deeply influenced Eastern Christian monasticism.
