## Summary

Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr., known as "Bongbong," is the 17th and current president of the Philippines, serving since June 30, 2022[^1]. Born September 13, 1957, he is the only son of former president and dictator Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and former first lady Imelda Marcos[^2]. His 2022 electoral victory with 58.77% of the vote marked the return of the Marcos family to power 36 years after they were ousted during the 1986 People Power Revolution[^3]. His presidency has been characterized by economic recovery efforts, infrastructure development, and controversy over his family's unresolved historical crimes and unpaid taxes[^4].

---

## Early Life and Background

Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. was born on September 13, 1957, at a hospital in Santa Mesa, Manila, Philippines[^5]. As the second child and only son of Ferdinand Marcos Sr. and Imelda Marcos, he was born into political royalty—his father was then the representative for the second district of Ilocos Norte and would become a senator just two years later[^6]. His godparents at baptism included prominent personalities who would later become key allies of his father's regime, including Eduardo "Danding" Cojuangco Jr. and pharmaceuticals magnate Jose Yao Campos[^7].

Growing up during his father's rise to power, Marcos received his early education at the Institución Teresiana in Quezon City and La Salle Green Hills in Mandaluyong for kindergarten and elementary education[^8]. In 1970, as his father's authoritarian rule began to solidify, the 13-year-old Marcos was sent to England, where he lived and studied at Worth School, an all-boys Benedictine institution in West Sussex[^9]. He completed his secondary education there in 1974, two years after his father declared martial law in the Philippines[^10].

Marcos went on to earn a Special Diploma in Social Studies from Oxford University in 1978[^11]. He also attended the prestigious Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania but did not complete the program[^12]. During these formative years abroad, Marcos experienced life as the privileged son of a dictator while the Philippines underwent massive human rights abuses, with thousands tortured, killed, and disappeared under his father's martial law regime[^13].

His education and upbringing were marked by the stark contradiction between his family's opulent lifestyle—funded by billions of dollars plundered from the Philippine treasury—and the suffering of millions of Filipinos under authoritarian rule[^14]. This duality would follow him throughout his political career, as he simultaneously benefited from his family name while attempting to distance himself from its darkest chapters.

---

## Rise to Power

Marcos's political career began remarkably early, even by Philippine standards. In 1980, at just 23 years old, he was elected vice governor of Ilocos Norte, running unopposed with the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party of his father, who was then ruling the Philippines under martial law[^15]. This position gave him his first taste of political power during one of the most repressive periods in Philippine history.

In 1983, still only 26, Marcos became governor of Ilocos Norte[^16]. His tenure was abruptly cut short in February 1986 when the People Power Revolution ousted his father's regime, forcing the entire Marcos family to flee into exile in Hawaii[^17]. The family's escape came amid revelations of massive corruption, with investigations eventually uncovering billions of dollars in stolen wealth, thousands of pairs of shoes belonging to his mother, and evidence of systematic human rights abuses[^18].

After years in exile, Marcos returned to Philippine politics in 1992, winning election as representative of Ilocos Norte's second district, serving from 1992 to 1995[^19]. In 1995, he attempted to run for the Senate under the NPC-led coalition but suffered a humiliating defeat, placing only 16th[^20]. Undeterred, he successfully ran again for governor of Ilocos Norte in 1998, holding that position until 2007—a period during which he consolidated his political base in the family's traditional stronghold[^21].

Marcos returned to the House of Representatives from 2007 to 2010, representing Ilocos Norte's second district once more[^22]. His political trajectory continued upward when he entered the Senate of the Philippines under the Nacionalista Party in 2010, serving a single six-year term until 2016[^23]. As senator, he worked on various legislative initiatives while carefully rebuilding the Marcos brand and challenging the historical narrative of his father's dictatorship[^24].

In 2016, Marcos made his first bid for national executive office, running for vice president. He narrowly lost to Camarines Sur representative Leni Robredo, but refused to accept the results, filing an electoral protest that would drag on for years and ultimately be dismissed[^25]. This loss, however, did not deter his ambitions—instead, it galvanized a sophisticated social media campaign that would prove crucial to his eventual presidential victory.

The intervening years saw Marcos and his allies orchestrate what observers have described as a massive disinformation campaign, using Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok to rewrite history and portray the martial law era as a "golden age"[^26]. This systematic historical revisionism, combined with strategic alliances—most notably with Sara Duterte, daughter of outgoing president Rodrigo Duterte—culminated in his landslide victory in the May 2022 presidential election[^27].

## Major Achievements

### 2022 Presidential Victory

Marcos's most significant political achievement came in May 2022 when he won the presidential election with 31,629,783 votes, representing 58.77% of the total votes cast—approximately 16.5 million votes ahead of his closest rival, Vice President Leni Robredo[^28]. He became the first presidential candidate to be elected by a majority since the establishment of the Fifth Republic in 1986[^29]. This historic victory marked the Marcos family's return to Malacañang Palace for the first time since the People Power Revolution, a comeback that many political observers considered impossible just a decade earlier[^30].

The election victory was proclaimed official on May 25, 2022, and Marcos was inaugurated as the 17th president of the Philippines on June 30, 2022[^31]. His running mate, Sara Duterte, won the vice presidency separately, creating a powerful political alliance between two of the country's most prominent political dynasties[^32].

### Infrastructure Development

Continuing the previous administration's focus on infrastructure, Marcos launched the "Build Better More" (BBM) program, which superseded Duterte's "Build! Build! Build!" initiative by adding more infrastructure projects[^33]. The program encompasses 194 infrastructure projects across various sectors, with Infrastructure Flagship Projects valued at $176.7 billion[^34]. However, as of 2025, only eight projects have been completed, while 70 are ongoing, and almost 30 have been approved for implementation[^35].

Notable completed projects include the inauguration on November 15, 2024, of Phase 1 of the Cavite extension of the Light Rail Transit Line 1, which extended the LRT-1 by six kilometers to bring its total length to 26 kilometers[^36]. The Cebu-Negros-Panay backbone project was completed in April, stabilizing the region's power supply and reducing outages, at a cost of ₱67.9 billion[^37]. Additionally, Marcos approved ₱270 billion worth of key infrastructure projects during his first years in office[^38].

### Economic Policies

As president, Marcos signed into law the creation of the Maharlika Investment Fund, the first sovereign wealth fund of the Philippines[^39]. This controversial initiative aims to pool government funds to invest in infrastructure and other development projects, though critics have raised concerns about governance and potential misuse[^40].

Marcos's economic agenda focused heavily on attracting foreign investments, especially targeting sectors like renewable energy, infrastructure, and mining[^41]. His administration inherited surging inflation driven by global uncertainty and post-pandemic disruptions, but by 2025, inflation had decreased to 1.4%—the lowest it had been in over five years[^42]. The administration supported micro, small, and medium enterprises with ₱8.16 billion in loans, with over 154,000 small business owners receiving support to recover and expand[^43].

### Energy and Digital Transformation

On energy policy, the Marcos administration aggressively promoted renewable energy, setting targets for renewables to constitute 35 percent of the power mix by 2030 and 50 percent by 2040[^44]. In terms of digital transformation and consumer protection, Marcos signed the Anti-Financial Accounts Scamming Act (RA 12010), which protects financial consumers from fraudulent transactions, and the VAT on Digital Transactions Act (RA 12023)[^45].

### Agricultural Reforms

Marcos signed several agricultural laws, including the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act (RA 12022) and the Agricultural Tariffication Act (RA 12078), aimed at protecting Filipino farmers and consumers from unjust price hikes on essential commodities[^46].

### Foreign Policy Shift

Marcos's foreign policy has been characterized by efforts to reestablish closer ties with the United States, representing an abrupt shift from the China-oriented policies of the Duterte administration[^47]. This realignment has included strengthened military cooperation with the United States and a firmer stance on Philippine territorial claims in the South China Sea[^48].

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Tax Evasion Conviction and Unpaid Estate Taxes

One of the most persistent controversies dogging Marcos is his 1995 criminal conviction for tax evasion. On July 27, 1995, the Quezon City Regional Trial Court issued a guilty verdict for Marcos's nonpayment of taxes and failure to file income tax returns from 1982 to 1985 during his time as vice governor and governor of Ilocos Norte[^49]. The Court of Appeals sustained the conviction in 1997, fining him ₱36,000 but sparing him from prison time[^50]. Marcos filed an appeal at the Supreme Court but withdrew it in 2001, making the Court of Appeals decision final and executory[^51]. In 2021, the Quezon City court certified that Marcos had never paid the tax dues and fines[^52].

Even more controversial is the massive estate tax debt of the Marcos family. As the court-approved executor of his late father's estate, Marcos is directly liable to pay estate tax estimated at ₱203 billion (approximately $3.9 billion), including interests and penalties accrued over more than 30 years[^53]. According to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and the Philippine Commission on Good Governance, the original estate tax of ₱23 billion has ballooned to ₱203 billion due to decades of non-payment[^54]. Despite his family's immense wealth, Marcos has not paid "a single centavo" of this debt[^55].

### Historical Revisionism and Disinformation

Marcos won the presidency following what historians and analysts described as a years-long, well-organized campaign that sought to whitewash his father's brutal legacy through systematic historical revisionism[^56]. According to historian Francis Gealogo, President Marcos relied on "mythmaking" and benefited from "historical distortion about his father's regime that presented false narratives about the past"[^57].

The disinformation campaign utilized Facebook pages and groups, YouTube channels, and TikTok videos to reach Filipino voters, with about 72% of confirmed Marcos disinformation originating directly from social media rather than print sources[^58]. Data showed that 42.6% of Marcos's Twitter followers were fake accounts[^59]. The Marcoses' online revisionism initiative stretches back to the 2000s when the family was active on Friendster, Flickr, and other now-discontinued platforms[^60].

Journalist and Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa described the disinformation phenomenon as "death by a thousand cuts," whereby social media chips away at facts through bots and fake accounts[^61]. The campaign employed tactics across all platforms—Gen Z influencers on TikTok posted decontextualized historical clips painting Marcos as a hero and the martial law era as glorious, memes shared on Facebook decried political opponents, and YouTube channels engaged in historical revisionism[^62].

### Refusal to Acknowledge Martial Law Atrocities

The Philippines has officially recognized that 11,103 people were tortured and abused during the martial law period, with 2,326 killings and disappearances between 1972 and 1986[^63]. However, based on documentation by Amnesty International and other monitoring entities, historians believe the Marcos dictatorship was marked by 3,257 known extrajudicial killings, 35,000 documented tortures, 737 "disappeared," and 70,000 incarcerations[^64].

Despite overwhelming evidence, President Marcos has stated that apologizing to human rights victims under martial law is "a personal matter to the Marcos family"[^65]. He has dismissed stories of human rights abuses as "self-serving statements by politicians, self-aggrandizement narratives, pompous declarations, and political posturing and propaganda"[^66]. When victims commemorated martial law's 40th anniversary in 2012, Marcos Jr. dismissed their calls for an apology with similar language[^67].

### Legal Judgments Against the Family

Marcos and his mother, Imelda, are facing arrest in the United States for defying a court order to pay $353 million in restitution to human rights abuse victims[^68]. In 2011, the Hawaii District Court ruled them in contempt, fining them $353.6 million for not respecting an injunction from a 1992 judgment[^69]. This ruling was upheld by the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and is believed to be "the largest contempt award ever affirmed by an appellate court"[^70].

### Governance Concerns

According to a survey conducted by Publicus Asia from November 29 to December 4, 2023, more Filipinos became dissatisfied with the Marcos administration in less than two years, with economic concerns, rising inflation, joblessness, low wages, and a perceived lack of productivity being among the emerging factors[^71]. Human rights groups and martial law victims have warned that a Marcos presidency signals not only more efforts to rewrite history but also a further backslide in the country's human rights situation[^72].

## Personal Life

Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. is married to lawyer Louise "Liza" Cacho Araneta, a member of the prominent Araneta family[^73]. The couple met in New York City in 1989 and were married in Fiesole, Italy, on April 17, 1993[^74]. Their union brought together two of the Philippines' most influential families, adding to Marcos's political capital and social standing.

Louise Araneta-Marcos, born August 21, 1959, is a Filipino lawyer and academic who has served as the first lady of the Philippines since 2022[^75]. She studied law and graduated from Ateneo de Manila University, one of the Philippines' most prestigious institutions, and later completed postgraduate courses at New York University[^76]. A successful legal professional in her own right, she founded two law firms: MOST (Marcos, Ochoa, Serapio & Tan) Law Firm and M&A Associates[^77].

The couple has three sons: Ferdinand Alexander III, nicknamed "Sandro" (born 1994), Joseph Simon (born 1995), and William Vincent, known as "Vinny" (born 1997)[^78]. Sandro has followed his father into politics, raising both expectations and concerns about the continuation of dynastic politics in the Philippines[^79]. President Marcos has expressed in interviews his joy in seeing Sandro take up the political mantle, while also cherishing moments spent with Simon, whose achievements he celebrates in more private ways[^80]. Vinny graduated from Oxford Brookes University and is currently working as a software engineer, choosing a career path outside of politics[^81].

The Marcos family maintains residences in Metro Manila and continues to have strong connections to Ilocos Norte, the family's traditional political stronghold. Despite the controversies surrounding the family name, Marcos has cultivated an image as a devoted family man, often sharing moments with his wife and children on social media as part of his public relations strategy[^82].

Marcos's personality has been described by associates as reserved and calculated, in contrast to his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's bombastic style. He has maintained a more traditional, diplomatic approach to governance and public appearances, though critics argue this measured demeanor masks an unwillingness to confront his family's dark history and his personal legal obligations[^83].

---

## Legacy

### The Return of Dynastic Politics

Marcos's presidency represents one of the most remarkable political rehabilitations in modern history—the return to power of a family once synonymous with corruption, human rights abuses, and authoritarian excess[^84]. His electoral victory in 2022 has been interpreted by scholars as evidence of growing illiberalism in the Philippines and a broader trend toward populist, authoritarian leadership styles[^85]. The successful political comeback has raised concerns about democratic backsliding and the erosion of institutional memory regarding the horrors of martial law[^86].

### Impact on Historical Memory

Perhaps Marcos's most controversial legacy will be his role in reshaping collective memory of his father's dictatorship. Through systematic disinformation campaigns, the Marcos family successfully convinced millions of Filipinos—particularly younger voters who did not experience martial law—that the 1970s and 1980s represented a "golden age" for the Philippines[^87]. This narrative directly contradicts the scholarly consensus documenting the atrocities and economic mismanagement of that era[^88].

Martial law survivors and activist groups continue to protest against the administration, with demonstrations in Manila and international cities like New York, where protesters marched down Times Square chanting "Never Again"[^89]. Human rights advocates fear that the Marcos presidency signals the normalization of historical revisionism and sets a dangerous precedent for future authoritarian leaders[^90].

### Economic and Infrastructure Legacy

While it is still early in his presidency, Marcos's economic legacy appears mixed. His administration successfully brought down inflation from post-pandemic highs and maintained economic growth, but critics note these achievements built upon foundations laid by previous administrations[^91]. The ambitious "Build Better More" infrastructure program has shown limited progress, with only a small fraction of projects completed[^92].

The creation of the Maharlika Investment Fund represents a significant policy initiative, though its long-term impact remains uncertain, with governance concerns and questions about the fund's management and transparency[^93]. Marcos's pivot toward stronger US relations and away from China has reshaped Philippine foreign policy, though the full implications of this realignment are yet to be seen[^94].

### Unresolved Historical Debts

Marcos's refusal to acknowledge his family's crimes or pay their debts—both moral and financial—continues to define much of his legacy. The unpaid ₱203 billion estate tax and the $353 million contempt judgment from US courts represent tangible manifestations of the Marcos family's continued evasion of accountability[^95]. His presidency has allowed him to use state power to potentially shield himself from these obligations, raising questions about equal application of the law[^96].

### Influence on Democratic Norms

Researchers have concluded that Marcos's victory represents continuity with predecessor Rodrigo Duterte's illiberal populism rather than a break with it[^97]. The electoral success was attributed to misinformation, patronage, and populism, and should be understood as part of a broader shift in the country's political narrative toward acceptance of strongman leadership[^98]. This trend has implications far beyond Marcos's individual presidency, potentially reshaping Philippine democracy for generations to come.

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters of Marcos, particularly among his loyalist base in Ilocos Norte and among those nostalgic for the Marcos era, portray him as a competent administrator who has brought stability and economic progress to the Philippines[^99]. They point to infrastructure development initiatives, the decline in inflation rates, and efforts to modernize the Philippine economy through foreign investment and renewable energy development as evidence of effective governance[^100].

Marcos defenders argue that he should not be held responsible for the actions of his father and that his own political career demonstrates competence and dedication to public service[^101]. They highlight his long tenure as governor of Ilocos Norte, where supporters claim he delivered concrete development projects and improved local governance[^102]. His advocates also emphasize his diplomatic approach to foreign relations and his success in strengthening ties with both the United States and regional partners[^103].

Some political analysts have noted Marcos's pragmatic approach to governance and his ability to build coalitions across party lines, viewing this as a stabilizing force in Philippine politics[^104]. Supporters frame his election as the will of the people, emphasizing his overwhelming mandate with 31 million votes as evidence of public desire for his leadership[^105].

There is also an increasing trend among supporters to highlight what they claim were the economic achievements of the martial law era, strategically reviving the elder Marcos's legacy to evoke emotional responses from loyalists and supporters of authoritarian populism[^106]. These narratives, while contradicting historical evidence, have found resonance among portions of the Philippine population seeking simple explanations for complex economic problems[^107].

### Negative Views

The scholarly and human rights community maintains a starkly different view of the Marcos presidency. Despite a scholarly consensus documenting the atrocities and horrors of the Marcos dictatorship, critics argue that Bongbong Marcos has weaponized social media to systematically erase this historical truth[^108]. Historians like Francis Gealogo emphasize that Marcos relied on "mythmaking" and "historical distortion" to rehabilitate his family's image, fundamentally undermining democratic discourse[^109].

Human rights advocates and martial law survivors view Marcos's presidency as a profound betrayal of the sacrifices made during the People Power Revolution[^110]. They argue that his refusal to acknowledge his family's crimes, apologize to victims, or pay legal judgments represents a continuation of the impunity that characterized his father's regime[^111]. Maria Ressa, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been particularly vocal in criticizing the disinformation campaign that brought Marcos to power, describing it as an assault on truth itself[^112].

Critics point to Marcos's criminal tax evasion conviction and the family's massive unpaid estate tax as evidence of a continued pattern of lawlessness and elite impunity[^113]. The fact that someone with a criminal conviction and billions in unpaid taxes could be elected president is seen as symptomatic of deeper problems in Philippine democracy and rule of law[^114].

Political scientists and democracy advocates worry that Marcos's presidency, built on historical revisionism and disinformation, sets a dangerous precedent for other countries grappling with authoritarian legacies[^115]. The successful rehabilitation of the Marcos name through systematic manipulation of social media platforms raises concerns about the fragility of democratic institutions in the digital age[^116].

International observers have characterized Marcos's election as evidence of democratic backsliding in Southeast Asia, part of a broader regional trend toward illiberal governance[^117]. His presidency is often analyzed not as an isolated phenomenon but as part of a continuum with Rodrigo Duterte's authoritarian populism, representing a shift away from liberal democratic norms that had been established after 1986[^118].

Academic assessments emphasize that Marcos's victory was achieved through "misinformation, patronage, and populism" rather than through genuine policy achievements or ideological vision[^119]. Cornell University researchers analyzing the Marcos family's return to power concluded that it represents a fundamental challenge to historical truth and democratic accountability[^120].
