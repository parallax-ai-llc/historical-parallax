## Summary

On June 5, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy won the California Democratic presidential primary. He was now the frontrunner for the nomination, poised perhaps to follow his slain brother to the White House. Minutes after his victory speech at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, he was shot in a kitchen pantry. He died the next day at age 42. A Palestinian immigrant named Sirhan Sirhan was seized with a smoking gun. He has been in prison ever since. But was he the only shooter?[^1]

The "second gunman" theory in the RFK assassination is not a fringe fantasy—it has been taken seriously by forensic experts, eyewitnesses, and even Robert Kennedy Jr., who visited Sirhan in prison in 2017 and publicly stated his belief that Sirhan did not kill his father. The fatal shot entered behind Kennedy's right ear at point-blank range—but witnesses say Sirhan was in front of Kennedy. More bullets may have been fired than Sirhan's eight-shot revolver could hold. The physical evidence doesn't quite fit.[^2]

Sirhan, now in his 80s, has no memory of the shooting—a claim consistent either with trauma or, as his lawyers argued, with being a hypno-programmed "Manchurian candidate." Appeals courts have rejected new trials. But unlike his brother's assassination, RFK's death has a convicted killer who insists he's innocent, a victim's son who believes him, and forensic questions that have never been definitively resolved.[^3]

## The Event

### June 4-5, 1968

**California primary:**
- RFK won Democratic primary
- Crucial victory in presidential race
- Victory speech at Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles

**12:15 a.m. (June 5):**

### The Scene

## Sirhan Sirhan

### Who Is He?

**Background:**
- Born Jerusalem, 1944 (then British Mandate Palestine)
- Family fled to U.S. after 1948
- Christian Palestinian
- Grew up in Pasadena

**Motive (stated):**
- Angry at RFK's support for Israel

- Sirhan's diary: "RFK must die"

**The shooting:**

## The Second Gunman Theory

### The Autopsy Evidence

**Medical examiner Thomas Noguchi:**
- Fatal shot: Behind right ear
- Fired from 1-3 inches away
- Burned powder marks on skin
- Entry wound at back of head

**The problem:**
- Witnesses say Sirhan was 2-3 feet away, in front
- Kennedy facing Sirhan
- How could fatal shot come from behind at contact range?

**Noguchi himself:**
- Raised possibility of second gunman
- Testified about shot trajectory[^6]

### The Bullet Count

**Sirhan's gun:**
- 8-shot capacity
- All 8 rounds fired

**The wounds:**
- Kennedy: 3 bullets hit him
- 5 other victims wounded
- Some bullets went through victims
- Some went into ceiling/walls

**The mystery:**
- A 2004 audio analysis (Philip Van Praag) suggested 13 shots
- If true: Second gun required
- Disputed by other experts

**At minimum:**
- Questions about bullet accounting
- Some evidence possibly destroyed by LAPD[^7]

### Paul Schrade

**Who is he:**
- United Auto Workers official
- Walking behind Kennedy
- Shot in head (survived)

**His position:**
- Believes second gunman shot Kennedy
- First shot hit him (Schrade)
- Sirhan was "distraction"
- Has campaigned for new investigation decades

**At 2016 parole hearing:**
- Schrade told Sirhan: "You did not shoot Robert Kennedy"
- Urged his release

**A victim calling for the convicted shooter's freedom.**[^8]

### Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

**His position (2017):**
- Visited Sirhan in prison
- Publicly stated: Second gunman killed his father
- Called for new investigation
- Said Sirhan was not the assassin

**Family divided:**
- Other Kennedy family members: Various views
- RFK Jr.'s position is personal, not family consensus

**But:** Victim's son believing convicted killer is innocent is extraordinary.[^9]

## The Counter-Arguments

### Why Sirhan Probably Did It

**The case:**
- Sirhan was there, firing
- His diary showed premeditated intent
- Witnesses saw him shoot toward Kennedy
- Ballistic evidence (disputed) matched his gun

**The trajectory dispute:**
- Chaotic scene; witnesses unreliable
- Kennedy may have turned
- Contact wound: Maybe Sirhan got closer than remembered

**The audio analysis:**
- Disputed by other experts
- Not definitive

### Why No Trial?

**If there's doubt:**
- Courts have rejected every appeal
- Judges: Evidence doesn't warrant new trial
- Legal system: Case is closed

**But:** Legal certainty ≠ historical certainty

## The Lingering Questions

### What We Know

**Certain:**
- Sirhan was there, shooting
- Kennedy was shot from behind at close range
- 8 shots from Sirhan's gun

### What's Debated

**Disputed:**

- How many shots total?
- Destroyed evidence?
- Second shooter?

### What We'll Never Know

**Without new evidence:**
- Sirhan has no memory (genuine or feigned?)
- Key witnesses dead
- Physical evidence questions unresolved
- Case officially closed

---

## Why This Matters

### The 1968 Context

**A year of assassinations:**
- Martin Luther King Jr. (April 4)
- Robert F. Kennedy (June 5)
- Both in 1968
- Both changed American history

**RFK's path:**
- Likely Democratic nominee
- Possibly would have won presidency
- Vietnam War might have ended differently
- American history altered

### The Dynasty

**The Kennedy brothers:**
- JFK: Assassinated 1963
- RFK: Assassinated 1968
- Ted: Never became president (Chappaquiddick)

**The curse:** Real or imagined, the pattern is striking.[^10]
