## Summary

Fatmawati (February 5, 1923 – May 14, 1980) was Indonesia's first First Lady, serving from 1945 to 1967 as the third wife of founding president Sukarno. She is best known for hand-sewing the original Indonesian flag, the Bendera Pusaka, which was raised during the proclamation of independence on August 17, 1945. Beyond her symbolic contribution to independence, Fatmawati was a politically aware woman deeply involved in women's issues, though her personal experience with polygamy became a pivotal moment in Indonesia's women's rights movement. She was posthumously awarded the title of National Hero of Indonesia in 2000.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Fatmawati was born on February 5, 1923, in Bengkulu, on the western coast of Sumatra, specifically at the Tapak Paderi Coast.[^3] Her birth name was Fatimah, and she was the daughter of Hasan Din and Siti Chadijah, both members of the Minangkabau ethnic group from West Sumatra.[^4] One of her ancestors was a princess of the Sultanate of Inderapura, a Minangkabau kingdom, giving her family a connection to regional aristocracy.[^5]

Her father, Hasan Din, was a prominent figure in the Muhammadiyah Islamic reform movement in Bengkulu and worked as a businessman.[^6] Initially employed by the Dutch trading company Bersomij, Hasan Din later faced business difficulties and moved the family to Palembang, where he established a printing business to support them.[^7] Raised in a devout household emphasizing traditional Islamic values, Fatmawati's formative years were shaped by her family's involvement in Muhammadiyah activities, which promoted education and community welfare during Dutch colonial rule.[^8]

Fatmawati began her education at a People's School at age six, then continued to the Hollandsch Inlandsche School (HIS), a Dutch-language primary school.[^9] However, at her parents' request, she was transferred to a Muhammadiyah school in third grade, where she received an education grounded in Islamic principles.[^10] She was described as very active in organizations from elementary school onward, demonstrating early leadership qualities and social engagement.[^11]

## Rise to Prominence

Fatmawati's path to national prominence began unexpectedly in 1938 when she was just 15 years old. That February, Sukarno, then a leading nationalist figure, was exiled to Bengkulu by Dutch colonial authorities.[^12] During his exile, Sukarno became acquainted with Fatmawati's father, Hasan Din, the local head of the Muhammadiyah organization, and was permitted to teach religious and nationalist ideas at the Muhammadiyah school.[^13]

Among Sukarno's students was young Fatmawati, daughter of his host.[^14] The relationship between teacher and student evolved over the years as Fatmawati continued her education at a home economics school in Bengkulu. Seeking accommodation, she was invited by Sukarno to stay in his house, where she became part of the household, sharing a room with Ratna Djuami and another foster child.[^15] Sukarno, then twenty years her senior, grew fond of Fatmawati, and they frequently walked along Panjang Beach, discussing various topics.[^16] He initially served as a father figure but eventually became romantically involved with her, justifying the relationship by citing his wife Inggit Garnasih's inability to produce children during their nearly two-decade marriage.[^17]

In 1943, during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Fatmawati became Sukarno's third wife at the age of 20.[^18] This marriage positioned her to play a significant role in the upcoming independence movement. Her most famous contribution came in October 1944, when she sewed the red and white flag that would become Indonesia's national symbol.[^19] The flag was hand-stitched due to the lack of electricity for a sewing machine.[^20] Obtaining the materials proved challenging during wartime; Fatmawati asked a young man named Chairul Bahri to request flag fabric from Shimizu, a Japanese sympathizer of Indonesian independence, as fabrics were strictly controlled by Japanese authorities.[^21]

## Major Achievements

### The Bendera Pusaka and Indonesian Independence

Fatmawati's most enduring achievement was creating the Bendera Pusaka Sang Saka Merah Putih (The Sacred Red and White Heirloom Flag). On August 17, 1945, when Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence at 56 Pegangsaan Timur Street in Jakarta, it was Fatmawati's handmade flag that was hoisted.[^22] According to Sukarno's own account, "My wife [Fatmawati] made a flag of two pieces of cloth. A white piece of cloth and a red piece of cloth sewn together by hand."[^23]

In her memoir "Small Notes with Bung Karno" (2016), Fatmawati recounted the moment: "When I was about to step out of the door I heard a scream that the flag wasn't there yet, then I turned to take the flag I made when Thunder [her son Guntur] was still in the womb, a year and a half ago."[^24] She gave the flag to people present before heading to the ceremony venue. The flag was raised on a primitive bamboo flagstaff, not very high, but it became the most powerful symbol of Indonesian sovereignty.[^25]

The original Bendera Pusaka was hoisted annually during independence day ceremonies until 1968, when it was retired due to its fragile condition.[^26] Since then, replicas have been used for ceremonial purposes. The original flag is now preserved in a specialized room at the Presidential Palace (Istana Merdeka) in an airtight vitrine equipped with air conditioning to regulate temperature and humidity, with 24-hour military security.[^27]

### Role as First Lady During the National Revolution (1945-1950)

Fatmawati served as Indonesia's First Lady from the moment of independence in 1945.[^28] Her role went far beyond ceremonial duties during the turbulent period of the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949), when the young nation faced Dutch military attempts to reassert colonial control. When the government relocated to Yogyakarta in late 1946 to evade Allied and Dutch forces, Fatmawati accompanied Sukarno.[^29] During the first Dutch Military Aggression in Yogyakarta, Fatmawati took care of all the president's needs, including food preparation with whatever equipment and items were available, often in difficult jungle conditions.[^30]

She managed the presidential household during this provisional period when Yogyakarta functioned as Indonesia's capital from 1946 to 1949, and subsequently in Jakarta after the capital's return in 1950.[^31] Fatmawati carried out state duties including national and international visits, entertaining state guests from India, Pakistan, and other countries, representing the new nation with dignity during its formative years.[^32]

### Family and Children

Fatmawati and Sukarno had five children who would each make significant contributions to Indonesian society:[^33]

1. **Guntur Soekarnoputra** (born November 4, 1944) – The eldest son
2. **Megawati Sukarnoputri** (born 1947) – Who became Indonesia's fifth president and first female president from 2001 to 2004[^34]
3. **Rachmawati Sukarnoputri** (born September 27, 1949; died July 3, 2021) – A politician who was closest to her parents and wrote the memoir "Bapakku Ibukku: Dua manusia yang Kucinta dan Kukagumi" (My Father, My Mother: Two People I Love and Admire) in 1984[^35]
4. **Sukmawati Sukarnoputri** (born October 26, 1951) – The third daughter, who later converted from Islam to Hinduism in 2021[^36]
5. **Guruh Soekarnoputra** – The youngest child[^37]

### Social Welfare Work

Beyond her official duties, Fatmawati demonstrated genuine concern for the welfare of Indonesia's people, especially women and children. She established the Ibu Soekarno Foundation, which functions as a hospital for children with cancer, showing her commitment to healthcare and child welfare.[^38] This institution continues her legacy of compassionate service to vulnerable populations.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Polygamy Crisis

The most significant controversy of Fatmawati's life centered on her husband's decision to practice polygamy. In 1953, Sukarno announced his intention to marry Hartini, a woman from Solo (Java), as his fourth wife while remaining married to Fatmawati.[^39] Fatmawati, who was "notoriously opposed to polygamy," vehemently objected to this decision according to Islamic law.[^40]

The situation created enormous public controversy. When Sukarno married Hartini in 1954, Indonesian women held demonstrations against his endorsement of polygamy.[^41] Women's organizations, which had been advocating for marriage law reform since the early 1900s, saw the president's actions as a betrayal of their cause.[^42] Hartini moved her entire Solo household and five children into Bogor Palace and began entertaining friends, receiving officials, and "carrying on for all the world like Indonesia's First Lady, while Fatmawati shrank into the background."[^43]

In protest, women's organizations orchestrated deliberate snubs of Hartini. When she stepped down from planes at official events, delegation members would turn and march off, refusing to acknowledge her.[^44] These women consoled and advised Fatmawati, trying to encourage her to return to the palace and reestablish her rights.[^45]

Fatmawati ultimately opted to leave the State Palace on July 7, 1953, after Sukarno requested permission to wed Hartini, and moved to a separate residence on Sriwijaya Street in Jakarta.[^46] Despite this separation, she retained the title of First Lady for the remainder of Sukarno's presidency until 1967.[^47] However, the marriage was permanently damaged. Sukarno's relationship with Fatmawati "soured" after the Hartini marriage, and they maintained only formal contact thereafter.[^48]

### Impact on Women's Rights Movement

Fatmawati's personal crisis became a watershed moment for Indonesia's women's movement, though not in the way activists had hoped. She was initially not in favor of reforming marriage laws until she discovered her husband's intentions to marry again.[^49] Her decision to leave the palace rather than fight for legal reforms was described as "a major blow to the growing women's movement."[^50]

The controversy exposed the weakness of women's legal protections in Indonesia. Despite decades of advocacy by women's organizations, marriage law reform efforts stagnated. A marriage bill proposed in 1958 vanished from legislative discussion due to a Presidential Decree.[^51] The progression of women's rights was hampered by inefficient government action, women's limited representation in government, and ongoing indecision about changing marriage law.[^52] It would not be until 1974, under President Suharto's New Order regime, that comprehensive marriage law reform (Law No. 1 of 1974) was finally enacted.[^53]

### Absence from Sukarno's Funeral

The depth of Fatmawati's hurt was demonstrated most dramatically in her absence from Sukarno's funeral. Fatmawati never visited Sukarno during his final illness, and she missed his funeral on June 21, 1970, in Blitar, East Java, as confirmed by her son Guruh.[^54] While her children were present at the hospital when Sukarno died of kidney failure at age 69, Fatmawati remained at her Sriwijaya house.[^55]

According to Indonesian sources, Fatmawati was upset that Sukarno's body was laid out at Wisma Yaso (the home of another wife, Ratna Sari Dewi) rather than at her residence.[^56] Although absent, she sent a flower arrangement with a handwritten message, a gesture that acknowledged their shared history while maintaining her dignity.[^57]

---

## Personal Life

### Early Marriage and Family Dynamics

Fatmawati's marriage to Sukarno began in 1943 when she was just 20 years old and he was 42.[^58] Their early years together coincided with the final period of Japanese occupation and the struggle for independence, creating a bond forged in shared nationalist commitment. She gave birth to their first child, Guntur, in 1944 while pregnant with him as she sewed the Indonesian flag.[^59]

Living in the presidential residence at Istana Merdeka in Jakarta, Fatmawati raised her five children during Indonesia's most turbulent early years.[^60] Her daughter Megawati later recalled growing up in the palace during her childhood and youth, experiencing both the privileges and pressures of being the president's family.[^61]

### Personality and Character

Historical accounts describe Fatmawati as politically aware and deeply involved in women's issues, going beyond her ceremonial role as First Lady.[^62] Her involvement with Aisyiyah, the women's wing of Muhammadiyah (which she helped establish alongside Siti Walidah), demonstrated her commitment to women's empowerment and Islamic social reform.[^63] She was active in organizations from elementary school, indicating a lifelong commitment to community engagement.[^64]

Those who knew her described her dedication during the revolutionary period, when she accompanied Sukarno to the jungle and managed all his needs under primitive conditions.[^65] Her emotional connection to Indonesia's independence was evident; she recalled shedding tears of joy mixed with emotion during the proclamation ceremony, noting that many men also cried, including herself and Mr. Suwirjo.[^66]

However, Fatmawati's opposition to polygamy revealed her personal limits and principles. Unlike some other political wives of her era, she refused to quietly accept her husband's additional marriages, choosing instead to maintain her dignity through separation while retaining her official title.[^67] This decision reflected both her Islamic values and her sense of personal worth, even at significant political cost.

### Later Years in Separation

After leaving the presidential palace in 1953, Fatmawati lived separately in her Sriwijaya Street residence in Jakarta for the remaining 27 years of her life.[^68] She continued to hold the title of First Lady until Sukarno's presidency ended in 1967.[^69] During these years, she focused on raising her children and her social welfare work, including the Ibu Soekarno Foundation.[^70]

Her daughter Rachmawati, who was closest to her parents among all the siblings, later wrote about the complex family dynamics in her 1984 memoir.[^71] Despite the separation from Sukarno, Fatmawati maintained her connection to Indonesian public life and remained respected as the woman who had sewn the national flag and served as First Lady during the revolutionary period.

### Death

On May 14, 1980, at age 57, Fatmawati died of a heart attack in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, while returning to Jakarta from performing umrah (lesser pilgrimage) in Mecca.[^72] The timing – returning from a religious pilgrimage – reflected her lifelong commitment to Islamic faith. She was buried in Karet Bivak Cemetery in Central Jakarta, where her grave remains a site of historical significance.[^73]

## Legacy

### National Recognition and Commemoration

Twenty years after her death, on November 4, 2000, President Abdurrahman Wahid conferred upon Fatmawati the title of National Hero of Indonesia (Pahlawan Nasional) through Presidential Decree No. 118/TK/2000.[^74] This honor recognized her contributions to Indonesian independence and her symbolic role in creating the national flag.

Her legacy has been commemorated throughout Indonesia in various ways:

- **Fatmawati Soekarno Airport** in Bengkulu was named in her honor, with the name officially inaugurated by her daughter, President Megawati Sukarnoputri, on November 30, 2004.[^75]
- **Fatmawati Central General Hospital** in South Jakarta, which she established in 1954 as a hospital specializing in childhood tuberculosis and rehabilitation, continues to serve the public.[^76]
- **Fatmawati's childhood home** in Bengkulu has been preserved as a tourist attraction on Jalan Fatmawati (Fatmawati Street), featuring an exhibition room with photographs and memorabilia.[^77]
- **A statue of Fatmawati** created by renowned sculptor I Nyoman Nuarta was inaugurated by President Joko Widodo on February 5, 2020, at Simpang Lima Ratu Samban in Bengkulu to commemorate her birthday.[^78]

### Symbol of Indonesian Nationalism

The Bendera Pusaka that Fatmawati sewed remains one of Indonesia's most sacred national relics. Though it can no longer be flown due to its fragile condition, the flag is preserved with extraordinary care at the Presidential Palace, maintained in climate-controlled conditions with military guard.[^79] Plans to relocate it to the National Monument in a 24-karat gold-plated case have been postponed indefinitely due to security and funding concerns.[^80]

Every August 17th, when Indonesians celebrate independence day and a replica flag is raised, Fatmawati's contribution is remembered in speeches and commemorations nationwide. Her act of sewing the flag has become part of Indonesian national mythology – a simple yet profound gesture that connected domestic labor traditionally associated with women to the founding of the nation.[^81]

### Impact on Women's Political Participation

Fatmawati's legacy extends through her daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri, who became Indonesia's first and only female president (2001-2004), creating a unique mother-daughter political dynasty.[^82] This connection demonstrates how Fatmawati's position as First Lady, despite the personal challenges she faced, helped establish a foundation for women's political participation at the highest levels of Indonesian government.

However, her legacy regarding women's rights remains complex. While her opposition to polygamy inspired women's organizations in the 1950s, her decision to leave the palace rather than publicly campaign for legal reform disappointed some activists who hoped she would use her position more forcefully.[^83] Nevertheless, her personal stand against polygamy, at great personal cost, demonstrated the courage of her convictions and highlighted the need for legal protections that would eventually be enacted in 1974.[^84]

### Aisyiyah and Women's Empowerment

Through her involvement with Aisyiyah, the women's wing of Muhammadiyah (now one of Indonesia's largest women's Islamic organizations with fifteen million members), Fatmawati contributed to a legacy of Islamic women's activism.[^85] Aisyiyah's work in education, healthcare, and women's economic empowerment continues to benefit Indonesian women today, particularly in rural areas.[^86] The organization's early achievements – including Indonesia's first Islamic preschool (1919), teacher college (1922), and women-led mosque worship (1923) – reflect the progressive Islamic reform movement that shaped Fatmawati's worldview.[^87]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians have increasingly recognized Fatmawati's contributions beyond the symbolic act of sewing the flag. Research into her political biography employs feminist sociological approaches and historical methodology to understand her role in Indonesian independence and nation-building.[^88] Historians note that though she was only 22 years old when Indonesia became independent, she successfully fulfilled the demanding role of First Lady during the nation's most turbulent period.[^89]

Academic assessments emphasize that Fatmawati's contribution, while symbolic, "carried immense patriotic significance and became an enduring symbol of the nation's identity."[^90] Her presence at the proclamation ceremony and her role in providing the flag represent women's participation in independence, even if that participation was often relegated to supportive rather than leadership roles.

Fatmawati is credited with carrying out state duties with dignity, entertaining foreign dignitaries, and representing the new nation during critical early years.[^91] Her establishment of the Ibu Soekarno Foundation demonstrated genuine concern for child welfare and healthcare that extended beyond ceremonial duties.[^92] Supporters view her as a devoted wife who supported Sukarno through the revolutionary period, managing household and family under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, including periods in the jungle during Dutch military aggression.[^93]

Her posthumous recognition as a National Hero in 2000 reflects official acknowledgment of her contributions. The Indonesian government and many citizens view her as one of the important figures in the proclamation of Indonesian independence, someone whose quiet but essential work enabled the dramatic moment when Sukarno declared independence.[^94]

Contemporary Indonesian women's activists in Aisyiyah and other Islamic women's organizations claim Fatmawati as an important historical figure who demonstrated how Islamic faith and women's activism could be combined.[^95] Her legacy inspires ongoing efforts for women's empowerment within Islamic frameworks.

### Negative Views and Criticisms

Some critics argue that Fatmawati's contributions have been romanticized beyond their actual significance. They point out that sewing a flag, while symbolically important, does not constitute the same level of contribution as those who engaged in armed struggle, diplomatic negotiation, or political organizing for independence.[^96] From this perspective, her recognition as a National Hero reflects her marriage to Sukarno more than her individual achievements.

Feminist historians have expressed disappointment with Fatmawati's response to Sukarno's polygamy, viewing her withdrawal from the palace as a missed opportunity for advocacy. Women's organizations at the time had hoped she would use her position as First Lady to publicly champion marriage law reform and women's rights.[^97] Instead, her personal solution – maintaining her title while living separately – addressed her individual situation but did little to advance legal protections for other Indonesian women who faced similar circumstances without her privileges.

Critics note that Fatmawati was "not initially in favor of reforming marriage laws until she found out about her husband's intentions to marry again," suggesting her concern for women's rights was prompted by personal grievance rather than principled commitment.[^98] This interpretation portrays her as someone who only recognized injustice when she personally experienced it, rather than as a true advocate for systemic change.

Some historians argue that Fatmawati's role exemplifies how Indonesian nationalism incorporated women primarily in supportive, domestic capacities rather than as equal participants. The fact that her most celebrated contribution involved sewing – traditional women's work – rather than political or military action reflects gendered limitations on women's participation in the independence movement.[^99]

Her absence from Sukarno's funeral, while understandable on personal grounds, is viewed by some as petty and beneath the dignity expected of a National Hero, especially one whose status derived largely from her relationship with the deceased.[^100] Critics suggest that a truly statesmanlike figure would have attended to represent national unity and show respect for Indonesia's founding president, regardless of personal grievances.

Finally, some observers question whether Fatmawati's numerous commemorations – airports, hospitals, streets, statues – are proportionate to her actual contributions, or whether they reflect Indonesia's tendency toward cult-of-personality politics and dynastic thinking, especially given that her daughter later became president.[^101]
