## Summary

William Coley is considered the father of cancer immunotherapy. He developed 'Coley's toxins' — a mixture of killed bacteria — to treat cancer by stimulating the immune system. Though dismissed for decades, his pioneering approach to harnessing the immune system against cancer has been vindicated by modern immunotherapy breakthroughs.
