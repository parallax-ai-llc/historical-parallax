## Overview

Mata Hari (born Margaretha Zelle) is the archetype of the "femme fatale" spy. A Dutch exotic dancer and courtesan who captivated Paris during the Belle Époque, she was accused by the French government during World War I of being a German double agent responsible for the deaths of 50,000 soldiers. She was executed by firing squad in 1917. Modern historians argue she was likely a convenient scapegoat—an incompetent amateur spy at worst, or wholly innocent of significant espionage, sacrificed to boost French morale during a disastrous year of the war.

## Espionage

### German Offer (1915)

In Cologne, German consul supposedly offered her 20,000 francs to spy. Code name **H-21**.
She took money (claimed later it was "payment for seized furs").

### French Offer (1916)

French Captain Ladoux recruited her to spy on Germans in Belgium. She agreed (wanted 1 million francs).

### The Trap

**Intercept:**
French intercepted German radio message from Madrid to Berlin describing activities of agent H-21. Details matched Mata Hari perfectly.
**Theory:** Germans *knew* French would break code and intentionally burned her (she was useless to them).

## Arrest and Trial

**Arrest:** February 1917, Paris. Plaza Athénée hotel.

**Trial:**
Secret military tribunal.
Prosecution blamed her for leaks causing huge casualties (no evidence).
She admitted taking German money but claimed she never gave info—only wanted to spy *for* France.

> "A harlot? Yes. But a traitoress, never!"

**Verdict:** Guilty. Death.

## Execution (October 15, 1917)

**Vincennes:**
Refused blindfold. Blew a kiss to the firing squad.
12 soldiers fired.

---

## Legend vs. Reality

**Myth:**
Master spy who seduced secrets from generals.

**Reality:**
Aging courtesan needing money. Gossip, not secrets. French needed someone to blame for mutinies and losses in 1917.
