Stephen Hawking was one of the most renowned theoretical physicists of the modern era. His name appeared in Epstein-related documents in a context that suggests attempts to deny false rumors, not evidence of wrongdoing.

## Context of Mention

Hawking's name appeared in an email from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell instructing her to offer a reward to anyone who could disprove allegations that Hawking had participated in an "underage orgy." This email suggests:

- Epstein was attempting to deny damaging rumors
- The context was defensive, not incriminating
- No evidence supports the rumor mentioned

## Scientific Conference

Hawking attended a scientific conference in 2006 that Epstein helped fund. The conference was legitimate and attended by numerous scientists. There is no evidence of inappropriate conduct during or related to this event.

## No Allegations

There are no credible allegations or evidence of any misconduct by Stephen Hawking related to Epstein or anyone else.
