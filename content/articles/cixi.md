## Summary

Empress Dowager Cixi (1835–1908) was a Manchu noblewoman who exercised de facto control over the Chinese government for nearly half a century during the late Qing dynasty.[^1] Rising from the position of imperial concubine to become one of the most powerful women in Chinese history, she ruled as regent and empress dowager through three successive emperors from 1861 until her death in 1908.[^2] Her reign witnessed China's tumultuous transition from medieval empire to modern nation-state, marked by both significant modernization efforts and catastrophic setbacks including military defeats and popular uprisings.[^3] Cixi's legacy remains deeply contested, with scholars debating whether she was a capable reformer who modernized China or a reactionary despot whose policies accelerated the Qing dynasty's collapse.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Cixi was born on November 29, 1835, during the tenth day of the tenth lunar month in the fifteenth year of the Daoguang Emperor's reign.[^5] She belonged to the Manchu Yehe Nara clan, part of the Bordered Blue Banner of the Eight Banners military-administrative system that formed the backbone of Qing rule.[^6] Her father, Huizheng, was a minor Manchu official who held the title of third-class duke and served as Commissioner of Anhui Province, though his position was relatively modest within the imperial hierarchy.[^7]

Born during a period when the Qing Empire still appeared formidable, Cixi grew up in Beijing in a household that, while not wealthy, possessed the prestigious bloodline of the ruling Manchu race.[^8] Her father's principal wife belonged to the Manchu Fucha clan, and Cixi (whose birth name was Lan Kuei or Yehonala) was the eldest of four children, with two brothers and a sister.[^9] Few concrete records document her early childhood, but her Manchu heritage meant her feet were not bound, unlike Han Chinese girls of her generation—a detail that would later carry symbolic significance during her reign when she banned foot-binding entirely.[^10]

The selection process that would change her life forever began in 1851, when she participated in one of the periodic nationwide selections for imperial consorts alongside sixty other candidates.[^11] These candidates had to be Manchu or Mongol—Han Chinese were excluded—and their families were required to be above a certain rank, having been obliged by law to register their daughters when they reached puberty.[^12] In spring 1852, the sixteen-year-old girl caught the eye of the Xianfeng Emperor during the inspection held at the Forbidden City.[^13] On June 26, 1852, Lady Yehe Nara formally entered the Forbidden City, leaving her widowed mother's residence at Xilahutong, and was placed in the sixth rank of consorts with the style "Noble Lady Lan."[^14] Among the other chosen candidates were Noble Lady Li and Concubine Zhen of the Niohuru clan, who would become Empress Dowager Ci'an and serve as Cixi's co-regent for two decades.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Cixi's ascent from low-ranking concubine to the pinnacle of imperial power was anything but inevitable. Her fortunes changed dramatically in 1856 when she gave birth to a son, Zaichun, who would become the Tongzhi Emperor.[^16] This made her the mother of the Xianfeng Emperor's only surviving male heir, elevating her status within the imperial harem and ensuring her political relevance. When the Xianfeng Emperor died on August 22, 1861, at the Chengde Mountain Resort in Rehe Province following the humiliating defeat in the Second Opium War, he left behind a five-year-old heir and a succession crisis.[^17]

Before his death, Xianfeng had summoned eight of his most prestigious ministers—headed by Sushun, Zaiyuan, and Duanhua—and named them the "Eight Regent Ministers" to direct and support the child emperor.[^18] These regents, led by the conservative Sushun, did not appreciate Cixi's interference in political affairs, and their frequent confrontations with the two empresses dowager—Cixi and the senior Empress Dowager Ci'an—created mounting tensions.[^19] Recognizing that her position and her son's throne were threatened, Cixi began secretly gathering support from talented ministers, soldiers, and others who had been ostracized by the eight regents for personal or political reasons.[^20]

Her most crucial alliance was with Prince Gong, one of the Xianfeng Emperor's brothers who harbored great ambitions but had been excluded from power by the regents.[^21] Cixi orchestrated a masterful coup, later known as the Xinyou Coup of 1861, named after that year in the Chinese sexagenary cycle.[^22] She and the young emperor returned to Beijing before the rest of the funeral procession, accompanied by only two of the eight regents, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, while Sushun remained behind with the deceased emperor's body.[^23] This strategic separation allowed Cixi more time to consolidate support with Prince Gong in the capital, ensuring the power base of the regents was divided.[^24]

In November 1861, following the successful coup, Cixi moved swiftly and ruthlessly against her enemies. Prince Gong had suggested that the three leading regents be executed by slow slicing, the most painful method of execution, but Cixi ordered that Sushun be beheaded while Zaiyuan and Duanhua were given white silk to hang themselves—a more honorable death befitting their rank.[^25] She quickly rewarded Prince Gong by appointing him prince regent, and his eldest daughter was made a first-rank princess, a title usually bestowed only on the empress's first-born daughter.[^26] Thus, at age twenty-six, Cixi had outmaneuvered the established power structure and assumed the regency alongside Ci'an, beginning nearly five decades of dominance over Chinese politics.[^27]

## Major Achievements

### The Tongzhi Restoration and Self-Strengthening Movement

During her first regency from 1861 to 1873, Cixi supervised the Tongzhi Restoration, a series of moderate reforms that helped the faltering Qing regime survive until 1911.[^28] Although she refused to adopt Western models of government, fearing they would undermine Manchu supremacy and traditional Confucian values, she pragmatically supported technological and military reforms through the Self-Strengthening Movement.[^29] Under this program, schools were created for the study of foreign languages, a modern customs service was instituted, Western-style arsenals were constructed, and China's first foreign service office was established.[^30]

The conservative faction of the imperial court was led by Cixi, yet even she was not entirely opposed to economic reform, though she remained wary of its social and political consequences.[^31] In the 1870s and 1880s, provincial officials used their positions to build shipping lines, telegraph networks, and railways—profit-oriented industries that represented entirely new ventures for the Chinese government.[^32] The modernization projects included agricultural reform, naval procurement and training, the creation of schools and military colleges with new curricula, and the establishment of railroads, telegraph routes, steamship services, modern mining operations, and textile factories.[^33]

### The New Policies Reforms (1902-1908)

The catastrophic failure of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 marked a turning point in Cixi's approach to governance. After openly blaming herself for causing the empire to face insufferable consequences—including over $330 million in reparations debt and a two-year prohibition on arms imports under the humiliating Boxer Protocol—Cixi embarked on an ambitious decade-long campaign to rebuild China's reputation and implement comprehensive reforms.[^34] In January 1902, she announced a sweeping series of reforms officially designated as the New Policies (Xinzheng), which touched virtually every aspect of Chinese life.[^35]

These late-Qing reforms were remarkably progressive for their time. Cixi legalized marriages between Han Chinese and Manchu partners, ending centuries of ethnic separation policies.[^36] She banned foot-binding, a custom long practiced on Han girls that had crippled generations of women physically and symbolically.[^37] In 1905, she made the revolutionary decision to abolish the Imperial Examination system, which had been the cornerstone for selecting Confucian scholars as government officials for over a millennium.[^38] Traditional academies were transformed into Western-style schools, various textbooks were published throughout the country, and a modern education system began to take shape.[^39]

Perhaps most remarkably, in 1906 Cixi announced that China would be transformed into a constitutional monarchy with plans to hold elections.[^40] On September 24, 1905, she assigned five ministers to travel abroad and investigate various political formats, including the United States where they met with President Theodore Roosevelt.[^41] In response to mounting internal pressures and the perceived success of Japan's Meiji constitutional model, the Qing court issued an imperial edict on September 1, 1906, pledging to prepare for constitutional government over a nine-year period, with a constitution to be enacted by 1917.[^42] The reforms also simplified central bureaucracy, modernized taxation policies, and created new military and police organizations.[^43]

### Infrastructure and Technological Modernization

Throughout her reign, Cixi oversaw various modernization efforts that brought medieval China into closer contact with the industrial world. She supported the construction of railways, telegraph lines, and the modernization of the navy, though her commitment to military modernization was frequently questioned.[^44] These infrastructure projects, while sometimes controversial and incomplete, represented China's first serious attempts to match Western technological capabilities and laid the groundwork for future development.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Suppression of the Hundred Days' Reform

Cixi's most controversial political act came in 1898 when she brutally suppressed the Hundred Days' Reform, an ambitious modernization program that many historians believe represented China's last chance for peaceful transformation. The reform was initiated by the Guangxu Emperor and led by progressive scholars including Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, who persuaded the young emperor to enact a series of sweeping changes over approximately one hundred days.[^46] The reforms aimed to transform China's government, education system, and military along Western and Japanese lines, threatening the power of conservative elites and the Manchu establishment.[^47]

On September 21, 1898, conservative forces rallied behind Cixi, who staged a coup d'état with military support, forcing the Guangxu Emperor into house arrest where he would remain for the rest of his life.[^48] The Hundred Days' Reform ended with the rescinding of the new edicts and the execution of six of the reform's chief advocates, known as the "Six Gentlemen": Tan Sitong, Kang Guangren (Kang Youwei's brother), Lin Xu, Yang Shenxiu, Yang Rui, and Liu Guangdi.[^49] The six reformers stood trial on September 28, 1898, and were beheaded at Caishikou in Beijing the same day without being tried by the Ministry of Justice.[^50] While Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao managed to escape to Japan, the purge sent a chilling message about the limits of reform.[^51]

Many historians believe that by reversing these planned reforms, Cixi's conservatism effectively eliminated China's last opportunity to effect peaceful change, thereby hastening the dynasty's eventual downfall in 1911.[^52] Some scholars argue she saw the reforms as a threat to her own power and the Manchu position, prioritizing political survival over national progress.[^53]

### The Boxer Rebellion Disaster

Perhaps Cixi's greatest catastrophe was her decision to support the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The Boxers were a xenophobic militia movement that blamed foreign influence for China's troubles and possessed quasi-magical beliefs about their invulnerability to bullets.[^54] Seeing the Boxer movement as a potential solution to expelling foreigners from China, Cixi secretly supported them and eventually declared war on the foreign powers in 1900, calling on all Qing officials to back the Boxers.[^55] This decision proved disastrous when the combined forces of eight foreign nations decisively defeated the Boxers and occupied Beijing, forcing Cixi to flee the capital in humiliating circumstances.[^56]

The Boxer Protocol signed in September 1901 imposed harsh, punitive terms that further crippled China. The empire was forced to pay over $330 million in reparations debt, accept a two-year prohibition on arms imports, allow foreign troops to be stationed in Beijing, and execute or punish officials who had supported the Boxers.[^57] This humiliation represented one of the lowest points in modern Chinese history and severely weakened the Qing dynasty's legitimacy and financial resources.[^58]

### The Summer Palace Embezzlement Allegations

One of the most persistent criticisms leveled against Cixi concerns allegations that she embezzled naval funds to rebuild the Summer Palace. Many believed that Cixi diverted money earmarked for the Beiyang Fleet to construct her lavish palace, thereby weakening China's navy before its devastating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.[^59] The amounts claimed vary considerably across sources—ranging from 5-6 million taels to as much as 30 million taels of silver.[^60] The Marble Boat at the Summer Palace is often cited as an ironic symbol of this alleged misappropriation, representing a frivolous decorative boat built while the real navy deteriorated.[^61]

However, recent historical research has contested this narrative. Jung Chang's biography notes that the embezzled funds amounted to 3-8 million silver taels, most coming from civil administration rather than military budgets.[^62] Some Chinese historians argue that a maximum of six million taels were allocated to the Summer Palace, none from the Navy's capital budget but only from accrued bank interest.[^63] Nevertheless, the perception of Cixi prioritizing personal luxury over national defense contributed significantly to her negative reputation.[^64]

### Succession Manipulations and the Death of Guangxu

Cixi's manipulation of imperial succession raised serious questions about her commitment to legitimate governance. When her son, the Tongzhi Emperor, died in 1875 at age nineteen without a male heir, she arranged for her three-year-old nephew Zaitian to become the Guangxu Emperor, adopting him symbolically to make him eligible to succeed.[^65] This violated traditional succession principles since the new emperor came from the same generation rather than the next, allowing Cixi to continue as regent.[^66]

Most troubling was the mysterious death of the Guangxu Emperor on November 14, 1908—just one day before Cixi's own death. Forensic tests conducted on the emperor's remains revealed arsenic levels 2,000 times higher than normal, and scientists concluded the poison could only have been administered in a high dose at one time.[^67] While direct evidence linking Cixi to the murder is circumstantial, the timing strongly suggests she ordered his assassination to prevent him from reversing her policies after her death.[^68] Before dying, she installed the two-year-old Puyi as the new emperor, ensuring her political arrangements would outlast her.[^69]

## Personal Life

### Family Relationships and Imperial Household

Cixi's personal relationships were profoundly shaped by the rigid protocols and political machinations of the Qing court. As mother of the Tongzhi Emperor, she maintained a complex and sometimes troubled relationship with her son. When Zaitian (the Guangxu Emperor) was chosen to succeed after Tongzhi's death, Cixi adopted the four-year-old boy as her son to legitimize her continued regency.[^70] In an unusual household arrangement designed to reinforce her authority, the Guangxu Emperor was forced to address Cixi as "Dear Father" rather than mother, enforcing an image that she was the paternal authority figure.[^71] Zaitian was taken from his birth family and completely cut off from them for the remainder of his life.[^72]

Her relationship with the Guangxu Emperor deteriorated into one of mutual suspicion and hostility, particularly after she crushed his Hundred Days' Reform in 1898. When reformers including Kang Youwei involved the emperor in a plot to assassinate Cixi, their plans were discovered, leading to Guangxu's permanent house arrest.[^73] The tensions between aunt and nephew-son reflected broader conflicts between reformist and conservative factions that plagued late Qing politics.[^74]

### Palace Life and Court Culture

Life inside the Forbidden City revolved around elaborate rituals and a hierarchy maintained by thousands of eunuchs and female servants. With the exception of the Emperor, the 6,000 residents of the Forbidden City were eunuchs or women.[^75] At the beginning of the twentieth century, approximately 2,000 eunuchs worked in the palace, wielding considerable power and notorious for corruption and theft.[^76] Much of the day-to-day operation of the imperial court was managed by Li Lianying (also called Li Liyang), Cixi's favorite eunuch who enjoyed unprecedented access and influence.[^77]

Cixi initially lived in the Palace of Eternal Spring (Changchungong) and later moved to the Palace of Eternal Longevity (Yongshougong), also residing at various times in the Palace for Gathered Elegance.[^78] Her daily routine demonstrated remarkable discipline and dedication: she began work before sunrise at 5 AM, clearing mountains of paperwork and attending meetings throughout the day, barely making time for meals and working even during illness.[^79] She famously continued working until the final hours before her death.[^80]

### Personal Interests and Temperament

Beyond politics, Cixi possessed diverse cultural interests and a complex personality. She loved Chinese opera and watched performances almost daily, was known as a good singer herself, and enjoyed bird-gazing in her beautiful gardens.[^81] She penned many original compositions that were performed and staged by her eunuchs.[^82] Contemporaries described her as possessing unusual charm, graceful movements, and "an unusually attractive personality" despite her ruthless political nature.[^83]

Cixi was deeply superstitious, believing in omens and astrological signs. When her daughter-in-law Arute's zodiac symbol of tiger was perceived as threatening to Cixi, whose own symbol was a goat, the superstitious empress dowager interpreted it as a divine warning that she would fall prey to Arute.[^84] She was also known to be either a great friend or terrible enemy, showing extreme loyalty to allies but ruthless vengeance toward opponents.[^85] Among her victims was the Pearl Concubine, Emperor Guangxu's favorite, whom Cixi ordered thrown down a well by her eunuchs.[^86]

## Legacy

Empress Dowager Cixi died in the Hall of Graceful Bird at the Middle Sea of Zhongnanhai, Beijing, on November 15, 1908, only one day after the Guangxu Emperor's death.[^87] Her nearly half-century of rule had witnessed China's transformation from a medieval empire to a nation struggling to find its place in the modern world. The republic that would replace the Qing dynasty just three years after her death inherited both the modernization foundations she had laid and the deep structural problems her conservative instincts had failed to address.[^88]

Cixi's most tangible legacy lies in the institutional reforms she implemented during her final decade. The abolition of the Imperial Examination system in 1905 fundamentally restructured how China selected its governing elite, opening pathways for modern education and Western learning.[^89] The New Policies reforms, including the creation of modern schools, the legalization of interethnic marriage, the prohibition of foot-binding, and the promise of constitutional government, represented unprecedented breaks with tradition that continued to influence Chinese society long after the dynasty's collapse.[^90] The infrastructure projects initiated during her reign—railways, telegraph lines, modern arsenals—provided the physical foundation for China's further development.[^91]

However, her legacy is equally defined by what she prevented and delayed. By suppressing the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898, she eliminated what many historians consider China's best opportunity for peaceful, gradual modernization that might have preserved the dynasty while transforming it.[^92] Her disastrous support for the Boxer Rebellion severely damaged China's international standing, drained its finances, and emboldened revolutionary movements.[^93] The restrictions she placed on the Guangxu Emperor's authority prevented a younger, more reform-minded ruler from addressing China's mounting crises.[^94]

Cixi's rule demonstrated the fundamental contradictions of late Qing reform efforts: she recognized the necessity of modernization to preserve the dynasty yet feared that genuine reform would undermine the Manchu power structure and her own authority. This tension between pragmatic adaptation and conservative resistance characterized her entire reign. While she eventually embraced many reforms she had previously opposed, particularly after the Boxer catastrophe, critics argue these changes came too late and were too limited to save the dynasty.[^95] The republic that emerged in 1911, however, proved equally unable to solve China's problems, suggesting that the challenges Cixi faced transcended any individual ruler's capabilities.[^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

A growing revisionist school of historians has worked to rehabilitate Cixi's reputation from the overwhelmingly negative portrait that dominated earlier scholarship. Jung Chang's 2013 biography, "Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China," presents a sympathetic portrait arguing that Cixi "brought medieval China into the modern age" through her reforms and modernization efforts.[^97] Chang's extensive use of Chinese-language sources—including court records, official and private correspondence, diaries, and eyewitness accounts—has revealed aspects of Cixi's rule that English-language historians had missed or misunderstood.[^98]

These revisionists argue that Cixi has been unfairly scapegoated for deep-rooted problems beyond any single person's ability to solve, comparing her to Marie Antoinette in France and Alexandra in Russia as female rulers blamed for systemic failures.[^99] They point out that she ruled China for nearly five decades during the empire's most turbulent period, facing unprecedented challenges from Western imperialism, internal rebellions, and rapid technological change.[^100] Her supporters credit her with political acumen, noting her ability to navigate complex court politics, build coalitions, and maintain power in a male-dominated system demonstrated exceptional skill.[^101]

Scholars who view Cixi more favorably emphasize her modernization achievements, particularly the New Policies reforms of 1902-1908 that fundamentally transformed Chinese society. They argue that her willingness to abandon the examination system, permit constitutional reforms, and embrace technological modernization—even if reluctantly—showed pragmatic flexibility rather than reactionary obstinacy.[^102] Some historians suggest that her earlier conservatism was a necessary strategy to maintain stability and Manchu rule during periods of crisis, and that she implemented reforms when circumstances permitted.[^103] China expert Orville Schell praised Chang's biography despite finding it sometimes bordering on hagiography, acknowledging the value of presenting a more balanced perspective.[^104]

### Negative Views

Traditional interpretations of Cixi remain overwhelmingly critical, portraying her as a ruthless, manipulative despot whose reactionary policies contributed significantly to the Qing dynasty's humiliation and eventual collapse in 1911.[^105] This negative assessment, often symbolized by the nickname "Dragon Lady," emphasizes her cunning, spiteful nature and her arch-conservative resistance to meaningful reform.[^106] Critics argue that while she eventually implemented modernization measures, these changes came only after catastrophic failures forced her hand, and even then remained superficial attempts to preserve Manchu power rather than genuine transformation.[^107]

The sources of Cixi's negative reputation are revealing. The most damaging work was written in 1910 by Sir Edmund Backhouse and John Otway Percy Bland, two authors known for their anti-dynastic sentiments.[^108] However, Backhouse was later exposed as having forged much of the source material used in this influential work, raising questions about the reliability of many salacious stories about Cixi.[^109] Nevertheless, these fabrications shaped Western perceptions for generations. Chinese reformer Kang Youwei, whose Hundred Days' Reform Cixi crushed in 1898, also portrayed her extremely negatively in his writings, though his personal animosity obviously colored his assessment.[^110]

Serious historians maintain substantial criticisms independent of these questionable sources. They point to her suppression of the 1898 reforms as eliminating China's last chance for peaceful transformation, her catastrophic support for the Boxer Rebellion as demonstrating poor judgment and xenophobic tendencies, and her manipulation of succession as prioritizing personal power over dynastic legitimacy.[^111] The alleged embezzlement of naval funds for the Summer Palace, whether fully accurate or not, symbolizes critics' view of her as placing personal luxury above national defense.[^112] Most damningly, the arsenic poisoning of the Guangxu Emperor just before her own death suggests she was willing to commit murder to prevent reforms she opposed.[^113]

Historians skeptical of revisionist rehabilitation argue that Cixi's reforms were too little, too late, implemented only under duress, and designed primarily to preserve the autocratic system rather than genuinely modernize China. They note that Japan, facing similar challenges during the same period, successfully transformed itself through the Meiji Restoration while China under Cixi failed—suggesting that leadership quality mattered significantly.[^114] While acknowledging that Cixi faced extraordinary challenges, critics maintain that her conservative instincts, political paranoia, and prioritization of Manchu supremacy over national strength made her a net negative force in Chinese history.[^115]
