## Summary

Milarepa is Tibet's most beloved saint, a poet-yogi whose journey from murderer to enlightened master exemplifies the Buddhist path of transformation. After killing 35 people through black magic, he endured years of harsh training under Marpa the Translator. He then meditated for years in remote mountain caves, achieving full enlightenment in one lifetime. His songs of spiritual realization, the Mila Gurbum, are treasured masterpieces of Tibetan literature.
