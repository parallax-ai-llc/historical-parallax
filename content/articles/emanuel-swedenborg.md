## Summary

Emanuel Swedenborg was a Swedish scientist, philosopher, and Christian mystic who claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world. Originally a scientist and inventor, he underwent a spiritual crisis at age 56 and spent the rest of his life writing theological works based on his claimed spiritual experiences. His voluminous writings, including Heaven and Hell, describe the afterlife in elaborate detail. His followers founded the New Church (Swedenborgian Church) after his death.
