## Summary

Martin Chalfie demonstrated that green fluorescent protein (GFP) could be used as a biological marker in living organisms, showing that GFP could glow in organisms other than jellyfish. His work with GFP in the transparent roundworm C. elegans proved it could be a universal biological tagging tool. He shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
