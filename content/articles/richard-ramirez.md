## Summary
Richard Ramirez, the 'Night Stalker,' terrorized Southern California from June 1984 to August 1985. He was convicted of 13 murders, 5 attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults, and 14 burglaries. His crimes were notable for their randomness, targeting victims regardless of age, sex, or race during nocturnal home invasions.

## Early Life
Born on February 29, 1960, in El Paso, Texas, to Mexican immigrant parents, Ramirez suffered childhood head injuries and was influenced by his cousin Miguel, a Vietnam veteran who showed him war atrocity photos and murdered his wife in front of the young Richard. He dropped out of school and moved to Los Angeles. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Ramirez committed home invasions across Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco, breaking in at night to shoot, stab, or bludgeon residents. His victims ranged from age 6 to 83. He forced victims to 'swear to Satan' and left satanic symbols at crime scenes. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
A fingerprint from a stolen car identified Ramirez. When his mugshot was published, citizens in East Los Angeles recognized and chased him down. He was convicted of 13 murders in 1989 and sentenced to death. He died of lymphoma on death row on June 7, 2013. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
