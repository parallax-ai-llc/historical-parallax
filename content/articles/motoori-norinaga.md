## Summary

Motoori Norinaga was a Japanese scholar of kokugaku (National Learning) who was the most important figure in the Shinto revival movement. His 44-volume commentary on the Kojiki (Japan's oldest chronicle) reestablished the ancient Shinto texts as the foundation of Japanese cultural identity. He argued for the superiority of Japanese sensibility (mono no aware, 'the pathos of things') over Chinese moral philosophy. His work laid the intellectual foundation for State Shinto.
