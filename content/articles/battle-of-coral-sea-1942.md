## Overview

The Battle of the Coral Sea was the first naval battle in history where the opposing ships never sighted each other; all fighting was done by carrier-based aircraft. It was a check on Japanese expansion toward Australia (Port Moresby). While the US lost the carrier *Lexington* (tactical loss), they damaged the Japanese carriers *Shōkaku* and *Zuikaku* enough that they missed the Battle of Midway a month later. This absence likely cost Japan the war.
