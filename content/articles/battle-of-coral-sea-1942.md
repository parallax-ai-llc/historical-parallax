## Overview

The Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942) was a historic naval engagement. It was the **first battle in history where the opposing ships never saw each other** or fired a gun at one another. All fighting was conducted by carrier-based aircraft. Imperial Japan attempted to capture Port Moresby (Papua New Guinea) to threaten Australia. The US Navy, having broken the Japanese code, intercepted them.

## Tactical Loss, Strategic Victory

**The Losses:**
- **USA:** Lost the fleet carrier *USS Lexington* ("Lady Lex") and the destroyer *Sims*. The *USS Yorktown* was heavily damaged.
- **Japan:** Lost the light carrier *Shoho*. The fleet carrier *Shokaku* was severely damaged, and *Zuikaku* lost most of its air group.

Technically, Japan won (sinking a heavy carrier vs a light one).
But Strategically, the US won:
1.  The invasion of Port Moresby was turned back (saving Australia).
2.  The damaged *Shokaku* and de-planed *Zuikaku* could not participate in the upcoming **Battle of Midway**. If those two carriers had been at Midway, the US likely would have lost the war in the Pacific.

## The Codebreakers

Commander **Joseph Rochefort** and his team at Station HYPO (Hawaii) had cracked JN-25b (Japanese naval code).
They warned Admiral Nimitz that the Japanese were heading to the Coral Sea, allowing the US to ambush them.
This validated the importance of SIGINT (Signals Intelligence).

## The Miracle of the Yorktown

The *USS Yorktown* limped back to Pearl Harbor with bomb damage, leaking fuel.
Experts said it would take 3 months to repair.
Admiral Nimitz gave them **3 days**.
Workers labored 24/7 in a frantic haze of welding sparks and heat. The *Yorktown* sailed out to fight at Midway just 72 hours later, playing a crucial role in the victory.
