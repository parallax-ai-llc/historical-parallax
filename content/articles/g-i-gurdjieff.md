## Summary

George Ivanovich Gurdjieff was an Armenian-Greek mystic, philosopher, and teacher who founded the Fourth Way tradition of spiritual development. He taught that most humans live in a state of 'waking sleep' and need special practices to develop higher consciousness. He established the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man near Paris. His ideas, presented through his writings, sacred dances (movements), and music, influenced many subsequent spiritual movements.
