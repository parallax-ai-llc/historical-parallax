## Summary

Daniel Defoe (c. 1660–1731) was an English writer, journalist, merchant, and spy who is widely regarded as one of the founders of the English novel.[^1] Best known for his landmark work *Robinson Crusoe* (1719), often considered one of the first modern novels, Defoe was a remarkably prolific author who produced more than three hundred works across diverse genres.[^2] Beyond his literary achievements, he led a tumultuous life marked by bankruptcy, imprisonment, political intrigue, and espionage work for the British government.[^3] His life experiences—including financial ruin, religious persecution as a Presbyterian Dissenter, and clandestine intelligence operations—profoundly influenced his fiction and journalism.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Daniel Defoe was born Daniel Foe around September 1660 in the parish of St. Giles Cripplegate, London, to James Foe, a prosperous tallow chandler and member of the Worshipful Company of Butchers, and his wife Alice.[^5][^6] His father was of probable Flemish descent and a committed Presbyterian Dissenter—a religious minority subject to persecution in Restoration England.[^7] Defoe's mother Alice died when he was approximately ten years old, leaving a lasting impact on the young boy.[^8]

Defoe's early childhood was marked by catastrophic events that shaped the London he knew. In 1665, he lived through the Great Plague of London, which killed seventy thousand people.[^9] The following year, the Great Fire of London devastated the city, leaving only Defoe's house and two others standing in his neighborhood.[^10] These traumatic experiences would later inform his vivid historical fiction, particularly *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722).

As a Nonconformist, Defoe could not attend Oxford or Cambridge universities, which were restricted to members of the Church of England.[^11] Instead, his father sent him to the excellent Dissenting academy at Newington Green (later Stoke Newington), kept by the Reverend Charles Morton, where he studied from 1674 to 1679.[^12] At Morton's academy, Defoe received an advanced education in science and the humanities, though Latin was notably absent from the curriculum—an omission he regretted throughout his life.[^13] It was under Morton's tutelage that Defoe developed the clear, colloquial writing style that would become his hallmark.[^14]

His parents initially hoped he would become a Presbyterian minister, but after four years at the academy, Defoe decided against entering the ministry and turned his attention to the business world instead.[^15] This decision, though made with "considerable anguish," set him on a path that would combine commerce, politics, and literature in ways few could have predicted.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

Defoe entered the mercantile trade in the early 1680s following an apprenticeship to a hosier.[^17] His business ventures were remarkably diverse and ambitious. He imported wines and brandy from Spain, France, and Portugal, dealt in woolen goods, and engaged in manufacturing, import-export, shipping, insurance, finance, and publishing.[^18] In more unusual enterprises, he borrowed money to make perfume from African civets and established a firm employing a new diving bell technology to recover sunken treasure.[^19]

On January 1, 1684, Defoe married Mary Tuffley at St. Botolph's Aldgate.[^20] She brought with her a substantial dowry of £3,700—a huge sum by the standards of the day.[^21] The marriage would last forty-seven years and produce eight children, of whom six survived to maturity.[^22]

Defoe's early business ventures initially prospered, enabling him to acquire a country estate in Stoke Newington by the late 1680s.[^23] However, his fortunes took a dramatic turn in 1692 when he was forced into bankruptcy with debts totaling £17,000—approaching US$4 million in today's currency.[^24] The immediate cause was his involvement in insurance underwriting: during the war between Britain and France, a French fleet attacked an Anglo-Dutch merchant convoy, resulting in the loss of around ninety ships, and Defoe was among the underwriters liable for the losses.[^25]

On October 29, 1692, Defoe was committed to King's Bench Prison because he owed money to no fewer than 140 creditors.[^26] He managed to negotiate his freedom in February 1693, though he would continue evading debt collectors for the next fifteen years.[^27] Despite this devastating setback, Defoe worked diligently to repay his obligations, reducing his debt to £5,000 by 1705.[^28] During this period, he changed his name from "Foe" to "Defoe," adding the aristocratic-sounding "De" and occasionally making false claims of descent from a family named De Beau Faux.[^29]

Defoe's entry into political writing began in 1683 with his first political pamphlet.[^30] Throughout the reign of William III, he supported the Dutch-born king loyally, becoming his leading pamphleteer.[^31] In 1701, responding to xenophobic attacks on the "foreign" king, Defoe published his vigorous and witty poem *The True-Born Englishman*, which became an enormous popular success—the most widely sold poem in English up to that time, with Defoe estimating more than 80,000 copies sold.[^32][^33] The poem was so well-known that Defoe signed several later works as "The True-Born Englishman," and everyone knew exactly what that meant.[^34]

## Major Achievements

### Literary Innovation and the Novel

At the age of fifty-nine, after a full career as businessman, government servant, political pamphleteer, and journalist, Defoe began his career as a novelist.[^35] Within six years, he produced six novels that would secure his place in literary history.[^36]

His first and most famous novel, *The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe*, was published in April 1719.[^37] The book was an immediate sensation. Before the end of the year, the first volume had run through four editions, and within years, it had reached an audience as wide as any book ever written in English.[^38] By the end of the nineteenth century, no book in Western literature had spawned more editions, spin-offs, and translations than *Robinson Crusoe*, with more than seven hundred alternative versions.[^39] The novel is claimed to be second only to the Bible in its number of translations.[^40] It inspired an entirely new genre, the Robinsonade, exemplified by works such as Johann David Wyss's *The Swiss Family Robinson* (1812).[^41]

The year 1722 was extraordinarily prolific for Defoe—he published no less than six books, including three major novels.[^42] *Moll Flanders*, published in 1722, told the story of a woman born in Newgate Prison who becomes a thief and prostitute before reforming.[^43] *A Journal of the Plague Year* (1722), drawing on Defoe's childhood memories and historical research, provided a vivid first-hand account of the 1665 London plague.[^44] *Colonel Jack* (1722), sharing many plot elements with *Moll Flanders*, followed an orphan who turns to crime before being transported to America and achieving prosperity.[^45]

Defoe also published *Captain Singleton* (1720), an adventure story whose first half anticipated subsequent African discoveries by explorers like David Livingstone, and whose second half tapped into contemporary fascination with piracy.[^46] His final novel, *Roxana: The Fortunate Mistress* (1724), differed from his other works in that the main character—a high society courtesan—does not experience a conversion or redemption, instead narrating a moral and spiritual decline.[^47]

### Journalism and Political Writing

Perhaps Defoe's most remarkable journalistic achievement was *The Review*, a periodical he wrote practically single-handedly from 1704 to 1713.[^48] This serious, forceful, and long-lived paper was a "ground-breaking periodical that moved English journalism in new directions," establishing Defoe as a pioneer of business journalism and economic journalism.[^49][^50]

Beyond fiction, Defoe produced his three-volume *Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain* (1724–1727), an innovative travel book that was groundbreaking partly because Defoe had actually visited the places he described.[^51] The work provided a vivid first-hand account of the state of the country and remains an invaluable historical document.[^52]

### Intelligence and Espionage

Defoe's intelligence career, lasting roughly between 1704 and 1717 (with breaks), saw him embark on three highly successful missions as a secret agent for the British government.[^53] After his imprisonment in 1703, Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and leading minister and spymaster, brokered Defoe's release in exchange for his cooperation as an intelligence agent.[^54]

By September 1706, Harley ordered Defoe to Edinburgh as a secret agent to secure Scottish acquiescence to the proposed union with England.[^55] Together with Harley, Defoe disseminated propaganda and built a network of operatives from London to the upper Highlands, providing the English government with up-to-the-minute intelligence and monitoring adversaries' every move.[^56] Some of his pamphlets were purported to be written by Scots, misleading even reputable historians into quoting them as evidence of Scottish opinion.[^57] The political climate in Scotland was such that had Defoe been discovered, he could very well have been killed.[^58]

Even after the Tories fell from power with the death of Queen Anne, Defoe continued intelligence work for the Whig government, writing "Tory" pamphlets that undermined the Tory point of view.[^59]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Shortest Way Scandal

Defoe's most notorious controversy arose from his December 1702 pamphlet *The Shortest-Way with the Dissenters; Or, Proposals for the Establishment of the Church*, which purported to argue for the extermination of religious Dissenters.[^60] In reality, Defoe ruthlessly satirized both the high church Tories and those Dissenters who hypocritically practiced "occasional conformity."[^61] Published anonymously, the pamphlet's true authorship was quickly discovered, and Defoe was arrested and charged with seditious libel.[^62]

Found guilty at the Old Bailey, Defoe was sentenced to stand three times in the pillory, pay a stiff fine, and remain in prison until he could provide sureties for his good behavior for seven years.[^63] On the last three days of July 1703, he stood in the pillory for an hour each day at three of London's busiest places—outside the Royal Exchange in Cornhill, near the conduit in Cheapside, and in Fleet Street by Temple Bar.[^64]

Although miserably apprehensive of his punishment, Defoe composed the audacious "Hymn to the Pillory" (1703) while awaiting his ordeal, which helped turn the occasion into something of a triumph.[^65] Remarkably, spectators threw flowers at him rather than the usual refuse, while his friends sold copies of "The Shortest Way" and the "Hymn" to the crowds.[^66]

After the pillory, Defoe was confined in Newgate Prison, where he had comparatively comfortable lodgings at his own expense.[^67] His release was secured only through Harley's intervention and his agreement to work as a government propagandist and spy.[^68]

### Financial Failures and Ethical Questions

Defoe's repeated bankruptcies and lifelong struggle with debt raised questions about his financial judgment and business acumen. His 1692 bankruptcy, caused by bad bets, overexpansion, hubris, and high living, left him with debts approaching modern equivalents of millions of dollars.[^69] He suffered further severe losses in 1703 when his prosperous brick-and-tile works near Tilbury failed during his imprisonment.[^70]

His espionage work also raised ethical concerns. Writing propaganda that deliberately misled readers, publishing under at least 148 pen names, and producing "Tory" pamphlets to undermine the Tory cause while serving a Whig government involved considerable deception.[^71][^72]

### Contemporary Condemnation

During his lifetime and in the decades following his death, Defoe faced harsh criticism from literary and political figures. Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and John Gay—leaders of the Scriblerian Club—regarded Defoe with contempt.[^73] Lord Loughborough warned that Defoe was not a "creditable" person to quote, pointing to Pope's *Dunciad*, which depicted Defoe punished in the pillory and damaged his reputation so severely that he could not be cited as an authority on any subject.[^74]

William Minto, author of an 1879 study of Defoe, summed up his assessment by calling Defoe "the greatest liar that ever lived."[^75] Toward the end of the nineteenth century, both Defoe's character and his political career were under attack, with critics disparaging his standing as a writer.[^76]

---

## Personal Life

Daniel Defoe's marriage to Mary Tuffley on January 1, 1684, lasted forty-seven years and produced eight children, though sources vary on how many survived to adulthood—most indicate six survived to maturity.[^77][^78] Named children include his second son, Bernard or Benjamin Norton, and their daughter Sophia Defoe, born in London on December 24, 1701.[^79]

Given his debts and political difficulties, the marriage may have been troubled, though Mary remained with him throughout his turbulent life.[^80] She survived Defoe by about a year and a half, dying in December 1732.[^81]

Defoe's religious convictions remained central to his identity throughout his life. Raised as a Presbyterian Dissenter, he defended religious liberty with special determination, adhering to orthodox Protestant doctrines including the Trinity and predestination at a time when many Presbyterian coreligionists were inclining toward Arminianism and Arianism.[^82][^83] One theme ran through his life: his efforts and sacrifices on behalf of religious liberty in an age of shifting and dangerous crosscurrents of oppression.[^84]

Despite his literary success and prolific output, Defoe's final years were marked by continued financial troubles. He spent his last years hiding from creditors, lodging in a rooming house in Ropemaker's Alley in the Barbican area of central London.[^85] His final years were fraught with legal problems resulting allegedly from unpaid bonds dating back a generation, and he was never able to escape harassment from debtors, including a Mary Brooke.[^86]

Defoe died on April 24, 1731, in Ropemaker's Alley, not far from where he was born in Cripplegate, probably while in hiding from his creditors.[^87] The cause of death was labeled as lethargy, though he probably experienced a stroke.[^88] He died with little wealth and evidently embroiled in lawsuits with the royal treasury.[^89] It remains one of literature's great ironies that despite enormous literary success and productivity, Defoe spent his final days in hiding, dying in relative obscurity in the same London neighborhood where he had been born approximately seventy years earlier.

## Legacy

### Founding the English Novel

Daniel Defoe is considered one of the pioneers of the English novel, and his role in developing the novel as a literary genre ensures that his works are still read and studied today.[^90] He helped establish the English novel as a distinct literary form alongside contemporaries such as Aphra Behn and Samuel Richardson, paving the way for writers like Henry Fielding and Jane Austen.[^91][^92]

### Innovation in Literary Realism

At the beginning of the eighteenth century, realism was revolutionary, and Defoe was among the first writers to practice it.[^93] He is considered a pioneer of realism in English literature, striving to depict life as it truly was, with all its complexities and imperfections.[^94] His focus on the actual conditions of everyday life and avoidance of courtly and heroic conventions made Defoe revolutionary in English literature and helped define the new genre of the novel.[^95]

The most distinctive aspect of his style was his use of first-person narration, with novels typically told through the eyes of a single character, creating a sense of immediacy and authenticity.[^96] His emphasis on realism, first-person narration, and exploration of complex social issues continues to influence writers today.[^97]

### Influence on Journalism

A master of realistic prose, Defoe had an enormous influence on the development of both journalism and the novel.[^98] His vivid storytelling and social insights laid the foundation for modern journalism, particularly business and economic reporting.[^99] *The Review* demonstrated how periodical literature could address serious political and economic issues for a broad readership.[^100]

### Enduring Cultural Impact

*Robinson Crusoe* remains one of the most influential works in Western literature, inspiring countless adaptations, translations, and the entire Robinsonade genre.[^101] By the end of the nineteenth century, it had spawned more editions, spin-offs, and translations than any other book in Western literature except the Bible.[^102]

Defoe's other major novels—*Moll Flanders*, *A Journal of the Plague Year*, *Colonel Jack*, and *Roxana*—continue to be read and studied as important contributions to the development of the novel.[^103] His works remain relevant for their exploration of social mobility, crime, repentance, economic survival, and the human condition.[^104]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Contemporary scholarship has significantly rehabilitated Defoe's reputation from the harsh judgments of earlier centuries. Ashley Marshall and Joseph Hone have demonstrated that Defoe built his contemporary reputation on a mode of satire more wide-reaching, more artful, more cognizant of tradition, and more politically consistent than generations of critics had allowed.[^105]

Modern critics appreciate Defoe's pioneering contributions to literary realism and the development of the novel form. His innovative narrative techniques, including the use of first-person narration and attention to mundane detail, are now recognized as foundational to the modern novel.[^106] By twentieth-century standards, *Moll Flanders*, *Robinson Crusoe*, *Roxana*, and *A Journal of the Plague Year* are seen as important contributions to literary history.[^107]

Scholars also value Defoe's journalism and political writings as important historical documents that provide insight into early eighteenth-century English society, politics, and economics.[^108] His *Tour Through the Whole Island of Great Britain* remains an invaluable resource for understanding the state of Britain in the 1720s.[^109]

His advocacy for religious liberty and tolerance, despite the personal costs of imprisonment and social ostracism, is recognized as a significant contribution to the development of religious freedom in England.[^110] His efforts and sacrifices on behalf of Dissenters demonstrated courage and principle in an age of persecution.[^111]

### Negative Views

Even sympathetic modern critics acknowledge significant flaws in Defoe's work and character. He is criticized for hasty composition, faithlessness to his craft as a novelist, lack of insight into particular characters, and an indifferent sense of unity in his novels.[^112] The rushed nature of his prolific output sometimes resulted in inconsistencies and structural weaknesses.[^113]

Defoe's extensive use of deception—publishing under at least 148 pseudonyms, writing propaganda that deliberately misled readers, and producing pamphlets that misrepresented his true positions—raises fundamental questions about authorial integrity and political honesty.[^114] His work as a double agent, producing "Tory" pamphlets to undermine the Tory cause while serving the Whigs, involved systematic deception that troubled even his defenders.[^115]

His repeated financial failures and inability to manage his debts, despite substantial income from writing and business ventures, suggest poor judgment and perhaps a degree of recklessness.[^116] The fact that he died in hiding from creditors, after a lifetime of debt problems, indicates he never learned from his financial mistakes.[^117]

Some critics continue to question the literary merit of his novels, viewing them as entertaining but lacking the depth and artistry of later novelists like Henry Fielding or Jane Austen.[^118] The episodic structure and sometimes superficial characterization in his works are cited as evidence that he was more journalist than artist.[^119]

Despite these criticisms, the scholarly consensus has shifted dramatically from the contemptuous dismissals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Pat Rogers's *Defoe: The Critical Heritage* (1972) documents this evolution, showing how Defoe's reputation has been continually reassessed.[^120] Defoe remains an author still being assessed critically, with new scholarship continuing to reveal the complexity and importance of his contributions.[^121]
