## Overview

The Salem Witch Trials (1692-1693) were a series of hearings and prosecutions of people accused of witchcraft in colonial Massachusetts. It remains the deadliest witch hunt in the history of colonial North America. Fueled by Puritan religious fervor, local feuds, and mass hysteria, the trials resulted in the execution of 20 innocents (14 women, 6 men) and the imprisonment of hundreds. The episode has become a universal metaphor for mass hysteria, scapegoating, and the dangers of abandoning due process ("witch hunt").

## Background

### Puritan New England

**Theocracy:**
Massachusetts Bay Colony was deeply religious. Believed devil was real and active.

**Tensions in 1692:**
- **Indian Wars:** King William's War raging on frontier. refugees flooding Salem. Fear of attack.
- **Village vs. Town:** Economic feud between Salem Village (farmers) and Salem Town (merchants).
- **Smallpox:** Recent epidemic.
- **Harsh Winter:** "The Devil's work."

### The Accusers

**Betty Parris (9) and Abigail Williams (11):**
Daughter and niece of Reverend Samuel Parris.

**February 1692:**
Girls began having "fits"—screaming, throwing things, contorting bodies. Doctor William Griggs could find no physical cause; diagnosed "bewitchment."

## The Hysteria Begins

### First Accusations

Girls accused three marginalized women:
1. **Tituba:** Parris's enslaved servant (probably Indigenous/Caribbean).
2. **Sarah Good:** Homeless beggar.
3. **Sarah Osborne:** Elderly, impoverished, absent from church.

### The Confession

**Tituba:**
Under beatings, Tituba confessed. Gave detailed descriptions of devil, black dogs, and "red book."
Claimed **others** were involved. Panic spread.

### Spreading Accusations

Accusations moved from outcasts to upstanding church members:
- **Martha Corey** (skeptic of girls)
- **Rebecca Nurse** (pious, elderly grandmother)

If *they* could be witches, anyone could.

## The Trials

### Court of Oyer and Terminer

Established June 1692 by Governor William Phips.

**Use of "Spectral Evidence":**
Crucial legal error. Court accepted claims that accused's "specter" (spirit) appeared to victims in dreams or visions. Only victim could see it—impossible to disprove.

### The First Execution

**Bridget Bishop:**
Hanged June 10, 1692.

### July - September 1692

Executions accelerated.
- **July 19:** 5 hanged (including Rebecca Nurse, Sarah Good).
- **August 19:** 5 hanged (including George Burroughs, former minister who recited Lord's Prayer perfectly on scaffold—witches supposedly couldn't).
- **September 22:** 8 hanged.

### Giles Corey

**Pressed to Death (September 19):**
81-year-old Giles Corey refused to enter a plea (to save his estate for heirs).
Under English law, could not be tried without plea.
**Peine forte et dure:** Heavy stones placed on his chest to force plea.
Died after 2 days. Last words: "More weight."

---

## The End

### Turning Point

**Accusations Went Too Far:**
Girls began accusing powerful people (Governor's wife, Cotton Mather's kin).

**Opposition:**
Reverend Increase Mather (Cotton's father) published *Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits*:
> "It were better that ten suspected witches should escape, than that one innocent person should be condemned."

### Governor Phips Intervenes

**October 12, 1692:**
Governor Phips dissolved Court of Oyer and Terminer. Prohibited spectral evidence in new court.

**May 1693:**
Governor pardoned remaining prisoners. Frenzy ended.

## Theories: Why?

### Explanations

1.  **Ergot Poisoning:** Fungus on rye (LSD-like) caused hallucinations? (Disputed by historians).
2.  **Psychological Hysteria:** Conversion disorder.
3.  **Fraud:** Girls faked it for power/attention.
4.  **Social Conflict:** Accusers (West) vs. Accused (East/Town)—economic resentment.
5.  **Misogyny:** Targeting assertive/independent women.

## Legacy

### Apologies

**1697:** Day of fasting and repentance in Massachusetts.
**1702:** Trials declared unlawful.
**1711:** Financial restitution to heirs.
**1957:** Massachusetts formally apologized.

### Cultural Impact

**"Witch Hunt":**
Term used for McCarthyism (Arthur Miller's *The Crucible*, 1953) and political persecution today.

**Tourism:**
Salem, MA ("Witch City") embraces history. Halloween destination.
