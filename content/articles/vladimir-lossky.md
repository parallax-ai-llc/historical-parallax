## Summary

Vladimir Lossky was a Russian-French Orthodox theologian who was one of the most influential Orthodox voices of the 20th century. His Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church is the most widely read introduction to Eastern Orthodox theology. He emphasized the apophatic (negative) theology of the Church Fathers and the distinction between God's essence and energies. He helped define modern Orthodox theological identity in dialogue with Western theology.
