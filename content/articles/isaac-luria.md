## Summary

Isaac Luria (the Ari) was a Jewish mystic and the founder of Lurianic Kabbalah, the most influential school of Jewish mysticism. His revolutionary concepts of tzimtzum (divine contraction), shevirat ha-kelim (breaking of the vessels), and tikkun (repair) transformed Jewish theology and practice. Though he wrote very little, his teachings were recorded by his disciple Hayyim Vital. His mysticism profoundly influenced Hasidism and modern Jewish thought.
