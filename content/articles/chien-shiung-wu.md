## Summary

Chien-Shiung Wu was a Chinese-American experimental physicist who made significant contributions to nuclear physics. She conducted the Wu experiment, which proved that parity is not conserved in weak interactions, confirming the theoretical prediction of Yang and Lee. Despite the importance of her experimental work, she was controversially not included in the Nobel Prize. Known as the 'First Lady of Physics,' she was the first woman to serve as president of the American Physical Society.
