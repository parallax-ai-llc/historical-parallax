## Summary

James Young Simpson introduced chloroform as an anesthetic for childbirth in 1847, revolutionizing obstetric practice. He championed the use of anesthesia despite fierce opposition from religious authorities who believed labor pain was God's will. Queen Victoria's use of chloroform during childbirth helped legitimize Simpson's innovation.
