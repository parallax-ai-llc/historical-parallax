## Summary

Yi Ha-ung (1821-1898), known by his title Heungseon Daewongun, was the de facto ruler of Korea's Joseon Dynasty during the 1860s and early 1870s as regent for his young son, King Gojong.[^1] A member of the royal House of Yi, he rose from poverty and political obscurity to become one of the most powerful and controversial figures in Korean history.[^2] His decade-long regency was marked by sweeping domestic reforms aimed at strengthening royal authority and crushing aristocratic corruption, coupled with a rigorous isolationist foreign policy that prohibited contact with Western powers.[^3] His legacy remains contested, with historians debating whether his actions represented defensive nationalism or self-defeating isolationism that left Korea vulnerable to later colonization.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Yi Ha-ung was born on January 24, 1821, in Hanseong (modern-day Seoul), the fourth son of Yi Gu, who held the title Prince Namyeon.[^5] Through his father, he was a ninth-generation descendant of King Injo through Grand Prince Inpyeong, establishing his membership in the Jeonju Yi clan, the royal house of Joseon.[^6] Despite his royal lineage, Yi Ha-ung's early life was characterized by poverty and humiliation, as the dominant Andong Kim clan monopolized court positions and systematically excluded other royal family members from political power.[^7]

The Andong Kim family had maneuvered themselves into extraordinary control during the late Joseon period, taking advantage of the deterioration of the royal line and pursuing a bloody campaign to dominate the royal house that drove almost all representatives of the royal family from Seoul.[^8] Barred from obtaining high political positions despite his royal blood, Yi Ha-ung lived in near poverty and supported himself by creating and selling paintings of orchids to Korean noblemen.[^9] This experience cultivated both his artistic talents and a deep resentment of aristocratic corruption.

Well-schooled in Confucianism and the Chinese classics, Yi Ha-ung reputedly excelled in calligraphy and painting, becoming a pupil of Kim Jeong-hui, one of the greatest calligraphers of the Joseon dynasty.[^10] His education in traditional Korean scholarship would later inform his conservative political philosophy and his commitment to preserving Confucian orthodoxy against Western influences.[^11] In 1831, at age thirteen, Yi Ha-ung married Lady Min (born Min Chi-Gu's daughter), who would become Grand Internal Princess Consort Sunmok and the mother of the future King Gojong.[^12]

The couple had five children: a daughter born in 1838, Prince Imperial Heungchin born August 22, 1845, the future King Gojong born September 9, 1852, and two additional daughters in 1854 and 1863.[^13] Little did Yi Ha-ung know that his second son's birth would dramatically alter the trajectory of Korean history and elevate him from obscurity to supreme power.

## Rise to Power

Yi Ha-ung's extraordinary ascent to power began in January 1864 when King Cheoljong died without leaving a male heir.[^14] The succession crisis that followed provided an unexpected opportunity for the impoverished prince. Through a combination of political maneuvering and adherence to proper succession formalities, Yi Ha-ung's twelve-year-old son Yi Myeong-bok was selected to ascend the throne as King Gojong.[^15] The Andong Kim clan, which had dominated the court for decades, found themselves powerless to prevent this succession because the traditional protocols had been scrupulously observed.[^16]

Because of Gojong's young age, Yi Ha-ung was declared "Regent Heungseon Daewongun" and granted the power to rule in his son's stead.[^17] This title was unprecedented; in the history of Joseon, four different men received the title of "Daewongun," but Heungseon Daewongun was the only one to receive it while still alive, with the other three receiving it posthumously.[^18] This unique distinction reflected both the extraordinary circumstances of his regency and the authority he would wield.

From the moment he assumed power, the Daewongun moved swiftly and decisively to consolidate control and dismantle the power structures that had excluded him and weakened the monarchy. Within a few years, he secured complete control of the court, successfully disposing of the last of the Andong Kims, whose corruption he believed was responsible for the country's decline in the nineteenth century.[^19] He weakened the Andong Kim clan's power dramatically and increased the authority of the ruling family, stripping them of almost all their former influence.[^20] This brutal but effective purge eliminated the factional politics that had paralyzed the government for decades.

The Daewongun recruited officials regardless of faction, a meritocratic approach that broke with the corrupt practices of clan-based appointments.[^21] He weakened the forces of the powerful Sedo families by largely reducing the functions of the Border Defense Council (Bibyeonsa), revived the function of the State Council of Joseon (Uijeonbu), and set up the Three Armies Headquarters (Samgunbu) to separately administer political and military affairs.[^22] These structural reforms aimed to centralize power in the monarchy and create a more efficient administrative apparatus.

## Major Achievements

### Administrative and Political Reforms

The Daewongun inaugurated a far-ranging reform program to strengthen the central administration, modernize and increase its armies, and rationalize the bureaucracy.[^23] His appointment of government officials based on ability and merit rather than family connections represented a significant break from the nepotistic practices that had characterized recent Joseon governance.[^24] This meritocratic approach brought fresh talent into government and reduced the stranglehold of aristocratic families on state positions.

Earnestly dedicated to Confucian ethics, the Daewongun embarked immediately on a campaign to remove corruption from all levels of government.[^25] His anti-corruption drive extended beyond personnel changes to include structural reforms designed to prevent the accumulation of unchecked power by any single faction or family. By dismantling the seowon system and redistributing political authority, he sought to create a more balanced and accountable government structure.

### Tax and Economic Reforms

One of the Daewongun's most significant and controversial achievements was his restructuring of the tax system. He mandated that the yangban (aristocratic class) pay military cloth taxes, ending their centuries-old tax exemption.[^26] This bold move directly challenged the privileges of the elite class and generated substantial resistance from the aristocracy. Simultaneously, he reduced taxes for the peasantry to alleviate their burden, attempting to create a more equitable fiscal system.[^27]

These tax reforms aimed both to increase government revenue and to address the severe economic inequality that had destabilized Korean society. By forcing the wealthy to contribute to state finances while providing relief to commoners, the Daewongun sought to strengthen the fiscal foundation of the state while reducing popular discontent. However, the funding demands of his ambitious projects would ultimately undermine these economic reforms.

### Closure of Seowon Academies

In 1871, the Daewongun implemented one of his most dramatic reforms: the nationwide closure of seowon (Confucian private academies).[^28] Of the more than 650 seowon that existed across Korea, only 47 survived the decree.[^29] These institutions had originally served as centers of Confucian learning, but over time had evolved into family and factional power bases that enjoyed special privileges, held large landholdings, and threatened to develop a parallel system to the government.[^30]

The seowon had become epicenters of factional power, particularly for the Andong Kim clan, and their closure struck directly at the aristocratic families' ability to maintain regional influence independent of the central government.[^31] The Daewongun imposed taxes on the surviving seowon despite bitter opposition from Confucian scholars who viewed the institutions as essential to maintaining traditional Korean culture and education.[^32] This reform reduced the tyranny of local clans and contributed to the stability of national finances and people's lives, though it generated intense resentment among the scholarly elite.[^33]

### Reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace

Perhaps the most visible and controversial of the Daewongun's achievements was the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace, which had lain in ruins for nearly three centuries.[^34] In 1865, Queen Sinjeong ordered the reconstruction with supervision delegated to the Heungseon Daewongun, who wielded actual power during this period.[^35] The rebuilding took seven years and five months and was evaluated as one of the largest and most expensive construction projects of the late Joseon period.[^36]

The palace reconstruction served multiple purposes beyond mere architectural restoration. It was intended to symbolize the revival of royal authority and the restoration of monarchical power after decades of aristocratic domination. The Daewongun even manufactured a positive omen by having a piece of jade engraved with a message warding off fire "discovered" at the construction site to build enthusiasm for the project.[^37] This manipulation demonstrated his sophisticated understanding of political theater and symbolism.

However, the immense cost of the project proved politically catastrophic. The large-scale construction work became the object of complaint from most noblemen and common people alike, ultimately causing economic disaster and contributing to the Daewongun's fall from political power.[^38]

### Military Modernization

The Daewongun recognized the destructive power and progressiveness of Western weapons after the foreign incursions of the 1860s and 1870s, and initiated programs to develop new weapons.[^39] Representative innovations included body armor made by overlapping fibers and torpedoes (underwater mines).[^40] Thanks to these military improvements, Korean troops were able to repel French and American expeditionary forces despite suffering significant damage during the Byeongin Yangyo (French campaign of 1866) and Shinmiyangyo (American expedition of 1871).[^41]

These military victories, though achieved at great cost, reinforced the Daewongun's conviction that Korea could maintain its independence through strength and isolation. The successful defense against Western powers became a source of national pride and seemed to validate his isolationist policies, though historians would later debate whether these short-term victories contributed to Korea's long-term vulnerability.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Isolationist Foreign Policy

The Daewongun's foreign policy was starkly simple and uncompromising: "no treaties, no trade, no Catholics, no West, and no Japan."[^42] This rigid isolationism, designed to protect Joseon from what he perceived as cultural and political imperialism, became one of his most controversial legacies.[^43] During the mid-1860s, the Daewongun was the main proponent of isolationism and the driving force behind policies that led directly to violent conflicts with Western powers.[^44]

Following armed conflicts with France in 1866 and the United States in 1871, the Daewongun ordered the erection of anti-appeasement steles across Korea in April 1871.[^45] These monuments bore twelve Chinese characters reading: "The Western barbarians have invaded. To not fight is to advocate peace. To advocate peace is to sell out the country."[^46] Small characters added: "Let this be a warning to our offspring for the next ten-thousand years."[^47] Over twenty of these steles survived to modern times and were designated as cultural heritage sites, though most were demolished at the request of the Japanese government during the colonial period.[^48]

The isolationist policy became even more entrenched after two particularly egregious incidents. In 1868, German merchant Ernst Oppert, frustrated by Korea's closed markets, attempted to rob the grave of the Daewongun's father, Prince Namyeon, planning to hold the bones hostage to force Korea to open to trade.[^49] Though the grave robbers failed to break through the tomb's cover stone and were driven off by Korean soldiers and villagers, the incident deeply traumatized the Daewongun and reinforced his view of Westerners as barbaric and untrustworthy.[^50]

Historian Hilary Conroy described the Daewongun's reign as characterized by "vigorous enforcement of the seclusion policy, persecution of Christians, and the killing or driving off of foreigners who landed on Korean soil."[^51] Because he refused entirely to engage in international relations, Korea had limited market choices and slim opportunity for an Industrial Revolution to occur, leaving the country economically and technologically stagnant while neighboring Japan rapidly modernized.[^52]

### Catholic Persecution

The Byeongin Persecution of 1866-1871, sometimes called the Great Persecution under the rule of the Daewongun, was the final and most severe persecution of Catholics under the Joseon Dynasty.[^53] In January 1866, when the Daewongun's decree to suppress Catholicism was promulgated, nine out of twelve French missionaries were executed along with an estimated 8,000 Korean Catholics in just a few months.[^54] The brutality and scale of this persecution shocked the international community and provided the pretext for the French punitive expedition later that year.

Ironically, historical sources suggest that the Daewongun originally had no intention of suppressing Catholicism and harbored no particular antipathy toward it, even considering the possibility of interacting with Western powers such as France via Catholic connections.[^55] However, he implemented the persecution policy to prevent his political position from being shaken by internal and external changes, demonstrating how political expediency could override personal inclination.[^56] This pragmatic brutality revealed the Daewongun's willingness to sacrifice thousands of lives to maintain his grip on power.

The persecution led directly to the French Campaign against Korea in October 1866, when Admiral Roze invaded Ganghwa Island with a force of nearly 1,000 men.[^57] Though the French eventually withdrew after several weeks of fighting and heavy casualties, they pillaged Korean archives before departing, causing irreparable cultural damage.[^58]

### The General Sherman Incident and American Expedition

In August 1866, the American merchant ship General Sherman arrived off the western Korean coast attempting to force open trade relations in violation of Korean law.[^59] When Korean officials informed Captain Page that he was not allowed to trade in Korea, these instructions were ignored.[^60] The ship became stranded on a sandbar when the water receded, and the King-Regent ordered the ship burned and the crew killed as they attempted to escape ashore.[^61] All aboard perished, including American crew members, Chinese sailors, and Welsh missionary Robert Jermain Thomas.[^62]

Five years later in 1871, the United States dispatched a punitive military expedition to Korea, in part to ascertain the fate of the General Sherman and demand an apology.[^63] The American force consisted of approximately 650 men and five warships under the command of Rear Admiral John Rodgers.[^64] On June 1, Korean forces ambushed the American expedition as it sailed up the Han River, beginning the conflict known as Shinmiyangyo.[^65]

The Battle of Ganghwa resulted in lopsided casualties: only three Americans killed and ten wounded, compared to 243 Koreans counted dead by Americans (Korean sources cite 350), with twenty Koreans captured and approximately 100 additional Korean soldiers drowning by suicide.[^66] Despite the overwhelming military defeat, the Korean government maintained its isolationist stance, refusing to sign a trade treaty with the United States until 1882.[^67] The Daewongun interpreted the American withdrawal after their military victory as validation of his isolationist policies, though critics argue this misreading of the situation contributed to Korea's later vulnerabilities.

### Economic Mismanagement and Palace Reconstruction

The financing of Gyeongbokgung Palace reconstruction proved economically disastrous and politically ruinous for the Daewongun. Funding was procured through "voluntary payment" (wŏnnapchŏn) from mostly yangban people from around Korea, though these payments were actually mostly explicitly or implicitly coerced or rewarded with government benefits or later compensation.[^68] This system of forced contributions generated intense resentment among the elite classes who were already antagonized by the Daewongun's other reforms.

The palace construction was controversial among the elite, who criticized the enormous expense of the project.[^69] Economic measures such as new levies and corvée labor imposed heavy burdens on peasants and merchants, fueling domestic unrest without yielding sustainable fiscal or administrative gains.[^70] The combination of economic strain and aristocratic resentment created the coalition that would ultimately drive the Daewongun from power.

### Authoritarian Centralization

Critics fault the Daewongun's authoritarian centralization, which dismantled entrenched noble factions through purges and executions but relied excessively on personal loyalty and coercion.[^71] His approach sowed seeds of factional backlash that culminated in his 1873 ouster.[^72] While aimed at restoring royal authority, these methods prioritized short-term consolidation over broad-based stability, leaving a legacy of policy rigidity amid mounting internal and external pressures.[^73]

## Personal Life

Yi Ha-ung married Lady Min in 1831 when she was thirteen years old.[^74] Born on March 9, 1818, as the eldest daughter of Min Chi-Gu and his wife Lady Yi of the Jeonju Yi clan, she became a Korean noblewoman and Joseon dynasty royal family member through marriage.[^75] When Yi Myeong-bok was crowned as King Gojong in autumn 1864, Yi Ha-ung received the title Grand Internal Prince Heungseon (Daewongun), and Lady Min became Grand Internal Princess Consort Yeoheung.[^76]

The couple's relationship appears to have been stable throughout Yi Ha-ung's political career, though historical records focus more on his political activities than his domestic life. Lady Min supported her husband during his years of poverty and remained by his side through his rise to power and subsequent falls from grace. She was also the biological mother of Emperor Gojong of Korea, making her one of the most important women in late Joseon history.[^77]

Yi Ha-ung was described by contemporaries in complex and sometimes contradictory terms. The Korea Repository characterized him as "a man of iron will, resolute purpose, an ardent lover of his country, and a thorough going statesman of the old conservative type."[^78] American diplomat Horace Allen wrote that he thought him "a man of strong will and convictions, honest to purpose, determined, yet with a vein of kindness back of it all."[^79] These descriptions suggest a multifaceted personality combining rigid determination with occasional compassion.

The Daewongun's personality revealed itself in small interactions as well as grand political gestures. In one recorded incident, when American missionary Horace G. Underwood was taking food to King Gojong, the Daewongun asked: "Why do you take all that good food in to him [the king]. He doesn't need it. I am old, my teeth are gone, I need it more than he."[^80] This comment, whether humorous or serious, reveals a man comfortable expressing his needs directly, even somewhat irreverently regarding his royal son.

In another documented statement to a foreign legation servant, he said: "Remember always that you are a Korean, and do all you can to help your country — even though you serve in a foreigner's house."[^81] This advice encapsulated his nationalistic philosophy and his view that Korean identity should transcend individual circumstances or employment.

Beyond politics, Yi Ha-ung was a connoisseur of calligraphy and paintings, as well as an excellent calligrapher and artist in his own right.[^82] He gained particular acclaim for his masterful paintings of orchids, which he had initially created and sold to support himself during his impoverished years.[^83] Many of his orchid paintings bear his name or his penname, Seokpa.[^84] A notable portrait of Yi Haeung from circa 1869, painted by Yi Hancheol with Yu Sook, shows him dressed in his most formal attire known as "geumgwan jobok" and is designated as Treasure 1499-2, housed at the National Museum of Korea.[^85]

Several of his artistic works have appeared at auction, including orchid and rock paintings as well as calligraphic couplets, demonstrating his skill in both painting and calligraphy.[^86] His artistic pursuits were not merely hobbies but connected to his Confucian education and identity as a scholar-official. Orchids in Korean painting tradition served as symbols of love and beauty, fragrance and refinement, emblematic of the superior or even perfect man—an ideal the Daewongun aspired to embody.[^87]

---

## Legacy

The Daewongun died on February 22, 1898, just a little over a year after the formation of the Korean Empire.[^88] On August 24, 1907, Emperor Sunjong bestowed him the posthumous title Internal King Heungseon Heonui, recognizing his extraordinary role in Korean history despite the controversies that marked his career.[^89] His legacy remains one of the most contested in Korean history, with evaluations varying dramatically depending on the criteria and perspective employed.

Until his death, the Daewongun remained a key political figure of late Joseon Korea, attempting multiple returns to power and influencing events even when not holding official positions.[^90] His persistent involvement in Korean politics across four decades demonstrates both his personal ambition and the enduring impact of his initial regency on Korean political structures. He is widely recognized as the person who had the greatest influence on Joseon politics in the late nineteenth century.[^91]

Many Koreans debate whether, had the Daewongun chosen to engage with foreign countries as his daughter-in-law Queen Min advocated, Japanese rule of Korea could have been avoided.[^92] This counterfactual question reflects the profound sense of historical regret surrounding Korea's colonization and the search for moments when different choices might have altered the trajectory toward Japanese domination. Others argue that the ten years of the Isolation Policy was too small a part of the Joseon Dynasty to derive such sweeping conclusions, suggesting that deeper structural problems made colonization difficult to avoid regardless of the Daewongun's policies.[^93]

The Isolation Policy provided immediate benefits by fortifying Korean patriotism and protecting Korean Confucianism from foreign influences.[^94] The Daewongun was able to protect Joseon from cultural imperialism and westernization, thus preserving Korea's heritage from foreign contamination as he understood it.[^95] From this perspective, his policies represented a principled defense of Korean sovereignty and cultural integrity against aggressive Western imperialism and the destabilizing forces of modernization.

However, the long-term consequences of isolationism proved devastating. While Japan underwent rapid modernization following the Meiji Restoration of 1868, Korea remained technologically and economically stagnant, falling further behind its neighbors with each passing year. When Korea was finally forced to open to foreign trade with the Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876—negotiated after the Daewongun's fall from power—the country lacked the industrial base, modern military, and diplomatic experience necessary to navigate the dangerous international environment of late nineteenth-century imperialism.

The Daewongun's domestic reforms showed greater prescience and achieved more lasting impact. His efforts to centralize royal authority, eliminate corruption, and reduce aristocratic privilege addressed real structural problems in the Joseon political system. The closure of seowon academies and the rationalization of the tax system represented attempts to modernize government administration and fiscal policy, even if implemented through authoritarian means. Nine of the surviving seowon have since been designated as UNESCO World Heritage sites, ironically preserving institutions the Daewongun sought to eliminate.[^96]

His artistic legacy endures in museums and private collections. The National Museum of Korea holds several of his works, including orchid paintings that demonstrate his considerable talent.[^97] These artworks remind us that the Daewongun was not merely a politician but also a cultivated scholar and artist in the traditional Korean mold, embodying the Confucian ideal of the scholar-official even as his policies created catastrophic consequences.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of the Daewongun emphasize his genuine patriotism and his attempts to strengthen Korea against both internal corruption and external threats. The Korea Repository's description of him as "an ardent lover of his country" reflects this sympathetic interpretation of his motives.[^98] From this perspective, his isolationist policies represented a rational response to aggressive Western imperialism that had already colonized much of Asia and forced unequal treaties on China and Japan.

Scholars who view the Daewongun positively argue that his domestic reforms addressed critical weaknesses in the Joseon system. His meritocratic appointment policies, tax reforms, and efforts to reduce aristocratic privilege all aimed at creating a more efficient and equitable government. The successful military defeats of French and American expeditionary forces demonstrated that his military modernization efforts had some merit and that Korean independence could be defended through strength and determination.[^99]

The Daewongun's protection of Korean cultural heritage from Western influence appeals to those who value cultural continuity and resist globalization. His policies preserved traditional Confucian values and Korean identity during a period when many Asian societies were abandoning their cultural traditions in pursuit of Western-style modernization. From this nationalist perspective, the Daewongun stands as a principled defender of Korean sovereignty who refused to compromise his nation's independence and cultural integrity.

Some historians argue that the Daewongun's failures resulted more from circumstances beyond his control than from flawed policies. The global power imbalance of the nineteenth century made it nearly impossible for small nations like Korea to maintain independence regardless of their policies. Japan's successful modernization was exceptional, not typical, and Korea might have faced colonization even with more open policies given the predatory international environment and the competing ambitions of Japan, China, and Western powers.

### Negative Views

Critics of the Daewongun focus on how his isolationist policies left Korea vulnerable and unprepared for the challenges of the modern world. Historian Hilary Conroy's characterization of his "vigorous enforcement of the seclusion policy, persecution of Christians, and the killing or driving off of foreigners" emphasizes the brutal and short-sighted nature of his approach.[^100] From this perspective, the Daewongun's rigid ideology blinded him to changing global realities and prevented Korea from acquiring the technology, diplomatic skills, and international relationships necessary for survival in the modern world.

The Catholic persecution of 1866 represents an inexcusable atrocity in this critical view. The execution of nine French missionaries and approximately 8,000 Korean Catholics based on political expediency reveals a callous disregard for human life and religious freedom.[^101] These killings not only violated basic human rights but also proved counterproductive by providing Western powers with a pretext for military intervention, ultimately weakening rather than strengthening Korean security.

Critics fault the Daewongun's authoritarian methods and their long-term political consequences. His purges and executions of noble factions, while effective in the short term, created lasting resentments that destabilized his regime.[^102] The reliance on coercion rather than consensus-building meant that his reforms lacked sustainable political support and were largely undone after his fall from power in 1873.[^103] This pattern suggests that his approach prioritized immediate power consolidation over building lasting institutional changes.

The economic burden of Gyeongbokgung Palace reconstruction exemplifies the Daewongun's misguided priorities in this negative assessment. Spending enormous resources on symbolic palace construction while Korea faced existential threats from foreign powers demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of Korea's strategic situation. The forced contributions and corvée labor alienated both elites and commoners, undermining the regime's stability without providing commensurate benefits.[^104]

Perhaps most damning is the counterfactual argument that the Daewongun's isolationism contributed directly to Japanese colonization. If Korea had engaged with Western powers and pursued modernization as Japan did, it might have developed the military and economic strength to resist Japanese imperialism. The Treaty of Ganghwa in 1876, negotiated after the Daewongun's fall, opened Korea to foreign trade but came too late for Korea to catch up with Japan's three-decade head start in modernization. By the time Korea began modernizing, Japan had already developed into a regional power capable of conquering its neighbor.

Modern Korean historiography reveals ongoing debate between interpretations of the Daewongun's foreign policy as defensive nationalism versus self-defeating isolationism.[^105] This scholarly disagreement reflects the complexity of assessing historical figures whose actions had both principled motivations and catastrophic consequences. The Daewongun remains one of those historical figures whose evaluations are very mixed both in his time and in modern times, making definitive assessment extremely difficult.[^106]
