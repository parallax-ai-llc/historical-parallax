## Summary

Noh Su (盧遂, 1515–1584) was a Confucian scholar of the Joseon Dynasty who played a modest but meaningful role in the intellectual and educational life of his time. Though not among the most prominent figures of his era, he was respected within scholarly circles, having studied under notable intellectuals and contributed to the establishment of important educational institutions. He chose to focus on local community education and virtue cultivation rather than pursuing high government office.

## Early Life and Background

Noh Su was born in 1515 during the reign of King Jungjong of Joseon. He belonged to the Gwangju Noh clan (光州盧氏), an established noble family. His courtesy name was Yeoseong (汝成), and he was also known by his pen names Soam (小庵) and Sagok (沙谷). He spent much of his life in Yeongcheon, Gyeongsang Province, where he would later establish himself as a scholar and community leader.

## Education and Mentorship

Noh Su studied under Samjokdang Kim Dae-yu (金大有), from whom he received foundational Confucian education. His intellectual development was further enhanced when he came under the mentorship of Yi Hwang (李滉), better known as Toegye, one of the most influential Neo-Confucian philosophers of the Joseon Dynasty. Yi Hwang, recognizing Noh Su's scholarly potential, gifted him important Neo-Confucian texts that shaped his philosophical outlook.

## Academic and Community Contributions

At age 45, Noh Su passed the Saengwon examination (生員試), which qualified him for government service. However, he chose to decline pursuing official positions, instead dedicating himself to scholarly work and community education. This decision reflected his commitment to moral cultivation and local development over political ambition.

In 1553, Noh Su co-founded Imgo Seowon (臨皐書院) alongside Kim Eung-saeng and Jeong Yun-ryang. This academy was established to honor the memory and teachings of Jeong Mong-ju, an important Confucian figure from an earlier period. Through this institution, Noh Su contributed to the preservation and transmission of Confucian scholarship in his region.

Beyond institutional work, Noh Su also established village compacts (hyangyak) in his community, implementing practical measures to promote moral education and social harmony among local residents. These initiatives reflected Neo-Confucian values focused on self-cultivation and community welfare.

## Literary Works

Though his literary output was modest, Noh Su authored several important moral and philosophical texts, including:

- "Gyeongsinj am" (敬身箴) - emphasizing the cultivation of respect in personal conduct
- "Samseongjam" (三省箴) - exploring the practice of daily self-reflection and moral examination

## Later Life and Legacy

Noh Su lived to age 80, passing away on September 19, 1584. While historical records about him are limited, he is remembered as a dedicated scholar who prioritized education and community virtue over personal advancement. His contributions to Imgo Seowon and village education initiatives had lasting effects on intellectual and moral development in his region.

## Historical Significance

Noh Su represents an important category of Joseon Dynasty scholars—those who chose to work within their local communities rather than in the capital bureaucracy. Though not a major historical figure on a national scale, his life exemplifies the Neo-Confucian commitment to education, moral cultivation, and community service that characterized the scholarly elite of his era.
