## Overview

**Injong** (1515–1545) was the 12th King of Joseon. He is remembered as the personification of Confucian **Filial Piety**.
He was the son of King Jungjong and Queen Janggyeong (who died giving birth to him).
His stepmother was the terrifying **Queen Munjeong**.
Injong's reign was the shortest in Joseon history: roughly **9 months**.

## The Poisoned Tteok (Rice Cake) Legend

Unofficial history (and popular rumor) claims Queen Munjeong hated Injong because she wanted her own son (later King Myeongjong) to be King.
The Legend:
One day, the Queen suddenly acted nicely to Injong and offered him **Tteok** (rice cakes).
Injong, happy to receive "motherly love" for the first time, ate them, even though he suspected they might be poisoned. He felt that "If my mother wants me dead, it is filial piety to die."
He fell ill and died shortly after.
(Historians note he was sickly all his life, but the timing was suspicious).

## The Burning Palace Rumor

Another famous story:
When Injong was Crown Prince, his palace caught fire at night.
Injong just sat there, waiting to burn to death, thinking "Mother set this fire. If I escape, I am unfilial."
His father Jungjong called out to him from outside. Hearing his father's voice, Injong said "Father is calling," and finally ran out.

## Reign

During his brief 9 months, he tried to reinstate the scholars (Sarim faction) who had been purged by his father in the Gimyo Sahwa (Jo Gwang-jo purge). He was an idealist, but he had no time.
His death allowed Queen Munjeong to rule as regent for her young son Myeongjong, leading to 20 years of corruption and tyranny.
