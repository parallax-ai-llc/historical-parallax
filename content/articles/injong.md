## Summary

Injong (born March 10, 1515; died August 8, 1545) was the 12th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning for less than a year (1544–1545). He is often remembered as the "Saint King" for his benevolent character and extreme filial piety, especially towards his stepmother, **Queen Munjeong**. However, his short reign ended abruptly with his mysterious death at the age of 30, which many historians and popular rumors attribute to poisoning by Queen Munjeong, who wanted her own son (Myeongjong) to be king.[^1]

## The Saintly Prince

Injong was the first son of King Jungjong and Queen Janggyeong (who died shortly after his birth).
*   **Filial Piety:** He was raised by his stepmother, Queen Munjeong. Despite her harsh treatment and alleged attempts to harm him (such as practically setting his palace on fire), Injong remained famously devoted to her, believing his virtue would eventually move her heart.[^2]
*   **Reforms:** Upon ascending the throne, he attempted to reform the corrupt government and reinstate the Sarim scholars who had been purged during his father's reign (by Jo Gwang-jo). He was seen as a great hope for the dynasty.[^3]

## Mysterious Death

Injong died suddenly only 9 months after becoming king.
*   **The Poisoned Tteok:** A persistent historical rumor claims that Queen Munjeong visited him with a smile and offered him poisoned rice cakes (tteok). Injong, knowing they might be poisoned but unwilling to refuse his mother, ate them and fell ill, dying shortly after.[^4]
*   **Official Record:** The Annals state he died of illness exacerbated by extreme grief and fasting following his father Jungjong's funeral. However, the timing was highly convenient for Queen Munjeong's faction.[^5]
