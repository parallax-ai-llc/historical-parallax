## Summary

Jorge Rafael Videla was an Argentine military dictator who served as President of Argentina from 1976 to 1981 during the National Reorganization Process[^1]. He led the military coup that overthrew Isabel Perón on March 24, 1976, and headed a brutal junta that systematically murdered or "disappeared" an estimated 30,000 people during Argentina's "Dirty War"[^2]. Videla was convicted of crimes against humanity in 1985, later pardoned, then re-convicted in 2010 and 2012, ultimately dying in prison in 2013[^3]. His rule is remembered as one of the cruelest dictatorships in Latin American history[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Jorge Rafael Videla was born on August 2, 1925, in the provincial city of Mercedes, Argentina, located approximately 75 miles from Buenos Aires[^5]. He was the third of five sons born to Colonel Rafael Eugenio Videla Bengolea (1888–1952) and María Olga Redondo Ojea (1897–1987)[^6]. Videla was christened in honor of two older twin brothers who had died of measles in 1923[^7]. His family was prominent in San Luis Province, with many ancestors holding high public offices, including his grandfather Jacinto, who served as governor of San Luis between 1891 and 1893[^8].

Growing up in a military family, Videla naturally gravitated toward military service. His father, Colonel Rafael Videla, was a career military officer who instilled in him the values of discipline, hierarchy, and nationalist ideology that would later shape his political worldview[^9]. The Videla family came from an old established lineage in Mercedes, giving young Jorge Rafael connections to Argentina's traditional elite[^10].

Videla joined the National Military College (Colegio Militar de la Nación) on March 3, 1942, at the age of 16, beginning his formal military education[^11]. He graduated on December 21, 1944, with the rank of second lieutenant, entering the Argentine Army during a period of significant political transformation in Argentina[^12]. After steady promotion as a junior officer in the infantry, he attended the War College between 1952 and 1954, graduating as a qualified staff officer[^13]. This advanced military education prepared him for the strategic and command positions he would later occupy.

During his early career, Videla held a variety of posts that shaped his military and diplomatic experience. He served as an instructor and staff officer at the Military College, where he trained the next generation of Argentine officers[^14]. From 1956 to 1958, he was stationed in the United States as an advisor to the Argentine embassy in Washington, where he developed relationships with American military and diplomatic officials[^15]. He returned to the United States on two later assignments—once as a member of the Inter-American Defense Board and again for training at Fort Myer, Virginia[^16]. He also served in diplomatic missions in Bolivia and Venezuela, gaining exposure to regional military cultures and Cold War anti-communist doctrines[^17].

## Rise to Power

Videla rose steadily through the military ranks during the politically turbulent 1960s and 1970s, becoming a brigadier general by 1971[^18]. In 1971, he was appointed commander of the Military College, a position he held until 1973[^19]. That year, he became Chief of the Army's General Staff, one of the most important positions in Argentina's military hierarchy[^20]. In August 1975, President Isabel Perón, under pressure from the military establishment and facing mounting chaos, appointed General Videla as commander in chief of the army[^21].

Argentina in the mid-1970s was in crisis. Isabel Perón, who had succeeded her husband Juan Perón after his death in 1974, presided over a government plagued by economic collapse, soaring inflation—which reached 481% in the ten months between May 1975 and March 1976, nearly 50% per month—and escalating political violence[^22][^23]. Left-wing guerrilla groups such as the Montoneros and the People's Revolutionary Army (ERP) carried out kidnappings, bombings, and assassinations, while right-wing death squads responded with their own campaign of terror[^24]. The country appeared to be descending into civil war.

Unhappy with Perón's leadership, particularly in the face of terrorist attacks from Marxist guerrilla organizations, Videla and his military supporters began planning a coup[^25]. On March 24, 1976, Videla headed a military coup that deposed Isabel Perón during a period of increasing violence, social unrest, and economic problems[^26]. The coup was bloodless and met with little resistance; indeed, many Argentines initially welcomed it, hoping the military would restore order[^27].

Two days after the coup, Videla formally assumed the post of President of Argentina[^28]. A military junta was formed, consisting of Videla representing the Army, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera representing the Navy, and Brigadier General Orlando Ramón Agosti representing the Air Force[^29]. The political process they initiated took the official name of "National Reorganization Process" (Proceso de Reorganización Nacional), and different juntas remained in power until the return to democracy on December 10, 1983[^30].

## Major Achievements

### Military Victory Against Guerrillas

From a military perspective, Videla and the junta achieved their stated objective of defeating the left-wing insurgency that had plagued Argentina throughout the early 1970s. By 1978, the armed guerrilla movements had been effectively destroyed through a comprehensive counterinsurgency campaign[^31]. The military portrayed this as saving Argentina from communist subversion and civil war, a narrative that resonated with conservative sectors of Argentine society and with the United States during the Cold War[^32].

### Economic Reforms

Videla largely delegated economic policy to his Minister of Economy, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, a member of Argentina's economic elite who had the personal friendship of David Rockefeller[^33]. Martínez de Hoz implemented sweeping neoliberal reforms that represented a dramatic reversal of Argentina's traditional Peronist economic model of import-substitution industrialization[^34]. The reforms included aggressive trade liberalization, removing protectionist barriers that had shielded Argentine industry, reducing the size of the public sector, and promoting foreign investment[^35].

The economic program pursued between 1976 and 1981 opened the economy to foreign competition using lower tariffs, froze wages by law while allowing prices to rise, and implemented monetarist policies influenced by the ideas of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek[^36][^37]. Chase Manhattan Bank and the International Monetary Fund provided loans of nearly $1 billion following Martínez de Hoz's appointment, with an additional $100 million IMF loan coming almost immediately after the coup[^38]. These policies were moderately successful in some areas, with economic growth being sporadic: real GDP declined by 1.7% in 1976, rose by 5.2% in 1977, fell again by 3.2% in 1978, and then rose by 7.3% in 1979[^39].

### 1978 World Cup

Argentina successfully hosted and won the 1978 FIFA World Cup under Videla's presidency[^40]. The military regime gave top priority to organizing the World Cup from the moment they took power, with objectives far from sports-related—to use festivities as propaganda and ensure economic stability[^41]. Videla, who was not a fan of soccer and found it interesting only as a "symbol of popular transcendence," understood how immensely popular the sport was, and just hours after seizing power, he and other military leaders found time to discuss the tournament[^42].

The World Cup served as what critics called a "handy public-relations veil to mask the atrocities being committed by the dictatorship"[^43]. At the end of the tournament, which Videla dubbed the "World Cup of Peace," Argentines appeared united in their outpouring of national pride, and the junta achieved the propaganda victory they sought[^44]. Videla cited the enthusiasm of Argentine fans for their victorious team as evidence of his personal and the junta's popularity[^45].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Dirty War and Forced Disappearances

Videla's regime initiated one of the most brutal campaigns of state terrorism in Latin American history. Under his leadership, the regime systematically abducted, tortured, and murdered thousands of people in what became known as Argentina's "Dirty War"[^46]. The junta systematized repression through "forced disappearances" (desaparecidos), a method that made it extremely difficult to file legal complaints since bodies were never found[^47]. Human rights activists estimate that between 13,000 and 30,000 people were disappeared or killed during the dictatorship[^48][^49].

In late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup[^50]. The Asamblea por los Derechos Humanos (Assembly for Human Rights) believes that 12,261 people were killed or disappeared during the "National Reorganization Process"[^51]. Hundreds of persons suspected of being left-wing guerrillas were arrested by the military and its right-wing allies in the last week of March 1976 alone, and thousands more "disappeared" over the next few years, apparently murdered[^52].

Victims included not just armed guerrillas but also students, teachers, journalists, trade unionists, psychologists, and anyone perceived as "subversive"[^53]. In a Casa Rosada press conference in 1979, Videla infamously stated: "The disappeared are an incognita... as long as they remain disappeared, they can't have special treatment, for they are disappeared; they've no entity, they're neither dead nor alive, they're disappeared: we can't do anything about it"[^54]. He had earlier declared in 1975: "As many people as necessary must die in Argentina so that the country will again be secure"[^55].

### Torture and Detention Centers

The regime operated hundreds of clandestine detention centers across Argentina where prisoners were subjected to systematic torture. ESMA (Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada - Navy Mechanics School), located just 700 meters from the Monumental Stadium where World Cup matches were played, was the largest detention center[^56][^57]. Almost 5,000 people were abducted and held at ESMA between 1976 and 1983; all except 150 were killed during or after interrogation and torture[^58].

Detainees were subjected to vicious forms of torture, including beatings, electric shocks, prolonged submersion in foul water, forced denial of sleep, extreme temperature and noise, attacks by trained dogs, simulated executions, and sexual torture and humiliation[^59]. Other documented methods included cigarette burns, sexual abuse, rape, removal of teeth and fingernails, castration, and burning with boiling water, oil, and acid[^60]. Between 1976 and 1983, the dictatorship murdered and "disappeared" some 30,000 Argentine workers, socialist militants, teachers, students and others perceived as "subversives," while torturing at least 100,000 others[^61].

Prisoners were often killed in "death flights": they were taken to the basement of ESMA or other centers, sedated, and then flown over the Atlantic Ocean or the Río de la Plata and pushed out of aircraft to their deaths[^62].

### Systematic Baby Theft

One of the regime's most heinous crimes was the systematic theft of babies born to women detained in the clandestine prison system. An estimated 400-500 babies were stolen during this period, often from mothers who gave birth in prison and were later "disappeared"[^63]. The infants were given to military families for illegal adoption, and their identities were hidden[^64]. The case became known as "The Systematic Plan" and involved the theft and illegal adoption of babies from political prisoners who were then summarily executed[^65].

Videla was convicted of the theft of many babies born during the captivity of their mothers at illegal detention centers and passing them on for illegal adoption by associates of the regime[^66]. On July 5, 2012, he was sentenced to 50 years in civilian prison for systematic kidnapping of children during his tenure[^67]. During the trial, Videla claimed children may have been kidnapped, but he denied there was any order or systematic plan—a claim the court rejected[^68]. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo dedicated themselves to finding the stolen children, and by June 2019, 130 of the adoptees had their identities restored[^69].

### Economic Mismanagement

While Videla's economic policies achieved some short-term gains, they also created long-term problems for Argentina. The foreign debt increased dramatically during his administration, growing from $7 billion to more than $40 billion—multiplying almost six times in seven years[^70]. During Martínez de Hoz's tenure, the foreign debt increased fourfold, and disparities between the upper and lower classes became much more pronounced[^71].

The regime's economic policies included freezing wages by law while inflation remained well above 100% throughout Martínez de Hoz's tenure, causing a devastating drop in the cost of labor with real salaries declining some 40% by 1980[^72]. The aggressive neoliberal shock therapy involved smashing trade barriers, allowing US and European products to flood Argentina's market, and removing subsidies including on gasoline[^73]. These policies benefited financial elites and foreign creditors while devastating Argentina's industrial base and working class.

### Operation Condor

Videla's rule coincided with Operation Condor, a coordinated campaign of political repression and state terror involving intelligence operations and assassination of opponents by right-wing South American dictatorships[^74]. After Chile, whose leaders had been the masterminds behind the creation of Operation Condor in late 1975, Argentina under Videla acquired a leading role in shouldering the costs of regional collaboration and working for its expansion[^75]. In late November 1975, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay formalized this collaboration by establishing a coordinated scheme to jointly harass political exiles, which they called the "Condor System"[^76].

Videla articulated the ideological basis for this transnational repression: "A terrorist is not just someone with a gun or a bomb, but also someone who spreads ideas that are contrary to Western or Christian civilization"[^77]. He also stated: "We consider it a great crime to work against the Western and Christian style of life: it is not just the bomber but the ideologist who is the danger"[^78]. Jorge Rafael Videla was among the defendants in the Operation Condor trial, though he died before its conclusion[^79].

### Catholic Church Complicity

Videla revealed in interviews conducted in 2010 that he had "many conversations" with Argentina's primate, Cardinal Raúl Francisco Primatesta, about his regime's dirty war, as well as conversations with other leading bishops from Argentina's episcopal conference and the papal nuncio Pio Laghi[^80]. "They advised us about the manner in which to deal with the situation," Videla stated[^81].

In contrast to Brazil's Catholic hierarchy, which denounced that country's military dictatorship, Argentine bishops were prominent defenders of the Videla regime against accusations of human rights abuses from abroad[^82]. On the day of the coup, military leaders met with the bishops' conference, after which Archbishop Adolfo Tortolo counseled Argentinians "to cooperate in a positive way with the new government"[^83]. Cardinal Primatesta refused to meet with mothers of the disappeared who were seeking help in finding their missing loved ones[^84]. Military chaplains were assigned as spiritual advisers to junior officers who staffed detention centers[^85].

## Personal Life

Jorge Rafael Videla married Alicia Raquel Hartridge on April 7, 1948[^86]. Alicia was born on September 28, 1927, and died on November 5, 2021. She was the daughter of Samuel Alejandro Hartridge Parkes, an English Argentine professor of physics and Argentine ambassador to Turkey, and María Isabel Lacoste Álvarez[^87].

The couple had seven children: María Cristina (born 1949), Jorge Horacio (born 1950), Alejandro Eugenio (1951–1971), María Isabel (born 1954), Pedro Ignacio (born 1956), Fernando Gabriel (born 1961), and Rafael Patricio (born 1963)[^88]. Two of his sons, Rafael Patricio and Fernando Gabriel, followed in their father's footsteps and joined the Argentine Army[^89].

Those who knew Videla described him as a courteous, soft-spoken man with impeccable manners—a stark contrast to the brutal policies he implemented[^90]. He cultivated an image of moderation and reluctance, claiming to be a man thrust into political leadership by necessity rather than ambition[^91]. This carefully constructed persona helped him maintain support among conservative civilians who saw him as a bulwark against chaos and communism.

## Legacy

Jorge Rafael Videla's legacy is one of the darkest in Argentine history. José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, stated upon Videla's death: "Videla will be remembered as the man who headed the cruelest dictatorship in Argentine history"[^92]. His rule during the time of Operation Condor was among the most infamous in Latin America during the Cold War due to its high level of human rights abuses including abductions, torture, executions, and systematic kidnapping of children, as well as severe economic mismanagement[^93].

The Dirty War left deep scars on Argentine society. An estimated 30,000 people were murdered or disappeared before the dictatorship ended in 1983[^94]. The regime's systematic use of forced disappearances, torture, and clandestine detention centers set a horrific precedent in state terrorism. The stolen children—many of whom only learned their true identities decades later through the work of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo—represent one of the most tragic dimensions of Videla's legacy[^95].

Economically, Videla's neoliberal policies contributed to Argentina's long-term debt crisis. The foreign debt that grew from $7 billion to over $40 billion during his administration burdened Argentina for decades[^96]. The destruction of Argentine industry through rapid trade liberalization and the massive redistribution of wealth upward created economic distortions that persisted long after the dictatorship ended[^97].

However, Videla's legacy also includes an important chapter in the global fight against impunity. Argentina became a pioneer in prosecuting former dictators for crimes against humanity. Mariela Belski, executive director of Amnesty International in Argentina, emphasized that "justice was done, Videla was convicted, and he died in prison," noting that Argentina "took a major stride forward in bringing these crimes to trial"[^98]. Víctor Abramovich, executive secretary of the Institute of Public Policies on Human Rights, called Videla's death in prison "a very important symbolic development"[^99].

The Mothers of Plaza de Mayo, who began demonstrating in the Plaza de Mayo on April 30, 1977, became an international symbol of resistance to dictatorship and the fight for human rights[^100]. Their white headscarves and weekly marches demanding information about their disappeared children challenged the regime and kept the memory of victims alive[^101]. After the regime violently targeted the Mothers—kidnapping, torturing, and murdering founder Azucena Villaflor De Vincenti in December 1977 after she listed names of "the missing" in a newspaper—the movement only grew stronger[^102].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Very few scholars or historians offer positive assessments of Videla's rule, and those who do focus narrowly on specific aspects rather than endorsing his regime overall. Some supporters have maintained that Videla only reluctantly became involved in politics and that his relatively moderate policies were increasingly undercut by right-wing military hard-liners who operated with almost complete independence, carrying out repressive measures as they saw fit[^103]. This view portrays Videla as a restraining influence on worse elements within the military—a claim that most historians reject as unsupported by evidence.

Some conservative Argentines, particularly those who benefited economically from his policies or who feared left-wing guerrillas in the 1970s, initially welcomed the coup and believed Videla saved Argentina from communist takeover and civil war[^104]. They point to the defeat of armed guerrilla movements as a necessary achievement, regardless of the methods used[^105]. The U.S. State Department saw Argentina as a bulwark of anti-communism in South America, and in early April 1976, the U.S. Congress approved a request by the Ford Administration, written by Henry Kissinger, to grant $50 million in security assistance to the junta[^106].

Some defenders claim the economic reforms, despite their harsh impact, modernized Argentina's economy and broke the power of inefficient state-run industries[^107]. They argue that Martínez de Hoz's policies, while painful, were necessary medicine for Argentina's economic crisis[^108].

Videla himself wrote an open letter to the military after receiving a pardon, saying his only crime was to defend the nation[^109]. On July 5, 2010, he took full responsibility for his army's actions during his rule, stating: "I take full military responsibility for the actions of the army in the war against terrorism"[^110].

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among historians, human rights organizations, and international bodies is profoundly critical of Videla's dictatorship. The systematic nature of the human rights abuses—the forced disappearances, torture, murder, and baby theft—places Videla's regime among the worst violators of human rights in the twentieth century[^111].

Scholars emphasize that the regime's violence far exceeded what was necessary to defeat armed guerrillas. By the time Videla seized power in 1976, the guerrilla movements were already weakened and numbered only a few thousand fighters[^112]. The tens of thousands who were disappeared included vast numbers of civilians with no connection to armed groups: students, trade unionists, psychologists, journalists, nuns, and even teenagers whose only "crime" was being related to someone the regime considered subversive[^113].

Videla's infamous statement that "I do not consider Argentine" those targeted by repression reveals the regime's ideological extremism and willingness to dehumanize victims: "I want to clarify that Argentine citizens are not victims of the repression. The repression is against a minority that we do not consider Argentine"[^114]. His chilling explanation of the disappearances shows premeditation and systematic planning: "Let's say there were 7,000 or 8,000 people who had to die to win the war against subversion... We couldn't execute them by firing squad. Neither could we take them to court... For that reason, so as not to provoke protests inside and outside the country, the decision was reached that these people should be disappeared"[^115].

Human rights organizations across the political spectrum denounced Videla, noting that he died without admitting awareness of the disappeared persons and kidnapped children, taking secrets about many victims to his grave[^116]. Nora Cortiñas, whose son Carlos "disappeared" in 1977, said: "I do not celebrate his death, because they die and they take with them the most important secrets in history"[^117].

The trial and conviction of Videla and other commanders provided a catharsis for many Argentines and demonstrated that no government is above the law[^118]. However, many felt the verdicts were insufficient justice given the scale of the crimes[^119]. The regime's economic policies are now widely viewed as having benefited financial elites while devastating the working class and leaving Argentina with crippling debt[^120].
