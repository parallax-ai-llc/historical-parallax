## Summary

King Muryeong (461-523 CE) was the 25th monarch of Baekje, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, reigning from 501 to 523 CE.[^1] Born on the Japanese island of Kakara during a diplomatic mission, he ascended to power following his father King Dongseong's assassination and immediately consolidated his authority by crushing aristocratic rebellions.[^2] His 22-year reign marked a golden age of Baekje culture, characterized by military victories against Goguryeo, diplomatic expansion with China's Liang Dynasty and Japan, territorial conquests including Tamna (Jeju Island), and unprecedented economic prosperity.[^3] The 1971 discovery of his intact tomb, containing over 4,600 artifacts including magnificent gold crown ornaments, revolutionized understanding of Baekje civilization and remains one of the most significant archaeological finds in Korean history.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

According to the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan), King Muryeong was born under extraordinary circumstances in 461 CE when his father's brother, Buyeo Gonji, was traveling to Japan as an envoy of King Gaero.[^5] Gonji's pregnant wife went into labor during the sea voyage, forcing them to anchor at Kakara Island (also called Kakashima) in what is now northern Saga Prefecture, Japan.[^6] The child was born on this small island, earning him the name "Semakishi" or "King Shima" in Japanese records—both names deriving from the word for "island."[^7] The Baekje people called the birthplace "Nirimu Sema," meaning "main island."[^8]

King Muryeong's unusual birth story became part of the mythological narrative surrounding his legitimacy and connection to both Korea and Japan.[^9] He was the second son of King Dongseong, the 24th ruler of Baekje.[^10] Little is recorded about his childhood or early education, though as a member of the Buyeo royal family, he would have received training in Confucian classics, military strategy, and statecraft.[^11]

The circumstances of his birth on Japanese soil would later prove significant in establishing diplomatic relations between Baekje and the Yamato court.[^12] His early years coincided with a period of instability in Baekje, as the kingdom struggled to recover from the devastating loss of its capital Hansong to Goguryeo in 475 CE, an event that had forced the kingdom to relocate to Ungjin (modern-day Gongju).[^13] This traumatic relocation, which occurred when Muryeong was approximately 14 years old, shaped the political landscape he would inherit.[^14]

Growing up in the shadow of Baekje's humiliation by Goguryeo and the subsequent move to a less strategic capital, the young prince would have been acutely aware of the kingdom's vulnerability and the need for strong leadership.[^15] The factional politics among aristocratic clans—particularly the traditionally powerful Hae and Jin clans and the rising influence of local Ungjin nobility—created a volatile political environment that would explode into violence at the end of his father's reign.[^16]

---

## Rise to Power

King Muryeong's ascension to the throne in 501 CE was precipitated by violence and political intrigue.[^17] His father, King Dongseong, was assassinated while hunting by forces loyal to Baekga, a powerful court official whom Dongseong had exiled to the remote Karim Fortress in an attempt to curtail the growing power of local aristocratic clans.[^18] The assassination reflected the deep tensions between the monarchy and powerful noble families who had gained influence following the kingdom's relocation to Ungjin.[^19]

The circumstances surrounding Dongseong's death remain somewhat controversial among historians.[^20] While the Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms) attributes the assassination directly to Baekga, Japan's Nihon Shoki presents a different narrative, suggesting that "people of Baekje had got rid of him and had Muryeong to replace him because King Dongseong did not accomplish the way of King."[^21] This alternative account raises questions about whether Baekga acted alone or was part of a broader aristocratic conspiracy, possibly with Muryeong's knowledge or even involvement.[^22]

What is certain is that Muryeong moved swiftly and decisively upon assuming the throne.[^23] In 502 CE, just one year after becoming king, he crushed a planned rebellion by Baekga with overwhelming force.[^24] Historical records note that Baekga offered no resistance when the royal army came to execute him, leading some scholars to speculate that he may have been a scapegoat for broader political upheaval rather than the primary conspirator.[^25] Regardless of Baekga's true role, his elimination served Muryeong's purposes perfectly, allowing the new king to demonstrate strength while eliminating a potential rival.[^26]

Following the suppression of the revolt, Muryeong implemented comprehensive administrative reforms designed to prevent future aristocratic challenges to royal authority.[^27] He reorganized Baekje's system of local rule to facilitate more effective central oversight, sending members of the royal family to 22 regional areas across the kingdom to ensure direct royal control over provincial territories.[^28] This restructuring strengthened governance at the provincial level, reducing vulnerabilities to local power brokers and enabling firmer royal control over the kingdom's territories.[^29]

These early decisive actions established Muryeong's reputation as a strong and capable ruler who would tolerate no challenges to his authority.[^30] By combining military force with administrative innovation, he successfully consolidated power in a way that would enable Baekje to enter its most prosperous period.[^31]

## Major Achievements

### Military Victories and Territorial Expansion

King Muryeong's reign was marked by sustained military success against Baekje's primary rival, Goguryeo.[^32] In 501, immediately upon taking the throne, he dispatched an army to attack Goguryeo's Sugok-seong fortress, signaling his aggressive stance toward the northern kingdom.[^33] In 503, he successfully repelled an attack by the Mohe, a Tungusic people allied with Goguryeo who inhabited ancient Manchuria.[^34] He repeated this defensive success in 507, again defeating combined Goguryeo and Mohe forces.[^35]

The most dramatic military engagement occurred in 512 when Goguryeo forces conquered two Baekje castles.[^36] Rather than accept this loss, King Muryeong personally led 3,000 men into battle and destroyed the Goguryeo army, reclaiming the lost territories.[^37] This personal leadership in combat enhanced his prestige and demonstrated the martial valor expected of Baekje monarchs.[^38] In 523, recognizing the ongoing threat from the north, he ordered the construction of a fortified wall to defend Baekje's northern border, a massive infrastructure project that would protect the kingdom for decades.[^39]

Beyond defensive operations, Muryeong successfully expanded Baekje's territory by conquering the state of Tamna, based on Jeju Island, and annexing parts of the Gaya confederacy in southern Korea.[^40] The conquest of Tamna was particularly significant as it gave Baekje control over strategic maritime routes and expanded the kingdom's influence into island territories.[^41] These military achievements were facilitated by Baekje's alliance with Silla, formed in 433 CE, which allowed both kingdoms to counter Goguryeo's power and created the relatively stable century during which Baekje enjoyed its greatest prosperity.[^42]

### Diplomatic Excellence

King Muryeong's diplomatic accomplishments rivaled his military successes.[^43] He established formal diplomatic ties with China's newly founded Liang Dynasty, sending his first mission in 512 CE.[^44] This was followed by a second mission in 521 to announce various victories over Goguryeo.[^45] In response, the Liang emperor bestowed prestigious titles on Muryeong, including "Great General Tranquilizing the East" (寧東大將軍) and "King of Baekje"—titles that were later found engraved on tablets in his tomb, providing archaeological confirmation of these diplomatic exchanges.[^46]

These diplomatic relationships with China brought substantial benefits to Baekje.[^47] According to both historical and archaeological sources, contact and trade between China and Baekje increased dramatically during Muryeong's reign.[^48] The exchange included not only commercial goods but also cultural and technological knowledge that enhanced Baekje's civilization.[^49] The relationship ensured that Baekje was recognized not merely as a regional power but as a key player on the continental stage of Northeast Asian politics.[^50]

Muryeong's diplomatic engagement with Japan was equally significant.[^51] In 503, he sent a bronze mirror to the Yamato court, and in 513 and 516, he dispatched Confucian scholars including Managuen and Sahaguen to Japan.[^52] These missions involved sending specialists such as monks and scholars, Buddhist goods, various books, and medicines, while Japan regularly provided thousands of soldiers, hundreds of horses, and scores of ships in return.[^53] This mutually beneficial relationship saw Baekje provide economic, cultural, and technological aid in exchange for military and political support.[^54]

The cultural impact of these exchanges was profound and lasting.[^55] Muryeong's son, King Seong, would later send a mission to Japan in 538 that brought an image of Shakyamuni Buddha and several sutras to the Japanese court—an event traditionally considered the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan.[^56] The connections established during Muryeong's reign laid the foundation for centuries of cultural transmission from Korea to Japan.[^57]

### Administrative and Economic Reforms

Muryeong's governance extended beyond military and diplomatic affairs to encompass significant domestic reforms.[^58] He implemented policies that allowed wanderers to return to their homelands and devote themselves to agriculture, contributing to increased agricultural production and stability in the lives of farming households.[^59] This focus on agricultural development strengthened the economic foundation of the kingdom and improved the welfare of common people.[^60]

His administrative restructuring involved promoting a system that emphasized local governance while maintaining strong central control.[^61] By engaging communities actively in decision-making processes while ensuring royal oversight through appointed family members, he created a balanced system that prevented both aristocratic dominance and excessive centralization.[^62] These reforms laid a solid foundation for the prosperity that characterized his reign and enabled the cultural flowering that would continue under his successors.[^63]

### Religious and Cultural Patronage

King Muryeong gave unwavering support to Buddhism, endorsing Buddhist practices and the construction of temples, allowing the religion to take deep root within Baekje society.[^64] His efforts to construct temples and promote Buddhist teachings left an enduring spiritual legacy that remains evident in contemporary Korean culture.[^65] While it would not be until 528 that his son King Seong officially established Buddhism as the state religion, Muryeong's reign created the conditions for this religious transformation.[^66]

The cultural achievements of his era are evidenced by artifacts such as the splendid gilt-bronze incense burner excavated from the ancient Buddhist temple site at Neungsan-ri, which exemplifies the artistic excellence of Baekje craftsmanship.[^67] Baekje visual arts during this period reveal technical maturity along with warm human qualities, sometimes attributed to the influence of southern Chinese art from the Six Dynasties period, particularly evident in softly modeled Buddha statues with their distinctive and expressive "Baekje smile."[^68]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Archaeological Disaster of 1971

The most significant controversy surrounding King Muryeong concerns not his reign but the 1971 excavation of his tomb, which is widely criticized as one of the worst archaeological disasters in Korean history.[^69] The tomb was accidentally discovered during water drainage work on nearby tombs, and what should have been a careful, methodical excavation lasting several years was instead completed in just 17 hours—essentially one night.[^70]

Dr. Kim Won-ryong of Seoul National University, who directed the excavation, later stated in his memoir: "The excavation of King Muryeong's tomb was the biggest shame and mistake of my life."[^71] Testimonies indicate that relics were thrown into sacks indiscriminately, and field records documenting the arrangement of artifacts were completely destroyed.[^72] The rushed excavation report published in 1973 contained numerous errors and omitted crucial archaeological data that could never be recovered.[^73]

The excavation is thus considered both the best and worst in Korean archaeology—best because the intact tomb provided unprecedented insights into Baekje civilization, worst because the careless methodology destroyed irreplaceable archaeological context and data.[^74] The problems that arose during the excavation and the subsequent self-critical reflection within the archaeological community brought about key developments in Korean archaeology and South Korean cultural heritage policies, ultimately paving the way for the systematic excavations of Silla and Gaya royal tombs that followed.[^75]

### Questions of Legitimacy and Succession

Historical controversies exist regarding Muryeong's rise to power.[^76] The discrepancy between Korean and Japanese historical records about King Dongseong's death has led some scholars to question whether Muryeong was complicit in his father's assassination or whether he benefited from a broader aristocratic conspiracy.[^77] The fact that Baekga offered no resistance to execution has fueled speculation that he may have been a scapegoat rather than the actual mastermind of Dongseong's murder.[^78]

These questions are impossible to resolve definitively given the limited and politically motivated nature of surviving historical sources.[^79] The Samguk Sagi, which provides much of our information about Muryeong, was written from a Silla perspective reflecting the violent conflicts between Silla and Baekje in the 6th and 7th centuries, potentially biasing its portrayal of Baekje rulers.[^80]

### Scholarly Debates on Artifacts and Identity

The interpretation of artifacts from Muryeong's tomb has sparked ongoing scholarly debates.[^81] The design of the king's crown ornaments is particularly controversial, with disagreements about whether these items were worn during life or reserved exclusively for burial rites.[^82] Similar controversies involve artifact functionality and tomb symbolism more broadly.[^83]

Linguistic controversies surround Muryeong's name "Sama" (斯麻).[^84] The general scholarly consensus holds that this name originated from "Sema," meaning island in the Baekje language, referring to his birthplace.[^85] However, some have attempted to link it to the Japanese honorific suffix "sama" (様), a hypothesis that most scholars reject as grammatically and historically weak.[^86]

### Military Limitations

Despite his military successes, Muryeong's reign did not fundamentally alter the strategic balance of power on the Korean peninsula.[^87] While he successfully defended Baekje against Goguryeo and even scored significant victories, he was unable to recover the Han River valley that had been lost in 475 CE—a loss that continued to weaken Baekje's strategic position.[^88] The kingdom remained vulnerable to Goguryeo pressure, necessitating continued alliance with Silla, an arrangement that would ultimately prove fatal when Silla betrayed Baekje in 550 CE, two decades after Muryeong's death.[^89]

## Personal Life

King Muryeong was buried alongside his queen in the tomb discovered in 1971 in Songsan-ri, Gongju, South Korea.[^90] According to inscriptions found on stone epitaph plaques in the tomb, the queen died in December 526, three years after Muryeong's death, and was interred on February 12, 529.[^91] Remarkably, despite the wealth of artifacts discovered in their tomb, the queen's name was not recorded on any inscription, a mystery that has puzzled historians.[^92] The plaques identify her only as "King of King Baekje," suggesting her elevated status but leaving her personal identity unknown.[^93]

The king and queen's tomb contained elaborate burial goods that speak to their elevated status and the sophistication of Baekje culture.[^94] Both were provided with gold crown ornaments, though the designs differed—the queen's crown featured symmetrically arranged lotus, palmette, and "dangling bottle" motifs, while the king's ornaments employed a dynamic flame motif.[^95] Analysis revealed these were made of 98-99.1% pure gold, created through hammering, cutting, and hanging golden spangles.[^96] Both royal personages were provided with gilded bronze shoes, elaborate jewelry including earrings, necklaces, and bracelets with inscribed characters, along with jade objects, glass beads, and other precious items.[^97]

King Muryeong had at least two sons who left significant historical legacies.[^98] His first son became King Seong of Baekje (r. 523-554), the 26th monarch, who before ascending the throne was known as Buyeo Myeong or Buyeo Myeongnong.[^99] King Seong would continue and expand his father's policies, moving the capital to Sabi in 538 and officially establishing Buddhism as Baekje's state religion in 528.[^100] He would also send the mission to Japan in 538 that formally introduced Buddhism to the Yamato court.[^101]

Muryeong's second son, Prince Junda (known in Baekje as Buyeo Junta), took a different path.[^102] He settled in Japan and became an ancestor of Japanese noble lineages.[^103] According to the Shoku Nihongi, Emperor Kanmu's mother, Takano no Niigasa (720-790 CE), was a descendant of Prince Junda.[^104] This connection created a direct blood link between the Baekje royal family and the Japanese imperial line that continues to the present day.[^105]

Historical records also mention a child named Saa-gun, though details about this individual remain scarce.[^106]

King Muryeong's personality can be inferred from his actions rather than direct descriptions.[^107] His decisive suppression of Baekga's rebellion, his personal leadership in the 512 campaign against Goguryeo, and his comprehensive administrative reforms all suggest a ruler who combined martial prowess with strategic vision and political acumen.[^108] His successful balancing of relationships with China, Japan, and Silla demonstrates sophisticated diplomatic skill.[^109] His support for Buddhism and cultural development indicates an appreciation for religion and the arts beyond mere military matters.[^110]

The tomb inscriptions record that King Muryeong died on June 6, 523 CE, at the age of 62 (by traditional East Asian counting methods).[^111] His burial in an elaborate brick chamber tomb modeled on Chinese architectural styles of the period reflected Baekje's cultural connections to the continent.[^112] The tomb measured 4.2 meters north-south, 2.72 meters east-west, and 3.14 meters in height, constructed of black brick with a vaulted ceiling.[^113]

## Legacy

### Archaeological and Historical Impact

The 1971 discovery of King Muryeong's tomb revolutionized understanding of Baekje civilization and Korean history more broadly.[^114] As the only Baekje royal tomb discovered intact, it provided unprecedented insights into royal burial practices, artistic achievements, and international connections of the kingdom.[^115] The approximately 4,600 artifacts recovered from the tomb, with 17 designated as National Treasures of Korea, constitute the most important collection of Baekje material culture in existence.[^116]

The tomb's discovery unveiled crucial insights into Baekje's past and rejuvenated academic research, revealing the kingdom's historical importance and craft excellence.[^117] Advanced science, technology, and ideology documented through tomb artifacts demonstrated that cultural exchange rather than warfare characterized relationships between China, the Korean Peninsula, and the Japanese Archipelago, playing an important role in enhancing the overall cultural level of Northeast Asia.[^118] The internationalism and creative adoption of foreign cultures evidenced in the metalwork and other artifacts revealed Baekje's sophisticated engagement with continental and maritime networks.[^119]

In 2015, the Songsan-ri Burial Ground, where the Tomb of King Muryeong is located, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Baekje Historic Areas.[^120] The artifacts from the tomb played a key role in this successful designation, through which the historic importance, creativity, and cultural significance of Baekje sites came to be acknowledged internationally.[^121]

### Cultural and Religious Endurance

King Muryeong's support for Buddhism created lasting spiritual legacies that remain evident in contemporary Korean culture.[^122] His efforts to construct temples and promote Buddhist teachings, continued and expanded by his son King Seong, established Buddhism as a defining feature of Korean civilization.[^123] The transmission of Buddhist culture from Baekje to Japan, facilitated by relationships Muryeong established, profoundly influenced Japanese religious and artistic development.[^124]

The sophisticated cultural production of Muryeong's reign, exemplified by the famous "Baekje smile" in Buddhist sculpture and elaborate metalwork, set artistic standards that influenced Korean aesthetics for centuries.[^125] His fostering of an environment that encouraged trade, commerce, and cultural exchanges facilitated the spread of advanced civilization throughout Northeast Asia.[^126]

### International Connections

King Muryeong's legacy extends directly into modern international relations through his documented connection to the Japanese imperial family.[^127] On December 23, 2001, Emperor Akihito of Japan publicly acknowledged this ancestry, stating: "I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea, given that it is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was one of the descendant of King Muryong of Baekje."[^128] This was the first time a Japanese emperor publicly referred to Korean blood in the imperial line, and the statement was made during a period of tensions between Japan and South Korea.[^129]

Since Emperor Akihito is a direct descendant of Emperor Kanmu through the unbroken imperial line, and Kanmu's mother Takano no Niigasa descended from Muryeong's son Prince Junda, this creates a verifiable genealogical link between modern Japan's imperial family and the ancient Baekje kingdom.[^130] This connection serves as a powerful reminder of the deep historical ties between Korea and Japan, predating modern political divisions.[^131]

### Modern Korean Identity

Understanding King Muryeong's contributions inspires modern Koreans to cherish their rich heritage while recognizing the importance of their interconnectedness with the broader world.[^132] Modern interpretations of his reign not only reflect evolving societal values but also serve to engage younger audiences with the rich history of the Baekje Dynasty.[^133] His successful balancing of military strength, diplomatic finesse, cultural patronage, and administrative innovation provides a historical model of effective leadership.[^134]

King Muryeong's reign represents a golden age in Baekje's history—a period when the kingdom recovered from earlier disasters, expanded its power and influence, and created a cultural flowering that would influence all of Northeast Asia.[^135] His legacy thus continues to influence Korean culture through Buddhism, international cultural exchange, archaeological practices, and national heritage preservation.[^136]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship generally regards King Muryeong as one of Baekje's most successful and important rulers.[^137] Historians praise his decisive handling of the political crisis that brought him to power, noting that his swift elimination of aristocratic threats prevented the kind of political fragmentation that had weakened the kingdom in previous decades.[^138] His administrative reforms, which strengthened central control while engaging local communities, are viewed as innovative solutions to the challenges of governing a kingdom recovering from military disaster and capital relocation.[^139]

Military historians commend Muryeong's strategic acumen, particularly his personal leadership in the 512 campaign that destroyed the Goguryeo army.[^140] His construction of border fortifications and successful defense against multiple Goguryeo attacks are seen as critical to maintaining Baekje's independence during a period when Goguryeo was at the height of its power.[^141] The conquest of Tamna and expansion into Gaya territories demonstrated an ability to seize offensive opportunities while maintaining defensive stability.[^142]

Scholars of international relations highlight Muryeong's sophisticated diplomacy as perhaps his greatest achievement.[^143] His establishment of formal ties with China's Liang Dynasty and his cultivation of productive relationships with Japan created a strategic environment favorable to Baekje's interests.[^144] The exchange of cultural, technological, and religious knowledge facilitated by these diplomatic connections enriched Baekje civilization and positioned the kingdom as a cultural bridge between China and Japan.[^145]

Cultural historians emphasize Muryeong's support for Buddhism and patronage of the arts as creating the foundation for Baekje's cultural golden age.[^146] The artistic achievements evident in artifacts from his tomb, particularly the exquisite gold crown ornaments and refined metalwork, demonstrate the high level of craftsmanship achieved during his reign.[^147] His policies fostered an environment of cultural creativity and international exchange that would influence Korean and Japanese culture for centuries.[^148]

The archaeological community, despite criticizing the 1971 excavation methods, acknowledges that the discovery of Muryeong's intact tomb has been invaluable for understanding Baekje civilization.[^149] The tomb provides concrete evidence of international connections documented in historical texts, confirming the accuracy of records about diplomatic exchanges with China and Japan.[^150] The artifacts have enabled scholars to understand Baekje artistic styles, metalworking techniques, religious practices, and social organization in unprecedented detail.[^151]

### Negative Views

Critical historians point to several limitations and failures in Muryeong's reign.[^152] Most significantly, he was unable to recover the strategically vital Han River valley that Baekje had lost to Goguryeo in 475 CE.[^153] This failure meant that Baekje remained in a fundamentally weakened strategic position throughout his reign, dependent on alliance with Silla and unable to achieve the kind of territorial restoration that might have altered the balance of power on the Korean peninsula.[^154]

Some scholars question the long-term sustainability of Muryeong's diplomatic achievements.[^155] While his relationships with China and Japan brought immediate benefits, they also created dependencies that could become vulnerabilities if those relationships soured.[^156] The reliance on Silla as an ally against Goguryeo, while necessary given the strategic situation, ultimately proved disastrous when Silla betrayed Baekje in 550 CE—though this occurred after Muryeong's death, critics argue he should have anticipated the potential for such betrayal and developed alternative strategies.[^157]

Questions about the legitimacy of Muryeong's accession continue to trouble some historians.[^158] The discrepancies between Korean and Japanese accounts of King Dongseong's death, and the suspiciously convenient elimination of Baekga who conveniently did not resist execution, suggest possible complicity or manipulation that the historical record obscures.[^159] If Muryeong was involved in or aware of a conspiracy to assassinate his father, this would cast a shadow over his otherwise successful reign.[^160]

Archaeological critics focus not on Muryeong himself but on the catastrophic handling of his tomb's excavation.[^161] While this is not a criticism of the historical figure, it represents a tragic loss of historical knowledge about his reign, burial practices, and the material culture of his era.[^162] The destruction of archaeological context and the careless handling of artifacts means that many questions about Baekje civilization that the tomb might have answered can never be resolved.[^163]

Some revisionist historians argue that Muryeong's reign, while stable and prosperous, was essentially defensive and conservative rather than transformative.[^164] He successfully maintained Baekje's position but did not fundamentally alter the strategic situation or achieve the kind of dramatic expansion that characterized the reigns of Goguryeo's Gwanggaeto or Silla's later rulers.[^165] From this perspective, Muryeong was a competent manager of decline rather than a visionary who could reverse Baekje's long-term trajectory toward eventual destruction in 660 CE.[^166]

## Famous Quotes

Unfortunately, no direct quotations from King Muryeong have survived in historical records.[^167] The primary sources for his reign—the Samguk Sagi (History of the Three Kingdoms) and the Nihon Shoki (Chronicles of Japan)—record his actions and policies but do not preserve his spoken or written words.[^168] Most knowledge about Muryeong comes from archaeological discoveries rather than textual records containing his statements.[^169]

However, the inscriptions found in his tomb, while not quotes from the king himself, provide valuable contemporaneous text:

> "Great General Tranquilizing the East, King of Baekje" - Title bestowed by Liang Dynasty Emperor, inscribed on tomb tablet[^170]

This title reflects both Chinese recognition of Muryeong's authority and Baekje's position within the Northeast Asian diplomatic order.[^171]

> "The King passed away in 523, at the age of sixty-two" - Stone epitaph plaque from tomb[^172]

This inscription provides precise dating that has been crucial for establishing the chronology of Baekje history.[^173]

While not direct quotes, later historical assessments capture scholarly views of his reign:

> "The excavation of King Muryeong's tomb was the biggest shame and mistake of my life." - Dr. Kim Won-ryong, archaeological excavation director[^174]

This quote, while about the tomb rather than the king, speaks to the immense historical significance of Muryeong's burial site and the tragedy of its mishandled excavation.[^175]

> "I, on my part, feel a certain kinship with Korea, given that it is recorded in the Chronicles of Japan that the mother of Emperor Kanmu was one of the descendant of King Muryong of Baekje." - Emperor Akihito of Japan, December 23, 2001[^176]

This modern statement by Emperor Akihito acknowledges the enduring legacy of King Muryeong's bloodline connection to the Japanese imperial family.[^177]
