## Overview

D-Day (June 6, 1944) was the largest amphibious invasion in military history. Codenamed **Operation Overlord**, it marked the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi control. An Allied armada of 6,939 vessels landed 156,000 US, British, and Canadian troops on five beaches along a 50-mile stretch of the Normandy coast. Preceded by a massive airborne drop, the assault breached Hitler's "Atlantic Wall." Despite heavy casualties (especially at Omaha Beach), the Allies secured a foothold, opening the Second Front that Stalin had demanded, and beginning the race to Berlin.

## The Atlantic Wall

Hitler appointed **Field Marshal Erwin Rommel** to defend the coast.
Rommel knew the invasion must be stopped on the beaches ("The first 24 hours will be decisive").
**Defenses:**
- 6 million mines.
- "Rommel's Asparagus" (wooden stakes to impale gliders).
- Concrete bunkers (Tobouks).
- Underwater obstacles to rip boat hulls.

## The Deception (Operation Fortitude)

The Allies convinced Hitler the invasion would land at **Pas de Calais** (the shortest distance from England).
- **FUSAG:** A fake army commanded by General Patton (inflatable tanks, wooden planes).
- **Double Agents:** Juan Pujol García ("Garbo") fed Germans fake intel.
**Result:** Hitler kept his best Panzer divisions at Calais, far from Normandy, even days after D-Day began.

## Order of Battle

### Supreme Allied Commander: Dwight D. Eisenhower

**The Plan:**
1.  **Airborne (Midnight):** 24,000 paratroopers (US 101st/82nd, British 6th) drop behind lines to seize bridges/roads.
2.  **Naval Bombardment (Dawn):** Soften defenses.
3.  **Amphibious Landing (06:30):** 5 Beaches.

### The Beaches

| Beach | Sector | Troops | Outcome |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Utah** | Western | US 4th Infantry | **Light resistance.** (Landed 1 mile off target, fortuitously less defended). 197 casualties. |
| **Omaha** | Western | US 1st & 29th | **Bloody hell.** High bluffs, elite German 352nd Division. Tanks (DD tanks) sank. 2,000+ casualties. "Bloody Omaha." |
| **Gold** | Center | British 50th | Successful. 400 casualties. |
| **Juno** | Center | Canadian 3rd | Heavy mining/rough seas. 1,200 casualties. Broke through furthest inland. |
| **Sword** | Eastern | British 3rd | Successful link with Airborne. Faced Panzer counterattack (21st Panzer). |

## The Battle (June 6)

### 00:16 - The Drops
Scattered mess. Pilots flew too fast/high due to flak.
Troops landed miles off target.
**Unintended Benefit:** Confusion. Germans reported "paratroopers everywhere." Couldn't pinpoint main attack.

### 06:30 - H-Hour
**Omaha Beach:**
Ramps dropped. Men cut down by MG42s instantly.
General Omar Bradley considered abandoning the beach.
Small groups (Col. George Taylor: "Two kinds of people staying on this beach: the dead and those who are going to die. Now let's get the hell out of here!") rallied and scaled the bluffs.

### The German Response
Hitler was asleep. His aides refused to wake him.
Field Marshal Rundstedt requested Panzer reserves. OKW (High Command) refused until Hitler woke up (noon).
**Result:** Panzers arrived too late. Air superiority (Ally planes) decimated them on roads.

## Casualties (D-Day Only)

| Force | Landed | Killed/Wounded/Missing |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **USA** | 73,000 | ~6,603 |
| **UK** | 61,715 | ~2,700 |
| **Canada** | 21,400 | ~1,074 |
| **Germany** | Unknown | ~4,000 - 9,000 |

**French Civilians:** ~3,000 killed by Allied bombing on D-Day (Often overlooked tragedy).

## Technology

- **Higgins Boat (LCVP):** Plywood flat-bottomed boat. "The boat that won the war" (Eisenhower).
- **Mulberry Harbours:** Artificial portable harbors towed across channel.
- **DD Tanks (Donald Duck):** Swimming Sherman tanks (canvas screens). Most sank at Omaha due to high waves.
- **Hobart's Funnies:** British modified tanks (flail chains for mines, carpet layers for mud).

---

## Legacy

- **The Longest Day:** Ended the Third Reich's dominance.
- **Logistics Wonder:** By end of June, Allies landed 850,000 men and 150,000 vehicles.
- **Soviet Relief:** Took pressure off Eastern Front.
