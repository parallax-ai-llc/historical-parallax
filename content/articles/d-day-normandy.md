## Summary

D-Day (June 6, 1944) was the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France, the largest amphibious assault in history. Code-named Operation Overlord, 156,000 American, British, and Canadian troops landed on five Normandy beaches (Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword), supported by massive naval and air bombardment. Despite fierce German resistance, especially at Omaha Beach, Allies established beachhead, opening Western Front and beginning liberation of France. D-Day was turning point: Germany now fought two-front war, defeat inevitable. By day's end, 4,414 Allied soldiers were confirmed dead, with thousands more wounded, but Hitler's "Fortress Europe" was breached.

## Planning

**Supreme Commander**: General Dwight D. Eisenhower

**Objectives**:
- Establish beachhead in Normandy
- Build up forces faster than Germans can reinforce
- Break out and liberate France, Belgium, Netherlands
- Invade Germany from west

**Deception (Operation Fortitude)**:
- Convinced Germans invasion would be at Pas-de-Calais (110 miles north)
- Fake army (FUSAG) under Patton
- Dummy tanks, false radio traffic
- Germans kept reserves at Calais even after D-Day

## The Assault

**Five Beaches**:
1. **Utah** (U.S.): Easier landing, linked with airborne troops
2. **Omaha** (U.S.): Bloodiest—strong defenses, 2,000+ casualties
3. **Gold** (British): Moderate resistance
4. **Juno** (Canadian): Heavy casualties early, then success
5. **Sword** (British): Linked with airborne, pushed inland

**Airborne Drops**:
- U.S. 82nd & 101st Airborne dropped behind Utah
- British 6th Airborne secured eastern flank
- Many scattered, disorganized, but disrupted German response

**Naval Support**:
- 7,000 ships and landing craft
- 195,700 naval personnel
- Heaviest bombardment in history

**Key Moments**:
- Omaha Beach nearly failed—pinned down for hours
- Individual heroism (Rangers scaling Pointe du Hoc)
- By nightfall, foothold secured despite not meeting all objectives

## Aftermath

- Germans unable to push Allies back into sea

**Breakout**:

- August: Breakout, encirclement at Falaise
- August 25: Paris liberated
- By September: France, Belgium largely liberated

**End of War**:
Germany collapsed May 1945, less than a year after D-Day.
