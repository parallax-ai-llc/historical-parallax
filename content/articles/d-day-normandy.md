## Summary

D-Day (June 6, 1944) was the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied France—the largest amphibious military operation in history. Code-named Operation Overlord, the assault sent 156,000 American, British, Canadian, and Allied troops across the English Channel to storm five Normandy beaches (Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword). Supported by 7,000 ships and 11,000 aircraft, the invasion breached Hitler's "Atlantic Wall." Despite fierce German resistance, especially the bloodbath at Omaha Beach, the Allies established a beachhead by nightfall. D-Day opened the Western Front, leading to the liberation of France and ultimately Nazi Germany's defeat. It remains the defining moment of the Western Allies' contribution to World War II.

## Background

### Strategic Context

**Two-Front War:**
Stalin demanded "Second Front" to relieve pressure on USSR fighting Germany in the East.

**Mediterranean First:**
Churchill preferred attacking "soft underbelly" (North Africa, Sicily, Italy). By 1944, full cross-Channel invasion agreed.

**Operation Overlord:**
Code name for liberation of Western Europe. D-Day was initial assault.

**Supreme Commander:**
General Dwight D. Eisenhower (U.S.) led Allied Expeditionary Force.

## Planning

### Location

**Why Normandy:**
- Within fighter aircraft range
- Less defended than Pas-de-Calais
- Wider beaches
- Could achieve surprise

### Forces

**Allied:**
- 156,000 troops on D-Day
- 7,000 ships and landing craft
- 11,000 aircraft
- U.S., British, Canadian, Free French, Polish, and others

**German:**
- 50,000+ defenders in Normandy
- Rommel's Army Group B
- Atlantic Wall fortifications

### Deception: Operation Fortitude

**Fake Army:**
Patton commanded phantom "First U.S. Army Group" (FUSAG) supposedly targeting Calais.

**Deception:**
- Inflatable tanks
- False radio traffic
- Double agents feeding misinformation

**Effect:**
Germans kept 15 divisions at Calais even after D-Day began. Rommel couldn't get reinforcements released.

### Weather Delay

**Original Date:** June 5, 1944

**Storm:**
Eisenhower postponed 24 hours. June 6: brief improvement forecast.

**Decision:**
> "O.K., let's go." — Eisenhower, approving invasion

If delayed further, next suitable tide: late June.

## The Assault

### H-Hour Sequence

**Airborne Drops (12:15-3:30 AM):**
- U.S. 82nd Airborne: Ste-Mère-Église, river crossings
- U.S. 101st Airborne: Utah Beach exits
- British 6th Airborne: Orne bridges, Merville battery

**Problems:**
Paratroopers scattered, some drowned, disoriented. But disrupted German response.

**Naval Bombardment (5:50 AM):**
195,700 sailors; heaviest naval bombardment ever. Pounded defenses (with limited effect on bunkers).

**Beach Landings (6:30 AM onward):**

### The Five Beaches

**Utah Beach (U.S.):**
- Westernmost, Cotentin Peninsula
- Landed 1 mile south of target (current drift)—actually less defended area
- Relatively light casualties: ~200 killed
- Linked with 101st Airborne

**Omaha Beach (U.S.):**
- Bloodiest beach
- Strong defenses: bluffs, bunkers, veteran German troops
- Naval bombardment largely missed targets
- First waves decimated
- Pinned down for hours under withering fire
- Individual heroism eventually broke through
- ~2,000+ casualties

**Gold Beach (British):**
- Central beach
- Moderate resistance
- Arromanches captured (Mulberry harbor site)

**Juno Beach (Canadian):**
- Heavy losses in initial assault (obstacles, rough seas)
- Canadians pushed furthest inland by day's end

**Sword Beach (British):**
- Easternmost
- Linked with British 6th Airborne
- Attacked toward Caen (not captured until July)

## German Response

### Confusion

**Rommel Absent:**
Birthday trip to Germany. Returned late D-Day.

**Panzer Reserves:**
Hitler controlled. Officers afraid to wake him. Armored divisions released late.

**Deception Working:**
Many Germans believed Normandy was diversion; real attack still at Calais.

### Hitler's Reaction

Initially elated—thought invasion could be crushed. Then realized scale.

---

## Heroism and Horror

### Omaha Beach

**"Bloody Omaha":**
First waves suffered 90%+ casualties in some companies. Bodies piling in surf.

**Breakthrough:**
Small groups of soldiers climbed bluffs, attacked bunkers from behind. Naval destroyers came dangerously close to shore for fire support.

**General Cota:**
> "Gentlemen, we are being killed on the beaches. Let us go inland and be killed."

### Pointe du Hoc

**Rangers:**
Scaled 100-foot cliffs under fire to assault German guns (which had been moved). 135 of 225 Rangers became casualties.

### Pegasus Bridge

British glider troops captured Orne River bridges minutes after midnight—first objectives.

---

## Aftermath

### By Nightfall, June 6

**Beached Secured:**
All five beaches connected or nearly so. ~156,000 troops ashore.

**Casualties:**
- Allies: ~10,000 (4,414 confirmed killed)
- Germans: ~4,000-9,000

**Objectives:**
Not all met (Caen not taken), but critical beachhead established.

### The Build-Up

**Mulberry Harbors:**
Artificial harbors constructed to land supplies (one destroyed by storm June 19).

**Reinforcement Race:**
Allies brought troops/supplies faster than Germans could reinforce.

### Breakout

**July-August 1944:**
- Battle of Caen (British)
- Battle of Saint-Lô (U.S.)
- Operation Cobra: American breakout
- Falaise Pocket: German army surrounded, destroyed

**August 25, 1944:**
Paris liberated.

### War's End

**Less than a year later:**
Germany surrendered May 8, 1945.
