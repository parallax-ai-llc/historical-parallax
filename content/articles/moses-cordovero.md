## Summary

Moses Cordovero was a 16th-century Kabbalist in Safed who systematized Kabbalah before the emergence of Lurianic Kabbalah. His Pardes Rimonim (Orchard of Pomegranates) is one of the most comprehensive and systematic works of Jewish mysticism. He sought to harmonize the various kabbalistic traditions and provide a rational framework for understanding the mystical system of the Zohar. He was the teacher of Isaac Luria.
