## Summary

Augustin Fresnel was a French civil engineer and physicist who made major contributions to the wave theory of light. He developed the Fresnel lens, which concentrated light into a narrow beam and revolutionized lighthouses worldwide. His wave optics theory, including diffraction and interference phenomena, decisively established light as a wave. He died of tuberculosis at age 39.
