## Summary

René Descartes (1596-1650) was a French philosopher, mathematician, and scientist widely considered the father of modern Western philosophy. His famous declaration "Cogito, ergo sum" ("I think, therefore I am") established the foundation for his philosophical system based on systematic doubt and the certainty of the thinking self. Descartes pioneered rationalism, arguing that knowledge comes primarily through reason rather than sensory experience. He also invented the Cartesian coordinate system, linking algebra and geometry. His dualism—the distinction between mind (thinking substance) and body (extended substance)—profoundly influenced philosophy of mind, though it remains controversial.

## Early Life

**Birth:** March 31, 1596, La Haye en Touraine, France
**Family:** Minor nobility. Mother died shortly after birth.

**Education:**
- Jesuit college of La Flèche (1607-1615)
- Classical education, mathematics, scholastic philosophy
- University of Poitiers (law degree)

**Formative Experience:**
In stove-heated room (November 10, 1619), had revelatory dreams/visions. Resolved to rebuild philosophy from foundations.

## Method of Doubt

### Meditations on First Philosophy (1641)

Descartes employed radical skepticism to find certainty:

**Stages of Doubt:**
1. **Senses deceive**: Can't trust perception
2. **Dreams**: Can't distinguish dream from waking
3. **Evil demon**: All-powerful deceiver might create false reality

**Cogito:**
One thing cannot be doubted: that I am thinking. Even if deceived, there must be an "I" being deceived.

> "Cogito, ergo sum" — "I think, therefore I am"

This is the foundation; from here, Descartes rebuilds knowledge.

## Major Works

### Discourse on the Method (1637)

Introduced four rules for inquiry:
1. Accept nothing as true unless self-evidently so
2. Divide problems into parts
3. Proceed from simple to complex
4. Review thoroughly

Includes famous autobiographical passages.

### Meditations on First Philosophy (1641)

Six meditations:
- Doubt and certainty
- Cogito
- God's existence (ontological argument)
- Mind-body distinction
- Essence of material things
- Material world exists

### Principles of Philosophy (1644)

Systematic treatise covering metaphysics, physics, cosmology.

### The Passions of the Soul (1649)

Psychology and ethics. Emotions classified and analyzed.

## Key Ideas

### Mind-Body Dualism

**Two Substances:**
- **Res cogitans** (thinking substance): Mind, consciousness
- **Res extensa** (extended substance): Body, physical world

**Interaction Problem:**
How do mind and body interact? Descartes suggested pineal gland as connection point—unsatisfying.

**Influence:**
Dualism dominated Western thought. Still debated in philosophy of mind.

### Rationalism

Knowledge comes through reason, not senses. Innate ideas (God, mathematics) exist in mind prior to experience.

### Cartesian Mechanism

Physical world operates like machine—laws of motion, mechanical causation. Influenced scientific revolution.

### Mathematics

**Cartesian Coordinates:**
Invented analytical geometry—plotting geometric figures on algebraic coordinates. Foundation of modern mathematics.

## Personal Life

**Netherlands:**
Lived in Holland (1628-1649) for intellectual freedom.

**Daughter:**
Had daughter Francine (1635) with Helena Jans. Francine died age 5—Descartes deeply affected.

**Privacy:**
Motto: "He who hid well, lived well." Moved frequently, valued solitude.

## Death

**Sweden:**
Invited by Queen Christina of Sweden (1649). Required to teach philosophy at 5 AM in cold palace.

**Death:** February 11, 1650, Stockholm. Pneumonia. Age 53.

**Burial:**
Originally in Sweden; remains moved to Paris (1667). Now in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

## Legacy

**Philosophy:**
- Father of modern philosophy
- Rationalist tradition (Spinoza, Leibniz)
- Mind-body problem central to philosophy
- Method of doubt influenced all subsequent epistemology

**Mathematics:**
- Cartesian coordinates
- Analytical geometry
- Influenced calculus development

**Science:**
- Mechanical world-view
- Scientific method
- Influenced Newton

**Criticism:**
- Dualism problematic
- Circularity in proofs (Cartesian circle)
- Mathematics isn't simply innate

## Famous Quotes

> "Cogito, ergo sum." ("I think, therefore I am.")
