## Summary

Hannibal Barca (247-c. 183 BCE) was a Carthaginian general considered one of the greatest military commanders in history. Famous for leading his army, including war elephants, across the Alps to invade Italy during the Second Punic War (218-201 BCE), Hannibal defeated Roman armies repeatedly for 15 years on Italian soil, including the catastrophic Roman defeat at Cannae. Despite never losing a major battle in Italy, Hannibal ultimately failed to capture Rome and was recalled to defend Carthage, where he was finally defeated by Scipio Africanus at Zama. His tactical genius—particularly the double envelopment at Cannae—is still studied at military academies worldwide.

## Second Punic War (218-201 BCE)

### Crossing the Alps (218 BCE)

**Strategy:**
Rome expected naval war. Hannibal chose invasion by land—through Gaul and over the Alps into Italy.

**Journey:**
- 90,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, 37 war elephants
- Crossed Pyrenees, Rhône River
- Crossed Alps in 15 days (September)
- Lost perhaps half his army to cold, attacks, falls
- Arrived in Italy with ~26,000 men, few elephants

**Achievement:**
One of history's most audacious military maneuvers.

### Italian Campaign

**Early Victories:**

**Ticinus (218):** Defeated Roman cavalry.

**Trebia (218):** Destroyed Roman army through ambush.

**Lake Trasimene (217):** Largest ambush in history—15,000 Romans killed.

**Cannae (216):**
Hannibal's masterpiece. Faced 86,000 Romans with 50,000 men. Used double envelopment—cavalry defeated Roman wings, then encircled infantry. 50,000-70,000 Romans killed. Worst defeat in Roman history.

**Aftermath:**
Many Italian allies defected to Hannibal. But Rome refused to surrender.

### Stalemate (216-203 BCE)

**Roman Strategy:**
Fabius Maximus ("Delayer") avoided battle, harassed Hannibal, reconquered territories.

**Hannibal's Problem:**
- No siege equipment to take Rome
- Couldn't receive reinforcements (Rome controlled seas)
- Italian allies gradually recovered by Rome
- 15 years in Italy without decisive result

## Defeat and Exile

### Zama (202 BCE)

**Scipio Africanus:**
Roman general invaded Africa. Hannibal recalled to defend Carthage.

**Battle of Zama:**
Hannibal's first and only major defeat. Roman cavalry (Numidian allies) turned battle. Carthage surrendered.

**Peace Terms:**
Carthage lost empire, fleet, paid massive indemnity.

### Post-War Career

**Carthaginian Politics:**
Became suffete (chief magistrate). Reformed government, economy.

**Exile:**
Romans demanded his surrender. Fled to Seleucid Empire (Syria), then Bithynia (Turkey).

**Death (c. 183 BCE):**
Romans pursuing him to Bithynia. Rather than be captured, took poison he carried in his ring.

Last words: "Let us relieve the Romans of the anxiety they have so long experienced, since they think it tries their patience too much to wait for an old man's death."
