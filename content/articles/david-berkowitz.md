## Summary
David Berkowitz, the 'Son of Sam,' terrorized New York City from July 1976 to July 1977. He shot 13 people, killing six and wounding seven, targeting young women and couples in parked cars. He claimed a demon speaking through a neighbor's dog ordered the killings. His case led to 'Son of Sam laws.'

## Early Life
Born Richard David Falco on June 1, 1953, in Brooklyn, adopted by Nathan and Pearl Berkowitz. A troubled child prone to arson, he became withdrawn after his adoptive mother's death. He served in the Army from 1971-1974 before retreating into isolation. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between July 1976 and July 1977, Berkowitz shot 13 people in eight attacks across the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn using a .44 caliber revolver. He sent taunting letters to police and columnist Jimmy Breslin, signing them 'Son of Sam.' [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Identified through a parking ticket near his final shooting scene, Berkowitz was arrested August 10, 1977, confessing immediately. He was sentenced to six consecutive terms of 25 years to life. He later recanted the demon story and became a born-again Christian in prison. [^3]
