## Summary

George Cayley is considered the father of aerodynamics and the airplane. He identified the four forces of flight — lift, drag, weight, and thrust — and built the first successful human-carrying glider in 1853. His theoretical and practical work laid the scientific foundation for aviation over 50 years before the Wright brothers.
