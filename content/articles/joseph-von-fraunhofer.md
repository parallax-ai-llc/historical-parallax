## Summary

Joseph von Fraunhofer was a German physicist and optician who discovered the dark absorption lines in the solar spectrum now known as Fraunhofer lines. He developed the spectroscope and the diffraction grating, fundamental tools in spectroscopy. His precision optical instruments revolutionized astronomy and physics. Despite humble origins as an orphaned lens grinder, he became one of the greatest experimental physicists of his era.
