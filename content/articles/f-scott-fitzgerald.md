## Summary

F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896-1940) stands as one of the most celebrated American authors of the 20th century, widely recognized for capturing the spirit of the Jazz Age in his fiction. His masterpiece, *The Great Gatsby* (1925), is considered one of the greatest American novels ever written, though it achieved its iconic status only after his death. Fitzgerald's tumultuous personal life, marked by his passionate relationship with his wife Zelda and his struggles with alcoholism, became inextricably linked with his literary work. Despite critical acclaim, he died believing himself a failure, only to be rediscovered and canonized as a central figure in American literature during the post-World War II era.[^1]

## Early Life and Background

Francis Scott Key Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896, in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Edward Fitzgerald and Mary "Mollie" McQuillan Fitzgerald. He was named after his distant cousin, Francis Scott Key, the author of "The Star-Spangled Banner."[^2] His family occupied an uncomfortable position in society—his father came from old Maryland stock but had limited financial success, while his mother's family had acquired wealth through the grocery business, a source of both financial security and social embarrassment for the status-conscious young Fitzgerald.[^3]

This early exposure to class divisions and social hierarchies would profoundly influence Fitzgerald's literary career, becoming a central theme in nearly all his major works. He attended the St. Paul Academy, where he published his first piece of fiction in the school newspaper at age 13.[^4] In 1911, his parents sent him to the Newman School, a prestigious Catholic preparatory school in New Jersey, where he met Father Sigourney Fay, who became an important mentor and encouraged his literary ambitions.[^5]

In 1913, Fitzgerald entered Princeton University, where he threw himself into extracurricular activities, writing for the Princeton Triangle Club, the Nassau Literary Magazine, and the humor magazine Princeton Tiger.[^6] His academic performance suffered due to his focus on social and literary pursuits, and he struggled with feelings of inadequacy among his wealthier classmates. These Princeton years crystallized his fascination with wealth, privilege, and the American Dream—themes that would define his greatest works.[^7] He left Princeton in 1917 without graduating, joining the U.S. Army as World War I escalated, though he never saw combat.[^8]

## Rise to Prominence

Fitzgerald's meteoric rise to literary fame began while he was stationed at Camp Sheridan in Montgomery, Alabama, where he met Zelda Sayre at a country club dance in July 1918.[^9] Zelda, the beautiful and vivacious daughter of an Alabama Supreme Court judge, became his obsession and muse. She initially refused his marriage proposal, concerned about his financial prospects—a rejection that intensified his determination to achieve literary and financial success.[^10]

During his military service, Fitzgerald had been working on a novel. After his discharge in 1919, he rewrote it extensively, and in 1920, Charles Scribner's Sons published *This Side of Paradise*. The novel was an immediate sensation, capturing the attitudes and anxieties of the post-war generation with unprecedented authenticity.[^11] The book sold out within days, and at age 23, Fitzgerald became a literary celebrity overnight. The novel's success—both critical and commercial—earned him approximately $18,000 in its first year, equivalent to several hundred thousand dollars today.[^12]

With his newfound fame and fortune, Fitzgerald married Zelda Sayre on April 3, 1920, in New York City's St. Patrick's Cathedral.[^13] The couple quickly became emblematic of the Jazz Age they would come to define—young, beautiful, talented, and reckless. They lived extravagantly, moving between New York and Europe, attending endless parties, and spending money as quickly as Fitzgerald could earn it through his novels, short stories, and magazine work.[^14]

Fitzgerald's second novel, *The Beautiful and Damned* (1922), explored the deterioration of a marriage and the corrupting influence of wealth, drawing heavily on his own experiences with Zelda.[^15] Though less commercially successful than his debut, it cemented his reputation as a serious novelist. He also became one of the highest-paid short story writers in America, with magazines like The Saturday Evening Post paying him up to $4,000 per story.[^16] This period saw him producing stories at a rapid pace to maintain the lavish lifestyle he and Zelda had adopted.

## Major Achievements

Fitzgerald's literary legacy rests primarily on his novels and short stories, which captured the essence of 1920s America with unparalleled precision and artistry. His masterpiece, *The Great Gatsby*, published in 1925, represents the apex of his artistic achievement.[^17] The novel tells the story of Jay Gatsby's obsessive pursuit of Daisy Buchanan, exploring themes of wealth, class, love, and the corruption of the American Dream. Written with extraordinary economy and symbolic richness, the novel features some of the most memorable prose in American literature, including the iconic final lines: "So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past."[^18]

Though *The Great Gatsby* received positive reviews from critics like H.L. Mencken and T.S. Eliot, it was a commercial disappointment upon publication, selling only about 20,000 copies in Fitzgerald's lifetime.[^19] The novel's reputation grew gradually, and it is now widely considered one of the greatest American novels, regularly topping lists of essential literature and selling over 25 million copies worldwide.[^20] Its influence extends beyond literature into film, theater, and popular culture, with numerous adaptations including Baz Luhrmann's 2013 film starring Leonardo DiCaprio.[^21]

Fitzgerald's short stories represent another major achievement, demonstrating his versatility and craftsmanship. Stories like "The Diamond as Big as the Ritz" (1922), "Winter Dreams" (1922), "The Rich Boy" (1926), and "Babylon Revisited" (1931) are considered masterpieces of the form.[^22] These stories often explored similar themes to his novels—the allure and emptiness of wealth, the passage of time, and lost opportunities—but with remarkable compression and intensity. His ability to capture complex emotional states and social dynamics in relatively short narratives showcased his technical brilliance.[^23]

His novel *Tender Is the Night* (1934), though initially received with mixed reviews, has gained recognition as a profound exploration of mental illness, expatriate life, and the cost of ambition.[^24] The novel drew heavily on the Fitzgeralds' experiences in Europe and Zelda's mental breakdown, creating a haunting portrait of disintegration. Many modern critics consider it equal to or even superior to *The Great Gatsby* in its psychological depth and structural complexity.[^25]

Beyond individual works, Fitzgerald's achievement lies in his role as the chronicler and critic of the Jazz Age. He coined the term "Jazz Age" and both celebrated and interrogated the era's excesses, contradictions, and ultimate hollowness.[^26] His work created an enduring portrait of 1920s America that shaped how subsequent generations understood the period. His prose style—lyrical, precise, and infused with both romance and disillusionment—influenced countless writers and established new possibilities for American fiction.[^27]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his literary brilliance, Fitzgerald's career and personal life were marked by significant controversies and failures. His greatest struggle was with alcoholism, which began in his Princeton years but escalated dramatically throughout the 1920s and 1930s.[^28] His drinking damaged his relationships, undermined his productivity, and contributed to his financial difficulties. Friends and colleagues, including Ernest Hemingway, expressed frustration with his behavior, and his alcoholism became legendary in literary circles.[^29]

Fitzgerald's relationship with Hemingway itself became a source of controversy and criticism. After initially befriending Hemingway in Paris in 1925, their relationship deteriorated, with Hemingway later portraying Fitzgerald cruelly in his memoir *A Moveable Feast*, depicting him as weak, dominated by Zelda, and overly concerned with status.[^30] While some view Hemingway's account as unfair and self-serving, it contributed to a perception of Fitzgerald as professionally undisciplined and personally weak-willed.[^31]

His treatment of Zelda has also drawn criticism, particularly from feminist scholars. When Zelda attempted to establish her own artistic career as a writer and painter, Fitzgerald was often unsupportive and even possessive of material from their shared experiences.[^32] After Zelda's first mental breakdown in 1930, Fitzgerald used details of her illness and treatment in *Tender Is the Night*, which some viewed as exploitative.[^33] Their relationship, while passionate, was also volatile and mutually destructive, with both partners contributing to the other's decline.[^34]

Fitzgerald's financial irresponsibility became another point of criticism. Despite earning substantial sums—over $400,000 during his career (millions in today's dollars)—he died deeply in debt.[^35] His extravagant lifestyle, combined with medical expenses for Zelda's psychiatric care and his daughter Scottie's education, left him perpetually scrambling for money. This financial pressure forced him to write formulaic stories for magazines rather than focusing on novels, which some critics saw as prostituting his talent.[^36]

The critical and commercial failure of *Tender Is the Night* in 1934 devastated Fitzgerald and marked the beginning of his "Crack-Up" period—a series of confessional essays published in Esquire magazine in 1936.[^37] In these essays, he candidly discussed his emotional and creative collapse, admitting "I had been mortgaging myself physically and spiritually up to the hilt."[^38] While now valued for their honesty, these essays damaged his reputation at the time, with contemporaries like Hemingway viewing them as embarrassing public self-pity.[^39]

His final years in Hollywood, where he worked as a screenwriter to pay his debts, are often portrayed as a tragic decline. Though he worked on major films and earned good money, he received only one screen credit and felt creatively stifled by the studio system.[^40] His unfinished novel *The Last Tycoon*, set in Hollywood, suggested he was finding new creative energy, but his death at 44 from a heart attack—caused by years of alcohol abuse—cut short any potential comeback.[^41]

---

## Personal Life

Fitzgerald's personal life was inseparable from his artistic identity, with his marriage to Zelda Sayre forming the central drama of his existence. Their relationship embodied the glamour and destructiveness of the Jazz Age they came to symbolize.[^42] Zelda was beautiful, talented, and unconventional—a Southern belle who smoked, drank, and challenged social conventions. Their courtship and early marriage were passionate and tumultuous, marked by jealousy, public fights, and mutual devotion.[^43]

The couple had one child, Frances Scott "Scottie" Fitzgerald, born in 1921.[^44] Fitzgerald was a devoted but often absent father, torn between his parental responsibilities and his need for the social life that fueled his writing. His letters to Scottie reveal a man deeply concerned with her education and character development, offering detailed advice on reading, conduct, and avoiding his own mistakes.[^45] Despite the chaos of her parents' lives, Scottie had a relatively stable upbringing, largely due to boarding schools and the support of friends like the Murphys.[^46]

Zelda's mental illness became the defining crisis of Fitzgerald's later life. She suffered her first breakdown in 1930, and was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia (though modern scholars debate this diagnosis).[^47] She spent much of the 1930s in and out of psychiatric hospitals, including Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, where she died in a fire in 1948, eight years after Fitzgerald's death.[^48] The enormous expense of her treatment added to Fitzgerald's financial burdens and contributed to his emotional exhaustion.

During his final years in Hollywood, Fitzgerald had a relationship with columnist Sheilah Graham, who provided stability and support during his last years.[^49] Graham later wrote several memoirs about their relationship, portraying Fitzgerald as brilliant but damaged, struggling with alcoholism while attempting to rebuild his career and complete *The Last Tycoon*.[^50] This relationship showed a more mature, though still troubled, Fitzgerald attempting sobriety and literary redemption.

Fitzgerald's personality was marked by contradictions—he was simultaneously arrogant and insecure, generous and self-centered, romantic and cynical.[^51] Friends described him as charming and engaging when sober, but unpredictable and sometimes cruel when drinking.[^52] His letters and essays reveal a man of deep self-awareness, capable of analyzing his own flaws with brutal honesty, yet often unable to change his self-destructive behaviors.[^53]

## Legacy

F. Scott Fitzgerald's legacy transformed dramatically after his death. He died on December 21, 1940, believing himself a failure, his books out of print and largely forgotten.[^54] His obituary in *The New York Times* was respectful but suggested his moment had passed, stating he was "a spokesman of the generation that came of age during the first World War."[^55] However, the 1940s and 1950s saw a remarkable Fitzgerald revival, led by critics like Edmund Wilson, who edited *The Last Tycoon* and *The Crack-Up*, and scholars who recognized his artistic achievement.[^56]

*The Great Gatsby* became central to American literature curricula, introducing millions of students to Fitzgerald's work and ensuring its permanent place in the canon.[^57] The novel's examination of the American Dream, class mobility, and the corruption of idealism resonated powerfully in post-World War II America and continues to speak to contemporary concerns about wealth inequality and social aspiration.[^58] It has never been out of print since the 1940s and sells over 500,000 copies annually in the United States alone.[^59]

Fitzgerald's influence on subsequent American writers has been profound. Writers as diverse as J.D. Salinger, Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff, and Donna Tartt have acknowledged his influence on their work.[^60] His prose style—particularly his ability to combine lyrical beauty with emotional precision—set new standards for American fiction.[^61] His exploration of themes like wealth, class, and American identity established templates that writers continue to engage with today.[^62]

Beyond literature, Fitzgerald's life and work have become cultural touchstones. The image of Scott and Zelda as doomed Jazz Age icons has inspired countless books, films, plays, and even musicals.[^63] His personal story—the meteoric rise to fame, the glamorous lifestyle, the tragic decline—embodies a particularly American narrative of success and failure that continues to fascinate audiences.[^64]

The Fitzgerald industry includes scholarly journals, academic conferences, historical societies, and tourist sites. His homes in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Montgomery, Alabama, are preserved as museums.[^65] The F. Scott Fitzgerald Society, founded in 1992, promotes scholarly study of his work and organizes international conferences.[^66] This institutional support ensures continued academic engagement with his writing.

Fitzgerald's work has also achieved remarkable international reach, with translations in dozens of languages and strong readerships in countries from Japan to Brazil to Russia.[^67] His portrayal of American culture and values has shaped global perceptions of the United States, for better and worse. The 2013 film adaptation of *The Great Gatsby* grossed over $350 million worldwide, demonstrating the continued commercial viability of his work.[^68]

His legacy extends to social criticism as well. Fitzgerald's penetrating analysis of wealth, class, and the American Dream provides critical tools for understanding contemporary inequality and social stratification.[^69] His work anticipated many critiques of consumer culture, celebrity worship, and the emptiness of material success that have become even more relevant in the 21st century.[^70]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Literary scholars and critics have consistently ranked Fitzgerald among the greatest American novelists. Harold Bloom included *The Great Gatsby* in his Western Canon, arguing it represented "the American moment" in literature.[^71] Critic Lionel Trilling praised Fitzgerald's "gift for hope" and his ability to invest the American Dream with tragic dignity even while exposing its illusions.[^72] Malcolm Cowley, who helped lead the Fitzgerald revival, argued that he was "better than he knew" and that his work would last because of its "mythical quality."[^73]

Contemporary writers have been equally admiring. T.S. Eliot called *The Great Gatsby* "the first step that American fiction has taken since Henry James."[^74] More recently, writer Jay McInerney argued that Fitzgerald "created the template for the American writer as celebrity, for better and worse," while also producing work of lasting artistic merit.[^75] Joyce Carol Oates praised his "uncanny ability to dramatize the tension between idealism and reality that defines the American character."[^76]

Scholars have increasingly recognized Fitzgerald's technical sophistication. Critics like Matthew Bruccoli and Ruth Prigozy have detailed his careful craftsmanship, his mastery of point of view, and his use of symbolism and structure.[^77] *The Great Gatsby*'s narrative technique—the use of Nick Carraway as an unreliable narrator who is both inside and outside the action—is now seen as a major innovation in American fiction.[^78]

Feminist critics have found value in Fitzgerald's complex female characters, despite his personal treatment of Zelda. Scholars like Nancy Milford and Kendall Taylor have argued that characters like Daisy Buchanan, Nicole Diver, and Rosalind Connage are more nuanced than early critics recognized, reflecting Fitzgerald's awareness of the constraints placed on women in his era.[^79] His portrayal of Zelda-based characters, while problematic, also documented the frustrations of talented women denied full creative expression.[^80]

Defenders of Fitzgerald's life choices argue that his struggles with alcoholism and financial instability reflected broader cultural pressures and personal demons rather than simple moral failure.[^81] Biographer Jeffrey Meyers suggests that "Fitzgerald's life was tragic, but his tragedy produced art of enduring value that justifies his choices and sacrifices."[^82] Some scholars view his crack-up essays as pioneering works of confessional writing that prefigured the personal essay movement.[^83]

---

### Negative Views

Despite widespread admiration, Fitzgerald has faced significant criticism. Some scholars argue his work is limited by its focus on the wealthy and privileged, offering little insight into working-class life or broader social structures.[^84] Critic Leslie Fiedler dismissed Fitzgerald as a "perpetual adolescent" whose work never matured beyond youthful romantic obsessions.[^85] Marxist critics have argued that while Fitzgerald critiqued wealth, he remained too fascinated by it to mount effective social criticism, ultimately reinforcing rather than challenging class hierarchies.[^86]

Hemingway's devastating portrait in *A Moveable Feast* damaged Fitzgerald's reputation, depicting him as weak, vain, and dominated by a mentally unstable wife.[^87] Though many scholars now view Hemingway's account as unfair and motivated by jealousy, it contributed to a perception of Fitzgerald as lacking the masculine toughness and artistic discipline of his modernist peers.[^88] This gendered critique has been challenged by recent scholars but remains influential in popular perceptions.[^89]

Feminist critics have condemned Fitzgerald's treatment of Zelda, particularly his appropriation of her experiences and words for his fiction.[^90] Nancy Milford's biography of Zelda portrayed Scott as threatened by her talent and deliberately undermining her attempts at independent artistic achievement.[^91] Critics have noted that Fitzgerald used material directly from Zelda's letters and diaries without attribution, and that he discouraged her writing career while mining their relationship for his own work.[^92]

Some critics find his prose style overly romantic and sentimental, lacking the hardness and precision of Hemingway or the experimental boldness of Faulkner.[^93] Writer Edmund Wilson, despite being Fitzgerald's friend and advocate, criticized his "loose" writing and tendency toward cliché when writing quickly for money.[^94] The vast difference in quality between his best work and his commercial magazine stories has led some to question his artistic integrity.[^95]

Fitzgerald's alcoholism and erratic behavior have been viewed as unprofessional and self-indulgent. Unlike writers like Eugene O'Neill or Malcolm Lowry, who transformed their struggles with alcohol into their art, Fitzgerald's drinking is often seen as simply destructive, preventing rather than enabling creation.[^96] His public drunkenness and unreliability in Hollywood damaged his professional reputation and contributed to his inability to complete projects.[^97]

Critics have also questioned the depth of his social criticism. While Fitzgerald portrayed the emptiness of wealth and the corruption of the American Dream, he offered no alternative vision or path to social change.[^98] His characters remain trapped in their class positions, suggesting a deterministic worldview that some find politically conservative.[^99] Unlike contemporaries like John Dos Passos or Sinclair Lewis, Fitzgerald never engaged directly with political movements or offered programmatic critiques of capitalism.[^100]
