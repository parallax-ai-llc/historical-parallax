## Summary

Philip Drinker invented the iron lung (Drinker respirator) in 1928, a mechanical ventilator that saved thousands of polio patients who could not breathe on their own. His device used negative pressure to expand the chest and draw air into the lungs. The iron lung became the iconic symbol of polio treatment until the Salk vaccine.
