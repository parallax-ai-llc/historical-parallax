James Lovelock was a British scientist, environmentalist, and inventor who proposed the Gaia hypothesis, which suggests that the Earth's biosphere acts as a self-regulating system. He invented the electron capture detector, which was instrumental in detecting CFCs in the atmosphere and understanding ozone depletion. His work bridged chemistry, biology, and earth science. He died on his 103rd birthday.
