## Summary

William Tyndale was an English scholar who produced the first printed English translation of the New Testament from Greek. His translation work formed the basis for later English Bibles, including the King James Version. He was forced to work in exile on the Continent due to opposition from English authorities. He was strangled and burned at the stake near Brussels for heresy.
