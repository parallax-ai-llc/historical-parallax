## Overview

In the late 1980s, Japan was the envy of the world. "Japan as Number One" was a bestseller. The Tokyo Imperial Palace grounds were famously valued more than the entire state of California. The Nikkei index hit nearly 40,000. It was a mania fueled by cheap credit and corporate speculation (Zaitech). Then, in 1991, the bubble burst. Stock prices fell 60%, land prices plummeted, and banks were left with mountains of bad debt. Japan entered a deflationary trap known as the "Lost Decade" (now "Lost 30 Years")—a cautionary tale of zombie companies and an aging population.

## The Bubble Economy (1986-1991)

**Crazy Prices:**
Golf club memberships sold for millions of dollars.
Waitresses were tipped with $100 bills.
Japanese corporations bought Rockefeller Center and Columbia Pictures.
**The Cause:**
The Plaza Accord (1985) strengthened the Yen. To help exporters, the Bank of Japan lowered interest rates too low for too long.

## The Burst

The BoJ belatedly raised interest rates to cool the market. It worked too well.
**Real Estate Crash:**
Commercial property values fell 87% from peak.
**Zombie Banks:**
Instead of letting bankrupt companies fail, banks kept lending them money ("evergreening") to hide losses. This sucked capital away from productive new startups.

## Legacy: The Deflationary Mindset

For a generation, Japanese prices *dropped*.
Why buy a TV today if it will be cheaper next month? Consumption froze.
**Hikikomori & Herbivore Men:**
The economic malaise coincided with social withdrawal. Young men gave up on career ambition and marriage.
Japan became the laboratory for "secular stagnation," a condition now threatening Europe and China.
