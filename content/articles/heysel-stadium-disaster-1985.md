## Overview

The Heysel Stadium disaster occurred on May 29, 1985, at the European Cup Final between Liverpool (England) and Juventus (Italy) in Brussels. Before kickoff, Liverpool hooligans charged at Juventus fans in a "neutral" section (Section Z). Fleeing Italian fans were pressed against a dilapidated concrete retaining wall, which collapsed under the crush. 39 people died (mostly Italians) and 600 were injured. The tragedy led to a ban on all English football clubs from European competition for five years and forced a reckoning with the culture of football hooliganism.

## Background

### Context

**Liverpool FC:**
Dominant team in Europe (4 cups in 8 years).
Fans known for traveling in huge numbers.

**Juventus:**
Italian giants. Michel Platini (star player).

**Heysel Stadium:**
Built 1930. Crumbling ("rotten concrete"). Inadequate fencing. Cinder block walls.
Both clubs had asked for a different venue. UEFA refused.

**Segregation:**
Section Z was meant for "neutral" Belgian fans but was sold on black market to Juventus fans.
Only a flimsy chain-link fence separated them from Liverpool ultras (Sector X/Y).

## The Disaster

### 7:00 PM (One hour before kickoff)

**Charge:**
Liverpool fans threw stones/missiles. Then charged the fence.
Fence gave way. They rushed Section Z.

**Panic:**
Juventus fans (many families) retreated. Pressed against concrete wall at perimeter.

**Collapse:**
Pressure was too great. Wall collapsed. Fans crushed under rubble and trampled by crowd.

**39 Dead:**
- 32 Italians
- 4 Belgians
- 2 French
- 1 Northern Irish

### The Game Must Go On

**Controversy:**
Authorities decided to play the match to prevent total riot (violence spreading to streets).
Captains spoke to crowd.
Dead bodies were piled outside stadium as game started.
**Juventus won 1-0** (Platini penalty). Players celebrated, unaware of extent of tragedy (or so they claimed).

## Aftermath

### Punishments

**English Ban:**
