## Summary

Zhou Dunyi was a Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher who is considered the pioneer of Song Dynasty Neo-Confucianism. His short work Taijitu Shuo (Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate) provided the cosmological foundation for Neo-Confucian metaphysics. He integrated Taoist and Buddhist concepts into Confucian philosophy, creating a new synthesis. Both Zhu Xi and the Cheng brothers claimed him as their intellectual ancestor.
