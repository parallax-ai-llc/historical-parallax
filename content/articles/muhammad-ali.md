## Summary

Muhammad Ali (1942-2016), born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., was an American professional boxer, activist, and philanthropist widely regarded as the greatest heavyweight champion of all time. Known for his unorthodox fighting style ("float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"), brash self-promotion, and quick wit, Ali won the world heavyweight title three times. Beyond boxing, he became a global icon for his conversion to Islam, refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War ("I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong"), and advocacy for civil rights. His principled stand cost him his title and prime years but made him a symbol of resistance. Ali remains one of the most recognized and celebrated figures of the 20th century.
