## Summary
William George Bonin, the 'Freeway Killer,' was an American serial killer who raped and murdered at least 14 young men and boys in Southern California between 1979 and 1980. He dumped victims' bodies along freeways. He was the first person executed by lethal injection in California.

## Early Life
Born January 8, 1947, in Connecticut. He was raised in an abusive household and sexually assaulted as a child. He served in Vietnam and was honorably discharged. He had prior convictions for sexual assault. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1979 and 1980, Bonin, sometimes with accomplices, abducted teenage boys and young men from the streets of Southern California. He raped and tortured them before strangling or stabbing them. He dumped their bodies along freeways in Orange County and Los Angeles County. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Bonin was arrested on June 11, 1980, while in the act of assaulting a boy in his van. He was convicted of 14 murders in two trials. He was executed by lethal injection on February 23, 1996 — the first execution by that method in California. [^3]
