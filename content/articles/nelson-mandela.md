## Summary

Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. The country's first Black head of state and first elected in a fully representative democratic election, Mandela focused on dismantling apartheid's legacy through racial reconciliation. After 27 years in prison for his anti-apartheid activities, Mandela became a global symbol of resistance to racial oppression. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and is revered in South Africa as the "Father of the Nation." Mandela's transition from militant activist to reconciler, his dignity during imprisonment, and his forgiveness toward oppressors made him one of the 20th century's most admired figures.
