## Summary

Theodosius I, known as Theodosius the Great (347-395 CE), was Roman emperor who ruled the Eastern Empire from 379 to 392 and then became the last emperor to rule both the Eastern and Western halves of the Roman Empire from 392 until his death in 395.[^1] His reign marked a pivotal transformation in Roman history, as he established Nicene Christianity as the official state religion through the Edict of Thessalonica in 380 CE, vigorously suppressed paganism and Arianism, and permanently divided the empire between his two sons upon his death.[^2] While celebrated by Christian historians as a champion of orthodoxy, Theodosius remains a controversial figure whose legacy includes both the Christianization of Rome and the Massacre of Thessalonica, one of the most infamous atrocities in late Roman history.[^3] His policies toward the Goths, granting them autonomous status within imperial borders, would have lasting consequences for the empire's stability and eventual transformation.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Theodosius was born on January 11, 347 CE in Cauca, Gallaecia (modern Coca, Spain), into a family of minor landed aristocrats in Hispania.[^5] His father, Theodosius the Elder, was a highly successful and distinguished general (magister equitum) who served under the western Roman emperor Valentinian I, achieving military renown through campaigns across the empire.[^6] His mother was named Thermantia, and his grandparents, like his parents, were probably already Christians, indicating the family's early adoption of the faith that would define his reign.[^7]

The exact nature of Theodosius's upbringing remains somewhat obscure in the historical record. The 5th-century church historian Theodoret claimed the future emperor grew up and was educated in his Iberian homeland, though one modern historian suggests Theodosius more likely grew up among the army, participating in his father's campaigns throughout the provinces, as was customary for families with a tradition of military service.[^8] Unlike many Roman aristocrats, Theodosius did not receive an extensive classical education, but he was intellectually open-minded and developed a particular interest in the study of history, which he valued as a guide to his conduct throughout life.[^9]

Theodosius's early military career began in earnest when he accompanied his father to Britain on an expedition in 368-369 to suppress the "Great Conspiracy," a concerted Celtic and Germanic invasion of the island provinces.[^10] This experience provided the young Theodosius with valuable exposure to military command and the complexities of defending Rome's far-flung frontiers. After probably serving on his father's staff during further campaigns, Theodosius received his first independent command by 374 when he was appointed dux (commanding officer) of the province of Moesia Prima along the Danube frontier.[^11] In autumn 374, he successfully repulsed an incursion of Sarmatians on his sector of the frontier and forced them into submission, demonstrating the military competence that would later recommend him for imperial office.[^12]

However, tragedy struck when Theodosius's father fell from favor and was executed for high treason in 376, for reasons that remain unclear in the historical sources.[^13] This sudden reversal of fortune forced the younger Theodosius to withdraw from military service and retreat to civilian life in Cauca, his family's estates in Spain. Around 376, during this period of retirement, he married Aelia Flaccilla, a woman also of Spanish descent, who would become his empress and bear him three children.[^14]

---

## Rise to Power

Theodosius's unexpected path to imperial power began with one of the most catastrophic military defeats in Roman history. On August 9, 378 CE, Emperor Valens and his army were annihilated by Gothic forces at the Battle of Adrianople in Thrace, leaving two-thirds of the eastern Roman army dead and the emperor himself killed on the battlefield.[^15] This disaster left the Eastern Empire in crisis, with its borders vulnerable to Gothic raiders and much of its military leadership dead, discredited, or of barbarian origin.[^16] 

In this desperate situation, the western emperor Gratian recalled Theodosius from his Spanish exile. When Theodosius once again proved his military ability through a victory over the Sarmatians, Gratian made the decisive choice to elevate him to imperial rank.[^17] On January 19, 379 CE, with the begrudging consent of Gratian, Theodosius was formally invested with the purple by a council of officials at Sirmium and proclaimed co-emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire.[^18]

His dominion encompassed the Eastern portion of the empire, including the critically important provinces of Dacia (present-day Romania) and Macedonia, which had been especially devastated by barbarian infiltration in the preceding years.[^19] The immediate and overwhelming problem facing the new emperor was how to check the bands of Goths that were laying waste to the Balkans with an army that had been severely depleted of manpower following the debacle at Adrianople.[^20]

Theodosius initially pursued a military strategy, conducting campaigns against the Gothic raiders throughout 379 and 380. However, a severe illness in early 380 forced him to halt operations in Thessalonica.[^21] It was during this period of illness that he was baptized by Bishop Ascholius of Thessalonica, an event that would profoundly influence his subsequent religious policies.[^22] Rather than continuing what had become a costly and indecisive military conflict, Theodosius ultimately chose a diplomatic solution. In 382 CE, he concluded a groundbreaking treaty with the Goths that granted them the status of foederati, allowing them to settle within imperial borders as semi-autonomous allies who would provide military service to Rome in exchange for land and subsidies.[^23] Though this arrangement secured peace during Theodosius's lifetime, it established a precedent that many historians consider a factor in the eventual transformation and fragmentation of the Western Roman Empire.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### The Edict of Thessalonica and Establishment of Nicene Christianity

Theodosius's most enduring achievement was making Nicene Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. On February 27, 380 CE, shortly after his baptism, Theodosius issued the Edict of Thessalonica jointly with emperors Gratian and Valentinian II.[^25] This landmark decree made Nicene Christianity the state church of the Roman Empire and condemned other Christian creeds such as Arianism as heresies of "foolish madmen," authorizing their punishment.[^26] The edict constituted the first known secular law which included in its preamble a clear definition of what a Christian Roman ruler considered religious orthodoxy, opening the way for state-sanctioned repression against dissidents qualified as "heretics."[^27]

The Edict of Thessalonica was subsequently incorporated into Book XVI of the Theodosian Code and became a milestone in the official Christianization of the Roman Empire.[^28] To consolidate this religious transformation, in May 381, Theodosius summoned the First Council of Constantinople to repair the schism between East and West on the basis of Nicene orthodoxy.[^29] This ecumenical council declared the Trinitarian doctrine of the equality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the Son, expanded the Nicene Creed, and condemned Arianism, which began to die out with further prohibitions.[^30] At the council's close, Theodosius issued an imperial decree declaring that churches should be restored to those bishops who confessed the equal divinity of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, with Arian pastors to be expelled from their positions.[^31]

### Military Victories and Political Consolidation

Theodosius demonstrated considerable military and political acumen in securing his position and reunifying the empire. His first major military challenge came from Magnus Maximus, a Roman general serving in Britain who usurped power in 383 CE by rebelling against Emperor Gratian.[^32] After Maximus killed Gratian at Lugdunum (Lyon) on August 25, 383, Theodosius initially brokered a peace agreement that allowed Maximus to rule Britannia and Gaul while Gratian's brother Valentinian II retained Italy, Spain, Pannonia, and Africa.[^33]

However, when Maximus invaded Italy in 388 attempting to seize complete control of the Western Empire, Theodosius decisively defeated him at the battles of the Save and Poetovio in modern-day Croatia and Slovenia.[^34] Maximus was captured and executed in Aquileia on August 28, 388, along with his son Flavius Victor.[^35] Theodosius's final military triumph came at the Battle of the Frigidus on September 5-6, 394 CE, when he defeated the western usurper Eugenius and his general Arbogast.[^36] This victory, aided by Gothic foederati led by Alaric and reportedly by a favorable wind known as the Bora that disrupted the enemy's lines, made Theodosius the sole ruler of the entire Roman Empire for the final months of his reign.[^37]

### Suppression of Paganism

Between 389 and 391, Theodosius issued the "Theodosian decrees," which established what many historians describe as a practical ban on paganism.[^38] These laws prohibited visits to pagan temples, abolished the remaining pagan holidays, extinguished the sacred fire in the Temple of Vesta in the Roman Forum, disbanded the Vestal Virgins, and deemed traditional practices like auspices and animal sacrifice punishable offenses.[^39] In 391, he decreed "no one is to go to the sanctuaries, walk through the temples, or raise his eyes to statues created by the labor of man."[^40]

In 388, Theodosius sent a prefect to Syria, Egypt, and Asia Minor with the aim of breaking up pagan associations and destroying their temples, during which campaign the famous Serapeum of Alexandria was demolished.[^41] However, modern historians have reassessed the practical impact of these laws, with scholars like Lepelly, Brown, and Cameron arguing that the Theodosian Code documents "Christian ambition" rather than historic reality, noting that archaeological evidence does not support the level of violent persecution expected from the laws.[^42] Some scholars now think there is little evidence Theodosius pursued an active and sustained policy against traditional cults, suggesting that local implementation varied considerably.[^43]

### Cultural Renaissance

Despite his reputation for religious intolerance, Theodosius is credited with presiding over a revival in classical art that historians have termed a "Theodosian renaissance."[^44] This cultural flowering saw continued imperial patronage of traditional Roman artistic forms and architectural projects, demonstrating that even as official religious policy shifted toward Christianity, classical Roman cultural traditions maintained vitality and imperial support.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Massacre of Thessalonica

The single most damning episode of Theodosius's reign occurred in 390 CE at Thessalonica, and it has stained historical assessments of his character for centuries.[^45] The incident began when Butheric, a Roman garrison commander, arrested a popular charioteer for alleged pederasty and refused demands for his release. An enraged mob lynched Butheric in response.[^46] Theodosius, informed of this affront to imperial authority, ordered a punitive response. What followed was a horrific massacre when imperial Gothic troops were unleashed on civilians gathered in the city's hippodrome, resulting in approximately 7,000 men, women, and children being slaughtered in three hours.[^47]

The chief problem confronting modern historians is the absurdity of such a measure against a civilian population, with scholarly debate continuing over whether Theodosius directly ordered the massacre, permitted it, or whether the troops simply lost control.[^48] Most scholars agree that Emperor Theodosius played at least some role in either ordering or permitting the massacre, though details remain murky since there are no contemporaneous accounts, with fifth-century church historians providing the earliest records.[^49]

The massacre provoked a remarkable confrontation with ecclesiastical authority. Bishop Ambrose of Milan withdrew in horror from the emperor's court, denounced Theodosius's wickedness, and wrote a letter stating the emperor needed to demonstrate public repentance and would be forbidden from receiving the Eucharist until he had done so.[^50] The emperor complied and underwent an eight-month public penance, being readmitted to communion on Christmas Day 390 after appearing in church without his imperial robes.[^51] According to historian Henry Smith Williams, history's assessment of Theodosius's character has been permanently stained by this "inhuman massacre," describing the emperor as "hasty and choleric" despite being otherwise virtuous-minded and courageous.[^52]

### Religious Intolerance and Persecution

While Christian historians praised Theodosius for establishing orthodoxy, modern critics emphasize the principle of religious intolerance proclaimed in his edicts.[^53] His laws against Arianism mandated adherence to the Nicene Creed, declaring any deviation from this doctrine as heretical and subject to civil penalties including confiscation of property, exile, and social marginalization.[^54] He expelled the Homoian bishop Demophilus from Constantinople just two days after arriving in the capital in November 380, and in 381 he forbade heretics to meet within cities and ordered all church buildings returned to Catholics.[^55]

Critics argue that these policies went against Christian teachings to love one's neighbor and established two dangerous enduring principles: religious persecution and the state church.[^56] Theodosius ended Rome's traditional religious toleration when he decreed the Nicene-Catholic form of Christianity to be the official religion of the state and made liable to harsh penalties of law all who did not accept it.[^57] When his initial efforts at enforcing orthodoxy proved insufficient, he promulgated even stronger laws in 383 and 384 renewing and strengthening measures against heretics.[^58]

### Dynastic Ambitions and Civil Wars

Theodosius stands accused of allowing his dynastic interests and ambitions to lead him into two unnecessary and bloody civil wars that severely weakened the empire's ability to defend itself against continued barbarian pressure on its frontiers.[^59] His conflicts with Magnus Maximus (383-388) and Eugenius (392-394), while victorious, diverted military resources from frontier defense and resulted in significant Roman casualties. Critics argue he put the interests of his family before those of the wider Roman population and was responsible, in many ways, for phenomena that contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire.[^60]

### The Gothic Settlement

Theodosius's treaty with the Goths in 382 CE remains one of the most controversial aspects of his reign. Some historians have regarded Theodosius as biased in favor of the Goths and have accused him of contributing decisively, through this treaty, to the downfall of Rome.[^61] Many of his contemporaries criticized the arrangement, and modern scholars have suggested it was a factor in the eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire.[^62] Although his pacification of the Goths secured peace during his lifetime, their status as an autonomous entity within Roman borders—maintaining their own leaders, laws, and military formations—caused serious problems for succeeding emperors.[^63] The precedent of settling large groups of armed barbarians within imperial territory with minimal integration would be repeated with increasingly destabilizing consequences.

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Family

Around 376 CE, during his retreat to civilian life in Spain following his father's execution, Theodosius married Aelia Flaccilla, a woman of Spanish descent like himself.[^64] When Theodosius became emperor in 379, Flaccilla became Roman empress and was given the title Augusta.[^65] She proved to be a fervent supporter of the Nicene Creed and once intervened to prevent a conference between Theodosius and Eunomius of Cyzicus, fearing her husband might be persuaded to betray the Nicene faith.[^66]

Flaccilla gave birth to three children: Arcadius (born c. 377), who would later become Emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire; Pulcheria (c. 376-385), who died in early childhood shortly before her mother; and Honorius (born September 9, 384), who would later become Emperor of the Western Roman Empire.[^67] Aelia Flaccilla died around 385 or 386 CE at Scotumis in Thrace and was buried at Constantinople, with her funeral oration delivered by Gregory of Nyssa.[^68]

After Flaccilla's death, Theodosius married Galla in 387, who died in childbirth in 394.[^69] With Galla, Theodosius had a son Gratian (born 388) who died young, and a daughter Aelia Galla Placidia (392-450), who would play a significant role in Western Roman politics during the following generation.[^70] The division of the empire between his sons Arcadius and Honorius upon his death in 395 would prove permanent, though this was not Theodosius's intention when he made the arrangement.[^71]

### Character and Personality

Historical sources paint a complex picture of Theodosius's personality. One historian noted that this son of an emperor executed for high treason "veered disconcertingly between opposites—febrile activity and indolent sluggishness, a simple soldierly life and the splendors of the court."[^72] He was described as hasty and choleric in temperament, capable of both terrible violence (as at Thessalonica) and merciful clemency (as when he pardoned the citizens of Antioch after a similar uprising).[^73] Despite his lack of extensive education, he maintained an intellectual curiosity, particularly regarding history, and sought to apply historical lessons to contemporary governance.[^74]

His relationship with ecclesiastical authorities, particularly Bishop Ambrose of Milan, demonstrated both his piety and his willingness to submit to church discipline when necessary.[^75] The fact that he underwent eight months of public penance for the Thessalonica massacre suggests genuine religious conviction, or at least recognition of the church's growing authority in imperial affairs. His two marriages both produced heirs, indicating he took his dynastic responsibilities seriously, and his decision to divide the empire between his sons reflected traditional Roman practices of collegial rule, even if the consequences proved detrimental to imperial unity.[^76]

## Legacy

### The Permanent Division of the Roman Empire

Theodosius I's most consequential legacy was his role as the last emperor to rule the entire Roman Empire.[^77] Upon his death on January 17, 395 CE, he divided the empire between his two young sons: Arcadius, who was given control of the Eastern Roman Empire, and ten-year-old Honorius, who took over the Western Roman Empire.[^78] While divisions of the Roman Empire had occurred before and Theodosius likely did not intend the partition to be permanent, the empire would never again be fully reunited.[^79] This division established the framework for the Byzantine Empire in the East, which would endure for another thousand years, while the Western Empire would collapse within a century under barbarian invasions and internal weakness.

The rule of the Theodosian dynasty saw the final East-West division that would define European history for centuries.[^80] The fact that his two sons proved weak and incapable rulers who presided over a period marked by foreign invasions and court intrigues seriously weakened both empires, making the division's negative consequences more severe than they might otherwise have been.[^81]

### Religious Transformation of Europe

Theodosius won two civil wars and was instrumental in establishing the Nicene Creed as the orthodox doctrine for Nicene Christianity, fundamentally shaping the religious character of Europe and the Near East for centuries.[^82] In 391, he declared Christianity as the only legitimate imperial religion, ending state support for the traditional Roman religion.[^83] Theodosius helped ensure that Christianity was the Empire's unchallenged religion, a transformation that would define European civilization.[^84]

However, in establishing state-sponsored Christianity, he also pioneered the concept of religious persecution backed by imperial authority and created the model of the state church that would be replicated throughout medieval and early modern Europe.[^85] This dual legacy—establishing Christian dominance while also establishing the precedent for religious coercion—remains central to assessments of his historical impact.

### The Gothic Problem

Although Theodosius's treaty with the Goths in 382 secured peace for the Empire during his lifetime, their status as an autonomous entity within Roman borders caused serious problems for succeeding emperors.[^86] The precedent of allowing armed barbarian groups to settle within imperial territory while maintaining their own leadership and military structure would be repeated with increasingly destabilizing effects. The very Gothic foederati who fought for Theodosius at the Battle of the Frigidus under Alaric's command would, within fifteen years of the emperor's death, sack Rome itself in 410 CE under that same Alaric.[^87]

### Cultural Contributions

On a more positive note, Theodosius is credited with presiding over a "Theodosian renaissance" in classical art and culture, demonstrating that Christian imperial rule did not necessarily mean the complete abandonment of classical Roman traditions.[^88] His reign saw continued patronage of the arts, architecture, and learning, even as official religious policy shifted dramatically toward Christianity.

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Traditional Christian historians and ecclesiastical sources have consistently praised Theodosius as a champion of orthodoxy who saved the empire from heresy and established the church's dominant position. The Catholic Encyclopedia describes him as having "loved and practised the virtues of domestic life" and credits him with wisdom in lawmaking and military success that rendered his administration "respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies."[^89]

Historian Edward Gibbon, despite his generally critical view of Christianity's impact on Rome, acknowledged that Theodosius's "character might furnish the subject of a sincere and ample panegyric," noting his practice of domestic virtues and his administrative competence.[^90] Supporters emphasize his military victories, his success in stabilizing the empire after the disaster of Adrianople, his cultural patronage, and his genuine piety demonstrated by his submission to ecclesiastical penance after Thessalonica.[^91]

From a Christian theological perspective, his establishment of Nicene orthodoxy is viewed as providential, preserving what believers consider correct Christian doctrine against various heresies. His summoning of the Council of Constantinople in 381 is recognized as a crucial moment in defining Christian theology, particularly regarding the Holy Spirit's divinity.[^92] Orthodox and Catholic traditions have generally venerated him as "Theodosius the Great," emphasizing his role in establishing the institutional church's position in society.[^93]

Defenders also note that while his anti-pagan legislation appears severe in modern terms, it must be understood in the context of fourth-century norms and that archaeological evidence suggests actual enforcement was less systematic and violent than the legal texts might imply.[^94] Some scholars argue that the transition from paganism to Christianity under Theodosius was more gradual and less coercive than previously thought, with many pagan practices continuing in modified forms.[^95]

### Negative Views

Modern critical historians emphasize the darker aspects of Theodosius's legacy, particularly the establishment of religious intolerance as imperial policy. Critics point out that his religious laws ended Rome's centuries-long tradition of religious pluralism and established dangerous precedents for state-sponsored persecution.[^96] The principle that rulers should enforce religious uniformity and punish dissent would have devastating consequences throughout European history, from medieval inquisitions to early modern religious wars.[^97]

The Massacre of Thessalonica remains an indelible stain on his reputation, with historian Henry Smith Williams noting that this single atrocity has colored historical assessments of Theodosius's character for centuries.[^98] Critics emphasize the hypocrisy of a Christian emperor who preached charity while ordering the massacre of thousands of unarmed civilians, and they question whether his subsequent penance was genuine contrition or merely political theater.[^99]

His Gothic policy receives particular criticism from those who see it as a contributing factor to Rome's eventual fall. By granting the Goths autonomous status within imperial borders, Theodosius established a precedent that would be repeated with increasingly destabilizing effects.[^100] Critics argue that he prioritized short-term peace over long-term imperial security, creating a situation where armed barbarian groups could operate within Roman territory while maintaining their own political structures and allegiances.[^101]

His two civil wars against Magnus Maximus and Eugenius are viewed by many historians as unnecessary conflicts driven by dynastic ambition rather than imperial necessity.[^102] These wars diverted resources from frontier defense, killed large numbers of Roman soldiers, and weakened the empire's ability to respond to external threats—all to secure power for Theodosius's family rather than for the good of the state.[^103]

The permanent division of the empire between his weak sons is seen as a catastrophic failure of succession planning.[^104] While Theodosius could not have foreseen all the consequences, critics argue that elevating his incompetent sons to imperial rank and dividing the empire between them demonstrated poor judgment and prioritization of family over state interests.[^105] The fact that both Arcadius and Honorius proved incapable rulers who presided over imperial decline validates these criticisms.[^106]

Finally, revisionist historians challenge the traditional narrative that Theodosius single-handedly Christianized the empire, arguing instead that he was riding a wave of Christian growth that was already well advanced and that Christian writers of the fifth century exaggerated his role to create a narrative of imperial piety rather than accurately recording historical reality.[^107] These scholars emphasize that in the centuries after his death, Theodosius was regarded as a champion of Christian orthodoxy who decisively stamped out paganism, but modern scholarship tends to see this as interpretation by Christian writers rather than accurate representation of actual history.[^108]
