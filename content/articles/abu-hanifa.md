## Summary

Abu Hanifa was an Islamic jurist and theologian who founded the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, the largest of the four Sunni madhhabs. He emphasized the use of analogical reasoning (qiyas) and juristic preference (istihsan) in Islamic law. His approach to jurisprudence was more flexible and rationalist than other schools. He was imprisoned for refusing to serve as chief judge under the Abbasids and died in prison.
