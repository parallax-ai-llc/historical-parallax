## Summary

The Falcon Lake incident is Canada's most famous UFO case. Amateur geologist **Stefan Michalak** was prospecting for quartz when he saw two cigar-shaped objects land. He approached one, thinking it was a secret US military craft.

When he touched it, his glove melted. The craft then blasted him with hot gas from a vent, setting his shirt on fire and leaving a permanent **grid-pattern burn** on his chest. He suffered from symptoms consistent with radiation sickness for months. The Royal Canadian Mint even issued a glow-in-the-dark coin in 2018 to commemorate the event.[^1]

## The Encounter

### The Evidence

- **Burns:** Doctors confirmed the geometric grid burns on his chest.
- **Radiation:** Soil samples from the site were found to be radioactive.
- **Metals:** Years later, pieces of radioactive silver were found melted into the rock fissures at the site.

### Skepticism

Critics claimed Michalak hallucinated from alcohol or staged it, but the physical burns and the radioactive site (confirmed by the RCMP) make it hard to dismiss.
