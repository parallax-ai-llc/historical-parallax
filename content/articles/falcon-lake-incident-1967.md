## Overview

The Falcon Lake Incident is widely regarded as Canada's best-documented UFO case because it involved not just a reliable witness, but actual **physical injury** and **radioactive evidence**.
**Stefan Michalak**, a 51-year-old industrial mechanic and amateur geologist, was prospecting for silver near Falcon Lake when he encountered two saucer-shaped craft.

## The Encounter

Michalak saw two cigar-shaped objects descending. One landed on a flat rock about 160 feet away; the other flew off.
Thinking it was a secret US experimental craft, he approached it.
**Sensory Details:**
- He heard a whirring sound and smelled sulfur/burning electronics.
- He saw purple lights and a hatch open.
- He heard "muffled voices" inside. He called out in English, Russian, and German, asking if they needed help. No answer.

## The Attack

As he touched the craft (he said it felt like hot glass), the hatch slammed shut.
The craft began to rotate. A grid-like exhaust vent blasted him with a burst of hot gas.
His shirt caught fire. He ripped it off.
The craft shot up into the sky and vanished.

## The Evidence

**The Burns:**
Michalak was treated at a hospital for severe burns on his chest and stomach. The burns were in a distinct **grid pattern** (matching the exhaust vent he described).
He suffered from symptoms of radiation sickness (nausea, weight loss, blackouts) for weeks.
**The Site:**
Investigators from the RCMP and the Royal Canadian Air Force visited the site.
They found a circle of superheated/dried vegetation.
More importantly, they found **radioactive soil samples** and pieces of radioactive silver metal at the landing site.

## Skeptics vs Believers

Skeptics claimed he burned himself with a barbecue grill to fake it.
However, Michalak never sought money or fame. He was a sober, hardworking family man. The Mayo Clinic even examined him and confirmed he was sane.
The Canadian government's official report admitted the case was "unexplained."
