## Summary

Tomoko Ohta is a Japanese evolutionary biologist who developed the nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution, a refinement of Motoo Kimura's neutral theory. Her theory proposes that slightly deleterious mutations, rather than strictly neutral ones, play a major role in evolution. This model better explains observed patterns of molecular evolution.
