## Summary

G. N. Ramachandran developed the Ramachandran plot, a fundamental tool in structural biology that maps the allowed conformations of protein backbone angles. His work on the triple-helical structure of collagen was a landmark in protein chemistry. The Ramachandran plot remains essential for validating protein structures determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR.
