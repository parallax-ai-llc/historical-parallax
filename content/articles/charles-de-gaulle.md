## Summary

Charles de Gaulle (1890-1970) was a French general, statesman, and political leader who led the Free French Forces during World War II and later served as President of France from 1959 to 1969. He founded the Fifth Republic, established France's independent foreign policy stance, and became a symbol of French resistance against Nazi occupation. His political philosophy, known as Gaullism, emphasized national independence, strong executive leadership, and French grandeur on the world stage.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle was born on November 22, 1890, in Lille, France, the third of five children in a Roman Catholic, patriotic, and nationalist upper-middle-class family.[^3] His father, Henri de Gaulle, was a professor of philosophy and literature who instilled in young Charles a deep appreciation for French history and culture. His mother, Jeanne Maillot-Delannoy, shared stories of France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, tales that profoundly affected the young boy and shaped his lifelong devotion to France's honor and independence.[^4]

Growing up in a household steeped in intellectual and patriotic traditions, de Gaulle developed an early fascination with military history and strategy. He spent hours reading his father's extensive library and reenacting famous French military battles. At age 11, his family moved to Paris, where he attended the prestigious Collège Stanislas, a Catholic private school.[^5] The young de Gaulle was not initially an outstanding student, but from his mid-teens onward, he focused intensely on preparing for entrance to France's elite military academy.

In 1908, after one year of preparatory studies, de Gaulle was admitted to the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, France's premier institution for training army officers.[^6] His performance at Saint-Cyr was respectable but not exceptional—he ranked 119th out of 221 in his entry class. However, by the time he graduated in 1912, he had risen to 13th place out of 210 cadets. His final report noted that he was "a highly gifted cadet who should go on to make an excellent officer."[^7] This assessment would prove prophetic, though few could have imagined the extraordinary role he would play in France's destiny.

Upon graduation in 1912, the young Second Lieutenant de Gaulle joined the 33rd Infantry Regiment at Arras, commanded by Colonel Philippe Pétain, who would become both a mentor and later a bitter adversary.[^8] The experience under Pétain's command deeply influenced de Gaulle's understanding of military leadership, discipline, and the importance of morale. Little did either man know that their paths would diverge dramatically during France's darkest hour in 1940, when Pétain would choose collaboration with Nazi Germany while de Gaulle chose resistance.

## Rise to Power

De Gaulle's rise to prominence began during World War I, though it was marked more by suffering than glory. When war broke out in 1914, Captain de Gaulle distinguished himself through exceptional bravery in combat.[^9] He was wounded three times in battle and mentioned three times in military dispatches for valor. However, his wartime career was cut short in March 1916 during the Battle of Verdun, when he was bayoneted in the thigh and left for dead on the battlefield. Regaining consciousness in German hands, he spent the next two years and eight months as a prisoner of war.[^10]

During his captivity, the restless and intellectually curious de Gaulle made five escape attempts, all unsuccessful. He spent his time in prison camps reading voraciously, learning German, and lecturing fellow prisoners on military history and strategy.[^11] This period of forced reflection shaped his thinking about warfare, national will, and the relationship between military force and political purpose. He also developed a lifelong contempt for defeatism, having witnessed firsthand how France's initial setbacks in 1914 had been overcome through perseverance.

The interwar period saw de Gaulle develop into an innovative military theorist and writer. In 1925, Marshal Pétain appointed him to the staff of the Supreme War Council, where he began writing about military doctrine and strategy.[^12] His most important work, "Vers l'Armée de Métier" (Towards a Professional Army), published in 1934, advocated for the mechanization of the French military with an emphasis on mobile armored divisions of tanks and mechanized infantry.[^13] This prescient vision anticipated the very blitzkrieg tactics that Germany would use to devastating effect in 1940. Tragically, French military and political leaders largely ignored de Gaulle's warnings, preferring to invest in the static fortifications of the Maginot Line.

When World War II erupted and France faced German invasion in May 1940, de Gaulle finally received an opportunity to implement his theories. As a newly promoted Brigadier General, he commanded the 4th Armored Division and led one of the few successful French counterattacks against German forces at Montcornet on May 17, 1940.[^14] This limited tactical success brought him to the attention of Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, who appointed him Undersecretary of State for National Defense and War on June 6, 1940—the youngest general in the French Army suddenly found himself in government at France's moment of greatest peril.

However, the military situation was hopeless. When Marshal Pétain and the majority of the French government decided to seek an armistice with Germany, de Gaulle made a fateful choice. On June 16, 1940, learning of the impending surrender, he boarded a British plane to London.[^15] The next day, France requested an armistice. On June 18, 1940, using a BBC microphone, de Gaulle broadcast his historic Appeal to the French people, declaring that "France has lost a battle, but France has not lost the war" and calling on all Free French to continue the resistance.[^16] This moment marked his transformation from obscure general to symbol of French defiance.

## Major Achievements

De Gaulle's leadership of Free France from London represented one of his greatest achievements. On June 28, 1940, the British government recognized him as "Leader of All Free Frenchmen," giving him a platform to organize resistance.[^17] Starting with almost nothing—a handful of followers, no territory, and questionable legitimacy—de Gaulle built the Free French Forces into a military and political movement that would ultimately field over 300,000 troops by the liberation of France in 1944.[^18]

His establishment of the French National Committee in London in September 1941 created a government-in-exile that represented the republican alternative to the collaborationist Vichy regime.[^19] Through skillful diplomacy, determination, and sheer force of personality, de Gaulle secured France's place among the victorious Allied powers despite the country's military defeat and occupation. He successfully unified the fractious internal French Resistance movements under his leadership, sending Jean Moulin to France in 1942 to coordinate the various groups.[^20] By May 1943, Moulin had established the National Resistance Council that federated all major resistance movements under de Gaulle's authority.

De Gaulle's insistence on French sovereignty and independence, even when France was weak and dependent on Allied support, established principles that would guide his later presidency. He clashed frequently with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin D. Roosevelt, both of whom found him difficult and ungrateful.[^21] Yet his obstinacy ensured that France would be treated as a great power, securing for France a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and an occupation zone in defeated Germany.

The liberation of Paris in August 1944 represented the culmination of de Gaulle's wartime leadership. On August 25, 1944, he entered Paris and delivered a famous speech at the Hôtel de Ville, declaring "Paris! Paris outraged! Paris broken! Paris martyred! But Paris liberated!"[^22] He became head of the Provisional Government of the French Republic, successfully managing France's transition from occupation to liberation while preventing civil war between communist and non-communist resistance factions.

De Gaulle's greatest political achievement came in 1958 when he returned from retirement to save France from civil war over Algeria. The May 13, 1958 Algiers putsch by French military officers and settlers threatened to topple the Fourth Republic and potentially launch a coup in mainland France.[^23] President René Coty called upon de Gaulle as the only figure with sufficient authority to resolve the crisis. On June 1, 1958, de Gaulle became Prime Minister with emergency powers to draft a new constitution.[^24]

The Constitution of the Fifth Republic, approved by referendum on September 28, 1958 with 82.6% support, fundamentally restructured French government.[^25] It created a semi-presidential system with a strong executive presidency, replacing the unstable parliamentary system of the Fourth Republic that had cycled through governments with bewildering frequency. On December 21, 1958, de Gaulle was elected the first President of the Fifth Republic with 78% of the electoral college vote.[^26] This constitutional framework has endured to the present day, representing de Gaulle's most lasting domestic legacy.

As President, de Gaulle successfully ended the Algerian War, one of the most divisive issues in modern French history. Despite having come to power with the support of those who wanted to keep Algeria French, he pragmatically recognized that Algerian independence was inevitable.[^27] On July 3, 1962, Algeria became independent following a referendum. This decision required immense political courage, as it made him the target of the Organisation Armée Secrète (OAS), which attempted to assassinate him more than twenty times, most famously in the August 22, 1962 ambush at Petit-Clamart.[^28]

De Gaulle's foreign policy achievements centered on restoring French independence and grandeur on the world stage. He launched an independent nuclear weapons program that made France the fourth nuclear power, providing strategic autonomy from American protection.[^29] His withdrawal of France from NATO's integrated military command structure in 1966, while remaining in the alliance politically, asserted France's right to independent defense policy and forced NATO headquarters to relocate from Paris to Brussels.[^30] He vetoed British entry into the European Economic Community in 1963 and again in 1967, fearing that Britain would serve as an American Trojan horse and overshadow France in European affairs.[^31]

## Controversies and Criticisms

De Gaulle's presidency was marked by significant controversies that generated both domestic opposition and international criticism. His authoritarian governing style and tendency to act unilaterally without consulting parliament or even his own ministers earned him accusations of monarchical pretensions.[^32] Critics labeled him a dictator in democratic clothing, pointing to his dismissive attitude toward parliamentary democracy and his consolidation of power in the presidency.

The Algerian War produced some of the darkest controversies of de Gaulle's career. While he ultimately granted Algeria independence, the path to that decision involved years of brutal conflict, torture, and human rights abuses by French forces.[^33] De Gaulle's shifting positions on Algeria—initially appearing to support "Algérie française" before pivoting toward independence—led to accusations of duplicity from both sides. The OAS's campaign of terrorism, motivated by fury at his "betrayal," resulted in numerous civilian casualties. De Gaulle's decision to grant amnesty to many OAS members remained controversial for decades.

The events of May 1968 severely challenged de Gaulle's authority and exposed generational and social tensions in French society. Student protests against the rigid, conservative, and hierarchical nature of French universities spread to general strikes involving up to 10 million workers at their peak.[^34] De Gaulle's initial response was dismissive, and his government's handling of the crisis revealed an administration out of touch with changing social mores. The protests represented rejection not just of government policies but of the entire Gaullist vision of France as hierarchical, traditional, and patriarchal.[^35]

De Gaulle's foreign policy generated substantial international criticism. His withdrawal from NATO's military command structure in 1966 was viewed by allies as dangerously undermining Western unity during the Cold War.[^36] His veto of British entry into the European Economic Community was seen as petty nationalism that harmed European integration. His 1967 speech in Montreal declaring "Vive le Québec libre!" (Long live free Quebec!) interfered in Canadian internal affairs and created a diplomatic incident with a close ally.[^37]

His domestic media policy also drew criticism. While France had a free press and democratic elections, the state broadcasting monopoly ORTF (Office de Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française) gave the government direct influence over television and radio news, leading to accusations of propaganda and censorship.[^38] The government's 100% male composition until 1968 reflected a deeply patriarchal approach that excluded women from political power despite France's universal suffrage.[^39]

De Gaulle's economic policy of dirigisme (state direction of the economy) had mixed results. While France experienced strong economic growth during the "Trente Glorieuses" (Thirty Glorious Years) of postwar expansion, critics argued that state intervention created inefficiencies and protected uncompetitive industries.[^40] His pursuit of national champions and resistance to economic liberalization sometimes prioritized prestige over economic rationality.

His Middle East policy shift after the 1967 Six-Day War generated particular controversy. De Gaulle imposed an arms embargo on Israel, reversing France's previously close relationship with the Jewish state, and described Jews as "an elite people, self-assured and domineering," comments that were widely criticized as antisemitic.[^41] This policy realignment toward Arab states was seen as motivated by commercial interests in oil and arms sales rather than principles.

## Personal Life

Charles de Gaulle married Yvonne Vendroux on April 7, 1921, in a ceremony at Église Notre-Dame in Calais.[^42] Their marriage would last nearly five decades until his death, characterized by deep mutual devotion and traditional Catholic values. Yvonne, from a prosperous bourgeois family of biscuit manufacturers, provided Charles with unwavering support throughout his tumultuous career, managing the household and shielding their private life from public scrutiny. She was known for her discretion, piety, and dedication to family, in stark contrast to her husband's very public role.

The couple had three children: Philippe (1921-2024), Élisabeth (1924-2013), and Anne (1928-1948).[^43] The birth of their youngest daughter Anne in 1928 in Trier, Germany, where de Gaulle was stationed, brought profound challenges and transformation to the family. Within months of her birth, it became clear that Anne suffered from Down syndrome.[^44] In an era when institutionalizing such children was standard practice, Charles and Yvonne de Gaulle made the then-radical decision to raise Anne at home, insisting "God has given her to us. We must take responsibility for her."[^45]

Anne's presence transformed de Gaulle's personal life in profound ways. The normally austere, formal, and emotionally reserved general was openly affectionate and demonstrative with Anne in ways he never was with others. He would entertain her with songs, dances, and pantomimes, behaviors his staff found astonishing from such a dignified figure.[^46] Colleagues and family members testified that Anne brought out a tenderness in de Gaulle that was otherwise hidden behind his imposing public persona.

The death of Anne on February 6, 1948, at age 20, devastated both Charles and Yvonne. She died in her father's arms at their home in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises.[^47] After her burial in the village cemetery, Charles told his weeping wife "Maintenant, elle est comme les autres" (Now she is like all the others)—expressing both sorrow and a father's consoling belief that his daughter had finally found peace and equality in death.[^48] In Anne's memory, Charles and Yvonne founded the Anne de Gaulle Foundation at the Château de Vert-Cœur to help children with disabilities, a cause to which they devoted significant personal attention and resources.[^49]

De Gaulle later reflected that Anne had taught him profound lessons about human dignity beyond worldly success, stating that she had helped him "overcome the failures" and "look beyond the honors" that marked his public career.[^50] Friends and family noted that his experience as Anne's father gave him empathy and humility that balanced his otherwise domineering personality.

Throughout his life, de Gaulle maintained a disciplined personal routine. He was an voracious reader with particular interests in history, philosophy, and classical literature. He wrote several influential books, including his war memoirs and his comprehensive "Mémoires de Guerre" published in three volumes between 1954 and 1959.[^51] His literary style was elegant, classical, and often compared to that of great French writers, earning him respect as an author independent of his political achievements.

De Gaulle's personality was complex and often contradictory. Publicly, he projected an image of aloof grandeur, formal dignity, and supreme self-confidence bordering on arrogance. He stood 6 feet 5 inches tall (1.96 meters), an imposing physical presence that reinforced his commanding personality.[^52] Yet those close to him knew a man capable of warmth, humor, and even self-deprecating wit. He could be both visionary and pragmatic, romantic and calculating, generous and vindictive.

His retreat at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises, a modest country estate called La Boisserie, represented an essential refuge from public life. There he would walk his property, read, write, and spend time with family.[^53] The simple, almost austere character of La Boisserie reflected his personal tastes—despite his grand vision for France, his own lifestyle was relatively modest and traditional. He refused significant wealth and rejected many of the perquisites of power, maintaining that public service was its own reward.

## Legacy

Charles de Gaulle's death on November 9, 1970, at Colombey-les-Deux-Églises marked the end of an era, but his influence on France and global politics has endured for more than half a century.[^54] He is widely considered the greatest Frenchman of the twentieth century, a figure whose impact on France's political institutions, foreign policy orientation, and national self-conception cannot be overstated.[^55]

The Fifth Republic's constitutional framework remains de Gaulle's most tangible domestic legacy. The strong presidency he designed has been maintained by all his successors, including socialists like François Mitterrand (1981-1995) who had opposed the system's creation.[^56] Ideas once controversial when de Gaulle promoted them—such as presidential authority over parliament, direct election of the president (instituted in 1962), and the possibility of referendums—have become accepted as normal features of French democracy. As scholars note, these "once-controversial Gaullist ideas have become accepted as part of the French political consensus and are no longer the focus of political controversy."[^57]

Gaullism as a political philosophy and movement has profoundly shaped French political culture. While not a rigid ideology, Gaullism emphasizes national independence, state sovereignty, rejection of subordination to foreign powers, strong executive leadership, and the pursuit of French "grandeur" on the world stage.[^58] Scholars describe it as "neither a doctrine nor a political ideology" and note it "cannot be considered either left or right," but its influence spans the entire French political spectrum.[^59] During the 2017 presidential election, candidates from the radical left (Jean-Luc Mélenchon) to the radical right (Marine Le Pen), as well as centrists (Emmanuel Macron) and conservatives (François Fillon), all claimed de Gaulle's legacy.[^60]

France's independent foreign policy and nuclear deterrent, cornerstones of de Gaulle's vision, remain central to French strategic thinking. Every French president has maintained the independent nuclear force de frappe, and French foreign policy continues to be influenced by Gaullist principles of national autonomy, even if "expressed in more flexible terms."[^61] France's permanent seat on the UN Security Council, its activist diplomatic stance, and its willingness to chart courses independent of allies all reflect Gaullist inheritance.

However, not all Gaullist policies have endured unchanged. France returned to NATO's integrated military command structure in 2009 under President Nicolas Sarkozy, formally ending the Gaullist estrangement from the alliance.[^62] De Gaulle's economic policy of dirigisme has weakened considerably, with French governments privatizing many state assets since the mid-1980s and embracing greater economic liberalization within the European Union framework.[^63] The European integration project has also advanced far beyond what de Gaulle envisioned, with France accepting supranational institutions and shared sovereignty that he would have rejected.

Internationally, de Gaulle's legacy is more contested. To admirers, he represents principled independence, national dignity, and resistance to hegemonic power—values that resonate particularly in the developing world and among those skeptical of American global dominance.[^64] His support for Quebec's autonomy, recognition of Communist China, criticism of American policy in Vietnam, and cultivation of relationships with the Soviet Union and Third World countries established France as a power willing to challenge Cold War bipolarity. This independent stance created diplomatic space for medium powers and influenced the Non-Aligned Movement.

To critics, de Gaulle's legacy includes harmful nationalism, obstruction of European integration, and prioritization of French prestige over collective Western interests during the Cold War.[^65] His veto of British EEC membership delayed Britain's entry for a decade and reflected a narrow nationalism that hindered European unity. His withdrawal from NATO's military command created unnecessary complications for Western defense cooperation at a critical time.

Cultural memory of de Gaulle remains powerful in France. His image—the tall, imposing figure in military uniform or civilian suit, often photographed with arms raised in his characteristic V-for-Victory gesture—has become iconic.[^66] Countless streets, squares, airports, and institutions bear his name, including Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport, the world's second-busiest airport in Europe. The Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, France's flagship, represents both military and symbolic continuation of his legacy of French power projection.

Academic scholarship on de Gaulle continues to produce new interpretations and assessments. While no comprehensive scholarly synthesis of his historical significance exists, conferences, edited volumes, and specialized studies continually examine aspects of his leadership, policies, and impact.[^67] Archival releases have enabled more nuanced understanding of his decision-making processes, relationships with allies and adversaries, and the gap between his public rhetoric and private pragmatism.

Perhaps de Gaulle's most enduring legacy is his restoration of French national confidence after the trauma of defeat and occupation. He gave France a narrative of resistance rather than collaboration, providing a usable past that enabled national healing and forward movement.[^68] While this narrative obscured the complexity of French behavior during occupation—the extent of collaboration, the limited nature of resistance—it served the essential purpose of national reconciliation and reconstruction of French identity as a victor rather than a victim.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders of de Gaulle emphasize his essential role in saving France's honor during World War II and his prescient understanding of geopolitics and military technology. Historian Julian Jackson argues that de Gaulle's lonely stand in June 1940 represented extraordinary moral courage, transforming him from an obscure general into "the embodiment of French resistance" despite having no legitimate authority beyond force of personality and conviction.[^69] Academic assessments praise him for "symbolizing the Resistance, achieving reconciliation over collaboration wounds, and managing to have France end the war among the victors despite starting as an outcast."[^70]

Supporters credit de Gaulle with establishing political stability in France after decades of governmental instability. The Fourth Republic (1946-1958) had 24 governments in 12 years, while the Fifth Republic has provided stable executive leadership for over six decades.[^71] Constitutional scholars acknowledge that while the strong presidency carries risks of excessive executive power, it has prevented the parliamentary paralysis that plagued earlier French republics and has been successfully democratized through direct presidential elections and periods of cohabitation between presidents and prime ministers of opposing parties.

Foreign policy analysts admire de Gaulle's strategic vision and his understanding that the Cold War's bipolar structure would eventually give way to a multipolar world. His early recognition of Communist China (1964), criticism of American involvement in Vietnam, and cultivation of relations with the Soviet Union and developing countries anticipated the emergence of a more complex international system.[^72] Defenders argue that his assertiveness protected French interests and created diplomatic space for European independence from both superpowers.

Admirers emphasize de Gaulle's personal integrity, noting his refusal to enrich himself through political office, his modest lifestyle despite wielding great power, and his voluntary relinquishment of power in 1946 and 1969 when he felt he had lost public confidence.[^73] His 1969 resignation following defeat in a referendum on relatively minor constitutional reforms demonstrated his commitment to democratic legitimacy and rejection of power for its own sake—a striking contrast to many twentieth-century leaders.

Military historians praise de Gaulle's interwar writings on armored warfare as prescient and innovative, arguing that if French leaders had heeded his warnings about the need for mobile mechanized forces, the catastrophic defeat of 1940 might have been avoided or mitigated.[^74] His understanding of how tanks, aircraft, and mobile infantry could revolutionize warfare was well ahead of most French military thinking and comparable to the best strategic thought in Germany and Britain.

Biographers emphasize the personal sacrifices de Gaulle made for his vision of France. His decision to leave for London in June 1940 meant abandoning his elderly mother (who died shortly after without him seeing her again), accepting separation from his family under uncertain conditions, and risking condemnation as a traitor by the Vichy regime, which sentenced him to death in absentia.[^75] These personal costs, borne for the sake of principle when continuation of the fight seemed hopeless, demonstrate the depth of his commitment.

### Negative Views

Critics of de Gaulle challenge his historical importance and question whether his contributions justify the costs of his policies and personality. Scholar Andrew Moravcsik argues that de Gaulle's European policy was driven less by distinctive geopolitical vision than by "narrow economic interests" and that his grand rhetoric about European independence masked France's pursuit of commercial advantage through agricultural subsidies and protection of domestic industries.[^76]

Some historians argue that de Gaulle's narrative of widespread French resistance was mythological, obscuring the reality that most French people accommodated or collaborated with Vichy and the German occupation.[^77] This "Gaullist myth" of France as a nation of resisters, while politically useful for postwar reconciliation, delayed honest reckoning with Vichy collaboration and French participation in the Holocaust. The myth served de Gaulle's political purposes but distorted historical memory and delayed justice for victims of French collaboration.

Foreign policy critics contend that de Gaulle's pursuit of grandeur weakened Western unity during the Cold War and served his vanity more than French interests. His withdrawal from NATO's integrated command and his obstruction of British EEC entry "antagonized his allies in the EEC and Atlantic Alliance, working against the prevailing political atmosphere in the West, which was a general belief in interdependence and integration."[^78] These actions, critics argue, indulged French pride while undermining practical cooperation that better served Western security and European prosperity.

Domestic critics emphasize de Gaulle's authoritarian tendencies and his contempt for parliamentary democracy. His governing style concentrated power in the executive, marginalized parliament, and created what critics called a "Republican monarchy."[^79] The state broadcasting monopoly, while not eliminating free press, gave government disproportionate influence over public information. His occasional threats to bypass parliament through referendums and his cultivation of direct relationship with the people through plebiscitary democracy undermined representative institutions.

Scholars critical of de Gaulle's Algeria policy note the contradictions and costs of his approach. Having come to power in 1958 with military and settler support under the assumption he would keep Algeria French, his subsequent reversal toward independence involved political duplicity.[^80] The years between 1958 and 1962 saw continued brutal warfare, use of torture by French forces, and ultimately the violent upheaval of the pieds-noirs (French Algerian settlers), hundreds of thousands of whom were forced to flee to France in 1962. A more honest and direct path to Algerian independence, critics argue, might have reduced these human costs.

Raymond Aron, one of France's most distinguished twentieth-century intellectuals and initially a supporter of de Gaulle during the war, became "remarkably ambivalent" about de Gaulle's presidency, criticizing "the excesses of grandeur" in his politics.[^81] Aron and other liberal intellectuals worried that de Gaulle's personalization of power, his nationalist rhetoric, and his dismissal of intermediate institutions threatened pluralist democracy and modern liberalism.

Critics also note contradictions between de Gaulle's anti-imperialist rhetoric and French policy. While publicly championing decolonization and Third World independence, France maintained significant military presence in Africa, intervened repeatedly in former colonies' internal affairs, and supported authoritarian regimes when they served French interests.[^82] The gap between Gaullist rhetoric about national independence and France's continued neocolonial practices in Africa revealed hypocrisy in the Gaullist vision.

Economic historians question whether de Gaulle's dirigiste economic policies deserve credit for France's postwar prosperity or whether France succeeded despite rather than because of state intervention.[^83] The "Trente Glorieuses" (Thirty Glorious Years) of growth from 1945-1975 characterized all Western European economies regardless of the level of state intervention, suggesting that Marshall Plan aid, postwar reconstruction demand, and Europe-wide trade liberalization better explain growth than specifically Gaullist policies.
