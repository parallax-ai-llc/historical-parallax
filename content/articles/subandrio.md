## Summary

Subandrio (15 September 1914 – 3 July 2004) was an Indonesian physician-turned-politician who served as Foreign Minister (1957-1966) and First Deputy Prime Minister under President Sukarno.[^1] As the chief architect of Indonesia's left-wing foreign policy during the 1960s, he championed close ties with Communist China, orchestrated the successful West Irian campaign, and initiated the confrontational Konfrontasi policy against Malaysia.[^2] His career ended abruptly following the failed 30 September Movement of 1965, when he was sentenced to death on treason charges—later commuted to life imprisonment—spending 29 years in prison before his release in 1995.[^3] Subandrio remains one of Indonesia's most controversial political figures, remembered both as a skilled diplomat who advanced Indonesian sovereignty and as a polarizing ideologue whose policies alienated Western powers and contributed to the political crisis that ended the Sukarno era.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Subandrio was born on 15 September 1914 in Malang, East Java, into an aristocratic Javanese family.[^5] Born during the final years of Dutch colonial rule, he grew up in an environment marked by the tensions between traditional Indonesian culture and European colonial authority. His father held a position of some prominence in the colonial administrative hierarchy, which afforded young Subandrio access to Dutch-language education, a privilege reserved for the indigenous elite.[^6]

He attended a Dutch-language Hogere Burgerschool (HBS) in Malang, where he received a Western-style secondary education that would later prove instrumental in his diplomatic career.[^7] Following his secondary education, Subandrio enrolled at the Sekolah Tinggi Kedokteran Jakarta (School of Medicine Jakarta), then known by its Dutch acronym GHS (Geneeskundige Hogeschool), where he pursued medical studies in the capital.[^8] It was during his time as a medical student that Subandrio became politically active, joining the Indonesian independence movement that was gaining momentum throughout the Dutch East Indies in the 1930s.[^9]

In 1938, while still in medical school, Subandrio met Hurustiati, the daughter of the Regent of Pasuruan, who was also studying medicine.[^10] They married in 1939 or 1940, forming a partnership that would prove significant both personally and politically.[^11] Like Subandrio, Hurustiati came from an elite Javanese background and had been educated in Dutch-language schools, sharing her husband's nationalist convictions.[^12] Despite their strong nationalist beliefs, the couple notably continued to speak Dutch to one another throughout their lives, a testament to the complex cultural identity of Indonesia's educated elite during the colonial and early independence periods.[^13]

During World War II and the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies (1942-1945), Subandrio practiced medicine while secretly working with anti-Japanese resistance forces.[^14] During this period, he and Hurustiati operated a nursing clinic together in Semarang until 1946, providing medical care while navigating the dangerous political landscape of the occupation.[^15] The couple had their only child during this period, a son named Budojo.[^16] The wartime experience deepened Subandrio's nationalist commitment and brought him into the orbit of Sukarno and other independence leaders, setting the stage for his subsequent political career.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Following Indonesia's declaration of independence on 17 August 1945, Subandrio transitioned from medicine to diplomacy, becoming a strong supporter of President Sukarno.[^18] In 1947, as the new Indonesian Republic struggled for international recognition during the Indonesian National Revolution, Sukarno sent Subandrio to Europe as his special envoy, where he established an information office in London to promote the Indonesian cause.[^19] This assignment marked Subandrio's entry into the diplomatic arena that would define his career.

From 1947 to 1954, Subandrio served as Indonesia's first envoy to the United Kingdom, representing the fledgling republic at the Court of St. James.[^20] During this crucial period, he worked to gain British recognition and support for Indonesian independence, navigating the complex post-war international environment. His wife Hurustiati accompanied him to London, where she pursued postgraduate studies in anthropology at the London School of Economics while also supporting Indonesia's diplomatic mission.[^21] The couple became skilled at presenting Indonesian nationalism to Western audiences, with Subandrio delivering numerous speeches that were later collected in the volume "Indonesia on the March" (1959).[^22]

In 1954, following a significant shift in Indonesian foreign policy, Subandrio was appointed as Indonesia's first ambassador to the Soviet Union, arriving in Moscow after the long-awaited exchange of embassies between the USSR and Indonesia.[^23] During his tenure in Moscow from 1954 to 1956, Subandrio developed strong left-wing views, though he was never a member of the Communist Party as later alleged.[^24] He and Hurustiati became well-regarded by Soviet leadership and developed a personal friendship with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.[^25] This experience in Moscow significantly influenced Subandrio's worldview and his subsequent approach to Indonesian foreign policy, reinforcing his belief in non-alignment and Third World solidarity.

In 1956, President Sukarno recalled Subandrio to Jakarta, appointing him first as Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry.[^26] Shortly thereafter, on 29 December 1957, Sukarno appointed him Foreign Minister, a position he would hold for nearly nine years.[^27] In 1960, he was additionally made Second Deputy Prime Minister (later elevated to First Deputy Prime Minister), and in 1962 he was appointed Minister for Foreign Economic Relations, holding all three posts simultaneously.[^28] Crucially, Subandrio was also appointed head of the Central Intelligence Board (BPI - Badan Pusat Intelijen) in November 1959, giving him unprecedented control over Indonesia's intelligence apparatus.[^29] This concentration of power in foreign affairs, intelligence, and government administration made Subandrio the second most powerful man in Indonesia after Sukarno himself, positioning him as the chief architect of Indonesian foreign policy during the crucial 1960s period.

## Major Achievements

### The West Irian Campaign (1957-1962)

Subandrio's most significant diplomatic achievement was his successful campaign to secure Indonesian sovereignty over West Irian (now Papua), the western half of New Guinea that had remained under Dutch control after Indonesian independence.[^30] From the moment he became Foreign Minister in 1957, Subandrio made the West Irian issue his top priority, warning on 4 October 1957 that Indonesia would embark on "another cause" if the United Nations failed to bring about a solution favoring Indonesia.[^31]

Subandrio employed a sophisticated strategy combining diplomatic pressure with military brinkmanship. In 1962, Indonesian forces conducted incursions into the territory through paratroop drops and naval landings of guerrillas, which Subandrio coordinated with his diplomatic confrontation to pressure the Netherlands.[^32] Throughout 1962, Subandrio engaged in top-secret negotiations facilitated by U.S. diplomat Ellsworth Bunker, ultimately producing the New York Agreement signed on 15 August 1962, which Subandrio signed on behalf of Indonesia.[^33] The agreement provided for the transfer of West Irian from Dutch to UN administration, and subsequently to Indonesia on 1 May 1963.[^34]

Interestingly, Subandrio opposed certain elements of the agreement. He regarded UN supervision and organization of the eventual referendum as a "humiliation for Indonesia," and Indonesian UN representative Lambertus Nicodemus Palar openly admitted that Subandrio didn't want a plebiscite at all.[^35] Ultimately, Subandrio only agreed to the terms when the United States threatened to change its position in the negotiations, demonstrating his pragmatism when necessary.[^36] The successful resolution of the West Irian dispute stands as Subandrio's greatest diplomatic triumph, achieving a long-standing nationalist goal and significantly enhancing Indonesia's territorial integrity and international standing.[^37]

### Architect of Indonesia's Non-Aligned Foreign Policy

Subandrio was the principal architect and implementer of Indonesia's "active and independent" foreign policy doctrine, which emphasized non-alignment with major power blocs while pursuing pragmatic engagements to bolster national sovereignty and development.[^38] Though he was appointed Foreign Minister after the landmark 1955 Bandung Conference, Subandrio had contributed to its preparatory efforts and subsequently built upon its legacy throughout his tenure.[^39] He played a key role in implementing the principles that would lead to Indonesia's founding membership in the Non-Aligned Movement, formally established at the Belgrade Summit in 1961.[^40]

As Foreign Minister from 1957 to 1966, Subandrio championed Indonesia's engagement with other newly independent nations in Asia and Africa, positioning Indonesia as a leader of the Third World during the height of the Cold War.[^41] The Soviet Union highly praised Indonesia's refusal to join either Cold War bloc and supported Indonesia's non-alignment course during Subandrio's tenure.[^42] However, Subandrio's interpretation of non-alignment increasingly tilted toward the Communist bloc, particularly China, which created tensions with Western powers and within Indonesia's own military establishment.[^43]

### Development of Indonesia's Intelligence Apparatus

As head of the Central Intelligence Board (BPI) from November 1959, Subandrio presided over the development of Indonesia's modern intelligence apparatus.[^44] The BPI, formed through Government Regulation No. 8 of 1959, replaced the ineffective Intelligence Coordinating Body (BKI) and was given not only coordination authority but also the right to conduct intelligence operations.[^45] With headquarters at Jalan Madiun in Jakarta, the BPI under Subandrio became a powerful instrument of state policy.[^46]

However, Subandrio's leadership of the BPI proved controversial. From the 1960s until the beginning of the New Order, his influence on the organization was particularly strong, especially amidst internal conflict between left- and right-wing factions of the armed forces.[^47] The army established its own Psychological Center (PSiAD) specifically to balance Subandrio's BPI, which had absorbed many sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI).[^48] This politicization of intelligence would later contribute to allegations against Subandrio following the events of 1965.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Konfrontasi Policy Against Malaysia

On 20 January 1963, Subandrio announced that Indonesia would pursue a policy of Konfrontasi (Confrontation) with Malaysia, initiating an undeclared war that would last until 1966.[^50] The term "Confrontation" was coined by Subandrio himself, and he was the policy's chief architect and advocate.[^51] In explaining the policy, Subandrio declared that Indonesia could not but "adopt a policy of confrontation against Malaya" because they were "accomplices of neo-colonialists."[^52]

The Konfrontasi involved armed incursions into Malaysian territory, with the first recorded infiltration occurring on 12 April 1963 when Indonesian forces attacked a police station in Tebedu, Sarawak.[^53] The conflict included cross-border raids, sabotage operations, and bombing attacks, bringing Indonesia into direct conflict with British, Australian, and New Zealand forces defending Malaysia.[^54] The policy created immense hostility between Indonesia and Western powers, particularly the United States and United Kingdom, and severely damaged Indonesia's international standing.[^55]

Critics argued that Konfrontasi was a reckless policy that squandered Indonesia's diplomatic capital, drained resources, and isolated the nation internationally.[^56] Subandrio attempted to reassure American Ambassador Howard P. Jones that the confrontation policy was concerned with Malaya specifically, not all of Malaysia, and was a reaction to Malayan and British anti-Jakarta activity in 1958, but this distinction did little to mollify Western concerns.[^57] The policy finally ended on 11 August 1966, after Sukarno's fall from power, representing a complete reversal of Subandrio's foreign policy legacy.[^58]

### Alliance with Communist China

Subandrio's cultivation of close relations with the People's Republic of China became one of his most criticized policies.[^59] He visited Beijing in early January 1963 and met with Premier Zhou Enlai, who subsequently visited Indonesia in April 1965, meeting with Subandrio in Bogor on 20 April.[^60] During their discussions, Zhou Enlai outlined China's position on Vietnam and reassured Subandrio regarding Chinese preparedness for potential conflict.[^61]

In late January 1965, while Subandrio was visiting China, Zhou Enlai endorsed President Sukarno's proposal to create a "Fifth Force"—a people's militia that would be armed and trained alongside the conventional military forces.[^62] This proposal alarmed Indonesia's military leadership, who saw it as an attempt to arm communist sympathizers. During his 1966 trial, a nervous and often incoherent Subandrio admitted to a secret meeting with Zhou Enlai in January 1965 in which the Chinese Premier had offered weapons to arm 100,000 Indonesian workers and peasants.[^63]

Critics portrayed Subandrio as essentially pro-Communist, with students later depicting him in graffiti as a "Pekingese dog"—a reference to his perceived subservience to Communist China.[^64] The army established intelligence operations specifically to monitor and counter Subandrio's pro-China policies, reflecting deep suspicions about his loyalties.[^65] Subandrio preferred closer ties with China over the West, and this preference ultimately contributed to his downfall when the political winds shifted in 1965-1966.[^66]

### The Gilchrist Document Affair

On 5 July 1965, Subandrio publicly revealed what became known as the Gilchrist Document, allegedly found after demonstrators ransacked the British Embassy in Jakarta and sent anonymously to Subandrio by post.[^67] The document purported to expose a plot by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and a pro-Western "Council of Generals" within the Indonesian military to overthrow Sukarno.[^68] Subandrio used the document to justify increased vigilance against Western interference and to legitimize his intelligence operations.[^69]

However, the document's authenticity was immediately questioned. The U.S. Embassy in Cairo declared it a counterfeit, and the U.S. administration internally considered that Subandrio's own intelligence agency was behind the forgery.[^70] Evidence later emerged suggesting that Czechoslovakian intelligence, specifically Major Louda, provided the document to the Indonesian Ambassador in Prague, who had underground links with Louda's entourage.[^71] The Gilchrist Document affair became known as a "humiliation toward Indonesian intelligence" and raised serious questions about Subandrio's judgment and the integrity of his operations.[^72]

The document and the conspiratorial thinking it represented contributed to the poisoned political atmosphere in Indonesia during 1965, potentially setting the stage for the violent events that would follow.[^73] Critics later pointed to the Gilchrist affair as evidence of Subandrio's involvement in political manipulation and intelligence operations aimed at destabilizing Indonesia's military leadership.[^74]

## Personal Life

Subandrio married Hurustiati Subandrio (c. 1918-1974), whom he met in medical school in 1938.[^75] Hurustiati was the daughter of the Regent of Pasuruan and came from an elite Javanese background similar to Subandrio's.[^76] Both were politically active medical doctors who shared strong nationalist convictions.[^77] They married in 1939 or 1940 and had one son, Budojo, born during the Japanese occupation.[^78]

The couple's relationship was marked by intellectual partnership and shared political commitments. When Subandrio served as ambassador to the United Kingdom (1947-1954), Hurustiati accompanied him and pursued postgraduate studies in anthropology at the London School of Economics, later becoming an anthropologist and social activist in her own right.[^79] She also accompanied him during his posting to Moscow (1954-1956), where they became personal friends with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.[^80] An interesting detail about their relationship was that despite their strong Indonesian nationalism, Hurustiati and Subandrio spoke Dutch to one another and continued to do so even after Indonesian independence, revealing the complex cultural identity of Indonesia's educated elite.[^81]

Hurustiati developed her own distinguished career as a physician, anthropologist, politician, and social activist.[^82] She authored scholarly works including "Javanese Peasant Life: Villages in East Java," demonstrating her intellectual accomplishments.[^83] When Subandrio was arrested in March 1966, Hurustiati was apparently in Switzerland at the time.[^84] Unlike her husband, she did not become a political prisoner upon her return to Indonesia, though she was removed from her leadership positions.[^85] She died in Jakarta on 14 April 1974 at age 54, after a long illness, while Subandrio was still imprisoned.[^86] Her death occurred 21 years before Subandrio's release, meaning he endured most of his imprisonment without his life partner.

Little is known about Subandrio's personality beyond his public persona. At his 1966 trial, observers noted he appeared "so nervous that he often mumbled incoherently," a stark contrast to the "once-glib Subandrio" who had been known for his eloquence as Foreign Minister and diplomat.[^87] When sentenced to death, he stood "quietly and calmly" in the courtroom, displaying composure in the face of his fate.[^88] After his release in 1995, Subandrio attempted to rehabilitate his reputation, meeting with President Abdurrahman Wahid on 21 December 2000, though no formal rehabilitation was granted.[^89] He published his autobiography, "Kesaksianku" (My Testimony), in 2001, presenting his version of historical events.[^90]

## Legacy

Subandrio died on 3 July 2004 in Jakarta at the age of 90, having lived his final nine years in relative obscurity following his release from three decades of imprisonment.[^91] He was buried at Jeruk Purut public cemetery in South Jakarta later that day.[^92] His death received limited media attention, reflecting his marginalized status in post-Suharto Indonesia, where he remained a controversial and largely unrehabilitated figure.[^93]

Subandrio's legacy in Indonesian history remains deeply contested and reflects the broader unresolved debates about the Sukarno era, the events of 1965, and the transition to Suharto's New Order.[^94] During the New Order regime (1966-1998), Subandrio was systematically portrayed in official state narratives as a central figure in the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI)'s alleged conspiracy behind the 30 September Movement, depicted as an act of treason aimed at destabilizing the nation and imposing communist rule.[^95] This official narrative, taught in schools and reinforced through state media, cast Subandrio as a villain in Indonesian history, effectively airbrushing him out of any positive historical memory.[^96]

The successful West Irian campaign remains Subandrio's most enduring achievement, representing a legitimate triumph of Indonesian diplomacy that fulfilled a key nationalist aspiration.[^97] His role in establishing Indonesia as a leader of the Non-Aligned Movement and champion of the Third World also represents a significant contribution to Indonesian foreign policy traditions that persist to this day.[^98] Indonesia's continued commitment to an "active and independent" foreign policy and its role in regional and international organizations can be traced in part to the foundations Subandrio helped establish.[^99]

However, his confrontational policies toward Malaysia and the West, his cultivation of ties with Communist China, and his alleged involvement in the events leading to the 1965 crisis severely damaged Indonesia's international standing and contributed to the violent political upheaval that ended the Sukarno era.[^100] The Konfrontasi policy in particular is remembered as a costly and ultimately futile adventure that isolated Indonesia and wasted resources.[^101] His concentration of power as both Foreign Minister and intelligence chief created institutional conflicts that persisted long after his removal.[^102]

After the fall of Suharto's New Order in 1998, some Indonesian scholars and activists called for a reassessment of the 1965 events and the rehabilitation of figures like Subandrio.[^103] However, his attempted rehabilitation has been unsuccessful, and powerful elements within Indonesia's military and political establishment continue to oppose any revision of the New Order narrative.[^104] The fact that Sukarno, Hatta, and Subandrio remain "airbrushed out of history" in many official contexts demonstrates the continuing political sensitivity surrounding these figures.[^105]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Subandrio favorably emphasize his role as a skilled diplomat who successfully advanced Indonesian sovereignty and nationalist goals during a critical period.[^106] His achievement in securing West Irian through the 1962 New York Agreement is acknowledged even by critics as a genuine diplomatic success that fulfilled a key objective of Indonesian independence.[^107] Subandrio's tenure as Foreign Minister from 1957 to 1966 contributed significantly to Indonesia's successful diplomatic campaign for West Irian, culminating in the transfer of administrative control from the Netherlands to Indonesia.[^108]

Defenders of Subandrio point to the lack of credible evidence linking him directly to the 30 September Movement, noting that he was in Sumatra at the time of the attempted coup and that his death sentence was based on circumstantial evidence.[^109] The fact that even the Extraordinary Military Court acknowledged there was "no real evidence that Subandrio knew of the plot in advance or played any part in it" suggests that his conviction was politically motivated rather than based on proven guilt.[^110] Some scholars argue that Subandrio was a scapegoat for the Sukarno regime's failures and that his trial was part of the military's broader campaign to consolidate power and eliminate political opponents.[^111]

Subandrio's advocacy for non-alignment and Third World solidarity is viewed by some historians as principled and forward-thinking, positioning Indonesia as a leader among newly independent nations seeking an alternative to Cold War bloc politics.[^112] His contributions to the preparatory work for the Bandung Conference and his implementation of its principles through Indonesian foreign policy represent significant contributions to the development of the Non-Aligned Movement.[^113] The Soviet Union's support for Indonesia's non-aligned course during Subandrio's tenure demonstrates that his balancing act between East and West had some international credibility.[^114]

Some Indonesian nationalists argue that Subandrio was unfairly demonized for pursuing genuinely independent foreign policies that challenged Western hegemony.[^115] From this perspective, his close ties with China represented a legitimate exercise of Indonesian sovereignty rather than communist subversion, and his Konfrontasi policy against Malaysia was a defensible response to what he perceived as neo-colonial British influence in Southeast Asia.[^116] These defenders view the New Order's vilification of Subandrio as part of a broader campaign to discredit nationalist and left-wing alternatives to military-dominated governance.[^117]

### Negative Views

Critics of Subandrio portray him as a reckless ideologue whose policies severely damaged Indonesian interests and contributed directly to the catastrophic events of 1965-1966.[^118] His Konfrontasi policy against Malaysia is widely regarded as a costly failure that isolated Indonesia internationally, alienated potential allies, drained resources, and achieved nothing of strategic value.[^119] The policy created "great hostility between Indonesia and the Western powers, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom," undermining Indonesia's security and economic development.[^120]

Subandrio's cultivation of close ties with Communist China and his support for arming a "Fifth Force" of workers and peasants are seen by critics as evidence of either communist sympathies or dangerous political opportunism.[^121] Students who demonstrated against him in 1965-1966 accused him of "murdering the generals" and drew graffiti depicting him as a "Pekingese dog," reflecting widespread perception of his subservience to Beijing.[^122] His admission during his trial to secret meetings with Zhou Enlai regarding arms for civilian forces confirmed suspicions about his role in escalating political tensions.[^123]

Western historians and Indonesian military sources have argued that Subandrio's leadership of the Central Intelligence Board (BPI) represented a dangerous politicization of Indonesia's intelligence apparatus.[^124] The fact that the BPI under Subandrio "had absorbed many PKI (Communist Party) sympathizers" and that the army felt compelled to establish a counter-intelligence center (PSiAD) to balance it suggests that Subandrio was using state intelligence agencies for partisan political purposes.[^125] CIA memoranda from December 1965 supported claims about "the key role of Minister Subandrio's Intelligence Service in the G30S," though the reliability of such sources remains debated.[^126]

The Gilchrist Document affair is cited by critics as evidence of Subandrio's involvement in disinformation campaigns and political manipulation.[^127] The document's likely fabrication by Czechoslovakian intelligence, with Subandrio's complicity or knowledge, represented a serious breach of intelligence ethics and contributed to the conspiratorial atmosphere that preceded the 1965 violence.[^128] This affair is remembered as a "humiliation toward Indonesian intelligence" that damaged the credibility of Indonesia's foreign policy establishment.[^129]

More fundamentally, critics argue that Subandrio's concentration of power as Foreign Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and intelligence chief created an accountability vacuum that enabled poor decision-making and contributed to the political crisis.[^130] His close personal relationship with Sukarno meant that his policies went largely unchallenged, even when they clearly damaged Indonesian interests.[^131] The fact that he spent 29 years in prison, even after his death sentence was commuted, reflects the depth of anger and resentment his policies generated among Indonesia's military and political establishment.[^132]
