## Summary

Dmitri Ivanovsky was a Russian biologist who discovered viruses in 1892, demonstrating that the agent causing tobacco mosaic disease could pass through a filter too fine for bacteria. This discovery established virology as a new field of study. Although his work predated Martinus Beijerinck's independent discovery, both are credited as co-discoverers of viruses.
