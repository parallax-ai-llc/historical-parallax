## Overview

Tulip Mania (1634-1637) was the first recorded speculative bubble in history. In the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age, prices for tulip bulbs—particularly rare varieties with striking color patterns—reached extraordinary levels before suddenly collapsing in February 1637. At the peak, a single Semper Augustus bulb could cost more than a grand Amsterdam canal house. When the bubble burst, prices fell 90%+ in days. Though modern historians debate whether it was a true "mania" or a more limited speculation, Tulip Mania became the archetypal story of irrational market behavior, greed, and the dangers of speculative excess—referenced in every subsequent bubble from the South Sea to Bitcoin.

## Background

### Dutch Golden Age

**17th Century Netherlands:**
- World's richest nation
- Global trade empire (VOC)
- Financial innovation (stock exchange)
- Cultural flowering (Rembrandt, Vermeer)
- Wealth seeking investment outlets

### Tulips in Europe

**From Ottoman Empire:**
Tulips introduced to Europe via Ottoman Turkey (1550s). Name from Turkish "tülbend" (turban).

**Cultivation:**
Netherlands' soil ideal for tulips. Dutch developed new varieties.

**Status Symbol:**
Rare tulips became luxury goods, status symbols for wealthy merchants.

## The Bubble

### What Made Tulips Valuable?

**"Broken" Tulips:**
Virus (mosaic virus) caused color "breaks"—flames, feathers, stripes on petals. These patterns couldn't be reproduced predictably, making them rare.

**Famous Varieties:**
- **Semper Augustus:** White with red flames—most valuable
- **Viceroy**
- **Admiral van der Eijck**

### Speculation Begins (1634-1636)

**Rising Prices:**
Demand exceeded supply. Prices climbed steadily.

**Futures Contracts:**
Trading in "windhandel" (wind trade)—buying/selling tulip futures before bulbs even existed.

**New Participants:**
Artisans, tradespeople, even servants began speculating. Not just wealthy.

### Peak (December 1636 - January 1637)

**Extraordinary Prices:**
Single bulbs sold for:
- 10,000 guilders (skilled worker's 10-year salary)
- More than a grand house on Amsterdam canal
- Dozens of livestock

**Semper Augustus:**
One bulb reportedly offered for 12 acres of land.

## The Crash

### February 1637

**Haarlem Auction:**
February 5, 1637. Buyers suddenly didn't appear at an auction. No bids.

**Panic:**
Word spread. Everyone tried to sell; no buyers. Prices collapsed.

**90%+ Decline:**
Bulbs that traded for thousands became nearly worthless.

### Aftermath

**Legal Chaos:**
Contracts couldn't be enforced. Courts eventually ruled futures contracts were gambling debts—unenforceable.

**Economic Impact (Debated):**
- Some historians: widespread bankruptcy
- Recent research: More limited to narrow trading group; minimal broader economic damage

## Historical Debate

### Was It Really a "Mania"?

**Traditional View (Charles Mackay, 1841):**
*Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds* portrayed tulip mania as irrational mass hysteria.

**Modern Scholarship:**
- Anne Goldgar (*Tulipmania*, 2007): More nuanced. Trading limited to wealthy; fewer bankruptcies than legends suggest.
- Peter Garber: Rational pricing for rare items (like art).

### Regardless

Became world's most famous example of speculative bubble. Invoked in every market crash.

## Why Tulips?

### Unique Characteristics

- **Rarity:** Broken tulips couldn't be readily reproduced
