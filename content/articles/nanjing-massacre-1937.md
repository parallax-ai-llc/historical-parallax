## Summary

The **Nanjing Massacre** (also known as the Rape of Nanking) was a six-week period of mass murder and mass rape committed by the Imperial Japanese Army after capturing Nanjing, the capital of the Republic of China, on December 13, 1937. Soldiers murdered unarmed combatants and civilians, numbering between **200,000 and 300,000**. The atrocities were unprecedented in their savagery, including beheadings, live burials, and the widespread sexual assault of tens of thousands of women.

## The "Rape" of Nanking

### Mass Sexual Violence
The event is infamously termed "Rape" because of the sheer scale of sexual violence.
*   **Scale:** Estimates of rapes range from 20,000 to 80,000.
*   **Victims:** Victims ranged from infants and young girls to elderly women over 80. Nuns and pregnant women were not spared.
*   **Brutality:** Gang rapes were common. Soldiers often mutilated victims post-assault with bayonets, bamboo sticks, or other objects to eliminate witnesses. Many women were killed immediately after the assault.

## Methods of Slaughter

### The Killing Contests
Japanese newspapers (*Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun*) famously reported on a "contest" between two officers, **Toshiaki Mukai** and **Tsuyoshi Noda**, to see who could be the first to kill 100 people with a sword.
*   **The Score:** The papers reported the score daily like a sporting event. When the score reached 106–105, they decided to extend the goal to 150 because they couldn't determine who reached 100 first.
*   **Aftermath:** Both men were extradited to China after the war, tried, and executed by firing squad.

### Mass Executions
*   **The Yangtze River:** Thousands of prisoners of war and civilians were bound and marched to the banks of the Yangtze River, where they were machine-gunned. Their bodies were dumped into the river to wash away the evidence.
*   **Live Burial and Mutilation:** Civilians were used for bayonet practice. Others were buried alive, burned to death, or decapitated.

## International Witnesses: The Safety Zone

A small group of Westerners, led by German businessman **John Rabe** (a Nazi Party member), established the **Nanjing Safety Zone** to protect civilians.
*   **The Zone:** A 2-square-mile area that housed some 200,000 refugees.
*   **Diaries:** Rabe and American missionary **Minnie Vautrin** kept detailed diaries of the atrocities. Rabe famously wrote to Hitler asking him to intervene with the Japanese allies, but was ignored. Vautrin, haunted by the women she couldn't save from being dragged out of the zone by soldiers, later committed suicide.

## Aftermath and Denial

### The Tribunals
*   **General Iwane Matsui**, commander of the Japanese forces, was found guilty of failing to control his troops and was hanged.
*   **Prince Asaka**, the Emperor's uncle who was in command during the massacre and likely issued the "kill all captives" order, was granted immunity by the U.S. because he was a member of the Imperial family.

### Historical Revisionism
The massacre remains a major flashpoint in Sino-Japanese relations. While the Japanese government has issued apologies, prominent conservative politicians and textbooks in Japan frequently downplay the death toll or deny the massacre happened (claiming it was a "fabrication"), causing deep diplomatic fury in China.
