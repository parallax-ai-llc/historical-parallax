## Overview

The Cambridge Five were a ring of spies in the United Kingdom who passed information to the Soviet Union during World War II and the early Cold War. Recruited at the University of Cambridge in the 1930s, these five men—Kim Philby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt, and John Cairncross—infiltrated the highest levels of British intelligence (MI5, MI6) and the Foreign Office. They were upper-class, educated "gentlemen," which made them invisible to a British establishment that couldn't believe "one of us" could be a traitor. Their betrayal compromised thousands of agents, leaked atomic secrets, and destroyed American trust in British security for decades.

### 3. Guy Burgess ("Hicks")

## Recruitment

### Cambridge 1930s

**Atmosphere:**
Rise of Fascism (Hitler, Franco). Capitalism seemed to be failing (Great Depression). Communism seen by idealistic students as the only answer to Fascism.

**Arnold Deutsch:**
Soviet recruiter. Targeted bright students. Told them to abandon open communist parties and "go underground" to infiltrate government.

## The Exposure

### The Clue (1949-1951)

**Venona:**
US/UK decrypts identified a spy codenamed "Homer" in the British Embassy in Washington in 1944. Investigations narrowed it to **Donald Maclean**.

### The Tip-Off (1951)

**Philby's Move:**
Kim Philby (in Washington) realized Maclean was about to be caught. He knew if Maclean cracked, he would expose everyone.
He sent **Guy Burgess** (who was living with him) back to London to warn Maclean.

### The Flight (May 25, 1951)

**Maclean's Birthday:**
Maclean and Burgess took a ferry to France, then train to Moscow. Disappeared.
Shocked the world.

### The Third Man

**Philby Under Suspicion:**
Philby was close friend of Burgess. MI5 interrogated him. Forced to resign 1951.
**Publicly cleared:**
1955: British Foreign Secretary cleared him in Parliament ("No evidence").
Philby gave famous press conference lying calmly.

**Defection (1963):**
New evidence surfaced. Philby fled from Beirut to Moscow.

## Impact

### "Establishment Cover-Up"

The fact that these men were allowed to escape, or given immunity (Blunt), fueled belief that the British class system protected its own.

### CIA Distrust

James Angleton (CIA counter-intelligence) became paranoid. Believed a "mole" was inside CIA. Paralyzed Western intelligence for years hunting ghosts.

---

## Life in Russia

**Disappointment:**
They missed cricket, London clubs, Harrods.
Soviets distrusted them (thought they might be triple agents).
Burgess drank himself to death. Philby became a minor celebrity but lonely.
