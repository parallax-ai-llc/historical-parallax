## Summary

Chinul (also known as Bojo Jinul) was the most important figure in Korean Seon (Zen) Buddhism. He reformed Korean Buddhism by synthesizing Seon meditation with Huayan (Hwaeom) doctrinal study. He founded the Jogye Order, which remains the largest Buddhist order in Korea today. His approach of 'sudden enlightenment followed by gradual cultivation' became the defining practice of Korean Buddhism.
