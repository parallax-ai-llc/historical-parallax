## Summary

Anders Celsius created the Celsius temperature scale in 1742, originally defined with 0 as the boiling point and 100 as the freezing point (later reversed). He made significant contributions to understanding the aurora borealis and was the first to show that they had magnetic causes. He also measured the shape of the Earth during a Lapland expedition.
