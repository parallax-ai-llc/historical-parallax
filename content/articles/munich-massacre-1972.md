## Overview

The Munich Massacre was a terrorist attack during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany. Eight members of the Palestinian terrorist group Black September infiltrated the Olympic Village, killed two members of the Israeli Olympic team, and took nine others hostage. After a tense standoff and a botched rescue attempt by German police at an airport, all nine hostages were killed, along with a German police officer and five of the terrorists. The massacre shocked the world—millions watched the drama unfold live on TV—and forever ended the innocence of the Olympic Games. It led to Israel's covert retaliation campaign ("Operation Wrath of God") and the creation of modern counter-terrorism units like GSG 9.

## Background

### The "Happy Games"

**West Germany's Goal:**
1972 was first German Olympics since Nazi Games of 1936.
Goal: Show a new, friendly, democratic Germany.
**Security:** Intentionally light. Police unarmed. No barriers.

### Black September

**The Group:**
Factions of PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization). Founded after "Black September" conflict in Jordan (1970).

**The Plan:**
Seize hostages to trade for 234 Palestinian prisoners in Israel and RAF terrorists in Germany.

## The Attack (September 5, 1972)

### 4:30 AM: Infiltration

Terrorists climbed fence (helped by unsuspecting American athletes). Used stolen keys to enter Connollystraße 31 (Israeli apartments).

### Initial Assault

**Moshe Weinberg (Wrestling coach):**
Fought back. Shot in cheek. Forced to lead terrorists to other rooms. Led them past Room 2 (fencers/shooters) to Room 3 (weightlifters/wrestlers), hoping stronger men could fight.

**Yossef Romano (Weightlifter):**
Attacked terrorists with fruit knife. Shot and killed. Castrated (post-mortem).

**Hostages:**
9 Israelis taken hostage. Weinberg executed. (Total 2 dead, 9 captive).

---

## The Standoff

### Negotiations

**Demands:** Release of 234 prisoners by 9:00 AM.

**Israel's Response:**
Prime Minister Golda Meir refused to negotiate with terrorists. "If we give in, no Israeli anywhere will be safe."

**Germany's Response:**
Desperate. Offered unlimited money. Offered themselves as substitute hostages. Terrorists refused.

**Extensions:**
Deadlines extended throughout day. Live TV coverage (terrorists watched TV to see police positions).

### Plan to Move

Terrorists demanded plane to Cairo. Germans agreed (trap). Helicopters flew them to Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base.

## The Rescue Attempt (Disaster)

### Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base

**German Police Failure:**
- No specialized anti-terror unit existed.
- Snipers were regular police, no radios, no night vision, no helmets.
- Intel failure: Thought there were 5 terrorists; actually 8.

**10:30 PM: Firefight:**
Snipers opened fire. Chaos.
- Terrorists realized trap.
- Returned fire.
- Standoff ensued for over an hour.

**Midnight Massacre:**
- Terrorist threw grenade into one helicopter (killing 4 hostages).
