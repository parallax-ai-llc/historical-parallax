## Summary

George Berkeley (1685-1753) was an Anglo-Irish philosopher, Anglican bishop, and polymath best known as the founder of immaterialism—later called subjective idealism—encapsulated in his famous principle *esse est percipi* ("to be is to be perceived"). Born in County Kilkenny, Ireland, Berkeley served as Bishop of Cloyne from 1734 until his retirement in 1752. His philosophical works, particularly *A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge* (1710) and *Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous* (1713), profoundly influenced empiricism and idealism, shaping the thought of later philosophers including David Hume and Immanuel Kant.[^1][^2] Beyond philosophy, Berkeley made significant contributions to mathematics, economics, vision theory, and theology, though his legacy has become controversial due to his ownership of enslaved people and defense of slavery.[^3][^4]

## Early Life and Background

George Berkeley was born on March 12, 1685, near Dysert Castle, near Thomastown, County Kilkenny, Ireland, the eldest son of William Berkeley, a gentleman farmer and commissioned officer described as a cornet of dragoons whose family originally came from Staffordshire, England.[^5][^6] His mother, Elisabeth Southerne, was the daughter of a Dublin brewer, though little else is known about her.[^7] The Berkeley family was moderately prosperous and Protestant, as were most Irish of English descent during this period.[^8]

Berkeley grew up at Dysert Castle, which his father owned, in the Irish countryside that would later influence his philosophical thinking about perception and the nature of reality.[^9] He received his early education at the Duke of Ormonde's School in Kilkenny, which he entered in July 1696 and attended until January 1700.[^10] This school, also known as Kilkenny College, was one of Ireland's premier educational institutions and provided Berkeley with a rigorous classical education in Latin, Greek, and the humanities.[^11]

In 1700, at age fifteen, Berkeley entered Trinity College, Dublin, where he would spend the formative years of his intellectual development.[^12] He was elected a Scholar in 1702, a prestigious recognition of his academic abilities.[^13] Berkeley received his Bachelor of Arts degree on February 24, 1704, and became a fellow of Trinity College in June 1707, the same year he received his Master of Arts degree.[^14][^15] During these years at Trinity, Berkeley formed a society with fellow students to discuss the "new philosophy" emerging from thinkers like John Locke, Isaac Newton, and Nicolas Malebranche.[^16] It was during this period, around 1707-1708, that Berkeley began composing his philosophical notebooks, later known as the *Philosophical Commentaries*, in which he developed the revolutionary ideas that would define his career.[^17]

Berkeley was ordained as a deacon in the Anglican Church in 1709, shortly after publishing his first major work, and was ordained as a priest in 1710.[^18][^19] He remained at Trinity College after completing his degrees, serving as a tutor and Greek lecturer, and later, after taking Holy Orders in 1721 and earning his doctorate in divinity, he lectured in Divinity and Hebrew.[^20][^21] This combination of philosophical inquiry and religious vocation would characterize Berkeley's entire intellectual life, as his philosophical motivations were fundamentally rooted in his Christian faith and his desire to combat skepticism and atheism.[^22]

## Rise to Prominence

Berkeley's rise to philosophical prominence began remarkably early, with the publication of three major works in his mid-twenties that would establish his reputation across Europe. In 1709, at age twenty-four, he published *An Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision*, which discussed the limitations of human vision and advanced the revolutionary theory that the proper objects of sight are not material objects themselves, but light and color.[^23][^24] This work was an influential contribution to the psychology of vision and developed doctrines relevant to his broader idealist project.[^25]

The following year, in 1710, Berkeley published his most important philosophical work, *A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge*, in which he systematically developed his doctrine of immaterialism.[^26] In this treatise, Berkeley argued that material substance does not exist and that reality consists only of minds (spirits) and their ideas (perceptions).[^27] The work was met with confusion and criticism from contemporaries who found his arguments paradoxical and difficult to accept, despite being unable to refute them.[^28]

In response to the criticisms and misunderstandings of the *Principles*, Berkeley published *Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous* in 1713, presenting his philosophy in a more accessible dialogue form.[^29] In this work, Philonous (meaning "lover of mind") represents Berkeley's views, while Hylas (from the Greek "hyle," meaning "matter") represents materialist positions, particularly those of John Locke.[^30] The *Three Dialogues* systematically dismantled materialist arguments while demonstrating that Berkeley's immaterialism was neither skeptical nor atheistic, but rather supported common sense and religious faith.[^31]

These publications established Berkeley as one of the most cited philosophers of eighteenth-century Europe, and his works deeply influenced later thinkers such as Immanuel Kant and David Hume.[^32] Berkeley was recognized as a brilliant critic of his predecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke, and played a leading role in the empiricist movement as one of its pioneers.[^33][^34] A linear development is often traced from the three great "British Empiricists," leading from Locke through Berkeley to Hume, cementing Berkeley's position in the philosophical canon.[^35]

Beyond his philosophical writings, Berkeley's intellectual ambitions extended to practical matters. In the 1720s, he conceived an ambitious plan to found a college in Bermuda to educate Native Americans and British colonists in the liberal arts, sciences, and Christian ministry.[^36] In 1725, he published a "Proposal" for this project and received a warrant from King George I and a promise of £20,000 from Parliament.[^37] King George I issued a formal charter for Saint Paul's College, Bermuda, in 1725.[^38] This project, though ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrated Berkeley's commitment to education and missionary work, and led to his extended residence in the American colonies, which would profoundly influence his later thought.[^39]

## Major Achievements

### Philosophy: Immaterialism and Idealism

Berkeley's greatest achievement was the development of immaterialism, later known as subjective idealism, which German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer called the foundation of all idealism, naming Berkeley "the father of idealism."[^40][^41] In the *Principles* and *Three Dialogues*, Berkeley defended two revolutionary metaphysical theses: idealism (the claim that everything that exists either is a mind or depends on a mind for its existence) and immaterialism (the claim that matter does not exist).[^42]

Berkeley's philosophy is encapsulated in his famous Latin motto *esse est percipi* ("to be is to be perceived"), which he stated in *Principles* §3 as "esse is percipi," combining Latin and English.[^43][^44] This principle asserts that physical objects have no existence independent of being perceived by a mind.[^45] However, Berkeley did not deny the existence of physical objects like apples or mountains; rather, he argued that these objects are nothing more than collections of ideas in minds.[^46] As he wrote: "I do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend, either by sense or reflection. That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance."[^47]

Berkeley's system addressed the traditional philosophical problem of how we can know anything about an external material world by denying the existence of such a world altogether. He argued that materialism promotes both skepticism (because it implies our senses may mislead us about material things that might not exist at all) and atheism (because a material world could be expected to run without God's assistance).[^48] By contrast, Berkeley's immaterialism made knowledge immediate and certain while establishing God as the necessary sustainer of reality, since God's perpetual perception maintains the existence of all things even when no human perceives them.[^49][^50]

### Theory of Vision

Berkeley's *Essay Towards a New Theory of Vision* (1709) made groundbreaking contributions to the psychology of vision and perception. He argued that distance, magnitude, and position are not immediately perceived by sight but are instead learned through experience and association with tactile sensations.[^51] This work influenced modern psychology, particularly through Berkeley's use of John Locke's theory of association to explain how humans gain knowledge in the physical world and to demonstrate that all qualities were "secondary qualities," meaning perception lay entirely in the perceiver rather than in the object.[^52]

### Mathematics: Critique of Calculus

In 1734, Berkeley published *The Analyst: A Discourse Addressed to an Infidel Mathematician*, a devastating critique of the logical foundations of calculus as developed by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.[^53][^54] The "infidel mathematician" was believed to be Edmond Halley, though some have speculated that Newton himself was intended.[^55] Berkeley famously described Newton's fluxions (derivatives) as "ghosts of departed quantities," arguing: "And what are these fluxions? The velocities of evanescent increments... They are neither finite quantities, nor quantities infinitely small, nor yet nothing. May we not call them ghosts of departed quantities?"[^56]

Mathematics historian Judith Grabiner commented that "Berkeley's criticisms of the rigor of the calculus were witty, unkind, and — with respect to the mathematical practices he was criticizing — essentially correct."[^57] Berkeley's main point was not to mock mathematics but to show that mathematicians, like the Christians they criticized, relied upon unknowable mysteries in the foundations of their reasoning.[^58] His critique was well-founded and important in that it focused the attention of mathematicians on the logical clarification of calculus, ultimately stimulating British mathematicians to inquire into its logical foundations and place it upon a more secure basis.[^59][^60]

Berkeley also argued against Isaac Newton's doctrine of absolute space, time, and motion in *De Motu* (On Motion), first published in 1721, with arguments that were notable precursors to those of Ernst Mach and Albert Einstein.[^61]

### Economics: *The Querist* and Monetary Theory

Following his return from Rhode Island in 1732 and assumption of his post as Bishop of Cloyne, Berkeley became acutely engaged with Irish economic issues, viewing the primary problems facing Ireland as economic and moral in nature.[^62] Between 1735 and 1737, he published *The Querist*, a work consisting entirely of questions about economic and social issues germane to Ireland.[^63][^64] The work contained revolutionary proposals for monetary reform and broke the conceptual link between money and metallic substance, defending fiat currency in a way that proved prescient when viewed from the monetary reality of the twenty-first century.[^65][^66]

The three main principles of Berkeley's *Querist* were protectionism, national banking, and social paternalism.[^67] The central economic proposal was that of a National Bank with necessary regulations on stock-jobbing, profiteering, and non-productive finance, which could help provide monetary sovereignty for the Irish economy.[^68] Berkeley's defense of fiat currency in *The Querist* rested on the same philosophical foundation as his defense of immaterialism in the *Principles* and *Dialogues*.[^69]

### Religious Works and Episcopal Service

Berkeley's religious writings were substantial and influential. In 1732, he published *Alciphron*, a work of Christian apologetics directed against the "free-thinkers" whom he took to be enemies of established Anglicanism.[^70][^71] The work was composed during his time in America and demonstrated his commitment to defending Christian faith through philosophical argument.[^72]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Philosophical Objections to Immaterialism

Berkeley's immaterialism was met with significant resistance from his contemporaries and continues to be controversial among philosophers. As a matter of historical fact, Berkeley persuaded few of his contemporaries, who for the most part regarded him as a purveyor of skeptical paradoxes.[^73] The Scottish philosopher David Hume famously quipped that Berkeley's arguments "admit of no answer and produce no conviction. Their only effect is to cause that momentary amazement and irresolution and confusion, which is the result of scepticism."[^74] Many readers found themselves unable to refute Berkeley's arguments yet remained unconvinced by them.[^75]

Critics have attacked various aspects of Berkeley's philosophy. One significant criticism concerns Berkeley's definition of matter as something which can exist independently of the mind; commentators have noted that this is merely a definition he employed to make his argument cohesive and literally impossible to refute.[^76] The Master Argument, which purports to show that the very idea of an object existing outside of the mind is inconceivable, has been challenged on the grounds that the impossibility of conceiving something unconceived does not prove the impossibility of unconceived existence.[^77]

Although Berkeley's subjective idealism has been enormously influential, it is widely dismissed by contemporary philosophers. John Searle noted: "Idealism had a prodigious influence in philosophy, literally for centuries, but as far as I can tell it has been dead as a doornail among nearly all of the philosophers."[^78] One scholar contends that "idealism went out of style rather than was defeated," suggesting that Berkeley's arguments were never successfully refuted but simply abandoned.[^79] Nevertheless, Berkeley's denial of matter is "dismissed unanimously when it is understood, a rare distinction among post-Renaissance philosophers."[^80]

### Mathematical Controversies

Berkeley's critique of calculus, while ultimately beneficial to mathematics, was initially controversial and seen by some as an attack on the scientific establishment. His motivation was partly apologetic—to demonstrate that mathematicians relied on mysteries and uncertainties just as theologians did—which annoyed some mathematicians who saw it as bad-faith criticism.[^81] However, two years after *The Analyst*, Thomas Bayes published anonymously "An Introduction to the Doctrine of Fluxions, and a Defence of the Mathematicians Against the Objections of the Author of the Analyst" (1736), defending Newton's calculus against Berkeley's objections.[^82]

### The Tar-Water Controversy

In 1744, Berkeley published *Siris*, a work promoting tar-water (a mixture of water and pine tar) as a near-universal medicine or "panacea."[^83][^84] Berkeley had heard of tar-water during his time in the American colonies and used it for his own health problems.[^85] While distributing £20 a week among the poor of Cloyne, he advocated this substance as a potential cure for infections, particularly following the Great Frost of 1739/40 which brought rampant disease to a region with nearly non-existent medical infrastructure.[^86]

Berkeley declared tar-water to be "a Medicine that cures or relieves all the different Species of Distempers," describing how "the particles of tar are not only warm and active, they are also balsamic and emollient, softening and enriching the sharp and vapid blood, and healing the erosions occasioned thereby in the blood-vessels and glands."[^87][^88] *Siris* became extremely popular, passing through some six editions in six months.[^89]

However, the medical establishment was highly critical. Dr. Thomas Reeve, later President of the Royal College of Physicians, argued that *Siris* was riddled with scientific errors.[^90] Critics, including physicians such as James Jurin, dismissed tar-water's purported benefits as lacking rigorous evidence.[^91] Despite the medical criticism, *Siris* extended beyond health claims to embody a philosophical bridge between empiricism and metaphysics, portraying tar-water as an accessible entry point to "natural philosophy" and chaining reflections from the practical virtues of tar-water to broader inquiries into Platonic ideas, divine order, and the Great Chain of Being.[^92]

### Slavery and Slave Ownership

The most serious contemporary criticism of Berkeley concerns his ownership of enslaved people and his defense of slavery. When Berkeley arrived in Newport, Rhode Island in 1729, he bought a plantation in nearby Middletown called Whitehall, where he purchased at least three Black slaves to work the farm.[^93] On October 4, 1730, Berkeley purchased "a negro man named Philip aged 14 years or thereabout," and a few days later purchased "a negro man named Edward aged 20 years or thereabouts."[^94] The following year, he baptized three enslaved people: Philip, Anthony, and Agnes Berkeley.[^95]

Berkeley wrote a pamphlet arguing that slaves should be baptized as it would make them more obedient, justifying slavery as a path to Christian conversion.[^96] While his views were relatively orthodox for his time, there were contemporaries who strongly condemned the slave trade, making Berkeley's position morally culpable even by eighteenth-century standards.[^97] Enslaved people continued to work at Whitehall, and profits made from slave labor were used to fund scholarships for Yale students after Berkeley donated his estate to Yale College.[^98]

In 2023, Trinity College Dublin voted to expunge Berkeley's name from its central library, stating: "While Berkeley's enormous contribution to philosophical thought is not in question, it is also clear that he was both an owner of enslaved people and a theorist of slavery and racial discrimination, which is in clear conflict with Trinity's core values."[^99] Similarly, UC Berkeley and the city of Berkeley, California, both named after the philosopher, have faced calls for renaming, though no formal plans are currently underway.[^100][^101] UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof stated: "We acknowledge that the university's founders chose to name their new town and campus after an individual whose views warrant no honor or commemoration," while maintaining that the name "Berkeley" has come to represent a set of values rather than the man himself.[^102]

## Personal Life

On August 1, 1728, at St Mary le Strand, London, Berkeley married Anne Forster, daughter of John Forster, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas, and Forster's first wife Rebecca Monck.[^103][^104] Anne Forster Berkeley was born at the dawn of the eighteenth century and was educated in France, where she became fluent in the French language.[^105] Berkeley expressed great satisfaction with his marriage, writing to his friend Thomas Prior that Anne's "humour and turn of mind pleases me beyond anything that I know in her whole sex," and to Lord Percival, he noted: "I chose her for the qualities of her mind and her unaffected inclination to books."[^106]

Berkeley and Anne had four children who survived infancy: Henry, George, William, and Julia, as well as at least two others who did not survive.[^107] One of the children who died young was Lucia Berkeley, who was buried in Newport, Rhode Island in September 1731.[^108] William's death in 1751 was a great cause of grief for his father.[^109] Berkeley's affectionate disposition and genial manners made him much loved and held in warm regard by many of his contemporaries.[^110]

In September 1728, shortly after his marriage, Berkeley sailed for America with his wife and landed in Newport, Rhode Island, assembling some of his college faculty to await funding for his Bermuda college project.[^111][^112] Berkeley bought a farm in Middletown and had architect Dalton enlarge the little farmhouse with an elegant design into North America's first Palladian-style house, which he named Whitehall.[^113] After nearly three years in Newport, Berkeley realized the promised grant would never materialize, as officials said General James Oglethorpe wanted to found the new colony of Georgia and there would not be enough money for both projects.[^114][^115]

After Berkeley's return to England, he gave his entire Whitehall estate—his house, farm, and his library—to Yale College, with the annual profits to be applied to the maintenance of three resident scholars.[^116] This generous donation established a lasting connection between Berkeley and American higher education.[^117]

Berkeley was nominated to be Bishop of Cloyne in the Church of Ireland on January 18, 1734, and was consecrated on May 19, 1734.[^118][^119] He served as bishop of an economically poor Anglican diocese in a predominantly Roman Catholic country, and he was committed to the well-being of both Protestants and Catholics.[^120] Berkeley carried out his episcopal duties with vigor and humanity, administering his diocese with skill and grace for eighteen years.[^121][^122]

In 1752, Berkeley retired from his position as Bishop of Cloyne and went to Oxford with his wife and daughter Julia to live with his son George and supervise his education.[^123] He died peacefully on the evening of Sunday, January 14, 1753, of a heart attack while sitting with his family listening to his wife read.[^124] He died so peacefully that the event went unnoticed, the family thinking he had fallen asleep.[^125] He was buried in Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford.[^126] Anne outlived her husband by many years, dying in 1786.[^127]

## Legacy

### Philosophical Influence

George Berkeley's legacy in philosophy is profound and enduring. He is unarguably Ireland's greatest philosopher, and his work is part of every standard undergraduate philosophy curriculum.[^128] His influence extended directly to David Hume, Immanuel Kant, and the positivists, fundamentally shaping the development of modern philosophy.[^129] Berkeley's "thought made possible the work of Hume and thus Kant," as Alfred North Whitehead noted, establishing Berkeley's central position in the trajectory of Western philosophy.[^130]

Berkeley's most-studied works, the *Principles* and the *Three Dialogues*, are "beautifully written and dense with the sort of arguments that delight contemporary philosophers."[^131] His philosophical system, "while it strikes many as counter-intuitive, is strong and flexible enough to counter most objections."[^132] Interest in Berkeley's ideas and works increased greatly after World War II because they tackled many issues of paramount interest to twentieth-century philosophy, such as problems of perception, the difference between primary and secondary qualities, and the importance of language.[^133]

The scholarly community has maintained active engagement with Berkeley's work, with over 1,000 works published between 1932 and 1979, and publications reaching 30 per annum since then.[^134] Recent scholarship has moved beyond "the traditional strategy of treating his philosophy simply as a stepping stone from Locke to Hume" and now asks readers "to reconsider Berkeley on his own terms."[^135] Modern scholarship "brings out the fresh interest of Berkeley's work for contemporary philosophy."[^136]

### Broader Intellectual Impact

Beyond philosophy proper, Berkeley's contributions to other fields have had lasting influence. His critique of calculus, while controversial, stimulated important developments in mathematical rigor and the logical foundations of analysis.[^137] His work on vision influenced modern psychology, particularly through his theories of perception and the role of association in learning.[^138] His economic writings anticipated modern theories of fiat currency and monetary policy in ways that were remarkably prescient.[^139]

### Memorialization and Controversy

Berkeley's name has been honored in various ways, most notably in the naming of the city of Berkeley, California, and the University of California, Berkeley. Frederick Billings, a trustee of the College of California, suggested in 1866 that the new campus site north of Oakland be named in honor of Berkeley, choosing him "for the singular honor of giving the school his name" as "a scholar, churchman, proponent of both social causes and higher education and a philosopher still read today."[^140][^141] In 1873, Billings commissioned a portrait of Berkeley by John Weir as a gift to the university.[^142]

However, Berkeley's legacy has become increasingly controversial due to his slave ownership and defense of slavery. The portrait that Billings commissioned was removed from public display at UC Berkeley and placed in storage because "of views held by George Berkeley that contradict the values of the university and the Library."[^143] The city of Berkeley has no plaque, statue, or publicly displayed painting of its namesake.[^144]

In 2023, Trinity College Dublin voted to remove Berkeley's name from its library, stating that while his philosophical contributions are unquestionable, his involvement with slavery "is in clear conflict with Trinity's core values."[^145] This decision sparked discussions about whether UC Berkeley or the city of Berkeley should consider renaming, though no formal efforts have materialized.[^146] UC Berkeley maintains that the name "Berkeley" has come to represent a set of values rather than the historical figure himself.[^147]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars recognize Berkeley as one of the great modern philosophers and a pivotal figure in the development of empiricism and idealism. His philosophical works are praised for their clarity, argumentative rigor, and originality. Berkeley was "among the most cited philosophers of 18th-century Europe," and his influence on subsequent philosophy is undeniable.[^148] Arthur Schopenhauer's designation of Berkeley as "the father of idealism" acknowledges his foundational role in one of philosophy's major traditions.[^149]

Contemporary philosophers appreciate Berkeley's skill as a critic and dialectician. He was "a brilliant critic of his predecessors, particularly Descartes, Malebranche, and Locke."[^150] His arguments, while often rejected in their conclusions, are recognized as sophisticated and difficult to refute. Philosophers continue to engage seriously with his works, finding them rich sources for contemporary debates in metaphysics, epistemology, and philosophy of mind.[^151]

Berkeley's contributions to fields beyond philosophy receive positive recognition. Judith Grabiner's assessment that Berkeley's criticisms of calculus were "essentially correct" demonstrates that his mathematical work had genuine merit.[^152] His economic writings are seen as innovative and prescient, anticipating modern monetary theory in remarkable ways.[^153] As a bishop, Berkeley is remembered for his humane administration of his diocese and his concern for both Protestants and Catholics in a divided society.[^154]

Scholars also appreciate Berkeley's integration of philosophy and religion, seeing his work as a serious attempt to defend faith through reason and to combat the atheism and skepticism he perceived in materialist philosophy.[^155] His Christian apologetics, particularly in *Alciphron*, demonstrate a sophisticated engagement with Enlightenment debates about religion and reason.[^156]

### Negative Views

Despite his philosophical significance, Berkeley faces substantial criticism from multiple perspectives. The most severe contemporary criticism concerns his slave ownership and defense of slavery. Modern scholars and institutions increasingly view Berkeley's involvement with slavery as disqualifying him from honor, with Trinity College Dublin explicitly stating that his "theorist of slavery and racial discrimination" status conflicts with core values.[^157] Critics argue that Berkeley actively participated in and intellectually defended a morally abhorrent institution, making him complicit in profound injustice.[^158]

Philosophically, Berkeley's immaterialism is widely rejected by contemporary philosophers. John Searle's blunt assessment that idealism is "dead as a doornail among nearly all of the philosophers" reflects the mainstream view.[^159] Critics argue that Berkeley's denial of matter is fundamentally implausible and contrary to common sense, despite the difficulty of refuting his arguments.[^160] Some see his philosophy as a clever sophistry that produces "no conviction" despite admitting "no answer," as Hume observed.[^161]

Berkeley's tar-water advocacy has been criticized as pseudoscientific quackery that damaged his reputation and credibility. Medical historians note that the medical establishment of his time correctly identified *Siris* as riddled with errors and lacking rigorous evidence.[^162] This episode is sometimes seen as demonstrating poor judgment and credulity, though others defend it as a well-intentioned response to a public health crisis using the limited medical knowledge available.[^163]

Some critics argue that Berkeley's philosophy is fundamentally incoherent or relies on unjustified assumptions. His definition of matter as that which exists independently of mind has been criticized as circular, designed to make his position unassailable rather than to address the actual issue.[^164] His reliance on God's perpetual perception to maintain the existence of unperceived objects is seen by some as an ad hoc theological addition rather than a genuine solution to philosophical problems.[^165]

Finally, Berkeley's American college project is sometimes viewed as a failed imperialist venture rooted in problematic assumptions about Native Americans and colonialism, though others see it as a genuine if misguided attempt at education and conversion.[^166]
