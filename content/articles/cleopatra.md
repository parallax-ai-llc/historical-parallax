## Summary

Cleopatra VII Philopator (69-30 BCE) was the last active pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt, renowned for her intelligence, political acumen, and romantic liaisons with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony. Ascending to the throne at 18, she navigated Egypt's precarious position between Rome's civil war factions through strategic alliances. Fluent in nine languages and well-educated, Cleopatra styled herself as the goddess Isis reborn and employed both diplomacy and charm to protect Egypt's independence. Her alliances with Caesar and Antony aimed to preserve Egypt but ultimately led to war with Rome. After Antony's defeat by Octavian (future Emperor Augustus) at the Battle of Actium (31 BCE), Cleopatra committed suicide, ending both her life and Egypt's independence. She remains one of history's most famous women, though often misrepresented.
