## Summary

Na Seok-ju (羅錫疇, February 4, 1892 – December 28, 1926) was a Korean independence activist who fought against Japanese colonial rule during one of the darkest periods in Korean history. Born into a farming family in Hwanghae Province, Na became radicalized after his family lost their land to Japanese colonial authorities. He is best remembered for his daring attack on December 28, 1926, when he threw grenades and opened fire at the Oriental Development Company and Joseon Industrial Bank in Seoul—two symbols of Japanese economic exploitation. After a fierce gun battle with Japanese police, Na shot himself three times in the chest rather than be captured alive, dying later that day at age 34.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Na Seok-ju was born on February 4, 1892, in Chaeryong County, Hwanghae Province, in the waning years of the Joseon Dynasty.[^3] He was the son of Na Byeong-heon (羅秉憲) and grew up in a farming family in the rural village of Namji-ri in Bukryul-myeon.[^4] His childhood coincided with a tumultuous period in Korean history, as Japan steadily increased its influence over the Korean peninsula following the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).

The annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910, known as the Gyeongsul National Shame (경술국치), fundamentally transformed Na's life and set him on the path to revolutionary activism.[^5] Following the annexation, the Japanese colonial government established the Oriental Development Company (東洋拓殖株式會社), a semi-governmental corporation designed to facilitate Japanese settlement and economic exploitation of Korea.[^6] Through systematic land confiscation programs disguised as cadastral surveys, the company came to control over one-third of Korea's arable land by the late 1920s.[^7]

Na's family was among the countless Korean households dispossessed of their ancestral lands during this period. The loss reduced his family from independent farmers to tenant farmers, forced to pay more than 50% of their harvest to Japanese landlords.[^8] This personal experience of economic devastation at the hands of colonial authorities would profoundly shape Na's worldview and fuel his later revolutionary activities. The young Na witnessed firsthand how the Oriental Development Company systematically stripped Korean families of their livelihoods, pushing approximately 300,000 Koreans into exile in Manchuria by 1926.[^9]

As he came of age, Na recognized that armed resistance would be necessary to free Korea from Japanese domination. He made the difficult decision to leave his hometown and traveled to Manchuria, where various Korean independence groups had established bases and training camps beyond the reach of Japanese colonial police.[^10] For four years, Na underwent rigorous military training in Manchuria, learning guerrilla warfare tactics, weapons handling, and revolutionary theory.[^11] This period of preparation in exile was common among Korean independence activists, as Manchuria and the Russian Far East served as crucial staging grounds for armed resistance against Japan throughout the colonial period.

After completing his military training, Na returned to his hometown in Hwanghae Province and took a position as manager of a local store, using this seemingly ordinary occupation as cover for his underground political activities.[^12] On the surface, he appeared to be a simple shopkeeper trying to make a living under colonial rule. In reality, Na was building networks among local patriots and laying the groundwork for resistance activities that would soon thrust him into the forefront of the independence struggle.

## Rise to Revolutionary Action

The March 1st Movement of 1919 marked a turning point in Na Seok-ju's life and in the broader Korean independence struggle. On March 1, 1919, thirty-three Korean cultural and religious leaders issued a declaration of independence, sparking a nationwide wave of peaceful protests that would become one of the largest anti-colonial demonstrations in modern history.[^13] Over the following two months, more than 1,500 protest gatherings took place across Korea, with participation from approximately two million people.[^14]

Na Seok-ju played an active role in organizing these demonstrations in his local area. In Gyeomipo (겸이포), Na helped coordinate independence demonstrations and raised his voice alongside thousands of others calling for Korea's freedom.[^15] More significantly, he took on the dangerous work of organizing resistance cells, recruiting members for armed struggle, and raising funds for Korean nationalist militant groups operating in exile.[^16] This grassroots organizing was essential to sustaining the independence movement, as funds raised in Korea helped support the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai and armed guerrilla units operating along the Manchurian border.

The Japanese colonial authorities responded to the March 1st Movement with extreme brutality. Japanese military and police forces killed at least 7,509 Korean civilians, injured 45,000 more, and arrested over 47,000 people.[^17] They employed tactics of collective punishment, burning entire villages, destroying schools, and torturing arrested protesters.[^18] The Jeamri Church massacre, in which Japanese soldiers locked Korean Christians inside a church and burned them alive, became a symbol of colonial atrocities.[^19] Rather than crushing the independence spirit, however, this violence only strengthened Korean resolve and pushed many activists toward more militant forms of resistance.

In 1920, Na Seok-ju's underground activities escalated to direct action. He was implicated in the killings of multiple Japanese colonial authorities in his region, as well as the execution of a Korean man believed to be collaborating with the Japanese occupation government.[^20] These targeted assassinations of colonial officials and collaborators were part of a broader strategy employed by independence activists to undermine Japanese control and punish those seen as betraying the Korean nation. However, these actions also put Na at the top of the Japanese colonial police's wanted list.

On September 22, 1920, with Japanese authorities closing in, Na was forced to flee Korea.[^21] He made the dangerous journey across the border to Shanghai, China, where the Korean Provisional Government had established its headquarters following the March 1st Movement.[^22] Shanghai had become the nerve center of the Korean independence movement in exile, hosting not only the Provisional Government but also numerous revolutionary organizations, newspapers, and activist groups. The city's international settlement provided a degree of protection from Japanese authorities, though assassinations and kidnappings of Korean activists by Japanese agents were not uncommon.

## Life in Exile and the Provisional Government

In Shanghai, Na Seok-ju found purpose and community among fellow Korean exiles dedicated to winning independence through armed struggle. He joined the Korean Provisional Government's security apparatus, serving as a bodyguard for the organization's leadership.[^23] This position placed him in close contact with some of the most important figures in the independence movement, including Kim Gu (Kim Ku), who would become one of modern Korea's most revered patriots.

The Korean Provisional Government, established on April 11, 1919, represented the Korean people's attempt to create a government-in-exile that could coordinate resistance activities, conduct diplomacy with foreign powers, and provide political legitimacy to the independence struggle.[^24] Kim Gu served in various leadership roles within the Provisional Government throughout the 1920s, including as acting Prime Minister, Minister of Internal Affairs, and Minister of Labor.[^25] He was known for his uncompromising commitment to independence and his willingness to employ militant tactics against the Japanese Empire.

Na Seok-ju developed a particularly close relationship with Kim Gu during his years in Shanghai. Their bond went beyond the formal superior-subordinate relationship typical of political organizations. In one touching incident that reveals the depth of their friendship, Na sold his own clothes at a pawnshop to buy meat and cold noodles for Kim Gu's 49th birthday celebration on August 29, 1925.[^26] Kim Gu had recently lost his wife, and Na's gesture of sacrificing his own possessions to bring some comfort to his grieving leader exemplified the personal bonds that sustained Korean revolutionaries through years of hardship in exile.

During his time in Shanghai, Na would have witnessed the intense debates that divided the independence movement. Some activists, including Syngman Rhee, advocated for diplomatic approaches and appealing to Western powers for support. Others, like Kim Gu and the militant organizations, believed that armed struggle and direct action were necessary to drive the Japanese from Korea.[^27] The Provisional Government struggled with internal divisions, limited resources, and the practical challenge of directing resistance activities inside Korea from thousands of miles away.

Na also made connections with other revolutionary organizations during this period. In 1926, he joined the Uiyeoldan (義烈團), also known as the Righteous Corps or Heroic Corps, a militant anarchist organization founded by Kim Won-bong on November 9, 1919.[^28] The Uiyeoldan was dedicated to armed resistance against Japanese colonial rule through assassinations and bombings of colonial officials and institutions.[^29] The organization had a clear revolutionary program, identifying "7 types of people who must be killed" (including high-ranking Japanese officials, pro-Japanese collaborators, and traitors) and "5 government structures that must be destroyed" (key institutions of colonial control).[^30] Between 1919 and the early 1930s, the Uiyeoldan conducted over 200 operations against Japanese targets.[^31]

While in China, Na also traveled to Tianjin to meet with Kim Chang-suk, another leader in the Provisional Government network.[^32] It was during this meeting that Na received his final mission: to return to Korea and strike at the heart of Japanese economic exploitation by bombing the Oriental Development Company, the Bank of Chōsen (Joseon), and the Chōsen Industrial Bank in Seoul.[^33] These three institutions were the pillars of Japanese economic control over Korea, and an attack on them would carry enormous symbolic weight while also disrupting colonial financial operations.

## The December 28, 1926 Attack

By late 1926, Na Seok-ju had made his decision. He would return to Korea and carry out a spectacular act of resistance that would remind both Koreans and Japanese that the independence struggle was far from over. The mission was extraordinarily dangerous—Na would be operating alone in the heavily policed colonial capital, targeting institutions at the very center of Japanese power, with no realistic prospect of escape.

On December 26, 1926, Na departed from Manchuria and began the dangerous journey south toward Seoul.[^34] He traveled disguised to avoid detection, employing various false identities and cover stories as he crossed the Chinese-Korean border and passed through numerous checkpoints manned by Japanese colonial police and Korean collaborators.[^35] Every checkpoint presented a risk of discovery and arrest. The fact that he successfully navigated these obstacles and reached Seoul demonstrated both his courage and his skill at clandestine operations.

Na arrived in Seoul on December 28, 1926, carrying grenades and a pistol.[^36] His targets were carefully chosen for maximum symbolic impact. The Oriental Development Company represented the systematic theft of Korean land and the impoverishment of Korean farmers. The Bank of Chōsen, established in 1909, served as the colonial bank of issue and had been described as "a primary component of Japanese foreign expansionism."[^37] The Chōsen Industrial Bank, together with the Oriental Development Company, formed the dual pillars of Japanese economic domination of Korea.[^38]

At approximately 1:00 PM on December 28, Na entered the Chōsen Industrial Bank (조선식산은행) building.[^39] He walked into the loan department and threw a grenade, causing a massive explosion that killed and wounded multiple people inside the building.[^40] The blast sent shockwaves through the colonial financial district and immediately triggered a massive police response.

Without hesitating, Na fled the bank and made his way to his primary target: the Oriental Development Company building located nearby.[^41] As he entered the building, he drew his pistol and opened fire on Japanese office workers and officials inside.[^42] He shot and killed three people, including Japanese police officers and employees of the Oriental Development Company, and seriously wounded four others.[^43] Na then climbed the stairs to the upper floors, seeking out higher-ranking officials. He threw another grenade into the technical section manager's office, but this explosive proved to be faulty and failed to detonate properly.[^44]

By this time, dozens of Japanese police officers were converging on the building. Na attempted to fight his way out, engaging in a running gun battle with the pursuing officers.[^45] He managed to shoot and kill at least one police officer during his attempted escape.[^46] As he ran through the streets near the Oriental Development Company, more police closed in from multiple directions. Realizing that capture was imminent, Na made his final stand.

According to eyewitness accounts, as Japanese police surrounded him, Na shouted to the gathered crowd of Korean onlookers: "I am fighting for the freedom of my country. Twenty million compatriots, struggle without rest!"[^47] These words—his final public statement—encapsulated his life's purpose and served as a call to action for all Koreans suffering under colonial rule. The phrase "twenty million" referred to the approximate population of Korea at the time, emphasizing that the independence struggle was not the work of isolated radicals but represented the aspirations of an entire nation.

Rather than allow himself to be taken alive and subjected to torture, interrogation, and a show trial, Na Seok-ju turned his gun on himself and fired three shots into his own chest.[^48] He collapsed in the street, critically wounded. Japanese police rushed him to a hospital, hoping to save him for questioning and eventual execution. However, Na's injuries were too severe. He died later that day, December 28, 1926, at the age of 34.[^49]

---

## Immediate Aftermath and Japanese Response

The attack sent shockwaves through Japanese colonial society in Korea and through the Japanese government in Tokyo. The fact that a lone Korean activist had penetrated the heart of Seoul's colonial financial district and carried out a coordinated attack on two major institutions exposed serious vulnerabilities in colonial security. Japanese newspapers and colonial authorities initially attempted to characterize Na as a deranged criminal or isolated extremist, trying to minimize the political significance of his actions.[^50]

However, the Japanese could not hide the deeper truth: Na's attack demonstrated that Korean resistance to colonial rule remained strong despite decades of repression. The targeting of the Oriental Development Company and colonial banks was particularly significant because these institutions symbolized economic exploitation that affected virtually every Korean family. By attacking these institutions, Na struck at the material foundations of Japanese imperialism in Korea.

In the days following the attack, Japanese colonial police launched sweeping arrests of suspected independence activists and their family members throughout Seoul and Hwanghae Province.[^51] They interrogated dozens of people connected to Na, trying to uncover any broader conspiracy or network. The colonial government increased security around all major Japanese institutions and tightened surveillance of Koreans throughout the capital. Japanese officials also pressured Chinese authorities in Shanghai and Manchuria to crack down on Korean exile communities, though with limited success.

The colonial press published articles warning of the "Korean terrorist threat" and justifying harsh security measures. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary statements from this period reflect the government's determination to characterize Korean independence activists as criminals rather than political actors.[^52] This framing was essential to Japanese colonial ideology, which insisted that Korean annexation was legitimate and beneficial, and that only a small minority of malcontents opposed Japanese rule.

## Korean Response and Growing Legend

Among Koreans, both in the peninsula and in exile communities, Na Seok-ju's attack provoked a very different reaction. News of his deed spread rapidly through underground networks and word of mouth, as Koreans carefully discussed the event beyond the hearing of Japanese authorities and collaborators. For many Koreans suffering under the weight of colonial oppression, Na became an instant hero—a man who had given his life to strike back at the institutions that had stolen their land and destroyed their livelihoods.

In Shanghai, Kim Gu and other leaders of the Provisional Government mourned Na's death while celebrating his courage and sacrifice. Kim Gu later wrote about Na in his memoir, praising his dedication and recounting the close personal relationship they had shared.[^53] The attack reinforced Kim Gu's conviction that armed struggle was a necessary and legitimate means of pursuing independence.

Within Korea, Na's final words—"I am fighting for the freedom of my country. Twenty million compatriots, struggle without rest!"—were repeated in whispers among independence sympathizers and became a rallying cry for continued resistance.[^54] The fact that Na had chosen to die rather than be captured alive resonated deeply in Korean culture, which had a long tradition honoring righteous fighters who sacrificed themselves for principle. Korean history was filled with stories of loyal subjects and righteous armies (의병) who chose death over surrender to invaders, and Na's actions fit squarely within this heroic tradition.[^55]

Underground newspapers and publications produced by Korean exile communities published accounts of Na's attack, ensuring that his story would not be forgotten. These publications emphasized that Na's target selection—the Oriental Development Company and colonial banks—demonstrated sophisticated political consciousness, not mindless violence. The articles noted that these institutions had been responsible for the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Korean families, including Na's own.[^56]

Young Koreans, particularly students and intellectuals who chafed under colonial restrictions, were especially inspired by Na's example. His willingness to sacrifice his life for the cause represented an ideal of selfless patriotism that stood in stark contrast to the collaboration and accommodation that Japanese authorities demanded of Koreans. In the years following Na's death, other young activists would follow his example, carrying out their own attacks against symbols of Japanese colonial power.

## Major Achievements and Historical Significance

Na Seok-ju's achievements must be understood primarily in symbolic rather than military terms. While his attack killed three people and wounded several others, and while it caused some physical damage to the targeted buildings, it did not significantly disrupt Japanese colonial operations in any material sense. The Oriental Development Company and colonial banks quickly repaired the damage and continued their exploitation of Korean resources. Japanese colonial control over Korea remained firm until Japan's defeat in World War II in 1945.

However, the symbolic impact of Na's deed was profound and lasting. First, his attack demonstrated that Japanese colonial rule in Korea was vulnerable and contested. No matter how many police officers the colonial government deployed, no matter how extensive their surveillance networks, they could not prevent determined individuals from striking at the heart of the colonial system. This message was important for both Koreans and the Japanese: it told Koreans that resistance was possible, and it told the Japanese that their control was never complete or secure.

Second, Na's careful selection of targets showed political sophistication and strategic thinking. He did not attack random Japanese civilians or strike at targets of mere convenience. Instead, he targeted institutions that were central to the economic exploitation of Korea and that symbolized the material suffering of ordinary Korean families. The Oriental Development Company, which had confiscated over one-third of Korea's arable land and displaced hundreds of thousands of Korean farmers, was perhaps the single most hated institution of Japanese colonial rule.[^57] By attacking this company, Na struck a blow that resonated with the lived experience of millions of Koreans.

Third, Na's final words and his choice to die rather than be captured created a powerful martyrdom that inspired subsequent generations of Korean independence activists. The image of a lone patriot standing against overwhelming odds, shouting defiance with his last breath, became an enduring symbol of Korean resistance. This narrative power should not be underestimated; movements for national liberation depend on such symbols to maintain morale and commitment during long periods when victory seems impossible.

Fourth, Na's attack was part of a broader pattern of militant resistance in the 1920s that kept the independence issue alive on the international stage. Throughout this decade, Korean activists carried out numerous acts of armed resistance, both inside Korea and against Japanese targets in China and beyond. These actions ensured that the world could not simply accept Japan's claim that Korea had peacefully accepted annexation and that colonial rule was uncontested. Each attack, each assassination, each act of sabotage testified to the continuing Korean struggle for self-determination.

Fifth, Na's connection to the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai helped demonstrate the organizational capacity of the Korean independence movement. The fact that exiled Korean leaders could plan operations inside Korea, that activists could travel between China and Korea despite Japanese border controls, and that networks of supporters could provide intelligence and assistance—all of this pointed to a genuine political movement rather than isolated acts of individual violence.

Finally, Na Seok-ju's life story—from farming family to dispossessed tenant to military trainee to revolutionary—exemplified the radicalization process that Japanese colonial policies created. The Japanese often characterized Korean independence activists as extremists divorced from the Korean population. In reality, activists like Na were products of Japanese colonial violence and economic exploitation. Their radicalization was a direct response to the dispossession, humiliation, and brutality that colonialism inflicted on ordinary Koreans.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Na Seok-ju's legacy remains contested, with evaluations of his actions varying dramatically depending on national perspective, political ideology, and definitions of legitimate political violence. These debates raise fundamental questions about the ethics of armed resistance, the boundaries between terrorism and freedom fighting, and how nations construct historical memory around contested events.

### The Terrorism Debate

The most fundamental controversy surrounding Na Seok-ju centers on whether he should be characterized as a terrorist or a freedom fighter. Japanese authorities at the time, and some contemporary Japanese officials, have labeled Korean independence activists as terrorists and criminals. In 2013, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide referred to another Korean independence activist, Ahn Jung-geun, as "a terrorist who was sentenced to death for murdering Ito Hirobumi, our first prime minister."[^58] This framing implicitly applies to all Korean activists who used violence against Japanese targets, including Na Seok-ju.

From this perspective, Na's attack on the Oriental Development Company and colonial banks killed and wounded civilians in a public space, and his actions fit dictionary definitions of terrorism as "the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims." Swedish scholar from SOAS, University of London, comparing Korean independence activists to terrorists in 2007, provoked strong criticism but also highlighted how the term "terrorism" is applied differently depending on political perspective.[^59]

Critics of Na's methods argue that attacking financial institutions where civilian employees worked crossed ethical boundaries. The people killed in Na's attack included office workers and bank employees who, while they worked for colonial institutions, were not themselves making policy or directing colonial oppression. From this viewpoint, violence should be strictly limited to military targets or political leaders directly responsible for colonial policies, not extended to anyone associated with colonial institutions.

### The Freedom Fighter Perspective

The counter-argument, embraced by most Koreans and many international observers, holds that Na Seok-ju was a legitimate independence fighter targeting military and governmental symbols of an oppressive colonial regime. From this perspective, the Oriental Development Company and colonial banks were not innocent financial institutions but rather instruments of systematic exploitation and theft on a massive scale.

Supporters of this view note that the Oriental Development Company had confiscated over one-third of Korea's arable land, directly causing the impoverishment and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Korean families.[^60] The colonial banks provided the financial infrastructure for resource extraction and the economic subordination of Korea to Japanese interests.[^61] These were not neutral economic actors but core components of a colonial system that inflicted violence on millions of Koreans through legal dispossession, cultural suppression, and systematic discrimination.

This perspective emphasizes that under international law, peoples subject to foreign occupation have a right to resist, including through armed struggle. Korean independence activists were fighting against an occupying power that had illegally annexed their country, suppressed their language and culture, and engaged in systematic exploitation. The Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910 was achieved through military threats and diplomatic manipulation, not through free consent of the Korean people.[^62]

Furthermore, defenders of Na's legacy point out that the March 1st Movement's peaceful protests in 1919 had been met with massive violence by Japanese colonial authorities, who killed thousands of unarmed Korean civilians.[^63] After demonstrating that peaceful resistance would be brutally crushed, how could Japan then claim that Koreans had no right to armed resistance? From this viewpoint, Na's violence was a response to the structural and physical violence of colonialism itself.

Chinese President Chiang Kai-shek, speaking about another Korean independence activist's bombing attack, called the activist "a young Korean patriot who has accomplished something tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers could not do."[^64] This reflects how other Asian peoples fighting against Japanese imperialism viewed Korean activists—not as terrorists, but as fellow anti-colonial fighters deserving of admiration and support.

### The Civilian Casualties Question

A more nuanced criticism, even among those sympathetic to Korean independence, concerns the ethics of attacks that kill people not directly involved in policymaking or military operations. While the Oriental Development Company as an institution was a legitimate target from an anti-colonial perspective, were the individual office workers who happened to be in the building that day legitimate targets?

This question has no easy answer. Some argue that anyone working for a colonial institution bears some degree of moral responsibility for its actions, particularly Japanese citizens who had traveled to Korea specifically to participate in and benefit from colonial exploitation. Others maintain that a bank clerk or office worker cannot be held personally responsible for institutional policies and that targeting them violates ethical principles that should govern armed resistance.

Na Seok-ju himself appears to have accepted that his mission would likely result in casualties among people who were not themselves high-level decision-makers. His primary targets were the institutions themselves and their senior officials, but he proceeded with his attack knowing that others would likely be killed or wounded. Whether this represents unacceptable callousness toward human life or a tragic but unavoidable consequence of striking at powerful institutions depends largely on one's broader ethical framework and political perspective.

### The Effectiveness Question

Some historians and political analysts have questioned whether attacks like Na's were strategically effective in advancing the goal of Korean independence. From this viewpoint, such attacks may have provided emotional satisfaction and symbolic victories, but they did not materially weaken Japanese colonial rule and may have actually strengthened it by providing justification for harsher repression.

This criticism notes that Japan did not grant Korea independence until 1945, following Japan's military defeat by the Allied powers in World War II. Korean independence was ultimately achieved through Japan's surrender to external military pressure, not through the accumulated impact of resistance activities inside Korea or by exiled activists. From this perspective, Na Seok-ju's sacrifice, while personally courageous, did not advance the practical goal of independence and may have been strategically counterproductive.

However, defenders of militant resistance argue that this critique ignores the importance of maintaining resistance identity and demonstrating continuing opposition to colonial rule. Without continuous resistance activities throughout the colonial period, Korean national consciousness might have eroded, and the international community might have accepted Japanese claims that Korea had been peacefully incorporated into the Japanese Empire. Resistance kept the independence issue alive and ensured that when Japan was defeated in 1945, Korea would be recognized as a nation entitled to restored sovereignty rather than as a rebellious province of Japan.

### Historical Memory and National Identity

In contemporary South Korea, Na Seok-ju is honored as a patriot and independence hero, with a statue erected at the site of his attack and posthumous recognition from the government.[^65] This reflects a national consensus that Korean independence activists deserve honor regardless of the methods they employed. However, this consensus is not universally shared internationally, and debates continue about how to characterize armed resistance movements against colonial rule.

These controversies reflect deeper questions about historical justice, the ethics of political violence, and how nations construct narratives about their past. There is unlikely to ever be universal agreement on how to evaluate Na Seok-ju's actions, as these evaluations depend on prior moral and political commitments that differ across communities and nations.

## Personal Life and Character

Relatively little is known about Na Seok-ju's personal life, particularly his inner thoughts, beliefs, and relationships beyond his political activities. Like many revolutionary activists of his era, Na left behind few personal writings, and what we know about him comes primarily from organizational records, Japanese police files, and accounts written by his comrades years later. Nevertheless, the available evidence allows us to sketch some aspects of his personality and private life.

Na came from a farming family in Hwanghae Province and experienced firsthand the loss of land and status that Japanese colonialism inflicted on Korean rural families. This personal experience of dispossession appears to have been a driving force in his political development. Unlike some independence activists who came from elite backgrounds and developed political consciousness through education and exposure to nationalist ideas, Na's radicalization was rooted in concrete material suffering. The land his family had worked for generations was taken by the Oriental Development Company, reducing them from independent farmers to impoverished tenants.[^66] This personal grievance gave his later attack on that same company a quality of direct retaliation against the institution that had destroyed his family's livelihood.

Those who knew Na in Shanghai described him as deeply committed and willing to endure personal hardship for the cause. The incident in which he sold his own clothes to buy food for Kim Gu's birthday reveals several aspects of his character: personal loyalty, willingness to sacrifice his own comfort for others, and a deep sense of solidarity with fellow exiles.[^67] This was not a man pursuing revolution for personal glory or gain, but someone who had genuinely subordinated his individual interests to the collective struggle for independence.

Na appears to have been unmarried and without children, or at least no family members are mentioned in historical records. This was not uncommon among independence activists, many of whom avoided marriage and family responsibilities because their dangerous activities made stable family life impossible and could put loved ones at risk. Japanese colonial authorities frequently arrested and tortured family members of independence activists, using threats against relatives as leverage to extract information or force compliance.

His decision to undergo four years of military training in Manchuria demonstrates patience, discipline, and long-term commitment. Military training in the harsh conditions of Manchuria, away from home and family, living in exile among fellow Korean refugees and activists, required considerable fortitude. That Na completed this training and then returned to Korea to engage in underground organizing shows that he was not impulsive, but rather methodical in preparing himself for revolutionary activity.

The final moments of Na's life reveal perhaps the most important aspects of his character. Surrounded by Japanese police, knowing death was imminent, he chose to address his final words not to his pursuers but to his fellow Koreans: "I am fighting for the freedom of my country. Twenty million compatriots, struggle without rest!"[^68] These words suggest a man deeply focused on the collective cause rather than personal fate. Even as he prepared to die, his concern was to inspire others to continue the struggle. This represented a fundamentally selfless orientation—he saw his own death as meaningful only insofar as it contributed to the larger movement for independence.

His choice to shoot himself rather than be captured also reveals something about his character and values. In Korean cultural tradition, there was a long history of warriors and loyal subjects who chose death over capture when facing impossible odds. The righteous armies (의병) that had fought against Japanese encroachment in the years before annexation often fought to the death rather than surrender.[^69] By following this tradition, Na placed himself in a lineage of Korean resistance and signaled that he valued honor and continued defiance over survival.

Some accounts suggest that Na was quiet and reserved in demeanor, not given to grand speeches or self-promotion. If accurate, this would fit the profile of many effective revolutionary operatives—people who were committed to the cause rather than personal recognition, willing to work behind the scenes and take enormous risks without seeking public acclaim. The fact that Na is less well-known internationally than some other Korean independence activists like Ahn Jung-geun may partially reflect this reserved personality.

It is important to acknowledge the limitations of our knowledge about Na's personal life. We do not know his favorite foods, what books he read, whether he wrote poetry, what he found beautiful, what made him laugh, what he feared, or what private doubts he may have harbored. Revolutionary activists, particularly those who die young in dramatic circumstances, often become simplified into symbols—the totality of their humanity reduced to their political acts. Na Seok-ju was undoubtedly a more complex person than the historical record preserves, with hopes, contradictions, weaknesses, and dimensions of character that have been lost to history.

## Legacy and Historical Memory

Na Seok-ju's legacy in Korea is that of a patriot who sacrificed his life fighting for national independence during one of the darkest periods in Korean history. His story has been preserved and honored through multiple forms of commemoration, education, and public memory in South Korea, ensuring that subsequent generations of Koreans understand his sacrifice as part of the broader struggle against Japanese colonialism.

### Posthumous Recognition

On March 1, 1962, the South Korean government under President Park Chung-hee posthumously awarded Na Seok-ju and 203 other independence activists the Order of Merit for National Foundation (Geongukhunjang), specifically the Presidential Class (대통령장).[^70] This honor represented the highest recognition the Republic of Korea could bestow on those who had fought for independence. The 1962 ceremony was significant because it came decades after the independence activists had died, reflecting the failure of the Syngman Rhee government (1948-1960) to properly recognize independence activists during their lifetimes or immediately after liberation.[^71]

The Order of Merit for National Foundation was specifically established to honor those who contributed to Korea's independence and the founding of the Republic of Korea. That Na received the highest class of this order (Presidential Class) placed him among the most honored independence activists in Korean history, alongside figures like Ahn Jung-geun, Yun Bong-gil, and others who had carried out dramatic acts of resistance against Japanese colonial rule.

### Physical Memorials

A statue of Na Seok-ju was erected in Seoul at the site of his attack, in front of the Hana Financial Group headquarters building in Euljiro, Jung-gu—the location where the Oriental Development Company building once stood.[^72] The statue depicts Na in action, serving as a physical reminder to passersby of his sacrifice and the history of resistance against colonialism. The decision to place this statue at the exact site of his attack is significant, transforming a location once symbolizing colonial exploitation into a space commemorating Korean resistance.

The statue has become a site of pilgrimage for Korean students, activists, and citizens who wish to honor Na's memory. On significant dates in Korean history, particularly March 1st (Independence Movement Day) and August 15th (Liberation Day), people often visit the statue to lay flowers and pay respects. These rituals of public memory help transmit the story of independence struggle from older to younger generations.

### Educational Curriculum

Na Seok-ju's story is taught in South Korean schools as part of the modern history curriculum covering the Japanese colonial period. Korean students learn about the March 1st Movement, the Korean Provisional Government, and specific independence activists including Na Seok-ju. Educational materials present him as an example of patriotic sacrifice and resistance against foreign domination. This incorporation into formal education ensures that virtually all South Koreans encounter his story at some point during their schooling.

However, the way Na's story is taught reflects broader debates about violence and national history. Educational materials generally present his attack in the context of legitimate resistance against colonial oppression, avoiding characterizations of terrorism and emphasizing the injustices of colonial rule that motivated such actions. Critics have sometimes argued that this approach romanticizes political violence, while defenders maintain that understanding historical context is essential to evaluating past actions fairly.

### Scholarly Research and Publications

Korean historians have produced numerous scholarly works examining Na Seok-ju's life and the broader context of militant independence activism in the 1920s. These works have uncovered archival materials, including Japanese police records, letters written by Na and his comrades, and documents from the Korean Provisional Government. In 2024, the Korea Heritage Service announced the public exhibition of previously unknown letters written by Na that shed light on his planning for the December 1926 attack.[^73] These letters revealed the careful thought and strategic consideration that went into selecting targets, obtaining weapons, and coordinating with independence leaders in China.

Academic research has also explored Na's connections to broader networks of Korean independence activism, including his relationships with Kim Gu, the Uiyeoldan, and other militant organizations. This scholarship has helped contextualize Na's individual actions within the larger history of Korean resistance to Japanese imperialism.

### Cultural Representations

Na Seok-ju has been portrayed in various forms of Korean popular culture, including films, television dramas, documentaries, and literature about the independence movement. While not as frequently depicted as some other independence activists, his story has appeared in productions that dramatize the Korean independence struggle. These cultural representations have helped keep his memory alive in Korean popular consciousness and have introduced his story to audiences who might not encounter it through formal education.

### Comparative Legacy

Within the pantheon of Korean independence heroes, Na Seok-ju occupies an important but not preeminent position. He is less internationally known than figures like Ahn Jung-geun (who assassinated Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi in 1909) or Yu Gwan-sun (a young woman who died in prison after participating in the March 1st Movement). His legacy is more comparable to other militant activists of the 1920s who carried out targeted attacks against colonial institutions, such as Yun Bong-gil (who bombed Japanese military leaders in Shanghai in 1932).

What distinguishes Na's legacy is the symbolic power of his final words and his targeting of economic institutions that had directly impoverished Korean families. While some independence activists attacked Japanese political or military leaders, Na struck at the institutions of economic exploitation, making his resistance particularly resonant for ordinary Koreans who had experienced land confiscation and economic dispossession.

### Contemporary Relevance

In contemporary South Korea, Na Seok-ju's memory is sometimes invoked in discussions about national identity, historical justice, and relations with Japan. When tensions arise between South Korea and Japan over historical issues—such as Japanese politicians visiting the Yasukuni Shrine (which honors convicted war criminals) or disputes over wartime forced labor and sexual slavery—Na's story is sometimes referenced as a reminder of Korean suffering under colonialism and the importance of remembering resistance.

His legacy also features in ongoing debates about how to evaluate the complex history of the Japanese colonial period. Some South Korean conservatives have occasionally questioned whether armed resistance was strategically wise or whether accommodation with Japanese rule might have better served Korean interests. In response, progressives and nationalists point to figures like Na Seok-ju as embodiments of the Korean spirit of resistance and self-determination, arguing that honor and independence were worth any sacrifice.

### International Recognition

Outside Korea, Na Seok-ju remains relatively unknown compared to other Asian anti-colonial figures. This reflects both the specific nature of his activities (domestic attack within Korea rather than international incident) and the broader historical pattern of Korean independence activism receiving less international attention than anti-colonial struggles in other regions. Nevertheless, scholars of Asian history and colonialism recognize Na as part of the broader pattern of armed resistance to Japanese imperialism that occurred throughout Japan's colonial empire in Korea, Taiwan, and Manchuria.

Chinese historians and commemoration practices have sometimes acknowledged Korean independence activists including Na, recognizing the common struggle against Japanese imperialism. The Korean Provisional Government operated in Chinese territory with tacit Chinese support, and many Chinese understood Korean independence activists as allies in resisting Japanese expansion in East Asia.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments of Na Seok-ju within South Korea have been overwhelmingly positive, viewing him as a patriot who sacrificed his life for Korean independence. Korean historians emphasize several aspects of his legacy that deserve positive recognition and commemoration.

First, Korean scholars highlight Na's courage and commitment in the face of overwhelming odds. Choosing to return to heavily policed colonial Seoul to carry out an attack against major Japanese institutions, knowing that success would likely mean death, required extraordinary bravery. The fact that Na successfully infiltrated Seoul, reached his targets, carried out the attack, and maintained his composure even in his final moments demonstrates exceptional courage and dedication to the independence cause.[^74]

Second, positive assessments emphasize Na's strategic intelligence in selecting targets. Unlike some resistance activities that struck at symbolic but strategically insignificant targets, Na attacked institutions that were central to Japanese colonial exploitation. The Oriental Development Company was perhaps the single most hated institution of colonial rule, responsible for the dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Korean families.[^75] By targeting this company along with colonial banks, Na struck at the material foundations of Japanese imperialism, not merely its symbols. This demonstrated political sophistication and an understanding of the structural dimensions of colonial oppression.

Third, Korean historians view Na as representing the radicalization of ordinary Koreans caused by colonial policies. He was not from the elite yangban class or the educated urban intelligentsia—he came from a farming family that directly experienced land confiscation and economic devastation at the hands of colonial authorities.[^76] His turn to armed resistance represented the response of common Koreans to the injustices they suffered, not merely the ideological commitment of educated radicals. This makes his story particularly important as evidence that resistance to Japanese rule was rooted in genuine popular grievances, not imposed by outside agitators as Japanese propaganda often claimed.

Fourth, positive assessments emphasize the moral clarity of Na's final words: "I am fighting for the freedom of my country. Twenty million compatriots, struggle without rest!"[^77] These words demonstrated that his actions were motivated by patriotic concern for collective liberation rather than personal grievance or nihilistic violence. Even in his final moments, his thoughts were directed toward inspiring continued resistance by his fellow Koreans. This selfless orientation has been cited as exemplifying the highest ideals of patriotism and sacrifice for the common good.

Fifth, Korean scholars appreciate that Na's sacrifice helped maintain resistance spirit during a period when many Koreans were becoming discouraged by the apparent permanence of Japanese rule. The 1920s were a difficult period for the independence movement, following the brutal suppression of the March 1st Movement and with Japanese colonial control becoming more entrenched. Acts of resistance like Na's reminded Koreans that the struggle continued and that colonialism remained contested, helping to sustain hope and commitment to eventual liberation.[^78]

Sixth, Na's close relationship with Kim Gu and the Korean Provisional Government is viewed positively as demonstrating the organizational capacity and coordination of the independence movement. He was not a lone wolf acting independently, but part of a broader network of activists working together across international borders to resist colonialism. This connection to larger organizational structures is seen as evidence that Korean independence activism represented a genuine political movement with leadership, strategy, and coordination, not merely scattered acts of individual violence.[^79]

### Negative Views and Critical Perspectives

While negative assessments of Na Seok-ju within South Korea are rare and generally considered politically controversial, some critical perspectives exist both within Korea and internationally that question aspects of his legacy and the tactics of armed resistance he employed.

The most significant criticism, discussed earlier, concerns the ethics of attacks that result in civilian casualties. Even among those sympathetic to Korean independence, some scholars have questioned whether targeting institutions like banks where civilian employees worked crossed ethical boundaries that should govern armed resistance. From this perspective, violence should be strictly limited to military forces or political leaders directly responsible for colonial policies, not extended to anyone who happens to work for colonial institutions. Critics note that office workers at the Oriental Development Company, while employed by a colonial institution, were not themselves making policy decisions about land confiscation and may have included lower-level employees who had limited alternatives for employment.[^80]

A second criticism concerns strategic effectiveness. Some historians and political analysts argue that attacks like Na's, while emotionally satisfying and symbolically powerful, did not materially weaken Japanese colonial rule and may have been counterproductive by providing justification for harsher repression. From this viewpoint, Korean independence was ultimately achieved through Japan's military defeat in World War II, not through accumulated acts of resistance within Korea. This critique suggests that Na's sacrifice, while personally courageous, did not advance the practical goal of independence and that energy devoted to armed resistance might have been better spent on other forms of organization and resistance.[^81]

A third critical perspective, more common outside Korea than within it, questions the lionization of political violence and martyrdom in national memory. From this viewpoint, while Na's actions may have been understandable given the context of colonial oppression, celebrating them risks romanticizing violence and potentially inspiring contemporary acts of political violence that lack the same historical justification. This criticism argues that national memory should emphasize nonviolent resistance, diplomatic efforts, and cultural preservation rather than armed attacks, even when those attacks targeted colonial institutions.

Some Japanese scholars and officials have characterized Na and other Korean independence activists as terrorists, emphasizing that their attacks killed people who were not involved in military operations or high-level policy decisions. As mentioned earlier, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide's 2013 characterization of another Korean activist as a "terrorist" reflects official Japanese government perspectives that implicitly apply to all Korean activists who used violence, including Na Seok-ju.[^82] This framing is rejected by virtually all Koreans and most international scholars as an attempt to delegitimize legitimate anti-colonial resistance, but it remains an official position of some Japanese conservatives.

A more nuanced critique from within Korean progressive circles questions whether contemporary South Korea's commemoration of independence activists like Na sufficiently engages with the complexities and ethical dilemmas of political violence. This perspective argues that while honoring independence activists is appropriate, historical education should also acknowledge the tragic dimensions of colonial resistance—the fact that colonialism created circumstances where courageous young people felt that sacrificing their lives in violent attacks was necessary. From this viewpoint, the true evil was Japanese colonialism that created such circumstances, and contemporary commemoration should emphasize the injustice of colonial systems that drive people to such desperate measures, rather than simply celebrating individual acts of violence.

Finally, some historians have noted that the emphasis on militant male activists in Korean independence commemoration has sometimes overshadowed the contributions of women activists, nonviolent resistance, cultural preservation efforts, and the daily resistance of ordinary Koreans who maintained Korean identity and solidarity under colonial rule. While this is not a direct criticism of Na Seok-ju himself, it suggests that the broader narrative of independence struggle should be expanded to include multiple forms of resistance beyond dramatic armed attacks by male activists.

Despite these critical perspectives, it is important to note that Na Seok-ju's overall legacy in South Korea remains strongly positive. The critical views presented above represent minority perspectives or international viewpoints that are generally rejected within Korean historical consciousness. The dominant narrative in South Korea views Na as a patriot and hero whose sacrifice deserves continuing honor and remembrance.

## Famous Quotes

> "I am fighting for the freedom of my country. Twenty million compatriots, struggle without rest!" (나는 조국의 자유를 위해 투쟁했다. 2천만 민중아, 분투하여 쉬지 말라!)

These were Na Seok-ju's final words, shouted to the crowd of Korean onlookers as Japanese police surrounded him on December 28, 1926, moments before he shot himself. The phrase "twenty million" referred to the population of Korea at the time, emphasizing that the independence struggle represented the aspirations of the entire Korean nation.[^83]

> "I sold my clothes so that you might have a better birthday."

Na said this to Kim Gu on August 29, 1925, when he presented food he had purchased for Kim's 49th birthday by pawning his own clothes. The gesture demonstrated the deep personal bonds that sustained independence activists through years of hardship in exile.[^84]

> "The Oriental Development Company must be destroyed for stealing Korean land and destroying Korean families."

According to accounts from his comrades, Na expressed this sentiment when explaining his target selection for the December 1926 attack. While the exact wording varies in different sources, the sentiment reflects his understanding that the Oriental Development Company symbolized the economic exploitation at the heart of colonialism.[^85]
