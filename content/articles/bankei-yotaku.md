## Summary

Bankei Yotaku was a Japanese Rinzai Zen master famous for his teaching of the 'Unborn' (fusho) — the original, innate Buddha-mind that is always present. He rejected the use of koans and complex practices, teaching that people need only recognize the unborn Buddha-mind they already possess. His sermons attracted enormous crowds of both commoners and samurai. He is considered one of the most original Zen masters in Japanese history.
