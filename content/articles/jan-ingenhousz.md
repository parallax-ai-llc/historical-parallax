## Summary

Jan Ingenhousz was a Dutch-British physiologist who discovered photosynthesis. In 1779, he showed that plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen in the presence of sunlight, but in darkness they absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide. This fundamental discovery of photosynthesis explained how plants produce food and oxygen. He also introduced smallpox inoculation to the Austrian royal family.
