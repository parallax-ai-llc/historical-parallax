## Summary

Alexander II of Russia (1818-1881), known as the "Tsar Liberator," was Emperor of Russia from 1855 until his assassination in 1881. He implemented the most comprehensive reforms in Russian history since Peter the Great, most notably the emancipation of approximately 23 million serfs in 1861. Despite his sweeping modernization efforts—including judicial, military, and local government reforms—his unwillingness to embrace constitutional monarchy led to growing revolutionary opposition. His reign ended tragically when he was assassinated by members of the revolutionary group Narodnaya Volya (People's Will) on March 13, 1881, ironically on the day he approved plans for limited parliamentary reforms.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Alexander Nikolaevich Romanov was born on April 29, 1818, in Moscow, the eldest son of Emperor Nicholas I and Empress Alexandra Feodorovna (born Princess Charlotte of Prussia). From birth, Alexander was groomed for the throne as heir apparent to the Russian Empire. His childhood took place during an era of rigid autocracy under his father's stern rule, yet his own education would prove remarkably liberal compared to the conservative environment of Nicholas I's court.[^3][^4]

The young grand duke received an exceptionally comprehensive education under the supervision of the renowned liberal poet and literary critic Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky, who had been appointed by Nicholas I to oversee his son's intellectual development. Zhukovsky designed an enlightened curriculum that exposed Alexander to arts, languages, sciences, philosophy, and rigorous military training. The future tsar became fluent in Russian, German, French, English, and Polish, demonstrating considerable intellectual capability. This broad education instilled in him an appreciation for Western European culture and enlightenment ideals that would later influence his reformist policies.[^5][^6]

To complete his education at age 19, Alexander embarked on an extensive tour of Russia and Europe in 1837-1838. During this journey, he became the first Romanov heir to visit Siberia, witnessing firsthand the harsh conditions of Russian provincial life and the backwardness of much of the empire. His European travels brought him into contact with Western political systems and modern governance, experiences that broadened his worldview considerably.[^7] During his visit to the Grand Duchy of Hesse, the young Alexander met 14-year-old Princess Marie of Hesse and fell deeply in love, declaring he would rather abandon the succession than not marry her. They married on April 16, 1841, when Alexander was 23, in what initially appeared to be a loving match.[^8]

Until his accession in 1855 at age 37, few imagined that Alexander would implement such dramatic reforms. His early adult years gave little indication of his ultimate potential as a reformer, and he appeared content to serve in his father's government without challenging the prevailing conservative orthodoxy. However, the catastrophic Crimean War (1853-1856) would prove to be the catalyst that transformed both Russia's fortunes and Alexander's approach to governance.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Alexander II ascended to the Russian throne on March 2, 1855, during one of the most humiliating episodes in Russian history—the Crimean War. His father, Nicholas I, had died (possibly by suicide) as Russian forces suffered devastating defeats against the combined armies of Britain, France, and the Ottoman Empire. The war exposed the profound weaknesses of the Russian state: a backward economy, inadequate infrastructure, military incompetence, and a social system based on serfdom that had left Russia far behind the industrializing nations of Western Europe.[^10][^11]

The new emperor inherited a military disaster. Russian forces, despite their numerical superiority, were being systematically defeated by smaller but technologically superior Western armies. The largely peasant conscripted army was poorly equipped, inadequately trained, and led by an officer corps more concerned with parade-ground precision than battlefield effectiveness. The navy had been decimated, and the empire's finances were in disarray. The Treaty of Paris, signed on March 30, 1856, forced Russia to accept humiliating terms, including the demilitarization of the Black Sea and the loss of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, as well as territorial concessions.[^12][^13]

This catastrophic defeat profoundly influenced Alexander's worldview. The Crimean War demonstrated beyond doubt that Russia's feudal social structure and backward economy could not compete with modern industrial powers. The war's outcome made it painfully clear that fundamental reforms were necessary not merely for humanitarian reasons but for the very survival of the Russian Empire as a great power. As Alexander himself recognized, Russia risked becoming a second-rate nation if it did not modernize rapidly.[^14]

Shortly after the war's conclusion, Alexander delivered his famous speech to the Moscow nobility on March 30, 1856, in which he declared: "The existing condition of owning souls cannot remain unchanged. It is better to begin to destroy serfdom from above than to wait until that time when it begins to destroy itself from below." This statement, which became one of the most famous quotes in Russian history, signaled Alexander's recognition that reform was inevitable and that controlled reform from above was preferable to revolution from below.[^15][^16] The speech marked a decisive break with his father's reactionary policies and set the stage for the most comprehensive reform program in Russian history.

## Major Achievements

### The Emancipation of the Serfs (1861)

Alexander II's most significant and enduring achievement was the Emancipation Manifesto of March 3, 1861 (February 19, Old Style), which freed approximately 23 million serfs—roughly one-third of the Russian Empire's population. This reform has been called "the single most important event in 19th-century Russian history" and represented the beginning of the end for the landed aristocracy's monopoly of power.[^17][^18][^19]

The emancipation was accompanied by 17 legislative acts that freed both serfs on private estates and domestic household serfs. The newly freed serfs gained the full rights of free citizens, including the rights to marry without consent, own property, engage in business, and participate in legal proceedings. The Manifesto also permitted peasants to purchase land from their former landlords through a complex redemption payment system, with the government providing loans to facilitate these transactions.[^20][^21]

However, the emancipation had significant limitations. The terms were often unfavorable to the peasants, who received less land than they had cultivated as serfs and were burdened with redemption payments that would take 49 years to complete. Household serfs benefited the least, gaining their freedom but no land. The land was typically allocated to village communes (mir) rather than individual peasants, which limited personal economic freedom. Most peasants remained poor and land-hungry, crushed by huge redemption payments that were not terminated until the revolutionary year of 1905.[^22][^23]

Despite these limitations, the emancipation fundamentally transformed Russian society. It eliminated the legal foundation of Russia's feudal system, created a mobile labor force necessary for industrialization, and represented a humanitarian milestone. The reform inspired similar emancipation movements and influenced American President Abraham Lincoln's approach to ending slavery in the United States.[^24][^25]

### Judicial Reforms (1864)

The judicial reform of November 20, 1864, is generally considered one of the most successful and consistent of all Alexander II's reforms. The legislation fundamentally transformed Russia's archaic legal system, which had seen little development since the reign of Catherine the Great in the late 18th century.[^26][^27] The reforms introduced sweeping changes that brought Russian jurisprudence closer to Western European standards.

The main reform objective was the simplification of the judicial system, its separation from administrative bodies, providing legal capacity to various strata of society, and strengthening judicial authority including its independence.[^28] Key innovations included the establishment of the principle of equality before the law, the introduction of public hearings, trial by jury, security of tenure for judges, and a professional advocate system that had never existed in Russia. Courts were separated from the executive branch, and judges were appointed for life to ensure their independence.[^29][^30]

The introduction of jury trials represented a particularly revolutionary change. Jury trials included three professional judges and twelve jurors drawn from the community, bringing ordinary citizens into the judicial process for the first time. A new penal code and greatly simplified systems of civil and criminal procedure came into operation. The reforms also created justices of the peace to deal with minor offenses at the local level, making justice more accessible to ordinary Russians.[^31][^32]

### Military Reforms

The disastrous performance of Russian forces in the Crimean War made military reform an urgent priority. Minister of War Dmitry Alekseyevich Milyutin (1861-1881) was responsible for comprehensive military reforms focused on rebuilding the very large but poorly trained army into one that could compete with modern Western armies.[^33][^34]

Milyutin's reforms were revolutionary in scope. He reduced the years of active military service from an oppressive 25 years, first to 15 and then, by the law of 1874, to just 6 years of active service followed by 9 years in the reserves. Universal conscription was introduced for all social classes starting in 1874, ending the nobles' exemption from military service and distributing the burden more equitably.[^35][^36] Military education was dramatically improved for the officer corps, with new military academies established to produce professionally trained officers rather than relying solely on aristocratic birth.

Humanitarian reforms accompanied these structural changes. Corporal punishment in the military and the barbaric practice of branding soldiers as punishment were banned. The building of strategic railways improved military mobility and logistics, addressing one of the critical weaknesses exposed during the Crimean War. These reforms transformed the Russian military into a more effective fighting force, as demonstrated by victories in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878.[^37][^38]

### Local Government Reforms: The Zemstvo System

The law of January 13, 1864, introduced the zemstvo system—district and provincial councils that represented the first experiment with representative government in Russia. Zemstvos were elected local assemblies with authority over education, public health, roads, agriculture, and other local matters. While voting was weighted heavily in favor of landowners, the zemstvos nevertheless brought thousands of educated Russians into public service and created a platform for civic engagement.[^39][^40]

The zemstvos became centers of liberal thought and professionalism, employing doctors, teachers, agronomists, and statisticians. They made significant contributions to rural education, healthcare, and infrastructure development, partially compensating for the central government's neglect of these areas. However, the zemstvos lacked any connection to national governance and had no authority over taxation or police functions, limiting their ultimate impact.[^41]

### Educational Reforms

Alexander II relaxed many of the strict controls on education imposed during his father's reign. Universities gained greater autonomy, censorship of academic publications was reduced, and the curriculum was liberalized. In 1858, he removed most censorship restrictions on the media—newspapers, magazines, books, and pamphlets—resulting in an explosion of new publications and achieving a degree of "glasnost" or open discussion unprecedented in Russian history.[^42][^43]

### Foreign Policy and Territorial Expansion

In foreign affairs, Alexander II achieved significant successes, particularly in territorial expansion. The conquest of Central Asia brought Turkestan, Tashkent, Samarkand, Khiva, and Kokand under Russian control between 1865 and 1876. In 1884, when the Turkmen city of Mary (Merv) surrendered, the whole of Turkestan was included in the Russian realm, significantly expanding Russian territory and influence in Asia.[^44][^45]

The definitive subjugation of the Caucasus occurred in the 1860s, ending decades of resistance, though this conquest involved brutal tactics including mass killings. The acquisition of the Maritime Province from China (1858 and 1860) and the founding of Vladivostok as Russia's far eastern capital (1860) strengthened Russia's position in the Pacific.[^46][^47]

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878 resulted in one of Alexander's greatest triumphs. Russia declared war on April 17, 1877, in support of Orthodox Christian populations in the Balkans suffering under Ottoman rule. The victorious Russian armies forced the Ottoman Sultan to sign the Treaty of San Stefano on February 19, 1878, and the subsequent Congress of Berlin secured the independence of Bulgaria, Montenegro, Romania, and Serbia from Ottoman rule. For his role in liberating Bulgaria, Alexander II became known as the "Tsar-Liberator of Russians and Bulgarians," and a monument to him stands in Sofia to this day.[^48][^49][^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his reformist credentials, Alexander II faced severe criticism from multiple directions and his policies had significant negative consequences. His reign demonstrated the profound contradictions between modernization and autocracy, reform and repression.

### The Reactionary Turn After 1866

Following an assassination attempt by Dmitry Karakozov on April 4, 1866, Alexander II shifted dramatically toward reactionary policies. The attempted assassination terrified the emperor and convinced him that reform had gone too far, unleashing dangerous revolutionary forces. From 1866 onward, Alexander adopted a more repressive style of governance. Censorship was increased, the government reasserted control over education, and attempts to reduce Church corruption and improve treatment of Jews and Poles were abandoned.[^51][^52]

Alexander appointed a series of conservative ministers, including Dmitry Tolstoy as Minister of Education in 1866. Tolstoy, an Orthodox Christian reactionary, wanted to control education to eradicate Western ideas and anti-government criticism. Liberal university courses were replaced by traditional subjects, university censorship increased dramatically, and student organizations were placed under strict control. The progressive educational reforms of the early reign were systematically reversed.[^53][^54]

### The Brutal Suppression of the Polish Uprising (1863-1864)

The January Uprising in Poland (1863-1864) revealed the harsh, repressive side of Alexander's rule. The uprising began on January 22, 1863, triggered when authorities brought forward the conscription of young Polish activists into the Imperial Russian Army for 20-year service. Polish rebels waged a guerrilla war against the regular Russian army, but reprisals were swift and ruthless.[^55][^56]

Public executions and mass deportations to Siberia eventually crushed Polish resistance. After the defeat of the uprising, Alexander II resorted to brutal repression: 128 rebels were publicly executed, and 12,000 were deported to Siberia. Poland, thereafter referred to as the "Vistula lands," had its local governing authorities and education systems shut down and replaced with Russian-led ones. Russia criminalized displays of Polish culture and the Polish language, Catholic churches were shut down, and their land was given to Russians. This systematic Russification policy continued for decades, creating deep and lasting resentment.[^57][^58][^59]

### The Circassian Genocide

The completion of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus during the 1860s involved horrific atrocities against indigenous populations. The Russo-Circassian War (1763-1864) concluded as a Russian victory during Alexander II's rule, but this conquest involved the mass killing and extermination of Circassian "mountaineers" in what historians now recognize as the Circassian genocide. Hundreds of thousands of Circassians were killed or forcibly expelled from their ancestral lands, representing one of the darkest chapters of Alexander's reign.[^60][^61]

### Limitations of the Emancipation

While the emancipation of the serfs was Alexander's greatest achievement, it was also deeply flawed and incomplete. The terms of emancipation left most peasants economically worse off than before. They received less land than they had cultivated as serfs, and the land they did receive was often of poor quality. The redemption payments were crushing financial burdens that kept peasants in poverty for generations. The allocation of land to village communes rather than individuals limited economic freedom and mobility.[^62][^63]

Many liberals criticized Alexander for not going far enough, arguing that true liberation required not just legal freedom but economic opportunity and land ownership. Conservatives, meanwhile, were furious at the erosion of noble privileges and the destruction of the social order they had benefited from. The emancipation satisfied neither group and contributed to growing political instability.[^64]

### Refusal of Constitutional Reform

Perhaps Alexander's greatest failure was his unwillingness to complement his social and administrative reforms with meaningful political liberalization. Despite implementing sweeping changes in nearly every area of Russian life, he adamantly refused to grant a constitution or establish representative government at the national level. He insisted that it was his God-given duty to rule as an autocrat and viewed any limitation on autocratic power as a betrayal of his sacred trust.[^65][^66]

This contradiction between modernization and autocracy proved fatal. By creating a more educated, mobile, and politically aware society while refusing to provide legal channels for political participation, Alexander II inadvertently fueled the revolutionary movements that would ultimately assassinate him. Liberals became increasingly frustrated, radicals grew more desperate, and terrorism emerged as a tool of political change.[^67][^68]

### Sale of Alaska

While strategically defensible given Russia's financial difficulties and the territory's vulnerability to British seizure, the sale of Alaska to the United States for $7.2 million in 1867 has been criticized as a major strategic blunder. Alexander II decided to sell the territory because it would be difficult to defend from the United Kingdom in any future conflict and because Russian interest had waned as the fur trade declined. However, the subsequent discovery of gold and oil in Alaska revealed the magnitude of what Russia had given up.[^69][^70][^71]

## Personal Life

Alexander II's personal life was marked by both conventional imperial duty and scandalous romantic passion, revealing a complex man torn between public responsibility and private desire.

### Marriage to Marie of Hesse

Alexander's marriage to Princess Marie of Hesse (later Empress Maria Alexandrovna) began as a love match. He had met her when she was just 14 during his European tour and was so smitten that he declared he would rather abandon the succession than not marry her. They married on April 16, 1841, and initially made a happy couple, full of tender care for one another. Alexander was an attentive husband in the early years, ordering banquets of fresh strawberries for his wife's table and enjoying spending mornings sitting on her bed talking.[^72][^73]

The couple had eight children together: Alexandra (1842-1849), Nicholas (1843-1865, the heir apparent who died of meningitis), Alexander (the future Alexander III), Vladimir, Alexei, Sergei, Paul, and Maria. However, the relationship deteriorated over the years. Marie suffered from tuberculosis, which progressively weakened her health and made her an invalid. The emotional and physical distance between the imperial couple grew, and Alexander sought affection elsewhere.[^74][^75]

### The Scandalous Affair with Catherine Dolgorukova

In 1865, the 47-year-old emperor fell passionately in love with 18-year-old Princess Ekaterina Mikhailovna Dolgorukova, beginning an affair that would scandalize Russian society and complicate the succession. Catherine was a student at the Smolny Institute, a finishing school for noble girls, when Alexander became infatuated with her. Their relationship quickly became intimate, and Catherine became his long-term mistress, bearing him four children while Empress Marie was still alive.[^76][^77][^78]

The affair was conducted with shocking openness by imperial standards. Alexander installed Catherine in apartments in the Winter Palace, where she lived with their illegitimate children while the dying empress resided in other rooms of the same building. This arrangement deeply humiliated Marie and scandalized both the imperial family and court society. In an extraordinarily gracious gesture, the dying Empress Maria Alexandrovna asked to meet her husband's children with Catherine, and Alexander brought their two older children, George and Olga, to her deathbed, where she kissed and blessed them.[^79][^80]

When Marie died of tuberculosis on June 3, 1880, Alexander waited only 40 days before marrying Catherine in a secret morganatic ceremony at Tsarskoye Selo on July 18, 1880. He granted her the title Princess Yurievskaya and openly proclaimed his intention to crown her empress. This hasty remarriage shocked the imperial family and was seen as indecent and disrespectful to the late empress's memory. The marriage created a succession crisis, as Alexander's children with Catherine were now legitimate and might claim rights to the throne, threatening the position of his son Alexander Alexandrovich (the future Alexander III).[^81][^82]

### Personality and Character

Alexander II was described as a complex personality—intellectually capable but not brilliant, well-intentioned but often indecisive, reformist in instinct but authoritarian by conviction. He possessed genuine humanitarian impulses and was sincerely disturbed by the suffering of his subjects, yet he could also be ruthlessly repressive when he felt his authority threatened. His liberal education under Zhukovsky had instilled progressive ideals, but his upbringing as heir to an autocracy convinced him of the sacred nature of unlimited imperial power.[^83][^84]

Those who knew him described a man who could be charming and personable in private settings but who grew increasingly isolated and fearful as assassination attempts multiplied. By the final years of his reign, he lived in constant fear of revolutionary terrorists, moving between heavily guarded palaces and limiting his public appearances. The psychological toll of multiple assassination attempts and the burden of ruling an empire in turmoil wore heavily on him.[^85]

---

## Legacy

Alexander II's legacy remains deeply contested, embodying the contradictions of Russian modernization in the 19th century. He was simultaneously a great reformer and an autocrat, a liberator and a repressor, a modernizer and a conservative.

### The Tsar Liberator

In Russia and Bulgaria, Alexander II earned the honorific title "Tsar Liberator" for emancipating millions from bondage. The emancipation of the serfs represented a humanitarian milestone comparable to the abolition of slavery in the Americas. His judicial, military, and administrative reforms modernized Russian institutions and brought them closer to Western European standards. For these achievements, he deserves recognition as one of the most consequential Russian rulers, implementing reforms that Peter the Great and Catherine the Great had not dared attempt.[^86][^87]

In Bulgaria, where he is remembered as the "Tsar-Liberator of Russians and Bulgarians," his intervention in the Russo-Turkish War enabled the creation of an independent Bulgarian state after five centuries of Ottoman rule. The Monument to the Tsar Liberator in central Sofia commemorates his decisive role in Bulgarian liberation, and he remains a revered figure in Bulgarian historical memory.[^88][^89]

### The Reformer Who Failed

Yet Alexander's ultimate legacy is one of failure and tragedy. His reforms, comprehensive as they were, did not create a stable, modernized Russia. Instead, by modernizing society while refusing political liberalization, he created the conditions for revolution. His unwillingness to grant a constitution or representative government meant that an increasingly educated and politically aware society had no legal means to participate in governance or influence policy.[^90][^91]

The revolutionary movements that assassinated him were, in a profound sense, products of his own policies. By raising expectations through reform but refusing to fulfill them through political change, he created frustration and radicalization. By relaxing censorship and expanding education, he enabled the spread of radical ideas. By freeing the serfs but leaving them impoverished, he created a vast population of discontented individuals with nothing to lose.[^92]

### Historical Assessment and Paradox

Historians have noted the fundamental paradox of Alexander II's reign: "It can be said that he was a great historical figure without being a great man, that what he did was more important than what he was." His Great Reforms rank in importance with those of Peter the Great and would later influence Lenin's transformation of Russia, yet 20 years after beginning his reforms, he was murdered by terrorists, highlighting that significant though his reforms were, they failed to create popular support for the Tsarist regime.[^93][^94]

Alexander II demonstrated that autocratic reform, however well-intentioned, cannot substitute for political liberalization. His tragedy was that he understood Russia needed modernization but could not accept that modernization ultimately requires democracy. He could reform everything except the one thing that mattered most—the autocratic system itself. This fundamental contradiction ensured that his reforms would ultimately fail to save the Romanov dynasty or prevent the revolutions that would come.[^95]

### The Irony of His Death

The supreme irony of Alexander II's assassination is that he died on the very day he signed the Loris-Melikov Constitution, a proclamation that would have created two legislative commissions made up of indirectly elected representatives—a tentative first step toward constitutional government. Had he survived to implement these reforms, Russian history might have taken a different path. Instead, his assassination ensured that his son Alexander III would reject all further reform and return to reactionary autocracy, making revolution almost inevitable.[^96][^97]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and sympathetic historians emphasize Alexander II's courage in implementing reforms that challenged entrenched aristocratic interests and transformed Russian society. W. E. Mosse, a prominent historian of Russian reform, argued that Alexander's emancipation of the serfs was "the single most important event in 19th-century Russian history" and represented a genuine humanitarian achievement that improved the lives of millions.[^98]

Defenders point out that Alexander faced immense opposition from conservative nobles who saw reform as a betrayal of their class interests. Despite this opposition and the risk to his own position, he persevered with reforms that he believed necessary for Russia's survival as a great power. The judicial reforms, in particular, are praised as genuinely progressive and largely successful, creating a more just and equitable legal system that functioned relatively well until the Bolshevik Revolution.[^99][^100]

Historians recognize that Alexander's reforms laid the groundwork for Russia's industrial revolution in the late 19th century. By creating a mobile labor force through serf emancipation, modernizing the legal system, improving education, and encouraging economic development, he enabled the rapid industrialization that would transform Russia into a major industrial power by 1914. Without these reforms, Russia's economic modernization would have been impossible.[^101]

Some scholars argue that Alexander II should be understood in the context of his time rather than judged by modern democratic standards. For a 19th-century autocrat, his reforms were remarkably progressive and demonstrated genuine commitment to improving his subjects' welfare. The comparison with other contemporary monarchs—who generally resisted all reform—shows Alexander in a relatively favorable light as a pragmatic modernizer willing to sacrifice aristocratic privilege for national strength.[^102]

In Bulgaria and other Balkan nations, Alexander II is remembered as a liberator who freed millions from Ottoman oppression. His decision to intervene in the Balkans was motivated partly by humanitarian concern for Orthodox Christians suffering under Turkish rule, and the gratitude of these nations remains a significant part of his positive legacy.[^103]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Alexander II was never truly a liberal reformer but rather a pragmatic autocrat who reformed only to preserve the autocratic system. Historian Richard Pipes contends that Alexander's reforms "were a direct response to Russia's defeat in the Crimean War and were intended to liberate Russian society from some of its most archaic practices, improve economic and military efficiency, and preserve the existing socio-political structure by a process of modification"—not to transform Russia into a free society.[^104][^105]

Many historians criticize the characterization of Alexander as "Tsar Liberator," pointing to his reactionary and traditionalist ideas as evidence that he entered into reform because of fear, not philanthropy. His famous statement about abolishing serfdom "from above" before it abolished itself "from below" reveals that he was motivated primarily by the desire to prevent revolution, not by humanitarian principles.[^106][^107]

The brutal suppression of the Polish uprising and the Circassian genocide demonstrate that Alexander could be as ruthlessly repressive as his reactionary father when imperial interests required it. Critics argue that his willingness to use mass violence against subject peoples contradicts any claim to being a humanitarian reformer. The systematic Russification policies in Poland, the destruction of Polish culture and institutions, and the ethnic cleansing in the Caucasus reveal the limits of his liberalism.[^108][^109]

Radical critics, particularly those in the revolutionary tradition, condemned Alexander for not going nearly far enough in his reforms. They argued that the emancipation was a cruel deception that freed serfs in name only while leaving them economically enslaved through redemption payments and land hunger. The refusal to grant political freedom or a constitution meant that all other reforms were ultimately meaningless, as Russians remained subjects rather than citizens.[^110][^111]

Many scholars emphasize that Alexander's shift toward reaction after 1866 revealed his true character. When faced with growing demands for political participation, he responded with increased censorship, educational control, and repression. This reactionary turn undermined many of his earlier reforms and demonstrated that his commitment to liberalization was shallow and conditional. His willingness to abandon reform when it threatened autocratic power showed that preserving autocracy, not improving society, was his true priority.[^112][^113]

Historians critical of Alexander point out that by refusing political reform while modernizing society, he created the conditions for revolutionary terrorism and ultimately ensured the violent destruction of the Romanov dynasty. His half-measures satisfied no one: they enraged conservatives without appeasing liberals, raised expectations without fulfilling them, and created educated, mobile masses with no stake in the existing order. In this view, Alexander II bears significant responsibility for the revolutions that would destroy tsarism.[^114][^115]
