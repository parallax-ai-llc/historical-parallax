## Overview

The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 (October 23 - November 10) was a spontaneous nationwide uprising against the Soviet-imposed communist government of Hungary. What began as a student demonstration became a revolution demanding democracy, free elections, and withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact. For a brief, euphoric period, Hungarians seemed to have won. Then Soviet tanks returned, crushing the revolution in days. Approximately 2,500 Hungarians died, 200,000 fled as refugees, and the world witnessed the brutal reality of Cold War spheres of influence.

## Background

### Soviet Control of Hungary

**Post-WWII:**
Hungary, occupied by Red Army since 1945, became communist state under Stalin's direction.

**Mátyás Rákosi:**
Stalinist dictator (1948-1956). Reign of terror:
- Secret police (ÁVH)
- Show trials, purges
- Economic mismanagement
- Political repression
- Collectivization

**1953 Changes:**
After Stalin's death, Imre Nagy briefly led reform government, relaxing repression. Removed 1955; Rákosi returned.

### 1956 Ferment

**Khrushchev's "Secret Speech" (February 1956):**
Soviet leader denounced Stalin's crimes. Encouraged reform hopes.

**Polish October (October 1956):**
Poland resisted Soviet interference; won limited autonomy. Hungarians inspired.

## The Revolution

### October 23: It Begins

**Student Demonstration:**
Students marched to Polish embassy in solidarity with Poland. Crowd grew to 200,000.

**Demands:**
- Free elections
- Free press
- Withdrawal of Soviet troops
- Return of Imre Nagy
- Removal of Stalin statue

**Stalin Statue Toppled:**
Massive statue pulled down at City Park—iconic image.

**Radio Budapest:**
Crowd gathered demanding broadcast of demands. ÁVH (secret police) fired on crowd.

**Revolution Born:**
Gunfire transformed protest into armed uprising.

### Spontaneous Uprising

**Armed Resistance:**
- Workers joined
- Soldiers defected; gave weapons
- Street fighting across Budapest
- Revolutionary councils formed

**Soviet Intervention (October 24):**
Initial Soviet forces already in Hungary intervened. Ineffective; tanks unsuited for street fighting.

### Imre Nagy Returns

**October 24:**
Nagy appointed Prime Minister by party to calm situation.

**Evolving Position:**
Initially called for order; increasingly embraced revolutionary demands.

### Ceasefire and Hope (October 28-November 1)

**October 28:**
Nagy announced ceasefire; Soviets began withdrawing.

**October 30:**
One-party system abolished; multiparty democracy announced.

**November 1:**
Nagy announced Hungary's withdrawal from Warsaw Pact, declared neutrality.

**Brief Freedom:**
For days, Hungary seemed free. Political prisoners released. Free press. Euphoria.

## Soviet Invasion

### Decision to Crush

**Khrushchev's Calculation:**
- Couldn't allow Warsaw Pact defection
- Suez Crisis distracted West
- Hungary as example would spread

**Operation Whirlwind:**
200,000 Soviet troops, 2,500 tanks mobilized.

### November 4: The Attack

**Dawn Attack:**
Soviet forces entered Budapest and other cities.

**Nagy's Final Broadcast (5:20 AM):**
> "This is Imre Nagy speaking. Today at daybreak Soviet forces started an attack against our capital, obviously with the intention of overthrowing the legal Hungarian democratic government. Our troops are fighting. The government is in its place. I notify the people of our country and the entire world of this fact."

**Street Fighting:**
Hungarians resisted with small arms, Molotov cocktails. Hopelessly outgunned.

### End of Resistance (November 10)

Last pockets of resistance crushed. Revolution over.

## Aftermath

### Human Cost

- ~2,500 Hungarians killed
- ~700 Soviet soldiers killed
- 20,000+ Hungarians wounded
- 200,000 fled as refugees (mostly to Austria)

### Repression

**János Kádár:**
Installed as new leader by Soviets. Initial repression; later, "Goulash Communism"—more relaxed.

**Imre Nagy:**
Took refuge in Yugoslav embassy. Promised safe passage; kidnapped by Soviets. Secret trial. Executed June 16, 1958.

**Purges:**
- 22,000 prosecuted
- 350 executed
- Thousands imprisoned

### Western Response

**None:**
Despite Radio Free Europe's apparent encouragement, West did nothing.

**Suez Crisis:**
Britain, France, Israel invading Egypt simultaneously—West divided, distracted.

**Cold War Reality:**
Hungary in Soviet sphere. Western intervention would mean World War III.

## International Impact

### Disillusionment

**Western Communists:**
Many left Communist parties after seeing Soviet brutality.

**Cold War Lesson:**
Spheres of influence were real. USSR would use force to maintain control.

### Refugees

**200,000 Fled:**
Largest European refugee crisis since WWII. Many resettled in West—U.S., Canada, Austria.
