## Overview

Pablo Escobar was the wealthiest criminal in history and the leader of the Medellín Cartel. At the height of his power in the 1980s, he supplied 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States, earning an estimated $420 million a week. He was a paradox: a ruthless protected terrorist who bombed airliners and assassinated politicians, yet also a "Robin Hood" figure who built housing for the poor in Medellín. His war against the Colombian state ("Plata o Plomo"—Silver or Lead) cost thousands of lives. His reign ended on a rooftop in Medellín in 1993, when he was shot dead by Colombian police special forces.
