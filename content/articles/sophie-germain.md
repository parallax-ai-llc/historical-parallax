## Summary

Sophie Germain was a French mathematician and physicist who made significant contributions to number theory and elasticity theory despite facing severe gender discrimination. She proved a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem for a class of prime numbers now called Sophie Germain primes. Her work on the vibration of elastic surfaces won a prize from the French Academy of Sciences. She studied mathematics secretly, corresponding with Gauss under a male pseudonym.
