## Summary

Sir John Bowring (1792-1872) was a British diplomat, writer, and linguist who served as the fourth Governor of Hong Kong from 1854 to 1859. A controversial figure in Asian colonial history, he is best known for initiating the Second Opium War through his aggressive response to the Arrow Incident of 1856. A polyglot who claimed knowledge of over 200 languages and fluency in 100, Bowring was also a prolific writer, political economist, and advocate for free trade who edited the Westminster Review and served as Member of Parliament. His governorship of Hong Kong marked a turning point in British-Chinese relations, leading to devastating military conflict and the expansion of British colonial power in Asia.

## Early Life and Background

John Bowring was born on October 17, 1792, in Exeter, Devon, England, to a family of modest means involved in the wool trade. His father, Charles Bowring, was a wool merchant and manufacturer who provided young John with a practical education focused on commerce and languages. Despite limited formal schooling, Bowring demonstrated extraordinary linguistic aptitude from an early age, teaching himself numerous European languages while working in his father's business.[^1]

Growing up during the Napoleonic Wars, Bowring witnessed the economic disruptions of continental blockades and developed an early interest in political economy and international trade. His childhood in Exeter, a prosperous mercantile city, exposed him to the practical realities of commerce and the importance of foreign markets. The family's Unitarian faith also shaped his intellectual development, as Unitarians of the period emphasized rational inquiry, social reform, and religious tolerance.[^2]

As a young man, Bowring joined his father's wool business and traveled extensively throughout Europe, using these journeys to master additional languages and establish commercial contacts. His linguistic gifts were remarkable—he eventually claimed knowledge of 200 languages and dialects, with fluency in approximately 100, though scholars have debated the extent of his actual proficiency. These travels during the post-Napoleonic period allowed him to observe the economic recovery of Europe and reinforced his belief in the benefits of free trade and international cooperation.[^3]

Bowring's self-education extended beyond languages to encompass literature, philosophy, and political economy. He became an avid reader of Jeremy Bentham's utilitarian philosophy and the works of Adam Smith, which would profoundly influence his later career as an advocate for commercial liberalization. His early life thus combined practical commercial experience with intense intellectual curiosity, preparing him for his multifaceted career as diplomat, writer, and politician.[^4]

## Rise to Power

Bowring's ascent to prominence began in the 1820s when he established himself in London's intellectual and reform circles. His breakthrough came in 1820 when he met the elderly philosopher Jeremy Bentham, becoming his devoted disciple and eventual literary executor. This connection opened doors to the radical reform movement and led to his appointment as editor of the Westminster Review in 1824, a influential journal promoting Benthamite utilitarianism and political reform.[^5]

Through the Westminster Review, Bowring championed causes including parliamentary reform, free trade, religious liberty, and the abolition of colonial monopolies. He used his linguistic skills to introduce English readers to European literature, publishing translations of Russian, Polish, Hungarian, and Spanish poetry that earned him literary recognition. His 1821 anthology of Russian poetry was among the first substantial introductions of Russian literature to English audiences.[^6]

Bowring's expertise in languages and international commerce led to government appointments as a commercial envoy. In 1831, he was sent on a mission to Belgium and France to report on commercial conditions, followed by similar assignments to Egypt and Syria in 1837-1838. These missions established his reputation as an expert on international trade and diplomatic relations. His reports, which combined economic analysis with cultural observations, were widely read and influenced British commercial policy.[^7]

In 1835, Bowring entered Parliament as the Liberal Member for Kilmarnock Burghs, though he lost his seat in 1837. He returned to the Commons in 1841 as MP for Bolton, where he became a vocal advocate for free trade and the repeal of the Corn Laws. His parliamentary career, though not particularly distinguished, kept him in the public eye and demonstrated his commitment to economic liberalism.[^8]

The culmination of Bowring's rise came in 1849 when he was appointed British Consul at Canton (Guangzhou) and later Superintendent of Trade in China. In 1854, he was promoted to Governor of Hong Kong and Chief Superintendent of Trade, positions that gave him enormous authority over British relations with China. This appointment reflected both his diplomatic experience and the British government's confidence in his ability to expand commercial opportunities in Asia, though it would lead to his most controversial actions.[^9]

## Major Achievements

Bowring's most significant achievement was his role in expanding British influence in China, culminating in the Second Opium War (1856-1860), though the war itself remains deeply controversial. Following the Arrow Incident in October 1856, when Chinese officials boarded the lorcha Arrow and arrested its Chinese crew for suspected piracy, Bowring demanded an apology and reparations from Chinese authorities. When his demands were refused, he ordered the Royal Navy to bombard Canton, initiating a conflict that would eventually involve France and result in the Treaty of Tientsin (1858) and the Convention of Peking (1860), which opened additional Chinese ports to foreign trade, legalized the opium trade, and expanded Western diplomatic presence in Beijing.[^10]

As Governor of Hong Kong (1854-1859), Bowring oversaw significant development of the colony's infrastructure and administrative systems. He promoted the construction of roads, improved harbor facilities, and advocated for the establishment of a police force and judiciary based on British models. Under his governorship, Hong Kong's population grew substantially, and the colony became increasingly important as a commercial entrepôt between China and the West.[^11]

Bowring's literary and linguistic achievements were considerable and long-lasting. His translations introduced English-speaking audiences to the literatures of numerous nations, including his pioneering "Specimens of the Russian Poets" (1821-1823), translations of Hungarian, Polish, Czech, and Serbian poetry, and his collection "The Decimal System in Numbers, Coins and Accounts" (1854). He also wrote hymns that remain in use today, most notably "In the Cross of Christ I Glory," which has been included in numerous hymnals and translated into many languages.[^12]

As a political economist and advocate for free trade, Bowring made substantial contributions to the liberalization of British commercial policy. His numerous reports from diplomatic missions provided Parliament with detailed information about foreign markets and trade barriers, contributing to the intellectual foundation for the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and the broader movement toward free trade that characterized mid-Victorian economic policy.[^13]

Bowring's work as editor of the Westminster Review (1824-1836) helped establish utilitarian philosophy as a major force in British intellectual life. He published articles on political reform, legal codification, and social improvement that influenced the reform movements of the 1830s and 1840s. His editorship made the Review a significant platform for radical ideas during a crucial period of British political development.[^14]

His diplomatic missions produced valuable documentation of societies in transition. His accounts of Egypt and Syria in the 1830s, based on his 1837-1838 mission, provided detailed observations of Ottoman administration and society during a period of significant change under Muhammad Ali Pasha. These reports combined economic data with cultural and political analysis, contributing to Western understanding of the Middle East.[^15]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The Arrow Incident and the subsequent Second Opium War remain Bowring's most controversial legacy. Critics in Britain and internationally condemned his decision to initiate military action without explicit government authorization, arguing that he exceeded his authority and unnecessarily provoked a destructive war. The Arrow was later revealed to have dubious claim to British registration, as its certificate had expired, undermining the legal basis for Bowring's actions. The bombardment of Canton killed thousands of Chinese civilians and destroyed significant portions of the city.[^16]

Parliamentary debates in Britain revealed sharp divisions over Bowring's conduct. In 1857, the House of Commons passed a vote of censure against Prime Minister Palmerston's government for supporting Bowring's actions, though Palmerston subsequently won a general election fought partly on the China question. Critics, including William Gladstone, Richard Cobden, and John Bright, denounced the war as unjust and argued that Bowring had acted recklessly in pursuit of commercial expansion. The Manchester School of free traders particularly condemned the use of military force to open markets.[^17]

Bowring's role in promoting the opium trade has attracted severe criticism from modern historians and was controversial even in his own time. As Governor of Hong Kong, he actively defended the opium trade as a legitimate commercial enterprise and resisted Chinese attempts to suppress it, despite growing recognition of opium's devastating social effects in China. His position exemplified the moral contradictions of Victorian imperialism, where free trade principles were invoked to justify the forced distribution of addictive drugs.[^18]

During his governorship, Bowring faced accusations of administrative incompetence and corruption. Critics charged that he was more interested in pursuing grand diplomatic schemes than in effectively governing Hong Kong. Complaints about inadequate public services, poor urban planning, and favoritism in government contracts plagued his administration. Some contemporaries viewed him as vain and overly ambitious, willing to risk war to enhance his own reputation.[^19]

Bowring's claims about his linguistic abilities were questioned by contemporaries and later scholars. While he undoubtedly had significant talent for languages, skeptics argued that his assertions of knowing 200 languages and being fluent in 100 were exaggerations. Some critics suggested that his knowledge of many languages was superficial, based on limited vocabulary and basic grammatical structures rather than true fluency. This criticism pointed to a broader pattern of self-promotion and embellishment in Bowring's public persona.[^20]

His political career was marked by inconsistencies that troubled both supporters and opponents. Despite his professed commitment to peace and free trade, his actions in China involved military coercion and the expansion of colonial control. His Unitarian faith emphasized moral responsibility, yet his defense of the opium trade and his willingness to bombard civilian populations seemed to contradict these principles. Critics saw him as an opportunist who adapted his principles to suit his ambitions.[^21]

## Personal Life

John Bowring married Maria Lewin in 1816, and the couple had eight children together. Maria was a devoted partner who supported his extensive travels and literary pursuits, though she spent much of her life managing the household while Bowring pursued his diplomatic and political career. The marriage appears to have been stable and affectionate, though Bowring's frequent absences on diplomatic missions meant long periods of separation.[^22]

Bowring's Unitarianism profoundly shaped his personal values and worldview. He was an active member of the Unitarian community throughout his life, writing hymns and religious poetry that reflected his liberal Protestant theology. His faith emphasized rational inquiry, moral duty, and social responsibility, though critics noted the tension between these values and his support for the opium trade and military aggression in China.[^23]

Personally, Bowring was described by contemporaries as energetic, ambitious, and gregarious, with a talent for cultivating useful connections. He was known for his conversational abilities and his practice of entertaining guests with demonstrations of his linguistic knowledge. However, some found him vain and self-promoting, given to exaggerating his accomplishments and linguistic abilities. His voluminous correspondence reveals a man deeply engaged with the intellectual and political debates of his era.[^24]

Bowring maintained friendships with numerous prominent figures of his time, including Jeremy Bentham, who made him his literary executor, and various European literary and political figures he met during his travels. His role as Bentham's disciple and the editor of his unpublished works became an important part of his identity, though some critics suggested he was not always faithful to Bentham's intentions in editing and publishing the philosopher's manuscripts.[^25]

In his later years, after returning from Hong Kong in 1859, Bowring lived in Exeter and continued writing and publishing. He produced an autobiography, "Autobiographical Recollections" (1877, published posthumously), which provided his own account of his controversial career. He remained active in literary and Unitarian circles until his death on November 23, 1872, at the age of 80, in Exeter, the city of his birth.[^26]

## Legacy

John Bowring's legacy is deeply contested, embodying the contradictions of Victorian imperialism. In Hong Kong and China, he is remembered primarily as the architect of the Second Opium War, a conflict that caused immense suffering and humiliation. Chinese historians view him as a symbol of Western aggression and the "unequal treaties" that characterized the "century of humiliation." The war he initiated led to the deaths of thousands, the destruction of the Old Summer Palace in Beijing, and the forced opening of China to Western commercial and political penetration.[^27]

In British imperial history, Bowring represents both the expansionist ambitions of the Victorian era and the moral ambiguities of empire. Defenders argue that he was acting to protect British commercial interests and uphold the prestige of the Empire in the face of Chinese resistance to free trade. Critics view him as an example of how economic liberalism could be used to justify military aggression and the imposition of harmful trade in opium. His career illustrates the complex relationship between free trade ideology and imperial expansion.[^28]

Bowring's literary legacy has proven more enduring and less controversial than his political career. His translations introduced English readers to the literatures of numerous European nations and helped broaden Victorian cultural horizons. His hymn "In the Cross of Christ I Glory" remains widely sung in Christian churches across the world, arguably his most lasting positive contribution. His work as a translator and literary mediator between cultures represents a cosmopolitan vision that contrasts sharply with his role in colonial expansion.[^29]

In the history of linguistics and language study, Bowring is remembered as an extraordinary polyglot, though with qualifications regarding the extent of his actual knowledge. His linguistic abilities, even if exaggerated, were remarkable for his era and reflected the Victorian fascination with language learning and comparative philology. His example inspired others to pursue linguistic studies, though modern standards of linguistic proficiency would likely evaluate his claims more skeptically.[^30]

The institutions and treaties resulting from Bowring's actions had lasting consequences. The Treaty of Tientsin and the Convention of Peking reshaped British-Chinese relations for decades, establishing the framework for foreign concessions and extraterritoriality that would persist until the mid-20th century. Hong Kong itself, which he governed during a crucial period of development, remained a British colony until 1997, with its character as an international commercial center partially stemming from the policies and conflicts of Bowring's era.[^31]

In contemporary discussions of colonialism and its legacies, Bowring serves as a case study in how individuals motivated by liberal economic principles could nonetheless engage in oppressive and destructive imperial practices. His career challenges simplistic narratives about colonialism, revealing how free trade advocates could support military intervention and how cosmopolitan intellectuals could defend exploitative commercial practices. This complexity makes him a valuable subject for understanding the contradictions of 19th-century liberalism.[^32]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Bowring have emphasized his genuine commitment to free trade and his belief that commercial exchange would benefit both Britain and China. Some historians argue that he was operating within the accepted norms of his era, when colonial expansion and the assertion of European commercial rights were widely supported across the political spectrum. In this view, Bowring was implementing British policy rather than acting solely from personal ambition.[^33]

Bowring's contributions to literature and cultural exchange have been praised by scholars of comparative literature and translation studies. His translations made non-English European poetry accessible to British readers at a time when such cultural exchange was rare. His anthologies of Russian, Hungarian, Polish, and other Slavic poetries were pioneering works that expanded the Victorian literary imagination and fostered appreciation for European cultural diversity.[^34]

Admirers of Bowring's linguistic achievements point to his extraordinary dedication to language learning and his role in popularizing the study of non-Western languages in Britain. While the precise extent of his knowledge remains debated, his linguistic work represented an impressive intellectual accomplishment and demonstrated the Victorian belief in the power of education and self-improvement. His linguistic talents were recognized through his election to numerous learned societies across Europe.[^35]

Some historians have argued that Bowring's administration of Hong Kong, despite its flaws, contributed to the colony's development into a successful commercial center. His promotion of infrastructure development and legal institutions, based on British models, helped establish the administrative framework that would support Hong Kong's growth. In this interpretation, his governorship had positive long-term consequences despite the controversies of the Arrow Incident.[^36]

Bowring's advocacy for religious tolerance and his Unitarian faith have been praised as reflecting progressive values for his era. His support for the removal of disabilities affecting religious dissenters and his opposition to established church privileges aligned with broader movements for religious liberty. His hymn writing and religious poetry demonstrated a sincere faith that motivated his social reform activities.[^37]

Supporters also note his role in the movement for free trade, which they view as economically beneficial and morally superior to protectionism. Bowring's reports from his diplomatic missions provided valuable information that helped inform the repeal of the Corn Laws and other trade restrictions. His work contributed to the economic liberalization that characterized mid-Victorian Britain and promoted greater international economic integration.[^38]

### Negative Views

Critics of Bowring condemn his role in initiating the Second Opium War as an unjustifiable act of aggression that caused enormous suffering. Modern historians emphasize that the Arrow Incident was a flimsy pretext for a war aimed at forcing China to accept British commercial demands, including the legalization of opium imports. The bombardment of Canton and the subsequent war resulted in thousands of deaths and the destruction of irreplaceable cultural treasures, including the Old Summer Palace.[^39]

The moral contradiction between Bowring's professed liberal and Christian values and his defense of the opium trade has attracted severe criticism. Historians note that by the 1850s, the devastating effects of opium addiction in China were well documented, and many in Britain opposed the trade on moral grounds. Bowring's willingness to use military force to protect and expand this trade represents, in this view, a profound moral failure and an example of how economic interests could override ethical considerations in the imperial system.[^40]

Scholars critical of imperialism view Bowring as exemplifying the violence inherent in colonial expansion, even when justified through liberal rhetoric about free trade. His career demonstrates how the ideology of commercial liberalism could serve as a cover for military aggression and the imposition of unequal treaties. The "free trade" he promoted was achieved through gunboat diplomacy, undermining claims that commercial expansion was peaceful or mutually beneficial.[^41]

Critics have questioned Bowring's administrative competence, pointing to complaints about his governance of Hong Kong and his tendency to prioritize diplomatic schemes over effective administration. His decision to bombard Canton without clear authorization from London has been cited as evidence of recklessness and poor judgment. The parliamentary censure of his actions suggests that even many contemporaries viewed his conduct as inappropriate and dangerous.[^42]

Some historians have criticized Bowring's self-promotion and exaggeration of his accomplishments, particularly regarding his linguistic abilities. The gap between his claims and his demonstrable knowledge in many languages suggests a pattern of embellishment that raises questions about his reliability as a source. This tendency to self-aggrandizement, critics argue, reveals character flaws that affected his decision-making in positions of authority.[^43]

Modern assessments of Bowring's legacy often emphasize the lasting damage caused by the Second Opium War and the treaty system it expanded. The war deepened Chinese resentment of Western imperialism, contributed to internal instability that led to devastating conflicts like the Taiping Rebellion, and established patterns of foreign domination that China would struggle to overcome for a century. In this view, Bowring's actions had catastrophic long-term consequences that far outweigh his cultural and literary contributions.[^44]
