## Summary

Milarepa is the most beloved figure in Tibetan Buddhism, a poet-saint whose life story of crime, repentance, and enlightenment has inspired generations. After killing 35 people through black magic, he sought redemption through his teacher Marpa. He spent years meditating in caves and is said to have achieved full enlightenment in one lifetime. His songs of realization (dohas) are among the most beautiful in Tibetan literature.
