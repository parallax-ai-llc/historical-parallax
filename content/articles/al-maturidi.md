Al-Maturidi was an Islamic theologian and Quran exegete who founded the Maturidi school of theology, the second major orthodox school of Sunni theology alongside Ash'arism. He emphasized the role of reason in understanding faith and developed a systematic theology that balanced revelation and rational inquiry. His major work Kitab al-Tawhid is a foundational text of Islamic theology. The Maturidi school became predominant among Hanafi Muslims.
