## Summary

Yu Gwan-sun (유관순; 柳寬順; December 16, 1902 – September 28, 1920) was a Korean independence activist who became one of the most iconic figures of the March First Movement against Japanese colonial rule.[^1] At just 16 years old, she organized a massive demonstration in her hometown of Cheonan that drew approximately 3,000 participants, during which Japanese military police killed her parents.[^2] Imprisoned at Seodaemun Prison, she endured brutal torture and continued her resistance until her death at age 17, earning her the title of "Korea's Joan of Arc."[^3] Her sacrifice became a powerful symbol of Korean resistance and the struggle for national sovereignty.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Yu Gwan-sun was born on December 16, 1902, in Jiryeong-ri (now Yongdu-ri), near Cheonan in South Chungcheong Province of the Korean Empire.[^5] She was the second daughter among five children born to Yu Jungkwon and Lee Soje, in a family of three sons and two daughters.[^6] Her family was deeply rooted in Protestant Christianity, influenced by her grandfather Yu Yoon-gi and her uncle Yu Joong-moo, who were among the early Korean converts to Protestantism.[^7] Her father diligently taught her Christian principles, giving her a strong religious foundation that would later inform her sense of justice and moral courage.[^8]

From an early age, Yu demonstrated exceptional intelligence and a remarkable memory. She was considered a gifted child who could memorize Bible passages after hearing them only once.[^9] She attended the nearby Maebong Presbyterian Church, where her talents caught the attention of American missionary Alice J. Hammond Sharp.[^10] Recognizing the young girl's potential, Sharp encouraged her to pursue education at the Hakdang Mission School for Girls in Seoul, approximately 90 kilometers from her home.[^11]

In an era when education for women was extremely rare in Korea, Yu's enrollment at Ewha Haktang (the forerunner of Ewha Womans University) represented a significant opportunity.[^12] Founded in 1886 by Methodist missionary Mary F. Scranton and named by King Gojong, Ewha was Korea's first private educational institution for women.[^13] Yu attended through a scholarship program that required recipients to work as teachers after graduation, combining educational opportunity with future service obligations.[^14] The curriculum included the Bible as the most important subject, along with English, mathematics, Korean (Hangul), music, history, writing, and Chinese characters.[^15]

Nine members of the Yu family spanning three generations would ultimately become involved in Korea's independence movement, demonstrating the family's deep commitment to national sovereignty.[^16] This familial dedication to resistance against Japanese occupation would profoundly shape Yu's own trajectory as an activist and martyr.

## Rise to Prominence

Yu Gwan-sun's transformation from student to revolutionary leader occurred during the tumultuous spring of 1919, when Korea erupted in nationwide protests against Japanese colonial rule. Korea had become Japan's protectorate in 1905 and was officially annexed in 1910, subjecting Koreans to nearly a decade of severe suppression under brutal military colonial regime.[^17] The Japanese occupation brought harsh policies including land seizures, forced industrialization benefiting Japanese interests, and cultural suppression aimed at eradicating Korean language and identity.[^18]

The March First Movement was inspired by multiple factors: the Russian Revolution of 1917, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points emphasizing national self-determination presented at the Paris Peace Conference on January 8, 1919, and the unexpected death of Emperor Gojong on January 22, 1919.[^19] On March 1, 1919, thirty-three Korean cultural and religious leaders issued a "Proclamation of Independence" and organized mass demonstrations in Seoul.[^20]

As a student at Ewha Haktang, Yu witnessed the beginning of the March First Independence Movement firsthand.[^21] Her teacher, Kim Ransa—a Korean educator who had studied abroad and returned to inspire young women—encouraged Yu to join the student-led Ewha Literary Society (E-mun-hai), which organized peaceful protests.[^22] Together with her classmates, Yu attended several demonstrations in Seoul, marching to Namdaemun in central Seoul on March 1 and again on March 5, 1919.[^23] Female students were particularly active in Seoul, with most of those arrested on the morning of March 5 being girl students.[^24]

During these early protests, Yu and her classmates were detained by Japanese police but were freed shortly afterward when American missionaries from their school negotiated their release.[^25] On March 10, 1919, the Japanese Governor-General of Korea ordered all schools, including Ewha Women's School, to close temporarily in response to the growing unrest.[^26] This closure became the catalyst for Yu's most significant act of resistance, as she returned home to Cheonan and took on a far more active and dangerous role in the independence movement.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Upon returning to her village of Jiryeong-ri, Yu Gwan-sun transformed from participant to organizer, planning what would become one of the most significant demonstrations outside Seoul. Working alongside her father Yu Jungkwon, her uncle Yu Jungmu, and local leaders Cho In-won and Kim Goo-eung, she went door-to-door throughout neighboring towns including Yeongi, Chungju, Cheonan, and Jincheon, rallying people to join an organized demonstration.[^28]

The demonstration was meticulously planned for April 1, 1919, which corresponded to March 1 in the lunar calendar, deliberately chosen to align with the broader March First Movement.[^29] On March 31, Yu climbed to the top of Mount Maebong and lit a beacon fire, signaling to protesters across the region that the time had come to make their stand.[^30] The following morning at 9 a.m., approximately 3,000 demonstrators gathered at Aunae Marketplace, chanting "Long live Korean independence!" (독립만세!) in a peaceful protest.[^31]

The demonstration represented a remarkable achievement in grassroots organizing. At just 16 years old, Yu had mobilized thousands of rural Koreans from multiple towns to participate in coordinated nonviolent resistance.[^32] The protesters deliberately maintained a peaceful stance, consistent with the March First Movement's founding declaration that stated: "We entertain no spirit of vengeance towards Japan... [L]et there be no violence."[^33]

However, by 1 p.m., Japanese military police arrived and fired upon the unarmed protesters, killing 19 people, including Yu's own parents, Yu Jungkwon and Lee Soje.[^34] Rather than fleeing, Yu boldly complained to the authorities that it was unreasonable for the military police not to allow peaceful demonstration, leading to her immediate arrest and detention by the Cheonan Japanese military police unit.[^35] In retaliation for her defiance, Japanese forces burned her family's home to the ground.[^36]

Yu's continued resistance in prison became her most enduring achievement. After being transferred to Gongju District Court ten days after her initial detention, she faced a Japanese judge who demanded: "Will you swear that you will never engage in independence movement again and that you will live as subjects of the Japanese Empire?"[^37] The Japanese military police offered her a lighter sentence in exchange for an admission of guilt and cooperation in identifying other collaborators, but Yu refused and remained silent despite severe torture.[^38]

Sentenced to three years (some sources cite five years) at Seodaemun Prison in Seoul, Yu inspired her fellow female inmates never to lose hope.[^39] On March 1, 1920, she planned a large-scale protest with fellow prisoners to mark the movement's first anniversary, demonstrating that imprisonment could not extinguish her commitment to independence.[^40] As a result of this act of continued resistance, she was held separately from other inmates in an underground cell and subjected to even more brutal torture—reportedly 93 different types of torture.[^41]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Yu Gwan-sun is venerated as a national hero in South Korea, her legacy has not been without controversy, particularly regarding how her story has been politically instrumentalized. The most significant controversy emerged in 2015 when South Korean Education Minister Hwang Woo-yea questioned why Yu didn't appear in half of the nation's newly approved high school history textbooks under the Park Geun-hye administration.[^42] However, teachers and historians argued that Park's government was using Yu as a political excuse to promote textbooks that glossed over the 1961 military coup by Park's father, dictator Park Chung-hee, and his 18 years of authoritarian rule.[^43]

Park Chung-hee had previously banned private companies from publishing history textbooks and ran state-controlled versions that portrayed his coup as a revolution rather than a mutiny; publication rights were only partly restored to private companies in 1982 under his successor.[^44] This controversy reflected how textbooks became part of East Asia's propaganda war, with leaders fomenting nationalism to bolster their hold on power.[^45]

Some scholars have also debated the extent to which Yu's individual story has been mythologized at the expense of acknowledging the broader collective nature of the March First Movement. Yu Gwan-sun symbolizes women's agency in the anti-colonial struggle, with 471 women arrested during the March First Movement, yet the singular focus on her narrative may overshadow the contributions of countless other women activists.[^46]

Additionally, there have been scholarly debates around the romanization and spelling of her name. The Yu-Gwansun Memorial Association used "유" (Yu) from its founding in 1947, but changed to "류" (Ryu) in 2001, before reverting to "유" in 2014, citing a need to remove confusion given the consistent use of "유" by textbooks and official Korean government texts.[^47]

The comparison of Yu to Joan of Arc, while highlighting her martyrdom and young age, has also been critiqued as a Westernized framing that may not fully capture the specifically Korean historical and cultural context of her resistance.[^48] Furthermore, the discrepancy between Japanese and Korean casualty figures from the March First Movement—with Japanese authorities reporting 533 deaths while Korean sources claim over 7,500—raises questions about historical documentation and the politics of memory.[^49]

---

## Personal Life

Yu Gwan-sun's personal life was deeply intertwined with her Christian faith and her commitment to Korean independence. Growing up in a devout Protestant household, she attended Maebong Presbyterian Church and was known for her exceptional ability to memorize scriptures.[^50] Her faith provided both moral guidance and a framework for her understanding of justice and human dignity under colonial oppression.

As a student at Ewha Haktang, Yu was recognized as an intelligent and dedicated scholar.[^51] Her personality combined intellectual curiosity with moral courage—qualities that would define her resistance activities. Fellow inmates at Seodaemun Prison later testified to her ability to inspire hope even in the darkest circumstances, suggesting a charismatic and resilient character.[^52]

Her relationships with family members were central to her activism. She worked closely with her father Yu Jungkwon and uncle Yu Jungmu in organizing the Aunae Marketplace demonstration, demonstrating strong family bonds and shared commitment to the independence cause.[^53] The brutal deaths of her parents during the demonstration she organized must have been profoundly traumatic, yet contemporary accounts suggest this tragedy only strengthened her resolve rather than breaking her spirit.

At just 16 years old when arrested, Yu never had the opportunity to marry or pursue the teaching career for which she had been training.[^54] Her youth makes her sacrifice particularly poignant—she gave her life for Korean independence before experiencing adult life. During interrogation and torture, she maintained her dignity and refused to cooperate with Japanese authorities, revealing an extraordinary strength of character.[^55]

Her cellmates in Prison Cell #8 at Seodaemun remembered her leadership and inspiration during their shared captivity.[^56] Even as her health deteriorated from torture and malnutrition, she continued to resist, planning the March 1, 1920 prison protest that would lead to her final, fatal period of isolation and intensified torture.[^57] She died around 8 a.m. on September 28, 1920, at age 17 (some sources say 18 by Korean age reckoning) from injuries sustained from torture and malnutrition.[^58]

## Legacy

Yu Gwan-sun's legacy extends far beyond her short life, making her one of the most enduring symbols of Korean independence and resistance. Authorities initially released her body in a Saucony Vacuum Company oil crate, but only relented due to pressure applied by Lulu Frey and Jeannette Walter, the principals of Ewha Haktang, who voiced their suspicions of torture to the public.[^59] On October 14, 1920, Yu's funeral was held at Jung-dong Church by Reverend Kim Jong-wu, and her body was buried in a public cemetery in Seoul's Itaewon district.[^60]

For decades after her death, Yu's story remained relatively obscure. It was not widely known until after Korea's liberation in 1945, when it was first publicly documented through an article titled "The Virgin of the Sunguk" written by Park Gye-joo on February 28, 1947, which led to the formation of the Yu Gwan-sun Commemoration Association.[^61] On March 1, 1962, during the administration of Park Chung-hee, Yu was posthumously awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation as part of a broader recognition of 204 Korean independence activists.[^62] Initially, she received a third-grade Independence Medal.[^63]

In 2019, on the occasion of the March First Movement's 100th anniversary, President Moon Jae-in's government upgraded Yu's honor to the Republic of Korea Medal—the highest of the five ranks of national decorations.[^64] Her parents, Yu Jungkwon and Lee Soje, who were killed at the Aunae Marketplace demonstration, received a presidential medal in 1963 and the Meritorious Patriot's Award in 1991.[^65]

Yu became known as "Korea's Joan of Arc," a comparison that former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon emphasized at a ceremony, describing her as a great young Korean woman who lost her freedom so others could be free.[^66] The Yu Gwan-sun memorial hall opened on April 1, 2003, to mark the 100th anniversary of her birth.[^67] The memorial hall in Cheonan holds her life story through various interactive exhibits and multimedia, while at Jung-gu in central Seoul stands the Ewha Museum commemorating her life.[^68] Her memorial shrine was erected in 1972, with annual memorial ceremonies held on the anniversary of her death.[^69]

In 2018, The New York Times published an obituary for Yu as part of its "Overlooked No More" series, which provides obituaries to remarkable people whose deaths were not covered at their initial time of death—part of an effort to address the historical dominance of white men in the paper's obituaries.[^70] On February 27, 2024, New York State designated March 1 as Yu Gwan-sun Day.[^71]

The March First Movement, which Yu helped lead, is celebrated annually as Samiljeol, a national holiday in South Korea.[^72] The South Korean constitution mentions the movement in its first sentence: "We, the people of Korea, proud of a resplendent history and traditions dating from time immemorial, upholding the cause of the Provisional Republic of Korea Government born of the March First Independence Movement of 1919..."[^73]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians widely celebrate Yu Gwan-sun as a powerful symbol of Korean resistance and women's agency in anti-colonial struggle. Academic literature in memory studies emphasizes how Yu represents women's roles in the independence movement, symbolizing courage and sacrifice during Korea's most revered manifestation of anti-colonial resistance.[^74] The March First Movement generated voluminous literature, presidential speeches, and numerous monuments, with Yu's story occupying a central place in this commemorative landscape.[^75]

Feminist scholars particularly highlight Yu's significance as an inspiration for young women's political participation and activism. At a time when education for women was extremely rare and women's public political engagement was virtually unheard of, Yu's leadership in organizing mass demonstrations challenged both colonial oppression and patriarchal limitations.[^76] She remains a figurehead for Korean independence and inspires young women with her smart defiance.[^77]

The most famous young woman of the March First Movement, Yu has been called the "Nation's Sister" and the "Flower of the Independence Movement" in historical records.[^78] Her story continues to be taught in Korean schools as part of celebrating Samiljeol, ensuring that successive generations understand her sacrifice.[^79] Contemporary interpretations connect her legacy to ongoing struggles for justice and human rights, with some drawing parallels to modern resistance movements.[^80]

International recognition has also grown significantly. The New York Times' decision to include Yu in its "Overlooked No More" series reflects a global acknowledgment of her historical significance and the broader recognition of women's contributions to independence movements worldwide.[^81] Her designation as "Korea's Joan of Arc" by international observers has helped communicate her martyrdom to global audiences.[^82]

### Negative Views

Critical historians have raised concerns about the mythologization of Yu Gwan-sun's individual story at the expense of acknowledging the broader collective nature of the March First Movement. While 471 women were arrested during the movement, the singular focus on Yu's narrative may overshadow the contributions of countless other activists who also endured torture, imprisonment, and death.[^83] This individualization of resistance risks creating a "great person" narrative that obscures the fundamentally mass character of the independence struggle.

Some scholars question whether the "Joan of Arc" comparison represents an inappropriate Westernization of Yu's story, imposing European historical frameworks onto a specifically Korean context of anti-colonial resistance.[^84] This framing may also inadvertently diminish Yu's agency by comparing her to a religious mystic rather than emphasizing her role as a political organizer and strategist.

The political instrumentalization of Yu's legacy has been particularly controversial. As noted earlier, the Park Geun-hye government's invocation of Yu Gwan-sun while simultaneously promoting textbooks that whitewashed her father's dictatorship revealed how nationalist symbols can be cynically deployed to serve authoritarian agendas.[^85] Teachers and historians argued that this represented a manipulation of Yu's memory that betrayed her fundamental commitment to freedom and self-determination.[^86]

The textbook controversy also highlighted how Yu's story became part of East Asia's broader propaganda wars, with governments fomenting nationalism to bolster their political power.[^87] Critics argue that this nationalist framing can oversimplify the complex historical dynamics of Japanese colonialism, the March First Movement, and Korean independence activism.

Additionally, some historians note discrepancies in the historical record regarding specific details of Yu's life and actions, with variations in accounts of her sentencing (three versus five years), the exact number of people killed at Aunae Marketplace, and the specific types of torture she endured.[^88] While these discrepancies don't diminish her sacrifice, they do raise questions about how memory and documentation shape historical narratives, particularly regarding events that occurred under colonial censorship and suppression.
