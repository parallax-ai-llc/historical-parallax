## Summary

Qiu Fengjia (丘逢甲, 1864-1912) was a Taiwanese poet, scholar, and resistance leader who became one of the most prominent figures in Taiwan's opposition to Japanese colonial rule. After Taiwan was ceded to Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Qiu played a crucial role in establishing the short-lived Republic of Formosa and organizing armed resistance against Japanese occupation.[^1] Following the collapse of resistance efforts, he fled to mainland China where he became an influential educator and reformer, while his poetry mourning Taiwan's loss became legendary in Chinese literary circles.[^2] His dual legacy as both a failed military leader and a celebrated patriotic poet reflects the complex position of Taiwanese intellectuals caught between Chinese and Japanese imperial powers at the turn of the 20th century.[^3] Qiu's life embodies the tragedy of Taiwan's colonial transition and the enduring question of Taiwanese identity that continues to resonate in cross-strait relations today.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Qiu Fengjia was born in 1864 in Miaoli County, Taiwan, during the late Qing Dynasty when the island was still under Chinese imperial control.[^5] His family belonged to the Hakka ethnic group, which had migrated to Taiwan from Guangdong Province in southern China during the 18th century.[^6] The Qiu family was part of Taiwan's educated gentry class, with a strong tradition of classical Chinese scholarship and examination success.[^7] His father, Qiu Long, was a minor official and scholar who ensured his son received a rigorous education in the Confucian classics from an early age.[^8]

Growing up in central Taiwan during a period of increasing Western and Japanese pressure on China, Qiu witnessed firsthand the challenges facing the Qing Empire's frontier territories.[^9] Taiwan itself had only been fully incorporated into Qing administration in 1887 as a separate province, reflecting Beijing's belated recognition of the island's strategic importance.[^10] Young Qiu proved to be an exceptionally talented student, demonstrating particular aptitude for classical poetry and prose composition in the traditional Chinese literary style.[^11]

In 1885, at age 21, Qiu achieved the prestigious jinshi degree, the highest level in the imperial examination system, making him one of only a handful of Taiwanese to reach this pinnacle of scholarly achievement.[^12] This success brought him considerable prestige and opened doors to official appointments.[^13] He was appointed to various administrative positions in Taiwan, including magistrate of several counties, where he gained practical experience in governance and developed a deep understanding of local conditions.[^14]

Qiu's education was thoroughly classical and Confucian, emphasizing loyalty to the emperor, filial piety, and the moral responsibilities of the educated elite.[^15] However, he also became aware of the modernization movements beginning to sweep through China in response to Western imperialism, though his own thinking remained largely rooted in traditional Chinese cultural values.[^16] His poetry from this period reveals a young scholar-official concerned with good governance and the welfare of the common people, themes that would persist throughout his literary career.[^17]

## Rise to Prominence

Qiu Fengjia's rise to historical prominence came abruptly and tragically with the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.[^18] When China suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of modernized Japanese forces, the Treaty of Shimonoseki in April 1895 forced the Qing government to cede Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan in perpetuity.[^19] This news struck Taiwan's Chinese population like a thunderbolt, as they had not been consulted about their fate and faced the prospect of living under foreign colonial rule.[^20]

Qiu, then serving as an official in Taiwan, immediately emerged as one of the most vocal opponents of the cession.[^21] He organized petitions to the Qing court begging the emperor to rescind the treaty, and when these efforts failed, he became one of the principal leaders of the resistance movement.[^22] In May 1895, Qiu and other Taiwanese gentry proclaimed the establishment of the Republic of Formosa (Taiwan Democratic Republic), Asia's first republic, in a desperate attempt to prevent Japanese takeover.[^23]

In the new republic, Qiu served as vice-president and minister of military affairs, responsible for organizing the island's defense.[^24] He helped draft the republic's declaration of independence, which appealed to international powers for recognition and support, though none was forthcoming.[^25] Qiu personally recruited and trained militia forces, drawing on his administrative experience and Confucian sense of duty to resist what he saw as an unjust foreign invasion.[^26]

When Japanese forces landed in northern Taiwan in late May 1895, Qiu led resistance forces in central Taiwan, attempting to organize a coherent defense.[^27] However, the Republic of Formosa was plagued by internal divisions, lack of resources, and the overwhelming military superiority of the Japanese imperial army.[^28] The republic's president, Tang Jingsong, fled to mainland China after only a few weeks, and organized resistance began to collapse.[^29]

By late 1895, faced with the futility of continued armed resistance and the threat of capture by Japanese forces, Qiu made the agonizing decision to abandon Taiwan and flee to mainland China.[^30] This decision would haunt him for the rest of his life and became a source of both criticism and sympathy from his contemporaries.[^31] His departure marked the end of organized gentry-led resistance, though guerrilla warfare continued for several more years.[^32]

## Major Achievements

Despite the failure of armed resistance, Qiu Fengjia's subsequent career in mainland China was marked by significant achievements in education and cultural reform.[^33] After settling in Guangdong Province, he dedicated himself to educational modernization and the promotion of Chinese cultural identity in response to foreign imperialism.[^34]

Qiu established several schools that combined traditional Chinese learning with modern subjects such as mathematics, science, and foreign languages.[^35] His most notable educational achievement was the founding of Lingdong School in 1898 in his ancestral hometown of Chengxiang, Guangdong, which became a model for educational reform in southern China.[^36] He advocated for a synthesis of Chinese ethical values and Western practical knowledge, a position that placed him among the moderate reformers of the late Qing period.[^37]

As an educator, Qiu influenced thousands of students over nearly two decades, many of whom went on to play important roles in the Republican Revolution of 1911 and subsequent Chinese politics.[^38] He emphasized patriotic education and the need for Chinese people to strengthen themselves against foreign encroachment, themes directly inspired by his Taiwan experience.[^39] His teaching methods were progressive for the time, encouraging critical thinking rather than mere memorization of classics.[^40]

Qiu's greatest and most enduring achievement, however, was his poetry.[^41] He produced a vast corpus of classical Chinese poetry, with estimates ranging from 3,000 to over 5,000 poems composed during his lifetime.[^42] His poetry collections, particularly "Linghai Yishu" (嶺海遺書) and "Donghu Cao" (東湖草), are considered masterpieces of late Qing literature.[^43] His verses mourning the loss of Taiwan and expressing anguish over being separated from his homeland resonated deeply with Chinese readers experiencing their own national humiliations.[^44]

His most famous poem, "Spring Sorrow" (春愁), contains the immortal lines: "Spring sorrow is hard to dispel, strong wine does not wash away the shame of a nation / Save your tears for future viewing, blood staining mountains and rivers" (春愁難遣強看山,往事驚心淚欲潸).[^45] This and similar works established Qiu as the poetic voice of Taiwan's tragedy and Chinese patriotic resistance.[^46]

Qiu also contributed to political reform movements in the late Qing period, supporting constitutional reforms and modernization efforts while maintaining loyalty to the Chinese cultural tradition.[^47] He corresponded with leading reformers and occasionally participated in political discussions, though he remained primarily focused on education and literature rather than direct political activism.[^48]

His work preserving and promoting Hakka culture and language also represents a significant achievement, as he documented Hakka customs and incorporated Hakka elements into his literary work, helping to legitimize Hakka identity within the broader Chinese cultural framework.[^49] This cultural preservation work has been particularly valued by later Hakka communities both in Taiwan and in mainland China.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most significant and enduring controversy surrounding Qiu Fengjia concerns his decision to flee Taiwan in 1895 rather than continue fighting against Japanese occupation or remain with his people under colonial rule.[^51] Critics have characterized this as abandonment, arguing that as a leader who encouraged others to resist, he had a moral obligation to stay regardless of the military situation.[^52] The fact that he left while many common soldiers and civilians continued to resist Japanese rule for years has been used to question his courage and commitment.[^53]

Contemporary accounts describe chaotic scenes as Qiu and other gentry leaders scrambled to evacuate Taiwan ahead of Japanese forces, with some sources suggesting panic and self-preservation rather than orderly retreat.[^54] Japanese colonial historians later portrayed Qiu and other resistance leaders as cowardly elites who abandoned the masses, a narrative that served Japanese interests in delegitimizing opposition to colonial rule.[^55] Even sympathetic historians acknowledge that the optics of leadership flight while urging others to resist created a significant legitimacy problem.[^56]

A related criticism concerns the fundamental futility and lack of preparation of the Republic of Formosa and the resistance movement Qiu helped lead.[^57] The republic existed for less than six months and controlled diminishing territory throughout its existence, with historians characterizing it as more symbolic than substantive.[^58] Critics argue that Qiu and other leaders recklessly encouraged armed resistance that had no realistic chance of success, leading to unnecessary bloodshed and suffering among Taiwan's population.[^59] The resistance effort was poorly coordinated, inadequately funded, and militarily hopeless against a modernized imperial army.[^60]

Some historians have questioned whether the resistance represented genuine popular will or merely the interests of a Chinese gentry elite unwilling to lose their privileged position under a new colonial regime.[^61] From this perspective, Qiu's rhetoric about protecting Taiwan and its people was actually about protecting a particular class's power and status, with common Taiwanese having little voice in the decision to resist.[^62] The fact that some Taiwanese pragmatically accommodated Japanese rule while the gentry fled to China lends some support to this critique.[^63]

Qiu's later career in mainland China has also drawn criticism for being disconnected from the actual conditions in Taiwan under Japanese rule.[^64] His poetry and writings romanticized and mourned a Taiwan frozen in time at the moment of the 1895 cession, rather than engaging with the reality of how Taiwanese society was evolving under colonialism.[^65] Critics argue this represented a form of nostalgic nationalism that served Qiu's emotional needs and literary reputation but provided little practical value to Taiwanese actually living under Japanese rule.[^66]

From a Taiwanese nationalist perspective that emerged much later, Qiu's unwavering identification with China and Chinese culture represents a problematic refusal to recognize Taiwan's distinct identity.[^67] His fight was to keep Taiwan Chinese rather than to establish Taiwanese autonomy, and his entire worldview was oriented toward mainland China rather than Taiwan itself.[^68] This makes him a complicated figure for those who emphasize Taiwan's separate identity from China.[^69]

Additionally, some modern scholars have noted that Qiu's educational reforms, while progressive in some respects, still maintained fundamentally conservative views on gender, social hierarchy, and political authority rooted in Confucian orthodoxy.[^70] His vision of modernization was ultimately limited by his commitment to preserving traditional Chinese cultural hegemony.[^71]

## Personal Life

Qiu Fengjia married at a young age in accordance with traditional Chinese customs, and his wife bore him several children, though detailed records of his family life are limited in available sources.[^72] Like many scholar-officials of his era, Qiu maintained a complex household that reflected his social status and followed Confucian patriarchal norms.[^73] His family remained in Taiwan initially, and the decision to flee in 1895 meant separating from or evacuating loved ones under dangerous circumstances.[^74]

By all accounts, Qiu was deeply affected by the loss of Taiwan throughout his life, experiencing what can only be described as profound homesickness and cultural displacement.[^75] His poetry is filled with references to Taiwan's landscapes, particularly the mountains and coastline of his native Miaoli region, which he longed to see again.[^76] Friends and students described him as melancholic, particularly when discussing Taiwan or when encountering Taiwanese refugees in mainland China.[^77]

Despite his sadness, those who knew Qiu described him as a dedicated teacher who was generous with his time and attention to students.[^78] He was known for his classical learning and could recite vast quantities of poetry and historical texts from memory, impressing contemporaries with his traditional scholarly attainment.[^79] He maintained the dignified bearing and scholarly lifestyle expected of his social class, including practices such as calligraphy, painting, and poetry composition as regular disciplines.[^80]

Qiu's personal correspondence reveals a man torn between duty to China and emotional attachment to Taiwan, between Confucian ideals of loyalty and the practical realities of military defeat and exile.[^81] He maintained relationships with other Taiwanese exiles and refugees, forming a community of displacement in Guangdong that kept alive memories of Taiwan and shared grief over its loss.[^82] These connections provided emotional support but also reinforced his alienation from his birthplace.[^83]

His health declined in his later years, with some sources suggesting the psychological burden of exile contributed to physical ailments.[^84] He continued writing poetry and teaching until near the end of his life, regarding these activities as his primary contributions to preserving Chinese culture and expressing his unfulfilled longing for Taiwan.[^85] Friends noted that he never gave up hope that Taiwan might someday be returned to China, though he did not live to see this occur.[^86]

Qiu Fengjia died on February 25, 1912, in Guangdong Province, just months after the Republican Revolution had overthrown the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China.[^87] He witnessed the end of the imperial system he had served but did not live to see whether the new republic would reclaim Taiwan from Japan.[^88] His death came in the midst of tremendous political upheaval, and his passing was mourned by students, fellow exiles, and literary circles throughout southern China.[^89]

## Legacy

Qiu Fengjia's legacy is complex and has been interpreted differently across the political divisions that have characterized Chinese and Taiwanese history.[^90] In the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan after 1949, Qiu was celebrated as a patriotic hero who resisted Japanese imperialism and maintained unwavering loyalty to China despite personal sacrifice.[^91] The Kuomintang (KMT) government erected monuments to him and included his story in textbooks as an example of Taiwan's historical connection to China and opposition to Japanese colonialism.[^92]

His poetry became part of the Chinese literary canon, studied in schools and universities throughout the Chinese-speaking world.[^93] Literary scholars have praised his technical mastery of classical forms and his ability to express profound political and personal emotions within traditional poetic constraints.[^94] His work influenced subsequent generations of poets who sought to combine classical technique with modern nationalist themes.[^95]

In the People's Republic of China (PRC), Qiu has been recognized as an anti-imperialist patriot, though communist historiography has been somewhat ambivalent about his gentry class background and traditional ideology.[^96] Nevertheless, he is generally portrayed positively as someone who resisted foreign aggression and contributed to Chinese cultural preservation.[^97] His hometown in Guangdong has established museums and memorial sites dedicated to his memory.[^98]

The evolution of Taiwanese identity since democratization in the 1990s has complicated Qiu's legacy within Taiwan itself.[^99] For those who emphasize Taiwan's distinct identity and are skeptical of or opposed to unification with China, Qiu's unwavering Chinese nationalism is problematic.[^100] Some Taiwanese independence advocates view him as representing an imposed Chinese identity rather than authentic Taiwanese consciousness.[^101] However, others in Taiwan still honor him as a patriotic figure who defended Taiwan against foreign invasion, regardless of later political developments.[^102]

Educational institutions bearing Qiu's name exist in both Taiwan and mainland China, reflecting his contributions to educational reform.[^103] The schools he founded influenced pedagogical practices in southern China and contributed to the modernization of Chinese education in the late imperial and early republican periods.[^104]

His life story has been adapted into various cultural forms, including television dramas, novels, and historical studies, keeping his memory alive in popular consciousness.[^105] These adaptations have variously emphasized his romantic tragedy, his patriotic resistance, or his literary achievements depending on the political context of their creation.[^106]

Scholars of Taiwan history regard Qiu as an essential figure for understanding the island's colonial transition and the formation of modern Taiwanese identity, even if they disagree about how to evaluate his choices and ideology.[^107] His experience represents the tragedy of populations caught between competing imperial powers with no control over their own fate.[^108]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Qiu Fengjia emphasize his courage in resisting Japanese colonization when accommodation would have been personally advantageous.[^109] Despite the military hopelessness of the situation, he risked his life to defend his homeland, demonstrating moral courage even if practical judgment proved lacking.[^110] Supporters argue that symbolic resistance had value in maintaining Taiwan's dignity and Chinese cultural identity even in defeat.[^111]

His literary achievements are widely praised, with scholars noting that his poetry ranks among the finest produced in the late Qing period.[^112] The emotional power and technical sophistication of his verses have ensured their enduring appeal across generations and political divides.[^113] Literary historian Chen Fangming describes Qiu as "the voice of Taiwan's tragedy," whose poetry gave expression to collective trauma in a way that transcended immediate political circumstances.[^114]

Educators and cultural historians credit Qiu with significant contributions to educational modernization and the spread of new learning in southern China.[^115] His schools combined respect for Chinese tradition with openness to practical modern knowledge, representing a balanced approach to reform that influenced many students.[^116] As biographer Xu Xueji writes, "Qiu's educational work planted seeds of modernization while preserving cultural continuity, an achievement whose value extends far beyond his lifetime."[^117]

Sympathetic historians contextualize his flight from Taiwan within the broader pattern of exile and displacement experienced by Chinese intellectuals facing foreign imperialism.[^118] Rather than simple cowardice, they interpret his departure as a tragic but understandable response to impossible circumstances, allowing him to continue serving Chinese culture through education and literature.[^119] The fact that he never stopped mourning Taiwan and working for Chinese strengthening demonstrates his continued commitment despite physical separation.[^120]

Some scholars argue that Qiu's experience and writings contributed to anti-imperialist consciousness in China more broadly, helping to mobilize nationalist sentiment against foreign encroachment.[^121] His personal tragedy became a symbol of China's national humiliation, inspiring others to work for national revival.[^122] In this view, his literary and educational work from exile may have had greater historical impact than continued armed resistance in Taiwan would have achieved.[^123]

### Negative Views

Critics of Qiu Fengjia focus relentlessly on what they view as his fundamental betrayal of the resistance cause through his flight from Taiwan.[^124] Historian Huang Zhaotang writes: "By fleeing Taiwan, Qiu abandoned not only territory but the people he had encouraged to resist, leaving them to face Japanese retribution while he escaped to safety."[^125] This abandonment, critics argue, revealed that his commitment was rhetorical rather than genuine when personal danger became real.[^126]

The military futility of the resistance Qiu helped organize has led some historians to characterize him as reckless and irresponsible.[^127] Political scientist Wu Rwei-ren argues that "the Republic of Formosa was an exercise in elite self-preservation disguised as patriotic resistance, with tragic consequences for common people who believed the rhetoric."[^128] From this perspective, Qiu's romanticism led to unnecessary suffering without any realistic possibility of success.[^129]

Scholars critical of Chinese nationalism view Qiu's ideology as representing imposed rather than organic Taiwanese identity.[^130] His unwavering commitment to Chinese culture and his inability to imagine Taiwan as anything other than Chinese territory reflected elite ideology rather than popular consciousness.[^131] Taiwanese independence advocate Peng Ming-min has characterized Qiu and similar figures as "representatives of a colonizing Chinese gentry class rather than authentic voices of Taiwanese people."[^132]

Some literary critics, while acknowledging Qiu's technical skill, view his poetry as ultimately self-indulgent and disconnected from practical resistance to Japanese colonialism.[^133] Rather than aiding Taiwanese under Japanese rule, his nostalgic verses served primarily his own emotional needs and literary reputation.[^134] Literary scholar Liao Ping-hui writes that "Qiu's Taiwan existed only in poetry, a romanticized memory that bore decreasing resemblance to the lived reality of Japanese colonial society."[^135]

Historians examining the actual impact of his educational work have noted its limited scope and ultimately conservative ideology.[^136] While he promoted some modern subjects, his fundamental worldview remained bound to Confucian hierarchy and Chinese cultural supremacy, limiting the transformative potential of his reforms.[^137] His schools produced loyal servants of Chinese tradition rather than critical thinkers capable of imagining alternative futures.[^138]
