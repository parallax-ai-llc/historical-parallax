## Summary

Confucius (Kong Fuzi, 孔夫子, 551-479 BC) was a Chinese philosopher, teacher, and political theorist whose ideas became the foundation of Confucianism, one of the most influential philosophical systems in East Asian history. Born Kong Qiu in the State of Lu during China's Spring and Autumn period, Confucius developed a comprehensive ethical and political philosophy centered on ren (benevolence, 仁), li (proper conduct and rituals, 禮), and the cultivation of virtue through education. Though he sought but never obtained high political office, his teachings—preserved primarily in the Analects (Lunyu, 論語)—profoundly shaped Chinese civilization for over 2,500 years, influencing government, education, family structures, and moral values throughout East Asia and beyond.

## Early Life and Background

### Birth and Family

Confucius (Kong Qiu, 孔丘, courtesy name Zhongni, 仲尼) was born in 551 BC in Zou (鄒), a town in the State of Lu (魯國, in modern Shandong Province, China). His family name was Kong (孔), personal name Qiu (丘).

**Family Origins:**
- Descended from nobility of the State of Song
- Family had fallen on hard times by his generation
- Father: Kong He (孔紇), an elderly military officer
- Mother: Yan Zhengzai (顏徵在), much younger concubine
- Father died when Confucius was three years old

Confucius grew up in poverty, raised by his mother. Despite humble circumstances, awareness of his aristocratic ancestry apparently influenced his later emphasis on restoring proper rituals and hierarchy.

### Early Education

In a society where education was largely restricted to nobility, Confucius's mother ensured he received learning. He was largely self-taught, studying ancient Chinese texts, history, poetry, music, and rituals intensively.

Young Confucius reportedly worked humble jobs:
- Keeper of granaries
- Supervisor of pastures
- Accountant

These experiences exposed him to common people and practical governance, informing his later political philosophy. He married at age 19 to Qiguan (亓官氏) and had a son (Kong Li, 孔鯉) and possibly daughters.

## Development as Teacher

### Founding a School

Around age 30, Confucius established himself as a teacher—revolutionary in an era when education was monopoly of nobility. He accepted students regardless of social class, requiring only "a bundle of dried meat" (symbolic tuition) and genuine desire to learn.

**Teaching Philosophy:**
- Education should develop moral character, not just skills
- Learning requires personal cultivation and practice
- Students should question and discuss, not merely memorize
- The sage studies the past to guide the present
- "When I walk along with two others, they may serve me as my teachers"

**Curriculum:**
The "Six Arts" (六藝):
1. Rites/Ritual propriety (禮)
2. Music (樂)
3. Archery (射)
4. Charioteering (御)
5. Calligraphy/Writing (書)
6. Mathematics (數)

Confucius reportedly taught 3,000 students, with 72 particularly accomplished disciples.

### Compilation of Classics

Confucius devoted much energy to studying, editing, and transmitting ancient texts, helping preserve China's cultural heritage. Tradition credits him with editing:
- **The Book of Songs** (Shijing, 詩經): 305 poems
- **The Book of Documents** (Shujing, 書經): Historical documents
- **The Book of Rites** (Liji, 禮記): Ritual texts
- **The Book of Changes** (Yijing, 易經): Divination text
- **Spring and Autumn Annals** (Chunqiu, 春秋): Lu state history

Modern scholars debate his direct authorship, but his school clearly transmitted these works.

## Political Career and Travels

### Brief Government Service

Around age 50, Confucius finally obtained government positions in Lu:
- **Minister of Crime** (司寇, Sikou): Justice minister
- Reportedly achieved such effective governance that crime nearly disappeared
- Demonstrated excellence in managing state rituals

However, political intrigue forced him from office around age 55-56. Rival states allegedly sent beautiful dancers and fine horses to Lu's ruler, distracting him from governance. Disgusted by the ruler's neglect of duty, Confucius resigned.

### The Wandering Years (497-484 BC)

For approximately 13 years, Confucius traveled through various Chinese states seeking a ruler who would implement his ideas. He visited:
- Wei (衛)
- Song (宋)
- Qi (齊)
- Chen (陳)
- Cai (蔡)
- Chu (楚)

**Experiences:**
- Welcomed by some rulers as honored guest
- Saw his advice rejected or ignored
- Faced dangers including near-starvation and threats to his life
- In Song, a tree he was resting under was cut down to kill him
- Several times mistaken for a wanted criminal

Despite never finding a ruler willing to fully implement his vision, these travels:
- Deepened his understanding of governance and human nature
- Exposed him to various states and customs
- Allowed him to refine his teachings
- Gathered more disciples

### Return to Lu

Around age 68 (484 BC), Confucius returned to Lu, welcomed with honor but not given significant office. He devoted his final years to:
- Teaching and refining his philosophy
- Editing classical texts
- Compiling the Spring and Autumn Annals
- Training the next generation of disciples

## Core Philosophy

### Ren (仁) - Benevolence/Humaneness

**Central Virtue:**
Confucius's philosophy centers on *ren* (仁), often translated as benevolence, humaneness, or human-heartedness. While difficult to define precisely, ren encompasses:
- Compassion and empathy for others
- Treating others as you wish to be treated (similar to Golden Rule)
- The highest moral perfection
- The essence of being fully human

**Achieving Ren:**
- Through self-cultivation and ethical practice
- Begins with filial piety (孝, xiao) and respect for elders
- Extends to all human relationships
- Expressed through proper conduct (li)

### Li (禮) - Ritual Propriety

**Proper Conduct:**
*Li* refers to proper behavior, ritual, ceremony, and social norms. Confucius emphasized:
- Rituals preserve social harmony and hierarchy
- External forms cultivate internal virtue
- Sincerity must accompany ritual
- "Ritual without ren is empty formality"

**Applications:**
- Ancestor worship ceremonies
- Court etiquette
- Social interactions
- Music and arts
- Government ceremonies

Li provided structure for all social relationships and political order.

### The Five Relationships (五倫)

Confucius identified five fundamental relationships governing society:

1. **Ruler-Subject** (君臣): Loyalty and benevolent governance
2. **Father-Son** (父子): Filial piety and paternal care
3. **Husband-Wife** (夫婦): Separate roles, mutual respect
4. **Elder-Younger Brother** (兄弟): Respect for seniority
5. **Friend-Friend** (朋友): Mutual trust and equality

Each relationship has reciprocal obligations. Three emphasize hierarchy (ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife), while elder-younger and friend-friend allow more equality.

### Junzi (君子) - The Superior Person

**Ideal Person:**
The *junzi* (君子, "gentleman" or "superior person") represents Confucius's ideal of moral perfection:
- Originally meant "ruler's son" (aristocrat)
- Confucius redefined it as morally cultivated person regardless of birth
- Opposite of *xiaoren* (小人, "small person" or petty person)

**Characteristics:**
- Pursues moral cultivation over profit
- Studies classics and history
- Practices self-examination
- Treats subordinates with benevolence
- Follows principle over expediency
- Takes responsibility for failures

### Rectification of Names (正名)

**Proper Roles:**
Confucius taught that social harmony requires people to fulfill their proper roles:
- "Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, the father a father, the son a son"
- When names (titles/roles) don't match reality, social order collapses
- Proper language reflects and creates proper reality

This doctrine had profound political implications: rulers who fail to govern benevolently aren't true rulers.

### Filial Piety (孝)

**Foundation of Morality:**
*Xiao* (孝, filial piety)—respect and care for parents and ancestors—is the root of ren:
- Begins in family, extends to society
- Children must obey, care for, and honor parents
- Continues after death through ancestor worship
- Foundational to all other virtues

**Three Years Mourning:**
Confucius prescribed three years of mourning for deceased parents, showing extreme devotion.

## Political Philosophy

### Virtuous Governance

Confucius advocated rule by moral example rather than force:
- **"Govern by moral force (de) and people will be orderly through shame and develop a sense of honor"**
- **"Govern by laws and punishments, people will try to evade and have no sense of shame"**

**Key Principles:**
- Leaders must cultivate personal virtue
- Virtue flows downward; people imitate rulers
- Benevolent rule earns genuine loyalty
- Harsh laws create resentment and rebellion

### Meritocracy

Revolutionary for his time, Confucius believed:
- Government positions should go to talented, virtuous people
- Not hereditary nobility alone
- Education should prepare men for public service
- Examinations can identify the worthy

This idea eventually led to China's civil service examination system (though not until centuries later).

### The Mandate of Heaven

While accepting existing political hierarchy, Confucius's philosophy contained potential for political critique:
- Rulers hold power by Heaven's mandate
- Mandate depends on virtuous rule
- Tyrants lose the mandate
- Justifies rebellion against unjust rulers (though Confucius didn't explicitly advocate rebellion)

## Death and Legacy

### Final Years

Confucius's later years were marked by sadness:
- His son Kong Li died before him
- Several favorite disciples died, including Yan Hui (most beloved student)
- He lamented that no ruler had implemented his vision

According to tradition, when a strange animal (possibly a qilin, mythical creature) was killed in Lu, Confucius took it as omen and stopped writing the Spring and Autumn Annals, saying, "My Way is finished."

### Death (479 BC)

Confucius died in 479 BC at age 72 in Qufu, Lu. According to the *Records of the Grand Historian* (Shiji), his final words expressed disappointment that no ruler had employed him.

He was buried north of Qufu in what became the Kong Family Cemetery (Kong Lin). His descendants maintained the tomb for over 2,500 years.

### Immediate Aftermath

After Confucius's death, his disciples scattered to various states, spreading his teachings. His home became a temple (Kong Temple, 孔廟), eventually China's second-largest ancient architectural complex.

His direct descendants, the Kong family, became one of China's most prominent families, maintaining hereditary nobility until the 20th century.

## The Analects and Teachings

### The Analects (論語)

Confucius wrote no systematic philosophical treatise. His teachings were compiled by disciples in the *Analects* (Lunyu, 論語), composed after his death.

**Structure:**
- 20 books
- 500+ brief passages
- Mix of aphorisms, dialogues, and anecdotes
- Fragmented,  not systematic

**Style:**
- Terse, profound statements
- Dialogues responding to disciples' questions
- Situational ethics rather than abstract principles
- Open to interpretation

### Key Teachings

**On Learning:**
> "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous."

> "When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it; this is knowledge."

**On Virtue:**
> "The superior man thinks of virtue; the small man thinks of comfort."

> "To see what is right and not do it is want of courage."

**On Government:**
> "To govern is to correct. If you set an example by being correct, who would dare to remain incorrect?"

> "If a ruler himself is upright, all will go well without orders. But if he himself is not upright, even though he gives orders they will not be obeyed."

**On Relationships:**
> "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others." (Negative formulation of Golden Rule)

> "The father who does not teach his son his duties is equally guilty with the son who neglects them."

## Historical Development of Confucianism

### Early Period (479-221 BC)

After Confucius's death, Confucianism was one school among many (Hundred Schools of Thought):
- **Mencius** (372-289 BC): Emphasized innate human goodness, developed ren further
- **Xunzi** (313-238 BC): Argued human nature is evil, emphasized li and education

Confucianism competed with:
- Daoism (Laozi, Zhuangzi)
- Legalism (Han Feizi)
- Mohism (Mozi)

### Imperial Adoption (Han Dynasty, 206 BC - 220 AD)

**Emperor Wu** (141-87 BC) made Confucianism state ideology:
- Established imperial academy studying Confucian classics
- Civil service based on Confucian learning
- "Dismissed hundred schools, esteemed only Confucianism"

This gave Confucianism dominance lasting 2,000 years.

### Neo-Confucianism (Song Dynasty, 960-1279 AD)

**Zhu Xi** (1130-1200) synthesized Confucianism with Buddhist and Daoist metaphysics:
- Developed comprehensive cosmology
- Emphasized principle (li, 理) and material force (qi, 氣)
- Became orthodox interpretation in late imperial China

### Spread to East Asia

Confucianism profoundly influenced:
- **Korea**: Deeply Confucian political and social order
- **Japan**: Samurai code, bureaucracy
- **Vietnam**: Government, education

### Modern Challenges

**19th-20th Century:**
- Blamed for China's backwardness
- May Fourth Movement (1919) attacked Confucianism
- Communist Revolution rejected it as feudal
- Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) destroyed temples, persecuted scholars

**21st Century Revival:**
- China rehabilitating Confucianism
- "Asian values" debate
- Confucius Institutes worldwide
- Renewed interest in traditional ethics
