## Summary

Xue Qikun is a Chinese physicist at Tsinghua University who led the first experimental observation of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in 2013, achieving dissipationless electron flow without an external magnetic field. This breakthrough, predicted by his colleague Zhang Shouzheng, was one of the most important physics discoveries of the decade.
