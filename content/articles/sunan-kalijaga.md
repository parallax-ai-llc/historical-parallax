## Summary

Sunan Kalijaga (born Raden Mas Said; 1450–1513) was one of the nine revered saints of Islam in Indonesia known as the Wali Songo, who played a pivotal role in spreading Islam throughout Java during the 15th and 16th centuries.[^1] Born into Majapahit nobility as the son of Tumenggung Wilatikta, Duke of Tuban, he underwent a dramatic transformation from a notorious highwayman and gambler to become the most celebrated Islamic missionary in Javanese history.[^2] Sunan Kalijaga is renowned for his culturally adaptive approach to Islamic propagation, masterfully integrating Islamic teachings with indigenous Javanese traditions such as wayang kulit (shadow puppetry) and gamelan music, making Islam accessible and appealing to the local population without confrontation.[^3] His syncretic methods, though celebrated for facilitating widespread conversion, have also drawn criticism from orthodox Islamic scholars who argue his approach prioritized cultural accommodation over doctrinal purity.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Sunan Kalijaga was born in 1450 as Raden Mas Said in Tuban, East Java, into a noble family during the waning years of the Majapahit Kingdom, the greatest Hindu empire in the Indonesian archipelago.[^5] His father, Tumenggung Wilatikta, served as the Duke (regent) of Tuban, a coastal trading port that was experiencing significant social and economic transformation during this period of transition from Hindu-Buddhist to Islamic influence.[^6] According to genealogical records, Sunan Kalijaga's grandfather was named Aria Teja or Abdurrahman, an Arab descendant who played a role in introducing Islam to Aria Dikara, the Regent of Tuban, suggesting that Islamic influence had already penetrated his family lineage.[^7]

Despite his privileged upbringing and noble status, Raden Said's early life took a wayward turn. He was originally trained in traditional Javanese arts including gamelan music, silat martial arts, and possibly Qur'anic recitation, reflecting the cultural syncretism already present in Javanese noble education.[^8] However, amid the famine and social upheaval under the declining Majapahit rule, the young nobleman became addicted to gambling and opium, eventually turning to banditry.[^9] He became known as a "Cluring thief" who would rob the wealthy but distribute his stolen goods to impoverished people, earning him a reputation as a sort of Javanese Robin Hood figure.[^10]

Raden Said's life as a highwayman brought him into the orbit of the emerging Islamic missionary movement. The late 15th century was a period of profound religious transformation in Java, as Muslim traders and preachers from Arabia, Gujarat, Persia, and China established communities along Java's north coast.[^11] Some members of Majapahit's elite had converted to Islam as early as 1368, though widespread conversion of the trading port states didn't begin until the mid-fifteenth century.[^12] It was during this transitional period—when the old Hindu-Buddhist order was collapsing and new Islamic kingdoms like Demak were rising—that Raden Said would encounter the figure who would change his life forever.

## Rise to Power

The transformative moment in Sunan Kalijaga's life came through his fateful encounter with Sunan Bonang, another member of the Wali Songo and an established Islamic teacher.[^13] According to traditional accounts, Sunan Bonang deliberately confronted the notorious bandit to test and ultimately redeem him. In one version of the story, Sunan Bonang suggested to Raden Said that he should rob a person who would pass dressed in blue with a red hibiscus behind his ear.[^14] Three days later, when this person appeared, it was Sunan Bonang himself in disguise. When Raden Said attacked, Sunan Bonang displayed miraculous powers, transforming himself into four persons, which so traumatized the would-be robber that he underwent a profound spiritual crisis.[^15]

Inspired by Sunan Bonang's supernatural abilities and moral authority, Raden Said abandoned his life of crime and became Sunan Bonang's disciple.[^16] The rehabilitation process was long and arduous. According to tradition, Raden Said underwent a spiritual trial in which he was instructed to guard Sunan Bonang's walking stick beside a river (kali in Javanese) for an extended period—some accounts say three years—without moving, eating, or drinking, sustained only by divine grace.[^17] During this period of meditation and self-purification, Raden Said achieved enlightenment and realized the errors of his previous ways, learning from Sunan Bonang that "true truth is truth that is practiced correctly and brings goodness to everyone."[^18]

After successfully completing this trial, Raden Said earned the title "Kalijaga," with multiple explanations for its origin. Some sources suggest the name derives from an orchard known as "Kalijaga" in Cirebon, while others contend it comes from his habit of submerging himself in the kali (river) for meditation and purification.[^19] The most popular interpretation is that it references his long vigil beside the river while guarding Sunan Bonang's staff, combining kali (river) with jaga (to guard or watch).[^20] As Sunan Kalijaga, he became Sunan Bonang's star disciple and eventually emerged as the most influential of the Wali Songo.

Sunan Kalijaga's rise to prominence coincided with the establishment of the Demak Sultanate, the first Islamic kingdom in Java, around 1475.[^21] His noble background, deep understanding of Javanese culture, and newfound Islamic knowledge positioned him uniquely to bridge the Hindu-Buddhist past with the Islamic future. Unlike some other Islamic missionaries who took more confrontational approaches, Sunan Kalijaga understood that successful conversion required cultural sensitivity and adaptation, a philosophy that would define his entire missionary career.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Sunan Kalijaga's most significant achievement was developing and implementing a culturally adaptive approach to Islamic propagation that successfully converted millions of Javanese people without the violent conflict that often accompanied religious transitions elsewhere.[^23] His defining strategy involved integrating Islamic teachings with indigenous Javanese traditions, particularly through the creative use of wayang kulit (shadow puppetry) and gamelan music as vehicles for Islamic education.[^24] Before Sunan Kalijaga, wayang performances typically featured Hindu-Buddhist narratives from the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics. He ingeniously transformed these traditional entertainment forms by modifying the stories and characters to convey Islamic values, morals, and teachings about monotheism, prophetic narratives, and ethical conduct.[^25]

In his wayang performances, Sunan Kalijaga didn't demand payment except that spectators recite the two verses of the syahadat (Islamic creed), thereby facilitating mass conversions through cultural participation rather than theological coercion.[^26] He succeeded in combining Islamic values with predominant cultural elements influenced by Hinduism and Buddhism by using old Javanese and Sanskrit terms instead of Arabic terminology, making Islam feel less foreign and more like a natural extension of existing Javanese worldview.[^27] This linguistic and cultural adaptation was revolutionary, allowing Islamic concepts to be communicated in ways that resonated with the local population's existing frames of reference.[^28]

Sunan Kalijaga also made significant contributions to Islamic architecture in Java, building or contributing to the construction of several important mosques. He was instrumental in building Masjid Agung Demak (the Great Mosque of Demak) in 1479 under Raden Fatah of the Demak Sultanate, and Masjid Agung Cirebon (Sang Cipta Rasa Mosque) in 1480.[^29] The Demak Great Mosque featured distinctive architectural elements that synthesized Javanese vernacular techniques with Islamic functional requirements, including a tiered pyramidal roof rather than a dome, supported by four saka guru (main pillars) contributed by different Wali Songo members.[^30] One unique pillar, called tatal, was made from wood chips arranged and compacted together, demonstrating innovative construction techniques.[^31] The Sang Cipta Rasa Mosque in Cirebon, built in collaboration with Sunan Gunung Jati and architect Raden Sepat from Majapahit, featured a three-tiered pyramidal roof resembling the traditional Javanese joglo style, with walls made from red brick installed without cement—a traditional technique preserved to this day.[^32]

Beyond architecture and performance arts, Sunan Kalijaga established several religious festivals and cultural practices that remain integral to Javanese Islamic identity. He introduced or popularized the Sekaten festival, a week-long celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's birthday featuring gamelan performances in mosque courtyards to attract people to Islamic gatherings.[^33] The name "Sekaten" derives from the Arabic "syahadatain," meaning the two sentences of the Islamic creed.[^34] He also established the Grebeg Maulud tradition, culminating on the 12th of Rabiul Awal with a procession of gunungan (mountain-shaped offerings) containing agricultural products symbolizing prosperity, which are distributed to the people who believe they provide protection from danger and disasters.[^35] Additionally, Sunan Kalijaga popularized the Baju Takwa, a traditional dress custom for Indonesian Muslims that blended Islamic modesty requirements with Javanese aesthetic sensibilities.[^36]

Sunan Kalijaga's teachings emphasized Sufistic mysticism (tasawuf) and spiritual knowledge (makrifat) rather than strict legalistic interpretations of Islamic law.[^37] His exegesis from the Quranic perspective led him to believe that people would resist missionary efforts if their personalities and existing practices were directly attacked, so he adopted a gradual, step-by-step approach following the principle of "following yet influencing," trusting that once people truly understood Islam, they would voluntarily abandon practices that contradicted Islamic teachings.[^38] This patient, non-confrontational methodology proved extraordinarily effective in a society deeply attached to its cultural heritage.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his celebrated status in Javanese Islamic tradition, Sunan Kalijaga's syncretic methods have generated significant controversy among Islamic scholars, particularly those emphasizing scriptural purity and orthodox tawhid (monotheism).[^39] Critics argue that his approach—which adapted wayang kulit shadow puppetry, gamelan music, and other pre-Islamic cultural forms—prioritized cultural accommodation over rigorous doctrinal enforcement, potentially resulting in widespread but superficial conversions rather than deep theological understanding.[^40] Reformist Islamic movements, especially those influenced by Salafi and Wahhabi ideologies, contend that Sunan Kalijaga's tolerance of local traditions led to the persistence of practices incompatible with orthodox Islam, including elements of animism, ancestor veneration, and spirit offerings.[^41]

The primary criticism centers on what scholars call "abangan Islam"—a syncretic variant of Islam characterized by ritualistic practices that blend Islamic, Hindu-Buddhist, animist, and kejawen (Javanese mysticism) elements.[^42] Critics point to traditions like slametan feasts, which incorporate ancestor veneration and spirit offerings, as evidence that Kalijaga's accommodationist approach failed to establish santri-style orthodoxy aligned with sharia law and hadith.[^43] These critics argue that by allowing pre-Islamic Javanese cosmology and ritual practices to persist under a thin Islamic veneer, Sunan Kalijaga inadvertently created a form of Islam that deviated from the religion's fundamental principles of pure monotheism and prophetic precedent.[^44]

Historical accounts also record theological disputes between different schools of thought among the Wali Songo themselves. There was a longstanding debate with Siti Jenar, another Javanese Islamic teacher, in which Sunan Bonang (Kalijaga's mentor) is portrayed as defending orthodox Islamic faith against Siti Jenar's "syncretic innovations" and mystical teachings that allegedly crossed into heresy.[^45] While Sunan Kalijaga himself maintained a more moderate position than Siti Jenar, his sympathies for cultural adaptation and mystical Sufism placed him in tension with more scripturalist approaches to Islamic propagation.[^46] This debate reflects fundamental questions about the appropriate balance between cultural accommodation and doctrinal purity that remain contentious in contemporary Indonesian Islam.

Some modern Islamic reformers have questioned whether Sunan Kalijaga's use of wayang puppetry was appropriate, given that traditional Islamic jurisprudence often prohibits or discourages the creation and veneration of images representing human or divine figures.[^47] The incorporation of gamelan music has also faced scrutiny, as some conservative scholars view musical instruments in religious contexts as potentially leading believers away from pure worship.[^48] These criticisms reflect ongoing tensions between traditionalist Muslims who honor the Wali Songo's legacy and modernist/reformist Muslims who seek to purify Indonesian Islam from what they perceive as un-Islamic innovations (bid'ah) and syncretism.[^49]

Additionally, the miraculous narratives surrounding Sunan Kalijaga—including his transformation from bandit to saint, his ability to create the tatal pillar from wood chips, and various supernatural events attributed to him—have been questioned by rationalist scholars who view such hagiographic accounts as legendary embellishments rather than historical facts.[^50] These skeptics argue that the veneration of Sunan Kalijaga and pilgrimages to his tomb border on saint worship that contradicts Islamic principles of worshipping God alone.[^51]

## Personal Life

Sunan Kalijaga married three wives during his lifetime: Dewi Sarah (also called Dewi Sarokah), Siti Zaenab, and Siti Hafsah (also written as Siti Khafsah).[^52] Siti Hafsah was the daughter of Sunan Ampel, another prominent member of the Wali Songo, indicating the interconnected family networks among the nine saints.[^53] According to some sources, Dewi Sarah was the daughter of Sunan Gunung Jati, further cementing familial ties among the Wali Songo leadership.[^54]

From his marriages, Sunan Kalijaga fathered numerous children who continued his religious and cultural legacy. From his marriage to Dewi Sarah, he had three children: Raden Umar Said (who became Sunan Muria, himself one of the Wali Songo), Dewi Rukayah, and Dewi Sofiah.[^55] Sunan Muria (d. 1551) established his own missionary center on Mount Muria in northern Central Java and is remembered for his emphasis on social justice and serving the poor.[^56] From his marriage to Siti Zaenab, Sunan Kalijaga had five children: Ratu Pembayun, Nyai Ageng Panegak, Sunan Hadi, Raden Abdurrahman, and Nyai Ageng Ngerang.[^57] After Sunan Kalijaga's death, his son Sunan Hadi became the leader of the Islamic community in Kadilangu, continuing his father's missionary work.[^58]

Historical accounts describe Sunan Kalijaga as living to approximately 100 years of age, suggesting remarkable longevity for the period.[^59] Traditional sources indicate he lived through four different royal governments, experiencing the final decline of Majapahit, the rise of the Demak Sultanate, and the subsequent political transformations of 16th-century Java.[^60] He was a close friend and collaborator of Sunan Gunung Jati, with whom he worked on various architectural and missionary projects, particularly in the Cirebon region.[^61]

Sunan Kalijaga's personality, as depicted in traditional narratives and folktales, combined deep humility with creative brilliance. His transformation from a highwayman to a saint reflects themes of redemption and spiritual rehabilitation that resonate with Islamic concepts of tawbah (repentance) and divine mercy.[^62] Unlike some religious teachers who maintained austere separation from common people, Sunan Kalijaga engaged directly with popular culture, attending and performing at entertainment events, markets, and communal gatherings where ordinary Javanese people spent their time.[^63] This approachability and willingness to meet people where they were—both physically and culturally—distinguished his missionary style from more elite, scripture-focused approaches.

His philosophical teachings, preserved in Javanese wisdom sayings, reveal his ethical framework. Famous maxims attributed to him include "Urip Iku Urup" (Life is a flame—meaning life should illuminate and benefit others), "Memayu Hayuning Bawana" (Humans must strive for safety, happiness, and prosperity in the world while eradicating anger, greed, and desire), and "Ngluruk Tanpo Bolo, Menang Tanpo Ngasorake, Sekti Tanpo Aji-Aji, Sugih Tanpo Bondo" (Struggle without bringing masses, win without humiliating, have authority without relying on force, be rich without material possessions).[^64] These teachings emphasize inner spiritual development, ethical conduct, and service to others over external displays of power or wealth, reflecting Sufi influences on his thought.[^65]

## Legacy

Sunan Kalijaga's legacy represents one of the most enduring influences on Indonesian Islamic culture, having established a model of religious practice that successfully synthesized Islamic monotheism with Javanese cultural identity.[^66] His approach to Islamic propagation—emphasizing cultural adaptation, artistic expression, and gradual transformation rather than confrontational replacement of existing traditions—created a distinctively Javanese form of Islam that has persisted for over five centuries.[^67] The wayang kulit performances and gamelan music that he transformed into vehicles for Islamic teaching remain central to Javanese cultural life, with many contemporary performances still incorporating the Islamic themes and characters he introduced.[^68]

The tomb of Sunan Kalijaga in Kadilangu Village, located about 2 kilometers southeast of Demak City in Central Java, has become one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Indonesia.[^69] Thousands of pilgrims from across the Indonesian archipelago visit annually, particularly during Thursday nights and Fridays of Kliwon (according to the Javanese calendar) when the tomb's inner sanctum is opened to visitors.[^70] The peak pilgrimage season occurs in the month of Syafar, one month before Ramadan, and during special commemorative events including the Penjamasan (ritual cleansing) of Sunan Kalijaga's heirlooms, the Ancakan procession before Eid al-Adha, and ruwatan purification ceremonies.[^71] The pilgrimage complex includes three gates that visitors must pass through before reaching the Kasunanan Building where Sunan Kalijaga and his family are buried.[^72] Pilgrims often use water from ancient jars at the site for purification or take it home as a blessing, reflecting the continuing belief in the spiritual power associated with the saint.[^73]

Every year, the community in Kadilangu commemorates Sunan Kalijaga's haul (death anniversary) on 12 Muharram in the Islamic calendar, an event that attracts massive crowds and provides significant economic benefits to local small and medium enterprises, from food vendors to souvenir craftsmen.[^74] In contemporary Indonesia, Sunan Kalijaga's legacy is actively invoked in debates about religious tolerance, cultural preservation, and national unity amid religious diversity.[^75] Proponents of moderate Islam cite his example as a model for how Islamic values can be communicated respectfully within diverse cultural contexts without destroying local heritage, making his approach particularly relevant to Indonesia's pluralistic society with over 300 ethnic groups.[^76]

The institutional legacy of Sunan Kalijaga includes Sunan Kalijaga State Islamic University (UIN Sunan Kalijaga) in Yogyakarta, one of Indonesia's most prestigious Islamic higher education institutions, which was named in his honor to reflect values of scholarly excellence combined with cultural sensitivity.[^77] Academic research on his methods continues at Indonesian universities, exploring how his principles of "following yet influencing" might inform contemporary approaches to interfaith dialogue, cultural preservation, and peaceful religious transformation.[^78]

His philosophical teachings and Javanese wisdom sayings remain widely quoted in Indonesian discourse on ethics, spirituality, and social responsibility. Concepts like "Urip Iku Urup" (life should illuminate others) have been adopted by Indonesian educational institutions, civil society organizations, and political movements as principles for community service and ethical leadership.[^79] The festivals he established—Sekaten and Grebeg Maulud—continue to be celebrated in Yogyakarta, Surakarta (Solo), and other Javanese cities, now recognized as important cultural heritage events that attract domestic and international tourists while maintaining their religious significance.[^80]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars of Indonesian Islamic history overwhelmingly praise Sunan Kalijaga as a genius of cultural adaptation whose methods prevented the violent conflicts that often accompanied religious conversions elsewhere in the world.[^81] Academic researchers highlight how his "following yet influencing" principle demonstrated sophisticated understanding of social psychology and gradual behavior change, anticipating modern theories of cultural transformation.[^82] Dr. F.P. Meachem's study "Sunan Kalijaga: The Birth of a Self-Actualized Pilgrimage Culture" argues that his approach created a self-sustaining religious culture where Islamic practices became deeply embedded in Javanese identity rather than imposed as foreign requirements.[^83]

Historians emphasize that Sunan Kalijaga's use of wayang and gamelan represented innovative pedagogical techniques that made abstract theological concepts accessible to illiterate populations through visual storytelling and musical performance.[^84] Research published in the Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies demonstrates how his mystic philosophy built peace by emphasizing spiritual development (makrifat) and universal ethical values over sectarian doctrinal disputes.[^85] His choice to use Javanese and Sanskrit terminology rather than Arabic made Islamic concepts immediately comprehensible to people steeped in Hindu-Buddhist civilization, reducing the psychological barrier to conversion.[^86]

Supporters of Sunan Kalijaga's legacy point out that his syncretic approach succeeded where more rigid approaches failed—Java became majority Muslim while maintaining cultural continuity with its past, avoiding the wholesale destruction of cultural heritage that occurred in some other Islamic expansion contexts.[^87] Contemporary scholars of religious tolerance cite his example as demonstrating that religious conviction and cultural flexibility are not mutually exclusive, and that successful missionary work requires respect for existing cultural systems.[^88] Academic articles in *HTS Teologiese Studies* and other theological journals analyze how his emphasis on Islamic patriotism combined with humanitarian values created a form of Islam focused on rahmatan lil alamin (mercy for all worlds) rather than conquest or domination.[^89]

Defenders also argue that accusations of superficial conversion misunderstand the nature of religious transformation—Sunan Kalijaga recognized that genuine faith develops gradually through practice and community participation rather than instantaneous ideological conversion.[^90] His patient, multi-generational approach allowed Islamic values to permeate Javanese society organically, resulting in a durable Islamic identity that has withstood five centuries of political and social change.[^91]

### Negative Views

Critics, particularly from reformist and modernist Islamic movements, argue that Sunan Kalijaga's accommodationist approach compromised essential Islamic principles and created a heterodox variant of Islam that incorporated un-Islamic elements.[^92] Scholars influenced by Salafi and Wahhabi perspectives contend that his tolerance of pre-Islamic Javanese practices resulted in widespread shirk (polytheism) and bid'ah (innovation) that persist in contemporary Javanese Muslim communities.[^93] They point to practices like slametan offerings, veneration of sacred sites and objects, belief in spirits and ancestors, and syncretic rituals as evidence that Kalijaga's methods failed to establish orthodox Islamic understanding.[^94]

Reformist critics argue that true Islamic propagation requires clear explanation of tawhid (pure monotheism), rejection of all forms of polytheistic practice, and adherence to the Quran and authentic hadith as the sole sources of religious authority.[^95] From this perspective, Sunan Kalijaga's use of wayang puppetry and gamelan music—forms associated with Hindu-Buddhist mythology and potentially prohibited as image-making and musical distraction from worship—represents an inappropriate compromise with pre-Islamic culture.[^96] Some contemporary Indonesian Islamic organizations, particularly those affiliated with Muhammadiyah and other modernist movements, have worked to "purify" Javanese Islam by eliminating practices they trace to Sunan Kalijaga's syncretic approach.[^97]

Academic critics have also questioned the historical reliability of traditional narratives about Sunan Kalijaga, noting that most accounts were compiled centuries after his death and contain legendary elements that cannot be verified through contemporaneous sources.[^98] Historians point out significant uncertainty about basic biographical facts including his exact birth and death dates, the details of his conversion, and the specific contributions attributed to him.[^99] Some scholars argue that "Sunan Kalijaga" may represent a composite figure or that various achievements attributed to him were actually accomplished by multiple people whose stories became conflated in later hagiographic traditions.[^100]

Secularist scholars have critiqued the veneration of Sunan Kalijaga and pilgrimages to his tomb as promoting superstitious beliefs incompatible with both orthodox Islam and modern rational thought.[^101] They argue that attributing miraculous powers to saints and treating their tombs as sources of blessing represents a regression to pre-Islamic animistic beliefs repackaged in Islamic terminology.[^102] From this perspective, the Sunan Kalijaga cult reflects the failure of Islamic education in Indonesia to develop critical thinking and theological literacy among believers.[^103]
