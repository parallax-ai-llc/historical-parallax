## Summary

In January 2001, the Philippines demonstrated that people power could work twice. Just fifteen years after the original EDSA Revolution had toppled Ferdinand Marcos, Filipinos returned to the same streets to remove another president. Joseph Estrada—a former movie star turned populist politician—faced impeachment for corruption. When senators voted to suppress damaging evidence, hundreds of thousands took to the EDSA Shrine. Four days later, the military withdrew support, and Estrada was out.[^1]

EDSA II was faster than the original—four days instead of four—and its target was less brutal than Marcos. But it raised uncomfortable questions about Philippine democracy. Estrada had been elected by the largest vote margin in history. Was removing him through street protest democratic, or was it a kind of civilian coup? The poor who had voted for Estrada saw their champion toppled by Manila's middle class. The revolution had succeeded, but at what cost to electoral legitimacy?[^2]

Vice President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo took power, later winning her own election. Estrada was arrested, tried, convicted of plunder—then pardoned by Arroyo. He later ran for president again and became mayor of Manila. Philippine politics had returned to normal. But the precedent was set: when institutions failed, the streets could still decide.[^3]

## Historical Assessment

### What Made EDSA II Work?

**Similar to 1986:**

- Mass mobilization
- Church support
- Military defection
- Unified opposition

**Differences:**

- Faster (4 days vs. 4)
- Target was democratically elected
- Elite-driven more than 1986
- Technology (text messaging)

### The "Constitutional Coup" Question

**Some observers called it:**

- Constitutional because Supreme Court validated
- Coup because military defection was decisive
- Civilian coup because people power was used
- Democratic because mass participation

**No consensus on classification.**

### Long-Term Impact

**For democracy:**

- Extra-constitutional removal normalized?
- Or accountability mechanism?
- Debates continue

**For Estrada:**

- Ran for president again (2010): Lost
- Won as Manila mayor (2013-2019)
- Survived and returned

**For Arroyo:**

- Served until 2010
- Later charged with corruption (irony)
- Also survived and returned (became House Speaker)[^11]

## Legacy

### For the Philippines

- "People Power" remains a reference point
- But questions about its use
- Electoral politics continue to be contested
- Duterte (2016) showed populism's resilience

### Comparison: EDSA I vs. EDSA II

| Feature       | EDSA I (1986)       | EDSA II (2001)     |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Duration      | 4 days              | 4 days             |
| Target        | Marcos (dictator)   | Estrada (elected)  |
| Trigger       | Fraudulent election | Corruption scandal |
| Key defection | Military            | Military           |
| Successor     | Aquino (opposition) | Arroyo (VP)        |
| Death toll    | Minimal             | None               |
| Legitimacy    | Broadly accepted    | Contested          |

### The Lesson

**People power is powerful but ambiguous:**

- Can remove tyrants
- Can also remove elected leaders
- Depends on who mobilizes
- And who defines legitimacy[^12]
