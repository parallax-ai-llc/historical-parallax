## Summary

The Attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941. The attack, which came without a declaration of war, killed 2,403 Americans, wounded 1,178, sank or damaged 19 U.S. Navy ships (including 8 battleships), and destroyed 188 aircraft. Japan's objectives were to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet to prevent interference with Japanese military actions in Southeast Asia and to demoralize American willingness to fight. The attack achieved tactical surprise but failed strategically: U.S. aircraft carriers were at sea and survived, and the attack unified American public opinion, leading President Franklin D. Roosevelt to declare it "a date which will live in infamy." The United States declared war on Japan the next day, entering World War II.

## Background

**Rising Tensions:**
- U.S.-Japan relations deteriorated over Japan's invasion of China (1937) and expansion into French Indochina (1940)
- U.S. imposed economic sanctions, including oil embargo (July 1941)—Japan imported 80% of its oil from U.S.
- Japan faced choice: abandon expansion or seize oil-rich Dutch East Indies
- War seemed inevitable

**Japanese Strategy:**
- Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto planned preemptive strike to cripple U.S. Pacific Fleet
- Believed surprise attack could buy time for Japan to consolidate Pacific conquests
- Yamamoto reportedly warned: "I can run wild for six months... after that, I have no expectation of success"

## The Attack

**Dawn Raid (December 7, 1941):**
- **First Wave (7:48 AM)**: 183 aircraft (fighters, bombers, torpedo planes)
- **Second Wave (8:54 AM)**: 171 aircraft
- Total: 353 Japanese aircraft from 6 aircraft carriers

**Targets:**
- Battleship Row (8 battleships moored along Ford Island)
- Airfields (Hickam, Wheeler, Bellows, Kaneohe, Ewa)
- Dry docks, fuel storage (largely missed)

**Devastation:**
- **USS Arizona**: Exploded, sank, 1,177 killed (nearly half of total deaths)
- **USS Oklahoma**: Capsized, 429 killed
- Other battleships: **California**, **West Virginia**, **Nevada**, **Tennessee**, **Maryland**, **Pennsylvania** damaged or sunk
- 188 aircraft destroyed, 159 damaged
- 2,403 killed, 1,178 wounded

**Japanese Losses:**
- 29 aircraft
- 5 midget submarines
- 64 servicemen killed

**Critical Failures (Japanese Perspective):**
- U.S. aircraft carriers (**Enterprise**, **Lexington**, **Saratoga**) were at sea—escaped destruction
- Fuel storage tanks, dry docks, repair facilities survived
- Did not launch third wave (would have targeted infrastructure)

## Aftermath

**"A Date Which Will Live in Infamy":**
December 8, 1941, President Roosevelt addressed Congress:
> "Yesterday, December 7th, 1941—a date which will live in infamy—the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan."

Congress declared war on Japan with only one dissenting vote (Rep. Jeannette Rankin, pacifist).

**U.S. Entry into WWII:**
- Germany and Italy declared war on U.S. (December 11)
- United States fully committed to Allied cause
- Transformed WWII into truly global conflict

**Public Reaction:**
- Shock, outrage, unity
- Isolationism evaporated overnight
- "Remember Pearl Harbor!" became rallying cry
- Massive military mobilization began

**Long-Term Consequences:**
- Revealed vulnerability of battleships to air power
- Aircraft carriers became dominant naval weapon
- U.S. industrial might mobilized—produced ships, aircraft, weapons at unprecedented scale
- Japan's short-term success doomed by long-term strategic failure

## Controversy

**Advance Knowledge Debate:**
Some conspiracy theories claim Roosevelt knew of attack in advance to justify entering war. Historians overwhelmingly reject this:
- U.S. had broken some Japanese codes but not all
- Warnings were vague, conflicting
- Military commanders in Hawaii received warnings but didn't act decisively
- More likely: intelligence failures, communication breakdowns, complacency

**Investigation:**
- Roberts Commission (1942) blamed commanders Kimmel and Short
- Later investigations exonerated them partially, citing systemic failures

## Legacy

**Memorial:**
USS Arizona Memorial built over sunken battleship (1962)—visited by millions annually. Ship remains submerged tomb for 900+ sailors.

**Lessons:**
- Importance of intelligence
- Danger of complacency
- Need for military readiness
- Consequences of surprise attack

**Historical Significance:**
Pearl Harbor marked U.S. transformation into global superpower, end of isolationism, and turning point of WWII.
