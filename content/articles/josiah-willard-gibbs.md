## Summary

Josiah Willard Gibbs was an American physicist, mathematician, and chemist whose work on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics was foundational. He developed the concepts of Gibbs free energy, chemical potential, and the phase rule. His work on vector analysis and statistical mechanics profoundly influenced physics and chemistry. Einstein called him the greatest American scientist of his era.
