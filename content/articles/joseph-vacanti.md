## Summary

Joseph Vacanti, with Robert Langer, co-founded the field of tissue engineering. He pioneered the concept of growing human tissues on biodegradable scaffolds for transplantation. His famous 'Vacanti mouse' with a human ear-shaped scaffold on its back (1997) became an iconic image of tissue engineering, though widely misunderstood by the public.
