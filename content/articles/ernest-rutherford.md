## Summary

Ernest Rutherford was a New Zealand-born British physicist who is regarded as the father of nuclear physics. He discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, differentiated alpha and beta radiation, and proposed the nuclear model of the atom. He received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1908 for his investigations into the disintegration of elements. His gold foil experiment fundamentally changed our understanding of atomic structure.
