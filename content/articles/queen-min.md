## Summary

Empress Myeongseong (1851-1895), known during her lifetime as Queen Min, was the official wife of King Gojong, the 26th king of Joseon and the first emperor of the Korean Empire.[^1] A politically astute and intelligent leader, she emerged from humble beginnings as an orphaned aristocrat to become the de facto ruler of Korea during the turbulent late 19th century.[^2] From 1873 to her assassination in 1895, she pursued ambitious modernization programs and skillfully navigated foreign policy among competing powers including Japan, China, and Russia.[^3] Her brutal assassination by Japanese agents in 1895 sparked international outrage and cemented her status as a controversial yet pivotal figure in Korean history.[^4] Today she is remembered both as a national heroine who fought to preserve Korean independence and as a divisive leader whose nepotistic practices and political maneuvering drew criticism.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Born on November 17, 1851, in Seomrak Village, Geundong-myeon, Yeoheung (now Yeoju), Gyeonggi Province, the future Empress Myeongseong came into the world as Min Ja-yeong, daughter of the aristocratic Yeoheung Min clan.[^6] The Yeoheung Min clan boasted an illustrious past with many high-ranking bureaucrats, princess consorts, and two previous queen consorts: Queen Wongyeong, wife of Taejong of Joseon and mother of Sejong the Great, and Queen Inhyeon, second wife of Sukjong of Joseon.[^7] Her father, Min Chi-rok, who was later known as Internal Prince Yeoseong, was a government official who studied under scholar Oh Hui-sang and eventually married the scholar's daughter as his first wife.[^8] After three years of mourning, Min Chi-rok married Lady Yi of the Hansan Yi clan, later known as Internal Princess Consort Hanchang, in 1836.[^9] The future empress was the fourth and only surviving child of Lady Yi.[^10]

Tragedy struck early in Min Ja-yeong's life when at age seven, she lost her father to illness on September 17, 1858, while he was in Sado city.[^11] Her mother passed away when she was just nine years old, leaving her a poor orphan.[^12] For the next eight years, Lady Min was raised by her mother and Min relatives until her life would change dramatically with her selection as queen.[^13] Despite her circumstances, her aristocratic background and clan connections would prove instrumental in her eventual selection as the bride for the young king. In 1866, she was chosen by the de facto Regent Heungseon Daewongun to marry his son, King Gojong.[^14] The Daewongun wrongfully anticipated she would remain a docile figure indulgent to his own political ambitions, a calculation that would prove spectacularly incorrect.[^15]

On March 21, 1866, Min Ja-yeong married King Gojong of Korea, becoming Queen of Korea at the age of fourteen.[^16] The marriage initially proved difficult, as King Gojong neglected his young bride for his concubines.[^17] She spent her lonely nights productively, however, reading extensively in subjects normally reserved for yangban men: history, philosophy, religion, and politics.[^18] The queen, genuinely concerned with affairs of state, immersed herself in these scholarly pursuits while her husband enjoyed spending his days and nights drinking and attending banquets.[^19] King Gojong eventually recognized Queen Min's extraordinary intelligence and wit, developing an admiration for her ability to learn quickly.[^20] Over time, their relationship transformed from neglect to partnership, with King Gojong growing to love his wife deeply during Korea's modernization years.[^21]

## Rise to Power

The political struggle between Queen Min and her father-in-law, the Heungseon Daewongun, became increasingly intense in the years following her marriage. Seven years after becoming queen, she and her Min clan successfully forced the powerful regent out of office in 1873.[^22] The conflict became public when her infant son died just four days after birth. The Heungseon Daewongun publicly accused her of being unable to bear a healthy male child, while she suspected her father-in-law of foul play through the ginseng emetic treatment he had brought her.[^23] This tragedy catalyzed her political mobilization. The queen consort secretly formed a powerful faction against the Daewongun, gathering backing from high officials, scholars, and members of her clan with the goal of removing him from power.[^24]

Min Seung-ho, the queen consort's adoptive older brother, along with court scholar Choe Ik-hyeon, devised a formal impeachment of the Daewongun.[^25] The impeachment was presented to the Royal Council of Administration, arguing that the 22-year-old King Gojong should now rule in his own right rather than remain under his father's regency.[^26] In 1873, with the approval of both Gojong and the Royal Council, the Heungseon Daewongun was forced to retire to Unhyeongung, his estate at Yangju.[^27] After this expulsion and those of other rivals, the queen consort gained control over the court, where her own clan family members received high office.[^28] She wielded political power through the numerous Mins who owed their positions to her patronage.[^29]

After reaching adulthood and consolidating power, the seemingly submissive queen started to show her extraordinary ambition and political skills, becoming the de facto ruler of Korea.[^30] With the support of her husband, King Gojong, she established many progressive reforms across multiple sectors including economy, transportation, agriculture, education, and medicine.[^31] From the 1870s onwards, Queen Min became increasingly dominant and pursued a policy of cautious modernization and opening up, in stark contrast to her father-in-law's conservative isolationist stance.[^32] Her political acumen allowed her to gain complete control of the Joseon government, placing her family members in high positions and exercising significant influence over key decisions.[^33] Contemporary observers noted that her personal speaking voice was soft and warm, but when conducting affairs of state, she asserted her points with strength, adhering heavily to court etiquette and traditional law while demonstrating formidable political capability.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Empress Myeongseong's tenure as the power behind the throne was marked by ambitious modernization initiatives across multiple sectors of Korean society. From 1873 to her assassination in 1895, she oversaw sweeping economic, military, and governmental modernization programs designed to strengthen Korea against foreign encroachment.[^35] Her approach represented a significant departure from the isolationist policies of the Heungseon Daewongun, embracing instead a strategy of gradual modernization using Western and Chinese assistance.[^36] Isabella Bird Bishop, a British traveler who observed the empress, described her as "clever and educated," with contemporaries noting she possessed "force, intellect and strength of character."[^37]

In the realm of education, Queen Min made groundbreaking contributions to women's advancement in Korea. She gave her patronage to Ewha Academy, the first all-girls' educational institution in Korea, established in Seoul between 1885 and 1886 by American Methodist missionary Mary F. Scranton.[^38] The name "Ewha" was graciously bestowed by Queen Min herself.[^39] This academy marked the first time in Korean history that all girls, whether commoner or aristocratic, had the right to an education, representing a revolutionary social change.[^40] The institution eventually became Ewha Womans University, one of Asia's earliest institutions dedicated to women's higher education, producing many notable firsts including South Korea's first female prime minister, first female doctor, and first female lawyer and judge.[^41]

Military reforms constituted another major pillar of her modernization program. In 1881, Queen Min began implementing military reforms based on the Japanese military system, inviting Japanese military attaché Lieutenant Horimoto Reizō to serve as an adviser in creating a modern army.[^42] However, these reforms angered many traditional military officials who opposed the new system, ultimately contributing to the military rebellion of 1882 supported by the Heungseon Daewongun.[^43] Despite this setback, her commitment to military modernization reflected her understanding that Korea needed contemporary armed forces to survive in an era of imperial competition.

Economic modernization represented another significant area of achievement. Queen Min played a pivotal role in steering Joseon Korea toward economic opening after 1873, prioritizing trade diversification to bolster national sovereignty.[^44] Her faction advocated replacing Korea's traditional seclusion with selective engagement, viewing commerce as a means to acquire technology and generate revenue for the state.[^45] A project called "American Farm" was started on land donated by the Queen to promote modern agriculture, with farm tools, seeds, and dairy cows imported from the United States.[^46] She also made advancements in the press, medicine, religion, music, and the economy, all aimed at modernizing and strengthening Korea against foreign threats.[^47]

Her diplomatic achievements were equally impressive. Skilled in foreign affairs and diplomacy, she set in motion an ambitious plan to navigate Korea through the treacherous waters of great power competition.[^48] During her tenure, she strove to keep Korea politically and diplomatically independent of foreign influence, negotiating skillfully with neighboring powers including the Russian Empire, Qing Dynasty China, and Japan.[^49] When Japan won the First Sino-Japanese War, the Empress pivoted Korea toward closer relations with Russia to counterbalance Japan's growing power, demonstrating sophisticated strategic thinking.[^50] William Franklin Sands, a United States diplomat, described her as "a politician and diplomat who overtaken the times, striving for the independence of Joseon, possessing outstanding academics, strong intellectual personality, and unbending willpower."[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her modernization efforts, Empress Myeongseong's reign was plagued by serious controversies, particularly regarding nepotism and the corrupt practices of the Min clan. She concentrated on having members of the Min family appointed to key financial, personnel, and military positions within the Korean government, and the Mins came to occupy critical positions in the central administration.[^52] After the expulsion of her rivals, the queen consort exercised control over the court by placing her own clan family members in high office, creating a system where numerous Mins owed their positions directly to her patronage.[^53] The rule of the Mins proved to be arrogant, inefficient, and corrupt, with the Yeoheung Min clan causing such extreme public trouble that it made people nostalgic even for the previous regimes of the Andong Kim clan and the Pungyang Jo clan.[^54] The Min clan became symbols of corrupt officialdom in the public imagination.[^55]

Since it was a time of concentrated political power in Min hands, the relatives of the queen naturally became targets of criticism, and in anecdotes that recorded contemporary rumors, they were portrayed as the root of all societal evils.[^56] With King Gojong largely uninterested in the day-to-day management of politics, Min was happy to work overtime to keep her country in check, but her behind-the-scenes wheeling and dealing proved highly controversial among both traditional elites and common people.[^57] Court officials noted that the queen consort was exclusive in choosing who she associated with and confided in, creating an insular power structure that bred resentment.[^58]

Her military modernization policies also sparked significant opposition and violence. In one infamous controversial move, she asked Korea's technologically advanced neighbor Japan to train her new military units in a bid to modernize the country, which did not go down well given Korea's already strained relationship with Japan.[^59] The resentment toward the new special force on the part of soldiers of the regular army, who were envious of the better-equipped and better-treated modern units, contributed directly to the Imo Incident of 1882.[^60] More than 1,000 soldiers had been discharged in the process of overhauling the army, with the rest not having been given their pay in rice for 13 months, a situation that triggered a violent uprising.[^61] The rebel army killed many key figures in the Min clan's regime and Japanese advisers to the new army, and even attempted to murder Queen Min herself, forcing her to escape the Royal Palace by disguising herself as a lady of the court.[^62]

The broader historical assessment reveals deep divisions in how she is perceived. Queen Min is one of the most controversial figures in Korean history, with some viewing her as a charismatic politician and diplomat who tried to lead the country into a new era, while others deem her a manipulative, power-seeking woman.[^63] Some older Koreans who survived the Japanese occupation criticize her for failing to resist the Japanese militarily, arguing that her diplomatic approach ultimately failed to prevent colonization.[^64] The peasant army during the Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894 had explicit aims of overthrowing the rule of Queen Min and her clique and expelling the Japanese, demonstrating widespread dissatisfaction with the corruption and policies of her government.[^65] Critics point out that while she sought to modernize Korea, the nepotistic practices and ineffective governance of the Min clan may have actually weakened the state at a critical juncture.

## Personal Life

Empress Myeongseong's personal life was marked by both intellectual fulfillment and profound tragedy. Her marriage to King Gojong began inauspiciously, with the young king initially neglecting his bride in favor of his concubines.[^66] During this difficult period, she preferred to stay in her chambers studying while her husband enjoyed spending his days and nights drinking and attending banquets.[^67] However, as Gojong grew to recognize his wife's intelligence, wit, and ability to learn quickly, their relationship deepened into genuine partnership and love.[^68] It is believed that Gojong fell deeply in love with his wife during the years of Korea's modernization, coming to rely heavily on her political judgment and strategic thinking.[^69]

The couple faced heartbreaking challenges in producing an heir. Her first four children died shortly after birth, bringing immense personal grief and political vulnerability.[^70] Their children with Empress Myeongseong included: Prince Royal Yi Choi (born November 4, 1871, died November 8, 1871), their second son who lived only four days; a second daughter (born February 3, 1873, died September 28, 1873); Yi Cheok (born March 25, 1874, died April 24, 1926), their third son who would become Emperor Sunjong; Yi Deol (born April 5, 1875, died April 18, 1875), their fourth son who survived only thirteen days; and Yi Bu (born February 18, 1878, died June 5, 1878), their sixth son who lived less than four months.[^71] Yi Cheok, also known as Emperor Sunjong, was their only child to survive to adulthood and would later become the last emperor of Korea, serving as a living link to his mother's legacy.[^72]

Contemporary observers provided vivid descriptions of Empress Myeongseong's personality and demeanor. Detailed descriptions from Korean records and Lillias Underwood, an American missionary who served as her doctor, described her as "having a soft face with strong features" and noted that "her voice was soft, but she spoke with strength when dealing with state affairs."[^73] Isabella Bird Bishop emphasized the "force, intellect and strength of character in that face."[^74] Court officials observed that the empress was exclusive in choosing who she associated with and confided in, maintaining a formal public manner while adhering heavily to court etiquette and traditional law.[^75] She was said to be very intelligent, with her extraordinary political skills and intelligence allowing her to emerge from her initially submissive role to become the de facto ruler of Korea.[^76]

Her intellectual life remained central to her identity throughout her time as empress. The Empress once remarked about her husband King Gojong during the difficult early years: "He disgusts me," a comment revealing the initial gulf between the studious queen and her pleasure-seeking husband.[^77] She genuinely concerned herself with the affairs of state, immersing herself in philosophy, history, and science books normally reserved for yangban men, developing the knowledge base that would later enable her sophisticated political maneuvering.[^78] As was customary in late Joseon society, the woman who came to be Empress Myeongseong never had a personal name recognized in official records, and "in Western terms, she was nameless throughout her life," known only by titles and clan affiliation.[^79] This erasure of her personal identity stands in stark contrast to her enormous political influence and the indelible mark she left on Korean history.

## Legacy

Empress Myeongseong's brutal assassination on October 8, 1895, transformed her from a controversial political figure into a powerful symbol of Korean resistance against Japanese imperialism. Her death inspired the people of the Korean Empire to resist Japanese imperialism and fight for independence, with her legacy continuing to live on through Korean dramas, musicals, movies, fashion, and more.[^80] In October 1897, King Gojong proclaimed the founding of the Korean Empire and raised the status of his deceased wife to Empress, forever enshrining her elevated status.[^81] The formal process involved several steps: on January 6, 1897, Gojong changed the queen consort's posthumous name to "Queen Munseong," which officials noted was too similar to King Jeongjo's temple name; on March 2, 1897, he changed the name to "Myeongseong"; and when Gojong became Emperor Gwangmu on October 13, 1897, her title was elevated to "Empress Myeongseong," with the addition of "Tae" (meaning Great) to her posthumous title.[^82]

The creation of a gold seal in 1897 engraved with "Hwanghujibo" (Seal of the Empress) symbolized the posthumous entitlement of Queen Consort Myeongseong to Empress Consort as King Gojong ascended the throne as emperor, cementing her place in Korean imperial history.[^83] Her funeral location was altered to Hongneung, creating a site that would become a place of historical pilgrimage and national memory.[^84] Many in South Korea, influenced by a recent novel, television drama, and musical, view her as a national heroine for striving diplomatically and politically to keep Korea independent of foreign influence during one of the nation's most perilous periods.[^85]

Modern cultural representations have played an enormous role in shaping contemporary perceptions of Empress Myeongseong. In Korean culture, she has been portrayed as a symbol of national resistance against Japanese encroachment, appearing in historical dramas and films that emphasize her modernization efforts and tragic end.[^86] The 2001 television drama "Empress Myeongseong" and various theatrical productions have introduced her story to new generations, often presenting her in heroic terms as a visionary leader who fought impossible odds.[^87] She has been regarded as a national heroine and celebrated for her reforms and attempts to maintain Korean independence in an era of aggressive imperial expansion by surrounding powers.[^88]

However, her legacy remains contested and complex. Some Koreans celebrate other historical women more than Myeongseong, and some were taught in high school that she was an ambitious and manipulative ruler who inadvertently allowed the Japanese to gain influence in the first place.[^89] The Japanese portrayal of Empress Myeongseong forms part of recent controversies over allegations of revisionist history in Japanese school textbooks, with debates continuing over how her resistance to Japanese influence should be characterized.[^90] Empress Myeongseong or Queen Min was probably the most influential Korean woman in the modern history of the country, and as first empress of the Korean Empire, she established her influence on politics early and was a decisive force trying to check Japan's imperial ambitions on the Korean Peninsula.[^91] The scholarly consensus increasingly recognizes her as a significant political figure who attempted to navigate Korea through a turbulent period of foreign encroachment while pursuing modernization, even as debates continue about the effectiveness and consequences of her strategies.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholars who view Empress Myeongseong positively emphasize her extraordinary political acumen, patriotic dedication to Korean independence, and pioneering modernization efforts during an impossibly difficult period. Empress Myeongseong has often been praised for her "wisdom and insight" and for being a talented and accomplished politician who demonstrated sophisticated understanding of international relations.[^93] William Franklin Sands, the United States diplomat who observed her governance, described her as "a politician and diplomat who overtaken the times, striving for the independence of Joseon, possessing outstanding academics, strong intellectual personality, and unbending willpower," a characterization that highlights her intellectual capabilities and fierce determination.[^94]

Many in South Korea view her as a national heroine for striving diplomatically and politically to keep Korea independent of foreign influence, particularly given the limited options available to a small nation caught between aggressive imperial powers.[^95] Skilled in foreign affairs and diplomacy, she set in motion an ambitious plan to modernize Korea, demonstrating strategic vision in sectors including education, military organization, economic development, and international relations.[^96] Her support for Ewha Academy represented groundbreaking advancement for women's rights and education, marking the first time all Korean girls, whether commoner or aristocratic, had access to formal schooling.[^97] Isabella Bird Bishop's observation that she possessed "force, intellect and strength of character" captures the admiration many contemporaries felt for her capabilities.[^98]

Defenders argue that her alliance-building with Russia and China represented sophisticated balance-of-power diplomacy aimed at preserving Korean sovereignty against Japanese expansionism. She showed great skill in managing foreign affairs when she solicited the help of Russia and China's Qing dynasty to prevent the Japanese from taking over Korea, which was clearly feasible within Japan's imperialist ambitions.[^99] From this perspective, her assassination by Japanese agents in 1895 proved the Japanese government viewed her as a genuine obstacle to their colonial ambitions, validating her effectiveness as a defender of Korean independence.[^100] Her legacy continues to inspire, with her death inspiring the people of the Korean Empire to resist Japanese imperialism and fight for independence.[^101]

### Negative Views

Critics of Empress Myeongseong focus on her nepotistic practices, the corruption of the Min clan regime, her alleged political manipulation, and ultimately her failure to prevent Japanese colonization. The rule of the Mins proved to be arrogant, inefficient, and corrupt, with the Yeoheung Min clan causing such extreme public trouble that they became symbols of corrupt officials in the popular imagination.[^102] She concentrated power by having members of the Min family appointed to key financial, personnel, and military positions of the Korean government, creating a system where loyalty to the clan trumped merit and competence.[^103] The relatives of the queen naturally became targets of criticism, portrayed in contemporary anecdotes as the root of societal evils.[^104]

Some older Koreans who survived the Japanese occupation criticize her for failing to resist the Japanese militarily, arguing that her diplomatic maneuvering ultimately proved ineffective and may have even facilitated Japanese penetration of Korean institutions.[^105] The peasant army during the Donghak Peasant Revolution of 1894 had explicit aims of overthrowing the rule of Queen Min and her clique and expelling the Japanese, demonstrating widespread popular dissatisfaction with both her governance and her policy of selective engagement with foreign powers.[^106] Critics point to the Imo Incident of 1882, triggered partly by resentment toward her military reforms and the neglect of traditional soldiers who went unpaid for over a year, as evidence of her disconnect from the needs of ordinary Koreans.[^107]

Her controversial decision to invite Japanese military advisers to modernize Korea's army is seen by some as a catastrophic misjudgment that gave Japan dangerous influence within Korean institutions.[^108] Some Koreans were taught in school that she was an ambitious and manipulative ruler who inadvertently allowed the Japanese to gain their initial foothold, with her factional politics and clan favoritism weakening the Korean state at precisely the moment it needed unity and strength.[^109] Queen Min is one of the most controversial figures in Korean history, with substantial numbers viewing her not as a heroic reformer but as a self-interested power-seeker whose nepotism and political machinations contributed to Korea's vulnerability.[^110] From this critical perspective, while her intentions may have included modernization and independence, her methods—characterized by favoritism, corruption, and factional conflict—ultimately undermined Korean sovereignty and paved the way for the very colonization she sought to prevent.

## Famous Quotes

> "He disgusts me." - Queen Min's comment about her husband King Gojong during the difficult early years of their marriage, reflecting the initial gulf between the studious queen and her pleasure-seeking husband.[^111]

While direct quotes from Empress Myeongseong are scarce in historical records, contemporary observers left powerful characterizations of her words and presence:

> "Her voice was soft, but she spoke with strength when dealing with state affairs." - Description from Korean historical records and Lillias Underwood, an American missionary and her doctor, capturing the contrast between her gentle personal manner and her forceful political presence.[^112]

> "A politician and diplomat who overtaken the times, striving for the independence of Joseon, possessing outstanding academics, strong intellectual personality, and unbending willpower." - William Franklin Sands, United States diplomat, providing perhaps the most comprehensive contemporary assessment of her character and capabilities.[^113]

> "Clever and educated... force, intellect and strength of character in that face." - Isabella Bird Bishop, British traveler, describing her observations of the Empress and the impression she conveyed.[^114]

The scarcity of direct quotations from Empress Myeongseong herself reflects both the limited preservation of her exact words in historical records and the cultural customs of late Joseon society, where she remained "nameless throughout her life" in Western terms, known only through titles and clan affiliation rather than as an individual voice.[^115]
