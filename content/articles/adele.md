## Early Life and Background

Adele Laurie Blue Adkins was born on May 5, 1988, in Tottenham, London, to an English mother, Penny Adkins, and a Welsh father, Marc Evans.[^6] Her parents met at The King's Head pub in North London in the summer of 1987 in what Evans later described as "love at first sight."[^7] Penny was a former art student who became unexpectedly pregnant with Adele at age 18, prompting her to abandon her college dreams to focus on raising her daughter.[^8] Soon after Adele's birth, the young family moved into a two-bedroom flat in Tottenham, where Marc worked as a plumber while Penny concentrated on motherhood.[^9]

When Adele was just two years old, her father left the family, leaving Penny to raise Adele as a single mother.[^10] Throughout Adele's childhood, Penny took on various jobs to make ends meet, including positions as a furniture maker, masseuse, and adult-learning activities organizer.[^11] Despite the financial challenges, Adele formed an extraordinarily close bond with her mother, later calling Penny her "best friend."[^12] The two lived together in a flat in London's West Norwood until Adele was 18.[^13]

In 1997, when Adele was nine years old, she and her mother relocated to Brighton on the south coast of England.[^14] Two years later, in 1999, they returned to London, first settling in Brixton before moving to the neighboring district of West Norwood in south London.[^15] From an early age, Adele showed a passion for music, beginning to sing at age four and developing what she described as an obsession with voices.[^16] She enjoyed singing contemporary pop music and taught herself to play guitar and clarinet during her childhood.[^17]

It was during her early teens that Adele's musical trajectory began to crystallize. At age 14, she discovered rhythm-and-blues legends Etta James and Ella Fitzgerald by accident when she stumbled upon their CDs in the jazz section of her local music store, captivated by their appearance on the album covers.[^18] Etta James, in particular, had a profound impact on the young Adele. She found James's music in the bargain bin of a record store and later recalled, "She was the first time a voice made me stop what I was doing and sit down and listen."[^19] Adele began listening to Etta James every night for an hour, a practice that helped her "get to know my own voice."[^20] She has stated that she taught herself how to sing "by listening to Ella Fitzgerald for acrobatics and scales, Etta James for passion and Roberta Flack for control."[^21]

At age 14, Adele successfully auditioned for the BRIT School for Performing Arts & Technology in Croydon, a government-funded secondary school that also educated artists such as Amy Winehouse, Leona Lewis, and Jessie J.[^22] At the BRIT School, Adele studied various aspects of music, from vocal techniques to songwriting, with the curriculum focusing on practical experience that allowed her to collaborate with other aspiring musicians and gain valuable performance experience.[^23] Adele graduated from the BRIT School in May 2006.[^24] Her mother also introduced her to contemporary R&B and soul artists, turning her on to Mary J. Blige, Lauryn Hill, and Alicia Keys—she calls Lauryn Hill's *The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill* and Alicia Keys's *Songs in A Minor* "life-defining."[^25]

## Rise to Power

Adele's rise to fame began with a serendipitous discovery facilitated by social media. While at the BRIT School, she recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend.[^26] That friend posted the demo on Myspace in 2006, where it became extraordinarily successful, amassing over 10,000 plays and catching the attention of music industry executives.[^27] Among those who took notice was Richard Russell, director of the independent record label XL Recordings.[^28] The three-track demo, which included her future song "Hometown Glory," showcased Adele's powerful voice and songwriting talent.[^29]

Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management, and in June 2006, Dickins became her official representative.[^30] That September, Huggett signed Adele to XL Recordings.[^31] Just four months after graduating from the BRIT School in November 2006, the 18-year-old Adele had secured a record deal.[^32] The discovery felt almost too good to be true—Adele later admitted she doubted if the offer was real and brought a friend to the meeting for reassurance.[^33]

Adele's debut album, *19* (named after her age when she created it), was released in 2008 and immediately garnered critical attention.[^34] The album featured the singles "Chasing Pavements" and "Hometown Glory," which showcased her soulful voice and mature songwriting capabilities far beyond her years.[^35] At the 51st Grammy Awards in 2009, Adele won her first two Grammy Awards: Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for "Chasing Pavements."[^36] These early accolades positioned her as a rising star in the music industry with tremendous potential.

However, it was her second studio album, *21*, released on January 24, 2011, that catapulted Adele to global superstardom.[^37] Inspired by a turbulent romantic relationship, *21* featured emotionally raw and universally relatable songs about heartbreak and resilience.[^38] The album spawned multiple chart-topping singles, including "Rolling in the Deep," "Someone Like You," and "Set Fire to the Rain," all of which headed charts worldwide and became her signature songs.[^39] "Rolling in the Deep" reached number two in the UK and became her first number one on the US Billboard Hot 100, while "Someone Like You" peaked at number one in both the UK and Ireland and became her second US number-one single.[^40]

The commercial and critical success of *21* was unprecedented. The album topped the Billboard 200 for 24 weeks, holding the record for the top-performing album in US chart history at the time.[^41] With sales of over 31 million copies worldwide, *21* became the best-selling album of the 21st century.[^42] At the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, Adele won in all six categories for which she was nominated, including Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year—making her the second female artist in Grammy history, after Beyoncé, to win that many awards in a single night.[^43] Billboard credited Adele for reviving the music industry in 2011, calling her "a unique presence not only in 2011, but in all of the 21st-century pop."[^44]

## Major Achievements

Adele's career is marked by a series of monumental achievements that have solidified her status as one of the most successful and influential artists of her generation. Her accolades include 16 Grammy Awards, 12 Brit Awards (including three for British Album of the Year), an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe Award, making her one Tony Award away from achieving EGOT status.[^45]

Following the historic success of *21*, Adele continued to dominate the music industry with subsequent releases. Her third studio album, *25*, released on November 20, 2015, broke numerous records immediately upon release.[^46] The lead single "Hello" debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Adele's fourth number-one single in the US and breaking several records, including becoming the first song with over a million digital sales in a week.[^47] The album itself achieved the highest single-week sales in US history with 3.38 million copies sold in its first week.[^48] In the UK, *25* had the biggest-selling Number 1 album of all time, shifting 800,307 copies in its first week.[^49]

Unlike her previous releases, Adele initially withheld *25* from streaming services to boost sales—a strategy that proved enormously successful.[^50] The album became the best-selling album worldwide in 2015.[^51] At the 59th Grammy Awards in 2017, Adele again swept the top three categories (Album of the Year, Record of the Year, and Song of the Year), becoming the first artist in Grammy history to win all three major categories twice.[^52]

In 2012, Adele achieved another career milestone when she was commissioned to write and perform the theme song for the James Bond film *Skyfall*.[^53] Co-written with producer Paul Epworth, "Skyfall" became the first James Bond theme to win an Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 85th Academy Awards in February 2013.[^54] Adele performed the song live for the first time at the ceremony, delivering a memorable performance before learning she had won.[^55] The song also earned Adele a Golden Globe Award, a Brit Award for British Single, a Critics' Choice Movie Award, and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[^56] With sales of 7.2 million copies worldwide, "Skyfall" became one of the best-selling digital singles of all time.[^57]

Adele's fourth studio album, *30*, released on November 19, 2021, continued her commercial dominance.[^58] Unlike *25*, *30* was made available on streaming services from day one, reflecting the changing landscape of music consumption.[^59] The album became the best-selling album of 2021 worldwide with 5.54 million copies sold and also achieved the distinction of being the best-selling vinyl album of 2021 during its fourth week of release.[^60] During its release week, the album's lead single "Easy On Me" broke streaming records.[^61]

Between November 2022 and November 2024, Adele performed a highly successful Las Vegas residency titled "Weekends with Adele" at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace.[^62] Originally scheduled to begin in January 2022, the residency was postponed one day before opening due to COVID-19 affecting half her team and production delays.[^63] When rescheduled in July 2022, the show was expanded from 24 to 32 shows, and tickets sold out within six hours, resulting in an average gross of $2.2 million per show.[^64] The residency was extended multiple times due to popular demand and concluded after 100 total performances.[^65]

In August 2024, Adele performed an exclusive 10-date concert residency in Munich, Germany, her only European mainland shows of the year.[^66] Performed in a specially constructed pop-up stadium at the Munich Trade Fair with capacity for 80,000 people per night, the residency attracted more than 730,000 attendees total and generated an estimated 540 million euros in indirect economic impact for the Bavarian capital.[^67] The Munich performances recorded the highest attendance for any concert residency outside Las Vegas over 10 consecutive dates.[^68]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her overwhelmingly positive public image, Adele has faced several controversies throughout her career that have sparked debate and criticism. In August 2020, Adele posted a photograph on social media wearing a Jamaican-themed bikini top and Bantu knots—a traditional African hairstyle—to celebrate the canceled Notting Hill Carnival.[^69] The post drew accusations of cultural appropriation from some critics who felt she was inappropriately adopting elements of Black culture.[^70] Others defended Adele, arguing that she was honoring Caribbean culture in a celebratory context.[^71] Adele later reflected on the incident, acknowledging "I didn't read the fucking room" and joking that "I was wearing a hairstyle that is actually to protect Afro hair. Ruined mine, obviously."[^72]

In February 2022, at the Brit Awards ceremony that had recently eliminated gendered categories in favor of gender-neutral awards, Adele's acceptance speech sparked controversy when she said, "I understand why the name of this award has changed but I really love being a woman and being a female artist."[^73] Some interpreted her comments as insensitive or transphobic, though widespread criticism was difficult to find on social media, with most discourse focusing on whether the controversy itself was manufactured or overblown.[^74]

Adele's dramatic weight loss in 2019, during which she lost approximately 100 pounds, generated significant public discussion and criticism.[^75] While Adele stated that her workout regimen was designed to help manage anxiety rather than to lose weight, the transformation sparked intense debate, particularly among women.[^76] Adele expressed disappointment with the discourse, stating, "The most brutal conversations were being had by other women about my body. I was very fucking disappointed with that. That hurt my feelings."[^77]

In 2024, Adele faced backlash from Korean fans when imagery featuring the Rising Sun flag appeared on LED screens during her Munich concert.[^78] The flag has deeply negative connotations for Koreans due to its association with Japanese militarism and wartime atrocities.[^79] The incident highlighted the challenges artists face when performing for international audiences with different historical sensitivities.

Adele has also faced plagiarism allegations on multiple occasions. Critics have pointed to similarities between her song "Million Years Ago" and Kurdish singer Ahmet Kaya's "Acilara Tutunmak," as well as between "Hello" and Tom Waits's "Martha."[^80] While no legal action resulted from these accusations, they reflect ongoing scrutiny of her songwriting.

Additionally, Adele has been candid about her struggles with vocal health. In 2011, she suffered a vocal cord hemorrhage that forced her to cancel multiple tour dates throughout the year.[^81] She described feeling a "ripping" sensation in her throat during a performance, comparing the injury to "a black eye on her vocal cord."[^82] In October 2011, when her throat problems resumed, doctors discovered a polyp that required surgical removal.[^83] Adele underwent vocal cord microsurgery by Dr. Steven Zeitels at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston to stop recurrent vocal cord hemorrhage.[^84] Some vocal experts have noted that Adele uses "improper, damaging technique to achieve the resonance of her upper belts," which has contributed to her vocal difficulties.[^85] Her chest-dominant mixed register and tension have been identified as areas of technical weakness that make it difficult to consistently replicate results live.[^86]

## Personal Life

Adele's personal life has been shaped by close family relationships, struggles with mental health, and high-profile romantic relationships that have often inspired her music. She maintains an extraordinarily close bond with her mother, Penny Adkins, whom she credits with supporting her musical aspirations and introducing her to influential R&B and soul artists.[^87] Adele lived with her mother until age 18 and has consistently described Penny as her "best friend."[^88]

Adele's relationship with her father, Marc Evans, was far more complicated. After Evans left the family when Adele was two, she had minimal contact with him for most of her life.[^89] In interviews, she expressed anger and disappointment over his absence, particularly his struggles with alcoholism.[^90] However, in the years before his death in 2021, Adele reconciled with her father, a process she described as deeply emotional and healing.[^91]

On October 19, 2012, Adele gave birth to her son, Angelo Adkins, with her then-partner Simon Konecki, a British charity entrepreneur known for his work as CEO of Drop4Drop, a non-profit providing clean drinking water to developing countries.[^92] Adele began dating Konecki in 2011.[^93] The arrival of Angelo fundamentally altered Adele's perspective on life and her career. She stated, "I felt like I was truly living. I had a purpose, where before I didn't. He makes me so proud of myself, and he makes me like myself so much."[^94]

Despite her global fame, Adele has been fiercely protective of Angelo's privacy. In 2013, Adele and Konecki brought a privacy case against a UK-based photo agency that published intrusive paparazzi images of their son during family outings, and lawyers accepted damages from the company in July 2014.[^95] Adele's lawyer stated that she insisted Angelo never become "public property."[^96] When Angelo was three years old, Adele told *Time* magazine, "I don't want him being one of those who grows up being like, 'Driver, driver!' I really don't want him growing up like that. I'm very conscious of it."[^97]

Motherhood prompted Adele to prioritize family over the demanding schedules of touring and recording, leading to a more balanced lifestyle.[^98] She famously took a significant break after the success of *21* to focus on raising Angelo, a deliberate choice to be present during his formative years.[^99] Songs like "Sweetest Devotion" and "My Little Love" are heartfelt tributes to her son, with "My Little Love" from *30* including vulnerable voice notes of conversations with Angelo as she navigated her divorce.[^100]

Adele confirmed in 2021 that she and Konecki officially married in 2018, though she had publicly announced they were married as early as 2017.[^101] However, 2018 was also the year the couple decided to separate, and Adele filed for divorce in 2019, which was finalized in 2021.[^102] Adele has been remarkably open about why the marriage ended, telling *Vogue*, "I was just going through the motions and I wasn't happy. Neither of us did anything wrong. Neither of us hurt each other or anything like that. It was just: I want my son to see me really love, and be loved."[^103]

Despite their divorce, Adele and Konecki maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship. Adele expanded her property portfolio by purchasing a $10 million home across the street from her Los Angeles residence, where Konecki now lives.[^104] She told *Vogue*, "I'd trust him with my life. I definitely chose the perfect person to have my child with. That—after making a lot of knee-jerk reactions—is one of my proudest things I've ever done."[^105]

In 2021, Adele began a relationship with Rich Paul, a prominent NBA sports agent who founded Klutch Sports Group and represents major basketball stars including LeBron James.[^106] The couple confirmed their engagement in August 2024.[^107] During her Las Vegas residency, Adele referred to Paul as her husband, though no official wedding announcement has been made public as of early 2025.[^108] The relationship appears strong, with sources describing it as "solid" and noting that "they help each other and are good partners."[^109] Adele has expressed her desire to have children with Paul and refers to his daughter as her stepdaughter.[^110]

Adele has been candid about her mental health struggles, particularly her experience with postpartum depression following Angelo's birth. She described suffering from "really bad postpartum depression" that was "frightening," making her feel "very inadequate" and like she'd "made the worst decision of my life."[^111] Initially reluctant to seek help, she eventually confided in a friend who shared similar feelings, which helped her recovery.[^112] Seeking professional help through therapy played a crucial role in addressing her mental health challenges.[^113] As recently as 2022, she opened up to fans during a performance about continuing therapy after her divorce triggered a depressive episode.[^114]

Adele has also struggled with severe stage fright throughout her career, which earlier in her career caused her to "projectile vomit."[^115] Despite conquering her onstage anxiety enough to schedule sold-out tours, she has stated, "I'd still like to make records, but I'd be fine if I never heard [the applause] again."[^116] Adele's openness about her mental health struggles has helped reduce stigma and has resonated deeply with fans facing similar challenges.[^117]

Regarding her personality, Adele describes herself as having a "big personality," saying, "I walk into a room, big and tall and loud."[^118] She has also stated, "I have insecurities of course, but I don't hang out with anyone who points them out to me."[^119]

## Legacy

Adele's impact on the music industry and popular culture is profound and multifaceted, establishing her as one of the defining artists of the 21st century. With sales of over 120 million records worldwide, she was named the best-selling artist of the 2010s in the United States.[^120] Her influence extends far beyond commercial success, fundamentally shaping contemporary pop music and cultural attitudes toward authenticity, body image, and emotional vulnerability.

Billboard credited Adele for reviving the music industry in 2011 and heralding "a new era of relatable pop" due to the critical and commercial success of *21*.[^121] Her success shattered records and set new standards for album sales and concert attendance, demonstrating that in an increasingly fragmented and streaming-dominated market, exceptional artistry could still achieve massive mainstream success.[^122] By withholding *25* from streaming services initially, she proved that traditional album sales remained viable in the digital age, a strategy that influenced how other major artists approached releases.[^123]

Adele's cultural significance was recognized early in her career. In 2014, she was already regarded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among people they most associated with UK culture, alongside William Shakespeare and The Beatles.[^124] A 2021 article noted that "a new Adele album isn't just a release − it's a global cultural event."[^125] Her ability to bridge generational gaps through timeless music that transcends age barriers is among her most notable contributions.[^126]

One of Adele's most significant legacies is her representation of authenticity in an industry often criticized for superficiality.[^127] She has consistently remained relatable, down-to-earth, and maintained a level of privacy and self-respect rarely seen in contemporary pop culture.[^128] Adele has demonstrated that artists don't have to conform to industry standards or compromise their artistic vision to achieve success, empowering countless musicians to stay true to their unique voices.[^129]

Adele has been credited for reviving the breakup ballad in pop music, paving the way for young artists like Olivia Rodrigo to incorporate similar emotionally raw elements into their work.[^130] Her mezzo-soprano vocals, described as raspy and expressive, have set a standard for vocal performance in popular music.[^131] Inarguably regarded as the greatest vocalist of her generation, Adele instinctively understands timbre and pitch with unmatched skill.[^132]

Beyond music, Adele has played a significant role in promoting body positivity and self-acceptance. She has spoken openly about her struggles with body image and advocated for self-love, famously stating, "I've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines. I represent the majority of women, and I'm very proud of that."[^133] She has also said, "I don't find thin girls attractive; be happy and healthy. I've never had a problem with the way I look. I'd rather have lunch with my friends than go to a gym."[^134] Her willingness to discuss postpartum depression, stage fright, and mental health challenges has helped reduce stigma and inspired individuals facing similar struggles.[^135]

Adele's philanthropic efforts further cement her legacy. She actively supports charities including Amnesty International, Keep A Child Alive, Sands, and Drop4Drop.[^136] During her 2011 world tour, she required complimentary ticket holders to donate to Sands, raising $13,000 for the organization that supports parents who lose children.[^137] In 2017, she founded the "Adele Laurie Blue Adkins Foundation" in partnership with MusiCares to help children in need worldwide.[^138] Her response to the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire in London was particularly notable—she visited survivors, brought cakes to firefighters, treated affected children to a movie screening, and became actively involved with Grenfell United, an organization advocating for safe housing.[^139]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Music critics, scholars, and industry professionals have consistently praised Adele as one of the most exceptional artists of her generation. The critical reception for *21* was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers describing it as "timeless" and noting that the simple instrumentation and structures allowed Adele's "raspy, expressive voice to develop the story in the verses before she delivers the hook."[^140] The album has been compared to Amy Winehouse's *Back to Black* as "a major leap forward that instantly sounds like a classic."[^141]

Reviewing *30*, critics called it "certainly her strongest album yet, a work of catharsis, therapy and succour" that "does what pop music is greatest at: gathering up emotions, focusing them and pouring them out to songs that everybody can sing, but few can sing quite as well as Adele."[^142] *Rolling Stone* noted that "Adele has never sounded more ferocious than she does on 30—more alive to her own feelings, more virtuosic at shaping them into songs."[^143]

Adele's vocal abilities have received particular acclaim. She is classified as a lyric mezzo-soprano with a vocal range spanning approximately three octaves (C3 to E5 to C6).[^144] Vocal analysts have praised her "womanly" and "lachrymose" qualities, noting her remarkable ability to manipulate vocal color and timbre.[^145] As a trained blues singer, she lavishes phrases with small ornamentations including grace notes, trills, growls, and imperceptible flips from chest to head voice, drawing listeners in before pushing her voice for power in the chorus.[^146]

Scholars of popular music have noted Adele's significance in revitalizing emotional authenticity in pop. Her success has shown that vulnerability and genuine emotion resonate with global audiences in ways that heavily produced, image-focused pop often cannot. Billboard's assertion that she represents "a unique presence not only in 2011, but in all of the 21st-century pop" reflects widespread recognition of her singular impact.[^147]

Adele's influence extends to empowering other artists. By achieving unprecedented success while maintaining creative control and refusing to conform to industry expectations about appearance and behavior, she has demonstrated alternative pathways to stardom. Her advocacy for body positivity and mental health awareness has been particularly praised for helping shift cultural conversations around these issues.[^148]

### Negative Views

Despite overwhelming praise, Adele has faced criticism from some quarters regarding technical vocal limitations and artistic consistency. Vocal coaches and critics have noted that she uses "improper, damaging technique to achieve the resonance of her upper belts," with her mixed register identified as her weakest due to chest-dominant mixing and tension.[^149] Critics argue that using a more balanced or head-dominant mix would allow her to sing higher with greater comfort and longevity.[^150] The vocal hemorrhages and polyp that required surgery in 2011 have been cited as evidence of these technical issues.[^151]

Some critics have characterized Adele as "almost the zeitgeist of the modern pop vocalist: one with some technical training, but values individuality and musical expression over technical perfection, which causes difficulty in consistently replicating results live."[^152] This assessment suggests that while her emotional expressiveness is undeniable, her technical approach may limit her ability to maintain consistent vocal quality throughout demanding performance schedules.

Reviews of *25* were more mixed than those of her previous albums. While acknowledging her vocal prowess, some critics felt the album lacked the innovation and raw emotional power of *21*. One review noted that "all 11 songs are of a piece—they're shaded by melancholy, gaining most of their power through performance," suggesting a formulaic approach that relied heavily on Adele's delivery rather than compositional variety.[^153]

The plagiarism controversies, particularly regarding "Million Years Ago" and its similarity to Ahmet Kaya's "Acilara Tutunmak," have led some to question the originality of her songwriting.[^154] While no legal action resulted, the allegations reflect concerns about whether some of her most celebrated melodies may draw too heavily from existing works.

Critics have also pointed to instances where Adele's comments or actions have been perceived as culturally insensitive, such as the Bantu knots controversy and the use of Rising Sun flag imagery at her Munich concert.[^155] While these incidents did not fundamentally damage her reputation, they highlight moments when her cultural awareness appeared to fall short of the careful sensitivity expected of global superstars.

Some observers have noted that Adele's extended breaks between albums and reluctance to tour extensively suggest a complicated relationship with fame that may limit her long-term impact. Her own statements about preferring to never hear applause again and being "really frightened" of fame indicate that the demands of global superstardom may not be sustainable for her psychologically.[^156]
