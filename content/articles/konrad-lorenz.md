## Summary

Konrad Lorenz was an Austrian zoologist and ethologist who shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discoveries about animal behavior patterns. He is considered one of the founders of modern ethology (the study of animal behavior). He discovered the principle of imprinting, in which young animals form attachments during a critical period. His popular books brought ethology to a wide audience.
