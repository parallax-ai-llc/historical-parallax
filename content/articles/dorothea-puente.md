## Summary
Dorothea Puente ran a Sacramento boarding house where she murdered elderly and disabled tenants to collect their Social Security checks. At least nine people were killed between 1982 and 1988. Convicted of three murders, she maintained a grandmotherly image while burying victims in her yard.

## Early Life
Born January 9, 1929, in Redlands, California. Orphaned as a child, raised in foster homes. She had a history of fraud convictions. She gained a reputation as a kind caretaker for the elderly and disabled. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Puente operated a boarding house at 1426 F Street in Sacramento, administering drugs to elderly tenants, killing them, and collecting their government checks. She buried victims in her yard. Visitors noted strong smells but attributed them to other causes. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
In November 1988, a social worker reported a missing tenant. Excavation revealed seven bodies. During the dig, Puente asked police to get coffee — she fled to LA and was caught days later. Convicted of three murders in 1993. Died in prison March 27, 2011. [^3]
