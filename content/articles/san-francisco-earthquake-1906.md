## Overview

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake was one of the deadliest natural disasters in American history. On April 18, 1906, at 5:12 AM, a massive earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.9 struck along the San Andreas Fault. The ground shaking lasted only about 45-60 seconds, but the fires that followed burned for three days, destroying over 80% of San Francisco. At least 3,000 people died (official count: 700, widely considered undercount), 225,000+ were left homeless, and 28,000 buildings were destroyed. The disaster reshaped urban planning, building codes, and earthquake science worldwide.

## The Earthquake

### April 18, 1906

**Time:** 5:12 AM local time
**Magnitude:** 7.9 (estimated; Richter scale not invented yet)
**Epicenter:** Near San Francisco, along 296 miles of San Andreas Fault
**Duration:** 45-60 seconds of intense shaking

### Impact

**Ground Rupture:**
San Andreas Fault ruptured from San Juan Bautista to Cape Mendocino. Maximum horizontal displacement: 20+ feet.

**Building Collapse:**
Victorian wood-frame houses collapsed. Brick and masonry structures fared worst.

**Casualties from Quake:**
Hundreds killed instantly—crushed, trapped.

---

## The Fire

### More Destructive Than Earthquake

**Cause:**
- Gas mains ruptured
- Coal stoves overturned
- Electrical shorts
- (Arson by property owners seeking insurance)

**Spread:**
Multiple fires merged into firestorm over three days.

### Fighting the Fire

**Water System Destroyed:**
Earthquake broke water mains. Fire hydrants useless.

**Dynamiting:**
Fire Chief Dennis Sullivan mortally wounded early. Army and firefighters dynamited buildings to create firebreaks—often spread fire instead.

**"Ham and Eggs Fire":**
One woman, trying to cook breakfast, started major blaze.

### Burned Area

**4.7 Square Miles:**
Over 500 city blocks destroyed.
- Chinatown obliterated
- Financial district destroyed
- Residential neighborhoods devastated

---

## Human Toll

### Deaths

**Official Count:** 700
**Revised Estimates:** 3,000+ (based on later research)

**Undercount Reasons:**
- Chinese deaths often not recorded
- Many bodies cremated in fires, never counted
- Political desire to minimize disaster

### Homeless

**225,000-300,000:**
Over half of San Francisco's 400,000 residents lost homes.

### Refugees

**Camps:**
Thousands lived in tent cities in parks (Golden Gate Park, Presidio) for months and years.

**Displacement:**
Many never returned. Some relocated to Oakland, Los Angeles.

---

## Martial Law

### Military Control

**General Frederick Funston:**
Declared martial law (without authorization). Army patrolled streets.

**Shoot-to-Kill Orders:**
Looters to be shot on sight. Numerous summary executions reported.

**Evacuation:**
Hundreds of thousands evacuated by ferry to Oakland.

### Duration

Martial law lasted over two months.

---

## Response and Recovery

### Relief Efforts

**National and International Aid:**
$9+ million in relief (over $300 million today). Aid from across U.S. and world.

**Red Cross:**
Major role in disaster relief—established model for future disasters.

### Rebuilding

**Rapid Reconstruction:**
City rebuilt within 10 years. Population recovered by 1910.

**Cover-Up:**
Officials minimized earthquake damage, emphasized fire ("fire-proof" buildings). Feared investors would flee earthquake zone.

---

## Scientific Impact

### Understanding Earthquakes

**Harry Fielding Reid:**
Studied fault. Developed "elastic rebound theory" of earthquake generation.

**G.K. Gilbert:**
Documented fault rupture scientifically.

### Seismology

Established San Francisco region as earthquake-prone. Foundation for earthquake science, building codes.

---

## Significant Events

### Death of Fire Chief

**Dennis Sullivan:**
San Francisco's fire chief, the one man who might have organized effective firefighting, was mortally wounded when a hotel collapsed onto his quarters at 5:12 AM. Died days later.

### Opera Star Enrico Caruso

Performing at San Francisco Opera. Escaped quake, vowed never to return. (He never did.)

### Burning of Chinatown

**Entire Neighborhood Destroyed:**
27,000 Chinese residents displaced. City leaders tried to relocate Chinatown permanently—residents resisted.

---

## Long-Term Consequences

### Building Codes

California became leader in earthquake-resistant construction. (Ironically, initially resisted, then mandated.)

### Urban Planning

- Better water supply systems
- Wider streets as firebreaks
- Insurance reform

### San Andreas Fault

Recognized as major hazard. Continual study. "Big One" expected.

## Notable Survivors

- **Arnold Genthe:** Photographer, documented disaster
- **Jack London:** Writer, covered fires
- **Enrico Caruso:** Opera singer

## Famous Quote

> "At 5:16 a.m. came the earthquake. A minute later the flames were leaping upward... Within an hour I must have run a dozen blocks." — Jack London
