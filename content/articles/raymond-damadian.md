## Summary

Raymond Damadian pioneered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), proposing in 1971 that nuclear magnetic resonance could distinguish between normal and cancerous tissues. He built the first full-body MRI scanner (Indomitable) in 1977 and produced the first human MRI scan. He was controversially excluded from the 2003 Nobel Prize given for MRI development.
