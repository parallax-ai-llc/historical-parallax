## Summary

Sanford 'Sandy' Weill built Citigroup into the world's largest financial services company through a series of transformative mergers. His 1998 merger of Travelers Group with Citicorp created the first American financial supermarket. He successfully lobbied for the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act to make the merger legal. His legacy is debated, as the financial supermarket model he championed contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.
