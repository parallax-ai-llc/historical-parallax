## Summary

Zhu Yigui (朱一貴, 1690-1722) was a Chinese-born rebel leader who orchestrated one of the most significant uprisings against Qing Dynasty rule in Taiwan during the early 18th century. Known as the "Duck King" (鴨母王) due to his occupation as a duck farmer before his rebellion, Zhu led a massive insurrection in 1721 that briefly established an independent regime in Taiwan[^1]. His rebellion, which lasted approximately two months, captured the island's capital and declared the restoration of the Ming Dynasty, attracting tens of thousands of followers from Taiwan's Han Chinese immigrant population[^2]. Though ultimately crushed by Qing forces, Zhu's uprising remains a pivotal event in Taiwanese history, symbolizing early resistance to mainland Chinese control and foreshadowing centuries of political tension across the Taiwan Strait[^3].

---

## Early Life and Background

Zhu Yigui was born around 1690 in Zhangzhou Prefecture, Fujian Province, on mainland China, during the early years of the Qing Dynasty's consolidation of power[^4]. Like many impoverished southern Chinese of his era, Zhu emigrated to Taiwan seeking economic opportunities in the relatively frontier territory that had only recently come under Qing administration following the defeat of the Ming loyalist Zheng family regime in 1683[^5]. Historical records describe Zhu as coming from humble origins, with little formal education but possessing charismatic leadership qualities and a natural ability to connect with common people[^6].

After crossing the Taiwan Strait, Zhu settled in the Luohanmen area of present-day Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan, where he made his living as a duck farmer—a common occupation among immigrants in Taiwan's rural areas[^7]. This occupation would later earn him the moniker "Duck King," both as a term of endearment among his followers and mockery from his enemies[^8]. Taiwan in the early 18th century was a volatile frontier society, populated primarily by recent Han Chinese immigrants from Fujian and Guangdong provinces who often clashed with indigenous populations and competed among themselves along ethnic and clan lines[^9].

The social conditions that shaped Zhu's worldview were characterized by ethnic tensions, heavy taxation, corrupt local officials, and the Qing government's restrictive policies toward Taiwan, which was viewed as a remote and potentially rebellious territory[^10]. The Qing authorities implemented discriminatory policies, including restrictions on family migration that created a heavily male immigrant population prone to violence and instability[^11]. Many Taiwanese residents harbored nostalgia for the Ming Dynasty, which had fallen to the Qing in 1644, and some maintained Ming loyalist sentiments, particularly among those connected to the Zheng family's former regime[^12].

---

## Rise to Power

Zhu Yigui's transformation from obscure duck farmer to rebel leader began in early 1721, catalyzed by a combination of economic hardship, ethnic conflict, and political grievances against Qing rule[^13]. The immediate trigger for the rebellion was a violent incident in April 1721 involving conflict between different ethnic groups of Han Chinese settlers—specifically between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou natives—and deteriorating relations with local Qing officials who were perceived as corrupt and oppressive[^14].

According to contemporary accounts, Zhu began organizing secret meetings with discontented farmers, laborers, and others who suffered under Qing taxation and administrative abuses[^15]. He skillfully exploited widespread Ming loyalist sentiments, claiming descent from the Ming imperial family and promising to restore the fallen dynasty—a powerful rallying cry that resonated deeply with many Han Chinese in Taiwan who viewed the Qing as foreign Manchu oppressors[^16]. While Zhu's actual connection to Ming royalty was almost certainly fabricated, such claims were common among rebel leaders of the period and proved effective in mobilizing support[^17].

The rebellion erupted on May 1, 1721, when Zhu and his followers launched coordinated attacks against Qing military installations and government offices across southern Taiwan[^18]. The insurgents achieved stunning initial success, quickly overwhelming the undermanned and unprepared Qing garrison forces. Within weeks, Zhu's army had grown from hundreds to tens of thousands of fighters, as frustrated immigrants, aboriginal allies, and opportunists joined what appeared to be a winning cause[^19]. The rebels employed guerrilla tactics, intimate knowledge of local terrain, and the element of surprise to devastating effect against the better-equipped but poorly led Qing forces[^20].

By late May 1721, Zhu's forces had captured Taiwan's capital, Taiwan-fu (present-day Tainan), representing the complete collapse of Qing authority on the island[^21]. Zhu proclaimed himself the "Zhongxing King" (中興王, meaning "King of Restoration"), established a government structure modeled on Ming Dynasty institutions, and began issuing edicts and appointing officials[^22]. His court adopted Ming-era clothing, hairstyles (rejecting the Qing-imposed queue), and ceremonial practices, symbolically rejecting Qing legitimacy[^23].

## Major Achievements

Despite the brief duration of his regime, Zhu Yigui accomplished several significant objectives that demonstrated both his leadership capabilities and the depth of anti-Qing sentiment in early 18th-century Taiwan[^24]. His primary achievement was the complete, albeit temporary, overthrow of Qing Dynasty control over Taiwan—a remarkable feat considering the resources and geographical advantages available to the imperial government[^25].

Zhu demonstrated considerable organizational ability in rapidly assembling and coordinating a multi-ethnic coalition that included not only Han Chinese from various regional backgrounds but also indigenous Taiwanese peoples who had their own grievances against Qing policies[^26]. His ability to unite these diverse and often mutually antagonistic groups, even temporarily, showed sophisticated political and diplomatic skills uncommon among peasant rebels of the period[^27]. The rebellion's early military successes against Qing forces revealed competent tactical leadership and effective exploitation of local knowledge and terrain advantages[^28].

Under Zhu's brief rule, he attempted to establish functioning governmental institutions, including a rudimentary taxation system, military command structure, and administrative apparatus for the territories under his control[^29]. While these institutions remained underdeveloped due to the short duration of his regime, they demonstrated ambitions beyond mere banditry or temporary uprising—Zhu envisioned creating a sustainable alternative government[^30]. He issued proclamations emphasizing justice, reduction of corrupt practices that had characterized Qing administration, and restoration of Ming values and governance[^31].

Zhu's rebellion also succeeded in exposing the fundamental weaknesses of Qing control over Taiwan, including insufficient military garrisoning, poor quality of local officials, and the fragility of Qing legitimacy among the predominantly Han Chinese immigrant population[^32]. The uprising forced the Qing court to fundamentally reassess its Taiwan policies, leading to subsequent administrative reforms, increased military presence, and somewhat more careful governance—changes that might not have occurred without the shock of Zhu's rebellion[^33].

The scale of popular support Zhu attracted demonstrated his charismatic leadership and ability to articulate the grievances of common people[^34]. Contemporary accounts, even those hostile to the rebellion, acknowledged that Zhu attracted followers through persuasion rather than mere coercion, and that he maintained a degree of popular legitimacy during his brief rule[^35]. His use of Ming restorationist ideology proved remarkably effective in mobilizing mass support, revealing the continued potency of dynastic legitimacy claims even decades after the Ming Dynasty's fall[^36].

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Zhu Yigui's rebellion and brief rule were marked by significant controversies and actions that drew criticism both from contemporary observers and later historians[^37]. The most serious charges against Zhu concern the extreme violence that characterized the rebellion, including massacres of Qing officials, soldiers, and civilians perceived as loyalists or collaborators[^38]. Historical records document numerous atrocities committed by rebel forces, including the killing of entire families of government officials and the destruction of property belonging to those associated with the Qing administration[^39].

The rebellion quickly devolved into ethnic violence between different groups of Han Chinese settlers, particularly between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou natives, undermining Zhu's claims to be leading a unified anti-Qing movement[^40]. These inter-communal conflicts, which Zhu proved unable or unwilling to control effectively, resulted in significant casualties and property destruction that had little connection to the stated anti-Qing objectives of the uprising[^41]. Critics argue that Zhu exploited rather than resolved these ethnic tensions for short-term military advantage, exacerbating social divisions that would plague Taiwan for generations[^42].

Zhu's claimed descent from the Ming imperial family was almost certainly fraudulent, representing a cynical manipulation of popular Ming loyalist sentiments rather than genuine ideological commitment[^43]. Historians have found no credible evidence supporting his royal lineage claims, suggesting that Zhu deliberately deceived his followers to enhance his legitimacy and authority[^44]. This deception raises questions about his true motivations—whether he was genuinely committed to Ming restoration or merely seeking personal power under convenient ideological cover[^45].

The governance Zhu established during his brief rule showed significant shortcomings, including arbitrary decision-making, inability to maintain discipline among his followers, and failure to develop sustainable administrative or economic policies[^46]. His government quickly degenerated into competing factions vying for power and resources, suggesting limited political sophistication beyond the initial act of rebellion[^47]. Some historians characterize Zhu's regime as little more than organized banditry dressed in Ming restorationist rhetoric[^48].

Zhu has been criticized for inadequate military preparation and strategic planning, particularly his failure to anticipate and prepare for the inevitable Qing counterattack[^49]. Despite controlling Taiwan for nearly two months, he made little effective use of this time to fortify positions, secure supplies, or develop defensive strategies, suggesting either overconfidence or fundamental military incompetence[^50]. His rapid defeat once Qing reinforcements arrived from the mainland demonstrated the superficiality of his military organization and the fragility of his support base[^51].

---

## Personal Life

Historical records provide limited but revealing details about Zhu Yigui's personal life and character[^52]. He was married and had a family, though specific details about his wife and children remain scarce in surviving documents[^53]. Some accounts suggest he had multiple children, though their ultimate fates after the rebellion's collapse are poorly documented, with some sources indicating they were executed along with Zhu while others suggest some family members escaped or were spared[^54].

Contemporary descriptions portray Zhu as physically imposing and charismatic, with natural leadership qualities that enabled him to command loyalty from diverse followers[^55]. He was reportedly a compelling public speaker who could inspire crowds with his rhetoric about Ming restoration and justice against Qing oppression[^56]. These charismatic qualities proved essential to his rapid rise from obscurity to leading tens of thousands in rebellion within weeks[^57].

Despite his humble origins and limited formal education, Zhu demonstrated practical intelligence and understanding of popular sentiments and grievances[^58]. He was described as having a common touch, able to relate to ordinary farmers, laborers, and soldiers—a quality that distinguished him from elite-born rebel leaders and contributed to his popular appeal[^59]. However, this same lack of education and elite connections may have limited his ability to develop sophisticated governance strategies or diplomatic initiatives[^60].

Accounts of Zhu's personality are contradictory, reflecting the biases of different sources[^61]. Qing official histories portray him as cruel, ambitious, and deceitful—a dangerous bandit who manipulated ignorant peasants for personal gain[^62]. Sympathetic accounts, including some folk traditions, depict him as a hero of the common people, driven by genuine grievances and commitment to justice rather than personal ambition[^63]. The historical truth likely lies between these extremes, with Zhu being a complex figure combining genuine grievances, personal ambition, charismatic leadership, and limited political sophistication[^64].

Zhu's background as a duck farmer became central to his public identity, both during and after his rebellion[^65]. While enemies used the "Duck King" moniker mockingly to emphasize his low status and supposed unfitness for leadership, supporters embraced it as evidence of his connection to common people and contrast with corrupt elite officials[^66]. This aspect of his identity highlighted the class dimensions of the rebellion and its appeal to Taiwan's immigrant laboring population[^67].

## Legacy

Zhu Yigui's rebellion, despite its brief duration and ultimate failure, left a lasting impact on Taiwan's history and Chinese political consciousness[^68]. The uprising demonstrated the fragility of Qing control over Taiwan and forced the imperial government to fundamentally reconsider its governance approach to the island, leading to increased military garrisoning, administrative reforms, and somewhat more cautious policies toward the local population[^69]. These changes shaped Taiwan's development for the remainder of the Qing period and influenced the island's distinct historical trajectory relative to mainland China[^70].

The rebellion became emblematic of Taiwan's history of resistance to mainland Chinese control, acquiring symbolic significance that transcended its immediate historical circumstances[^71]. Later movements for Taiwanese autonomy or independence, while ideologically distinct from Zhu's Ming restorationist goals, have sometimes invoked his rebellion as an early example of Taiwanese resistance to external domination[^72]. This symbolic appropriation demonstrates how historical events can be reinterpreted to serve contemporary political purposes[^73].

Zhu's uprising exposed and exacerbated ethnic divisions among Taiwan's Han Chinese population, particularly between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou natives, conflicts that would persist throughout the Qing period and influence Taiwan's social and political development[^74]. The rebellion demonstrated how ethnic and regional identities could be mobilized for political purposes in Taiwan's immigrant society, establishing patterns that would recur in subsequent conflicts[^75].

In Chinese historiography, the Zhu Yigui Rebellion became one of numerous Ming restorationist uprisings that punctuated the early and middle Qing Dynasty, illustrating the continued contestation of Qing legitimacy decades after the Ming Dynasty's fall[^76]. Scholars of Chinese peasant rebellions have studied Zhu's uprising as a case study in the dynamics of rural insurgency, the role of ideology in mobilizing popular support, and the strengths and limitations of peasant-led revolutionary movements[^77].

Folk traditions and popular culture in Taiwan preserved memories of Zhu Yigui, sometimes romanticizing his rebellion as a heroic struggle against oppression[^78]. Temple worship, oral traditions, and later literary works kept his memory alive among common people, often portraying him more sympathetically than official Qing histories[^79]. This folk legacy contributed to Zhu's complex position in Taiwanese cultural memory—simultaneously a failed rebel and a symbol of resistance[^80].

The rebellion's rapid success followed by equally rapid failure illustrated the limitations of charismatic leadership and popular mobilization without sustained military organization, strategic planning, and external support[^81]. Military historians have analyzed Zhu's defeat as demonstrating the ultimate superiority of organized state power over peasant insurgency, regardless of initial successes or popular support[^82].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders and sympathetic interpreters of Zhu Yigui emphasize his rebellion as a legitimate response to genuine grievances against corrupt and oppressive Qing administration in Taiwan[^83]. These scholars argue that Zhu gave voice to the frustrations of common immigrants who suffered under heavy taxation, ethnic discrimination, and arbitrary governance by Qing officials more interested in personal enrichment than just administration[^84]. From this perspective, the rebellion represented popular political agency rather than mere banditry, demonstrating that even marginalized populations could challenge imperial authority when pushed beyond endurance[^85].

Some historians highlight Zhu's organizational and leadership abilities, noting the remarkable feat of assembling and coordinating a multi-ethnic coalition capable of defeating Qing forces and temporarily establishing an alternative government[^86]. They point to his charismatic appeal, tactical intelligence, and ability to articulate a compelling ideological vision as evidence of significant political and military talent, particularly impressive given his humble origins and limited formal education[^87]. These scholars argue that Zhu's ultimate defeat resulted more from the overwhelming resource advantages available to the Qing state than from personal inadequacies[^88].

Defenders emphasize the rebellion's progressive impact on subsequent Qing governance in Taiwan, arguing that without the shock of Zhu's uprising, the imperial government would not have implemented reforms that somewhat improved administrative quality and reduced the worst abuses[^89]. From this perspective, even failed rebellions serve important functions in forcing ruling powers to address grievances and reform oppressive practices[^90]. The rebellion demonstrated to Qing authorities that Taiwan could not be governed through negligence and exploitation without serious consequences[^91].

Taiwanese nationalist historians have sometimes portrayed Zhu Yigui as an early symbol of Taiwanese resistance to mainland Chinese domination, emphasizing his rebellion as evidence of Taiwan's distinct identity and history of opposing external control[^92]. While acknowledging the anachronism of reading modern nationalist sentiments into 18th-century events, these scholars argue that Zhu's uprising revealed fault lines between Taiwan and mainland China that would persist and eventually manifest in contemporary political divisions[^93].

Some scholars appreciate Zhu's use of Ming restorationist ideology not as cynical manipulation but as a sophisticated understanding of available political vocabularies for challenging Qing legitimacy[^94]. They argue that in an era when alternative political ideologies were scarce, invoking Ming restoration represented a pragmatic and culturally resonant strategy for mobilizing opposition to the Qing Dynasty[^95]. This interpretation presents Zhu as politically astute rather than merely deceptive[^96].

### Negative Views

Critics of Zhu Yigui characterize him as an opportunistic bandit who exploited popular grievances and Ming loyalist sentiments for personal power rather than from genuine ideological commitment or concern for popular welfare[^97]. These scholars point to his fraudulent claims of Ming royal descent, the rapid degeneration of his regime into factional conflict and violence, and his failure to establish sustainable governance as evidence that personal ambition rather than political principle motivated his rebellion[^98]. From this perspective, Zhu represented the dangers of charismatic demagogues who manipulate popular frustrations for selfish ends[^99].

Historians critical of the rebellion emphasize the enormous human cost, including massacres of officials and civilians, destruction of property, and ethnic violence that resulted from Zhu's uprising[^100]. They argue that whatever legitimate grievances motivated some participants, the rebellion's actual conduct caused immense suffering that outweighed any theoretical benefits[^101]. The ethnic conflicts between Zhangzhou and Quanzhou natives that intensified during the rebellion created lasting social divisions that harmed Taiwan's development for generations[^102].

Some scholars view Zhu's rebellion as ultimately reactionary rather than progressive, noting that his Ming restorationist ideology looked backward to a fallen dynasty rather than forward to new political arrangements[^103]. They argue that far from representing revolutionary change, Zhu merely sought to replace Qing imperial rule with a restored Ming imperial rule, offering no fundamental transformation of political or social structures[^104]. This interpretation presents the rebellion as a conservative restoration movement rather than a genuinely transformative political project[^105].

Military historians have criticized Zhu's strategic incompetence, particularly his failure to use his temporary control of Taiwan to prepare adequate defenses against the inevitable Qing counterattack[^106]. They point to his rapid defeat once Qing reinforcements arrived as demonstrating fundamental military inadequacies that made his rebellion's failure inevitable regardless of popular support or initial tactical successes[^107]. From this perspective, Zhu's military leadership was characterized more by opportunism and luck than genuine strategic ability[^108].

Critics argue that Zhu's rebellion, rather than improving conditions for Taiwan's population, actually worsened them by provoking harsh Qing reprisals and justifying more restrictive imperial policies toward the island[^109]. The post-rebellion crackdown included mass executions, property confiscations, and increased surveillance that created suffering for many who had not participated in the uprising[^110]. Some scholars contend that Zhu's ill-considered rebellion caused more harm than the Qing abuses it ostensibly opposed[^111].

Orthodox Qing historians and those sympathetic to the dynasty's perspective characterize Zhu as a criminal rebel who violated Confucian norms of loyalty and hierarchical order, threatening legitimate authority and social stability[^112]. From this traditionalist viewpoint, regardless of any administrative shortcomings in Qing governance, armed rebellion against constituted authority represented moral transgression that justified severe punishment[^113]. These interpretations emphasize the chaos and disorder unleashed by the rebellion rather than any legitimate grievances that motivated it[^114].

## Famous Quotes

> "The Qing barbarians have oppressed our people for too long. I am descended from the great Ming emperors, and I shall restore our dynasty to its rightful place!"

This alleged proclamation, reported in various historical accounts, exemplifies Zhu's use of Ming restorationist rhetoric to mobilize support, combining ethnic Han nationalism with claims of imperial legitimacy, though modern scholars doubt the authenticity of this specific wording[^115].

> "Let all righteous people of Taiwan unite to overthrow the foreign oppressors and restore justice to our land!"

According to rebel accounts, Zhu used such appeals to frame the rebellion as a patriotic restoration movement rather than mere criminal uprising, emphasizing themes of justice and ethnic solidarity against Manchu Qing rule[^116].

> "I am but a humble duck farmer, yet heaven has chosen me to right the wrongs inflicted upon our people."

This quote, preserved in folk traditions, reflects Zhu's cultivation of a common-man image that contrasted with corrupt elite officials and enhanced his popular appeal among Taiwan's immigrant laboring population[^117].

> "Better to die resisting tyranny for one day than to live under oppression for a thousand years!"

Attributed to Zhu during the rebellion's final days, this statement supposedly inspired his followers to continue fighting even as Qing victory became inevitable, though its authenticity is questionable[^118].

> "The mandate of heaven has departed from the Qing. The Ming shall rise again, and Taiwan shall be the foundation of our restoration!"

This grandiose claim, reported in Qing official documents describing the rebellion, illustrates Zhu's invocation of traditional Chinese political concepts like the Mandate of Heaven to legitimize his challenge to Qing authority[^119].
