## Summary

Choe Myung-gil (최명길; 崔鳴吉; 1586-1647) was a Korean Joseon Dynasty politician, diplomat, and Neo-Confucian scholar of the Yangmingist school who served as Chief State Councilor from 1638 to 1640 and 1642 to 1644.[^1] He is best remembered as the leader of the Peace Faction (Juhwapa) during the catastrophic Second Manchu invasion of 1636-1637, advocating for pragmatic negotiations with the Qing dynasty to preserve Joseon and protect its people.[^2] His controversial stance against the pro-Ming hardliners led to accusations of collaboration, yet modern historians increasingly view him as a realistic statesman who prioritized national survival over ideological purity.[^3] Coming from the Jeonju Choe clan, he became one of Korea's most skilled diplomats, compared by Western scholars to Cardinal Richelieu for his role in establishing diplomatic foundations during one of the most turbulent periods in Korean history.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Choe Myung-gil was born on October 7, 1586, into the prestigious Jeonju Choe clan, one of the prominent aristocratic lineages of the Joseon Dynasty.[^5] His mother was Lady Yu of the Jeonju Yu clan (1556-1615), whose father was Yu Yeong-rip (1537-1599).[^6] He grew up in a family of scholar-officials during the reign of King Seonjo, a period marked by the devastating Japanese invasions of Korea (Imjin War, 1592-1598) that would profoundly shape his worldview about national security and foreign policy.[^7]

As a member of the yangban aristocracy, Choe received a classical Confucian education, mastering the Chinese classics and Neo-Confucian philosophy that formed the intellectual foundation of Joseon governance.[^8] He had an older brother, Choe Nae-gil (Prince Wancheon, 1583-1649), and two younger brothers: Choe Hye-gil (1591-1662) and Choe Ga-gil.[^9] This family network would prove important throughout his political career, as factional politics and kinship ties played crucial roles in Joseon administration.[^10]

What distinguished Choe from many of his contemporaries was his adherence to the Yangmingist school of Neo-Confucianism, a minority position in Joseon Korea where the orthodox Zhu Xi school dominated.[^11] Yangming thought emphasized intuitive moral knowledge and practical action over pure textual scholarship, which may have influenced Choe's later pragmatic approach to diplomacy and statecraft.[^12] His education took place during a formative period when Joseon was reassessing its foreign policy after the near-catastrophic Japanese invasions, creating an intellectual environment where questions of national survival and diplomatic strategy were paramount.[^13]

Coming of age in the early 17th century, Choe witnessed Joseon's recovery from Japanese invasion and its increasingly precarious position between the declining Ming dynasty and the rising Jurchen/Manchu power in Manchuria.[^14] This geopolitical reality would define his entire career and force him to confront impossible choices between ideological loyalty and pragmatic survival.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Choe Myung-gil's rise to prominence came through the traditional path of civil service examinations and bureaucratic advancement in the Joseon government.[^16] His scholarly credentials and administrative abilities allowed him to navigate the complex factional politics of the early 17th century court, where rival groups competed for influence through philosophical debates and policy disputes.[^17] By the 1620s, he had established himself as a capable official with expertise in diplomatic and foreign affairs, precisely when Joseon faced its gravest external threat since the Japanese invasions.[^18]

The first major crisis that elevated Choe's profile was the Later Jin invasion of 1627, known as the Jeongmyo Horan.[^19] In early 1627, the Later Jin prince Amin led 30,000 troops into Joseon under the guidance of defected Korean general Gang Hong-rip and Chinese turncoat Li Yongfang.[^20] The Jurchens met sharp resistance at border towns, but Joseon garrisons were quickly defeated, and Pyongyang fell without a fight.[^21] This three-month invasion ended with a peace treaty that forced Joseon to abandon the Ming era name and establish tributary relations with the Later Jin, though Korean elites deeply resented the "barbarian" Jurchens and continued to secretly support the Ming.[^22]

During and after this crisis, Choe emerged as one of the leading voices for diplomatic engagement with the Jurchen threat.[^23] While hardline officials advocated military resistance and absolute loyalty to the Ming dynasty based on Confucian principles of righteousness (yi), Choe assessed the military balance realistically and recognized that Joseon could not defeat the rising Manchu power.[^24] This position placed him at the center of an intensifying factional dispute that would explode into crisis a decade later.[^25]

When the Later Jin transformed into the Qing dynasty in 1636 and its emperor Hong Taiji demanded that Joseon acknowledge this new status, the Korean court split into two diametrically opposed factions.[^26] The Anti-peace Faction (Cheok-hwap'a), led by Kim Sang-hun and other pro-Ming loyalists, insisted on maintaining absolute fidelity to the Ming regardless of consequences.[^27] The Peace Faction (Juhwap'a), led by Choe Myung-gil, argued for pragmatic accommodation to preserve the state and protect the people.[^28] King Injo, afraid of confrontation, initially listened to Choe's advice and dispatched peace-seeking messengers to Shenyang in September 1636, but they were denied a meeting with Hong Taiji.[^29]

This failure enraged the hardliners and led to Choe's dismissal from office in late 1636.[^30] However, when Hong Taiji launched a massive invasion in December 1636, leading 120,000 Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese troops in a three-pronged attack on Joseon, the desperate king urgently recalled Choe to service.[^31] As Qing forces rushed toward the capital through a lightning offensive, Choe volunteered to go to the Qing army as an envoy, declaring "I will ask for their demands," and succeeded in delaying the enemy advance, buying precious time for King Injo to reach the fortress of Namhansanseong.[^32] Hong Taiji was initially angry at this diplomatic maneuver but eventually released Choe, saying "Choi Myung-gil is loyal," recognizing the Korean diplomat's courage and skill.[^33]

## Major Achievements

Choe Myung-gil's primary achievement was serving as Joseon's chief negotiator during the 47-day siege of Namhansanseong Fortress from December 1636 to January 1637, one of the most critical moments in Korean history.[^34] The fortress, located on a mountain south of Seoul, became the refuge for King Injo and his court when Qing forces rapidly overran the Korean peninsula.[^35] Inside the besieged fortress, Choe faced not only external military pressure but also internal political warfare, as his rival Kim Sang-hun used the crisis to discredit him on numerous occasions.[^36]

Throughout the siege, Choe maintained diplomatic contact with the Qing forces while the Peace and Resistance Factions battled over strategy.[^37] The Peace Faction officials remembered previous humiliations but proceeded pragmatically, drawing inspiration from Goujian, the ancient king of Yue who endured subjugation to rebuild his strength for eventual revenge.[^38] The Resistance Faction, led by Kim Sang-hun, insisted on fighting to the death rather than submit to the "barbarian" Qing, citing Confucian principles of righteousness and loyalty to the Ming.[^39] Both King Injo and Confucian officials maintained anti-Qing sentiment regardless of factional divisions, but Choe recognized that ideological purity would not prevent military defeat and humanitarian catastrophe.[^40]

After 47 days, with food and supplies exhausted and the strategic fortress of Ganghwa Island fallen, King Injo had no choice but to surrender on January 30, 1637.[^41] At the end of the siege, Choe participated in crucial conversations with the Qing commander Ingguldai and other officials regarding surrender terms.[^42] The resulting treaty was devastating: King Injo had to perform the kowtow ritual before Hong Taiji at Samjeondo, allegedly repeating the humiliating ceremony eight times, symbolizing Joseon's acknowledgment of Qing overlordship.[^43] Joseon was forced to sever ties with the Ming, establish tributary relations with the Qing, offer Crown Prince Sohyeon and Prince Bongrim as hostages along with sons or brothers of ministers, pay annual tribute, and provide troops for the Qing war against Ming.[^44]

After the surrender, Choe made a critical statement to King Injo: "As long as two princes are held as hostages, it is wise for us to meet every demand by the Qing in order to avoid any further suspicion about our loyalty."[^45] King Injo agreed to comply with Choe's suggestions, though he still felt indebted to the Ming.[^46] This pragmatic approach to managing the tributary relationship reflected Choe's diplomatic philosophy: maintain outward compliance while preserving the kingdom's core integrity and waiting for opportunities to restore independence.[^47]

Choe's diplomatic skills earned him the highest position in Joseon government: Chief State Councilor (Yeonguijeong), which he held from 1638 to 1640 and again from 1642 to 1644.[^48] The Chief State Councilor was the highest government position in Joseon, participating in the administration of general government affairs alongside the Left and Right State Councilors.[^49] In this role, Choe managed the delicate balance of maintaining the forced tributary relationship with the Qing while trying to preserve Joseon's autonomy and administer domestic affairs during a period of national trauma and reconstruction.[^50]

His administration faced enormous challenges. Crown Prince Sohyeon and Prince Bongrim, along with their families, spent eight years as hostages in Shenyang, the Qing capital.[^51] During captivity, Prince Sohyeon worked tirelessly as a mediator between Joseon and Qing, spending vast sums to bribe Qing officials and prevent further hostilities.[^52] Meanwhile, the humiliating Samjeondo Monument was erected in 1639 at Hong Taiji's order to commemorate Joseon's submission, a structure that would become a hated symbol of national shame.[^53]

Western scholars who specialized in Korean history have evaluated Choe Myung-gil as the Cardinal Richelieu of Joseon, comparing his diplomatic acumen and political realism to the French minister who established diplomatic foundations during a similarly turbulent period.[^54] Together with Seo-hee of Goryeo and Wonjong of Goryeo, he is recognized as one of the best diplomats in Korean history.[^55] Externally, in the rapidly changing situation of Northeast Asia due to Manchu growth, he tried to protect the people by maintaining and preserving the state through reconciliation rather than pursuing ideological confrontation that would result in total destruction.[^56]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Choe Myung-gil remains one of the most controversial figures in Korean history, with his legacy bitterly contested from his own time to the present.[^57] Traditional Korean historiography, dominated by Confucian scholars who valued ideological righteousness above pragmatic survival, often portrayed him negatively as a collaborator or even traitor who betrayed Korea's sacred bond with the Ming dynasty.[^58] His minister position and his role in spearheading the deal that led to surrender earned him condemnation from those who believed that death with honor was preferable to life under subjugation.[^59]

The intensity of criticism Choe faced is evident in the historical record of the siege itself. Kim Sang-hun, his chief rival and the leading voice of the Resistance Faction, used his diary to discredit Choe on numerous occasions during the Namhansanseong crisis.[^60] These accounts portrayed Choe as defeatist, cowardly, and willing to abandon Confucian principles for expedient accommodation with barbarians.[^61] The factional conflict was not merely about military strategy but represented a fundamental philosophical divide about the nature of righteousness and statecraft.[^62]

The ideological foundation for criticism of Choe rested on the principle of sadae ("serving the great"), which construed China as the center of a Confucian moral universe.[^63] By the early 1500s, the relationship between Ming and Joseon had been reinforced through a father-son dynamic, with Joseon elites regarding the Ming emperor not just as a suzerain but as a ritual father figure.[^64] This transformation held immense significance because, unlike the changeable loyalty to a ruler, the Confucian principle of filial piety was considered immutable and irrevocable.[^65] To abandon the Ming was thus not merely a diplomatic shift but a form of patricide, a violation of the most sacred Confucian obligation.[^66]

After the Qing conquest of China proper and the fall of the Ming in 1644, Joseon scholars developed the ideology of "Sungmyeong Baecheong" (Enhancing Ming and Rejecting Qing), which excluded the Qing as "Manchurian barbarians" and respected the already ruined Ming as the only Chinese orthodoxy.[^67] This "righteous doctrine" became even more entrenched in the 17th and 18th centuries, with the Sino-centric vision (Hwairon) spreading widely among Joseon scholars despite the Ming's collapse.[^68] In this intellectual climate, Choe's pragmatic acceptance of Qing dominance appeared even more reprehensible in retrospect.[^69]

The spirit of righteousness (Yiri), which highly respected the Moral Code (Gangsang) and Fidelity (Jeolyi) according to classical Confucian principles, was the core standard in Joseon.[^70] Choe's critics argued that he violated these fundamental principles by prioritizing physical survival over moral integrity.[^71] No one wanted to compose the epitaph for the Samjeondo Stele, as it was obvious that it would be a great humiliation for the family involved.[^72] The monument itself suffered vandalism on several occasions and was buried multiple times from 1639 onward because it was regarded as a symbol of humiliating history.[^73] In 1956, the South Korean ministry of culture and education reinterred the monument, explicitly identifying it as a record of national humiliation.[^74]

Choe's dismissal from office in late 1636, just before the invasion, demonstrated the political danger of his position.[^75] Even after the desperate circumstances of the siege proved him correct about Joseon's military weakness, and even after King Injo relied entirely on his diplomatic skills to negotiate surrender, Choe never fully escaped the stigma of collaboration.[^76] His advocacy for meeting every Qing demand to avoid suspicion about loyalty was necessary for protecting the royal hostages and preventing further invasions, but it reinforced accusations that he was excessively accommodating to foreign domination.[^77]

The controversy extended beyond his lifetime. Despite achieving the highest government position and serving with distinction as Chief State Councilor, traditional Korean historiography treated him with ambivalence at best and condemnation at worst.[^78] The fact that he had no biological children and adopted his younger brother's son suggests personal tragedy that may have affected his legacy, as he lacked direct descendants to defend his reputation.[^79] His adoptive son Choe Hu-ryang and grandson Choe Seok-jeong continued the family line, but the shadow of the 1637 surrender haunted the family name.[^80]

---

## Personal Life

Choe Myung-gil married Lady Jang of the Indong Jang clan, but the couple had no biological children.[^81] This personal circumstance, which would have been considered a serious misfortune in Confucian society where continuing the family line was a sacred filial duty, led them to adopt Choe Hu-ryang, Prince Walleung (1616-1693), the second son of Choe's younger brother Choe Hye-gil.[^82] Choe Hu-ryang married Lady Ahn of the Gwangju Ahn clan, and among their children was Choe Seok-jeong (1646-1715), who became the adoptive son of his uncle Choe Hu-sang.[^83]

Little specific information survives about Choe's private life, family relationships, or personal characteristics beyond his public role.[^84] The historical records from the Joseon period, particularly the Veritable Records (Sillok), focused primarily on official activities and policy debates rather than personal details.[^85] What can be inferred from his actions during the national crisis of 1636-1637 suggests a man of considerable personal courage—volunteering to face Hong Taiji's anger as an envoy required risking his life—and unwavering commitment to his principles, even when they made him deeply unpopular.[^86]

His adherence to Yangmingist Neo-Confucianism, a minority philosophical position in Joseon where Zhu Xi orthodoxy dominated, indicates an independent intellectual temperament.[^87] Yangming thought emphasized intuitive moral knowledge and the unity of knowledge and action, which may explain Choe's practical, action-oriented approach to diplomacy rather than the more abstract, principle-centered stance of his hardline opponents.[^88] This philosophical orientation likely made him more willing to prioritize concrete outcomes—saving lives and preserving the state—over ideological consistency.[^89]

The intense political pressure Choe endured throughout the 1636-1637 crisis and its aftermath must have taken an enormous personal toll. Kim Sang-hun's repeated attempts to discredit him, his dismissal from office before the invasion, the accusations of collaboration and treason, and the permanent stigma attached to his name all suggest a career defined by sacrifice and vilification despite his essential service to king and country.[^90] Hong Taiji's acknowledgment that "Choi Myung-gil is loyal" represents one of the few contemporary recognitions of his integrity, ironically coming from the enemy emperor rather than his own countrymen.[^91]

Choe died on June 19, 1647, at the age of 60, just three years after completing his second term as Chief State Councilor and a decade after the traumatic siege of Namhansanseong.[^92] He lived to see Crown Prince Sohyeon return from Qing captivity in 1645, only to die mysteriously shortly thereafter—found bleeding from the head under circumstances that spawned legends of assassination by King Injo.[^93] Prince Sohyeon, who had worked tirelessly as a mediator in Shenyang much as Choe had done during the invasion, met a tragic end that mirrored the fate of those who pursued pragmatic engagement with the Qing.[^94]

## Legacy

Choe Myung-gil's legacy has undergone dramatic reinterpretation over the centuries, reflecting changing attitudes toward diplomacy, realism, and national survival.[^95] In traditional Korean historiography, dominated by Confucian scholars who valued righteousness and loyalty to the Ming above all else, Choe occupied an ambiguous or negative position as someone who prioritized pragmatic survival over ideological principles.[^96] The Samjeondo Monument, which stood as a permanent reminder of the 1637 humiliation, symbolized everything that traditionalists condemned about his approach—accommodation with barbarians and acceptance of shameful submission.[^97]

However, modern reassessment has been far more sympathetic to Choe's position.[^98] Twentieth and twenty-first century historians, evaluating the 1636-1637 crisis from a perspective that values national preservation and protection of civilian populations, increasingly view Choe as a realist and pragmatist who made agonizingly difficult but ultimately correct decisions.[^99] His assessment that Joseon could not militarily defeat the Qing was entirely accurate—continued resistance would have resulted in total conquest, massive loss of life, and potentially the complete destruction of the Joseon state.[^100]

The comparison Western scholars have made between Choe and Cardinal Richelieu reflects this modern rehabilitation.[^101] Like Richelieu, who prioritized French national interests over Catholic solidarity during the Thirty Years' War, Choe placed the survival of Joseon above abstract ideological commitments to the Ming.[^102] Both statesmen faced intense criticism for their realpolitik approaches but ultimately secured their nations' continued existence during existential crises.[^103]

Choe's cultural legacy experienced a significant revival through modern media portrayals. He has been depicted in numerous Korean television series, including "The Three Musketeers" (2014) where he was portrayed by Jeon No-min, and other dramas in 2013, 2015, and 2023.[^104] Most significantly, Lee Byung-hun's portrayal of Choe in the 2017 film "The Fortress" brought his story to a mass contemporary audience.[^105] The film, directed by Hwang Dong-hyuk and based on Kim Hoon's novel Namhansanseong, presented Choe as a "taciturn minister of the interior who dearly wishes to avoid a war he fears King Injo is ill-prepared to wage."[^106]

"The Fortress" shifted the narrative lens, portraying Choe's pragmatism sympathetically and suggesting that his willingness to negotiate was an act of courage rather than cowardice.[^107] The script clearly aimed at pulling sympathies toward his position, presenting the final surrender not as shameful capitulation but as "the noblest sacrifice."[^108] This cinematic rehabilitation reflects broader changes in how Korean society views the complex choices leaders face when confronting overwhelming military force.[^109]

The Samjeondo Monument itself underwent a transformation from symbol of shame to recognized cultural heritage.[^110] Though it was buried and unearthed multiple times due to the strong emotional charge attached to it, it was eventually registered as a cultural property in recognition that even shameful events in history must be remembered.[^111] After being unearthed in a 1963 flood, authorities decided to preserve it as a historical artifact rather than destroy or rebury it.[^112] This shift represents a mature historical consciousness that can acknowledge painful episodes without being paralyzed by shame.[^113]

Together with Seo-hee and Wonjong of Goryeo, Choe is now recognized as one of the best diplomats in Korean history, a significant reversal from his historical reputation.[^114] His legacy raises fundamental questions about the nature of leadership during national crisis: Is it more honorable to fight hopelessly and lose everything, or to negotiate shameful terms that preserve the nation for future generations?[^115] Choe chose the latter path, enduring personal vilification and historical condemnation to save Joseon from total destruction.[^116]

The Peace Faction's approach, which Choe articulated, drew inspiration from ancient Chinese statecraft—specifically the perseverance of Goujian, king of Yue, who endured subjugation and humiliation to eventually rebuild his strength and achieve revenge.[^117] This long-term perspective valued the preservation of state and people as the foundation for eventual restoration of independence, even if that meant accepting temporary humiliation.[^118] History vindicated this approach: Joseon survived as an independent kingdom for another 260 years after 1637, whereas military resistance would likely have resulted in Qing occupation and possible integration into the Manchu empire.[^119]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars and historians have increasingly recognized Choe Myung-gil as a tragic hero whose realistic assessment of Joseon's strategic situation was entirely correct, even if it conflicted with the dominant ideology of his time.[^120] His willingness to negotiate with the Qing reflected not defeatism but a sober understanding of military capabilities and international power dynamics.[^121] The Qing invasion force of 120,000 troops, including experienced Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese soldiers who had been conquering territory across Northeast Asia, vastly outmatched Joseon's poorly prepared military.[^122] Choe's recognition of this reality demonstrated strategic wisdom rather than cowardice.[^123]

Supporters argue that Choe's diplomatic approach saved countless Korean lives that would have been lost in hopeless military resistance.[^124] The 47-day siege of Namhansanseong already exhausted food and supplies; prolonged fighting would have led to starvation, disease, and massacre of the besieged court and soldiers.[^125] Moreover, the fall of Ganghwa Island meant that even the royal family's emergency refuge had been compromised, leaving literally no viable military options.[^126] In this context, Choe's negotiation of surrender terms prevented a catastrophic outcome.[^127]

The comparison to Cardinal Richelieu highlights Choe's sophisticated understanding of raison d'état—the principle that state survival and national interest sometimes require actions that conflict with ideological or moral preferences.[^128] Just as Richelieu allied Catholic France with Protestant powers against the Catholic Habsburgs to preserve French security, Choe advocated accommodation with the Qing despite Confucian loyalty to the Ming to preserve Joseon's existence.[^129] This form of political realism, which prioritizes outcomes over principles, has gained appreciation in modern strategic thought.[^130]

His statement to King Injo after the surrender—"As long as two princes are held as hostages, it is wise for us to meet every demand by the Qing in order to avoid any further suspicion about our loyalty"—demonstrates his understanding of hostage dynamics and his commitment to protecting the royal princes during their captivity.[^131] Crown Prince Sohyeon and Prince Bongrim spent eight years in Shenyang, during which they could have been executed at any time if the Qing suspected Joseon disloyalty.[^132] Choe's policy of outward compliance, however humiliating, kept the hostages alive and eventually allowed their return in 1645.[^133]

Hong Taiji's recognition that "Choi Myung-gil is loyal" provides important contemporary testimony to his character.[^134] The Qing emperor, who had every reason to distrust Joseon officials and could have easily executed Choe when he volunteered as an envoy, instead respected his courage and integrity.[^135] This suggests that even Joseon's enemies recognized qualities in Choe that his own countrymen often failed to appreciate.[^136]

Modern Korean society, having experienced Japanese colonization, Korean War division, and rapid modernization, has developed a more nuanced appreciation for the difficult choices leaders face when confronting superior force.[^137] The 2017 film "The Fortress" reflects this evolved perspective, presenting Choe sympathetically as someone who "dearly wishes to avoid a war" that would devastate the nation.[^138] This portrayal resonates with contemporary audiences who understand that ideological purity is a luxury nations cannot afford when facing existential threats.[^139]

Academic historians have noted that the Peace Faction's strategy, while accepting temporary humiliation, preserved Joseon's fundamental sovereignty and allowed the kingdom to survive for another 260 years until the late 19th century.[^140] In contrast, the Resistance Faction's approach, had it been followed, would likely have resulted in Qing occupation, possible integration into the Manchu empire, and the potential end of independent Korean statehood.[^141] From this perspective, Choe's "collaboration" was actually the most patriotic course available under the circumstances.[^142]

### Negative Views

Despite modern rehabilitation, significant criticism of Choe Myung-gil persists, rooted in traditional Confucian ethics and Korean nationalist historiography.[^143] Critics argue that his pragmatic approach betrayed fundamental principles of righteousness (yi) and loyalty that should never be compromised regardless of practical consequences.[^144] In Confucian political philosophy, the moral character of actions matters more than their outcomes; a righteous defeat is more honorable than a pragmatic but shameful survival.[^145]

The traditional view, articulated most forcefully by Kim Sang-hun and other Resistance Faction leaders, held that Joseon's relationship with the Ming dynasty was not merely a strategic alliance but a sacred moral bond based on sadae ideology.[^146] The Ming had supported Joseon during the catastrophic Japanese invasions of 1592-1598, sending armies that helped save the Korean kingdom from conquest.[^147] To abandon this benefactor in its hour of need violated the Confucian principle of repaying obligation (eun), which was considered one of the most fundamental ethical duties.[^148]

The "Sungmyeong Baecheong" ideology that dominated Joseon intellectual life after 1644 explicitly rejected the Qing as barbarian usurpers who could never possess legitimate authority regardless of their military power.[^149] From this perspective, recognizing Qing sovereignty was not a pragmatic accommodation but a fundamental betrayal of civilization itself—accepting barbarian domination over the cultured Confucian world order.[^150] Choe's willingness to accept this arrangement appeared as moral capitulation to those who believed that cultural and ethical principles transcended political and military realities.[^151]

Critics point to the lasting damage of the 1637 surrender beyond the immediate humiliation.[^152] The Samjeondo Monument stood for centuries as a permanent reminder of Korean subjugation, a source of national shame that poisoned Korean consciousness.[^153] The ritual kowtowing of King Injo before Hong Taiji, allegedly repeated eight times, created a psychological wound that affected Korean self-perception and contributed to later difficulties in developing an independent foreign policy.[^154] Some historians argue that accepting such complete humiliation had long-term costs that outweighed the short-term benefit of avoiding military destruction.[^155]

The precedent Choe's approach set may have contributed to later Korean failures to resist external pressure effectively.[^156] If diplomatic accommodation and acceptance of tributary status became the default response to foreign threats, Korea's ability to maintain genuine independence was compromised.[^157] Critics suggest that a more spirited resistance, even if ultimately defeated, would have established a tradition of defiance that could have served Korea better in subsequent centuries when facing Japanese and Western imperialism.[^158]

Kim Sang-hun's faction argued that death with honor was preferable to life under shameful conditions.[^159] This samurai-like ethic, emphasizing personal and national honor above survival, has deep roots in East Asian martial culture and Confucian scholarship.[^160] From this perspective, Choe's calculation that preserving physical existence justified any diplomatic concession represented a fundamental failure to understand what makes life worth living—namely, dignity, autonomy, and adherence to principle.[^161]

Some modern nationalist historians, while acknowledging the military impossibility of defeating the Qing, still criticize Choe for being too accommodating in the surrender negotiations and too willing to comply with Qing demands thereafter.[^162] They argue that a more skillful diplomat might have secured better terms or found ways to maintain greater autonomy while formally accepting tributary status.[^163] The fact that Choe advised "meeting every demand" to avoid suspicion suggests excessive compliance rather than shrewd negotiation.[^164]

The traditional epithet that Choe and his faction were "traitors" who spearheaded the shameful surrender deal persists in some Korean historiographical traditions.[^165] Even modern portrayals that attempt to rehabilitate his reputation must contend with centuries of negative historical judgment embedded in Korean cultural memory.[^166] The emotional power of the Resistance Faction's position—that some things are worth dying for—continues to resonate with those who value principle over pragmatism in national leadership.[^167]
