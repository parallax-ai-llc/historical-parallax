## Summary

Peyton Rous discovered that viruses could cause cancer, demonstrating in 1911 that a sarcoma in chickens could be transmitted by a cell-free filtrate containing what became known as Rous sarcoma virus. His discovery was so ahead of its time that he did not receive the Nobel Prize until 1966, fifty-five years after his original publication.
