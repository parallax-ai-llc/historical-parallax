## Summary

An Junggeun (안중근; September 2, 1879 – March 26, 1910), also known by his baptismal name Thomas, was a Korean independence activist and martyr who became one of the most celebrated figures in Korean history. He is best known for assassinating Itō Hirobumi, the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea and former Prime Minister of Japan, at Harbin Railway Station on October 26, 1909. An was executed by Japanese authorities on March 26, 1910, just months before Japan's formal annexation of Korea. Today, he is revered as a national hero in both South and North Korea, while his actions remain controversial in Japan, where some view him as a terrorist.

---

## Early Life and Background

An Junggeun was born on September 2, 1879, in Haeju, Hwanghae Province, in the Joseon Kingdom (now part of North Korea).[^1] He was the eldest child among three sons and one daughter in the family of An Taehun and Jo Maria, belonging to the prestigious Sunheung An clan.[^2] His childhood name was An Eungchil. The An family was part of the yangban (aristocratic) class, which provided young An with educational opportunities typical of his social status.

Like most children from aristocratic families, An was educated at the local Seodang (traditional Korean school), where he spent nine years studying Chinese classical literature and neo-Confucian philosophy.[^3] However, as a boy, he was more interested in martial arts and marksmanship than in his scholarly studies.[^4] Kim Gu, who would later become a prominent leader of the Korean independence movement and who had taken refuge in An Taehun's house at the time, recalled that young An Junggeun was an excellent marksman, enjoyed reading books, and possessed strong charisma.[^5] When his classmates taunted him for his lack of scholarly knowledge, An reportedly said he wanted to become like Xiang Yu, the legendary military general from China's Warring States period.[^6]

At the age of 16, An entered the Catholic Church along with his father, receiving the baptismal name "Thomas" and learning French.[^7] While it appears that An Taehun converted partly due to the power and protection the Catholic Church could offer, An Junggeun wrote in his autobiography that after his baptism, he learned more about the faith and became a devout and sincere believer.[^8] While fleeing from Japanese authorities, An took refuge with a French priest named Wilhelm, who baptized him and hid him in his church for several months. The priest encouraged An to read the Bible and engaged him in theological discussions that deepened his faith.[^9]

At age 25, An started a coal business, but after the Eulsa Treaty of 1905, which made Korea a Japanese protectorate, he devoted himself to educating the Korean people.[^10] He established two private schools—the Donghee School and the Samheung School—in the northwestern region of Korea, serving as principal of both institutions.[^11] These schools represented An's belief that education was essential for Korean independence and national development.

## Rise to Prominence in the Independence Movement

The signing of the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905 (known as the Eulsa Treaty) was a turning point in An Junggeun's life. This treaty, signed under coercion, made Korea a protectorate of Japan and stripped the Korean government of its diplomatic sovereignty. Witnessing his country's loss of independence, An abandoned his business ventures and educational work to join the armed resistance movement.[^12]

After the establishment of the Japanese protectorate in 1905, An Junggeun moved to Vladivostok in Russia, where he organized a righteous army (Uibyeong) to fight against the Japanese.[^13] In 1907, he exiled himself to Vladivostok to join the armed resistance against Japanese colonial rule, where he learned fluent Russian.[^14] He was appointed lieutenant general of an armed Korean resistance group and led several cross-border attacks against Japanese forces.[^15]

In 1908, An crossed the Tumen River with his troops and raided Japanese military camps in Gyeongheung and Hoeryeong in Hamgyeong Province, achieving significant victories in these battles.[^16] However, with only about 150 troops under his command, An eventually had to withdraw from these attacks and rethink his strategy.[^17] The military campaigns demonstrated both his courage and the harsh reality of the numerical and technological superiority of Japanese forces.

In early 1909, An joined the Danjihoe (단지회), a Korean independence organization dedicated to resisting Japanese colonization.[^18] On March 1909, in a village near Vladivostok called Yinqiu, An participated in one of the most symbolic acts of the Korean independence movement. Together with eleven fellow independence activists—including U Deok-sun and Kim Gi-yeol—An cut off the last joint of his left ring finger.[^19] Using their blood, they wrote "Korean Independence" (대한독립, 大韓獨立) on the Taegeukgi (Korean national flag), pledging their lives to their country's independence.[^20] This dramatic blood oath became a defining moment in An's commitment to the independence cause. The missing fingertip would later become his signature mark on the hundreds of calligraphy works he created while imprisoned.

After the finger-cutting ceremony, An began planning the assassination of Itō Hirobumi, whom he considered the architect of Korea's colonization. He traveled throughout the Russian Far East, gathering intelligence and waiting for the right opportunity to strike.[^21]

## Major Achievement: The Assassination of Itō Hirobumi

On October 26, 1909, An Junggeun carried out the act that would immortalize him in Korean history. At Harbin Railway Station in Manchuria, he assassinated Itō Hirobumi, who was returning from negotiations with Russian representatives.[^22] Itō had served as Japan's first Prime Minister and was the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea, making him the primary symbol of Japanese imperialism in Korea.

As Itō Hirobumi's train arrived at the platform, An, disguised as a member of the press corps, approached and fired seven shots from his FN M1900 pistol.[^23] Three bullets struck Itō in the abdomen, inflicting fatal wounds. An also shot several Japanese officials accompanying Itō, including the Consul General, a Secretary of the Imperial Household Agency, and an executive of the South Manchuria Railway, all of whom were seriously injured.[^24]

Immediately after the shooting, An demonstrated the political nature of his act. He yelled "Корея! Ура!" (Korea! Hurrah!) in Russian and waved the Korean flag.[^25] This dramatic declaration ensured that witnesses understood his action as a political statement rather than simple murder. Russian guards quickly arrested An and held him for two days before turning him over to Japanese colonial authorities.[^26]

When interrogated, An Junggeun articulated a detailed list of fifteen crimes he accused Itō Hirobumi of committing against Korea and East Asia.[^27] These charges included:

1. The murder of Empress Myeongseong (Queen Min) in 1895
2. Forcing the abdication of Emperor Gojong in 1907
3. Disbanding the Korean army in 1907
4. Plundering Korea's natural resources and infrastructure
5. Taking control of Korea's currency
6. Forcing the signing of the treaties of 1905 and 1907
7. Causing the deaths of thousands of Koreans
8. Destroying peace in East Asia
9. Deceiving the Japanese Emperor about conditions in Korea
10. Hindering education in Korea by requiring government approval for private schools
11. Assassinating the Japanese Emperor Kōmei
12. Deceiving the world into thinking Koreans wanted to be a Japanese protectorate[^28]

An insisted that his actions were not those of a common criminal but rather an act of war. He declared during his interrogation: "My assassination of Ito is a part of the war for Korea's independence. I lost the battle, which is why I am in the court of Japan as a prisoner of war. I did not act as a private citizen, but rather as a lieutenant general of the Korean resistance army for independence and Asian peace. Thus, by international law, I should be treated as a prisoner of war."[^29]

The assassination had immediate and far-reaching consequences. The killing of Itō was an international incident, attracting worldwide attention to Korea's plight under Japanese domination.[^30] The assassination of Itō by An was praised by Koreans and many Chinese who were struggling against Japanese invasion at the time. Well-known Chinese political leaders such as Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen, and Liang Qichao wrote poems acclaiming An's courage.[^31]

## Trial, Imprisonment, and Execution

An Junggeun's trial became a public spectacle. He was provided with Japanese defense lawyers, but the outcome had been predetermined.[^32] During the proceedings at the Japanese colonial court in Lüshun (Port Arthur), An maintained his dignity and continued to assert his status as a prisoner of war rather than a criminal. On February 14, 1910, he was sentenced to death.[^33]

Although he expected the death sentence, An was angered that he was not recognized as a prisoner of war. He requested execution by firing squad, befitting his status as a military officer, but Japanese authorities ordered that he be hanged as a common criminal.[^34] This decision was a deliberate humiliation designed to delegitimize his political motives.

During his 144 days of imprisonment in Lüshun Prison, An Junggeun demonstrated extraordinary productivity and resilience. He penned approximately 200 calligraphy works, wrote his autobiography titled "History of An Eung-chil," and began writing his political treatise "On Peace in East Asia" (東洋平和論; 동양평화론).[^35] Even his Japanese captors were moved by his words and conduct, and many requested calligraphy works from him, which he generously provided.[^36]

An's calligraphy works are remarkable both for their artistic merit and their political content. Though he had never formally studied calligraphy, his works expressed profound messages about Korean independence and peace in Asia.[^37] He would sign his calligraphy with "大韓國人" (Great Korean) and include a handprint of his left hand, clearly showing the missing joint of his ring finger—a permanent reminder of his blood oath.[^38] To date, sixty-two of An's writings from this period have been identified, both in Korea and abroad, with twenty-six designated as National Treasures of Korea.[^39] In recent years, his calligraphy works have fetched extraordinary prices at auction, with one piece selling for 1.3 billion won ($976,000) in 2010.[^40]

An's unfinished masterwork, "On Peace in East Asia," articulated a visionary concept of Pan-Asianism. He strongly believed in the union of the three great countries of East Asia—China, Korea, and Japan—to counter Western imperialism and restore East Asian independence.[^41] In this work, An recommended the organization of combined armed forces and the issuance of joint banknotes among Korea, Japan, and China—a concept remarkably similar to the modern European Union.[^42] Professor Sasagawa Norikatsu of Meiji University highly praised An's idea, noting that it preceded the concept of the League of Nations by ten years.[^43]

An requested a sentence extension to complete his book, but his request was denied.[^44] In his final days, he received Korean white clothing from his mother to wear during his execution, a traditional Korean funeral garment.[^45] He never had a chance to reunite with his family after the Harbin incident; his wife Kim A-ryeo and their children arrived in Harbin the day after the shooting, when he had already been taken into custody.[^46]

An Junggeun was executed by hanging on March 26, 1910, at the age of 30.[^47] His final request was that his wardens help him finish his essay "On Peace in East Asia." In his last letter to his wife, he maintained his Catholic faith, even asking that his son become a priest.[^48] He also expressed his vision for his burial: "If I die, bury my bones in Harbin Park and when my country finally gains its deserved independence, move me there and have my funeral. Even when I am in heaven, I will be using all my power to assist the Korean independence movement."[^49]

Just five months after An's execution, on August 22, 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea through the Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty.[^50] While some historians argue that the assassination accelerated Japan's path toward full annexation, others note that although his act did not have an immediate impact on preventing annexation, An's patriotism served as a source of inspiration to loyalists and independence fighters throughout the 35-year Japanese occupation.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

An Junggeun's legacy remains deeply controversial, particularly in Japan and among international scholars who debate the ethics of political assassination. The fundamental controversy centers on whether An should be considered a freedom fighter and patriot or a terrorist and criminal.

**Japanese Perspective:**

Japan continues to view An Junggeun as a terrorist who committed murder. In 2014, when China opened a memorial hall dedicated to An in Harbin, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga stated: "We believe that he is a terrorist who assassinated the first prime minister of Japan and was handed down the death sentence."[^52] This view reflects Japan's position that Itō Hirobumi was a legitimate government official and that his assassination was an act of terrorism, not warfare. Japan has consistently protested against memorials and honors bestowed upon An, viewing such commemorations as provocative acts that glorify violence.[^53]

**The Terrorism Debate:**

The characterization of An's actions as terrorism raises complex philosophical and legal questions about the nature of resistance to colonial occupation. Critics argue that the assassination of a political figure, regardless of motive, constitutes terrorism. They point out that Itō was not on a battlefield but engaged in diplomatic travel when he was killed. Some scholars also note that the assassination may have been counterproductive, potentially accelerating rather than preventing Korea's annexation.[^54]

**Evolution of North Korean Interpretation:**

Interestingly, North Korea's assessment of An Junggeun has evolved over time. In the early stages of the North Korean state, An's behavior was understood as a "patriotic terrorist movement," with negative connotations.[^55] However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, North Korea's attitude shifted to sympathy for his motives, and he was later reinterpreted as engaged in "punishment of the chief instigator," ultimately being reevaluated as a symbol of Korean resistance against Japanese aggressors.[^56]

**Question of Effectiveness:**

Some historians question whether An's assassination achieved its intended goals. Far from slowing Japan's progress toward complete control of Korea, the annexation process continued on the same track after Itō's death, culminating in the formal annexation just five months later.[^57] Critics argue that the assassination provided Japan with additional justification for tightening control over Korea and may have eliminated a voice for relatively moderate policies within the Japanese government.

**Ethical Concerns:**

Even among those sympathetic to Korean independence, some express discomfort with celebrating political assassination as a method of resistance. They argue that glorifying An's actions might encourage contemporary political violence. Others counter that judging An's actions by contemporary standards fails to account for the extreme circumstances of colonial oppression and the limited options available to Korean resisters.

**Collateral Damage:**

An's attack also injured several other Japanese officials who were not primary targets, raising questions about the indiscriminate nature of the assault. While these injuries were not fatal, they represent a morally ambiguous aspect of the assassination that is often overlooked in hagiographic accounts.

Despite these controversies, it is notable that an increasing number of Japanese scholars are reinterpreting the incident with a fresh outlook based on historical circumstances of the time.[^58] At a 2010 symposium in Korea, Japanese activist and scholar Wada Haruki quoted fellow historian Itō Yukio of Kyoto University, who argued that Itō Hirobumi's reign resulted in strong resistance from Koreans as it was considered the first step toward annexation, and that An should not be blamed even if he assassinated Itō without fully understanding Itō's ideology.[^59]

## Personal Life

An Junggeun's personal life was marked by the tension between family obligations and his dedication to Korean independence. His wife was Kim A-ryeo, with whom he had two sons according to some sources, while other accounts mention he had three sons and one daughter: An Sung-nyeo, An Jung-geun, An Gong-geun, and An Tae-hoon.[^60]

An spent most of his married life separated from his family due to his independence activities. He often wrote letters to his wife expressing his apologies and affection for her, acknowledging the hardship his activism caused the family.[^61] The tragedy of their separation was epitomized when Kim A-ryeo and their children traveled to Harbin to see An after the assassination, arriving the day after the shooting when he had already been taken into custody. They never saw each other again.[^62]

An's Catholic faith remained central to his identity throughout his life. He maintained his religious beliefs until his death, even requesting in his last letter to his wife that his son become a priest.[^63] This deep faith informed his worldview and his sense of justice, providing a moral framework for his political actions. His baptismal name, Thomas, connected him to the apostle known for his initial doubts but ultimate conviction—a parallel that An himself may have found meaningful.

An's mother, Jo Maria (조마리아) of the Baecheon Jo clan (1862-1927), was also a devout Catholic.[^64] She supported her son's activities and sent him traditional Korean white funeral clothing to wear at his execution, a final maternal gesture that honored both Korean tradition and her son's approaching martyrdom.[^65]

An Junggeun's youngest son, An Jun-saeng, later became a prominent businessman and Chinilpa (친일파, a collaborator with Japanese colonial authorities) during the Japanese occupation of Korea, a tragic irony given his father's sacrifice.[^66] An Jun-saeng died in 1952 from tuberculosis, and his children subsequently immigrated to the United States after the Korean War.[^67]

Kim Gu's recollections provide insight into An's personality as a young man. He was described as someone who preferred roaming the mountains with hunters to his studies, demonstrating his adventurous and independent spirit from an early age.[^68] His excellent marksmanship, love of reading, and strong charisma made him a natural leader.[^69] These personal qualities would later serve him well in his role as a lieutenant general in the independence army.

## Legacy

An Junggeun's legacy transcends his brief life, making him one of the most enduring symbols of Korean resistance to Japanese colonialism. He is remembered as a martyr in both South and North Korea, representing rare common ground between the two divided nations.[^70]

**South Korean Recognition:**

In 1962, the South Korean government posthumously awarded An the Order of Merit for National Foundation, the most prestigious civil decoration in the Republic of Korea.[^71] A memorial service is held each year on the anniversary of his death.[^72] In South Korea, he is revered as a national hero—a symbol of resistance, sacrifice, and unwavering patriotism. Schools, museums, and even currency have commemorated his image and achievements.[^73]

The An Jung-geun Memorial Hall was established in Seoul on October 26, 1970, under the direction of President Park Chung-hee and through public donations, commemorating the 60th anniversary of his death.[^74] In 2010, the old hanok-style building was demolished and replaced with a striking contemporary structure featuring twelve wide columns lit day and night, representing An and the eleven members of the Dongui Danjihoe who cut off their fingertips together.[^75] The memorial hall displays several pieces of his calligraphy and prison writings, allowing visitors to connect with his intellectual and artistic legacy.[^76]

**International Recognition:**

In 2014, China opened a memorial hall dedicated to An at Harbin Railway Station, the site of the assassination.[^77] This memorial was built with the joint endorsement of the South Korean and Chinese governments, though it was strongly objected to by the Japanese government.[^78] Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang stated at a press conference: "Ahn Jung-geun is, in history, an upholder of justice who fought against Japan's aggression."[^79] The memorial reflects China's own struggles against Japanese imperialism and its recognition of An as a hero who resisted Japanese expansion into Chinese territory.

**Scholarly Interest:**

Modern scholarship has increasingly focused on An's political philosophy, particularly his unfinished treatise "On Peace in East Asia," rather than solely on the assassination. An's treatise sparked greater interest following the publication of academic works about him, and he began to attract attention as an ideologist and political thinker, not merely an activist.[^80] His vision of Pan-Asian cooperation has been compared to the European Union and analyzed as an early articulation of regional integration theory.[^81]

Korean scholars have noted that while Ahn's assassination of Ito Hirobumi is heavily emphasized in Korean collective memory, his ultimate goal of bringing peace to Northeast Asia is often overlooked.[^82] This observation has led to renewed academic interest in his political writings and vision for the region.

**Cultural Impact:**

An Junggeun has been depicted in numerous films, television dramas, books, and works of art. His story continues to inspire contemporary Korean culture, appearing in everything from historical dramas to popular media. In 2024, a film titled "Harbin" was released, bringing his story to a new generation.[^83]

His calligraphy works have become highly valued cultural artifacts. In recent auctions, his calligraphic pieces have broken records, with one work selling for $976,000 in 2010.[^84] These works are treasured not only for their historical significance but also for their artistic and philosophical content.

**Diplomatic Significance:**

An Junggeun remains a sensitive figure in East Asian diplomacy. His legacy reflects broader tensions over historical memory and colonial legacies among Korea, Japan, and China. The 2014 controversy over the Harbin memorial demonstrates how his memory continues to influence contemporary international relations in Northeast Asia.[^85] South Korean President Park Geun-hye's request to Chinese President Xi Jinping to install a memorial, and China's enthusiastic response, illustrated how An's legacy can be mobilized in current geopolitical contexts.[^86]

**Symbol of Resistance:**

Beyond specific policies and commemorations, An Junggeun has become a universal symbol of resistance against imperialism and colonialism. His willingness to sacrifice his life for his principles, his maintenance of dignity under imprisonment, and his intellectual productivity even while awaiting execution have made him an inspirational figure far beyond Korea. His final message—that he would continue to work for Korean independence even from heaven—encapsulates the indomitable spirit that has made him an enduring hero.[^87]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians who view An Junggeun positively emphasize his role as a patriot, independence fighter, and visionary thinker who sacrificed his life for his country's freedom.

**Korean Nationalist Perspective:**

Within Korea, An is almost universally celebrated as a hero who stood up to imperial aggression when his country had lost its sovereignty. Historians emphasize that he acted not as a criminal but as a soldier in a war of independence. His declaration that he should be treated as a prisoner of war under international law is seen as a sophisticated understanding of his legal status and the legitimacy of armed resistance to occupation.[^88]

Korean scholars highlight the fifteen crimes An enumerated against Itō Hirobumi, arguing that these charges accurately reflected the systematic destruction of Korean sovereignty and the suffering inflicted on the Korean people. From this perspective, An's action was not terrorism but justified resistance—even tyrannicide in the classical tradition of removing an unjust ruler.[^89]

**Catholic and Moral Framework:**

An's deep Catholic faith has led to discussions about his canonization. Some Korean Catholics have urged the Church to consider him for sainthood, viewing his actions as morally justified resistance to evil.[^90] His maintenance of religious faith until his execution, his request that his son become a priest, and his expressions of forgiveness toward his captors are seen as evidence of genuine spiritual conviction, not mere political posturing.

**Visionary Political Thinker:**

Modern scholars increasingly appreciate An's "On Peace in East Asia" as a sophisticated work of political philosophy. Professor Sasagawa Norikatsu of Meiji University and other academics have praised An's vision of East Asian cooperation as prescient, comparing it favorably to the European Union concept and noting that it preceded the League of Nations by a decade.[^91] This perspective views An not merely as an assassin but as a thoughtful political theorist who understood that lasting peace in Asia required cooperative structures among China, Korea, and Japan.

His proposals for combined armed forces and joint currency demonstrate an understanding of regional integration that was remarkably advanced for his time. Scholars who emphasize this aspect of An's legacy argue that his intellectual contributions have been overshadowed by focus on the assassination itself.[^92]

**Chinese Solidarity:**

Chinese historians and political leaders have consistently praised An Junggeun as a hero who fought against Japanese imperialism, which threatened both Korea and China. The poems written by Yuan Shikai, Sun Yat-sen, and Liang Qichao immediately after the assassination demonstrate contemporary Chinese recognition of An's action as resistance to a common enemy.[^93] Modern Chinese official statements, such as Foreign Ministry spokesperson Qin Gang's declaration that An was "an upholder of justice who fought against Japan's aggression," continue this tradition.[^94]

**Inspiration to Independence Movements:**

Historians note that while An's assassination did not prevent Korea's annexation, it provided crucial inspiration to the Korean independence movement throughout the 35-year occupation. His willingness to sacrifice his life demonstrated that Korean resistance continued despite overwhelming odds. This symbolic value may have been more significant than any immediate political or military impact.[^95]

### Negative Views

Critics of An Junggeun focus on the ethics of political assassination, questions about the effectiveness of his actions, and concerns about glorifying violence.

**Japanese Criticism:**

Japanese scholars and officials maintain that An committed an act of terrorism by assassinating a government official engaged in diplomatic activity. They argue that Itō Hirobumi, whatever his role in Korea, was a legitimate representative of the Japanese government and that killing him was criminal murder, not warfare. The Japanese perspective emphasizes that An violated international law by carrying out an assassination on Chinese territory and that his action cannot be justified by his political motives.[^96]

Some Japanese historians have argued that Itō actually represented a relatively moderate faction within the Japanese government and that his death removed a potential restraining influence on more aggressive elements. From this perspective, the assassination may have inadvertently accelerated Korea's annexation rather than prevented it.[^97]

**Ethical Questions About Political Violence:**

Some international scholars, while sympathetic to Korean independence, question whether political assassination can be morally justified. They argue that celebrating An's actions sets a dangerous precedent that might encourage contemporary political violence. These critics distinguish between collective armed resistance (which they may support) and individual acts of assassination (which they view as morally problematic regardless of motive).[^98]

**Ineffectiveness Argument:**

Historians who emphasize pragmatic outcomes note that An's assassination failed to achieve its stated goals. Korea was annexed five months later, and the assassination provided Japan with additional justification for tightening control. From this perspective, An's action was a noble but ultimately futile gesture that may have actually harmed the independence cause.[^99]

**Simplification of History:**

Some scholars worry that the heroic narrative surrounding An Junggeun oversimplifies the complex history of Japanese-Korean relations and the varied responses to colonialism. They argue that excessive focus on An's dramatic action draws attention away from other forms of resistance—cultural, economic, diplomatic—that may have been more sustainable and effective in the long term.[^100]

**Religious Concerns:**

Within the Catholic Church, there is debate about whether An's action of assassination can be reconciled with Catholic teaching on the sanctity of life and the prohibition against murder. While some view him as a martyr, others argue that the Church's traditional just war theory and prohibition against tyrannicide make it problematic to celebrate his actions, regardless of his personal piety.[^101]

**Diplomatic Complications:**

Modern critics note that continued veneration of An Junggeun complicates contemporary Japanese-Korean relations. They argue that while historical memory is important, excessive focus on the colonial period prevents the two nations from developing a forward-looking relationship. This perspective views commemoration of An as politically understandable but diplomatically unhelpful.[^102]

Despite these criticisms, it is significant that even some Japanese scholars have begun to reassess An's actions in historical context. Wada Haruki and others have argued for understanding An's assassination within the framework of Korean resistance to colonialism, suggesting a more nuanced view that transcends simple condemnation.[^103]
