## Summary

Kishore Biyani was known as the pioneer of modern retail in India. He founded Future Group, which operated Big Bazaar (India's first hypermarket), Pantaloons, and other retail chains. At its peak, Future Group was India's largest domestic retailer. However, the empire collapsed under debt, and Future Group's retail assets were acquired by Reliance Retail in 2022 in a controversial deal that also involved Amazon's objections.
