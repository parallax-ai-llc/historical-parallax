## Summary

Sir Thomas More (1478-1535) was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman, and noted Renaissance humanist who served as Lord Chancellor to King Henry VIII. He is best known for his refusal to acknowledge Henry VIII as Supreme Head of the Church of England and his execution for treason, which led to his canonization as a saint and martyr by the Catholic Church in 1935. More wrote the influential political satire "Utopia" (1516), which coined the term and concept that has shaped political philosophy for centuries. His life represents the fundamental conflict between individual conscience and state authority, making him a symbol of moral integrity and religious conviction.

## Early Life and Background

Thomas More was born on February 7, 1478, in Milk Street, London, the son of Sir John More, a successful lawyer and judge, and Agnes Graunger[^1]. He grew up in a prosperous household that valued education and legal training, setting the foundation for his future career. His father, a prominent figure in London's legal community, ensured that young Thomas received an excellent education befitting a gentleman destined for public service[^2].

At around age twelve, More was placed in the household of John Morton, Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England, where he served as a page[^3]. This experience provided him with invaluable exposure to the highest levels of English politics and church administration. Morton recognized the boy's exceptional intelligence and wit, reportedly predicting that he would become "a marvellous man"[^4].

More attended St. Anthony's School in Threadneedle Street, London, one of the finest schools in the city, where he received a classical education in Latin and rhetoric[^5]. Around 1492, he entered Oxford University, studying at Canterbury College (later absorbed into Christ Church), where he was exposed to the new humanist learning that was transforming European intellectual life[^6]. At Oxford, More studied under renowned scholars and developed his mastery of Latin and Greek, as well as his passion for classical literature and philosophy.

After two years at Oxford, his father called him back to London to begin legal training, concerned that his son was becoming too absorbed in academic pursuits at the expense of practical career preparation[^7]. More entered New Inn in 1494 and then Lincoln's Inn in 1496, one of the prestigious Inns of Court where English lawyers received their education[^8]. He proved an outstanding student of law, demonstrating the analytical skills and rhetorical ability that would later make him one of England's most formidable legal minds.

During his legal training, More maintained his humanist studies and even contemplated a religious vocation. Between 1503 and 1504, he lived near the Carthusian monastery at the London Charterhouse, participating in the monks' spiritual disciplines while continuing his legal work[^9]. This period of spiritual discernment profoundly influenced his religious identity, though he ultimately chose secular life and marriage over monastic vows. Throughout his life, More maintained rigorous personal religious practices, including wearing a hair shirt and engaging in regular fasting and prayer[^10].

## Rise to Power

More's professional ascent began in earnest when he was elected to Parliament in 1504, at approximately age 26[^11]. His first major political act demonstrated the independence and courage that would characterize his career: he spoke against King Henry VII's request for substantial tax increases, helping to reduce the demanded amount[^12]. This opposition to royal demands angered the king, and More's father was briefly imprisoned as a result, teaching the young lawyer the dangers of defying royal authority[^13].

After Henry VII's death in 1509, More's career flourished under the new king, Henry VIII. He quickly established himself as one of London's leading lawyers, representing merchants and building a lucrative practice[^14]. His reputation for integrity, learning, and eloquence brought him to the attention of powerful patrons, including Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII's chief minister[^15].

In 1510, More became one of the two undersheriffs of London, a position that involved significant judicial responsibilities and brought him into contact with the city's commercial elite[^16]. He served in this capacity with distinction, earning a reputation for fairness and incorruptibility that was rare among officials of the period[^17]. His friend Erasmus later wrote that More "acted with such efficiency and fairness that no judge was ever more highly respected"[^18].

More's intellectual reputation also grew during this period. His friendship with the great humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus, which began around 1499, placed him at the center of European humanist networks[^19]. When Erasmus stayed with More in 1509, he wrote "The Praise of Folly" (dedicated to More with a Latin pun on his name, "Moria")[^20]. More's own literary output included Latin epigrams, translations, and controversial works defending Catholic orthodoxy against Protestant reformers[^21].

The work that secured More's lasting intellectual legacy was "Utopia," published in Latin in 1516[^22]. This complex political satire, presented as a description of an ideal commonwealth on a fictional island, critiqued contemporary European society while exploring radical ideas about property, governance, and religious toleration[^23]. The book was an immediate success among European intellectuals and established More as a major figure in Renaissance humanism[^24].

More entered royal service in 1517, initially as a member of a diplomatic mission to Calais, and then as a royal councillor and personal assistant to Henry VIII[^25]. The king valued More's learning, wit, and administrative abilities, frequently summoning him for intellectual conversation and counsel[^26]. More was knighted in 1521 and appointed Under-Treasurer of the Exchequer[^27].

His ascent continued with appointments as Speaker of the House of Commons in 1523, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in 1525, and finally, in October 1529, Lord Chancellor of England[^28]. This last appointment made More the highest judicial officer in England and one of the king's principal advisors. Notably, More was the first layman to hold this position, which had traditionally been reserved for clergy[^29].

## Major Achievements

Thomas More's achievements span literature, philosophy, law, and statecraft, making him one of the most accomplished figures of the English Renaissance. His multifaceted legacy continues to influence political thought, legal principles, and religious discourse five centuries after his death.

More's greatest literary achievement was undoubtedly "Utopia" (1516), a work that created an entire genre of political literature and contributed a fundamental word to political vocabulary[^30]. Written in Latin and structured as a dialogue, the book describes a fictional island society with communal property, religious toleration, universal education, and rational governance[^31]. The work's complexity allows for multiple interpretations: it can be read as a serious philosophical proposal, a satirical critique of European society, or an exploration of the tensions between Christian ideals and political realities[^32]. "Utopia" influenced countless later political thinkers and writers, from Francis Bacon to Karl Marx, and established More as a major figure in the history of political philosophy[^33].

As a humanist scholar, More contributed significantly to the intellectual movement that sought to recover and apply classical learning to contemporary problems. He collaborated with Erasmus on translations of Lucian from Greek to Latin, demonstrating his mastery of classical languages[^34]. His humanist education informed his approach to law, governance, and education, and he advocated for the inclusion of women in classical learning, ensuring his own daughters received educations comparable to those of university-trained men[^35].

More's legal career was marked by exceptional skill and integrity. As a lawyer, he represented merchants in complex commercial cases, developing expertise in international trade law[^36]. His legal reasoning combined classical rhetorical training with practical knowledge of English common law, making him a formidable advocate[^37]. As undersheriff of London and later as Lord Chancellor, he administered justice with a reputation for fairness that was remarkable for the period[^38].

During his tenure as Lord Chancellor (1529-1532), More implemented important legal reforms and worked to make justice more accessible to ordinary people[^39]. He was known for hearing cases promptly and deciding them fairly, clearing backlogs that had accumulated under previous chancellors[^40]. His biographer William Roper recorded that More would sometimes sit in the Court of Chancery from morning until evening, ensuring that all who sought justice received a hearing[^41].

More also served Henry VIII effectively in diplomatic missions, representing English interests in negotiations with continental powers[^42]. His intelligence, linguistic abilities, and rhetorical skills made him a valuable diplomatic asset. He participated in several important embassies to Flanders and France, helping to navigate the complex European political landscape of the 1520s[^43].

As a religious controversialist, More wrote extensively against the Protestant Reformation, defending Catholic doctrine with learning, vigor, and sometimes vitriolic rhetoric[^44]. His polemical works against William Tyndale, Martin Luther, and other reformers filled thousands of pages and demonstrated his commitment to Catholic orthodoxy[^45]. While these controversial writings are among his least admired works today due to their harsh tone, they reveal the intensity of More's religious convictions and his skill as a theological debater[^46].

More's commitment to education extended beyond his own scholarly pursuits. He established a school in his household where his children and wards received classical educations[^47]. His educational philosophy emphasized moral formation alongside intellectual development, and his household became famous throughout Europe as a model of learned domesticity[^48]. Erasmus praised More's household as a "Platonic academy," where learning and virtue flourished together[^49].

Perhaps More's most significant achievement, at least in terms of his subsequent canonization and historical memory, was his principled stand against Henry VIII's break with Rome. When he resigned as Lord Chancellor in 1532 rather than support the king's ecclesiastical supremacy, and later refused to swear the Oath of Succession (which required acknowledging the annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and the royal supremacy over the church), More demonstrated extraordinary moral courage[^50]. His willingness to sacrifice his life rather than violate his conscience established him as a symbol of integrity and principled resistance to tyranny[^51].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his reputation for integrity and learning, Thomas More's career and character include deeply troubling aspects that complicate his legacy. Modern scholars and historians have increasingly scrutinized his actions, particularly regarding religious persecution, and found serious moral failings alongside his celebrated virtues.

The most serious criticism of More concerns his treatment of heretics during his time as Lord Chancellor. More actively persecuted Protestants and suspected heretics, using his authority to imprison, interrogate, and in some cases, condemn reformers to death by burning[^52]. At least six people were burned at the stake for heresy during More's chancellorship, and he personally interrogated suspected heretics, sometimes in his own house[^53]. While More later denied allegations that he tortured heretics in his home, substantial evidence suggests he was intimately involved in the suppression of religious dissent[^54].

More's polemical writings against Protestant reformers contain shocking levels of vitriol and crude language, revealing a side of his character at odds with his reputation for humanist civility[^55]. In his controversies against William Tyndale, Martin Luther, and others, More employed scatological insults, personal attacks, and rhetoric that modern readers find disturbing[^56]. He described reformers as "hell-hounds," "dung," and worse, suggesting that religious disagreement triggered in him a rage that overwhelmed his humanist sensibilities[^57].

The contradiction between More's advocacy for religious toleration in "Utopia" and his persecution of heretics as Lord Chancellor has troubled scholars for centuries[^58]. In "Utopia," More described a society where religious diversity was permitted and religious coercion was forbidden, yet as a royal official, he vigorously enforced religious conformity[^59]. Defenders argue that More distinguished between theoretical speculation in literature and practical governance, or that "Utopia" was satirical rather than prescriptive, but the tension remains unresolved[^60].

More's relationship with Henry VIII has also drawn criticism. Some historians argue that More served the king too long and too well, lending his considerable talents and reputation to a regime that was already showing signs of tyranny before the break with Rome[^61]. More assisted Henry in writing against Luther in 1521, helped suppress Protestant writings, and generally supported royal authority until the moment it conflicted with papal supremacy[^62]. Critics suggest that More's later martyrdom should not obscure his earlier complicity in royal absolutism[^63].

His treatment of his family during his final imprisonment has been questioned by some scholars. More's determination to maintain his principles meant impoverishment and social disgrace for his wife and children[^64]. While defenders praise his integrity, critics note that his family paid a heavy price for his conscience, and that he showed limited concern for their material welfare when balancing it against his religious convictions[^65].

More's attitudes toward women, despite his progressive views on female education, reflected conventional patriarchal assumptions of his era[^66]. While he ensured his daughters received excellent educations, he maintained traditional views about women's subordinate social roles and their primary responsibilities as wives and mothers[^67]. Some feminist scholars argue that More's educational reforms for women were ultimately intended to make them better companions for educated men rather than to promote genuine equality[^68].

The economic and social conservatism of More's later years also draws criticism. As he grew older and more powerful, More became increasingly attached to hierarchy, order, and tradition[^69]. His early radicalism in "Utopia," with its critique of private property and exploration of communal living, gave way to defense of established social structures and resistance to change[^70]. Some historians see this as a betrayal of his youthful idealism, while others view it as a natural evolution toward realism and responsibility[^71].

More's legacy has been appropriated by various political and religious movements in ways that distort his actual views and actions. Catholics have celebrated him as a martyr for the faith, while sometimes minimizing his persecution of Protestants[^72]. Conversely, secular liberals have claimed him as a champion of conscience and individual rights, overlooking his religious intolerance[^73]. This contested legacy reflects the genuine contradictions in More's life and thought rather than simple misunderstanding[^74].

## Personal Life

Thomas More married Jane Colt in 1505, when he was approximately 27 years old and she was much younger, possibly in her teens[^75]. According to More's friend Erasmus, More had initially been attracted to Jane's younger sister, but chose Jane out of consideration for her feelings, not wanting the elder daughter to suffer the embarrassment of being passed over[^76]. The marriage appears to have been happy, and Jane bore More four children: Margaret, Elizabeth, Cecily, and John[^77]. Jane died in 1511, possibly from complications of childbirth or disease[^78].

Within a month of Jane's death, More married Alice Middleton, a widow several years his senior[^79]. This hasty remarriage was practical rather than romantic—More needed someone to manage his household and care for his young children[^80]. Alice was reportedly sharp-tongued, practical, and not particularly interested in More's intellectual pursuits, leading to affectionate but sometimes tense interactions[^81]. More's biographers record his jokes at Alice's expense, though their relationship appears to have been fundamentally solid and characterized by mutual respect despite their different temperaments[^82].

More was devoted to his children, particularly his eldest daughter Margaret, who became an accomplished scholar in her own right[^83]. Margaret learned Latin, Greek, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy, and her learning was celebrated throughout Europe[^84]. The correspondence between More and Margaret during his imprisonment reveals deep affection and shared intellectual and spiritual values[^85]. More's other daughters also received educations that were exceptional for women of the period, and More defended female learning against critics who considered it inappropriate or dangerous[^86].

More's household in Chelsea became famous as a center of learning and piety. He moved his family to a large house in Chelsea around 1524, where he created an extended household that included his children, their spouses, wards, and foster children[^87]. The household was governed by regular religious observances, including daily prayer and Bible reading, and More maintained strict moral discipline while encouraging intellectual pursuits[^88]. Visitors to the Chelsea household, including Erasmus and Hans Holbein, marveled at the combination of learning, piety, and family warmth they encountered[^89].

More's personal religious practices were austere. He wore a hair shirt next to his skin as an act of mortification, a practice his family discovered only when preparing his body for burial[^90]. He slept on a wooden plank with a log for a pillow, fasted regularly, and devoted several hours each day to prayer[^91]. Despite these severe personal disciplines, More maintained a reputation for cheerfulness, wit, and good humor in social settings[^92].

His love of animals and nature was well documented. More kept a small menagerie at Chelsea, including a monkey, and maintained gardens where he would walk and converse with family and friends[^93]. He enjoyed music and encouraged its practice in his household[^94]. These softer aspects of his personality balanced his reputation for intellectual rigor and religious severity.

More's sense of humor was legendary. He was famous for puns, jokes, and witty observations that delighted contemporaries[^95]. Even at his trial and execution, More maintained his characteristic wit—when ascending the scaffold, he reportedly joked with the lieutenant about its weakness, saying "I pray you, Master Lieutenant, see me safe up, and for my coming down let me shift for myself"[^96]. His ability to combine deep seriousness about fundamental matters with levity about life's everyday concerns was a distinctive aspect of his personality[^97].

## Legacy

Thomas More's execution on July 6, 1535, transformed him from a failed politician into an enduring symbol of conscience and moral integrity. His last words on the scaffold—declaring himself "the King's good servant, but God's first"—encapsulated the principle for which he died and established the terms of his subsequent remembrance[^98].

The Catholic Church recognized More's martyrdom relatively quickly in historical terms. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1886 and canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1935, exactly 400 years after his execution[^99]. In 2000, Pope John Paul II declared More the patron saint of statesmen and politicians, cementing his status as a model for Catholic engagement in public life[^100]. For Catholics, More represents the supreme example of fidelity to conscience and religious truth even unto death, a man who chose eternal salvation over temporal power and comfort[^101].

Beyond religious circles, More's legacy as a defender of conscience against state tyranny has resonated across centuries and ideologies. He has been claimed as a hero by liberals, conservatives, secularists, and believers, each group emphasizing different aspects of his stand against Henry VIII[^102]. The fundamental principle he embodied—that individuals have a right and duty to resist unjust authority when it violates fundamental moral or religious convictions—has influenced political thought and resistance movements worldwide[^103].

"Utopia" remains More's most influential intellectual legacy. The work established a literary genre—the utopian novel—that has included works by Francis Bacon, Tommaso Campanella, and countless others[^104]. More importantly, the concept of "utopia" itself became a fundamental category of political thought, representing both the visionary imagination that critiques existing society and the dangerous fantasy of perfect social engineering[^105]. Political philosophers, revolutionaries, and reformers have all engaged with More's text, finding in it inspiration, warning, or both[^106].

More's contribution to humanist education, particularly his advocacy for female learning, influenced educational theory and practice. His household school at Chelsea demonstrated that women could master classical languages and philosophy, challenging assumptions about female intellectual capacity[^107]. While his views remained within patriarchal frameworks, his practical example inspired other humanists to educate their daughters and contributed to gradual expansion of educational opportunities for women[^108].

In English legal history, More is remembered as an exemplar of judicial integrity and as an important Lord Chancellor who advanced equity jurisprudence[^109]. His reputation for hearing cases fairly and efficiently, refusing bribes, and making justice accessible to ordinary people established standards for judicial conduct that influenced subsequent legal development[^110]. The legal profession in England has long honored More as a model of professional ethics and commitment to justice[^111].

More's legacy has been preserved and transmitted through numerous artistic and literary works. Hans Holbein's portrait of More, painted around 1527, became one of the most iconic images of the Renaissance, presenting More as the ideal humanist statesman—learned, dignified, and morally serious[^112]. Robert Bolt's 1960 play "A Man for All Seasons," later adapted into an Academy Award-winning film, introduced More to modern audiences as a hero of individual conscience, though the play's interpretation has been criticized as anachronistic[^113].

The physical sites associated with More's life have become places of pilgrimage and remembrance. The Tower of London, where More was imprisoned and from which he went to his execution, includes exhibitions about his final months[^114]. The Church of St. Dunstan in Canterbury houses More's head, buried there after being displayed on London Bridge[^115]. These sites connect contemporary visitors to More's story and keep his memory alive in tangible ways[^116].

More's legacy remains contested and complex. For some, he represents moral heroism and the triumph of conscience; for others, he embodies religious intolerance and the dangers of absolute conviction[^117]. This contested legacy reflects genuine contradictions in More's life—he was simultaneously a champion of certain freedoms and a persecutor of those who exercised religious freedom differently than he approved[^118]. Rather than resolving these contradictions, More's legacy forces continuing engagement with fundamental questions about conscience, authority, toleration, and the limits of political obligation[^119].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers have praised Thomas More across centuries for his intellectual achievements, moral courage, and principled resistance to tyranny. His canonization by the Catholic Church in 1935 represented official recognition of his status as a martyr and saint, but appreciation for More extends far beyond Catholic circles[^120].

Historians of Renaissance humanism celebrate More as one of the movement's most accomplished figures. "Utopia" is recognized as a masterwork of political philosophy that combined classical learning, social criticism, and imaginative speculation in ways that influenced political thought for centuries[^121]. Scholar Quentin Skinner argues that More's humanism represented the highest achievement of civic humanist thought in England, applying classical wisdom to contemporary political problems[^122]. More's mastery of Latin and Greek, his friendships with leading European intellectuals like Erasmus, and his contributions to humanist scholarship established him as a major figure in the intellectual transformation of early modern Europe[^123].

More's stand against Henry VIII has been interpreted by many scholars as an early assertion of individual conscience against state absolutism, making him a forerunner of modern ideas about human rights and religious freedom[^124]. Political philosopher Michael Walzer includes More among historical examples of legitimate resistance to unjust authority[^125]. The principle that individuals must sometimes refuse to obey even legitimate rulers when commanded to violate fundamental moral convictions has been seen as a crucial foundation for later developments in political theory and practice[^126].

Legal historians praise More's tenure as Lord Chancellor for advancing principles of equity and justice. His reputation for fairness, accessibility, and integrity established standards for judicial conduct that influenced English legal culture[^127]. Professor John Guy, a leading More scholar, argues that More's legal reforms and judicial practice represented important steps toward making English law more rational and humane[^128]. More's refusal to accept bribes and his commitment to hearing cases from poor as well as rich litigants distinguished him from many contemporary officials and established him as a model of judicial virtue[^129].

More's educational legacy, particularly his advancement of female learning, has been recognized by scholars as progressive for his era. His daughter Margaret's scholarly achievements demonstrated the viability of classical education for women and inspired other humanists to educate their daughters[^130]. Historian Margaret L. King argues that More's household school represented an important early challenge to assumptions about women's intellectual capacities[^131].

Religious scholars, particularly but not exclusively Catholic ones, view More as an exemplar of faith and devotion. His willingness to sacrifice wealth, power, and ultimately life rather than compromise his religious convictions represents the highest standard of religious integrity[^132]. Theologian Alasdair MacIntyre presents More as a model of how religious commitment can inform and elevate political life, arguing that More's example demonstrates the necessity of transcendent moral reference points in public affairs[^133].

Contemporary admirers emphasize More's relevance to modern dilemmas. Pope John Paul II, in declaring More the patron saint of statesmen and politicians in 2000, argued that More's example provides essential guidance for navigating conflicts between political expedience and moral principle[^134]. More's famous statement that he died "the King's good servant, but God's first" has been invoked by those seeking to articulate proper relationships between political loyalty and higher moral commitments[^135].

### Negative Views

Critical scholars have increasingly scrutinized Thomas More's actions and character, finding serious moral failings that complicate his reputation as a hero of conscience and toleration. The most serious criticisms focus on his persecution of heretics, religious intolerance, and the contradictions between his professed principles and his conduct in office.

Historian Richard Marius, in his comprehensive biography of More, presents a deeply critical assessment, arguing that More's persecution of Protestant reformers reveals a cruel and authoritarian streak fundamentally at odds with his humanist reputation[^136]. Marius documents More's active role in hunting down, imprisoning, and condemning heretics, noting that at least six people were burned alive during More's chancellorship with his direct involvement[^137]. This historical evidence, Marius argues, contradicts the sanitized image of More as a gentle martyr and reveals him as a religious fanatic willing to use violence against those who disagreed with him[^138].

The contradiction between the religious toleration advocated in "Utopia" and More's later persecution of heretics has been identified by numerous scholars as a fundamental hypocrisy. Historian Brendan Bradshaw argues that More's conduct as Lord Chancellor betrayed the principles of humanist toleration he had earlier articulated[^139]. Literary scholar Stephen Greenblatt suggests that "Utopia" may have been a rhetorical exercise rather than a genuine statement of More's convictions, or alternatively, that More's later experiences led him to abandon his earlier idealism for harsh authoritarianism[^140].

More's polemical writings against Protestant reformers have damaged his reputation among scholars who find the crude language and personal attacks incompatible with humanist civility. Professor Eamon Duffy notes that More's controversial works contain "scatological abuse" and "bilious invective" that shock modern readers and reveal an intolerant mindset[^141]. These writings suggest that religious disagreement triggered in More a rage that overwhelmed his judgment and his humanist principles of reasoned dialogue[^142].

Feminist scholars have critiqued More's patriarchal assumptions despite his support for female education. While acknowledging his progressive educational practices, historians like Shannon McSheffrey argue that More's educational philosophy ultimately reinforced rather than challenged gender hierarchies, preparing women to be better wives and mothers rather than autonomous individuals[^143]. More's own writings about women often employed conventional misogynistic tropes, undermining his reputation as an advocate for female learning[^144].

Some historians question whether More's martyrdom represented genuine principle or stubborn pride. Revisionist interpretations suggest that More's refusal to swear the Oath of Succession may have stemmed partly from personal animosity toward Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell rather than purely from religious conviction[^145]. Geoffrey Elton argued that More's stand against Henry VIII was ultimately about ecclesiastical politics and papal authority rather than fundamental individual conscience, making him less admirable than hagiographic accounts suggest[^146].

More's service to Henry VIII before their final break has been criticized as complicity in tyranny. Historian G.R. Elton points out that More willingly served a king whose authoritarian tendencies were already evident, assisted in suppressing Protestant writings and ideas, and only broke with Henry when the king's policies threatened Catholic doctrine and papal supremacy[^147]. This suggests that More's principles were more limited and sectarian than his later reputation as a champion of conscience implies[^148].

The cost of More's martyrdom for his family has troubled some scholars. His determination to maintain his principles meant financial ruin, social disgrace, and suffering for his wife, children, and extended household who depended on him[^149]. While defenders praise his integrity, critics argue that he showed insufficient concern for his dependents' welfare when measured against his own religious convictions, suggesting a self-centered rigidity rather than genuine moral heroism[^150].

Contemporary scholars increasingly emphasize the need for a balanced assessment that acknowledges both More's achievements and his serious moral failings. Historian Peter Ackroyd argues that More must be understood as a man of his time, neither the plaster saint of Catholic hagiography nor the tolerant humanist of secular legend, but a complex, contradictory figure whose legacy includes both admirable and troubling elements[^151].
