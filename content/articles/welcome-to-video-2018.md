## Overview

"Welcome to Video" was the largest child sexual abuse material (CSAM) site in the world, hosted on the Dark Web (Tor). It had over 1 million registered users and stored 8 terabytes of horrific videos.
**The Operator:**
Shockingly, the mastermind was **Son Jong-woo**, a 22-year-old living in a unremarkable house in South Korea.
**The Investigation:**
IRS-CI (Criminal Investigation) agents in the US traced the Bitcoin transactions used to pay for videos. They realized the blockchain is public. By de-anonymizing the flow of money, they located the server in South Korea.

## The Sentence Controversy

Son was arrested in 2018.
In the US, users of the site were getting 15-year prison sentences.
In South Korea, Son Jong-woo was sentenced to **18 months in prison**.
The US demanded his extradition to face money laundering charges (and a likely life sentence).
The South Korean court **refused extradition**, claiming they needed him to "fight crimes" in Korea. He was released in 2020.
This sparked international outrage and massive protests in Korea against the leniency of sex crime laws.
