## Summary

Carl David Anderson was an American physicist who won the 1936 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the positron, the first known antiparticle. He made this discovery using a cloud chamber to study cosmic rays. He also co-discovered the muon in 1936 with Seth Neddermeyer. Anderson's work provided experimental confirmation of Paul Dirac's theoretical prediction of antimatter.
