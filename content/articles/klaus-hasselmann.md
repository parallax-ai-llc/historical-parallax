## Summary

Klaus Hasselmann is a German physicist and oceanographer who shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Physics for the physical modelling of Earth's climate. He developed methods to identify the fingerprint of human influence on climate change, proving that global warming is caused by human CO2 emissions. His stochastic climate model connected weather variability to climate change.
