## Summary

Gregory of Sinai was a Byzantine monk who was one of the most important figures in the Hesychast movement. He traveled to Mount Sinai, Palestine, Crete, and Mount Athos, and finally settled in Bulgaria, where he founded the Paroria monastery. He systematized the practice of Hesychasm — the contemplative prayer tradition of the Jesus Prayer and the seeking of inner stillness. His teachings influenced the Hesychast movement that was endorsed by the councils in support of Gregory Palamas.
