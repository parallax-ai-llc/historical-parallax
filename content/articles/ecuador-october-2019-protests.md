## Summary

In October 2019, Indigenous Ecuadorians did what they had done before: they marched on Quito and brought down a president's policy. For 11 days, the country convulsed as hundreds of thousands protested the government's decision to cut fuel subsidies—a move demanded by the International Monetary Fund in exchange for a $4.2 billion loan. The Indigenous movement, led by CONAIE, occupied the capital, and President Lenín Moreno fled to the coastal city of Guayaquil.[^1]

The protests were a textbook example of successful mass mobilization forcing policy reversal. Fuel prices had doubled overnight when Moreno issued Decree 883, eliminating subsidies that had kept gasoline affordable for decades. Transport workers struck first, then the Indigenous confederations joined, transforming a bread-and-butter issue into a confrontation over who Ecuador belonged to—the people or the IMF.[^2]

By October 13, after televised negotiations between the government and Indigenous leaders, Moreno agreed to withdraw the decree and restore the subsidies. The movement had won. But 11 people were dead, over 1,300 injured, and 1,192 detained. The victory was real but incomplete: the underlying economic crisis remained, and the question of how Ecuador would pay its debts was only postponed, not resolved.[^3]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did Protesters Win?

**Indigenous organization:**

- CONAIE has deep roots
- Can mobilize nationwide
- History of victories

**Urban-rural alliance:**

- Transport workers + Indigenous
- Middle class sympathized
- Government isolated

**Government weakness:**

- Moreno unpopular
- Military didn't want bloodbath
- International watching

### Why Did It Happen?

**Immediate:**

- Fuel price shock
- No consultation
- IMF conditionality

**Structural:**

- Inequality
- Colonial legacy
- Extractive economy
- Indigenous marginalization

### Comparison to Other 2019 Protests

| Country     | Trigger            | Deaths | Outcome                |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------- |
| Chile       | Metro fare         | 30+    | Constitutional process |
| **Ecuador** | **Fuel subsidies** | **11** | **Policy reversed**    |
| Colombia    | Various            | 5+     | Limited gains          |
| Bolivia     | Election fraud     | 35     | President ousted       |

**Ecuador's protests were among the most successful in forcing immediate policy reversal.**[^11]
