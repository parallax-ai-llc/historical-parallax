## Summary

Mahmoud Mohamed Taha was a Sudanese Islamic reformer who developed a revolutionary hermeneutic for the Quran. He distinguished between the universal Meccan revelations and the historically specific Medinan legislation, arguing that modern Islamic law should be based on the former. He opposed Nimeiry's implementation of sharia in Sudan and was executed for apostasy at age 76. His 'Second Message of Islam' continues to inspire Islamic reformers.
