## Summary

The Wright Brothers, Orville (1871-1948) and Wilbur (1867-1912), were American inventors and aviation pioneers who built and flew the first successful powered airplane. Their December 17, 1903 flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, lasted 12 seconds and covered 120 feet, marking the beginning of the age of powered flight. Their systematic approach to solving the problems of flight through wind tunnel testing and careful engineering set the standard for aviation development.
