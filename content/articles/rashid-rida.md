## Summary

Rashid Rida was a Syrian-born Islamic scholar and journalist who was the most prominent disciple of Muhammad Abduh. He published the influential journal al-Manar for over 35 years, spreading Islamic reform ideas across the Muslim world. He sought to reconcile Islamic tradition with modernity while opposing both Western secularism and popular Sufi practices. His later shift toward Salafism influenced the Muslim Brotherhood and modern Islamism.
