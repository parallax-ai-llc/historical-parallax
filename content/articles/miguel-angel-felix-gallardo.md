## Summary
Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, 'El Padrino' (The Godfather), was the founder of the Guadalajara Cartel and is considered the godfather of the modern Mexican drug trade. He controlled nearly all drug trafficking in Mexico and the corridor along the US-Mexico border until his arrest in 1989.

## Early Life
Born January 8, 1946, in Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico. He worked as a federal police officer and bodyguard for the governor of Sinaloa before entering the drug trade. His law enforcement connections proved invaluable. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Félix Gallardo unified Mexico's drug traffickers under the Guadalajara Cartel in the late 1970s. He controlled virtually all cocaine trafficking through Mexico and established the 'plaza' system, dividing territory among traffickers. His organization was responsible for the kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena in 1985. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
After the Camarena murder drew intense US pressure, Félix Gallardo was arrested on April 8, 1989. Before his arrest, he divided his territory among lieutenants — creating the Sinaloa, Tijuana, and Juárez cartels. He was convicted of drug trafficking and the Camarena murder. He remains in prison. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His organizational structure created the framework for modern cartel operations [^4]
- His arrest demonstrated that even the most powerful traffickers could be brought down
- His case improved US-Mexico drug enforcement cooperation

## Negative Perspectives
- Founded the first major Mexican drug trafficking organization [^5]
- His organization murdered DEA agent Kiki Camarena
- His territorial divisions created the cartels that wage war to this day
- Corrupted Mexican government and law enforcement
- His legacy includes decades of cartel violence
