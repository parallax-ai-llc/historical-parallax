## Overview

On the morning of July 7, 2005, four British Islamist men detonated homemade organic peroxide bombs (TATP) in central London. Three bombs exploded on Underground trains (Circle and Piccadilly lines) within 50 seconds of each other. An hour later, a fourth bomb exploded on a double-decker bus in Tavistock Square. The attack killed 52 people and injured over 700. It happened the day after London won the bid to host the 2012 Olympics, turning celebration into mourning.

## "Homegrown" Terror

Unlike 9/11 (foreign hijackers), the 7/7 bombers were British citizens (from Leeds and Aylesbury).
**Mohammad Sidique Khan:** The ringleader, a teaching assistant who had recorded a martyrdom video blaming the West for "bombing, gassing, imprisonment and torture of my people."
This shocked the UK: The threat was internal, not external.

## The Bus (Number 30)

Hasib Hussain, the fourth bomber, planned to take the Northern Line but it was suspended.
He boarded a bus instead.
He detonated his device at Tavistock Square. The roof of the bus was peeled back like a tin can. 13 people died on the bus.

## Impact

**"Keep Calm and Carry On":**
Londoners walked home. The city showed resilience.
**Surveillance:**
CCTV footage was crucial in tracking the bombers' movements (from Luton station to King's Cross). The UK expanded its already massive surveillance network.
