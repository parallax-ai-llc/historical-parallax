## Overview

The 1MDB (1Malaysia Development Berhad) scandal is one of the world's greatest financial heists.
**Jho Low**, a mild-mannered Malaysian financier, masterminded the looting of **$4.5 billion** from a sovereign wealth fund meant to help the Malaysian people.
With the help of Prime Minister **Najib Razak** (who had $700 million discovered in his personal bank account) and bankers from **Goldman Sachs**, the money was siphoned off.

## Where the Money Went

It wasn't just hidden; it was flaunted.
**Hollywood:** Jho Low funded the movie *The Wolf of Wall Street*. (Irony: Stolen money funded a movie about financial fraud). He partied with Leonard DiCaprio and gave him Picasso paintings.
**Luxury:**
- The Superyacht *Equanimity* ($250 million).
- A see-through grand piano for supermodel Miranda Kerr.
- Massive gambling debts in Vegas ($2 million in one night).

## The Fall

Journalist **Clare Rewcastle Brown** (Sarawak Report) and the WSJ broke the story.
Najib Razak fired the Attorney General to stop the investigation.
But in 2018, the Malaysian people voted him out (a historic shock). Police raided his apartments, seizing 284 boxes of designer handbags (Hermès Birkins) and $30 million in cash.
Najib was sentenced to 12 years in prison.
**Jho Low:** Remains a fugitive, believed to be hiding in China.
