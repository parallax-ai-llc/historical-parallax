## Summary

Li Liejun (李烈鈞, 1882-1946) was a prominent Chinese revolutionary leader and military general during the turbulent early Republican period of China. Born in Wuning, Jiangxi Province, he played crucial roles in the 1911 Revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty, led military opposition against Yuan Shikai's autocracy during the Second Revolution of 1913, and co-commanded the National Protection War (1915-1916) to prevent Yuan from becoming emperor[^1][^2]. Despite his dedication to preserving republican government, Li's military career was marked by both heroic resistance to authoritarianism and eventual complicity in the warlordism that fragmented China.

---

## Early Life and Background

Li Liejun was born on February 23, 1882, in Wuning County, Jiangxi Province, during the final decades of the Qing Dynasty[^3]. Little is recorded about his immediate family background, though his later receipt of a government scholarship suggests his family had sufficient standing to support his education. In 1904, the Qing government selected Li for a prestigious scholarship to study military science in Japan, sending him to the Tokyo Shimbu Gakko, a military preparatory academy[^4]. This opportunity marked a turning point in his life, exposing him to both modern military training and revolutionary ideas that were flourishing among Chinese students abroad.

In 1907, Li advanced to the artillery school of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, where he studied alongside future Chinese military leaders including Yan Xishan, Tang Jiyao, and Cheng Qian[^5]. These classmates would later become prominent warlords and political figures in Republican China. During his time in Japan, Li joined the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance), a secret society founded by Sun Yat-sen dedicated to overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and modernizing China[^6]. This revolutionary society became the primary organizational vehicle for anti-Qing activism among overseas Chinese students and intellectuals.

Li returned to China in 1908 to accept a military posting in Jiangxi Province, but Qing authorities suspected him of harboring anti-government sentiments and placed him under house arrest[^7]. This early persecution only strengthened his revolutionary convictions and commitment to the republican cause. When the Wuchang Uprising erupted on October 10, 1911, sparking the revolution that would topple the Qing Dynasty, Li seized the opportunity to transform from persecuted revolutionary to military leader.

---

## Rise to Power

Upon hearing news of the Wuchang Uprising in October 1911, Li Liejun immediately returned to Jiangxi and was appointed commander of pro-republican forces in Jiujiang[^8]. On October 31, 1911, the Nanchang branch of the Tongmenghui led New Army units in a successful uprising, establishing the Jiangxi Military Government[^9]. Li was elected military governor of Jiangxi Province, giving him control over one of China's strategically important central provinces. He promptly declared Jiangxi's independence from Qing rule and launched military expeditions against remaining Qing forces.

Demonstrating considerable military and organizational talent, Li raised a pro-republic army in neighboring Anhui Province and joined forces with Li Yuanhong, another revolutionary general[^10]. Through these coordinated efforts, Li eventually came to control military forces across five provinces of central China, making him one of the most powerful revolutionary commanders during the final collapse of the Qing Dynasty. This rapid accumulation of military power established Li as a major political force in the emerging Republic.

In 1912, following the abdication of the last Qing emperor and the establishment of the Republic of China, Li was formally appointed Military Governor of Jiangxi Province[^11]. However, his position became increasingly precarious as Yuan Shikai, the former Qing general who had been elected provisional president, began consolidating authoritarian control. Yuan viewed the provincial military governors loyal to Sun Yat-sen's Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) as threats to his centralized power.

On June 9, 1913, President Yuan Shikai dismissed Li Liejun from his post as governor of Jiangxi, along with other Kuomintang governors, in a calculated move to weaken the Kuomintang's control over provincial governments[^12]. Yuan replaced Li with Vice President Li Yuanhong, signaling his intention to subordinate provincial military power to the central government. This dismissal was part of Yuan's broader campaign against the Kuomintang following the assassination of Song Jiaoren, a leading Kuomintang parliamentarian who had been outspoken in his opposition to Yuan's autocratic tendencies.

## Major Achievements

### Leadership in the Second Revolution (1913)

Refusing to accept his dismissal quietly, Li Liejun took the lead in organizing military resistance against Yuan Shikai. On July 12, 1913, Li rose up at Hukou, Jiangxi, proclaiming Jiangxi's independence and organizing the Tuyuan Army, taking office as commander-in-chief of the seven-province Tuyuan Union Army[^13]. This uprising, supported by Sun Yat-sen, initiated what became known as the Second Revolution. Other provinces including Nanjing, Shanghai, Anhui, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Sichuan followed suit in declaring independence from Yuan's government[^14].

Li's decision to resist Yuan Shikai represented a principled stand against the consolidation of authoritarian power in the new republic. The Kuomintang sought to enable the cabinet and National Assembly to restrict Yuan's presidential powers and promote democratic development[^15]. Li and his allies justified their uprising by arguing that Yuan was using his office for selfish benefit, undermining the republican institutions that the revolution had established.

However, the Second Revolution proved to be a military disaster. Yuan's powerful Beiyang Army, commanded by experienced generals and equipped with superior weaponry, crushed the rebellion in just two months[^16]. Li's poorly organized troops were quickly overwhelmed by Beiyang forces, and both Hukou and Nanchang fell in rapid succession[^17]. The rebellion failed miserably, forcing Li to flee into exile, first to Japan, then to Europe, and later to Southeast Asia[^18]. Despite its military failure, Li's resistance established him as a committed opponent of autocracy and defender of republican principles.

### The National Protection War (1915-1916)

Li's most celebrated achievement came during the National Protection War, when he joined forces with generals Cai E and Tang Jiyao to prevent Yuan Shikai from restoring monarchical rule in China. In December 1915, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself the Hongxian Emperor, attempting to establish a new imperial dynasty[^19]. This brazen move to abandon even the pretense of republican government provoked widespread opposition.

On December 25, 1915, Cai E, Tang Jiyao, and Li Liejun, following the advice of reformist intellectual Liang Qichao, declared Yunnan Province independent and expressed their opposition to Yuan's monarchy[^20]. On January 1, 1916, they issued a "Public Announcement of the National Protection Military Government," with the three generals as its sole signatories[^21]. The coalition formed the National Protection Army, with Tang Jiyao remaining as governor of Yunnan while Cai E and Li Liejun assumed military command.

Yunnan warlord Cai E placed Li in command of one of his three armies and assigned him the task of capturing Guangxi Province[^22]. However, Li encountered significant military setbacks during this campaign. He was defeated by Long Jiguang, the Guangdong-based warlord, and was forced to flee to Hainan Island[^23]. Despite Li's personal military failures, the broader National Protection War succeeded in its objectives. Yuan's forces suffered heavy losses, particularly from Cai E's campaigns in Sichuan, and province after province rebelled against the would-be emperor. Yuan renounced his imperial ambitions in March 1916 and died in June of the same year, broken and humiliated[^24].

Following their victory, Li Liejun, Cai E, and Tang Jiyao were widely celebrated as saviors of the Republic who had prevented China from returning to monarchical rule[^25]. This achievement represented the pinnacle of Li's reputation as a defender of republican government.

### Role in the Constitutional Protection Movement

After Yuan Shikai's death, Li Liejun became a key figure in Sun Yat-sen's Constitutional Protection Movement (1917-1922), which sought to resist the Beiyang government in Beijing and protect the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China[^26]. In August 1917, approximately 100 original members of parliament convened in Guangzhou and established a military government dedicated to protecting the constitutional order[^27]. On September 1, 1917, 84 members of this rump parliament elected Sun Yat-sen as generalissimo.

When Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated on September 10, 1917, he appointed Li Liejun as Chief of Staff of the Constitutional Protection military government, alongside other key positions including Li Fulin as Commander of the Guards, Xu Chongzhi as staff officer, and Chen Jiongming as Commander of the First Army[^28]. This appointment made Li one of Sun's most trusted military advisors during this critical period when rival governments in Beijing and Guangzhou both claimed to be the legitimate authority of the Republic of China.

After factional conflicts within the Constitutional Protection Movement, Sun Yat-sen temporarily handed over power on January 19, 1923, to a collective leadership including Hu Hanmin, Li Liejun, Wei Bangping, Xu Chongzhi, and Zou Lu, who jointly exercised presidential powers[^29]. This arrangement demonstrated Li's standing as one of the senior leaders of the southern republican movement.

### Later Career in Nationalist Government

Li Liejun remained an important decision-maker in the Kuomintang government after Chiang Kai-shek consolidated power in 1925[^30]. In 1927, he served as a standing member of the National Government and a standing member of the Military Commission. His long revolutionary credentials and loyalty to the republican cause earned him continued respect despite his mixed military record.

In 1931, Li was appointed State Councilor of the Nationalist Government, and in 1932 he was nominated as a member of the National Military Council, serving in this capacity until 1945[^31]. During this period, which encompassed the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), Li held administrative and advisory positions rather than active battlefield commands. His role was primarily that of senior statesman, lending his prestige and experience to the Nationalist government's war effort against Japan.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Military Failures

Despite his reputation as a revolutionary hero, Li Liejun's actual military record was marked by significant failures. The Second Revolution of 1913, which Li initiated and led, failed miserably, with Yuan Shikai's forces overrunning the rebels within just two months[^32]. Li's poorly organized forces were no match for the disciplined and well-equipped Beiyang Army. This decisive defeat forced him into years of exile and demonstrated that his military abilities did not match his political courage.

Similarly, during the National Protection War, Li was defeated by the Guangdong-based warlord Long Jiguang and forced to flee to Hainan[^33]. While his allies Cai E and Tang Jiyao achieved military successes that contributed to the defeat of Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions, Li's own campaign to capture Guangxi Province ended in failure. These military setbacks suggest that Li was more effective as a political figure and symbol of resistance than as an actual battlefield commander.

### Unintended Contribution to Warlordism

Ironically, scholarly analysis has revealed that Li Liejun and his colleagues in the National Protection War inadvertently laid the intellectual foundations for the warlordism that would plague China for decades. According to historian Clemens Büttner, "While Li Liejun had opposed Yuan in 1913, it had not been in defense of democracy; instead, Li had accused Yuan of working toward a restoration of the monarchy"[^34]. The National Protection War, despite its declared goal to defend the republican system, did not lead to the resurgence of democratic institutions after victory.

Rather, the actions of Li, Cai E, and Tang Jiyao were motivated by two interdependent ideas that decisively contributed to the later rise of warlordism: "the assumption that the professional soldier ought to play a prominent role in the Chinese nation-state-building project and the belief that the military man was obligated to defend the Chinese nation against all threats"[^35]. These principles, while initially used to justify resistance to Yuan Shikai's authoritarianism, provided ideological cover for subsequent warlords who claimed to be defending the nation while actually pursuing regional power.

As Büttner notes, "Warlords were actually closely following in the footsteps of Cai E, Tang Jiyao, and Li Liejun"[^36]. The National Protection War established the precedent that military commanders could legitimately challenge central authority in the name of defending the nation or the constitution, a precedent that countless warlords would exploit during China's fragmented warlord era of the 1920s and 1930s.

### Political Expediency Over Democratic Principles

While Li is often celebrated as a defender of republican government, his actual commitment to democratic principles is questionable. His opposition to Yuan Shikai focused primarily on Yuan's attempt to restore monarchy rather than on genuine democratic accountability. After the National Protection War's victory, Li did not work to strengthen parliamentary institutions or civilian control over the military; instead, he became part of various military governments that wielded power through armed force rather than democratic legitimacy.

Li was dismissed from office on June 9, 1913, and was denounced as a traitor by powerful members of the Beiyang Warlords, such as Peng Guozhang[^37]. However, Li himself would later participate in the same system of military-dominated politics that characterized the warlord era, holding positions of power based on military force and personal connections rather than popular mandate or constitutional authority.

### Complicity in Authoritarian Rule

As a member of Chiang Kai-shek's National Military Council from 1932 to 1945, Li Liejun served a regime that was itself authoritarian in nature, though it opposed Japanese imperialism[^38]. The Nationalist government under Chiang suppressed political opposition, limited civil liberties, and maintained power through military force—many of the same practices that Li had ostensibly opposed during Yuan Shikai's rule. This raises questions about whether Li's opposition to Yuan was based on principled commitment to democracy or simply opposition to a rival power center.

---

## Personal Life

Li Liejun had two wives, though their names are not well-documented in available sources. His first wife gave birth to only one son, while his second wife had nine children, giving Li a total of ten children[^39]. This polygamous arrangement was common among prominent Chinese men of his generation, reflecting traditional social practices that persisted despite the revolutionary changes in China's political system.

Li's youngest son, Li Ligu, graduated from Harbin Medical School and pursued a career in medicine and public administration rather than following his father into military service[^40]. Li Ligu was appointed deputy mayor of Handan in 1987, suggesting that at least some of Li Liejun's descendants remained politically active in China decades after his death, albeit serving the Communist government that succeeded the Nationalist regime his father had served.

As a professional military officer educated in Japan, Li embodied the new class of modernized Chinese soldiers who emerged in the late Qing and early Republican periods. Along with his classmates Cai E, Tang Jiyao, and others, Li represented a generation that had undergone "lengthy processes of military education and professional socialization" and "assumed that they, on the grounds of their professional expertise, were uniquely qualified to identify the interests of the Chinese nation"[^41]. This professional military identity shaped Li's worldview and his belief that military men had both the right and the duty to intervene in politics when they believed the nation was threatened.

Li's personality and character are not extensively documented, but his actions reveal a man of considerable personal courage willing to risk exile and death for his principles. His repeated opposition to Yuan Shikai despite overwhelming military disadvantages demonstrates genuine commitment to his conception of republican government, even if that conception prioritized anti-monarchism over democratic participation. Contemporary accounts describe him as a dedicated revolutionary who maintained his principles throughout decades of political turbulence.

## Legacy

Li Liejun died on February 20, 1946, in Chongqing, just three days before his 64th birthday and mere months after Japan's surrender ended World War II[^42]. The Nationalist government held a state funeral to commemorate him as a senior member of the Kuomintang and a veteran of China's revolutionary struggles[^43]. Notably, key leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, including Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu, also paid their condolences, recognizing Li's role in opposing both Qing monarchism and Japanese imperialism despite the deepening civil war between Nationalists and Communists.

Li's legacy is complex and multifaceted. On one hand, he is remembered as one of the pioneers of China's republican revolution, a military leader who risked everything to oppose the restoration of monarchy and defend constitutional government. His participation in the 1911 Revolution, the Second Revolution, and the National Protection War established him as a committed opponent of authoritarianism who stood by his principles even in defeat and exile.

On the other hand, modern historical scholarship has complicated this heroic narrative by examining how Li and his colleagues inadvertently contributed to the warlordism that devastated China in the 1920s and 1930s. Their emphasis on the military's role in defending the nation and their willingness to use force against central authority, even for ostensibly principled reasons, established precedents that less scrupulous warlords would exploit for personal gain.

In contemporary China, Li Liejun is generally remembered as a revolutionary hero and early Republican leader, particularly in his home province of Jiangxi. His opposition to Yuan Shikai's monarchical ambitions and his role in the National Protection War are celebrated as important contributions to China's struggle against feudalism and authoritarianism. However, his later association with the Kuomintang means he receives less attention in mainland China than revolutionary figures who eventually joined or supported the Communist Party.

Li's life reflects the broader tragedy of China's Republican period: revolutionary idealism that overthrew the Qing Dynasty but failed to establish stable democratic institutions, giving way instead to warlordism, civil war, and foreign invasion. His career demonstrates both the courage of China's early republicans and the limitations of military-led attempts to build a constitutional democracy.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and historians sympathetic to Li Liejun emphasize his principled opposition to authoritarianism and his willingness to sacrifice personal safety and political position for republican ideals. His repeated resistance to Yuan Shikai, despite facing overwhelming military superiority, demonstrates genuine commitment to preventing the restoration of monarchical rule. As one of the generals who issued the "Public Announcement of the National Protection Military Government" on January 1, 1916, Li helped prevent China from returning to imperial rule at a critical juncture[^44].

Li is praised for his role in the 1911 Revolution, when he successfully brought Jiangxi Province into the republican fold and demonstrated effective military leadership in controlling forces across five central Chinese provinces[^45]. This achievement contributed significantly to the rapid collapse of Qing rule and the establishment of the Republic of China. His early revolutionary activities, including his membership in the Tongmenghui while studying in Japan, mark him as a genuine revolutionary rather than an opportunist who joined the movement only after its success became apparent.

Admirers note that Li maintained his revolutionary principles throughout his long career, serving the republican cause from his youth in Japan through his death in 1946. Unlike some contemporaries who switched sides multiple times based on personal advantage, Li remained consistently aligned with Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang. His appointment to senior positions in the Nationalist government during the 1930s and 1940s reflected the respect he earned through decades of service.

The fact that both Nationalist and Communist leaders paid respects at his funeral suggests that Li was widely recognized as a patriotic figure who contributed to China's struggle for national independence and modern government, transcending the partisan conflicts that divided China in the 1940s[^46]. This cross-partisan respect indicates that Li was viewed as representing the best aspirations of China's republican revolution, even as the political system he fought to establish ultimately failed.

### Negative Views

Critics and revisionist historians emphasize Li's military failures and his unintended contribution to the militarization of Chinese politics. The Second Revolution's rapid defeat revealed Li's limitations as a military commander and the weakness of his political base[^47]. His inability to organize effective resistance to Yuan Shikai's superior forces suggests that his revolutionary courage outstripped his strategic and tactical abilities.

More fundamentally, scholars like Clemens Büttner argue that Li and his colleagues in the National Protection War established ideological foundations for warlordism by legitimizing military intervention in politics. As Büttner writes, "Despite their declared goal to defend the Republican polity and their victory, the Republic did not resurge, and the actions of these men were motivated by ideas that decisively contributed to the later rise of warlordism"[^48]. This interpretation suggests that Li's legacy is not one of defending democracy but rather of empowering military strongmen to claim they were defending the nation while actually pursuing power.

Critics also note that Li never developed or articulated a coherent vision for democratic governance beyond opposition to monarchy. His participation in various military governments in Guangzhou and later in Chiang Kai-shek's authoritarian Nationalist regime suggests that his commitment was more to military-led republicanism than to genuine democratic participation and civilian control of the military. The Constitutional Protection Movement, in which Li played a leading role, ultimately failed to restore constitutional government and instead contributed to China's political fragmentation.

Some historians question whether Li's opposition to Yuan Shikai was truly motivated by democratic principles or simply by resentment at being removed from power. Yuan's dismissal of Li and other Kuomintang governors in 1913 directly threatened their personal positions and regional power bases, providing strong personal incentives for resistance regardless of broader principles[^49]. The fact that Li later served in similarly undemocratic military governments suggests his opposition to Yuan may have been more about who wielded power than about how power should be exercised.

Finally, critics note that Li's defeat by Long Jiguang during the National Protection War, while his allies achieved victories, indicates that he was perhaps the least capable military commander of the three National Protection leaders[^50]. His historical reputation may rest more on his association with more successful revolutionaries than on his personal achievements.
