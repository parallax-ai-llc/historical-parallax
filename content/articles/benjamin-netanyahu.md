## Summary

Benjamin "Bibi" Netanyahu (born October 21, 1949) has served as Prime Minister of Israel for longer than anyone else (1996-1999, 2009-2021, 2022-present), making him the dominant figure in Israeli politics for a generation. A master political survivor, Netanyahu has championed right-wing policies, expanded settlements, opposed Palestinian statehood, aligned closely with the Republican Party in the U.S., faced multiple corruption indictments, and presided over the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack and subsequent Gaza war.
