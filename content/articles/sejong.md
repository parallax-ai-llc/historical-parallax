## Summary

Sejong the Great (born May 15, 1397; died April 8, 1450) was the 4th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1418 to 1450.[^1] He is universally regarded as the greatest monarch in Korean history. A polymath and benevolent ruler, his reign is the cultural and scientific zenith of the dynasty. His most enduring legacy is the creation of **Hangul** (the Korean alphabet), which democratized literacy. He also sponsored advancements in science (promoting **Jang Yeong-sil**), medicine, music, and law, and expanded Joseon's territory to the Yalu and Tumen rivers.[^2]

## The Creation of Hangul (Hunminjeongeum)

In 1443, Sejong personally created a new script for his people, officially proclaimed in 1446 as **Hunminjeongeum** ("The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People").

- **Purpose:** Before Hangul, Koreans used Chinese characters (Hanja), which were difficult for commoners to learn. Sejong wanted a phonetic script that was easy to learn so that even the lowest classes could read and write.
- **Opposition:** He faced fierce opposition from the scholar elite (Sadaebu), who believed using a "vulgar script" instead of Hanja would separate Joseon from Chinese civilization.
- **Design:** The letters are scientifically designed to mimic the shape of the mouth and tongue when pronouncing the sounds.[^3]

## Science and Technology

Sejong practiced meritocracy, famously hiring the brilliant slave-born inventor **Jang Yeong-sil**. Together, they created:

- **Jagyeokru:** A self-striking water clock.
- **Angbuilgu:** A hemispherical sundial.
- **Chugugi:** The world's first standardized rain gauge (perfected by his son Munjong).
- **Astronomy:** He commissioned calendars calculated for the latitude of Seoul, independent of the Chinese capital.[^4]

## The Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon)

He expanded the **Jiphyeonjeon** (Hall of Worthies) into a royal research institute.

- **Scholars:** It housed the brightest minds of the era (like Shin Suk-ju and Seong Sam-mun), who assisted the King in his vast academic projects, including history, geography, and law.[^5]

## Territory and Military

- **Four Commanderies and Six Garrisons:** To secure the northern border against the Jurchens, he ordered General **Kim Jong-seo** and General Choe Yun-deok to conquer the Yalu and Tumen river regions, establishing the modern border of North Korea.[^6]
- **Tsushima Island:** He ordered the **Gihae Eastern Expedition** to suppress Japanese pirates based on Tsushima Island, securing peace on the southern coast.
