## Overview

Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were American citizens executed for conspiracy to commit espionage in 1953. They were convicted of passing top-secret information about the atomic bomb and other military technology to the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Their case was one of the most controversial in American history, polarizing the nation during the height of the "Red Scare" and McCarthyism. While decades later, declassified Soviet cables (Venona project) confirmed Julius was indeed a spy, Ethel's involvement remains debated, with many believing she was executed primarily as leverage against her husband—a "hostage" who refused to break.

## Background

### The Atomic Age

**1945:** USA detonates first atomic bomb (Trinity).
**1949:** Soviet Union detonates its first bomb ("Joe-1"). Shocked the West (expected heavily 5-10 years later).
**Suspicion:** How did they get it so fast? Spies.

### The Spy Ring

**Klaus Fuchs:**
German-British physicist (Manhattan Project). Arrested 1950. Confessed passing secrets. Implicated his courier...

**Harry Gold:**
Courier. Confessed. Implicated...

**David Greenglass:**
Army machinist at Los Alamos. Brother of Ethel Rosenberg. Arrested June 1950.
To save himself and his wife Ruth, he implicated his brother-in-law Julius and sister Ethel.

## The Trial (1951)

### "The Crime of the Century"

**Prosecution:**
Irving Saypol and **Roy Cohn** (future McCarthy aide and Trump mentor).
Argued Rosenbergs stole the "secret of the atom bomb" and gave it to Stalin, causing the Korean War (hyperbole—the info was rudimentary, but intent was real).

**Defense:**
Emanuel Bloch. Incompetent strategy. Rosenbergs pleaded 5th Amendment repeatedly (looking guilty).

**David Greenglass Testimony:**
Testified that Julius got atomic sketches from him and Ethel typed them up in September 1945.
(Later admitted he lied about Ethel typing to protect his wife Ruth).

### Verdict

**Guilty:** Conspiracy to commit espionage.

**Sentence:**
Judge Irving Kaufman:
> "I consider your crime worse than murder... you have altered the course of history to the disadvantage of our country."

**Death Penalty:**
Unusual for civilians in peacetime (technically espionage act applies in wartime/emergency).

## The Appeals

### Global Protest

**Save the Rosenbergs:**
Pope Pius XII, Albert Einstein, Pablo Picasso pleaded for clemency.
Arguments: Antisemitism? Scapegoating? Mother of two children?

### Eisenhower denials

President Eisenhower refused clemency twice. "I can only say that, by immeasurably increasing the chances of atomic war, the Rosenbergs may have condemned to death tens of millions of innocent people."

## Execution (June 19, 1953)

### Sing Sing Prison

**Sunset:**
Execution rushed to happen before Jewish Sabbath began at sundown (Friday).

**Julius (8:00 PM):**
Died after first jolt.

**Ethel (8:16 PM):**
Botched execution.
Straps too big (she was petite).
First jolt didn't kill her. Heart still beating.
Given two more jolts. Smoke rose from head. Horrific scene.

## The Venona Project (Declassified 1995)

For decades, supporters claimed total innocence.
**1995 Declassifications:**
NSA signals intelligence (Venona) from 1940s.
- **Julius ("LIBERAL"):** Active spy ringleader. Recruited many.
- **Ethel:** Knew about it ("aware of husband's work"), but didn't have code name. Not a principal spy.

**Conclusion:**
Julius was guilty. Ethel was likely accessory but trial evidence (typing) was fabricated by brother. Execution of Ethel universally seen now as excessive/judicial murder.

## Legacy

### McCarthyism

Peak of anti-communist hysteria.

### The Sons

Michael and Robert (adopted by Meeropol family). Spent lives fighting to clear parents' names, then accepting Julius's guilt but fighting for Ethel.

### Roy Cohn

Launched career. Always boasted about frying the Rosenbergs.
