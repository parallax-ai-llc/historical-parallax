## Summary

Ogyu Sorai was a Japanese Confucian philosopher who founded the Ancient Studies (Kogaku) school, advocating a return to the original texts of Confucius rather than later Neo-Confucian interpretations. He argued that morality was socially constructed through rites and institutions, not based on innate nature. He served as an advisor to Shogun Yoshimune on political and economic reforms. His innovative approach to classical texts influenced later Japanese scholarship.
