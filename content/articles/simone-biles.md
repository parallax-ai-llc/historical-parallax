## Early Life and Background

Simone Arianne Biles was born on March 14, 1997, in Columbus, Ohio, to Shanon Biles. Her early childhood was marked by instability, as her biological mother struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, rendering her unable to care for Simone and her three siblings. The children spent time in foster care before being taken in by their maternal grandfather, Ron Biles, and his second wife, Nellie, who lived in Spring, Texas, a suburb north of Houston. Ron and Nellie officially adopted Simone and her younger sister Adria in 2003, providing the stability and support that would prove crucial to Simone's development.

Growing up in the Houston area, Biles discovered gymnastics at age six during a daycare field trip to Bannon's Gymnastix. Her natural talent was immediately apparent, and she began training seriously under coach Aimee Boorman. Despite facing the challenges of her early childhood trauma and being diagnosed with ADHD, for which she takes medication, Biles found an outlet and passion in gymnastics. Her adoptive parents provided unwavering support, with her grandfather even building a state-of-the-art training facility, the World Champions Centre, which opened in 2014 to accommodate her training needs.

Biles was homeschooled during high school to focus on her gymnastics training, graduating in 2015. Her upbringing in a loving adoptive family, combined with her incredible work ethic and natural athletic ability, laid the foundation for what would become one of the most remarkable careers in sports history. The stability provided by Ron and Nellie Biles allowed Simone to channel her energy and talent into gymnastics, transforming a difficult beginning into an extraordinary opportunity.

## Rise to Prominence

Simone Biles' ascent to gymnastics stardom began in her early teens. She competed in her first major international competition at the 2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, at age 16. Despite being relatively unknown on the world stage, Biles won two gold medals (in the all-around and floor exercise) and one bronze medal (on vault), immediately announcing herself as a force in the sport. Her performance was characterized by difficulty levels rarely seen in women's gymnastics and an execution quality that belied her youth and inexperience.

The 2013 World Championships marked the beginning of an unprecedented streak of dominance. In 2014, Biles defended her all-around world title and won four gold medals total (team, all-around, balance beam, and floor exercise), establishing herself as the best gymnast in the world. She continued this dominance in 2015, winning her third consecutive all-around world title and bringing her total World Championship medal count to ten. No American woman had ever achieved such sustained excellence at the World Championships.

By the time the 2016 Rio Olympics approached, Biles was the heavy favorite and the face of American gymnastics. The pressure and expectations were enormous, but she handled them with remarkable poise. At Rio, she won four gold medals (team, all-around, vault, and floor exercise) and one bronze (balance beam), becoming one of the most decorated gymnasts at a single Olympic Games. Her performances were so dominant that she won the all-around by over two points, an almost unheard-of margin at the Olympic level. The Rio Olympics transformed Biles from a gymnastics superstar into a global household name and cultural icon.

Following Rio, Biles took a brief hiatus from competition but returned to dominate the 2018 and 2019 World Championships, adding to her already record-breaking medal collection. By 2019, she had become the most decorated gymnast in World Championship history with 25 medals. Her rise was not just about winning, but about pushing the boundaries of what was possible in the sport, performing skills so difficult that several elements were named after her.

## Major Achievements

Simone Biles' competitive achievements are unparalleled in gymnastics history. She has won a total of 37 Olympic and World Championship medals, including 30 gold medals, making her the most decorated gymnast in the history of the sport. At the World Championships alone, she has earned 25 medals across six championships (2013-2015, 2018-2019, 2023), breaking the previous record of 23 held by Vitaly Scherbo. Her five all-around world titles (2013-2015, 2018-2019) are the most by any gymnast, male or female, in a single discipline.

At the Olympic level, Biles has competed in two Olympics with remarkable success. At the 2016 Rio Olympics, she won four gold medals (team, all-around, vault, floor exercise) and one bronze (balance beam). At the delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics (held in 2021), despite withdrawing from several events due to mental health concerns and experiencing "the twisties," she returned to win a bronze medal on balance beam and a silver medal in the team competition. Her seven Olympic medals tie her with Shannon Miller for the most by an American gymnast.

Beyond her medal count, Biles has revolutionized gymnastics with her difficulty and innovation. She has five skills named after her across different apparatus: two on floor exercise (a double layout with a half twist and a triple-double), two on vault (the Biles and the Biles II, a Yurchenko double pike), and one on balance beam (a double-double dismount). The Yurchenko double pike, which she performed at the 2023 World Championships, was previously thought to be too dangerous for women to attempt and had only been performed by men in competition.

Her achievements extend beyond competitive gymnastics. Biles has won numerous awards, including the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year (2017, 2019, 2020), Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year (2016, 2019), and was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People multiple times. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2022, becoming the youngest person ever to receive the honor. In 2023, she made a triumphant return to competition at the World Championships in Antwerp, winning four gold medals and one silver, proving her continued dominance at age 26.

Biles has also been a transformative figure in advocating for athlete rights and safety. She was one of the survivors who testified before Congress about the FBI's mishandling of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse investigation, using her platform to demand accountability and systemic change. Her courage in speaking out has helped reshape conversations about athlete welfare and institutional responsibility in sports.

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Simone Biles is widely celebrated, her career has not been without controversy and criticism. The most significant controversy occurred at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in 2021, when Biles withdrew from the team final after one vault and subsequently from the individual all-around, vault, uneven bars, and floor exercise finals, citing mental health concerns and experiencing "the twisties"—a dangerous phenomenon where gymnasts lose their sense of spatial awareness mid-air. Her decision sparked intense debate, with some praising her for prioritizing mental health and safety, while others criticized her for abandoning her team.

Critics, including some former athletes and commentators, accused Biles of quitting under pressure and failing to fulfill her responsibilities to her teammates and country. Conservative commentators, in particular, characterized her withdrawal as emblematic of a generation that prioritizes personal well-being over toughness and commitment. The criticism intensified when it was revealed that she had been dealing with family issues, including her aunt's unexpected death during the Olympics. Detractors argued that elite athletes should be able to compartmentalize personal issues and perform under any circumstances.

Another area of criticism has focused on Biles' use of medication for ADHD. Following the 2016 Rio Olympics, hackers leaked medical records showing that Biles had a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) to take methylphenidate (commonly known as Ritalin) for her ADHD. While the TUE was legitimate and approved by WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), some questioned whether the medication provided an unfair advantage. Biles responded publicly, confirming her ADHD diagnosis and defending her right to take necessary medication, but the incident highlighted ongoing tensions around medical exemptions in elite sports.

Some within the gymnastics community have also critiqued the scoring system's treatment of Biles' high-difficulty skills. When Biles performs skills that are significantly more difficult than her competitors, the Code of Points sometimes undervalues these elements to discourage other gymnasts from attempting them and potentially getting injured. Critics argue that this penalizes excellence and innovation, though others contend it's necessary for athlete safety. Biles herself has spoken out about this issue, suggesting that the sport's governing bodies may be holding her back to prevent others from being hurt trying to match her difficulty.

Additionally, Biles has faced criticism for her outspokenness and confidence, which some perceive as arrogance. Her social media presence, where she confidently refers to herself as the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) and doesn't shy away from celebrating her achievements, has rubbed some traditional sports fans the wrong way. There's an ongoing tension between her generation's embrace of self-advocacy and self-celebration versus older expectations of athlete humility and deference to institutions.

## Personal Life

Simone Biles' personal life has been shaped by her adoption, her relationships, and her role as an advocate. As mentioned, she was adopted by her maternal grandfather Ron Biles and his wife Nellie, whom she refers to as her parents. She considers Ron and Nellie her true parents and has a complicated relationship with her biological mother, whom she has said she doesn't have contact with. Her sister Adria was also adopted by the Biles family, while her two older siblings were adopted by Ron's sister. The adoption provided Biles with the stability and support necessary for her to thrive.

In terms of romantic relationships, Biles began dating NFL player Jonathan Owens, a safety for the Houston Texans (now with the Chicago Bears), in 2020. The couple got engaged in February 2022 and married in a courthouse ceremony in April 2023, followed by a larger destination wedding in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in May 2023. Their relationship has been public and well-documented on social media, with both athletes supporting each other's careers. However, the relationship briefly courted controversy when Owens stated in an interview that he was "the catch" in the relationship and had never heard of Biles when they first met, comments that many fans found disrespectful given Biles' status as one of the greatest athletes in the world.

Biles is known for her love of her dogs, which she frequently features on social media. She has spoken openly about her mental health journey, including her experiences with therapy and the importance of seeking help. Her willingness to discuss mental health publicly, particularly around the Tokyo Olympics, has helped destigmatize these conversations in the sports world. She has also been candid about being a survivor of sexual abuse by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, using her platform to advocate for survivors and demand institutional accountability.

Outside of gymnastics, Biles has pursued various business ventures and endorsements. She has partnerships with major brands including Athleta (after leaving Nike), Visa, United Airlines, and Kellogg's, among others. She has also ventured into design, creating a line of leotards for GK Elite. In 2021, she participated in the "Gold Over America Tour," a post-Olympic gymnastics tour that she helped create and headline, designed to celebrate gymnasts and inspire the next generation.

Biles' personality is characterized by confidence, resilience, and authenticity. She is known for her infectious smile and her ability to perform under immense pressure, though Tokyo showed that even the greatest athletes have limits. She has been described by those who know her as hardworking, determined, and kind, with a strong sense of self that has allowed her to navigate the intense scrutiny that comes with being one of the world's most famous athletes.

## Legacy

Simone Biles' legacy extends far beyond her unprecedented medal count and record-breaking achievements. She has fundamentally transformed gymnastics, pushing the boundaries of what is physically possible in the sport and inspiring a new generation of gymnasts to aim higher than ever before. Her signature skills, particularly the Yurchenko double pike on vault, have redefined difficulty standards and forced the sport's governing bodies to reconsider how they evaluate and score elite-level gymnastics. Future gymnasts will be chasing the standards she set for decades to come.

Perhaps equally important is Biles' legacy in changing the conversation around athlete mental health and well-being. Her decision to withdraw from events at the Tokyo Olympics to prioritize her mental health sparked a global discussion about the pressures faced by elite athletes and the importance of treating mental health with the same seriousness as physical health. While initially controversial, her choice has been increasingly recognized as courageous and necessary, helping to create space for other athletes to prioritize their well-being. Athletes across various sports have cited Biles as an inspiration for their own decisions to speak openly about mental health challenges.

Biles has also left an indelible mark as an advocate for survivors of sexual abuse. As one of the most high-profile survivors of Larry Nassar's abuse, she has used her platform to demand accountability from USA Gymnastics, the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee, and the FBI. Her testimony before Congress was powerful and unflinching, calling out the institutions that failed to protect young athletes. Her advocacy has contributed to significant reforms in how athletic organizations handle abuse allegations and protect athletes, though she has noted that much more work remains to be done.

As a Black woman in a sport that has historically been dominated by white athletes, Biles has also been an important figure in expanding representation in gymnastics. She has spoken about the unique challenges faced by Black gymnasts, including bias in judging and different standards for hair, attire, and presentation. Her success has helped pave the way for greater diversity in gymnastics and has challenged the sport to confront its racial biases. Young Black gymnasts now see someone who looks like them as the undisputed greatest in the sport's history.

Biles' influence extends into popular culture, where she has become a symbol of excellence, resilience, and authenticity. She has appeared on television shows, magazine covers, and has been the subject of documentaries, including the Facebook Watch series "Simone vs Herself." Her confident embrace of the "GOAT" label has resonated with a generation that values self-advocacy and challenges traditional expectations of athlete humility. She has shown that athletes can be both dominant competitors and multifaceted human beings with lives, struggles, and priorities beyond their sport.

The long-term impact of Simone Biles on gymnastics and sports more broadly will be measured not just in medals and records, but in the cultural shifts she has catalyzed. She has redefined what it means to be a champion, demonstrating that true greatness includes knowing your limits, advocating for yourself and others, and using your platform for positive change. Her legacy is one of athletic excellence combined with moral courage and authentic humanity.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Gymnastics experts, sports commentators, and fellow athletes nearly universally regard Simone Biles as the greatest gymnast of all time. Her combination of difficulty, execution, consistency, and competitive longevity is unprecedented in the sport's history. Legendary gymnastics coach Béla Károlyi, who coached Nadia Comăneci and Mary Lou Retton, called Biles "the greatest gymnast I've seen in my lifetime." Fellow Olympic champion Aly Raisman has stated that Biles "changed the sport forever" and that her impact will be felt for generations.

Sports historians and journalists have praised Biles for transcending her sport and becoming a cultural icon. Christine Brennan of USA Today wrote that Biles "may be the most important American athlete of her generation" due to her combination of athletic dominance and social impact. Her willingness to speak out about mental health, sexual abuse, and athlete welfare has been characterized as heroic by advocates who argue that she has used her platform to create meaningful change.

Mental health advocates have particularly championed Biles for her actions at the Tokyo Olympics. Dr. Michael Phelps, himself an Olympic champion who has spoken openly about mental health struggles, praised Biles for "showing that it's OK to not be OK" and for helping to destigmatize mental health issues in sports. Mental health organizations have noted a significant increase in people seeking help and talking about mental health in the aftermath of Biles' withdrawal, crediting her with helping to normalize these conversations.

Survivors of sexual abuse and their advocates have consistently praised Biles for her courage in speaking out against Larry Nassar and the institutions that protected him. Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar, has called Biles "incredibly brave" and noted that her testimony was crucial in maintaining pressure on USA Gymnastics and the FBI to implement reforms. Advocates for child safety in sports have pointed to Biles as an example of how athletes can drive systemic change.

Academic scholars studying sports, gender, and race have highlighted Biles as a transformative figure who challenges traditional power structures in athletics. Dr. Jamal Harrison Bryant and other cultural commentators have noted the significance of a Black woman dominating a traditionally white sport and using that platform to advocate for change. Feminist scholars have praised Biles for challenging patriarchal expectations of female athletes and demonstrating that women can be both powerful and vulnerable.

### Negative Views

Critics of Simone Biles, while fewer in number and often less prominent than her supporters, have raised several concerns about her actions and their implications. The most significant criticism came following her withdrawal from events at the Tokyo Olympics. Conservative commentators like Charlie Kirk and Piers Morgan characterized her decision as "quitting" and suggested it represented a cultural shift toward prioritizing feelings over duty and perseverance. They argued that previous generations of athletes competed through adversity and that Biles' withdrawal set a poor example for young athletes about resilience and commitment.

Some former athletes and coaches, particularly from older generations, have expressed concerns that Biles' Tokyo withdrawal could encourage other athletes to give up when faced with pressure. They worry about a slippery slope where mental health becomes an excuse for avoiding difficult situations rather than a legitimate concern requiring accommodation. These critics contend that elite sports inherently involve extreme pressure and that athletes who reach the Olympic level should be prepared to handle it, or should not compete at that level.

Within gymnastics circles, there has been some quiet criticism of Biles' dominance and its impact on the sport. Some coaches and former gymnasts have suggested that the scoring system's struggle to accommodate her difficulty levels has created inequities and confusion in judging. Others have argued that her elevation of difficulty standards has made the sport more dangerous, with younger gymnasts attempting skills beyond their capabilities in an effort to keep up. While these critics acknowledge Biles' extraordinary talent, they question whether the sport has evolved in a healthy direction under her influence.

Media critics have occasionally taken issue with Biles' confident public persona and her embrace of the "GOAT" label. While supporters see this as healthy self-advocacy, critics argue it crosses the line into arrogance and self-promotion. Some traditionalists prefer athletes who let their performances speak for themselves and demonstrate greater humility in public statements. This criticism often intersects with broader cultural debates about generational differences in self-presentation and the role of social media in sports.

A small number of commentators have questioned the extent of Biles' endorsements and commercial activities, suggesting that she has prioritized financial opportunities over athletic focus. These critics point to her busy schedule of appearances, partnerships, and business ventures as potentially distracting from training and competition. However, this criticism has been relatively muted, as Biles' competitive results have generally remained exceptional even as she has pursued commercial opportunities.

Some criticism has also focused on the Biles-Owens relationship, particularly following Jonathan Owens' controversial comments about being "the catch." While this criticism is primarily directed at Owens, some have questioned Biles' judgment in staying with someone who would publicly diminish her accomplishments. This criticism, however, has been largely framed as concern for Biles rather than criticism of her character or choices.
