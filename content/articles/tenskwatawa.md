## Summary

Tenskwatawa (the Shawnee Prophet) was the brother of Tecumseh who led a major Native American religious revival in the early 19th century. He experienced visions in 1805 that called for a return to traditional ways and the rejection of European-American culture. He founded Prophetstown on the Tippecanoe River. His followers were defeated at the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811, undermining the movement, but his religious teachings influenced subsequent Native American spiritual movements.
