## Summary

Protagoras of Abdera (c. 490–420 BCE) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher and the first and most famous of the professional Sophists.[^1] He is best known for his philosophical relativism, encapsulated in his famous declaration that "man is the measure of all things," and his agnostic stance toward the gods.[^2] Plato credits him with inventing the role of the professional sophist, and he became one of the most influential intellectuals of fifth-century Athens, where he associated with Pericles and other prominent Athenians.[^3] His revolutionary ideas about knowledge, truth, and virtue profoundly shaped Western philosophy, though they also sparked fierce controversy and condemnation.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Protagoras was born around 490 BCE in Abdera, Thrace, a Greek city on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea, opposite the island of Thasos.[^5] Details about his family background remain uncertain, with conflicting accounts in ancient sources. Some sources suggest his father was named Maeandrius (or possibly Artemon) and was one of the most affluent citizens of Abdera, which would have enabled him to provide his son with a quality education.[^6] However, other historians believe Protagoras came from an ordinary Thracian family, as there are no detailed records about his ancestors.[^7]

The exact nature of Protagoras' early education is lost to antiquity, though several legendary accounts survive. According to Aulus Gellius, Protagoras originally made his living as a porter, but one day the philosopher Democritus—also from Abdera—saw him carrying a load of small pieces of wood tied with a short cord.[^8] Democritus reportedly recognized that Protagoras had arranged the load with such perfect geometric accuracy that he must be a mathematical prodigy, and consequently took him into his household to teach him philosophy.[^9] However, modern scholars consider this story dubious for several reasons: Democritus was actually younger than Protagoras by about thirty years and later became a critic of Protagoras' philosophical positions, particularly his "man-measure" doctrine.[^10]

Another questionable account suggests that Xerxes granted Protagoras' family the rare privilege of having their son educated by the Magi, the Persian priestly class.[^11] Like the Democritus story, this account has been largely discounted by later generations of historians. The numerous contradictory stories from ancient times prove that nothing certain can be said about Protagoras' early life and education.[^12] What is clear, however, is that Abdera provided an intellectually fertile environment, as it was also the birthplace of Democritus and other significant thinkers, suggesting that the young Protagoras had access to philosophical discourse and intellectual stimulation.[^13]

## Rise to Prominence

Protagoras emerged as a leading intellectual figure during the golden age of Athens in the mid-fifth century BCE, when he relocated to the city and began his career as a professional teacher.[^14] He lived in Athens for several years, where he associated with Pericles and other rich and influential Athenians, forming relationships that would prove crucial to his career and reputation.[^15] The relationship between Protagoras and Pericles went beyond mere acquaintance—they became friends, and Protagoras served as an advisor to the powerful Athenian statesman.[^16]

Protagoras acquired great wealth and reputation from his teaching, becoming the first person to charge fees for philosophical instruction and thereby inventing the profession of the Sophist.[^17] He taught as a Sophist for more than 40 years, claiming to teach men "virtue" (aretē) in the conduct of their daily lives.[^18] His teaching focused on practical skills for civic life. According to Plato's dialogue Protagoras, he claimed to teach "the proper management of one's own affairs, how best to run one's household, and the management of public affairs, how to make the most effective contribution to the affairs of the city by word and action."[^19]

The rise of democratic states, particularly Athens, created enormous demand for citizens skilled in public speaking and argumentation, and the sophistic education both grew out of and exploited this shift.[^20] In democratic Athens of the latter fifth century BCE, aretē was increasingly understood in terms of the ability to influence one's fellow citizens in political gatherings through rhetorical persuasion.[^21] Protagoras capitalized on this need brilliantly, offering wealthy young Greek men an education that promised to make them effective speakers and successful politicians.[^22]

The fees Protagoras charged became legendary. While a standard rate for sophist courses seems to have been about 30 minae (where a mina equaled 100 drachmas, and a drachma was a standard daily wage), ancient sources claimed Protagoras charged as much as one hundred minae, though some scholars contest these figures as fantastic sums "fished up" by later writers.[^23] According to Aulus Gellius, Protagoras sometimes took on promising pupils with flexible payment arrangements—he accepted the student Euathlus with the understanding that the student would pay after winning his first court case.[^24]

The pinnacle of Protagoras' public recognition came in 444 BCE when Pericles entrusted him with drafting the constitution for Thurii, a new pan-Hellenic colony in South Italy.[^25] This appointment demonstrated the extraordinary trust Pericles placed in the philosopher's abilities and marked Protagoras as more than just a teacher—he was now recognized as a political theorist capable of designing governmental frameworks.[^26] The colony of Thurii, founded along with exiles from Sybaris in 443 BCE on the Gulf of Taranto, was said to have enjoyed a well-ordered system of laws under the democratic form of government that Protagoras helped establish.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Protagoras' most significant achievements lie in his philosophical innovations and his establishment of sophistic education as a legitimate and influential enterprise in ancient Greece.[^28]

**The "Man-Measure" Doctrine**: Protagoras' most famous philosophical contribution is his relativistic epistemology, expressed in his declaration: "Of all things the measure is Man, of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not."[^29] This statement, which appears to have opened his work Truth (also known as Refutations or The Throws), has been interpreted as the first systematic stance in favor of relativism.[^30] Protagoras seems to have meant that each person's own personal history, experiences, and expectations, developed over their lifetime, determine their judgments, opinions, and statements regarding "truth."[^31] This philosophy implies there are no absolute truths—truth is relative and differs according to each individual's perception.[^32]

**Agnosticism About the Gods**: In his lost work On the Gods, Protagoras opened with a revolutionary statement that challenged traditional Greek piety: "Concerning the gods, I have no means of knowing whether they exist or not, nor of what sort they may be, because of the obscurity of the subject, and the brevity of human life."[^33] This represents the first clearly agnostic philosophical position in Western thought, introducing epistemological skepticism about religious matters rather than outright atheism.[^34] The statement was not an ontological thesis about the gods' existence, but rather an epistemological claim about the limits of human knowledge.[^35]

**Rhetorical and Argumentative Innovations**: Protagoras pioneered the technique of dissoi logoi (contrasting arguments), stating that every argument had two contradicting sides, both of which could be argued.[^36] This pedagogical approach, which forced students to consider issues from multiple perspectives, became fundamental to rhetorical education and influenced modern debate practices.[^37] He also claimed he could "make the worse (or weaker) argument appear the better (or stronger)," a controversial teaching that his critics saw as moral relativism but which Protagoras defended as the ability to identify which of two opposite arguments was better suited to particular circumstances.[^38]

**Linguistic and Grammatical Contributions**: Protagoras made pioneering contributions to Greek linguistics and grammar. He distinguished three genders, three numbers, and probably four pathē (transformations), and identified four sentence-types: wish or prayer, question, answer, and command.[^39] This taxonomic approach became a hallmark of Greek linguistics and represented some of the first systematic grammatical analysis in Western thought.[^40] He devised an early taxonomy of speech acts and was interested in orthoepeia (the correct use of words), writing a work entitled Orthoepeia (The Correctness of Language).[^41] His linguistic work served both rhetorical training for courtroom advocacy and broader philosophical inquiry into the nature of language.[^42]

**Educational Philosophy**: Protagoras addressed one of the central philosophical questions of his era: whether virtue could be taught. Unlike Socrates, who expressed skepticism, Protagoras argued that virtue was indeed teachable, comparing it to language acquisition—just as all children learn to speak through example, precept, and correction from everyone around them, so too could they learn civic virtue and justice.[^43] His position had profound implications for democratic theory, suggesting that all citizens could be educated to participate meaningfully in governance.[^44]

**Written Works**: Although none of his works survive intact, ancient sources attribute several important texts to Protagoras, including Truth (Aletheia), On the Gods, Antilogiai (Opposing Arguments or The Knockdown Arguments), and The Art of Eristics.[^45] Truth was not a scientific treatise but an epideixis—the text of a public performance meant to demonstrate virtuoso skill in argumentation.[^46] The Antilogiai were probably investigations of argumentative techniques, which formed the core of Protagoras' teaching method.[^47]

**Influence on Democratic Theory**: Protagoras' conventionalist notion of justice marked a break with the traditional account of divine justice and seemed to provide a theoretical foundation for democracy based on direct participation.[^48] His ideas about the teachability of civic virtue and the relative nature of political truth supported the democratic ideal that ordinary citizens, not just aristocratic elites, could govern effectively.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Protagoras' revolutionary ideas sparked fierce controversies that persisted throughout his life and beyond, making him one of the most contested figures in ancient philosophy.[^50]

**The Atheism Charge and Alleged Trial**: According to Diogenes Laertius and other ancient sources, Protagoras' agnostic statement about the gods aroused such anger that the Athenians expelled him from the city, and all copies of his book were collected and burned in the marketplace.[^51] Some accounts claim he was convicted in Athens on a charge of impiety (asebeia) and sentenced to death, after which he fled and died in a shipwreck while sailing to Sicily.[^52] However, the classicist John Burnet and other modern scholars doubt these accounts, as both Diogenes Laertius and Cicero wrote hundreds of years after the events and no such persecution is mentioned by Protagoras' contemporaries.[^53] Furthermore, Plato's dialogues speak of Protagoras as having died as a universally esteemed figure in old age, contradicting the trial narrative.[^54] Modern research suggests the trial's existence is dubious and the stories were probably later legends constructed to portray Protagoras' views as receiving divine retribution.[^55]

**The "Making the Weaker Argument Stronger" Controversy**: Protagoras' claim that he could make the weaker argument appear stronger became one of the most controversial aspects of his teaching.[^56] Critics, particularly in Aristophanes' comedy The Clouds, portrayed sophistic rhetoric as teaching clever tricks to cheat creditors and abandon conventional morality, resulting in moral chaos.[^57] Aristotle criticized Protagoras for this claim, and Plato's deep distrust stemmed from fear that young men would learn verbal skills and use sophistic "jugglery of words" in assembly and court, bringing to serious civic business a zeal for victory in disregard of truth.[^58] Protagoras defended this technique as the ability to identify which of two opposite arguments was better suited to particular circumstances, but his critics saw it as dangerous moral relativism.[^59]

**Aristotle's Philosophical Critiques**: Aristotle mounted several systematic criticisms of Protagoras' philosophy in his Metaphysics. He argued that Protagoras' relativism entailed denial of the principle of non-contradiction—if all judgments are true and contradiction is impossible, then even the negation of Protagoras' claim would be compatible with it, making the position self-refuting.[^60] Aristotle also argued that the "man-measure" doctrine was equivalent to the claim that all contradictions are true, since if all appearances are true, whenever people disagree we get a true contradiction.[^61] Additionally, Aristotle criticized Protagoras' theory of perception and thinking, arguing that Protagoras mistakenly believed thinking, like perceiving, was produced through direct, passive affection of the body by external objects.[^62] In matters of mathematics, Aristotle reported that Protagoras attacked geometry by arguing that abstract investigations were hardly compatible with empirical observation, noting that "a hoop does not touch a straight edge at a point."[^63]

**Plato's Literary Critiques**: In his dialogue Protagoras, Plato subjects the sophist to methodological criticism and philosophical challenges. Socrates traps Protagoras in contradictions through dialectic questioning, and the dialogue ends with an ironic reversal where both participants seem to have exchanged positions on whether virtue can be taught.[^64] Traditional readings often result in harsh assessments of Protagoras, with scholars portraying him as "easily distressed," a "weak debater," "impotent," "laughable," "devious," and an "enchanting coward."[^65] However, some modern scholars question whether these negative portrayals reflect Plato's actual view or are dramatic devices.[^66]

**The Professional Teaching Controversy**: The very fact that Protagoras charged fees for instruction generated controversy in Athens. Sophists were depicted unfavorably in Plato's philosophical dialogues as predatory frauds who preyed on ignorant upper-class young men and extracted large sums from their parents.[^67] Athenians thought the sophists charged outrageous fees, and the practice of selling wisdom for money was seen by some as corrupting philosophy's noble purpose.[^68] This criticism reflected broader anxieties about the commercialization of education and the sophists' challenge to traditional aristocratic education.[^69]

**Association with Pericles' Downfall**: The crisis of Periclean politics seems to have found a counterpart in troubles for Protagoras, who—like other personalities close to the statesman—may have faced political persecution due to his association with Pericles.[^70] This political dimension added to the controversies surrounding him, though the exact nature of any persecution remains historically unclear.[^71]

**Lasting Condemnation**: The anecdotes about Protagoras' trial may be fictitious, but it is true that the sophist became the object of "unanimous and enduring condemnation, to the point of bringing together traditionally antithetical schools of thought, such as the Christians and the Epicureans," both of whom condemned his thesis as atheist.[^72] This widespread condemnation lasted for centuries and influenced how later generations understood and evaluated his philosophy.[^73]

## Personal Life

Information about Protagoras' personal life is extremely limited, as ancient sources focused primarily on his philosophical positions and public career rather than his private affairs.[^74]

**Family and Origins**: As noted earlier, Protagoras' father was likely named Maeandrius or Artemon, though sources disagree about whether the family was wealthy or of ordinary means.[^75] No reliable information survives about his mother, siblings, wife, or children. The absence of details about his family in ancient sources suggests either that he came from a relatively unremarkable background or that personal biographical details were not considered important by those who transmitted his legacy.[^76]

**Career Longevity**: Protagoras practiced as a professional sophist for more than 40 years, an extraordinarily long career that testifies to his success, adaptability, and continued relevance.[^77] He is said to have lived approximately 70 years, with his death presumed to have occurred around 420 BCE.[^78] This longevity was remarkable for ancient times and allowed him to influence multiple generations of students and to witness significant changes in Athenian political and intellectual life.[^79]

**Relationship with Pericles**: One of the most significant personal relationships documented about Protagoras was his friendship with Pericles, the leading statesman of Athens during its golden age.[^80] These two men—the statesman ruling Athens in her glory and the philosopher—not only knew each other but appear to have been genuine friends, not merely professional associates.[^81] Pericles trusted Protagoras sufficiently to appoint him as lawgiver for Thurii, demonstrating deep confidence in his judgment and abilities.[^82]

**Character and Reputation**: According to Plato's dialogue, Protagoras acknowledged Socrates as a notable opponent in dispute despite being much younger, and predicted he could become one of the wisest men alive—suggesting Protagoras possessed the ability to recognize talent and intellectual merit in others.[^83] In the same dialogue, Protagoras is portrayed as somewhat concerned with his reputation and status, though whether this reflects the historical person or Plato's literary characterization remains debatable.[^84]

**Itinerant Lifestyle**: Like other sophists, Protagoras was an itinerant professional teacher who traveled throughout the Greek world rather than remaining in one city.[^85] This traveling lifestyle would have exposed him to diverse cultures, customs, and belief systems, likely influencing his relativistic philosophy that recognized the validity of different perspectives.[^86] The fact that he frequented Athens and other major Greek cities suggests he maintained a network of wealthy patrons and students across the Hellenic world.[^87]

**Later Years and Death**: The details of Protagoras' final years remain uncertain due to conflicting ancient accounts. While legendary sources claim he died in a shipwreck while fleeing Athens after a trial for impiety, modern scholars generally regard this as a fabrication designed to suggest divine punishment for his agnosticism.[^88] The more credible account, supported by Plato's portrayal, is that he died peacefully in old age, having maintained his reputation and esteem throughout his life.[^89]

## Legacy

Protagoras' influence on Western philosophy, education, and intellectual history has been profound and enduring, despite the loss of all his writings.[^90]

**Foundational Influence on Philosophy**: Protagoras played a crucial role in redirecting Greek philosophy from the Presocratic focus on natural philosophy to questions about human existence, knowledge, and society.[^91] Along with other Older Sophists and Socrates, he was part of a paradigm shift that emphasized how human subjectivity determines the way we understand, or even construct, our world—a position that remains an essential part of the modern philosophical tradition.[^92] Historically, it was in response to Protagoras and his fellow sophists that Plato began his search for transcendent forms or knowledge that could anchor moral judgment, thus Protagoras indirectly catalyzed one of philosophy's most important developments.[^93]

**Influence on Relativism and Epistemology**: Protagoras' notion that judgments and knowledge are in some way relative to the person judging or knowing has been extraordinarily influential and is still widely discussed in contemporary philosophy.[^94] His "man is the measure" thesis has been interpreted as laying groundwork for relativism, pragmatism, phenomenology, and existentialism.[^95] Modern thinkers often see him as a precursor to contemporary debates about truth, morality, and knowledge in fields such as epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of science.[^96] His emphasis on human perception as a means of understanding the world foreshadowed later developments in these modern philosophical movements.[^97]

**Educational Legacy**: Protagoras' model of professional philosophical education profoundly shaped Western pedagogy.[^98] Rhetoric, as taught by Protagoras, influenced how debates and public speaking are structured in contemporary times, and his emphasis on understanding opposing viewpoints through dissoi logoi remains a cornerstone of modern education in critical thinking and communication.[^99] His argument that virtue could be taught through systematic education supported democratic ideals and continues to inform debates about civic education.[^100]

**Influence on Democratic Theory**: Protagoras' conventionalist notion of justice and his belief in the teachability of civic virtue provided theoretical foundations for participatory democracy.[^101] His ideas challenged aristocratic assumptions that only the well-born could govern and suggested that ordinary citizens could develop the knowledge and skills necessary for political participation.[^102] This contribution to democratic theory remains relevant in contemporary political philosophy.[^103]

**Intellectual Method and Argumentation**: The technique of examining issues from multiple perspectives—dissoi logoi—became fundamental to dialectical methods in philosophy, legal reasoning, and academic discourse.[^104] Law schools still teach students to argue both sides of a case, and philosophical seminars regularly employ the method of considering opposing viewpoints, both practices descended from Protagorean pedagogy.[^105]

**Agnosticism and Religious Skepticism**: Protagoras' agnostic position on the gods was revolutionary for his time and influenced later traditions of religious skepticism and philosophical inquiry into the limits of human knowledge about theological matters.[^106] His epistemological approach to religious questions—focusing on what can be known rather than what exists—established an important methodological precedent.[^107]

**Ongoing Scholarly Interest**: Despite the loss of his works, Protagoras remains a subject of intensive scholarly research and reinterpretation. Modern philosophers continue to debate the proper interpretation of his "man-measure" doctrine, with discussions about whether it supports infallibilism, truth relativism, or pluralism.[^108] Some contemporary interpreters characterize him as an "ethical pragmatist" and "ethical consequentialist" who holds that better moral beliefs are those with better practical results.[^109] His relevance to postmodern philosophy has also been explored, with connections drawn to thinkers like Foucault, Derrida, and Rorty.[^110]

**Limitations of Legacy**: The fact that none of Protagoras' works survive intact significantly limits our understanding of his thought and has made interpretation dependent on hostile sources like Plato and Aristotle, who had philosophical reasons to misrepresent his positions.[^111] This has created ongoing debates about the "real" Protagoras versus the literary character portrayed in Plato's dialogues.[^112]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

**Pioneer of Humanism**: Modern scholars increasingly recognize Protagoras as a pioneer of humanistic philosophy who shifted focus from cosmic speculation to human concerns.[^113] Rather than attempting to understand the divine or natural world beyond human experience, he grounded philosophy in human perception and practical concerns, anticipating modern humanistic traditions.[^114]

**Sophisticated Epistemologist**: Contemporary philosophers have rehabilitated Protagoras' relativism as more sophisticated than Plato's characterization suggested.[^115] His position can be understood not as crude subjectivism but as an early recognition that knowledge is perspectival and context-dependent—a view that resonates with contemporary epistemology and philosophy of science.[^116] The man-measure doctrine represents an important epistemological insight about the role of human subjectivity in constituting knowledge.[^117]

**Democratic Theorist**: Scholars appreciate Protagoras' contributions to democratic political theory, particularly his argument that civic virtue could be taught to all citizens.[^118] His Great Speech in Plato's Protagoras, whether authentic or a Platonic reconstruction, presents a sophisticated defense of democracy based on the distribution of political judgment among all citizens.[^119] His conventionalist account of justice provided philosophical grounding for human-made laws rather than relying on divine authority.[^120]

**Educational Innovator**: Protagoras receives credit for professionalizing education and developing systematic methods of rhetorical and argumentative training.[^121] His techniques for examining issues from multiple perspectives contributed to critical thinking pedagogy that remains valuable today.[^122] His emphasis on practical education for civic participation addressed real social needs in democratic Athens.[^123]

**Linguistic Theorist**: His contributions to grammar and linguistic theory represent pioneering work in systematic language analysis.[^124] Modern linguists recognize him as one of the first thinkers to analyze language's structure and function systematically, establishing foundations for later grammatical theory.[^125]

**Intellectual Courage**: Some scholars admire Protagoras' intellectual courage in challenging conventional pieties about the gods and absolute truth despite the personal risks involved.[^126] His willingness to acknowledge the limits of human knowledge about divine matters represented philosophical honesty that anticipated modern scientific skepticism.[^127]

### Negative Views

**Moral Relativism**: Critics throughout history have condemned Protagoras for undermining objective moral standards.[^128] Aristotle argued that Protagoras' relativism made it impossible to ground ethics in anything substantial and led to moral chaos.[^129] Christian theologians and others later condemned his thesis as promoting atheism and moral nihilism.[^130] This criticism continues in contemporary philosophy, where some argue that thoroughgoing relativism undermines the possibility of moral criticism and progress.[^131]

**Sophistry and Truth**: Plato's critique—that Protagoras taught rhetorical tricks for winning arguments regardless of truth—has significantly damaged his historical reputation.[^132] The charge that he could "make the weaker argument stronger" has been interpreted as teaching dishonest advocacy and logical manipulation.[^133] This portrayal established "sophistry" as a pejorative term for intellectually dishonest argumentation.[^134]

**Commercialization of Philosophy**: Critics condemned Protagoras for charging fees for wisdom, seeing this as corrupting philosophy's noble pursuit of truth.[^135] This criticism reflects the view that genuine philosophical education should not be commodified and that the sophists' profit motive compromised their integrity.[^136] Socrates' refusal to charge fees was explicitly contrasted with sophistic practice to the latter's detriment.[^137]

**Philosophical Incoherence**: Aristotle and later philosophers argued that Protagoras' relativism was self-refuting.[^138] If all judgments are equally true, then the judgment that "not all judgments are equally true" must also be true, creating a logical contradiction.[^139] This charge of incoherence has been repeated throughout philosophical history as a fundamental objection to relativistic positions.[^140]

**Superficiality**: Some ancient and modern critics charge that Protagoras offered mere rhetorical techniques without deep philosophical insight.[^141] Plato portrayed sophistic education as concerned with persuasion rather than truth, appearance rather than reality.[^142] This criticism suggests Protagoras taught skills for success rather than genuine wisdom or virtue.[^143]

**Political Opportunism**: The association with Pericles and wealthy Athenians has been interpreted as evidence of political opportunism rather than genuine philosophical commitment.[^144] Critics suggest Protagoras told wealthy patrons what they wanted to hear—that virtue could be taught and purchased—rather than pursuing truth wherever it led.[^145]

**Limited Surviving Evidence**: Some modern scholars argue that the hostile nature of our sources (primarily Plato and Aristotle, who had philosophical axes to grind) makes fair assessment impossible.[^146] The lack of Protagoras' own writings means we may be judging a caricature rather than the historical figure, and negative assessments may reflect the biases of our sources rather than his actual positions.[^147]
