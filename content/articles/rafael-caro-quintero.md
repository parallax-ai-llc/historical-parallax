## Summary
Rafael Caro Quintero was a Mexican drug lord and co-founder of the Guadalajara Cartel. He was convicted of the 1985 kidnapping and murder of DEA agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena. After serving 28 years, he was controversially released in 2013. He was recaptured in 2022.

## Early Life
Born October 24, 1952, in La Noria, Sinaloa. He became involved in marijuana cultivation as a teenager. He co-founded the Guadalajara Cartel with Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Caro Quintero operated massive marijuana plantations, including the 2,500-acre Rancho Búfalo complex that was raided by Mexican authorities in 1984. The raid, aided by DEA intelligence, led to his ordering the kidnapping and murder of DEA Agent Kiki Camarena in February 1985. Camarena was tortured for over 30 hours before being killed. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Caro Quintero fled to Costa Rica but was arrested there in April 1985 and returned to Mexico. He was convicted and sentenced to 40 years. In August 2013, he was released on a legal technicality, which was quickly overturned. The US put a $20 million bounty on his head. He was recaptured by Mexican marines on July 15, 2022. [^3]
