## Summary

Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan is a Singapore-born author, journalist, and professor who has made significant contributions to contemporary literature and journalism. She is best known for her international bestselling novel *Sarong Party Girls* (2016), written entirely in Singlish, and her memoir *A Tiger in the Kitchen* (2011). Currently serving as the inaugural George R.R. Martin Chair in Storytelling at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Tan has built a distinguished career spanning journalism at major publications like the Wall Street Journal and literary accomplishments that bridge Singaporean and American cultures.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan was born and raised in Singapore, coming of age in a vibrant, multi-cultural society where English, Malay, Mandarin, Hokkien, and Teochew languages intermingled to create the distinctive patois known as Singlish. Born in the Year of the Tiger according to the Chinese zodiac, Tan grew up immersed in Singaporean food culture and family traditions that would later inspire her memoir writing.[^3][^4]

From an early age, Tan was a voracious reader, particularly drawn to Enid Blyton's works, which sparked her desire to become a writer. However, growing up in Singapore, she realized that if she wanted to pursue journalism and "be as mouthy in her work as she was in real life," she would need to leave Singapore to do so. This realization led her to make a life-changing decision at age 18.[^5][^6]

Her family background was rooted in Chinese-Singaporean heritage, with grandmothers and aunties who were skilled cooks and keepers of family culinary traditions. Her parents' later-in-life divorce would become a family-splintering event that affected her deeply, though it also motivated her to reconnect with her roots through food and storytelling. The women in her family, particularly her late grandmother, would become central figures in her memoir about Singaporean cuisine and family bonds.[^7][^8]

In 1993, at age 18, Tan crossed the ocean to attend Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, embarking on a journey that would define her career and literary voice. This move marked the beginning of her American chapter and her formal training in journalism at one of the nation's most prestigious journalism schools.[^9]

---

## Rise to Prominence

Tan's journalism career began immediately after graduating from Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism with a Bachelor of Science in Journalism in 1997. She started her professional journey helping out on the cops beat at the Baltimore Sun, where she worked as a reporter from 1997 to 2003. This early experience covering crime and local news provided her with foundational reporting skills and an understanding of storytelling that would serve her throughout her career.[^10][^11]

From the Baltimore Sun, Tan moved to one of America's most prestigious publications, the Wall Street Journal, where she worked as a staff writer focusing on fashion, retail, and home design. At the Journal, she wrote an influential essay about journeying to Singapore to discover her late grandmother's stories by learning how to cook her dishes. This essay became the seed for what would eventually become her first book, the memoir *A Tiger in the Kitchen*.[^12][^13]

Following her tenure at the Wall Street Journal, Tan became senior fashion writer at InStyle magazine, further establishing her expertise in lifestyle and cultural journalism. Throughout her journalism career, her work appeared in numerous major publications including The New York Times, The Paris Review, The Washington Post, Bon Appetit, Food & Wine, National Geographic, Foreign Policy, Marie Claire, Newsweek, Bloomberg Businessweek, and the Singapore Straits Times, among many others.[^14][^15]

Tan's commitment to Asian American representation in media led her to become an active member of the Asian American Journalists Association (AAJA), where she served on the national board for seven years, ending in 2010. Her leadership role in AAJA demonstrated her dedication to supporting and mentoring Asian American journalists across the country.[^16]

## Major Achievements

### Literary Success

Tan's debut memoir, *A Tiger in the Kitchen: A Memoir of Food and Family*, was published by Hyperion in 2011 and became an international bestseller. The book chronicles her journey back to Singapore to learn her family's traditional recipes and reconnect with her cultural heritage. The memoir received widespread critical acclaim, with the Wall Street Journal calling it a "Delicious intergenerational food memoir" and the Los Angeles Times praising how "Tan's tiger qualities reveal themselves in her fierce determination to draw her past into her present."[^17][^18]

The book was recommended by NBC's Today Show and NPR's Morning Edition, and featured ten authentic recipes for Singaporean classics such as pineapple tarts and Teochew braised duck. People magazine gave it a three-star review, while Library Journal called it "A warm, witty chronicle of growing up and finding one's place between cultures." The memoir resonated with readers navigating their own experiences between cultures and seeking connections to family heritage.[^19][^20]

Her second book, *Sarong Party Girls*, published by William Morrow in 2016, became a groundbreaking work of contemporary fiction. Written entirely in Singlish—the unique Singaporean creole mixing English, Malay, Mandarin, Hokkien, and other languages—the novel tells the story of Jazzy, a young woman on the cusp of twenty-seven who hatches a plan with her best friends to marry rich Western expat husbands before the year ends. The novel has been described as "Emma set in modern Asia," exploring themes of class, race, gender, and postcolonial identity in contemporary Singapore.[^21][^22]

*Sarong Party Girls* broke records, spending twenty-eight weeks on the bestseller list in Singapore—the longest for a Singaporean author at that time. The novel received praise from literary luminaries including Ruth Ozeki, who called it "Utterly irresistible," and Paul Theroux, who described it as "hilarious and original" and "deeply subversive." Hillary Jordan praised it as "a stinging and deliciously subversive critique of Singapore's patriarchal social system."[^23][^24]

### Editorial Leadership

In 2014, Tan edited *Singapore Noir* for Akashic Books' acclaimed Noir anthology series. The collection featured fourteen tales from a strong lineup of Singapore natives and knowledgeable visitors, including three winners of the Singapore Literature Prize: Simon Tay, Colin Cheong, and Suchen Christine Lim. The anthology explored the dark underbelly of Singapore, presenting a side of the gleaming city-state rarely depicted in literature.[^25][^26]

In 2022, Tan co-created and co-edited *Anonymous Sex* with Hillary Jordan, published by Scribner Books. This bold anthology featured twenty-seven stories about sex from twenty-seven authors—including winners of the Pulitzer Prize, National Book Award, PEN Awards, the Women's Prize for Fiction, Edgar Award, and more—with no names attached to the stories. Contributors included Louise Erdrich, Helen Oyeyemi, Rebecca Makkai, Jason Reynolds, Paul Theroux, Edmund White, and Mary-Louise Parker. The innovative concept explored various themes including sexual obsession, domination, revenge sex, and even sex in the afterlife, becoming an international bestseller.[^27][^28]

### Academic Honors

In 2023, Tan was appointed as the inaugural George R.R. Martin Chair in Storytelling at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, beginning her tenure in September. The official investiture ceremony took place on February 28, 2024, which George R.R. Martin himself attended. Medill Dean Charles Whitaker praised Tan, stating: "Storytelling is at the foundation of our school, and Cheryl's expertise in telling her own stories and helping others tell their stories will allow Medill to build on its tradition of excellence in this area."[^29][^30]

In this prestigious role, Tan leads the George R.R. Martin Summer Intensive Writing Workshop and teaches courses across a breadth of genres to both undergraduate and graduate students. She conducts memoir writing workshops exploring how to draw readers into memoir narratives and teaches students the formula for crafting proposals to pitch memoirs to literary agents and book editors.[^31]

### Recognition and Grants

The National Arts Council of Singapore has awarded Tan multiple grants in support of her writing, totaling over $18,000, including major grants in 2011 and 2012. These grants were awarded in recognition of her work as a native Singaporean artist and her contributions to emerging writing careers and literary development.[^32][^33]

Tan has been an artist in residence at numerous prestigious institutions including Yaddo, Hawthornden Castle, The Studios of Key West, and the Headlands Center for the Arts. She was also appointed as the inaugural Chair of the Artist Residency Alumni Network at The Studios of Key West, further demonstrating her leadership in the literary community.[^34][^35]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Tan's work has received significant acclaim, it has not been without controversy and critical debate, particularly surrounding *Sarong Party Girls*. The novel's unflinching portrayal of Singapore's "sarong party girl" subculture—young Singaporean women who seek wealthy Western expat husbands—sparked considerable discussion about race, class, and gender politics in Singapore.[^36]

Some critics found the protagonist Jazzy difficult to connect with, describing her as "totally vapid, unlikeable, and lacking any real depth" with "little if any growth" throughout the narrative. One reviewer noted, "There's also rather a lot of casual racism in this book," observing that "Every time I got to a stage where I felt kind of sorry for Jazzy she then does, says or thinks something so horrifically judgemental."[^37]

The novel's use of Singlish throughout also proved controversial. While Tan defended her decision as artistically necessary—stating that without Singlish "there would have been no novel" and that "there are things she can say in Singlish that she can't convey in standardized English"—some readers found the language barrier challenging. The novel was notably excluded from the Singapore Writers Festival, raising questions about literary gatekeeping and language politics in Singapore.[^38][^39]

Tan herself anticipated such reactions, stating in interviews that she found the SPG culture and the surrounding discourse "completely fascinating—this little subculture in Singapore, to me, says something significant about the country and the sexual and racial politics of the place." She added that in writing the book, she "wanted to throw back the curtain on some of the things and places that 'nice' people avoid talking about."[^40]

Her father's reaction to the novel encapsulated some of the generational and cultural tensions the book exposed. As the first family member to read *Sarong Party Girls*, he summoned Tan to lunch and asked her crossly, "Who taught you to speak like that?" This response highlighted concerns among some Singaporeans about how the nation and its people were being represented in international literature.[^41]

Some literary scholars have examined how Tan, as a diasporic Singaporean Chinese female writer, uses stereotypes in her work, questioning whether such representations reinforce problematic narratives or serve to critique them. Academic research has studied how writers like Tan navigate cultural representation in the global literary marketplace while negotiating the boundaries of postcolonial literary authorship.[^42]

---

## Personal Life

Tan is married, though she maintains privacy regarding her husband's identity. Her memoir *A Tiger in the Kitchen* reveals that she has a Korean mother-in-law and references leaving her husband for weeks at a time while traveling to Singapore to learn family recipes and reconnect with her heritage. These journeys, while necessary for her writing and personal growth, required sacrifice and understanding from her spouse.[^43][^44]

A mentor in Singapore once told Tan that he worried about her because sometimes he thought she might "think too much like a man." This comment profoundly affected her understanding of gender dynamics in traditional Asian cultures. Tan reflected that it drove home how "in certain traditional cultures—even ones in glitzy, modern cities that may seem completely progressive—no matter what you do and no matter how well you may be doing, to some men, you'll always be a 'woman.'" This experience informed her feminist perspective in her writing, particularly in *Sarong Party Girls*.[^45]

Tan divides her time between New York City, where she is based, and Evanston, Illinois, where she teaches at Northwestern University. She maintains strong connections to Singapore, visiting regularly for research, family connections, and to stay engaged with the literary community there. Her Instagram and social media presence (@cheryltan88) shows her engagement with food culture, writing, and teaching.[^46][^47]

Despite her success in America, Tan has expressed a deep sense of responsibility to tell Singaporean stories well and to shed light on the daily rhythms and folkways of her homeland. This commitment to representing Singapore authentically, even when such representations prove controversial, defines her approach to both journalism and fiction writing.[^48]

---

## Legacy

Cheryl Lu-Lien Tan's legacy lies in her pioneering role as a bridge between Singaporean and American literary cultures, and in her bold championing of Singlish as a legitimate literary language. By writing *Sarong Party Girls* entirely in Singlish, she created what is likely the world's first novel written entirely in Singapore's distinctive patois, validating a language form that had been marginalized in formal literature.[^49][^50]

Tan's work has contributed significantly to the growing body of diasporic Singaporean literature, offering narratives that complicate simple representations of Singapore as a gleaming, efficient city-state. Through her unflinching exploration of class tensions, gender politics, racial dynamics, and the clash between tradition and modernity, she has provided readers worldwide with a more nuanced understanding of Singaporean society.[^51]

Her influence extends beyond her published works to her role as an educator and mentor. As the inaugural George R.R. Martin Chair in Storytelling, Tan shapes the next generation of journalists and storytellers, bringing her unique perspective as a woman of color, an immigrant, and a practitioner of both journalism and creative writing. Her workshops on memoir writing, food writing, and mining family history for stories have helped numerous emerging writers find their voices.[^52]

The National Arts Council of Singapore's multiple grants to Tan signify official recognition of her contributions to Singaporean literature, even when her work has sparked controversy at home. This support reflects an acknowledgment that authentic representation sometimes requires uncomfortable truths and challenging perspectives.[^53]

Tan's editorial work, particularly *Singapore Noir* and *Anonymous Sex*, demonstrates her commitment to elevating diverse voices and pushing literary boundaries. Under her tutelage and editorial vision, these anthologies have "punctured the stereotypes associated with Singapore" and "pushed the genre in new directions," according to scholars studying her impact.[^54]

Her dual identity as both a successful mainstream American journalist and a distinctly Singaporean literary voice has created a model for other immigrant writers navigating multiple cultural identities. She has shown that one need not choose between identities but can instead leverage the richness that comes from inhabiting multiple worlds simultaneously.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Literary critics and scholars have praised Tan for her contributions to Asian American literature and her role in legitimizing Singlish as a literary language. Kirkus Reviews lauded her "fascinating insight into Singapore's club scene and social castes" achieved through "rowdy tale, memorable language, and a very distinctive protagonist." Ruth Ozeki called *Sarong Party Girls* "Utterly irresistible," while celebrated travel writer Paul Theroux described it as "hilarious and original" and "deeply subversive."[^55][^56]

Scholar and novelist Hillary Jordan positioned Tan's work as "a stinging and deliciously subversive critique of Singapore's patriarchal social system," recognizing the feminist underpinnings of her seemingly lighthearted narrative. The Slate review praised how Tan "astutely illustrates" the protagonist's journey and her ability to "throw that door open" on stories that haven't been told in literature.[^57]

Academic researchers examining diasporic Singaporean literature have noted Tan's sophisticated use of stereotypes to "lend fixity to the hybrid, unstable nature of Singaporean identity" and to negotiate "the boundaries and consumption of postcolonial literary authorship." This scholarly attention suggests her work will continue to be studied as an important contribution to postcolonial literature.[^58]

Her memoir *A Tiger in the Kitchen* has been celebrated for its warmth and accessibility. Library Journal called it "A warm, witty chronicle of growing up and finding one's place between cultures," while the Atlanta Journal-Constitution described it as "an important food memoir and relatable to anyone who feels something missing from their own lives." The memoir has been compared favorably to beloved works like "Eat, Pray, Love" and "Julie & Julia."[^59][^60]

George R.R. Martin's personal attendance at Tan's investiture ceremony and his establishment of the storytelling chair she now holds represent powerful endorsements of her expertise and influence in the field of narrative storytelling.[^61]

### Negative Views

Critics of Tan's work have raised concerns about her representation of Singaporean women and culture. Some reviewers found the protagonist of *Sarong Party Girls* to be "vapid" and "unlikeable," questioning whether the character's materialism, casual racism, and judgmental attitudes reinforce negative stereotypes rather than critique them. These critics argue that international readers unfamiliar with Singapore might take Jazzy as representative of Singaporean women generally, potentially perpetuating harmful misconceptions.[^62]

The novel's exclusion from the Singapore Writers Festival sparked debate about whether Tan's work serves Singapore's interests or exploits Singaporean culture for Western audiences. Some in Singapore's literary establishment have questioned whether diasporic writers like Tan, who have spent significant time abroad, can authentically represent contemporary Singaporean life or whether their perspectives are inevitably distorted by their distance and Western perspectives.[^63]

The use of Singlish, while praised by some, has been criticized by others as potentially limiting the novel's accessibility and reinforcing linguistic hierarchies. Some educators and language advocates in Singapore have expressed concern that celebrating Singlish in literature could undermine efforts to maintain high standards of English proficiency, which they view as essential to Singapore's economic competitiveness.[^64]

Some readers have noted that Tan's work focuses heavily on negative aspects of Singaporean culture—materialism, status obsession, racial prejudice, and patriarchal attitudes—while giving less attention to positive developments and progressive movements within Singapore. Critics argue this creates an unbalanced portrait that may serve Western stereotypes about Asian societies being backward or oppressive.[^65]

Her father's disapproving reaction to *Sarong Party Girls* reflects a broader generational and cultural divide, with some older Singaporeans viewing her work as disrespectful to Singaporean culture and values, particularly regarding women's behavior and language use.[^66]
