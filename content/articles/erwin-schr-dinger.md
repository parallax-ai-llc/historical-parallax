## Summary

Erwin Schrödinger was an Austrian-Irish physicist who developed the wave equation that bears his name, a fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. He shared the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics with Paul Dirac. His famous thought experiment, Schrödinger's cat, illustrates the paradoxes of quantum superposition. He also made significant contributions to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.
