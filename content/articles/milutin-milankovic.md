## Summary

Milutin Milanković was a Serbian mathematician and astronomer who developed the theory of Milankovitch cycles, which explains how variations in Earth's orbit (eccentricity, obliquity, and precession) cause ice ages and long-term climate change. His mathematical model, initially dismissed, was confirmed by deep-sea sediment studies in the 1970s and is now fundamental to climate science.
