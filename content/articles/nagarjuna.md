## Summary

Nāgārjuna (c. 150–250 CE) stands as the most important Buddhist philosopher after the historical Buddha himself and one of the most original and influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy.[^1][^2] Born into a Brahmin family in South India, he founded the Madhyamaka (Middle Way) school of Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy and systematically developed the doctrine of emptiness (śūnyatā).[^3][^4] His magnum opus, the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (Root Verses on the Middle Way), revolutionized Buddhist thought and influenced philosophical discourse in India for over a millennium, later becoming foundational to Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Buddhist traditions.[^5][^6] Often called "the second Buddha," Nagarjuna's radical critique of substantialist philosophy challenged fundamental assumptions about causation, identity, and reality itself.[^7][^8]

## Early Life and Background

Nāgārjuna was born around 150 CE into an upper-caste Brahmin family in the southern Andhra region of India, in what is today the border area between Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.[^9][^10] According to traditional Tibetan and Chinese hagiographies, a soothsayer predicted at his birth that he would live only seven days, but through his parents' offerings to Buddhist monks, his lifespan was extended to seven years.[^11] Fearing for their son's life when he reached that age, his parents sent the young Nagarjuna to the great monastic university of Nalanda in northern India, where he would eventually find not only physical safety but spiritual awakening.[^12]

At Nalanda, Nagarjuna encountered the transformative teachings of Buddhism and studied under illustrious masters including Ratnamati, considered an emanation of Manjushri, and the renowned tantric adept Saraha.[^13][^14] Under their tutelage, he immersed himself in both sutra and tantra, with particular emphasis on texts like the Guhyasamaja Tantra.[^15] The young scholar demonstrated exceptional intellectual prowess, quickly mastering the vast corpus of Buddhist literature available at what was then the world's premier center of Buddhist learning.[^16]

Very little can be said with historical certainty concerning Nagarjuna's early life, as the majority of biographical details transmitted through later writers such as Kumārajīva, Bu ston, and Tāranātha exhibit surprisingly little agreement with each other and are largely hagiographical in nature.[^17][^18] What remains clear is that Nagarjuna's Brahmanical education would profoundly shape his later philosophical methodology, as he employed rigorous logical analysis learned from the Hindu philosophical schools to systematically deconstruct the very foundations of substantialist metaphysics that characterized both Buddhist Abhidharma and Brahmanical thought.[^19][^20]

The transformation from a "Hindu" allegiant to Vedic authority into Buddhism's greatest systematic philosopher represents one of the most significant intellectual conversions in world philosophy.[^21] His background in Brahmanical learning gave him unique insights into the philosophical assumptions underlying Indian thought, which he would later subject to devastating critique through his distinctive dialectical method.[^22]

## Rise to Prominence

Nagarjuna's rise to philosophical prominence occurred during the crucial formative period of Mahāyāna Buddhism in the second century CE, when the new movement needed systematic philosophical articulation to compete with established Abhidharma schools and Brahmanical systems.[^23][^24] His genius lay in transforming the Prajñāpāramitā sutras' poetic and sometimes paradoxical declarations on emptiness into a rigorous philosophical system that could withstand the most penetrating logical scrutiny.[^25][^26]

His reputation grew sufficiently during his lifetime that he became abbot of Nalanda monastery, one of the most prestigious positions in the Buddhist world.[^27][^28] From this influential platform, he attracted students from across India and beyond, most notably Aryadeva, who would become his principal disciple and carry forward the Madhyamaka tradition with his own important philosophical texts.[^29][^30] The relationship between Nagarjuna and Aryadeva exemplifies the teacher-disciple lineage central to Buddhist philosophy, with Aryadeva described in traditional sources as Nagarjuna's "spiritual son."[^31]

Two works attributed to Nagarjuna—the Ratnāvalī (Precious Garland) and other verses of advice—were composed for a king, suggesting that he achieved considerable fame extending beyond monastic circles into royal courts.[^32][^33] Scholars generally identify this royal patron as King Sātavāhana of the Satavahana dynasty, which ruled much of central and southern India during this period.[^34][^35] The Ratnāvalī demonstrates Nagarjuna's ability to integrate profound philosophical insights with practical political and ethical advice, addressing questions of statecraft, social welfare, and spiritual development in a single coherent framework.[^36][^37]

The site of Nagarjunakonda (literally "Nagarjuna's Hill") in Andhra Pradesh became associated with the philosopher and commemorates his connection to the region.[^38][^39] This archaeological site, which in ancient times was known as Vijayapuri (City of Victory), housed more than thirty Buddhist monasteries during the early centuries CE and became a major center of Buddhist learning.[^40][^41] Though a modern dam submerged much of the original site in 1960, relocated monuments and a museum preserve the memory of this important Buddhist center where tradition holds that Nagarjuna once taught.[^42][^43]

By the fourth century CE, Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka philosophy had achieved such influence that it fundamentally shaped the subsequent development of Mahāyāna Buddhism throughout Asia.[^44][^45] His works were translated into Chinese, Tibetan, and other languages, ensuring that his philosophical innovations would reach far beyond the Indian subcontinent.[^46]

## Major Achievements

### The Mūlamadhyamakakārikā and Madhyamaka Philosophy

Nagarjuna's supreme achievement was the composition of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā (MMK), or Root Verses on the Middle Way, which stands as the most important text on Madhyamaka philosophy and one of the most influential philosophical works ever written.[^47][^48] This text of approximately 450 verses, organized into 27 chapters, systematically examines and deconstructs fundamental categories of existence—causation, motion, perception, time, substance, and self—to demonstrate that all phenomena are empty of svabhāva (intrinsic nature, inherent existence, or self-nature).[^49][^50]

The MMK inspired hundreds of commentaries in Sanskrit, Chinese, Tibetan, Korean, and Japanese over the subsequent two millennia and continues to be intensively studied in contemporary Buddhist and secular philosophical contexts.[^51][^52] Its opening dedicatory verse employs the famous "eight negations" to describe reality: "There is neither cessation nor origination, neither annihilation nor the eternal, neither singularity nor plurality, neither the coming nor the going of any dharma."[^53][^54] This radical apophatic approach aimed to free practitioners from all conceptual elaborations (prapañca) that obscure the true nature of reality.

### The Doctrine of Emptiness (Śūnyatā)

Nagarjuna's primary contribution to Buddhist thought lies in his systematic development of śūnyatā, or emptiness.[^55][^56] For Nagarjuna, all phenomena are without svabhāva and thus without any underlying essence or independent existence.[^57][^58] Critically, emptiness itself is not a metaphysical absolute or substance but rather the interdependent, contingent nature of all things.[^59] His famous verse from MMK chapter 24 declares: "Whatever arises dependently is explained as empty. Thus dependent attribution is the middle way."[^60][^61]

This teaching navigates between the extremes of eternalism (the view that things possess permanent, independent existence) and nihilism (the view that nothing exists at all).[^62][^63] Nagarjuna demonstrates that phenomena exist conventionally through dependent origination while being empty of independent existence ultimately—a perspective that became known as the "middle way" between metaphysical extremes.[^64]

### Two Truths Doctrine

Nagarjuna was instrumental in developing the two truths doctrine, which distinguishes between conventional or superficial truth (saṃvṛtisatya) and ultimate truth (paramārtha satya).[^65][^66] This framework resolves the apparent paradox of how things can be both existent (conventionally) and empty (ultimately). As he states in MMK 24:10: "Without a foundation in the conventional truth, the significance of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the significance of the ultimate, liberation is not achieved."[^67][^68]

This doctrine became foundational for all subsequent Mahāyāna philosophical development, providing a methodological framework for reconciling Buddhist practice and philosophy.[^69]

### Other Philosophical Works

Scholarly consensus attributes six core philosophical works to Nagarjuna that "expound a single, coherent philosophical system": the MMK, Vigrahavyāvartanī (Refutation of Objections), Śūnyatāsaptati (Seventy Verses on Emptiness), Yuktiṣāṣṭika (Sixty Verses on Reasoning), Vaidalyaprakaraṇa (Pulverizing the Categories), and Ratnāvalī (Precious Garland).[^70][^71] Each work approaches the emptiness doctrine from different angles and addresses specific philosophical challenges.

The Vigrahavyāvartanī is particularly significant for its question-and-answer format, in which Nagarjuna systematically refutes objections from both Buddhist and non-Buddhist scholars against his theory of universal emptiness.[^72][^73] This text admirably illustrates Nagarjuna's dialectical method and clarifies crucial aspects of his philosophy, including epistemology and philosophy of language.[^74][^75]

### Foundation of a Philosophical School

Nagarjuna founded the Madhyamaka school, which became one of the two major philosophical traditions of Mahāyāna Buddhism alongside Yogācāra.[^76][^77] His teachings profoundly influenced Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese Chan (Zen), Korean Seon, and Japanese Zen traditions.[^78][^79] Within Tibetan Buddhism, a specific reading called Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka became the official philosophical position and is regarded as "the pinnacle of philosophical sophistication" to the present day.[^80][^81]

### Political and Ethical Philosophy

The Ratnāvalī demonstrates Nagarjuna's contributions beyond pure metaphysics into ethics and political philosophy.[^82][^83] Composed for King Sātavāhana, this masterpiece of Buddhist literature integrates spiritual practice with social and political life.[^84][^85] Nagarjuna's governmental policy recommendations emphasize education, compassionate care for all beings, abolition of the death penalty in favor of criminal reform, and charity for the homeless.[^86][^87] He advised appointing government officials free from selfish motivations, arguing that greed for profit or fame leads to misfortune.[^88] This text remains influential as "the greatest Buddhist treatise on statecraft" and "a brilliant exposition of the deep connections between emptiness and ethical practice."[^89]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Accusations of Nihilism

The most persistent and serious criticism leveled against Nagarjuna's philosophy has been the charge of nihilism—the view that nothing truly exists.[^90][^91] This accusation has "a relatively long history, beginning in ancient India and continuing to find supporters nowadays."[^92] Critics argued that if all phenomena are empty of inherent existence, this implies complete negation of reality itself.[^93] Some interpretations saw Madhyamaka as "rank nihilism," despite Nagarjuna himself explicitly placing nihilism as "the fourth limb" of his famous catuskoti (four-cornered logic) and rejecting it as "self-discrepant and thus self-stultifying."[^94][^95]

The nihilism charge was pressed by both Brahmanical opponents and rival Buddhist schools, particularly the Yogācāra tradition, which sought to establish consciousness or mind as ultimately real.[^96] Nagarjuna's defenders, including his disciple Aryadeva and the later commentator Candrakīrti, repeatedly emphasized that emptiness does not mean non-existence but rather the absence of independent, intrinsic nature.[^97][^98]

### The Absolutism Debate

Paradoxically, while some accused Nagarjuna of nihilism, others interpreted his emptiness doctrine as pointing toward "some sort of Absolute Reality."[^99][^100] Scholars such as T.R.V. Murti characterized emptiness as "a Buddhist transcendental absolute," interpreting Nagarjuna through a neo-Kantian lens that posited ultimate truth as a metaphysical noumenon.[^101][^102] However, other scholars like David Kalupahana "consider this claim a mistake, since then emptiness teachings could not be characterized as a middle way."[^103]

This interpretive split continues in modern scholarship, with some seeing Nagarjuna as a mystical absolutist pointing toward ineffable reality, while others view him as a therapeutic skeptic dismantling all metaphysical positions without advocating any positive doctrine.[^104]

### Rejection of Philosophical Convention

Nagarjuna's philosophical stance "satisfied no one in the Indian philosophical tradition, neither Brahmanas nor fellow Buddhists" because he styled himself as "a vaitandika, a person who refutes rival philosophical positions while advocating no thesis themselves."[^105][^106] This approach violated the accepted rules of Indian philosophical debate, which required that one defend a positive position (paksha) while attacking opponents.[^107] Both Brahmanical and Buddhist philosophers "did not consider such a stance to be truly philosophical," viewing it instead as mere destructive criticism without constructive content.[^108][^109]

This methodological controversy persists in contemporary scholarship, with debate over whether Nagarjuna truly advances no theses or whether his apparent lack of position is itself a sophisticated philosophical stance.[^110]

### Interpretive Difficulties and Scholarly Disagreement

The terse, aphoristic nature of Nagarjuna's verses has "led to many interpretive challenges and widespread disagreement over the interpretation of some verses and concepts (like the notion of 'emptiness' itself)."[^111][^112] It is "not always apparent what is intended in a set of verses," making commentary literature essential but also contributing to divergent schools of interpretation.[^113]

Since the 20th century, Madhyamaka doctrine has been "variously described as nihilism, monism, irrationalism, misology, agnosticism, skepticism, criticism, dialectic, mysticism, acosmia, absolutism, relativism, nominalism, and linguistic analysis with therapeutic values."[^114] This bewildering array of interpretations reflects both the sophistication and the ambiguity of Nagarjuna's philosophical project.[^115]

### Misrepresentations

Both the commentator Candrakīrti and contemporary philosopher Jay Garfield agree that "the most common misrepresentations of Nagarjuna" include the claims that he taught "that everything is imaginary, nor that objective reality does not exist or that external reality does not exist."[^116][^117] These misunderstandings typically result from mistaking conventional existence for ultimate existence or confusing emptiness with complete non-being.[^118]

### The Multiple Nagarjunas Problem

Historical and textual scholarship faces the challenge of potentially multiple figures named Nagarjuna.[^119] Traditional biographies attribute both philosophical works and later Tantric texts to a single Nagarjuna who allegedly lived for 600 years.[^120] Modern scholars generally distinguish between Arya Nagarjuna, the second-century Madhyamaka philosopher, and Siddha Nagarjuna, a later Tantric Buddhist author and alchemist.[^121][^122] This confusion complicates attempts to determine which works can be reliably attributed to the historical philosopher.[^123]

---

## Personal Life

Historical sources provide remarkably little reliable information about Nagarjuna's personal life, with most biographical details deriving from hagiographical accounts written centuries after his death.[^124][^125] The earliest surviving accounts were composed in Chinese and Tibetan and are "mostly hagiographical accounts that are historically unverifiable."[^126] Nevertheless, certain elements appear consistently across multiple sources and likely preserve authentic historical memory.

Nagarjuna was born into a Brahmin family in South India, probably in the Vidarbha region spanning present-day Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.[^127][^128] His given name relates to the nāga (serpent) motif prevalent in Buddhist iconography, and later legends surrounded him with supernatural associations connected to nagas and esoteric knowledge.[^129] Traditional accounts state that his parents, fearing the soothsayer's prediction of his early death, made extraordinary efforts to preserve his life through Buddhist devotion.[^130]

After joining the Buddhist sangha in childhood, Nagarjuna spent his formative years at Nalanda monastery, which would remain his institutional home throughout his career.[^131][^132] He eventually rose to become abbot of Nalanda, indicating not only philosophical brilliance but also administrative capability and respect within the monastic community.[^133][^134] As abbot, he would have been responsible for the education and spiritual development of hundreds or thousands of monks, the maintenance of monastic discipline, and relationships with royal patrons.[^135]

His most significant personal relationship in the historical record is with his principal student Aryadeva, who was born into a Brahmin family in South India and became known as Nagarjuna's "spiritual son."[^136][^137] This teacher-disciple relationship proved crucial for the transmission of Madhyamaka philosophy, as Aryadeva composed important works including the Four Hundred Verse Treatise on the Actions of a Bodhisattva's Yoga, which systematized and expanded upon his teacher's insights.[^138][^139]

Nagarjuna's relationship with King Sātavāhana suggests a personality capable of moving between monastic, scholarly, and royal contexts.[^140][^141] The Ratnāvalī's sophisticated integration of metaphysics, ethics, and political philosophy indicates a thinker who could communicate profound ideas to diverse audiences and saw practical application of Buddhist principles as integral to the philosophical project.[^142][^143]

Later Tibetan and tantric traditions associate Nagarjuna with alchemical practices, depicting him as a siddha (accomplished adept) who practiced ayurvedic alchemy (rasayana) and possessed supernatural powers.[^144][^145] These accounts claim he invented processes of distillation and calcination, practiced transmutation of base metals into gold, and achieved longevity through alchemical elixirs based on mercury.[^146][^147] While modern scholarship typically attributes these traditions to a later Tantric figure also named Nagarjuna, they reflect the reverence in which Nagarjuna's name was held and the desire to associate him with esoteric knowledge and spiritual accomplishment.[^148][^149]

## Legacy

Nagarjuna's influence on Buddhism and world philosophy cannot be overstated. His philosophy of the "middle way" based on emptiness influenced Indian philosophical debate for over a millennium after his death, and with Buddhism's spread to Tibet, China, Japan, Korea, and other Asian countries, his writings "became an indispensable point of reference for their own philosophical inquiries."[^150][^151] In Tibetan and East Asian traditions, he is reverently called "the second Buddha," a title reflecting his fundamental importance in shaping Mahāyāna Buddhism.[^152][^153]

### Influence on Buddhist Traditions

Madhyamaka philosophy obtained a central position in all the main Tibetan Buddhist schools, all of whom "consider themselves to be madhyamikas."[^154] The Gelugpa school in particular developed the Prāsaṅgika-Madhyamaka interpretation, which became Tibetan Buddhism's official philosophical position and is considered the highest philosophical view.[^155][^156] Great Tibetan masters like Tsongkhapa wrote extensive commentaries on Nagarjuna's works, ensuring their continued study across the Himalayan Buddhist world.[^157]

In East Asia, Nagarjuna's thought deeply influenced Chinese Buddhism, particularly the Tiantai and Huayan schools, which integrated his emptiness doctrine with indigenous Chinese philosophical concepts.[^158] Chan (Zen) Buddhism absorbed Madhyamaka insights into its practice-oriented approach, with masters frequently citing Nagarjuna's verses.[^159] Japanese Buddhism similarly incorporated his teachings, with all major schools—Tendai, Shingon, Pure Land, and Zen—acknowledging his foundational importance.[^160]

### Impact on Philosophical Discourse

Nagarjuna's philosophy "represents something of a watershed not only in the history of Indian philosophy but in the history of philosophy as a whole, as it calls into questions certain philosophical assumptions so easily resorted to in our attempt to understand the world."[^161] Among these challenged assumptions are the existence of stable substances, the linear and unidirectional movement of causation, the atomic individuality of persons, fixed identity or selfhood, and strict separations between good and bad conduct.[^162][^163]

His approach "set a high standard for Buddhist philosophical debate and remains influential in contemporary Buddhist scholarship."[^164] The influence of the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā on Mahāyāna thought is "immeasurable," and the work "has influenced two thousand years of Buddhist thought and continues to stimulate modern intellectual and existential exploration."[^165][^166]

### Modern Academic Reception

Contemporary Western philosophy has engaged seriously with Nagarjuna's thought, finding resonances with various philosophical movements including phenomenology, existentialism, pragmatism, and ordinary language philosophy.[^167] Scholars have explored connections between Nagarjuna and Western thinkers like Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Derrida, and Nietzsche, though such comparisons remain controversial.[^168]

### Influence Beyond Philosophy

Remarkably, Nagarjuna's work has influenced modern neuroscience. Francisco Varela, one of the most influential neuroscientists of modern times and pioneer of embodied cognition, "derived great inspiration from the works of Nagarjuna, particularly his approach to groundlessness and dependent arising."[^169] This cross-disciplinary influence demonstrates the continued relevance of Nagarjuna's insights for contemporary scientific and philosophical inquiry.[^170]

### Physical Legacy

The site of Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh preserves the memory of his connection to South India, despite the 1960 flooding that submerged the original site.[^171][^172] Relocated Buddhist monuments and a museum continue to attract scholars, practitioners, and tourists.[^173] The Andhra Pradesh government recently allocated land at Nagarjunakonda for a National Academy for Rural Buddhist Heritage Conservation and Development, ensuring continued engagement with this important historical site.[^174]

### Continuing Study and Practice

Monks and scholars throughout history have studied Nagarjuna's works deeply, producing hundreds of commentaries and expanding upon his ideas.[^175] The MMK alone generated a vast exegetical tradition, with major commentaries by Buddhapalita, Bhāvaviveka, Candrakīrti, and numerous Tibetan and East Asian scholars.[^176] His thought "continues to shape contemporary Buddhist philosophy, dialogue with Western philosophy, and meditation practice."[^177][^178]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

There exists "unanimous agreement that Nāgārjuna (ca 150–250 CE) is the most important Buddhist philosopher after the historical Buddha himself and one of the most original and influential thinkers in the history of Indian philosophy."[^179][^180] This extraordinary consensus across Buddhist traditions and modern secular scholarship reflects the profundity and enduring relevance of his philosophical contribution.[^181]

The great scholar Nagarjuna is "revered as an unsurpassed master by all Buddhist schools."[^182] His systematic articulation of emptiness provided Mahāyāna Buddhism with philosophical foundations that could withstand rigorous logical scrutiny from rival schools.[^183] Scholars praise his dialectical brilliance, noting that he effectively employed the logical methods of his opponents to deconstruct their own substantialist positions.[^184]

Jan Westerhoff, in his comprehensive study *Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka*, argues that Nagarjuna developed a sophisticated philosophical system addressing metaphysics, epistemology, and logic with remarkable coherence and depth.[^185] Modern interpreters like Jay Garfield emphasize Nagarjuna's therapeutic approach to philosophy, seeing him as diagnosing and treating the conceptual reification that causes suffering.[^186]

Defenders of Nagarjuna argue that his refusal to advocate positive theses was not philosophical cowardice but profound wisdom, recognizing that all conceptual positions ultimately reify and distort reality.[^187] His "middle way" successfully navigates between eternalism and nihilism, offering a philosophically sophisticated account of how things can exist conventionally while being empty ultimately.[^188]

The Ratnāvalī is celebrated as demonstrating that Nagarjuna's philosophy was not merely abstract metaphysics but deeply engaged with ethics, politics, and practical human flourishing.[^189] His advice on governance, emphasizing compassion, education, and rejection of violence, presents a Buddhist vision of enlightened statecraft that remains relevant for contemporary political philosophy.[^190]

Nagarjuna's influence on meditation practice is also celebrated, as his philosophical insights into emptiness directly inform practices aimed at liberation from suffering.[^191] The integration of rigorous philosophy with soteriological practice exemplifies the Buddhist ideal of unity between wisdom and compassion.[^192]

### Negative Views

Critics, both ancient and modern, have persistently charged Nagarjuna's philosophy with nihilism, arguing that universal emptiness implies the non-existence of everything, including ethical distinctions, causation, and spiritual progress.[^193][^194] If nothing has inherent existence, critics ask, what grounds ethics, what motivates practice, and what could liberation possibly mean?[^195] This criticism was particularly forceful from Buddhist Abhidharma schools and Yogācāra philosophers who sought to establish some ultimately real basis for Buddhist practice and philosophy.[^196]

Brahmanical philosophers dismissed Nagarjuna's approach as sophistry rather than genuine philosophy, arguing that his refusal to defend positive theses violated the basic requirements of rational discourse.[^197][^198] His dialectical method of prasaṅga (reductio ad absurdum) was seen as merely destructive, offering criticism without constructive alternatives.[^199]

Some scholars argue that Nagarjuna's philosophy leads to a problematic relativism where all views are equally empty and thus equally valid or invalid.[^200] This interpretation suggests that Madhyamaka undermines the possibility of distinguishing truth from falsehood, wisdom from delusion.[^201]

Modern critics like Matthew Kapstein have questioned whether Nagarjuna's arguments are as devastating as his defenders claim, suggesting that more charitable interpretations of the positions he attacks might withstand his critique.[^202] Some philosophers argue that his reasoning commits fallacies or relies on questionable assumptions about language and logic.[^203]

The textual and interpretive difficulties surrounding Nagarjuna's works have led some scholars to question whether a single, coherent philosophical system can be extracted from the various texts attributed to him.[^204] The "multiple Nagarjunas" problem complicates efforts to definitively establish what the historical philosopher actually taught.[^205]

Critics of the absolutist interpretation, like David Kalupahana, argue that reading Nagarjuna as pointing toward a transcendent absolute betrays his explicit rejection of all metaphysical views and transforms his philosophy into the very essentialism he sought to demolish.[^206] Conversely, critics of purely therapeutic or skeptical readings argue that these interpretations fail to account for Nagarjuna's positive commitments to dependent origination and the two truths.[^207]

Some contemporary scholars argue that the reverence surrounding Nagarjuna in Buddhist tradition has inhibited critical examination of his arguments and prevented recognition of genuine weaknesses in his philosophical system.[^208] They suggest that hagiographical treatment obscures both historical reality and philosophical limitations.[^209]
