## Summary

Alija Izetbegović (1925-2003) was a Bosnian lawyer, political theorist, and statesman who served as the first president of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1990 to 1996, and later as the first chairman of the presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A complex and controversial figure, he led Bosnia through its independence from Yugoslavia and the devastating Bosnian War (1992-1995), emerging as a symbol of Bosniak resistance and multi-ethnic coexistence. Known to supporters as the "Wise King," Izetbegović authored influential Islamic political works that led to his imprisonment under communist Yugoslavia, yet he consistently advocated for a multi-ethnic Bosnian state. His legacy remains deeply contested, viewed by admirers as a defender of Bosnia's sovereignty and by critics as an Islamic fundamentalist responsible for war crimes.[^1][^2][^3]

---

## Early Life and Background

Alija Izetbegović was born on August 8, 1925, in the town of Bosanski Šamac, in what was then the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). He came from a distinguished and devout Muslim family with deep roots in the region. His paternal grandfather, also named Alija, had served as a soldier in Üsküdar while in service of the Ottoman Empire, where he married a Turkish woman named Sıdıka Hanım. The couple eventually settled in Bosanski Šamac, where the grandfather became the town's mayor and raised five children.[^4][^5]

Izetbegović's father worked as an accountant and had served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I, fighting on the Italian Front. He sustained serious injuries during the war that left him in a semi-paralyzed state for at least a decade, profoundly affecting the family's circumstances. Alija was the fifth child in his family, born into what was initially a well-to-do household. However, financial difficulties struck when Izetbegović was just a toddler—his father declared bankruptcy in 1927, forcing the family to relocate.[^6][^7]

In 1928, when Alija was approximately three years old, the Izetbegović family moved to Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. This move would prove formative, as Sarajevo was a cosmopolitan city where Muslim, Orthodox Christian, Catholic, and Jewish communities had coexisted for centuries. Young Alija received all of his education in Sarajevo, attending the city's prestigious First Real Gymnasium for Boys, from which he graduated in 1943 during the tumultuous years of World War II and the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia.[^8]

The wartime period profoundly shaped Izetbegović's worldview and political consciousness. As a teenager during the war, he witnessed the complex ethnic and religious tensions that would later define his political career. In 1944, at the age of 18, he met Halida Repovac, his future wife, whose two brothers had been killed while serving in the resistance movement against the Axis occupation. This personal connection to the wartime resistance movement deepened his awareness of the sacrifices made during the struggle.[^9]

Following his graduation from gymnasium, Izetbegović initially pursued agricultural studies for three years at an agronomy school. However, his educational trajectory was dramatically interrupted when he was arrested during his military service in the Yugoslav Army. As a member of the 'Young Muslims' (Mladi Muslimani) movement—a pan-Islamic organization that sought to preserve Islamic identity in communist Yugoslavia—Izetbegović was sentenced to three years in prison from 1946 to 1949. This first imprisonment, at the young age of 21, would be a formative experience that hardened his resolve and deepened his commitment to Islamic political thought.[^10][^11]

After his release from prison in 1949, Izetbegović resumed his education, initially continuing with agronomy studies. However, in his third year, he made the decisive choice to switch to law, enrolling at the University of Sarajevo's Faculty of Law. Demonstrating exceptional academic ability, he completed his law degree within just two years, graduating in 1956. He subsequently worked as a legal consultant and lawyer in Sarajevo, establishing a successful practice that would provide him with financial stability and professional respect within the community.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Izetbegović's path to political prominence was marked by decades of intellectual activism, persecution, and unwavering commitment to Islamic political philosophy. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, while working as a lawyer, he dedicated himself to writing and developing his political and religious ideas. This period of intellectual ferment culminated in the publication of his most controversial work, the "Islamic Declaration" (Islamska deklaracija), published in 1970 in Sarajevo.[^13]

The Islamic Declaration was a comprehensive essay that presented Izetbegović's vision for reconciling Western-style progress with Islamic tradition and issued a call for "Islamic renewal" throughout the Muslim world. The document argued that Islam constitutes a total system encompassing political, social, economic, and cultural life, fundamentally incompatible with Western secularism, communism, or other non-Islamic ideologies. Izetbegović wrote that an Islamic government could only be realized in nations where Muslims represented the absolute majority of the population, and that such a state should be "an expression of religion and should support its moral concepts."[^14][^15]

Critically, the Islamic Declaration never explicitly mentioned Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Izetbegović later insisted repeatedly that the statements about creating an Islamic state were hypothetical and theoretical, not intended to be applied to Bosnia's multi-ethnic context. Nevertheless, the work attracted the hostile attention of Yugoslavia's communist authorities, who viewed it as seditious and a call for the imposition of Sharia law.[^16]

For more than a decade, Izetbegović continued his legal practice and intellectual work without further major incident. However, in 1983, the Yugoslav government launched a major trial against him and twelve other Bosniak activists, charging them with Muslim nationalism, sedition, and "hostile and counterrevolutionary acts derived from Muslim nationalism." The Islamic Declaration served as primary evidence against him. In what was widely seen as a political show trial designed to suppress Bosniak national consciousness, Izetbegović was sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment.[^17][^18]

The sentence was later reduced on appeal, first to twelve years and then to nine years. Izetbegović served his time in various Yugoslav prisons, becoming a symbol of resistance for Bosnia's Muslim community. His imprisonment drew international attention, and human rights organizations criticized the Yugoslav government for persecuting him for his religious and political beliefs. After serving approximately five years, Izetbegović was released from prison on November 25, 1988, amid the broader political liberalization occurring throughout Eastern Europe as communist systems began to collapse.[^19]

His release came at a pivotal moment in Yugoslav history. The introduction of a multi-party political system in Yugoslavia at the end of the 1980s created new opportunities for political organization. In May 1990, Izetbegović and other Bosniak activists seized this opportunity to establish the Party of Democratic Action (Stranka Demokratske Akcije, or SDA), a political party primarily representing Bosnia's Muslim population but officially committed to multi-ethnic cooperation. The party's founding represented the political mobilization of Bosnia's Muslims in response to rising Serbian and Croatian nationalism.[^20][^21]

The first multi-party elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina were held in November 1990. The results largely followed ethnic lines, with the SDA winning the Muslim vote, the Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) winning among Serbs, and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) winning among Croats. A tripartite coalition government was formed representing all three major ethnic groups. On December 20, 1990, at the age of sixty-five, Izetbegović was unanimously selected by the newly elected collective presidency to serve as its president, making him the de facto head of state of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Izetbegović's most significant achievement was navigating Bosnia and Herzegovina to independence and defending its sovereignty during the catastrophic war that followed. As Yugoslavia disintegrated in 1991 with the declarations of independence by Slovenia and Croatia, Bosnia faced an impossible choice: remain in a Serb-dominated Yugoslavia or seek independence and risk war. Izetbegović initially attempted to maintain neutrality, giving a televised proclamation in October 1991 that included the famous statement "it is not our war," referring to the conflicts in Slovenia and Croatia.[^23]

However, the political situation became untenable. The Bosnian parliament, which had been vacated by Bosnian Serb representatives who opposed independence, formally declared independence from Yugoslavia on February 29, 1992. This declaration was supported by a referendum held on February 29 and March 1, 1992, in which 99.7% of voters supported independence, though the referendum was boycotted by the majority of Bosnian Serbs. Izetbegović officially announced the country's independence on March 3, 1992, and the international community recognized Bosnia and Herzegovina as an independent state in early April 1992.[^24][^25]

Recognition brought legitimacy but not security. Izetbegović appears to have gambled that international recognition would be accompanied by a peacekeeping force to prevent war, but this did not materialize. On April 6, 1992, war erupted as Serbian forces, supported by the Yugoslav People's Army and paramilitary units, launched attacks throughout Bosnia. At the outbreak of war, Izetbegović was president of a country that had virtually no army. As he later reflected, "If a conventional war means a conflict between two armies, then the war in Bosnia was not conventional in its early stages. It was the assault of a powerful war machine on an unarmed people. The goal was to create Greater Serbia."[^26]

Despite the desperate military situation, Izetbegović achieved remarkable success as an international advocate for Bosnia's cause. Throughout the war from 1992 to 1995, he was extraordinarily effective in representing Bosnia in international politics, traveling to the United Nations, meeting with world leaders, and consistently articulating the case for Bosnia as a multi-ethnic state under attack from Serbian and Croatian nationalist forces seeking to partition the country. His advocacy helped maintain international support for Bosnia, though it never translated into the robust military intervention he sought.[^27]

Militarily, Izetbegović oversaw the creation of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH), which began as a poorly equipped and disorganized force but gradually developed into a more effective fighting force. Initially, Bosnian government forces cooperated with Croatian forces against the Serbs, but this alliance collapsed in 1993 when a separate war erupted between Bosniaks and Croats over territorial control. Izetbegović's political and military leadership during this period, when Bosnia faced enemies on multiple fronts, demonstrated considerable strategic acumen.[^28]

One of Izetbegović's key achievements was his ability to successfully balance and manipulate relationships with Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević and Croatian leader Franjo Tuđman. Both neighboring countries harbored territorial ambitions toward Bosnia, yet Izetbegović managed to prevent the complete partition of Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia—an outcome that many international observers had predicted as inevitable. His diplomatic maneuvering ensured that Bosnia would survive as an independent state, albeit in a radically transformed configuration.[^29]

The culmination of Izetbegović's wartime leadership came with the Dayton Peace Accords, negotiated at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio from November 1-21, 1995. U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke had pressured Izetbegović, along with Milošević and Tuđman, to attend the intensive three-week negotiation process. For Izetbegović, the negotiations were extraordinarily difficult. The Bosnian Muslims considered themselves victims who had suffered tremendous loss of life, yet Izetbegović recognized that peace was the greater imperative despite the painful compromises it would require.[^30][^31]

The agreement was deeply unsatisfying to Izetbegović because it required sharing power with Bosnian Serb leaders whom he considered war criminals and legitimized the territorial gains made through ethnic cleansing. According to those present at Dayton, Izetbegović feared he would not be able to carry his people with him in accepting peace, that many would prefer to continue fighting. When he signed the agreement, he stated: "My government is taking part in this agreement without any enthusiasm, but as someone taking a bitter yet useful potion or medication."[^32]

Nevertheless, recent historical assessments suggest the Dayton Agreement stands as a significant diplomatic achievement for Izetbegović, who secured a comparatively more favorable outcome for Bosnia than many had thought possible given the military situation. The agreement preserved Bosnia and Herzegovina as a single, internationally recognized state, prevented its partition between Serbia and Croatia, and established a framework, however imperfect, for multi-ethnic governance.[^33]

Following Dayton, Izetbegović served as a member of the three-person collective presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina established by the agreement. He was elected as the Bosniak member and served as the chairman of the presidency in rotating terms. He continued in this role until stepping down in October 2000 at the age of 74, citing poor health. His peaceful transfer of power represented an important moment for Bosnia's democratic development.[^34]

Beyond politics, Izetbegović was a prolific author whose intellectual contributions extended far beyond the Islamic Declaration. His most significant work was "Islam Between East and West" (Islam između Istoka i Zapada), a philosophical treatise that explored the relationship between Islamic civilization and Western modernity. The book examined Islam's unique position between Eastern spirituality and Western materialism, arguing for Islam's capacity to synthesize the best elements of both traditions. This work gained international recognition and has been translated into numerous languages, establishing Izetbegović as an important Muslim intellectual of the twentieth century.[^35]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Izetbegović remains one of the most controversial figures in Balkan history, and accusations against him range from Islamic fundamentalism to responsibility for war crimes. The most serious allegations concern war crimes committed by forces under his nominal command during the Bosnian War. Bosnian Serb authorities and some international observers claimed that Izetbegović bore responsibility for atrocities committed by Bosniak forces against Serb and Croat civilians, and they provided documentation to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) attempting to have him formally indicted.[^36]

During various war crimes trials at The Hague, Bosnian Serbs and Croats made accusations of genocide and crimes against humanity against Izetbegović. However, the ICTY never issued an indictment against him, citing insufficient evidence to support the allegations. Former ICTY Chief Prosecutor Carla del Ponte reportedly stated that Izetbegović's death in 2003 prevented him from potentially standing trial, though this remains disputed and the tribunal never formally pursued charges against him during his lifetime.[^37]

A particular source of controversy was the role of foreign mujahideen fighters in Bosnia. During the war, several thousand foreign Islamic fighters from various countries, many with connections to extremist networks including Al-Qaeda, traveled to Bosnia to fight alongside Bosniak forces. These fighters were incorporated into units such as the Third Corps of the Seventh Muslim Mountain Brigade and the Tenth Muslim Brigade. These units are suspected of committing serious war crimes and crimes against humanity against Croatian and Serbian civilians and prisoners of war.[^38]

The most notorious incident involved the presence of Osama bin Laden in Bosnia. Multiple sources indicate that bin Laden visited Izetbegović in Sarajevo during the war, and Al-Qaeda provided financial and material support to Bosniak forces. Many secular Bosnian Muslim officers had grave reservations about these foreign fighters and their extremist ideology, which was alien to Bosnia's traditionally moderate Islamic culture. Critics argue that Izetbegović's willingness to accept support from radical Islamist networks demonstrated either poor judgment or genuine sympathy for Islamic fundamentalism.[^39]

The Islamic Declaration continues to haunt Izetbegović's legacy. Critics, particularly among Bosnian Serbs and Croats, cite the document as definitive proof that Izetbegović harbored fundamentalist intentions to create an Islamic state in Bosnia. The declaration's statement that "there can be no peace or coexistence between the Islamic faith and non-Islamic social and political institutions" has been repeatedly invoked as evidence of his religious extremism and incompatibility with multi-ethnic coexistence.[^40]

Izetbegović's defenders argue that the Islamic Declaration was a theoretical work about general Islamic political philosophy, not a blueprint for Bosnia, which was never mentioned in the text. They point out that his actual policies as president consistently supported multi-ethnic governance and that he never attempted to implement Sharia law or create an Islamic state. Nevertheless, the document's existence and its uncompromising language have made it impossible for Izetbegović to escape accusations of fundamentalism.[^41]

Governance failures also marked Izetbegović's presidency. The international community and domestic critics accused his party, the SDA, of endemic corruption, nepotism, and attempting to dominate the supposedly multi-ethnic state apparatus. Izetbegović was criticized for failing to remove corrupt individuals from Muslim-dominated sections of the administration and for allowing the SDA to function more as an instrument of Bosniak nationalism than as a genuinely multi-ethnic party. The parallel institutions created by the SDA in areas under Bosniak control often mirrored the nationalist structures established by Serbian and Croatian parties, undermining the ideal of a unified Bosnian state.[^42]

Some critics within the Bosniak community itself have questioned Izetbegović's strategic decisions during the war. They argue that his refusal to accept various peace proposals in the early stages of the conflict—when Bosnia might have secured more favorable terms—unnecessarily prolonged the war and resulted in tens of thousands of additional deaths. The counterargument is that early peace proposals would have legitimized Serbian territorial conquests and resulted in the de facto partition of Bosnia, which Izetbegović was determined to prevent.[^43]

The Dayton Agreement itself, while ending the war, created a dysfunctional state structure that has plagued Bosnia for decades. Critics argue that Izetbegović accepted an agreement that institutionalized ethnic division, created an unwieldy bureaucracy with multiple layers of government, and made Bosnia virtually ungovernable. The country's subsequent political paralysis and economic stagnation are sometimes attributed to the compromises Izetbegović made at Dayton, though defenders note he had little negotiating leverage given the military situation.[^44]

## Personal Life

Alija Izetbegović married Halida Repovac, whom he had met in 1944 when both were young adults during World War II. Halida came from a family deeply affected by the war—her two brothers had been killed fighting in the resistance movement against the Axis occupation. The couple's shared experiences during the tumultuous war years and the subsequent communist period created a strong bond that lasted throughout their lives. Halida remained a constant presence throughout Izetbegović's long political career, including during his imprisonments and the Bosnian War.[^45]

The couple had three children: two daughters and a son named Bakir. The family maintained a relatively private life despite Izetbegović's increasingly prominent public role. Bakir Izetbegović would later follow his father into politics, entering the political arena after his father's death and eventually serving as a member of the tripartite presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 2010 to 2018, representing the Bosniak community just as his father had done. Alija also had two granddaughters, Jasmina and Mirzeta Izetbegović.[^46]

Those who knew Izetbegović personally often described him as a man of deep religious conviction, intellectual curiosity, and unwavering determination. He was known for his ascetic lifestyle and personal modesty, maintaining relatively simple living arrangements even during his presidency. Unlike many leaders in the former Yugoslavia who accumulated wealth and lived lavishly, Izetbegović reportedly remained personally honest and uninterested in material enrichment, though this did not prevent corruption among his associates and party members.[^47]

Izetbegović was described as soft-spoken and thoughtful in personal interactions, quite different from his sometimes fiery public rhetoric. He was an avid reader and writer who continued his intellectual work throughout his political career, producing essays, speeches, and books even during the chaos of wartime. His philosophical and religious writings reveal a complex thinker grappling with profound questions about Islam's place in the modern world, the nature of civilization, and the relationship between faith and politics.[^48]

Health problems increasingly plagued Izetbegović in his later years. He suffered from advanced heart disease that limited his activities and contributed to his decision to step down from the presidency in October 2000. In October 2003, he suffered a fall in his home that resulted in serious injuries. Given his advanced age of 78 and compromised health, he never recovered from these injuries. Alija Izetbegović died on October 19, 2003, in Sarajevo, from complications related to the fall and his underlying heart condition.[^49]

His funeral was an enormous event in Sarajevo, with tens of thousands of mourners filling the streets to pay their respects. He was buried in the Kovači Cemetery, the historic graveyard that overlooks Sarajevo and contains the graves of numerous important Bosnian figures. The massive public outpouring at his funeral demonstrated his enduring significance to Bosnia's Muslim community, who viewed him as the defender of their existence during the country's darkest hour.[^50]

## Legacy

Alija Izetbegović's legacy is profoundly contested and varies dramatically depending on ethnic, national, and political perspectives. Among Bosniaks, he is predominantly remembered as a hero—the leader who secured Bosnia's independence, defended the country during an existential war, and ensured the survival of the Bosniak people when their very existence was threatened. Supporters often refer to him as the "Wise King" (Mudri Kralj), a title that reflects the reverence in which many Bosniaks hold him.[^51]

His defenders argue that Izetbegović's most enduring legacy is that Bosnia managed to pull a fragile peace from the wreckage of the 1990s and that the multi-ethnic society, despite its wounds and dysfunction, continues to exist. They credit him with maintaining the vision of Bosnia as a multi-ethnic, multi-religious state even when such an ideal seemed impossible to sustain amid the nationalist fervor and ethnic violence of the war. His genius, they argue, was his capacity to unite people under a common idea: that Bosnia deserved to survive.[^52]

Within the broader Muslim world, Izetbegović is remembered as one of the most important Islamic thinkers of the late twentieth century. His books, particularly "Islam Between East and West," continue to be widely read and discussed in Muslim intellectual circles. He is seen as a philosopher who grappled seriously with the challenge of reconciling Islamic values with modernity, democracy, and European identity—questions that remain highly relevant for Muslim-majority societies and Muslim minorities in the West.[^53]

International perspectives on Izetbegović's legacy are more mixed. Some Western observers admire him as a defender of multi-ethnic democracy against nationalist aggression and ethnic cleansing. They view his wartime leadership as courageous and his commitment to a unified Bosnia as principled. Academic studies have increasingly recognized his role in preventing the complete partition of Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia, an outcome that seemed likely and that would have rewarded ethnic cleansing.[^54]

However, other international observers are more critical, viewing Izetbegović as a flawed leader whose Islamic political ideology, tolerance of mujahideen fighters, and occasional nationalist rhetoric contributed to Bosnia's ethnic polarization. Some argue that his unwillingness to accept early peace proposals unnecessarily prolonged the war. The dysfunctional state structure created by the Dayton Agreement, which Izetbegović accepted, is sometimes cited as evidence of failed leadership.[^55]

Among Bosnian Serbs, Izetbegović is generally viewed very negatively, often characterized as an Islamic fundamentalist and war criminal responsible for crimes against Serbian civilians. Serbian nationalist narratives portray him as someone who deliberately destroyed multi-ethnic Yugoslavia in pursuit of an Islamic state, using the Islamic Declaration as primary evidence. Monuments, streets, and institutions named after Izetbegović in Bosniak-controlled areas are sources of deep resentment among many Serbs.[^56]

Bosnian Croats hold similarly negative views, though perhaps less intensely than Serbs. Croatian nationalists criticize Izetbegović for attempting to dominate a Bosniak-controlled unitary state rather than accepting the division of Bosnia into ethnic cantons. The 1993-1994 Bosniak-Croat war left lasting bitterness, and many Croats view Izetbegović as equally responsible for that conflict as Croatian leaders.[^57]

The institutional legacy of Izetbegović is visible throughout Bosnia. The Alija Izetbegović International Airport in Sarajevo bears his name, though this naming was controversial among non-Bosniak communities. Museums, foundations, streets, and schools throughout Bosnia's Federation entity (the Bosniak-Croat half of the country) are named in his honor. An Alija Izetbegović Museum was established in Sarajevo to preserve his writings, personal effects, and document his role in Bosnian history.[^58]

Perhaps the most significant aspect of Izetbegović's legacy is the question he poses to contemporary Bosnia and the broader Balkans: Is multi-ethnic coexistence possible in deeply divided societies? Izetbegović consistently promoted this ideal even as the war seemed to make it impossible. Nearly three decades after Dayton, Bosnia remains a fragile state, ethnically divided and politically dysfunctional, yet it has not collapsed into renewed war. Whether this represents the success or failure of Izetbegović's vision remains a matter of intense debate.[^59]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders of Izetbegović emphasize his role as a philosopher-statesman who attempted to navigate impossible circumstances with principle and pragmatism. Historians sympathetic to the Bosnian cause argue that he faced an unprecedented challenge: defending a multi-ethnic state against two nationalist neighbors with vastly superior military power, while the international community watched but declined to intervene decisively. In this context, they argue, Izetbegović's achievement was simply that Bosnia survived at all.[^60]

Academic supporters point to his consistent advocacy for multi-ethnic coexistence despite the pressures of war. Unlike some nationalist leaders who exploited conflict for personal power, Izetbegović maintained throughout the war that Serbs and Croats were equal citizens of Bosnia. His governments, even during the darkest periods of the war, included Serbian and Croatian members, however symbolic their participation might have been. This commitment to inclusive rhetoric, even when it seemed politically disadvantageous, demonstrates genuine principle according to his defenders.[^61]

Scholars of Islamic political thought regard Izetbegović as a sophisticated thinker who made important contributions to debates about Islam and modernity. His works, particularly "Islam Between East and West," are credited with offering a nuanced perspective that rejects both blind Westernization and reactionary fundamentalism. Experts argue that the Islamic Declaration, read in full rather than through selective quotations, reveals a complex political philosophy rather than a fundamentalist manifesto, and that using it to condemn Izetbegović is intellectually dishonest.[^62]

Some international relations scholars credit Izetbegović with skillful diplomatic maneuvering that kept Bosnia's cause alive in international forums even when military circumstances were desperate. His speeches at the United Nations, meetings with world leaders, and media appearances effectively communicated the horror of ethnic cleansing and maintained pressure on Western governments to act. While this pressure never resulted in the robust military intervention he sought, it did contribute to the eventual NATO bombing campaign that forced Serb forces to negotiate.[^63]

Admirers within the Muslim world celebrate Izetbegović as a martyr-figure who endured imprisonment for his faith, led his people through an existential crisis, and demonstrated that Islamic values are compatible with democratic governance and European identity. Commemoration events marking anniversaries of his birth and death are held throughout the Muslim world, particularly in Turkey, where he is widely admired. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has frequently praised Izetbegović as a model Islamic leader and statesman.[^64]

### Negative Views

Critics, particularly among Serbian academics and politicians, characterize Izetbegović as a religious extremist whose Islamic fundamentalism made multi-ethnic coexistence impossible. They argue that the Islamic Declaration reveals his true intentions and that his wartime rhetoric and actions, including cooperation with mujahideen fighters and appeals to Islamic solidarity, demonstrate that he pursued a sectarian agenda disguised by democratic language. Serbian scholars often cite the declaration's statement about the incompatibility of Islam with non-Islamic institutions as proof of his fundamentalism.[^65]

Some Western academics and journalists have criticized Izetbegović for naiveté and strategic blunders that contributed to the war's outbreak and prolongation. Critics argue that his declaration of independence in spring 1992 without adequate preparation or international security guarantees was reckless and predictably led to catastrophic violence. They suggest that accepting one of the early peace proposals, such as the Vance-Owen Plan, might have prevented tens of thousands of deaths, even if it meant compromising on the ideal of a unified state.[^66]

International critics have highlighted the presence of mujahideen fighters and Izetbegović's acceptance of support from radical Islamic networks as deeply problematic. They argue that these foreign fighters committed atrocities, brought extremist ideology to Bosnia's traditionally moderate Muslim community, and some remained in Bosnia after the war, creating security concerns. The alleged visit by Osama bin Laden to Sarajevo during Izetbegović's presidency, if verified, would represent an association with terrorism that severely compromises his legacy.[^67]

Analysts critical of the Dayton Agreement argue that Izetbegović bears significant responsibility for accepting a peace settlement that institutionalized ethnic division and created an ungovernable state. They contend that his lack of flexibility during negotiations and insistence on unattainable goals resulted in a worse outcome than might have been achieved through more pragmatic diplomacy. The current dysfunction of Bosnia's political system is sometimes attributed to the compromises made at Dayton.[^68]

Some critics within Bosnia's secular and multi-ethnic community argue that Izetbegović's religious politics and the SDA's increasing identification with Bosniak nationalism rather than civic citizenship contributed to the ethnic polarization that persists decades after the war. They argue that true multi-ethnic democracy required secular political parties based on ideology rather than ethnicity, and that Izetbegović's leadership of an explicitly Muslim party undermined this possibility.[^69]

Human rights organizations have criticized the lack of accountability for crimes committed by forces under Izetbegović's command. While he was never indicted by the ICTY, critics argue this reflects political considerations rather than the absence of command responsibility for atrocities. They point to documented cases of abuses against Serb and Croat civilians in areas controlled by Bosniak forces as evidence that all sides, including Izetbegović's government, committed serious violations of international humanitarian law.[^70]
