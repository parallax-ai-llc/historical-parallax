## Summary

Altan Khan (1508-1582) was the leader of the Tümed Mongols and the de facto ruler of the Right Wing, or western tribes, of the Mongols during the 16th century.[^1] His name, meaning "Golden Khan" in Mongolian, reflected his status as a descendant of Genghis Khan through his grandfather Dayan Khan.[^2] He is primarily remembered for two major achievements: his military campaigns against Ming Dynasty China, including a dramatic siege of Beijing in 1550, and his pivotal role in converting Mongolia to Tibetan Buddhism.[^3] His 1578 meeting with Sonam Gyatso established the title "Dalai Lama" and transformed the religious landscape of Inner Asia for centuries to come.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Altan Khan was born on January 2, 1508, with the given name Anda, into one of the most prestigious lineages in Mongolian history.[^5] As the grandson of Dayan Khan (1464-1543), who himself was a descendant of Kublai Khan (1215-1294), Altan inherited a legacy deeply connected to the glory of the Mongol Empire.[^6] His father, Bars Bolud Jinong, was a notable figure within the Mongolian nobility and ruled significant territories as part of the Right Wing of the Mongols.[^7]

Born as the second son of Bars Bolud Jinong, Altan's position as a junior heir meant he was not initially expected to become the supreme leader of the Right Wing.[^8] His elder brother, Gün Bilig, inherited the prestigious position of Jinong and ruled the Ordos Mongols, while Altan received the Tümed subgroup of Mongols as his ulus (patrimonial territory), with pastures north of the border with Shanxi.[^9] This patrilineal structure underscored the Borjigin clan's reliance on genealogical prestige and the inheritance system established by Dayan Khan's unification efforts.[^10]

Altan was born into a world steeped in tribal alliances and wars, raised in the Tümed area, now part of Inner Mongolia, a region characterized by wide grasslands and a nomadic way of life.[^11] The harsh realities of the steppe shaped his early years, where survival depended on horsemanship, archery, and military prowess. While specific details about his formal education are limited in historical records, it is clear that Bars Bolud's household emphasized martial traditions inherited from Dayan Khan's unification campaigns against Oirat and eastern rivals.[^12]

Little is documented about Altan's mother or early siblings beyond his status as a junior heir, but the political environment of his youth was dominated by his grandfather Dayan Khan's attempts to reunify the fractured Mongolian nobility and regain the glory that had been lost since the fall of the Yuan Dynasty in 1368.[^13] This legacy of attempting to restore Mongol power would profoundly influence Altan's own ambitions and military campaigns throughout his life. The young prince grew up understanding that his lineage demanded greatness and that the path to prominence lay through military achievement and political cunning.

## Rise to Power

Altan Khan's rise to prominence was gradual but ultimately decisive. Initially ruling only the Tümed Mongols as his patrimonial territory, his opportunity for greater power came with the death of his elder brother Gün Bilig in 1542.[^14] Following this pivotal event, Altan became the de facto leader of the entire Right Wing of the Mongols and was bestowed with the prestigious title "Tösheetü Sechen Khan" (Wise and Sagacious Khan).[^15]

His consolidation of power was not merely a matter of inheritance but required careful political maneuvering. When Bodi Alagh Khan, the Khagan of the Mongols from the Chahar, died in 1547, Altan seized the opportunity to expand his influence.[^16] He forced Bodi Alagh's successor, Darayisung Küdeng Khan, to flee eastward, demonstrating his military superiority and political ambition.[^17] In 1551, Darayisung made a compromise with Altan, granting him the title "Gegeen Khan" (Holy Khan) in exchange for a cessation of hostilities.[^18]

By the 1540s, Altan had extended his control over territories from the Ordos to the eastern steppes, subduing the Ordos region that his brother had previously ruled.[^19] He managed to unite a tribal league between the Khalkha Mongols in the north and the Chahars to the south, creating a formidable confederation under his leadership.[^20] This unification gave him control over vast territories and numerous warriors, making him the most powerful Mongol leader of his generation.

However, Altan's rise was complicated by questions of legitimacy. Some historians note that he was "the most destructive of these usurpers" who sought to rule Mongolia despite not being directly descended from Genghis Khan's royal lineage in the traditional sense required for the position of Great Khan.[^21] This perceived illegitimacy would drive many of his subsequent actions, including his attempts to secure recognition from the Ming Dynasty and his later embrace of Buddhism, which provided an alternative source of spiritual and political legitimacy.

## Major Achievements

### Military Campaigns Against Ming China

Altan Khan's military achievements against the Ming Dynasty were legendary and struck fear into the hearts of Chinese officials. Beginning in 1529, 1530, and 1542, he launched raids into northern China, motivated both by retaliation for Ming trade restrictions and by the desperate need for livestock and agricultural produce for his people who suffered from famine and disease.[^22] Altan repeatedly requested trading privileges with China, offering to exchange horses for agricultural products and textiles, but the Ming court, suspicious of his intentions and facing opposition from scholar-officials, consistently rebuffed these requests.[^23]

The most spectacular of his military campaigns occurred in 1550, an event that would be remembered as one of the most audacious attacks on Beijing in the Ming Dynasty's history.[^24] Having once more been refused a request for trade, Altan led the Tümed Mongols in an invasion of the Xuan-Da region.[^25] Despite several attempts, he could not take the heavily fortified Xuanfu due to Weng Wanda's double fortified defensive line, and the garrison at Datong bribed him to avoid attacking there.[^26] Instead, Altan demonstrated his strategic brilliance by circling around Weng Wanda's wall to the relatively lightly defended Gubeikou, northeast of Beijing.[^27]

The Mongols arrived at Gubei Pass, 40 miles northeast of Beijing, on September 26, 1550, then moved on to Tongzhou where they camped for the night of September 30.[^28] On October 1, Altan's forces besieged the city of Beijing and looted the suburbs, leveraging their superior horsemanship and archery to terrorize the capital for approximately three days.[^29] According to contemporary sources, the raid resulted in more than 60,000 deaths and an additional 40,000 prisoners taken.[^30] During a 1542 campaign, Altan Khan reportedly captured around 200,000 prisoners and seized approximately 2 million head of cattle.[^31]

### Founding of Hohhot

One of Altan Khan's most enduring legacies was the founding of Köke Khota, meaning "Blue City" in Mongolian, now known as Hohhot, the present-day capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China.[^32] In 1557, Altan began building the Da Zhao Temple on the Tümed plain to demonstrate his leadership of the southern Mongol tribes to the Ming Dynasty government.[^33] The town that grew around this temple became known as the "Blue Town" (Kokegota in Mongolian).[^34]

Using captured Chinese deserters, Altan established a bureaucratic administration in the Chinese style at Kuku-khoto ("Blue City"), just beyond the Great Wall.[^35] This demonstrated his sophisticated understanding of statecraft and his ability to synthesize Mongol and Chinese administrative practices. The city became a crucial center for Mongol-Chinese trade and cultural exchange. In order to commemorate Altan Khan's great contribution to Hohhot, in September 2011, a seated statue of Altan Khan was completed in the square in front of the Dazhao Temple.[^36]

### The 1571 Peace Treaty

After being repeatedly defeated in military campaigns during the 1560s, Altan Khan negotiated a historic peace treaty with the Ming Dynasty in 1571.[^37] This treaty marked a turning point in Mongol-Chinese relations and established regulated trade and diplomatic relations that benefited both sides.[^38] The Longqing Emperor conferred upon Altan the title of "Shunyi Wang" (Obedient and Righteous Prince/King), and renamed his capital to Guihua, meaning "return to civilization."[^39] The treaty allowed Altan Khan to exchange horses for textiles and opened border cities for trade, alleviating the Mongol need to conduct raids.[^40] Altan swore allegiance to the Ming Dynasty and became a patron, receiving formal recognition that had eluded him for decades.[^41]

### Religious Transformation of Mongolia

Perhaps Altan Khan's most historically significant achievement was his role in converting Mongolia to Tibetan Buddhism, fundamentally reshaping the religious and cultural landscape of Inner Asia.[^42] Hearing of the reputation of Sonam Gyatso, a prominent lama of the Gelug school (Yellow Hat sect), Altan invited him to Mongolia.[^43] They met in 1577-1578 in an atmosphere of intense reverence and devotion, resulting in the re-establishment of strong Tibet-Mongolia relations after a gap of 200 years.[^44]

In 1578, Altan Khan designated Sonam Gyatso as "Dalai" (a translation into Mongolian of the name Gyatso, meaning "ocean"), creating the title "Dalai Lama" that has endured to the present day.[^45] The title was also posthumously given to Gendun Drup and Gendun Gyatso, who were considered Sonam Gyatso's previous incarnations, thus making Sonam Gyatso the 3rd Dalai Lama.[^46] In a brilliant political move, Sonam Gyatso identified himself as the incarnation of Drogön Chögyal Phagpa (who had been Kublai Khan's spiritual advisor), and Altan Khan as the incarnation of Kublai Khan himself, thus placing the Khan as heir to the Chinggisid lineage and securing his patronage.[^47]

Altan Khan and his followers quickly adopted Buddhism as their state religion, replacing the traditional shamanism that had been prohibited under the new regime.[^48] Mongol law was reformed to accord with Tibetan Buddhist law.[^49] Within 50 years, virtually all Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks who were members of the Gelug order, loyal to the Dalai Lama.[^50] Altan Khan had Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia's first monastery, built at the place of his meeting with Sonam Gyatso.[^51] A massive program of translating Tibetan (and Sanskrit) texts into Mongolian was commenced, with letters written in silver and gold and paid for by the Dalai Lama's Mongolian devotees.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Raids and Military Violence

Altan Khan's military campaigns against Ming China, while celebrated by some as demonstrations of Mongol power, were also marked by extraordinary violence and human suffering. His raids resulted in massive casualties among Chinese civilians, with contemporary sources reporting that the 1550 siege of Beijing alone took more than 60,000 lives and resulted in an additional 40,000 prisoners.[^53] During the 1542 campaign, Altan Khan reportedly captured around 200,000 prisoners and seized approximately 2 million head of cattle, devastating entire regions of northern China.[^54]

These raids were not purely defensive or retaliatory actions. While Altan Khan claimed he was forced to raid because the Ming refused to grant trading privileges, critics point out that the scale and brutality of his campaigns went far beyond what was necessary to obtain food and supplies for his people.[^55] The practice of taking tens of thousands of prisoners and millions of livestock represented systematic plundering that caused immense suffering to Chinese peasant communities who had no say in their government's trade policies.

### Legitimacy Questions

Historians have noted that Altan Khan's claim to supreme leadership of the Mongols was problematic from a traditional perspective. He was described as "the most destructive of these usurpers" who sought to rule Mongolia despite not being directly descended from Genghis Khan's royal lineage in the manner traditionally required for the position of Great Khan.[^56] While he was indeed a descendant of Genghis Khan through Dayan Khan and Kublai Khan, his specific lineage position made his claim to paramount authority questionable according to traditional Mongol succession practices.

This perceived illegitimacy may have driven his aggressive military posturing and his later embrace of Buddhism as an alternative source of legitimacy. Some scholars suggest that Altan Khan's actions contributed to Mongol political fragmentation that had long-term negative consequences, noting that "Ligdan's inability to consolidate the Mongols stemmed from divisions initiated during Altan Khan's rule."[^57]

### Suppression of Shamanism

Altan Khan's conversion to Buddhism and subsequent suppression of traditional Mongol shamanism remains controversial. After meeting the Third Dalai Lama in 1578, Altan adopted Buddhism as a state religion and enacted laws prohibiting shamanistic propaganda, rituals, and ceremonies, viewing black shamans' invocations of ancestral and lower-world spirits as antithetical to Buddhist doctrine.[^58] Sonam Gyatso's message, which Altan enforced, demanded that "there should be no more animal sacrifices, the images of the old gods were to be destroyed, there must be no taking of life, animal or human, military action must be given up and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished."[^59]

While these reforms eliminated certain brutal practices like widow immolation, they also represented a forced religious conversion imposed from above. Many shamanistic leaders felt marginalized by Altan Khan's reforms and sought ways to resist this religious shift.[^60] The suppression led to discontent among those who adhered to traditional beliefs, and the abrupt abandonment of ancestral religious practices caused social disruption. Critics argue that the conversion was partly motivated by political considerations—seeking legitimacy through Buddhism—rather than purely spiritual conviction.

### Political Opportunism

Some historians view Altan Khan's relationship with the Third Dalai Lama as a "quid pro quo" arrangement where both parties sought to benefit politically from their association.[^61] Altan Khan gained religious legitimacy and was identified as the reincarnation of Kublai Khan, while Sonam Gyatso received the title Dalai Lama and secured powerful political patronage for the Gelug school.[^62] This interpretation suggests that religious conviction may have been secondary to political calculation in the famous 1578 meeting.

## Personal Life

### Family Background and Marriages

Altan Khan's personal life reflected the complex marriage alliances typical of Mongol nobility. He was married to at least three wives, with his third wife, Queen Jönggen (1561-1612), being the most prominent figure in historical records.[^63] Mongol khans typically practiced polygamy to cement political alliances with various tribal groups, and Altan's marriages served both personal and political purposes.

Historical sources mention that during a family conflict in 1570, Altan Khan's wife (likely referring to one of his earlier wives) was afraid that Daičing Ejei, Altan's grandson, would be killed by the Chinese.[^64] This incident reveals the complex and sometimes dangerous dynamics within Altan Khan's extended family, where succession disputes and internal conflicts were common.

### Children and Descendants

Altan Khan had several children, with his son Sengge Düüreng being the most politically significant.[^65] After Altan's death in 1582, Sengge Düüreng succeeded to his father's title of Shunyi Prince with the support of the Ming court of China.[^66] Sengge Düüreng continued his father's policy of diligently supporting Buddhism, though he faced opposition from rival factions within the Mongol tribes, and his dependence on the Ming Dynasty for assistance ultimately weakened his position.[^67]

Altan Khan also had notable grandchildren who played important roles in Mongolian history. In 1570, his grandson Daičing Ejei Taiji defected to the Ming due to family strife, illustrating the internal tensions within Altan's family.[^68] Another grandson, Chürükhe, from Altan's first wife, ruled from 1586-1607 and notably became the third husband of Queen Jönggen, Altan's third wife, following Mongol succession customs.[^69]

The most remarkable family connection was the selection of Altan Khan's great-grandson, Yonten Gyatso, as the 4th Dalai Lama after Sonam Gyatso died in 1588.[^70] This extraordinary occurrence cemented the bond between the Mongol leadership and Tibetan Buddhism, creating an enduring connection between the two lineages that would shape both regions for centuries. The fact that a Mongol became the Dalai Lama demonstrated the profound transformation that Altan Khan had initiated in Tibetan-Mongolian relations.

### Personality and Character

While detailed personal accounts of Altan Khan's character are limited in historical records, his actions reveal a complex personality. He was clearly an ambitious military leader, capable of bold strategic thinking, as demonstrated by his successful circumvention of Ming defenses to reach Beijing in 1550.[^71] His ability to unite various Mongol tribes under his leadership suggests charisma and political skill.

At the same time, Altan showed pragmatism and adaptability. After decades of military conflict with the Ming, he was willing to negotiate peace when circumstances demanded it.[^72] His conversion to Buddhism in his later years (at age 70 when he met the Third Dalai Lama) suggests either genuine spiritual seeking or a sophisticated understanding that religious authority could provide the legitimacy that military conquest alone could not secure.[^73] The sincerity of his Buddhist conversion remains debated, but he actively supported the religion during his final years, building monasteries and promoting the translation of Buddhist texts.[^74]

## Legacy

### Religious and Cultural Transformation

Altan Khan's most enduring legacy is the religious transformation of Mongolia. His conversion to Buddhism and the establishment of the Dalai Lama title in 1578 fundamentally altered the spiritual landscape of Inner Asia.[^75] Within 50 years of his meeting with Sonam Gyatso, virtually all Mongols had become Buddhist, with tens of thousands of monks loyal to the Dalai Lama.[^76] The Tümed Mongols and their allies were brought into the Gelug tradition, which became the main spiritual orientation of the Mongols in the ensuing centuries.[^77]

This religious shift had profound political implications as well. It established a patron-priest model that influenced Inner Asian politics for centuries, creating an enduring bond between Mongolian leadership and Tibetan Buddhism.[^78] After Altan Khan converted to Tibetan Buddhism in the late 1500s, Genghis Khan was deified and given a central role in the Mongolian religious tradition, synthesizing Buddhist beliefs with veneration of the great conqueror.[^79]

### Architectural Legacy

The city of Hohhot, which Altan Khan founded as Köke Khota (Blue City), remains the capital of Inner Mongolia to this day, serving as a major political, economic, and cultural center with a population of millions.[^80] The Da Zhao Temple that he began building in 1557 still stands as one of the oldest and most important Buddhist structures in Inner Mongolia.[^81] Thegchen Chonkhor, Mongolia's first monastery, which he had built at the site of his meeting with the Third Dalai Lama, marked the beginning of a massive monastery-building movement across Mongolia.[^82]

In recognition of his contribution to Hohhot, a seated statue of Altan Khan was erected in September 2011 in the square in front of the Dazhao Temple, where modern Chinese and Mongolian tourists and pilgrims still visit to pay respects.[^83]

### Political Impact

Altan Khan's 1571 peace treaty with the Ming Dynasty established a framework for Mongol-Chinese relations that emphasized trade over raiding, benefiting both societies.[^84] The treaty's success in opening border cities for regulated commerce demonstrated that peaceful economic exchange could be more sustainable than military conquest. This diplomatic achievement influenced subsequent Mongol leaders' approaches to dealing with Chinese dynasties.

However, his legacy also includes political fragmentation. Some historians argue that the divisions he created in pursuing his own power undermined later attempts at Mongol unification, noting that "Ligdan's inability to consolidate the Mongols stemmed from divisions initiated during Altan Khan's rule."[^85]

### Impact on Ming Defense Strategy

Altan Khan's 1550 raid on Beijing had lasting consequences for Ming military policy. As a direct response to this attack, the focus of the Ming's northern defenses shifted from the Xuan-Da region to the Jizhou and Changping Defense Commands where the breach had occurred.[^86] Later in 1550, the dry-stone walls of the Jizhou-Changping area were replaced by stone and mortar, contributing to the construction of the Great Wall sections that tourists visit today.[^87] Thus, Altan Khan's military campaigns directly influenced the physical form of one of humanity's most famous architectural monuments.

### Historical Memory

American Orientalist Owen Lattimore wrote that while the Mongols were nominally vassals paying tribute after 1571, the Ming was also eager to please them, and the arrangement was more or less mutually beneficial.[^88] This balanced assessment reflects modern historical understanding of Altan Khan as a pragmatic leader who understood both the power of military force and the value of diplomatic negotiation.

Altan Khan is remembered differently by various groups: Mongolians often view him as a great leader who preserved Mongol identity while adapting to new political and religious realities; Tibetan Buddhists honor him as the patron who established the Dalai Lama institution; Chinese historians acknowledge him as a formidable adversary who eventually became a stabilizing force on the northern frontier; and Western scholars see him as a key figure in the religious and political transformation of Inner Asia during the 16th century.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who emphasize Altan Khan's religious contributions view him as a transformative figure who fundamentally reshaped Mongolian civilization. His establishment of the Dalai Lama title in 1578 is seen as one of the most significant religious innovations in Asian history, creating an institution that has endured for over 400 years and profoundly influenced Tibetan, Mongolian, and broader Buddhist culture.[^89] The conversion of Mongolia to Buddhism is credited with ending certain brutal practices, including ritual animal sacrifice, widow immolation, and excessive militarism, bringing the Mongols into closer alignment with broader Asian civilizations.[^90]

Supporters also highlight his political acumen and diplomatic skill. After decades of destructive warfare, Altan demonstrated the wisdom to negotiate the 1571 peace treaty with the Ming Dynasty, establishing a framework for mutually beneficial trade that brought prosperity to both Mongol and Chinese border regions.[^91] This transition from raiding to regulated commerce is seen as evidence of sophisticated statecraft and a genuine concern for his people's welfare.

The founding of Hohhot is celebrated as a major achievement in urban planning and administration. By establishing a city with Chinese-style bureaucratic administration while maintaining Mongol identity, Altan created a model for Mongol-Chinese cultural synthesis that allowed both traditions to coexist.[^92] His use of captured Chinese officials to establish effective governance demonstrated pragmatism and a willingness to adopt useful practices from other cultures.

Some historians praise Altan Khan for preserving Mongol autonomy during a period when Ming China was ascendant. By maintaining military credibility through his 1550 raid on Beijing while ultimately securing recognition and trading rights through negotiation, he ensured that the Mongols remained significant political actors rather than being completely subordinated to Chinese authority.[^93] His identification as the reincarnation of Kublai Khan through his relationship with the Third Dalai Lama also provided an alternative basis for legitimacy that was distinctly Mongol rather than dependent on Chinese recognition alone.[^94]

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize the extraordinary violence and human suffering caused by Altan Khan's military campaigns. The death toll from his raids—60,000 killed in the 1550 Beijing siege alone, 200,000 prisoners taken in 1542, and millions of livestock seized—represents catastrophic losses for Chinese peasant communities who had no responsibility for Ming trade policies.[^95] These critics argue that Altan's claim to be fighting for trading rights does not justify the scale of destruction he inflicted, which went far beyond what was necessary to feed his people.

Historians who question his legitimacy point out that he was described as one of "these usurpers" who sought to rule Mongolia despite not meeting traditional requirements for the position of Great Khan.[^96] His aggressive pursuit of titles—first the "Gegeen Khan" title from Darayisung, then the "Shunyi Wang" title from the Ming, and finally his identification as the reincarnation of Kublai Khan—suggests insecurity about his political position and a willingness to seek legitimacy from any available source, whether it be rival Mongol khans, Chinese emperors, or Tibetan lamas.

The suppression of traditional Mongol shamanism is viewed critically by scholars who emphasize religious freedom and cultural preservation. By prohibiting shamanistic practices and destroying images of traditional gods, Altan Khan imposed a foreign religion (Tibetan Buddhism) that, while originally from India, had been extensively adapted to Tibetan culture and was not indigenous to Mongolia.[^97] The fact that "many shamanistic leaders felt marginalized by Altan Khan's reforms and sought ways to resist this religious shift" suggests that the conversion was not entirely voluntary or welcomed by all Mongols.[^98]

Some historians view the relationship between Altan Khan and the Third Dalai Lama as a cynical political bargain rather than a genuine spiritual awakening. The mutual recognition—Altan as Kublai Khan reincarnated, Sonam Gyatso receiving the title Dalai Lama—appears suspiciously convenient for both parties' political ambitions.[^99] This interpretation suggests that Altan's Buddhist conversion at age 70, after a lifetime of warfare and violence, was more about securing legitimacy than genuine religious conviction.

Finally, critics note that Altan Khan's political legacy includes fragmentation rather than unification. While his grandfather Dayan Khan had worked to unite the Mongols, Altan's pursuit of his own power base created divisions that made subsequent unification efforts more difficult, contributing to the Mongols' inability to effectively resist the later Manchu conquest.[^100]

While specific quotes directly attributed to Altan Khan are scarce in historical records, the following represent statements and laws associated with his reign:

> "From that time on there should be no more animal sacrifices, the images of the old gods are to be destroyed, there must be no taking of life, animal or human." - Religious reforms instituted by Altan Khan following his meeting with the Third Dalai Lama[^118]

> "Military action must be pursued only with purpose and the immolation of women on the funeral pyres of their husbands must be abolished." - Social reforms implemented during Altan Khan's Buddhist conversion[^119]

> "These and many other such laws were set forth by Gyalwa Sonam Gyatso and were instituted by Altan Khan." - Historical record of the legal reforms following the 1578 meeting[^120]

The historical records note that Altan Khan designated Sonam Gyatso as "Dalai," meaning "ocean" in Mongolian, translating the Tibetan name Gyatso.[^121] This act of naming, while not a traditional quote, represents one of his most consequential statements, creating a title that has endured for over four centuries.

Altan Khan's correspondence with Ming officials regarding trade negotiations has been noted in historical sources, where he "requested trading privileges with China" and "proposed structured tribute and trade arrangements to replace sporadic raids, emphasizing annual submissions in return for regulated commerce."[^122] While the exact wording of these diplomatic communications has not been preserved in the sources available, they represent his pragmatic approach to Sino-Mongol relations.
