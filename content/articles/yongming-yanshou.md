## Summary

Yongming Yanshou was a Chinese Buddhist monk who is famous for synthesizing Chan (Zen) meditation with Pure Land devotion — a combination that became the dominant form of Chinese Buddhism. His 100-volume Zongjing Lu (Records of the Source Mirror) attempted to harmonize all Buddhist teachings. He argued that Chan and Pure Land were compatible paths, establishing a pattern that defined Chinese Buddhism for the next millennium.
