## Summary

The Roswell UFO incident is the seminal event in modern UFO history and arguably the most famous conspiracy theory of the 20th century. In early July 1947, a rancher discovered unidentified debris on his property near Roswell, New Mexico. On July 8, the Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) issued a shock press release announcing the recovery of a "flying disc," a statement that was quickly retracted and replaced with an explanation that the debris was a weather balloon.[^1]

For decades, the incident faded from public attention until the late 1970s, when new researcher interest and witness testimonies revived it. Proponents claim that an extraterrestrial spacecraft crashed and was recovered by the U.S. military, along with alien bodies, while the U.S. government maintains that the debris was from a top-secret Cold War project known as "Project Mogul."[^2] Today, Roswell is synonymous with UFOs, "Greys," and remains a touchstone for government secrecy and extraterrestrial folklore.

## Historical Background

### The Flying Saucer Craze (1947)

The summer of 1947 marked the birth of the modern UFO phenomenon. Just weeks before the Roswell incident, on June 24, pilot Kenneth Arnold reported seeing nine "supersonic" objects flying past Mount Rainier, Washington. His description of their movement—"like a saucer if you skip it across the water"—led to the press coining the term **"flying saucer."**[^3] This report triggered a nationwide wave of over 800 sightings, setting a context of high alertness and public fascination with unidentified aerial objects.

### The Atomic Age and Cold War Secrecy

Roswell was not just any small town; it was home to the **509th Composite Group**, the only nuclear-capable bomber group in the world at that time (the same unit that dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki). The environment was one of intense military secrecy as the Cold War began to heat up. The U.S. military was deeply concerned with Soviet nuclear capabilities and was conducting classified high-altitude balloon experiments to detect sound waves from Soviet atomic tests.[^4]

## The Incident: A Detailed Account

### The Discovery (Early July 1947)

W.W. "Mac" Brazel, a foreman at the J.B. Foster ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell, discovered a large field of debris scattered across the pasture following a severe thunderstorm throughout the night.

The debris field was extensive—claimed to be three-quarters of a mile long and several hundred feet wide. It consisted of rubber strips, tinfoil, tough paper, and sticks. Unlike ordinary materials, Brazel later claimed the "tinfoil" had unusual properties:

> "It was paper-thin, but you couldn't tear it. If you crumpled it up, it would unfold itself right back to its original shape." — _Descriptions attributed to Jesse Marcel_[^5]

### The Military Investigation

On July 6, Brazel drove to Roswell and showed some of the debris to Sheriff George Wilcox. Impressed and confused, Wilcox contacted the RAAF. Major **Jesse Marcel**, the base intelligence officer, and Counter-Intelligence Corps officer Sheridan Cavitt were dispatched to the ranch. They spent the next day collecting the material, filling their vehicles.

### The "Flying Disc" Press Release

On the morning of **July 8, 1947**, Colonel William Blanchard, commander of the 509th, ordered public information officer Lt. **Walter Haut** to issue a press release. It was a move that would echo through history:

> "The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disc..."[^6]

The story exploded across the wires. The _Roswell Daily Record_ ran the headline: **"RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch in Roswell Region"**.

### The Panic and Retraction

The press release caused a media firestorm that reached the Pentagon. That same afternoon, the debris was flown to Fort Worth Army Air Field. Brigadier General **Roger Ramey** took charge of the situation. He ordered the material displayed for the press in his office and identified it as a standard **rawin target** (a radar reflector used with weather balloons).

Photos were taken of Major Marcel crouching next to tinfoil and broken balsa wood sticks, looking visibly uncomfortable. Ramey stated the "flying disc" was a misunderstanding, and the story was effectively killed for the next 30 years.[^7]

## Witness Testimonies and The "Cover-up"

The Roswell story remained a footnote until 1978, when ufologist Stanton Friedman located Jesse Marcel. Marcel, now retired, told Friedman that the weather balloon explanation was a lie and that the material he recovered was "not of this world." This sparked a flood of new witness accounts.

### 1. Major Jesse Marcel (Intelligence Officer)

Marcel remained the most credible witness for proponents. He insisted until his death that the material commanded unique properties:

- **Weightless Metal:** He claimed a large piece of the metal felt like "nothing in your hand."
- **Indestructible:** He said they tried to dent it with a sledgehammer, but it wouldn't mark.
- **The Hieroglyphics:** Marcel described small I-beams (like balsa wood) that had pink or purple geometric symbols on them. His son, **Jesse Marcel Jr.**, who was 10 at the time, recalled his father waking him up in the middle of the night to show him the debris, specifically pointing out the "purple-hued hieroglyphics."[^8]

### 2. Glenn Dennis (The Mortician)

In 1989, Glenn Dennis, who worked at the Ballard Funeral Home in 1947, came forward with a sensational story. He claimed:

- **Child-sized Caskets:** He received multiple calls from the base mortuary officer asking about small, hermetically sealed caskets and how to preserve bodies exposed to the elements.
- **The Nurse's Confession:** He went to the base hospital and met a nurse friend (later identified pseudonymously as "Naomi Selff") who was in shock. She told him she had just assisted doctors in an autopsy of three "foreign bodies."
- **Description:** She drew a sketch on a napkin showing small, fragile beings with large heads and no earlobes. Dennis claimed she disappeared shortly after.[^9]

### 3. Lt. Walter Haut (The PR Officer)

Haut, who wrote the original press release, maintained the "weather balloon" line for decades. However, in a sealed affidavit released after his death in 2005, he changed his story completely:

- **The Craft:** He claimed Colonel Blanchard took him to "Building 84" (a hangar) where he saw an egg-shaped craft, about 12-15 feet long, with no windows or wings.
- **The Bodies:** He described seeing two small bodies under a canvas tarpaulin, with large heads.
- **The Plan:** He asserted the press release was a calculated distraction to divert attention from a second, more important crash site where the main craft was found.[^10]

## Official Explanations: Project Mogul

In response to a GAO inquiry in 1994, the Air Force released a massive report titled _The Roswell Report: Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert_. It declassified **Project Mogul**, offering a detailed counter-narrative to the alien theory.

### What was Project Mogul?

Mogul was a top-secret project designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests using long-range microphones suspended from high-altitude balloons.

- **The Debris Match:** The Mogul arrays were huge trains of balloons carrying radar targets. These targets were made of aluminum foil and balsa wood—matching the "tinfoil and sticks" description.
- **The Hieroglyphics:** The report explained the "purple symbols" on the sticks. The radar targets were manufactured by a toy company during WWII shortages. They used tape claimed to be "reinforcing tape" which had pink/purple flower and geometric designs printed on it (originally for gift wrapping or toy assembly).[^11]

### The "Alien Bodies" (1997 Report)

Addressing the bodies detailed by Dennis and Haut, the Air Force released a second report, _Case Closed_ (1997). It suggested "time compression" in witness memories, conflating 1947 events with:

- **Anthropomorphic Dummies:** High-altitude parachute tests (Project High Dive) in the 1950s used crash test dummies that looked like grey, hairless humanoids.
- **Accidents:** Fatal military accidents in the region (like the 1956 KC-97 crash) where burned bodies were recovered.[^12]

## The "Alien Autopsy" Hoax (1995)

The Roswell mythos reached fever pitch in 1995 with the release of the **"Alien Autopsy"** film by British entrepreneur Ray Santilli. The grainy black-and-white footage purportedly showed a medical examination of a Roswell alien.

- **Impact:** It was broadcast on Fox to millions of viewers, solidifying the image of the "Roswell Grey" in pop culture.
- **The Truth:** Decades later, changing his story, Santilli admitted the film was a "reconstruction" using animal organs (sheep brains, chicken entrails) and rubber models, filmed in a London apartment. He still claimed it was based on "real footage" he had seen but which had degraded, though no proof of the original exists.[^13]
