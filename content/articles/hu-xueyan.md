## Summary

Hu Xueyan was one of the most successful merchants in Qing Dynasty China, known as 'the Red Top Businessman' for his official titles. He founded China's first modern bank (the Fukang Bank), ran a vast silk trading network, and established the famous Hu Qing Yu Tang pharmacy that still operates today. His close relationship with powerful official Zuo Zongtang gave him enormous influence. His spectacular fall from grace after a silk trading disaster serves as a cautionary tale in Chinese business history.
