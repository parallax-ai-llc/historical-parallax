## Summary

George Orwell (1903-1950), born Eric Arthur Blair, was a British novelist, essayist, and journalist best known for the allegorical novella *Animal Farm* (1945) and the dystopian novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four* (1949). A democratic socialist who fought against fascism in the Spanish Civil War and witnessed Stalinist betrayal, Orwell devoted his writing to exposing totalitarianism, political deception, and the corruption of language. His concepts—Big Brother, thoughtcrime, doublethink, Newspeak—have entered common vocabulary as warnings against authoritarianism. Orwell's clear, direct prose style, his moral clarity, and his willingness to criticize his own side made him one of the 20th century's most influential writers.
