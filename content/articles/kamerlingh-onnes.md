## Summary

Heike Kamerlingh Onnes discovered superconductivity in 1911 when he observed that the electrical resistance of mercury dropped to zero at 4.2 Kelvin. He was the first to liquefy helium in 1908, opening the field of cryogenics. He received the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics for his low-temperature research.
