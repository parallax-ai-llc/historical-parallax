## Summary

At 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963, shots rang out in Dealey Plaza, Dallas, and the 35th President of the United States slumped forward in his motorcade. John F. Kennedy was dead within the hour. It was the crime of the century—and 60 years later, it remains one of history's most debated mysteries. The official conclusion: Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. The persistent question: Did he?[^1]

Within two days, Oswald himself was dead, shot on live television by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. The Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon Johnson, concluded in 1964 that Oswald was a lone gunman. But the questions never stopped. Witnesses reported shots from the "grassy knoll." The 1979 House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded there was "probably" a conspiracy. And polling consistently shows that most Americans don't believe the official story.[^2]

The theories multiply like echoes: the CIA, the Mafia, Castro, anti-Castro Cubans, the military-industrial complex, even Lyndon Johnson himself. Some are plausible; many are not. What remains certain is that a young president's death in broad daylight, followed by his accused killer's murder 48 hours later, shattered America's innocence and created a wound in the national psyche that has never fully healed.[^3]

**1:00 p.m.:**
- Kennedy pronounced dead

**The Zapruder film:**
- Abraham Zapruder captured the assassination on 8mm film
- 26 seconds of horror
- Most analyzed home movie in history[^4]

### Lee Harvey Oswald

**The accused:**
- 24-year-old former Marine
- Defected to Soviet Union (1959-1962)
- Returned to US with Russian wife Marina
- Marxist sympathies
- Worked at Texas School Book Depository

**After the shooting:**

- Never tried[^5]

### November 24: Oswald Killed

**Jack Ruby:**
- Dallas nightclub owner

## Official Investigations

### The Warren Commission (1963-1964)

**Established by LBJ:**
- Chief Justice Earl Warren (chair)
- Future President Gerald Ford
- Allen Dulles (former CIA Director)
- 7 members total

**Conclusions (September 1964):**
- Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone
- Three shots fired from Texas School Book Depository
- No conspiracy, foreign or domestic
- Jack Ruby also acted alone

**The "magic bullet" theory:**
- Single bullet caused 7 wounds in Kennedy and Connally
- Critics called it impossible
- Defenders: Aligned with victims' actual positions

**Report: 888 pages; 26 volumes of supporting documents.**[^7]

### House Select Committee on Assassinations (1976-1979)

**Reopened investigation:**
- Analyzed acoustic evidence
- New forensic tests

**Conclusions (1979):**
- Oswald fired 3 shots, killed Kennedy
- **BUT: "Kennedy was probably assassinated as a result of a conspiracy"**
- Found "high probability" of second shooter (grassy knoll)
- Could not identify conspirators

**Later:**
- Acoustic evidence discredited (1982, 2001)
- FBI, Justice Department rejected second-shooter conclusion
- But the doubt had been officially planted[^8]

---

## The Conspiracy Theories

### The Grassy Knoll

**The theory:**
- Witnesses heard shots from grassy knoll (ahead of motorcade)
- Some saw smoke, figures
- Kennedy's head movement (backward) suggested front shot

**The evidence:**
- Warren said shots from behind only
- HSCA's acoustic evidence (now disputed)
- No physical evidence of second shooter ever found

**Status:** Persistent but unproven[^9]

### CIA Involvement

**The theory:**
- Kennedy threatened to "splinter CIA into a thousand pieces"
- Conflict over Cuba (Bay of Pigs, Cuban Missile Crisis)
- CIA wanted regime change; Kennedy resisted
- Allen Dulles (fired by JFK) was on Warren Commission

**The evidence:**
- Circumstantial at best
- CIA has released documents showing no involvement
- But: Many records were destroyed or remain classified

**Status:** Popular theory; no hard evidence[^10]

### Mafia Connection

**The theory:**
- Kennedy's father had mob ties
- Robert Kennedy (Attorney General) prosecuted mob aggressively
- Jack Ruby had organized crime connections
- Mob wanted Kennedys stopped

**The evidence:**
- Ruby's mob associations documented
- Some mob figures made threats
- HSCA found "credible associations"

**Status:** Plausible motive; no definitive proof[^11]

### Cuban Connections

**Anti-Castro Cubans:**
- Kennedy "betrayed" them at Bay of Pigs
- Exile community furious
- Some possibly worked with intelligence agencies

**Pro-Castro/Cuba:**
- Oswald's pro-Cuba activities
- Visited Cuban/Soviet embassies in Mexico City (September 1963)
- Castro? Retaliation for CIA attempts on his life?

**Status:** Multiple theories; none confirmed[^12]

### LBJ Conspiracy

**The theory:**
- Johnson benefited most (became president)
- Texas was his territory
- Various allegations over decades

**The evidence:**
- No credible evidence
- Johnson pushed for Warren Commission (critics: to cover up?)
- Former aides, historians dismiss this theory

**Status:** Marginal theory; not supported[^13]

## The Enduring Mystery

### What We Know

**Firmly established:**
- Kennedy was shot in Dealey Plaza
- Oswald was in the building
- Oswald's rifle found; his palm print on it
- Oswald killed Officer Tippit
- Ruby killed Oswald

### What Remains Disputed

**Still debated:**
- Number of shooters?
- Oswald's connections (Cuba, intelligence)?
- Ruby's motives?
- Why Oswald did it (if he did)?
- Was there a cover-up?

### Why It Persists

**Structural reasons:**
- Oswald's death prevented trial
- Incomplete investigation
- Too many coincidences
- Powerful institutions had motives
- Documents still classified

**Psychological reasons:**
- Hard to accept: Great man killed by nobody
- Conspiracy feels proportionate to tragedy
- Distrust of government (grew after Vietnam, Watergate)

**As one historian said:** "If you can't find the conspiracy, that proves how deep it goes."[^14]

## Recent Developments

### Declassification

**JFK Records Act (1992):**
- Required release of assassination records
- Thousands of documents released
- Some still withheld for "national security"

**2017-2023:**
- Trump, Biden ordered more releases
- Nothing game-changing has emerged
- But: Continued withholding fuels suspicion

### 2023: 60th Anniversary

**Status:**
- Most historians accept Oswald as lone gunman
- But majority of Americans still believe conspiracy
- The case officially remains solved (Oswald)
- But culturally, it remains America's great unsolved mystery[^15]

---

## Legacy

### For America

- End of innocence
- Birth of conspiracy culture
- Permanent suspicion of government
- "Where were you when Kennedy was shot?"

### For Truth

- Shows limits of official conclusions
- Demonstrates how doubt can never be fully dispelled
- Model for all subsequent conspiracy theories (9/11, etc.)

### The Question

**Abraham Lincoln's assassin was caught and hanged. We know what happened. With JFK, 60 years later, we argue about what we saw on camera.**

**That's the mystery.**[^16]
