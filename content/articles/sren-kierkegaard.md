## Summary

Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855) was a Danish philosopher, theologian, and cultural critic widely considered the father of existentialism.[^1] His emphasis on individual existence, subjective truth, passionate inwardness, and authentic faith profoundly influenced 20th-century philosophy, theology, and Western thought. Through a revolutionary method of indirect communication employing pseudonyms, irony, and paradox, Kierkegaard challenged the rationalist philosophy of Hegel and the complacency of Danish Christendom.[^2] His voluminous writings explored anxiety, despair, faith, and the meaning of authentic human existence, establishing concepts that would shape existentialism, phenomenology, and modern theology for generations to come.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Søren Kierkegaard was born on May 5, 1813, in Copenhagen, Denmark, as the youngest of seven children in an affluent family.[^4] His father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard (1756-1838), had risen from humble origins as a shepherd boy on the Jutland heath to become a wealthy hosier in Copenhagen through astute business acumen and a fortunate inheritance.[^5] His mother, Ane Sørensdatter Lund Kierkegaard (1768-1834), had served as a maid in the household before Michael impregnated her and married her within a year of his first wife's death—a circumstance that would haunt the family with profound guilt.[^6]

Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard's stern piety, deep melancholy, and crushing sense of guilt shaped Søren's entire worldview.[^7] The father was haunted by a childhood memory of having cursed God while suffering alone on the heath as an eleven-year-old shepherd boy, and he believed this "unpardonable sin" had brought divine punishment upon his family.[^8] This belief seemed confirmed by a series of devastating deaths: five of Michael's seven children died before he did, along with his wife Ane.[^9] By the time Søren turned twenty-one, his mother and three siblings had died within a span of less than three years, reinforcing the family's belief in a hereditary curse.[^10]

Michael's domineering presence stimulated young Søren's imaginative and intellectual gifts but made a normal childhood impossible.[^11] Kierkegaard later described his childhood as "a paradise already lost in infancy," recounting the "frightful torment" he endured under his father's oppressive religious melancholy.[^12] The father bequeathed to his surviving sons, Peter and Søren, not only considerable material wealth but also "supremely sharp intellect, a fathomless sense of guilt, and a relentless burden of melancholy."[^13]

Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue (Østre Borgerdyd Gymnasium) from 1821 to 1830, where he received a classical education.[^14] In 1830, he entered the University of Copenhagen to study theology, philosophy, and literature.[^15] His university years were marked by intellectual brilliance but also personal struggle, as he grappled with his inherited melancholy and questioned his faith. The period of Kierkegaard's life corresponded to Denmark's "Golden Age," covering roughly the first half of the nineteenth century, during which Copenhagen experienced remarkable cultural and intellectual flourishing.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

Kierkegaard's path to philosophical prominence was unconventional and marked by personal crises that paradoxically fueled his creative output. Two pivotal events in the early 1840s shaped his intellectual trajectory: the death of his father and the broken engagement to Regine Olsen.

Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard died in 1838 at age eighty-two, an event that profoundly affected Søren.[^17] The inheritance of approximately 31,000 rigsdaler provided Kierkegaard with sufficient wealth to pursue a life as an independent writer without needing conventional employment.[^18] His father's death also spurred him to complete his education; after a prolonged period of study, Kierkegaard defended his dissertation *On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates* on September 29, 1841, earning his Magister degree (equivalent to a doctorate in philosophy).[^19]

The dissertation, written in Danish rather than the traditional Latin (for which Kierkegaard successfully petitioned the king), examined Socratic irony through the perspectives of Xenophon, Aristophanes, and Plato.[^20] While the examination committee acknowledged it as an intelligent and noteworthy work, they expressed concern about its "ambling, wordy, and idiosyncratic" style—a criticism that would characterize much of Kierkegaard's subsequent writing.[^21]

In May 1837, Kierkegaard met Regine Olsen, then fifteen years old, at the home of Mrs. Catrine Rørdam.[^22] He was immediately smitten, later writing that she made "a very strong impression" upon him.[^23] After a three-year courtship, he abruptly proposed to her in the summer of 1840; though initially showing him the door, Regine accepted two days later with her father's consent.[^24] However, Kierkegaard almost immediately recognized his mistake. Writing in his journal eight years later, he confessed: "inwardly – the next day I saw that I had made a blunder."[^25]

The engagement lasted only one year, from September 1840 to October 1841. In August 1841, Kierkegaard returned his engagement ring along with a carefully crafted break-up letter that would later appear "word-for-word" in his 1845 work *Stages on Life's Way*.[^26] He referred to the ensuing months as "the time of terrors," during which he fought to disentangle himself from the relationship.[^27] Kierkegaard broke the engagement because he realized his aloof, melancholic disposition made him unfit to be a good husband; additionally, his inheritance was sufficient to support himself alone but not a wife and children.[^28] Regine was devastated, as was her family, but she later married Johan Frederik Schlegel, who had been her tutor.[^29]

Regine's presence haunted Kierkegaard's work throughout his career.[^30] With the exception of a single work dedicated to his theology professor Poul Martin Møller, Kierkegaard dedicated all his writings to his father and to Regine.[^31] *Fear and Trembling* (1843) has frequently been interpreted as analogous to their relationship, with Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac mirroring Kierkegaard's renunciation of Regine.[^32] When Kierkegaard died in 1855, he bequeathed all his worldly goods to Regine, a final testament to his enduring feelings.[^33]

Following the broken engagement, Kierkegaard briefly fled to Berlin, where he attended lectures by the philosopher Friedrich Schelling.[^34] Upon his return to Copenhagen in 1843, he commenced an extraordinarily prolific period of literary activity that would establish his philosophical reputation. His first major work, *Either/Or*, published in February 1843, went through two printings and became Kierkegaard's only commercial success during his lifetime.[^35] The Danish writer Henriette Wulff wrote to Hans Christian Andersen that the work "attracted much attention" in Copenhagen literary circles.[^36]

## Major Achievements

Kierkegaard's philosophical achievements center on his voluminous authorship, his innovative method of indirect communication, and his development of concepts that would become foundational to existentialist thought. Between 1843 and 1846, he produced an astonishing body of work that included some of the most influential philosophical texts of the modern era.

**The Pseudonymous Authorship and Indirect Communication**

Kierkegaard developed a revolutionary literary method he called "indirect communication," designed to force readers into active engagement rather than passive acceptance of philosophical truths.[^37] Like Plato, who wrote dialogues without directly addressing readers, Kierkegaard employed multiple pseudonymous voices, each representing a distinct philosophical perspective and existential stage.[^38] His arsenal included irony, satire, parody, humor, polemic, prefaces, postscripts, interludes, and revocations—devices that deliberately obscured the author's intention and undermined authorial authority.[^39]

The pseudonymous works were published alongside a parallel series of "edifying discourses" written under Kierkegaard's own name, creating a dialectical tension between aesthetic-philosophical and religious-devotional perspectives.[^40] Major pseudonyms included Victor Eremita (editor of *Either/Or*), Johannes de Silentio (*Fear and Trembling*), Vigilius Haufniensis (*The Concept of Anxiety*), Constantin Constantius (*Repetition*), Johannes Climacus (*Philosophical Fragments* and *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*), and Anti-Climacus (*The Sickness Unto Death* and *Practice in Christianity*).[^41]

Johannes Climacus, described as a "self-described humorist," represented the subjective approach to knowledge while claiming that "subjectivity is truth," though Climacus himself was not a Christian believer.[^42] Anti-Climacus, conversely, wrote from such an ideally Christian perspective that Kierkegaard felt he lacked the authority to claim the views as his own; many scholars consider Anti-Climacus the "highest" Kierkegaardian voice, articulating views Kierkegaard endorsed but considered himself unworthy to pronounce.[^43]

**Major Philosophical Works**

*Either/Or* (1843), Kierkegaard's breakthrough work, presented a stark choice between aesthetic and ethical modes of existence through the writings of two fictional characters.[^44] In style "one of the most unusual philosophical tracts ever written," the massive two-volume work explored the aesthetic life of pleasure-seeking versus the ethical life of duty and commitment.[^45]

*Fear and Trembling* (1843), which Kierkegaard counted among "the most perfect books I have written," examined the biblical story of Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac.[^46] The work introduced the concept of the "teleological suspension of the ethical"—the idea that Abraham "overstepped the ethical entirely and possessed a higher telos outside of it, in relation to which he suspended the former."[^47] This led to Kierkegaard's concept of the "knight of faith," who exists in pure isolation, adhering by faith to an absurd telos that cannot be communicated or understood through rational ethical categories.[^48]

*Philosophical Fragments* (1844) and its massive sequel *Concluding Unscientific Postscript to Philosophical Fragments* (1846) constitute Kierkegaard's most direct attack on Hegelian philosophy.[^49] The *Postscript*, running to 623 pages in the Princeton edition—more than six times longer than the *Fragments*—is famous for the dictum "subjectivity is truth."[^50] Kierkegaard defined truth as "an objective uncertainty held fast in an appropriation-process of the most passionate inwardness"—the highest truth attainable for an existing individual.[^51] For Kierkegaard, "faith is the contradiction between the infinite passion of inwardness and objective uncertainty."[^52]

*The Concept of Anxiety* (1844) explored anxiety (angst, anguish, or dread) as central to the human condition and essential to understanding human freedom.[^53] Kierkegaard distinguished anxiety from fear: while fear concerns external threats, anxiety concerns what threatens from within one's own consciousness.[^54] He famously defined anxiety as "the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility."[^55] Anxiety represents both attraction to and repulsion from the nothingness of future possibilities, making it essential for creativity and self-creation.[^56]

*Stages on Life's Way* (1845) further developed Kierkegaard's theory of three existential stages: the aesthetic, ethical, and religious.[^57] The aesthetic life is lived for personal enjoyment and novel experiences of beauty and pleasure; the aesthetic individual has no solid framework for coherent choices because aesthetic pleasure is fleeting.[^58] The ethical life involves duty and service to others, with the individual becoming conscious of and responsible for good and evil.[^59] The religious life transcends self and others, with the individual "resting" their identity in the absolute.[^60] Importantly, Kierkegaard maintained that later stages do not replace earlier ones—all human life contains an aesthetic dimension—and there is no dialectical process of thinking that leads from one stage to another.[^61]

*The Sickness Unto Death* (1849), another work Kierkegaard considered among his most perfect, defined the real "sickness unto death" as not physical death but despair—a spiritual death stemming from not embracing one's self.[^62] Written by the pseudonym Anti-Climacus, the work argued that human beings are a "synthesis" of spiritual and physical elements, and despair results from misrelation between these elements.[^63] The solution to despair is faith—establishing a relationship with "the power that established it" (God).[^64]

**Key Philosophical Concepts**

Kierkegaard developed or elaborated numerous categories that became foundational to modern thought: anxiety, despair, melancholy, repetition, inwardness, irony, existential stages, inherited sin, teleological suspension of the ethical, Christian paradox, the absurd, reduplication, the universal and the exception, sacrifice, love as duty, seduction, the demonic, and indirect communication.[^65] His concept of "repetition" contrasted with recollection: while "recollection is confined to motionlessness and to the past," repetition "is in constant movement and is connected to the ethical future."[^66]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Kierkegaard's life and work generated significant controversy, both during his lifetime and in subsequent philosophical assessment. Three major controversies defined his public reception: the Corsair affair, his attack on the Danish Church, and scholarly debates about his philosophical method and conclusions.

**The Corsair Affair (1845-1855)**

The Corsair affair has been called "the most renowned controversy in Danish literary history."[^67] In December 1845, Peder Ludvig Møller published a frivolous review of *Stages on Life's Way* in his journal *Gæa*.[^68] Møller was secretly associated with *The Corsair* (*Corsaren*), a satirical publication notorious for gossip and caricature, while simultaneously seeking an academic chair at the university.[^69] On December 27, 1845, Kierkegaard retaliated in *The Fatherland* newspaper, exposing what some already suspected about Møller's connection to the disreputable journal.[^70]

Beginning in 1846, *The Corsair* embarked on a sustained campaign of public shaming and humiliation against Kierkegaard that would continue intermittently until his death in 1855.[^71] The magazine employed the novel device of satirical drawings to mock Kierkegaard's physical appearance, particularly his uneven trouser legs and thin frame.[^72] The campaign caused strangers to openly ridicule him in the streets and acquaintances to avoid his company.[^73] As a result, Kierkegaard became much maligned and derided by Copenhagen's citizens, including literary elites.[^74] The experience profoundly affected him, reinforcing his sense of isolation and his conviction that authentic Christianity required suffering and rejection by the world.

**Attack on Christendom (1854-1855)**

In the final two years of his life, Kierkegaard launched a fierce and controversial attack on the Danish state church and "Christendom" as a whole.[^75] The conflict began when Bishop J.P. Mynster, the primate of the Danish church and his late father's close friend, died in 1854.[^76] Mynster's successor, Hans Martensen, eulogized Mynster as a "witness to the truth," a characterization Kierkegaard found intolerable.[^77] Though Michael Kierkegaard had been Mynster's friend, Søren had long concluded that Mynster's conception of Christianity demanded too little of its adherents and betrayed authentic New Testament Christianity.[^78]

Kierkegaard waged his war through newspapers and through a self-published pamphlet called *Øjeblikket* (*The Moment* or *The Instant*), of which he wrote ten issues.[^79] Employing searing wit and satire without subtlety or nuance, he argued that the state-church union was unacceptable and perverted Christianity's true meaning.[^80] His main criticisms included: the state church and its clergy failed to live according to the New Testament, making public worship "a blasphemous insult to God"; congregational structure kept individuals as children, discouraging them from taking responsibility for their own relation to God.[^81]

The vehemence of Kierkegaard's attack shocked many contemporaries. Martensen later attributed Kierkegaard's assault to "fanatical imagination and personal hatred."[^82] Some viewed his critique as too harsh and even reckless.[^83] At Kierkegaard's funeral on November 18, 1855, his nephew Henrik Lund caused a disturbance by protesting Kierkegaard's burial by the official church, maintaining that Kierkegaard would never have approved, having broken from and denounced the institution.[^84]

**Scholarly Criticisms and Debates**

Kierkegaard's philosophical method attracted both admiration and criticism. His deliberately obscure style, use of pseudonyms, and rejection of systematic philosophy frustrated readers accustomed to clear philosophical argumentation. The examination committee for his dissertation noted concerns about his "ambling, wordy, and idiosyncratic" style, a criticism that would persist.[^85]

His commercial failure during his lifetime reflects the difficulty of his work. *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*, now considered one of his masterpieces, sold only fifty copies during his lifetime.[^86] Kierkegaard himself was confident that "history would offer him a warmer reception than his contemporaries did," recognizing that his work was ahead of its time.[^87]

Modern scholarship has challenged the traditional view of Kierkegaard as an absolute opponent of Hegel, suggesting that some of Kierkegaard's central ideas are creative developments of Hegelian concepts, and that his primary target was certain Danish Hegelians rather than Hegel himself.[^88] The first half of Albert Camus's *The Rebel* contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus considered existentialist philosophy in Kierkegaard's works, indicating critical engagement rather than simple acceptance.[^89]

Questions persist about Kierkegaard's treatment of Regine Olsen and whether his philosophical justifications for the broken engagement masked cruelty or psychological dysfunction. His inheritance was sufficient to support himself but not a family, yet whether financial considerations truly motivated his decision remains debated.[^90]

## Personal Life

Søren Kierkegaard never married and lived a largely solitary existence in Copenhagen, dedicated almost entirely to his philosophical and religious writings. His personal life was marked by inherited melancholy, physical frailty, intense introspection, and complex relationships with family members and his former fiancée.

**Family Relationships**

Only two of Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard's seven children survived him: Peter Christian Kierkegaard, seven years older than Søren, and Søren himself.[^91] Peter later became Bishop of Aalborg, following a more conventional religious path than his philosophically radical younger brother.[^92] The deaths of his mother Ane in 1834 and five siblings before his twenty-first birthday profoundly shaped Søren's worldview, reinforcing the family's belief in a divine curse.[^93]

Kierkegaard's relationship with his father was complex and defining. Michael's stern piety, crushing guilt, and melancholic temperament dominated the household and Søren's psychological development.[^94] The father's belief that he had committed an unpardonable sin by cursing God as a child, compounded by guilt over impregnating his maid servant and marrying her shortly after his first wife's death, created an atmosphere of religious terror and doom.[^95] Yet Michael also bequeathed to Søren considerable wealth and intellectual gifts, enabling his son's career as an independent writer.[^96]

**The Shadow of Regine Olsen**

No discussion of Kierkegaard's personal life can omit Regine Olsen, whose influence pervaded his work despite their broken engagement. After breaking the engagement in 1841, Kierkegaard never pursued another romantic relationship.[^97] In 1849, he sent Regine a letter expressing his sorrow and pleading for forgiveness, though by then she had married Johan Frederik Schlegel.[^98] When Kierkegaard died in 1855, he bequeathed all his worldly goods to Regine, demonstrating that his feelings for her endured despite—or perhaps because of—their separation.[^99]

With the exception of one work dedicated to his professor Poul Martin Møller, Kierkegaard dedicated all his writings to his father and to Regine.[^100] Many scholars interpret *Fear and Trembling* as a coded meditation on their relationship, with Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac serving as an analogy for Kierkegaard's renunciation of Regine in obedience to what he perceived as a higher calling.[^101]

**Personality and Daily Life**

Kierkegaard suffered from the same melancholy that afflicted his father, believing he had inherited his father's curse.[^102] He described himself as an "unhappy man" and famously wrote: "What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music."[^103]

Despite his melancholy, Kierkegaard maintained an active presence in Copenhagen society during his productive years. He was known for his daily walks through the city streets, during which he would engage passersby in conversation—a practice that became more painful after the Corsair affair turned him into an object of public ridicule.[^104] His physical appearance attracted attention and mockery: he was thin, with uneven trouser legs (one shorter than the other), which the Corsair's cartoonists mercilessly satirized.[^105]

Kierkegaard never held conventional employment, living entirely on the inheritance from his father—approximately 31,000 rigsdaler, a substantial sum that allowed him to dedicate himself fully to writing.[^106] He received little income from his publications, which sold poorly during his lifetime.[^107] His most commercially successful work, *Either/Or*, went through two printings, but most of his books attracted limited readership in Denmark's relatively small literary market.[^108]

**Final Days**

On September 28, 1855, Kierkegaard collapsed in the street, apparently suffering a paralytic stroke.[^109] He was admitted to Frederiks Hospital (or Frederiksberg Hospital) in Copenhagen a few days later, where he remained until his death on November 11, 1855, at age forty-two.[^110] The exact cause of death remains uncertain, though one theory suggests tuberculosis.[^111] His death occurred in the midst of his passionate public battle against the Danish state church, lending dramatic finality to his assault on "Christendom."[^112]

## Legacy

Søren Kierkegaard's influence on modern philosophy, theology, psychology, and literature has been profound and far-reaching, though it developed gradually and unevenly across different regions and disciplines. The lonely Danish philosopher who sold few books during his lifetime became, within a century of his death, one of the most influential thinkers of the modern era.

**The Rise of Kierkegaard's Reputation**

Kierkegaard's fame as a philosopher grew tremendously in the 1930s, largely because the ascendant existentialist movement pointed to him as a precursor and "father of existentialism."[^113] The Swedes were the first to recognize his importance, followed by the Germans and the French.[^114] Interestingly, Kierkegaard was translated into Japanese before English, and his influence is evident in later Japanese thinkers.[^115] By the 1920s he was influencing German scholarship; by the 1930s, French philosophy; and through translation into English in the 1940s, his influence became truly global.[^116]

**Existentialism and Philosophy**

For his emphasis on individual existence—particularly religious existence—as a constant process of becoming, and for his invocation of the associated concepts of authenticity, commitment, responsibility, anxiety, and dread, Kierkegaard is generally considered the father of existentialism.[^117] His philosophy has been a major influence in the development of 20th-century philosophy, especially existentialism and postmodernism.[^118]

Major existentialist and phenomenological thinkers acknowledged their debt to Kierkegaard. Ludwig Wittgenstein was "immensely influenced and humbled by Kierkegaard," claiming that "Kierkegaard is far too deep for me, anyhow."[^119] Martin Heidegger acknowledged Kierkegaard's masterly exploration of the human condition as one of anxiety (*Angst*), and Heidegger became the reluctant father of existentialism partly because he drew inspiration from Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.[^120] In 1935, Karl Jaspers, who stated he had been reading Kierkegaard since 1914, emphasized Kierkegaard's continuing importance for modern philosophy.[^121]

Jean-Paul Sartre, though developing existentialism in an atheistic direction contrary to Kierkegaard's Christian framework, built upon the notion that "existence precedes essence"—a concept rooted in Kierkegaard's thought.[^122] Other philosophers and theologians influenced by or engaged with Kierkegaard's Christian existentialism include Gabriel Marcel, Lev Shestov, Paul Tillich, Martin Buber, Franz Kafka, Emmanuel Levinas, and Jacques Derrida.[^123]

**Theology and Religious Thought**

Kierkegaard's impact on 20th-century Protestant theology was immense. Paul Tillich, an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, applied existentialist concepts to Christian theology and helped introduce existential theology to the general public.[^124] Other major theological contributors influenced by Kierkegaard include the German Protestant theologians Rudolf Bultmann, the French Roman Catholic theologian Gabriel Marcel, the Russian Orthodox philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, and the German Jewish philosopher Martin Buber.[^125]

Kierkegaard's critique of cultural Christianity and his insistence on authentic, individual faith rather than institutional conformity resonated with many 20th-century theologians seeking to revitalize Christian thought in an increasingly secular age. His concept of the "leap of faith" and emphasis on the paradoxical, absurd nature of Christian belief provided alternatives to rationalist theology and helped frame faith as existential commitment rather than intellectual assent.[^126]

**Psychology and the Human Sciences**

Many 20th-century psychologists and psychiatrists drew concepts from Kierkegaard, particularly the notions of anxiety, despair, and the importance of the individual.[^127] His psychological insights in *The Concept of Anxiety* and *The Sickness Unto Death* anticipated later developments in existential psychology and psychotherapy. His understanding of anxiety as distinct from fear, and as essentially related to freedom and possibility, influenced how subsequent thinkers conceptualized psychological distress.[^128]

**Literary and Cultural Influence**

Kierkegaard's influence extended beyond philosophy into literature, drama, and cultural criticism. His stylistic innovations—the use of pseudonyms, indirect communication, irony, and genre-mixing—influenced modernist and postmodernist literature.[^129] His focus on the question of what it means to be an existing, finite human being has had impact upon a remarkable diversity of figures across disciplines.[^130]

**Continuing Relevance**

Scholarship in recent decades has continued to explore Kierkegaard's relevance to contemporary issues. While earlier interpretations emphasized his opposition to Hegel, recent scholarship has challenged and complicated this view, suggesting that some of Kierkegaard's central ideas are creative developments of Hegelian concepts, and that his main target was certain Danish Hegelians rather than Hegel himself.[^131] This reassessment demonstrates that Kierkegaard's legacy remains contested and vital, continually reinterpreted by new generations of scholars.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders and admirers of Kierkegaard emphasize his revolutionary contribution to philosophy and his profound psychological and spiritual insights. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy notes that Kierkegaard "by the middle of the 20th century...exerted a substantial influence on philosophy, theology, and Western culture in general," establishing him as a major figure in intellectual history.[^132] His status as "the father of existentialism" reflects widespread recognition that he pioneered an entirely new approach to philosophy focused on individual existence, subjective truth, and authentic commitment.[^133]

Philosophers particularly value Kierkegaard's challenge to systematic rationalism and his insistence that important truths cannot be communicated directly but must be appropriated personally through existential engagement.[^134] His method of indirect communication is now recognized as a sophisticated philosophical strategy designed to respect readers' freedom and force them into active appropriation rather than passive reception of ideas.[^135] As one commentator notes, by removing himself as authoritative voice, Kierkegaard forced readers to engage actively with ideas, forming their own judgments—embodying his conviction that truth must be personally appropriated.[^136]

Kierkegaard's psychological acuity receives particular praise. His analyses of anxiety, despair, melancholy, and the stages of existence demonstrate profound understanding of human consciousness and the dynamics of selfhood.[^137] His distinction between anxiety and fear, and his recognition that anxiety is "freedom's possibility" and essential to creativity, anticipated later existential psychology.[^138] His definition of despair as a "sickness unto death" stemming from misrelation to oneself provided a framework for understanding spiritual and psychological suffering that remains influential.[^139]

Theologians celebrate Kierkegaard's recovery of authentic Christianity against cultural accommodation and institutional complacency. His attack on Christendom, while controversial, is seen by many as prophetic criticism defending genuine faith against its reduction to social convention and bourgeois respectability.[^140] His emphasis on the paradoxical nature of Christian belief, the necessity of the "leap of faith," and the individual's absolute relationship to God revitalized Christian thought in ways that remain relevant.[^141]

Karl Jaspers's 1935 statement that Kierkegaard (along with Nietzsche) retained "continuing importance for modern philosophy" has been repeatedly vindicated.[^142] Wittgenstein's humble acknowledgment that "Kierkegaard is far too deep for me" from one of the 20th century's greatest philosophers indicates the profundity others found in his work.[^143] The breadth of Kierkegaard's influence—spanning existentialism, phenomenology, theology, psychology, literary theory, and cultural criticism—testifies to the generative power of his thought.

Admirers also note Kierkegaard's literary artistry. His ability to create distinct pseudonymous voices, each with its own philosophical perspective and rhetorical style, demonstrates remarkable imaginative and intellectual range.[^144] His works are valued not only for philosophical content but as literary achievements combining philosophical rigor with psychological depth, dramatic flair, and stylistic innovation.

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptics have raised substantial objections to Kierkegaard's philosophy, methodology, and personal conduct. His deliberately obscure writing style, which admirers praise as sophisticated indirect communication, strikes critics as unnecessarily difficult, self-indulgent, and deliberately obfuscatory. The examination committee for his dissertation criticized its "ambling, wordy, and idiosyncratic" style, a judgment many subsequent readers have echoed.[^145] His commercial failure during his lifetime—*Concluding Unscientific Postscript* sold only fifty copies—suggests that even educated Danish readers found his work inaccessible or uncompelling.[^146]

The pseudonymous authorship, rather than a clever philosophical strategy, can appear as evasive refusal to take clear positions or accept responsibility for views expressed. Critics argue this allows Kierkegaard to advance radical claims while maintaining deniability, undermining philosophical discourse's requirement for clear argumentation and accountability. The multiplication of perspectives without clear authorial endorsement frustrates readers seeking definite positions on important questions.

Kierkegaard's anti-systematic stance and rejection of rational philosophy trouble critics who see these as intellectual abdication. His famous claim that "subjectivity is truth" can seem like dangerous relativism or irrationalism that abandons objective truth and rational inquiry.[^147] While defenders argue he meant truth must be subjectively appropriated through passionate commitment, critics contend this conflates truth's nature with its appropriation, potentially justifying any belief held with sufficient passion.

His attack on Hegel and Hegelian philosophy, once seen as a straightforward opposition, appears on closer examination potentially based on misunderstanding or deliberate misrepresentation. Recent scholarship suggests some of Kierkegaard's central ideas are actually creative developments of Hegelian concepts, and his primary targets were certain Danish Hegelians rather than Hegel himself.[^148] This raises questions about whether Kierkegaard's polemic was intellectually fair or based on adequate understanding of his target.

The vehemence of Kierkegaard's attack on the Danish Church in his final years strikes some as fanatical and unbalanced. Martensen attributed it to Kierkegaard's "fanatical imagination and personal hatred," a harsh but not wholly unreasonable assessment given the assault's intensity.[^149] Some view the attack as "too harsh, even reckless," especially given that it contributed to Kierkegaard's physical collapse and death.[^150] The question arises whether authentic Christianity truly required such absolute denunciation of imperfect but sincere fellow Christians.

Kierkegaard's treatment of Regine Olsen raises ethical questions that his philosophical rationalizations cannot fully answer. Breaking an engagement was his right, but the manner—the calculated breakup letter, the psychological manipulation, the lifelong refusal to leave her in peace—suggests cruelty or psychological dysfunction. His use of their relationship as philosophical material in *Fear and Trembling* and other works, turning private suffering into public allegory, seems exploitative. That he bequeathed everything to her in his will might indicate enduring love or persistent narcissistic need to remain central in her life even after death.

Albert Camus's extended rebuttal of Kierkegaardian existentialism in *The Rebel* exemplifies philosophical resistance to Kierkegaard's approach.[^151] Camus and other critics see in Kierkegaard's leap of faith an abandonment of reason that could justify irrationality and fanaticism. The "teleological suspension of the ethical" particularly troubles critics who see it as potentially excusing immoral actions performed in God's name—a dangerous doctrine in an age of religious violence.

Finally, Kierkegaard's resolute individualism and suspicion of community strike critics as promoting isolation and atomization rather than authentic human flourishing. His attack on "the crowd" and emphasis on the solitary individual before God neglects the essentially social nature of human existence and the legitimate role of community, tradition, and institutions in moral and spiritual life.

## Famous Quotes

> "Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom." — *The Concept of Anxiety*[^152]

Context: Kierkegaard explored anxiety as the fundamental human response to freedom and possibility, arguing that it emerges when consciousness confronts the infinite possibilities of choice and self-creation.

> "Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards."[^153]

Context: This paradoxical observation captures the temporal nature of human existence—we can only make sense of our lives retrospectively, yet we must make choices and commitments looking toward an uncertain future.

> "What is a poet? An unhappy man who hides deep anguish in his heart, but whose lips are so formed that when the sigh and cry pass through them, it sounds like lovely music."[^154]

Context: A deeply personal reflection on Kierkegaard's own melancholic nature and his transformation of suffering into philosophical and literary art.

> "Subjectivity is truth." — *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*[^155]

Context: Kierkegaard's famous dictum challenged the Hegelian emphasis on objective systematic knowledge, arguing that truth must be subjectively appropriated through passionate inward commitment rather than merely known objectively.

> "Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further." — *Fear and Trembling*[^156]

Context: Kierkegaard positioned faith as the ultimate human achievement, surpassing ethical life and requiring a passionate, paradoxical commitment that cannot be rationally justified or universally understood.
