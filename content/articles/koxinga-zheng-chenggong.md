## Summary

Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong, 鄭成功, 1624-1662) was a Southern Ming general, maritime commander, and the founder of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan. Born in Hirado, Japan to a Chinese merchant-pirate father and Japanese mother, he led armed resistance against the Manchu Qing conquest of China for over fifteen years.[^1] In 1662, he expelled the Dutch East India Company from Taiwan after a nine-month siege, establishing the first Chinese government on the island.[^2] His legacy remains politically contested, celebrated variously as a Ming loyalist, anti-colonial hero, Chinese nationalist symbol, and as a controversial colonizer who displaced indigenous peoples.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Zheng Chenggong was born on August 27, 1624, in Hirado, Japan, to Zheng Zhilong, a powerful Chinese merchant and pirate who controlled vast maritime trade networks, and Tagawa Matsu, a Japanese woman from a samurai family.[^4] Known by his Japanese name Fukumatsu until age seven, he spent his early childhood in Japan raised solely by his mother, as his father had left shortly after his birth to pursue commercial and military ventures in China.[^5] This bicultural heritage would profoundly shape his identity and later political symbolism.

In 1631, at age seven, Zheng was brought to Nan'an in Fujian province, China, though Japanese law prevented his mother from accompanying him initially.[^6] His father, recognizing his son's intellectual promise, engaged elite Confucian scholars to provide him with a classical education, hoping to legitimize the family's power through scholarly achievement.[^7] The young Zheng proved exceptionally gifted, passing county-level imperial examinations at age fifteen in 1639 and obtaining the shengyuan licentiate degree, qualifying him for the provincial scholarly elite.[^8]

By 1644, Zheng entered the Imperial Academy of Learning at Nanjing, studying under prominent scholars including Qian Qianyi, mastering classical texts, poetry, statecraft, and military strategy including Sun Tzu's The Art of War.[^9] His mother eventually joined him in Quanzhou in 1645, but their reunion was tragically brief.[^10] When Qing forces attacked the city in 1646 while Koxinga was away fighting, Tagawa Matsu refused to surrender and committed suicide, an event that profoundly shaped Koxinga's lifelong hatred of the Qing dynasty.[^11]

The young scholar's life took a dramatic turn when the Ming dynasty fell to Manchu invaders in 1644, transforming him from an aspiring civil servant into a military commander dedicated to restoring the fallen dynasty.[^12]

---

## Rise to Power

Koxinga's transformation from Confucian scholar to military leader accelerated after the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644. In 1645, he swore allegiance to the Longwu Emperor, one of several Ming pretenders who established a court in Fuzhou.[^13] The emperor showed exceptional favor to the young scholar, granting him the imperial surname Zhu and bestowing upon him the name Chenggong (成功, meaning "success").[^14] This act elevated Zheng from merely being the son of a maritime merchant to "a symbol of the Ming imperial clan," dramatically strengthening the legitimacy of resistance against the Qing dynasty.[^15]

The pivotal moment came in November 1646 when his father Zheng Zhilong, tempted by Qing offers of governorship over Fujian and Guangdong provinces, surrendered to the Manchus in Fuzhou.[^16] The 22-year-old Koxinga famously refused to follow his father's example, declaring: "Fathers should teach their sons loyalty, not disloyalty."[^17] This split between father and son became legendary—Zheng Zhilong's defection appeared opportunistic while Koxinga's continued loyalty to the Ming became the defining characteristic of his identity.[^18] The Qing eventually executed his father in 1661 after holding him in confinement for fifteen years.[^19]

By early 1647, Koxinga had fortified bases in Fujian and Zhejiang, launching raids that disrupted Qing supply lines and preserved Ming legitimacy in southern maritime theaters.[^20] By 1650, he was strong enough to establish himself as head of the Zheng family forces, and by 1655, the Yongli Emperor—the last surviving Ming claimant—conferred upon him the title Prince of Yanping (延平王) in recognition of his stern loyalty and numerous anti-Qing campaigns.[^21]

By 1655, Koxinga's fleet had expanded to approximately 2,300 ships supporting an army of 250,000 well-equipped soldiers, enabling sustained operations against Qing forces through raids and blockades.[^22] He commanded a formidable naval force that controlled large portions of the southeastern coastline, imposing trade blockades and collecting tribute from merchants seeking safe passage through the Taiwan Strait.[^23] His maritime empire constituted a complex network comparable to those of European powers, making him one of the most powerful independent military commanders in East Asia.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### The Failed Nanjing Campaign (1659)

In 1659, Koxinga launched his most ambitious military operation: a 100,000-strong amphibious assault up the Yangtze River toward Nanjing, the former Ming capital.[^25] The campaign initially showed tremendous promise. His forces decimated Qing defenses at Guazhou by cutting their riverine "Iron Dragon" chains, crushed elite Banner cavalry at Zhenjiang's Silver Mountain through combined arms tactics, and captured over forty cannons from demolished Manchu fortifications.[^26]

However, the campaign ultimately failed due to critical tactical errors. Koxinga fatally hesitated at Nanjing's gates for weeks, announcing his planned final assault ahead of time because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father had successfully achieved against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay.[^27] This gave the Qing ample time to bring in reinforcements. Weather complications further hampered the operation when wind changes made upstream sailing impossible, forcing troops to haul ships along the riverbank for two weeks.[^28] Manchu agents infiltrated Zheng's army and caused a major explosion, and taking advantage of the confusion, Qing forces launched a full counterattack that forced Koxinga's retreat, costing 5,000 lives and marking the end of realistic Ming restoration hopes on the mainland.[^29]

### The Conquest of Taiwan (1661-1662)

After his defeat at Nanjing, Koxinga turned his attention to Taiwan, then under control of the Dutch East India Company. On March 23, 1661, his fleet set sail from Kinmen with hundreds of junks carrying approximately 25,000 soldiers and sailors.[^30] On April 30, 1661, Koxinga's forces landed at Luerhmen, greatly outnumbering the approximately 2,000 Dutch personnel on the island.[^31]

Koxinga demonstrated remarkable strategic brilliance by exploiting tidal patterns to navigate the treacherous Luermen channel, bypassing Dutch coastal guns.[^32] When three Dutch ships attacked the Chinese junks, their main warship, the Hector, exploded due to a cannon firing near its gunpowder supply, crippling Dutch naval resistance.[^33] The military endeavor involved an arduous nine-month siege of Fort Zeelandia, during which Koxinga employed a shrewd combination of naval blockade, strategic land assaults, and relentless psychological warfare to wear down the Dutch defenders.[^34]

Dutch Governor Frederick Coyett, stationed in Fort Zeelandia with 1,733 people including 905 soldiers and officers, held out for nine months.[^35] With supplies dwindling and no reinforcements arriving, Coyett finally raised the white flag and negotiated surrender terms on February 1, 1662.[^36] Under generous capitulation terms, Koxinga allowed the Dutch to take their personal belongings and provided provisions for them to reach the nearest Dutch settlement.[^37] This marked the first time China had defeated a Western power using cannons and ships, and Koxinga showed remarkable magnanimity to his vanquished foe—a generosity that Coyett's descendants remembered for generations.[^38]

### Founding the Kingdom of Tungning

Following the Dutch expulsion, Koxinga established the Kingdom of Tungning (1661-1683), the first Chinese government in Taiwan.[^39] He instituted a Ming-style administration modeled on the Six Ministries: civil service, revenue, rites, war, punishment, and public works.[^40] Great care was taken in symbolism to appeal to Ming legitimacy—for example, using the term "guan" instead of "bu" to name departments, since the latter was reserved for the central government, demonstrating that Koxinga viewed Taiwan as a regional extension of the legitimate Ming dynasty rather than an independent state.[^41]

Koxinga imported numerous Chinese agricultural techniques to Taiwan, including the use of iron tools and cattle farming, which substantially improved the island's agrarian basis.[^42] He established a land tenure system and taught people to build reservoirs for irrigation, with rice as the main crop.[^43] His soldiers were required to clear land and farm when not engaged in warfare, and by 1666, grain harvests were sufficient to keep soldiers and civilians well-nourished while sugarcane plantations proved profitable.[^44] By 1684, areas under cultivation had reached 43,699.7 hectares, more than triple the 12,500 hectares at the end of the Dutch era in 1660.[^45]

Taiwan's maritime trade also flourished, becoming a prominent regional base for commerce with Japan, the Philippines, and other parts of East Asia.[^46] The Zheng merchant fleets held monopolies on commodities such as sugarcane and deer skin, which sold at high prices in Japan, while private traders paid tributary taxes for safe passage through the Taiwan Strait.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Treatment of Indigenous Peoples

Koxinga's legacy is deeply controversial regarding his treatment of Taiwan's indigenous populations. Recent scholarship has compared him to Christopher Columbus, noting his role in initiating indigenous land dispossession and genocidal violence in Southern Taiwan, particularly against the Siraya people.[^48] Taiwan's presidential spokesperson Kolas Yotaka stated that Koxinga "killed and pillaged the local population," drawing direct parallels to Columbus's impact on indigenous peoples.[^49]

Koxinga redistributed land away from indigenous Taiwanese toward Ming loyalists, leading to significant social resistance from indigenous groups and periodic violent conflicts.[^50] Tensions arose as land was increasingly appropriated for agriculture, and indigenous communities faced displacement and cultural erosion as they were pushed into less fertile areas of the island.[^51] By 1684, when the Qing Dynasty displaced the Koxinga regime, Taiwan's Chinese population of about 100,000 nearly equaled the indigenous population, with extensive intermarriage occurring.[^52]

The controversy has affected official commemorations. President Tsai Ing-wen canceled the practice of government officials attending Koxinga ceremonies when she took office in 2016.[^53] The evolving titles of the annual state ritual reflected this tension: from "Koxinga Reclaiming Taiwan" to "Koxinga Opening Up Taiwan," and finally "Koxinga Arriving In Taiwan."[^54] Scholars argue that celebration of Koxinga's "multifacetedness" works to obscure the foundational role of indigenous dispossession in Taiwan's formation as a Han-dominated society.[^55]

### Strategic Failures

Koxinga's disastrous 1659 Nanjing campaign revealed significant limitations in his strategic judgment. His fatal hesitation at Nanjing's gates, his announcement of the final battle ahead of time, and his failure to capitalize on initial momentum demonstrated that his tactical brilliance did not always translate to sound strategic decision-making.[^56] The retreat cost 5,000 lives and effectively ended any realistic hope of Ming restoration on the mainland.[^57]

### Family Tragedies and Succession Crisis

Shortly before his death, Koxinga faced devastating family news that may have contributed to his decline. Some accounts suggest he died in a sudden fit of madness upon hearing of his father's execution by the Qing in 1661.[^58] His succession was also contested—following his death, Taiwan's leaders initially made his fifth son, Zheng Miao, the successor, but his eldest son Zheng Jing arrived from Xiamen in December 1662 with military support and defeated his political enemies to claim power.[^59]

---

## Personal Life

Koxinga's bicultural background profoundly shaped his personality and worldview. Born to a Japanese mother from a samurai family and a Chinese merchant-pirate father, he embodied a unique synthesis of Japanese discipline, Chinese Confucian learning, and maritime warrior culture.[^60] His mother's influence during his first seven years left a lasting impact on his character, and her tragic suicide when Qing forces attacked in 1646 became a defining trauma that intensified his hatred of the Manchu regime.[^61]

Contemporary accounts describe Koxinga as possessing a complex personality—disciplined from his Confucian education, yet capable of dramatic emotional displays. Historical records describe his ritual burning of scholar's robes at the Nan'an Confucian Temple, where he vowed: "Once I was a student, now I am a subject without a sovereign. I respectfully return my Confucian garments."[^62] This theatrical gesture marked his complete transformation from scholar to warrior.

Koxinga had multiple children, though specific information about his wives remains limited in historical records.[^63] His son Zheng Jing succeeded him as Prince of Yanping and ruled the Kingdom of Tungning from 1662 to 1681.[^64] Following the Qing conquest of Tungning in 1683, his grandson Zheng Keshuang, the kingdom's last ruler, was taken to Beijing.[^65] Koxinga's descendants continue to live in both mainland China and Taiwan, while his brother's descendants remain in Japan.[^66]

His distinctive approach to military leadership merged different traditions: sophisticated naval warfare techniques and extensive trade networks from his father, large-scale organization from Ming military practice, and an appreciation for disciplined infantry combat from his Japanese heritage.[^67] This synthesis proved devastatingly effective against both Qing forces and the Dutch.

## Legacy

Koxinga died of unspecified illness in June 1662, only a few months after defeating the Dutch in Taiwan, at the age of 37.[^68] Contemporary accounts named heat stroke and cold as causes, while modern historians suspect malaria, though some sources suggest the stress of hearing about his father's execution, or even poisoning.[^69] His sudden death left his Kingdom of Tungning to his heirs, who maintained it for another twenty-one years until the Qing conquest in 1683.[^70]

His legacy remains deeply contested and politically charged across East Asia. In the People's Republic of China, Koxinga is celebrated as a national hero for driving the imperialist Dutch from Taiwan and establishing ethnic Chinese rule over the island, honored as the "Conqueror of Taiwan, Great Rebel-Quelling General" who brought Taiwan within the Han Chinese sphere of influence.[^71] The Chinese Communist Party regime lionizes him as a nationalist figure who fought to free Taiwan from foreign imperialism and unified the island with China, using his legacy in United Front propaganda.[^72]

In Taiwan, perceptions are far more complex and contradictory. Under the Kuomintang dictatorship (1945-1987), Koxinga was celebrated as a great Chinese national hero whose story paralleled that of Chiang Kai-shek—a heroic figure who resisted conquest by a foreign force.[^73] However, with democratization and the Taiwanese nativization movement in the 1980s, many local Taiwanese sought to distance themselves from the Chinese ancestry that Koxinga's legacy implied.[^74] The Taiwan nativist and pro-independence spectrum views him more ambivalently: still revered by some as a hero, but viewed skeptically by others as an interloper from China whose state proved transitory and who initiated the colonization and displacement of indigenous peoples.[^75]

Japan treats Koxinga as a native son, emphasizing his maternal link to Japan.[^76] Contemporary Japanese scholarship regards him as a "legendary figure of the East Asian maritime era," highlighting his cultural hybridity and historical significance rather than political affiliation.[^77] During the Japanese occupation of Taiwan, this connection was emphasized in propaganda to legitimize Japanese control.[^78]

Western academia has historically marginalized Koxinga's victories, which some scholars attribute to Eurocentric prejudice that obscures military successes outside Europe—a bias aligned with Edward Said's theory of Orientalism.[^79]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars from multiple traditions have praised Koxinga's remarkable achievements. His ability to maintain an independent maritime regime for over fifteen years against the powerful Qing dynasty demonstrated extraordinary strategic brilliance and political acumen.[^80] Historical analysis increasingly recognizes his sophisticated naval tactics and strategic objectives, contrasting with early Western portrayals that overlooked these aspects.[^81]

His defeat of the Dutch East India Company at Fort Zeelandia marked the first time an Asian power had defeated a Western colonial enterprise using modern naval warfare, a significant milestone in global military history.[^82] His generous treatment of the defeated Dutch—allowing them to leave with their possessions and providing safe passage—demonstrated magnanimity rare in 17th-century warfare and stands in sharp contrast to European colonial brutality of the period.[^83]

Modern scholarship emphasizes Koxinga's multicultural aspects rather than conventional Chinese nationalist accounts. Since the 1990s, his story has been reinterpreted to highlight his bicultural Japanese-Chinese heritage and his role as an "East Asian hero" who transcended narrow national boundaries.[^84] His establishment of agricultural infrastructure, introduction of advanced farming techniques, and development of Taiwan's maritime trade networks laid foundations that proved crucial for the island's subsequent economic development.[^85]

Defenders also note that Koxinga's unwavering loyalty to the Ming dynasty, even after his father's betrayal, represented the highest Confucian ideals of righteousness and filial duty to legitimate authority.[^86] His transformation from promising scholar to military commander embodied classical Chinese ideals of the scholar-warrior who takes up arms when civilization faces existential threats.[^87]

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize Koxinga's role as a colonizer who initiated systematic displacement and violence against Taiwan's indigenous peoples. The comparison to Christopher Columbus highlights how Koxinga's legacy involves celebrating conquest and colonization while marginalizing indigenous suffering.[^88] His land redistribution policies favored Ming loyalist settlers at the expense of indigenous communities, establishing patterns of Han dominance and indigenous marginalization that persisted for centuries.[^89]

Scholars critical of Koxinga note that his Ming restoration efforts were ultimately futile and self-serving. After the disastrous Nanjing campaign, he turned to Taiwan not primarily for strategic reasons but because he needed a secure base to maintain his own power and commercial empire.[^90] His Taiwan regime proved transitory, lasting only twenty-two years before Qing conquest, raising questions about whether the suffering he inflicted on indigenous populations served any meaningful purpose.[^91]

Some historians view his father Zheng Zhilong's surrender to the Qing as pragmatic realism, while Koxinga's continued resistance appears as stubborn loyalty to a lost cause that cost thousands of lives.[^92] His announcement of the Nanjing assault ahead of time—seeking a dramatic, decisive battle for glory rather than pursuing effective military strategy—exemplifies how personal vanity may have compromised his judgment.[^93]

Western historians have sometimes portrayed Koxinga as little more than a pirate or warlord, emphasizing the Zheng family's origins in maritime trade and "piracy" and questioning the legitimacy of his claims to represent Ming restoration.[^94] Contemporary Qing sources depicted him as a rebel and traitor to the established order, though such characterizations served clear propaganda purposes.[^95]

Indigenous rights advocates argue that celebrating Koxinga perpetuates settler colonialism by centering Han Chinese narratives while erasing indigenous perspectives and experiences.[^96] The evolution of official commemorations—from "Koxinga Reclaiming Taiwan" to the more neutral "Koxinga Arriving in Taiwan"—reflects growing awareness that previous celebrations were inappropriate given his role in indigenous dispossession.[^97]
