## Summary

Averroes (Ibn Rushd) was an Andalusian Muslim philosopher, jurist, and physician who was the most important medieval commentator on Aristotle. His work profoundly influenced both Islamic and European philosophy, particularly through his defense of philosophy against al-Ghazali's critique in Tahafut al-Tahafut (The Incoherence of the Incoherence). He argued that philosophy and religion were compatible paths to truth. He also served as chief judge of Córdoba and Seville.
