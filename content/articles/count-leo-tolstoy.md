## Summary

Leo Tolstoy was a Russian novelist who became one of the most influential Christian thinkers of the modern era. After a spiritual crisis, he developed a radical interpretation of Christianity based on the Sermon on the Mount, rejecting violence, state authority, and institutional religion. His works The Kingdom of God Is Within You and A Confession profoundly influenced Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and pacifist movements worldwide. He was excommunicated by the Russian Orthodox Church.
