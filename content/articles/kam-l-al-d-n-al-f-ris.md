## Summary

Kamal al-Din al-Farisi was a Persian physicist who provided the first correct explanation of the rainbow through his experiments with a glass sphere filled with water. His work Tanqih al-Manazir (Revision of Optics) advanced Ibn al-Haytham's optics and explained both primary and secondary rainbows through refraction and reflection of light inside water droplets.
