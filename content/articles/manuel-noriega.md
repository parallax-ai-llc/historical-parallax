## Summary

Manuel Antonio Noriega Moreno (February 11, 1934 – May 29, 2017) was a Panamanian military officer and dictator who served as the de facto ruler of Panama from 1983 to 1989.[^1] A graduate of the U.S. Army School of the Americas and longtime CIA asset, Noriega rose through Panama's military intelligence ranks while simultaneously facilitating drug trafficking for the Medellín Cartel.[^2] His regime was marked by human rights abuses, political repression, and complex relationships with U.S. intelligence agencies that eventually collapsed when American forces invaded Panama in December 1989 to remove him from power.[^3] After his capture, Noriega was convicted of drug trafficking and money laundering in U.S. courts, later serving additional sentences in France and Panama before his death in 2017.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Manuel Antonio Noriega Moreno was born on February 11, 1934, in Panama City, though his exact birth date remains uncertain, having been variously recorded as 1934, 1936, and 1938.[^5] He was born into a relatively poor pardo family—of mixed Native Panamanian, African, and Spanish heritage—in the neighborhood of El Terraplen de San Felipe.[^6] His mother, whose family name was Moreno, was described as a cook and a laundress, while his father, Ricaurte Noriega, worked as an accountant.[^7] Tragically, his mother died of tuberculosis when Noriega was a child, and both of his parents were dead by the time he was five years old.[^8]

Raised by a godmother in a one-room apartment in the slum area of Terraplén, Noriega experienced the hardships of poverty firsthand.[^9] Despite his difficult circumstances, he pursued education with determination. He was educated first at the Escuela República de México, and later at the Instituto Nacional, a well-regarded high school in Panama City.[^10] Though he excelled in his studies, young Manuel was often bullied for his acne-pocked skin, with fellow students calling him "cara de piña" or "pineapple face"—a nickname he would detest throughout his life.[^11]

His academic achievements earned him a scholarship to the Chorrillos Military School in Lima, Peru, marking the beginning of his military career.[^12] In the 1960s, Noriega completed intelligence and counterintelligence training at the U.S. Army School of the Americas at Fort Gulick, Panama, in 1967, as well as courses in Jungle Operations (1965) and psychological operations at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.[^13] During this period, the CIA recruited Noriega as a paid informant in the 1950s, though the relationship did not become contractual until 1967.[^14] This early connection with U.S. intelligence agencies would profoundly shape his political trajectory and eventual downfall.

---

## Rise to Power

Noriega's ascent to power was inextricably linked to his alliance with General Omar Torrijos, who became his patron and mentor.[^15] Omar Torrijos was Manuel Noriega's commanding officer in Colón when Torrijos was a major in the National Guard, and Torrijos became Noriega's patron after rescuing him from criminal charges for rape in Panama in 1962, finding him to be a loyal and reliable enforcer.[^16] Torrijos's relationship with Noriega was symbiotic—Torrijos provided the political acumen, while Noriega enforced his unpopular decisions with force, when necessary.[^17]

The pivotal moment in Noriega's rise came during the 1968 coup when Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias.[^18] During this coup, Noriega's troops seized radio and telephone stations in the city of David, cutting off communications with Panama City.[^19] Just one month after the coup attempt, Noriega was promoted to captain; eighteen months later, in August 1970, Torrijos promoted him to the position of lieutenant colonel and appointed him chief of military intelligence (G-2).[^20]

A critical test of Noriega's loyalty came in December 1969 when a coup was launched against Torrijos in his absence.[^21] Noriega lined up cars along the runway with their lights on to help Torrijos land safely, and with Noriega's troops at his service, Torrijos reclaimed the capital.[^22] This loyalty greatly enhanced both men's positions. As head of the G-2 intelligence service, Noriega used brutal means to consolidate power, and tales of torture, murder, rape, and other crimes committed by Noriega's G-2 intelligence service quickly spread across Panama, intimidating any opposition to the regime.[^23]

Beginning in the 1950s, Noriega worked with U.S. intelligence agencies, and became one of the Central Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources.[^24] By the middle of the 1970s, the CIA was paying Noriega $110,000 per year for his cooperation.[^25] He served as a Cold War asset for the U.S. in its confrontation with Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nicaragua's Sandinistas, and other Caribbean communists.[^26]

When Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981, Noriega vied with other military and civilian leaders to gain the upper hand.[^27] In 1983, he succeeded to the command of the National Guard, unified the armed forces into the Panamanian Defense Forces (PDF), and promoted himself to the rank of general.[^28] By this point, Noriega had become Panama's de facto ruler, never officially serving as president but instead ruling as an unelected military dictator through puppet presidents.[^29]

## Major Achievements

Despite the overwhelming negative aspects of his rule, Noriega's regime did produce certain outcomes that some viewed as achievements, particularly in the context of Panamanian nationalism and infrastructure development.

### Intelligence Operations and Regional Influence

Noriega established Panama as a critical intelligence hub in Central America during the Cold War era. He provided information to U.S. officials on guerrilla activities, money laundering, and drug trafficking, while simultaneously allowing the U.S. to set up listening posts in Panama.[^30] He is believed to have served as a conduit for U.S. funds to Nicaraguan contra rebels fighting the leftist Sandinista government.[^31] In September 1986, Oliver North met with Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to negotiate assistance to Nicaragua, where Noriega offered to provide military training and weapons for the Contras and also to infiltrate Panamanian troops inside Nicaragua.[^32]

### Military Modernization

Noriega reformed the National Guard as the Panama Defense Forces (PDF), and with financial assistance from the U.S., expanded and modernized it.[^33] The PDF became a more professionalized and capable military organization than its predecessor, though it was primarily used for internal repression rather than external defense.

### Financial Sector Development

Under Noriega's rule, Panama became an increasingly important international financial center, though this development was deeply intertwined with money laundering operations. One of the large financial institutions that he was able to use to launder money was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI).[^34] While this brought considerable capital flow into Panama, it also established the country as a haven for illicit financial activities.

### Maintenance of Canal Zone Negotiations

Noriega maintained the trajectory established by Torrijos regarding the eventual transfer of the Panama Canal to Panamanian control. Though the handover was ultimately completed in 1999, after Noriega's removal, his regime did not reverse the agreements negotiated by his predecessor.

### Political Survival and Regional Balancing

For nearly a decade, Noriega successfully balanced competing interests from the United States, drug cartels, Latin American governments, and domestic opposition forces. His ability to maintain power while playing these various factions against each other demonstrated considerable political acumen, however morally compromised. CIA Director William Casey acknowledged this complexity when he put it bluntly: "He's a bastard, but he's our bastard."[^35]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Noriega's regime was characterized by systematic human rights abuses, corruption, and criminal enterprises that ultimately led to his international condemnation and removal from power.

### Drug Trafficking and Organized Crime

Despite his intelligence work for the U.S., Noriega was found to have been supplying information and assistance to drug cartels in the region while at the same time pledging to help the United States fight the so-called war on drugs in Panama.[^36] He struck a deal with Pablo Escobar's Medellín Cartel, allowing cocaine to pass through Tocumen airport in exchange for $1,000 per kilo that reached the United States.[^37] According to testimony from Noriega's personal pilot Floyd Carlton, Pablo Escobar and Gustave Gavira approached him about an arrangement which would allow Carlton to fly cocaine to Panama under the general's authority, and over the years, Carlton estimated that Noriega received $5 million in kickbacks.[^38]

A 1988 Senate Subcommittee concluded that "each U.S. government agency which had a relationship with Noriega turned a blind eye to his corruption and drug dealing, even as he was emerging as a key player on behalf of the Medellín Cartel."[^39] Noriega was later accused in a U.S. court of accepting up to $60 million in bribes from cartel members, who apparently also paid Panamanian banks 2 percent of proceeds to launder their drug money.[^40]

### Human Rights Violations

Noriega is alleged to have been responsible for extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, detention without trial, and the torture and ill-treatment of demonstrators while he was de facto ruler of Panama from 1983 to 1989.[^41] According to the Panama Truth Commission's findings, the military regime was involved in torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment of victims, with 148 cases of human rights abuse documented.[^42]

The most infamous case was the September 13, 1985, torture and decapitation murder of Hugo Spadafora, a prominent dissident and former deputy health minister whose mutilated body was dumped across the Costa Rican border.[^43] Spadafora's stomach was full of the blood he had ingested during the slow severing of his head, and his head was never found.[^44] The National Security Agency intercepted a phone call between Noriega and Maj. Luis Córdoba, where Córdoba called Noriega—in Paris—to say "We have the rabid dog," and Noriega responded: "And what does one do with a dog that has rabies?"[^45]

### Election Fraud and Political Repression

In 1984, a presidential election was held with the Noriega-backed candidate Nicolás Ardito Barletta running against opposition candidate Arnulfo Arias.[^46] It is now widely accepted that Arias won and that the dictatorship resorted to electoral fraud in order to anoint Barletta as winner, by just 1,713 votes.[^47] Counting of votes was stopped early and suspended on May 9th, with final results showing Barletta winning by 1,713 votes on May 16th.[^48]

The situation worsened in the 1989 elections when General elections were held on May 7, 1989, with Guillermo Endara heading the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition against pro-Noriega candidate Carlos Duque.[^49] Opposition counts showed Endara winning in a landslide with a nearly 3-to-1 lead over Duque, and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, present in Panama as an observer, denounced Noriega, saying the election had been "stolen."[^50] Rather than publish the results, Noriega voided the election, claiming that "foreign interference" had tainted the results.[^51] The next day, Endara and his running mate were badly beaten by a detachment of Dignity Battalions, a paramilitary group supporting Noriega.[^52]

### Complex U.S. Relationship

Noriega's relationship with the United States was deeply contradictory. George H.W. Bush first met Manuel Noriega when Bush became the CIA Director in the 1970s, flying to Panama to meet with Noriega and ultimately approving his paychecks.[^53] When Reagan won the White House in 1980, with Bush as his vice president, Bush made sure the CIA rehired the Panamanian.[^54] By the time Noriega became Panama's dictator in 1983, the Reagan-Bush administration was paying him $165,000 to $200,000 annually.[^55]

However, as Noriega's drug trafficking became more public and politically embarrassing, U.S. policy shifted. In 1988, Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa on charges of racketeering, drug smuggling, and money laundering.[^56] President Reagan ordered a freeze on all Panamanian government assets in the United States and imposed economic sanctions.[^57] Throughout 1988 the Reagan administration encouraged a PDF coup, offered Noriega deals in return for his resignation, imposed sanctions on Panama, authorized covert actions against him, and dispatched additional forces to the U.S. bases in Panama.[^58]

---

## Personal Life

Manuel Noriega married Felicidad Sieiro in the late 1960s.[^59] Sieiro had been a school teacher, and Noriega a member of the National Guard when they met. Her family, of Basque heritage, was reported to have been unhappy with the marriage.[^60] The marriage faced significant challenges, as Noriega was repeatedly unfaithful to his wife, who at one point expressed a desire for a divorce, though she changed her mind later.[^61]

The couple had three daughters: Lorena, Sandra, and Thays.[^62] Lorena Noriega was a law student in the Dominican Republic.[^63] Noriega's grandchildren included 2-year-old Jean Manuel Beauchamp and 1-year-old Jeanine Beauchamp, who were the children of his daughter Sandra Beauchamp.[^64] Despite the chaos of his public life, Noriega's wife Felicidad publicly defended him, telling reporters that he was a loving father and good husband.[^65]

Throughout his life, Noriega remained extremely sensitive about his physical appearance, particularly the acne scars that had earned him the derogatory nickname "cara de piña" (pineapple face).[^66] He was known to his fans as "El Man" and to his critics as "Pineapple Face" because of his acne scars.[^67] This sensitivity about his appearance manifested even decades later when Noriega claimed his reputation was tarnished by his depiction as "Old Pineapple Face" in the video game "Call of Duty: Black Ops II," leading to a lawsuit that was ultimately dismissed.[^68]

In an interview with Oliver Stone in 1993, Noriega revealed aspects of his self-image and worldview. He stated "I fight cleanly" when discussing whether he had damaging evidence against George H.W. Bush, and regarding President Bush and the U.S. invasion, Noriega said "I forgave him as a Christian."[^69] Remarkably, Noriega once told an American interviewer that he envisioned himself portrayed in the movies by Clint Eastwood because, "He is very macho."[^70]

## Legacy

The legacy of Manuel Noriega in Panama's political history is multifaceted, serving as both a cautionary tale about authoritarianism and a catalyst for democratic transformation.[^71]

### Democratic Transformation

Noriega's removal opened the door for political reform and the restructuring of Panama's military. In 1990, the newly elected democratic government disbanded the Panamanian Defense Forces, marking a critical step in Panama's transition to civilian-led governance.[^72] This abolition of the military as a political force represented one of the most significant institutional changes in Panamanian history. The invasion accelerated the removal of Manuel Noriega and facilitated the country's transition to democratic governance, though it also engendered lasting resentment and skepticism toward U.S. intervention.[^73]

### Sovereignty and Canal Zone

Noriega's absence changed Panama's national trajectory dramatically. Once democracy was restored, the United States recommitted to turning the canal over to Panama and returning full sovereignty over the Canal Zone by 2000.[^74] The peaceful transfer of the Panama Canal to Panamanian control on December 31, 1999, represented the fulfillment of nationalist aspirations that had motivated Panamanian politics for decades.

### Impact on U.S.-Latin American Relations

The U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989, while achieving its immediate objective of removing Noriega, raised profound questions about American interventionism in Latin America. The invasion and Noriega's removal raised questions about Panama's sovereignty, with many citizens questioning whether Panama could establish an independent political system free from foreign influence.[^75] The lessons of the Noriega era have instilled in Panamanian leaders a cautious approach to international alliances; as Panama navigates its role as a global financial and trade hub, the memory of Noriega's rule serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in allowing external powers to shape its political trajectory.[^76]

### Social and Psychological Wounds

The removal of Manuel Noriega led to political stability, but societal divisions persisted due to the invasion's trauma, with many Panamanians experiencing lasting psychological and communal wounds.[^77] The civilian casualties from Operation Just Cause—estimates vary widely from several hundred to several thousand—remain a source of controversy and pain in Panamanian society.

### Lessons on Corruption and Authoritarianism

Noriega's regime served as a stark reminder of the dangers of authoritarianism, corruption, and the misuse of military power, while his downfall catalyzed significant political and institutional changes that would pave the way for Panama's modern democracy.[^78] His career illustrated the dangers of intelligence agencies maintaining relationships with morally compromised assets, as the CIA's long-standing support for Noriega became increasingly untenable as his criminal activities became public knowledge.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some defenders of Noriega, particularly among Panamanian nationalists and anti-American leftists, have argued that his regime represented resistance to U.S. imperialism in Central America. They point to his continuation of Omar Torrijos's policies regarding the eventual transfer of the Panama Canal and his support for revolutionary movements in Central America as evidence of nationalist credentials.

Certain scholars have noted that Noriega's intelligence work did provide valuable information to the United States during the Cold War, particularly regarding Cuban and Nicaraguan activities in the region. His willingness to allow U.S. listening posts in Panama and facilitate operations against the Sandinistas made him a valuable asset during a period when the Reagan administration viewed Central America as a critical Cold War battleground.

Some economic analysts have acknowledged that during Noriega's rule, Panama maintained its position as a regional financial center, with considerable capital flows and economic activity, though this argument is severely undermined by the recognition that much of this activity was related to money laundering and drug trafficking.

In certain Panamanian circles, particularly among former members of the PDF, Noriega is remembered as a strong leader who maintained order and stood up to American pressure, at least until the final years of his regime. These defenders argue that the democratic governments that followed have been plagued by corruption and inefficiency, though this comparison conveniently ignores the systematic human rights abuses of Noriega's dictatorship.

### Negative Views

The overwhelming scholarly consensus views Noriega as a brutal dictator whose regime was characterized by corruption, human rights abuses, and criminal enterprise. Historian John Dinges, who wrote extensively about Noriega, documented the systematic torture, murder, and repression carried out by his G-2 intelligence service.[^79]

Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have consistently condemned Noriega's record. When Noriega was extradited to Panama in 2011, Amnesty International stated that he "must face justice in Panama" for extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, detention without trial and the torture and ill-treatment of demonstrators.[^80]

Legal scholars point to Noriega's case as an important precedent in international law, as he became the first foreign head of state to be tried and convicted in a U.S. criminal court for crimes committed in his own country. The legal basis for this prosecution and the invasion that preceded it remains controversial in international law circles.

Political scientists have characterized Noriega's regime as a classic example of a narco-kleptocracy—a government fundamentally corrupted by drug money and organized crime. The 1988 Senate Subcommittee investigation revealed the extent to which U.S. agencies had been complicit in enabling Noriega's criminal activities, raising serious questions about the accountability of intelligence services.

The Council on Foreign Relations, in its assessment following Noriega's death in 2017, concluded that his legacy was one of "corruption, repression, and a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of Cold War alliances."[^81] This view emphasizes that the U.S. policy of supporting authoritarian anti-communist allies, regardless of their human rights records or criminal activities, ultimately proved counterproductive and morally indefensible.
