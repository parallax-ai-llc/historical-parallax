## Summary

Mazu Daoyi was one of the most influential Chan (Zen) masters in Chinese Buddhist history. He and his lineage dominated the 'Golden Age' of Chan in the Tang Dynasty. He pioneered unconventional teaching methods including shouting, hitting, and startling students. His famous declaration 'This mind is Buddha' and its reversal 'Neither mind nor Buddha' exemplified Chan's paradoxical approach. Nearly all major Chan lineages descend from him.
