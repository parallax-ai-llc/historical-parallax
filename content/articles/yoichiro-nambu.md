## Summary

Yoichiro Nambu was a Japanese-American physicist who won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the mechanism of spontaneous broken symmetry in subatomic physics. His concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking became fundamental to the Standard Model and led to the prediction of the Higgs mechanism. He also introduced the concept of color charge in quantum chromodynamics. Nambu is considered one of the founders of string theory.
