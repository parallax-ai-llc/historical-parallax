## Summary

Eric Liddell was a Scottish Olympic gold medalist and Christian missionary to China. He famously refused to run in the 100-meter heats at the 1924 Paris Olympics because they were held on Sunday, then won the 400 meters. He returned to China as a missionary and was interned by the Japanese during World War II. He died of a brain tumor in the internment camp; his story was told in the film Chariots of Fire.
