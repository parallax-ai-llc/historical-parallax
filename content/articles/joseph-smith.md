## Summary

Joseph Smith Jr. (1805-1844) was an American religious leader and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, which gave rise to Mormonism and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Born in Sharon, Vermont, Smith claimed to have received divine revelations beginning in his youth, including visions of God and Jesus Christ, and later translated the Book of Mormon, which he said was inscribed on golden plates shown to him by an angel.[^1] He established the Church of Christ in 1830 in upstate New York and led a growing religious movement that faced intense persecution, forcing multiple relocations from New York to Ohio, Missouri, and finally Illinois.[^2] Smith's life ended violently when he was killed by a mob while imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, at age 38, leaving behind a complex legacy as either a prophetic visionary or a controversial charlatan, depending on perspective.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Joseph Smith Jr. was born on December 23, 1805, in Sharon, Windsor County, Vermont, to Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith.[^4] He was the fifth of eleven children in a family that struggled economically, moving frequently throughout New England in search of better opportunities.[^5] The Smith family experienced significant financial hardship, which led them to relocate to Palmyra, New York, in 1816, and later to nearby Manchester, where they attempted to establish themselves through farming.[^6]

Young Joseph grew up during the Second Great Awakening, a period of intense religious revivalism that swept through the northeastern United States in the early 19th century.[^7] The region where the Smiths settled in upstate New York was known as the "burned-over district" due to the frequency and intensity of religious enthusiasm that characterized the area.[^8] This environment of competing religious denominations and revival meetings would profoundly influence Smith's spiritual development.[^9]

Smith received limited formal education, attending school only sporadically due to his family's economic circumstances and frequent moves.[^10] Despite this, he developed an interest in religious matters from an early age, influenced by his family's own spiritual searching and the religious fervor surrounding them.[^11] His mother, Lucy Mack Smith, later recounted that young Joseph was contemplative and concerned with religious questions, though the family did not belong to any particular church during his youth.[^12]

According to Smith's own account, written years later, he experienced his first vision in the spring of 1820, at age 14, when he went into a grove of trees near his home to pray about which church to join.[^13] Smith claimed that God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him in this "First Vision" and told him not to join any existing church, as they had all strayed from the true gospel.[^14] This foundational experience, which Smith did not publicly discuss until the 1830s, would become central to Latter-day Saint theology, though historical scholars have noted inconsistencies in the various accounts Smith gave of this vision over time.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Smith's rise to religious prominence began in earnest in September 1823, when he claimed to have been visited by an angel named Moroni, who told him about an ancient record inscribed on golden plates buried in a nearby hill.[^16] According to Smith's account, Moroni appeared to him annually for four years, instructing him before finally allowing him to retrieve the plates in 1827.[^17] Smith said the plates contained a record of ancient American civilizations and their interactions with Jesus Christ, written in "reformed Egyptian" characters that he would translate through divine inspiration using special stones called the Urim and Thummim.[^18]

The translation process, which Smith conducted behind a curtain or barrier, involved him dictating to various scribes, most notably Oliver Cowdery, Martin Harris, and his wife Emma.[^19] Witnesses described Smith placing a seer stone in a hat, putting his face into the hat to exclude light, and then reading the English translation that appeared miraculously.[^20] The resulting manuscript became the Book of Mormon, published in March 1830 in Palmyra, New York, with an initial print run of 5,000 copies financed by Martin Harris, who mortgaged his farm to cover the printing costs.[^21]

On April 6, 1830, Smith formally organized the Church of Christ (later renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) in Fayette, New York, with six founding members.[^22] The church grew rapidly, attracting converts through missionary work and the compelling narrative of the Book of Mormon, which offered answers to theological questions prominent in American religious discourse, particularly regarding the indigenous peoples of the Americas.[^23] Early converts included members of Smith's family, as well as charismatic leaders like Brigham Young, who would later succeed Smith as the faith's leader.[^24]

Smith's prophetic claims and the establishment of a new religion met with intense opposition from the beginning. Accusations of fraud related to his earlier involvement in folk magic and treasure hunting, as well as his monetary digging activities, followed him and damaged his credibility among critics.[^25] Despite this opposition, Smith's movement continued to grow, and he relocated the church headquarters to Kirtland, Ohio, in 1831, establishing a pattern of migration that would characterize much of the movement's early history.[^26]

In Kirtland, Smith consolidated his religious and temporal authority, receiving revelations that were compiled into the Doctrine and Covenants, and establishing the Law of Consecration, a communal economic system.[^27] He also began work on the Kirtland Temple, dedicated in 1836, which became a center for important religious ceremonies and visions.[^28] However, the failure of the church's Kirtland Safety Society bank in 1837 during the Panic of 1837 led to significant dissension within the church and forced Smith to flee to Missouri to escape creditors and dissenters.[^29]

## Major Achievements

Joseph Smith's most enduring achievement was the establishment of a new religious tradition that would grow into a worldwide faith with millions of adherents. The publication of the Book of Mormon in 1830 represented a remarkable feat, whether viewed as a work of inspired scripture or creative fiction, given Smith's limited formal education.[^30] The book provided a comprehensive theological narrative that addressed contemporary American concerns about the origins of Native Americans, the nature of the Christian gospel, and the role of America in God's plan.[^31]

Smith's organizational abilities manifested in his creation of a complex ecclesiastical structure for his growing church. He established a hierarchical priesthood system with two orders—the Aaronic and Melchizedek priesthoods—and created various governing bodies including the First Presidency, the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy.[^32] This organizational framework provided stability and continuity that enabled the church to survive Smith's death and continue growing under successive leadership.[^33]

Beyond the Book of Mormon, Smith produced a substantial body of revelatory texts. The Doctrine and Covenants, a collection of his revelations, provided ongoing guidance to the church on matters of doctrine, organization, and practice.[^34] His translation of the Pearl of Great Price, which included the Book of Moses and the Book of Abraham (translated from Egyptian papyri he purchased in 1835), expanded Latter-day Saint cosmology and theology.[^35] Smith also began an ambitious revision of the King James Bible, which he called the Joseph Smith Translation, though he never completed it before his death.[^36]

Smith's vision extended beyond purely religious matters to encompass political and social organization. In Nauvoo, Illinois, where the church relocated in 1839, Smith established a near-autonomous city-state with its own militia (the Nauvoo Legion), university, and legal system.[^37] Under his leadership, Nauvoo grew rapidly, becoming one of the largest cities in Illinois with a population exceeding 12,000 by 1844.[^38] Smith served as the city's mayor, the commander of its militia with the rank of lieutenant general, and the chief justice of its municipal court, consolidating religious and secular authority in his person.[^39]

In religious practice, Smith introduced distinctive doctrines that set Mormonism apart from traditional Christianity. These included the concept of continuing revelation, the belief in multiple heavens or "degrees of glory," the doctrine of eternal progression (the idea that humans can become like God), baptism for the dead, and celestial marriage.[^40] The temple ceremonies he developed, incorporating Masonic elements he encountered after joining Freemasonry in 1842, created sacred rituals that became central to Latter-day Saint worship.[^41]

Smith's political ambitions culminated in his 1844 candidacy for President of the United States, running on a platform that included the abolition of slavery through compensation to slaveholders, the establishment of a national bank, prison reform, and the annexation of Texas and Oregon.[^42] While his campaign had no realistic chance of success, it demonstrated his vision of Mormonism as a transformative force in American society and his willingness to engage with national political issues.[^43]

The gathering of converts from Europe and the eastern United States to centralized Mormon communities represented another significant achievement. Smith's missionary program successfully converted thousands, particularly in Great Britain, creating a international movement that would eventually spread worldwide.[^44] His ability to inspire loyalty and sacrifice among his followers, who repeatedly uprooted their lives to follow him from New York to Ohio to Missouri to Illinois, demonstrated remarkable charismatic leadership.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Joseph Smith's life and leadership were marked by persistent controversy that began with his early claims of divine visions and continued until his death. His involvement in folk magic and treasure hunting before founding his church provided ammunition for critics who characterized him as a fraud and charlatan.[^46] In 1826, Smith was brought before a court in Bainbridge, New York, on charges related to being a "disorderly person" for his glass-looking activities, an incident that critics have interpreted as evidence of his fraudulent character, though the exact outcome of the proceeding remains disputed.[^47]

The practice of plural marriage, or polygamy, represents perhaps the most controversial aspect of Smith's legacy. While Smith publicly denied practicing polygamy during his lifetime, historical evidence demonstrates that he secretly married multiple women, with estimates ranging from 30 to 40 plural wives, beginning as early as the mid-1830s.[^48] Some of these marriages were to women who were already married to other men (polyandry), and several involved teenage girls, including Helen Mar Kimball, who was 14 when she married Smith.[^49] This practice created tension within the church, contributed to dissension among church members, and provided external critics with evidence of moral corruption.[^50]

Smith's consolidation of religious, political, and military power in Nauvoo alarmed non-Mormon neighbors and raised concerns about theocracy and the erosion of democratic principles.[^51] His use of the Nauvoo Legion, which at its peak numbered around 2,000 men, to enforce his will and protect against perceived threats appeared to many as the creation of a private army.[^52] The city's practice of harboring individuals fleeing prosecution in other jurisdictions through the liberal use of habeas corpus writs further antagonized surrounding communities and state officials.[^53]

The destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor, a dissident newspaper that published one issue exposing Smith's practice of polygamy and criticizing his theocratic rule, precipitated the final crisis of his life.[^54] On June 10, 1844, Smith, acting as Nauvoo's mayor, ordered the city council to declare the newspaper a public nuisance and had the city marshal destroy the printing press.[^55] This act, which violated freedom of the press, led to charges of riot against Smith and contributed to the chain of events that ended with his death.[^56]

Smith's leadership style was often authoritarian, brooking little dissent and sometimes using the threat of divine punishment to quell opposition.[^57] Dissenters who left the church frequently reported feeling manipulated or controlled, and Smith issued revelations condemning those who questioned his authority.[^58] The formation of secret societies within the church, including the Danites in Missouri (a group accused of vigilante violence against church enemies) and the Council of Fifty in Nauvoo (which some viewed as a shadow government), raised concerns about Smith's ultimate ambitions.[^59]

Financial controversies plagued Smith's career, from the failure of the Kirtland Safety Society bank to accusations of mismanagement of church funds.[^60] The bank's collapse in 1837 cost many faithful members their life savings and led to widespread apostasy among the Kirtland membership.[^61] Critics accused Smith of using his religious authority to enrich himself and his family, though defenders argue that Smith died in poverty and used resources for church purposes.[^62]

Smith's claims about the Book of Abraham, translated from Egyptian papyri he purchased in 1835, have been particularly problematic for the church in the modern era. When portions of the papyri were rediscovered in 1967 and examined by Egyptologists, they were identified as common Egyptian funerary texts (the Book of Breathings) dating to around the first century BCE, with no relationship to the content Smith had translated.[^63] This discrepancy has provided critics with what they view as concrete evidence that Smith's claims to translate ancient texts through divine inspiration were fraudulent.[^64]

## Personal Life

Joseph Smith married Emma Hale on January 18, 1827, in South Bainbridge, New York, eloping without the consent of Emma's father, Isaac Hale, who disapproved of Smith and his activities.[^65] Emma proved to be a devoted, if sometimes troubled, companion throughout Smith's tumultuous career, serving as one of his scribes during the translation of the Book of Mormon and standing by him through multiple relocations and periods of intense persecution.[^66] The couple's relationship was tested by Smith's practice of plural marriage, which Emma sometimes accepted and sometimes resisted, leading to periods of tension in their marriage.[^67]

The Smiths experienced profound tragedy in their family life, with only five of Emma's eleven pregnancies resulting in children who survived infancy: Alvin (adopted), Joseph III, Frederick, Alexander, and David Hyrum.[^68] The couple adopted twins, Joseph and Julia Murdock, in 1831 after their mother died in childbirth, though Joseph died at eleven months, possibly due to exposure when a mob attacked Smith's home.[^69] These losses deeply affected both Joseph and Emma, and Smith's theology eventually incorporated doctrines about eternal families and the sealing of family relationships that may have been influenced by this personal grief.[^70]

Smith was described by contemporaries as physically imposing, standing over six feet tall with a powerful build, blue eyes, and light brown hair.[^71] He possessed considerable personal charisma and social skills, able to inspire deep loyalty and affection among his followers.[^72] He enjoyed wrestling and other physical activities, and was known for his sense of humor and playfulness, sometimes engaging in activities that critics considered inappropriate for a religious prophet.[^73]

Despite his role as a religious leader, Smith engaged actively in business ventures, including operating a store in Nauvoo and involving himself in land speculation and other commercial activities.[^74] His financial dealings were often intertwined with church affairs, blurring the lines between personal and institutional finances in ways that sometimes created conflicts of interest.[^75]

Smith's relationship with his plural wives varied considerably. While some marriages appear to have been primarily spiritual or dynastic (linking prominent families to the prophet), others were conjugal.[^76] Some wives, like Eliza R. Snow, became influential leaders in the church, while others, like Fanny Alger, left the church entirely.[^77] The secrecy surrounding these marriages created complicated emotional dynamics, with wives unable to publicly acknowledge their relationship to Smith.[^78]

## Legacy

Joseph Smith's death on June 27, 1844, when he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob that stormed Carthage Jail, transformed him into a martyr for his followers and ensured his enduring significance in religious history.[^79] The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which he founded, has grown from those humble beginnings to become a worldwide faith with over 17 million members in 2025, making it one of the fastest-growing religious movements in modern history.[^80] The church's emphasis on family values, education, and missionary work reflects Smith's original vision, even as the institution has evolved significantly since his death.[^81]

Smith's theological innovations have had lasting impact beyond the LDS Church itself. His teachings on the nature of God, the potential for human deification, the importance of continuing revelation, and the practice of baptism for the dead represent distinctive contributions to American religious thought.[^82] The Book of Mormon has been published in over 110 languages and remains central to Latter-day Saint identity, while also attracting scholarly attention as an example of 19th-century American religious literature.[^83]

The succession crisis following Smith's death led to the fragmentation of the Latter Day Saint movement into numerous denominations, with the largest groups following Brigham Young west to Utah (becoming the modern LDS Church) and following Smith's son, Joseph Smith III, in what became the Community of Christ (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints).[^84] These various branches preserve different aspects of Smith's legacy and interpret his teachings in diverse ways, from the conservative traditionalism of the Utah-based church to the more liberal approach of the Community of Christ.[^85]

Smith's influence on American culture extends beyond religion. The Mormon migration to Utah under Brigham Young, motivated by persecution that began during Smith's lifetime, played a significant role in the settlement of the American West.[^86] Mormon communities established irrigation techniques, cooperative economic systems, and civic institutions that shaped the development of multiple western states.[^87] The distinctive Mormon culture that emerged from Smith's teachings has contributed to American literature, music, business, and politics.[^88]

Nauvoo, Illinois, where Smith spent his final years, has been partially restored and serves as a historic site visited by thousands annually, preserving the memory of his most ambitious city-building project.[^89] Palmyra, New York, site of the First Vision and the translation of the Book of Mormon, hosts the annual Hill Cumorah Pageant and attracts pilgrims from around the world.[^90] These locations have become pilgrimage sites that keep Smith's story alive for new generations of believers.[^91]

In academic circles, Smith has become a subject of increasing scholarly interest, with historians, religious studies scholars, and sociologists examining his life, teachings, and the movement he founded.[^92] The Joseph Smith Papers project, initiated in 2001, has worked to publish all documents related to Smith, providing unprecedented access to primary sources and enabling more sophisticated historical analysis.[^93] This scholarship has complicated simple narratives about Smith, revealing him as a more complex figure than either hagiographic or hostile accounts suggest.[^94]

Smith's legacy remains contested in American public life. For faithful Latter-day Saints, he is a prophet who restored Christ's true church and received genuine divine revelations.[^95] For critics, he represents religious deception, the dangers of charismatic authority, and the problematic aspects of American religious enthusiasm.[^96] This divide ensures that Smith remains a figure of ongoing debate and reinterpretation, with his significance extending far beyond his brief 38 years of life.[^97]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Latter-day Saint scholars and believers view Joseph Smith as a genuine prophet who received divine revelations and restored the fullness of the Christian gospel after centuries of apostasy.[^98] They point to his ability to produce the Book of Mormon as evidence of divine inspiration, arguing that an uneducated farm boy could not have created such a complex theological and narrative work without supernatural assistance.[^99] Church historian Richard Bushman, in his comprehensive biography "Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling," presents Smith as a sincere religious visionary who genuinely believed in his divine calling, even while acknowledging the complexities and controversies of his life.[^100]

Defenders of Smith's legacy emphasize his role as an innovative religious thinker who addressed fundamental theological questions in creative ways. His rejection of the Trinity in favor of a materialist conception of God, his teaching about the pre-existence of souls and eternal progression, and his emphasis on the corporeality of the divine represented radical departures from traditional Christianity that some scholars view as genuine theological innovation.[^101] Terryl Givens, a prominent Mormon scholar, argues that Smith's theological vision offered a uniquely American form of Christianity that emphasized human agency, the goodness of the material world, and optimism about human potential.[^102]

Some historians credit Smith with remarkable leadership abilities and organizational skills, noting his success in creating institutions that survived his death and continued to grow.[^103] His establishment of a cooperative economic system, the Law of Consecration, and his attempts to create utopian communities reflected broader 19th-century American impulses toward social experimentation and reform.[^104] Scholar Jan Shipps has described Smith as a religious genius who created a new religious tradition rather than simply a new denomination, comparable in significance to Muhammad or Buddha in founding a distinct faith tradition.[^105]

Supporters point to Smith's relatively progressive views on certain social issues, including his evolving position on slavery (he ultimately advocated for compensated emancipation) and his empowerment of women through temple ordinances and leadership roles, even within a patriarchal framework.[^106] The Relief Society, which Smith organized in 1842 as a women's organization, gave women unprecedented opportunities for organization and leadership in religious life.[^107]

Mormon apologists argue that many criticisms of Smith reflect anti-religious bias or misunderstanding of 19th-century cultural context. They note that practices like plural marriage, while offensive to modern sensibilities, had biblical precedent and were practiced by Smith for religious rather than licentious reasons.[^108] They also point to Smith's personal sufferings—including being tarred and feathered, imprisoned multiple times, and ultimately killed for his beliefs—as evidence of his sincerity and willingness to sacrifice for his convictions.[^109]

### Negative Views

Critics of Joseph Smith, including historians, former church members, and religious skeptics, characterize him as a fraudulent charlatan who invented his religious claims for personal gain, power, and sexual access to women.[^110] They point to his early involvement in treasure hunting using seer stones as evidence of a pattern of deception that continued with his religious claims.[^111] The lack of archaeological evidence for the civilizations described in the Book of Mormon, linguistic problems with Smith's claims about reformed Egyptian, and DNA evidence contradicting the book's account of Native American origins have been cited as proof that the Book of Mormon is a work of fiction rather than ancient history.[^112]

Historian Fawn Brodie's controversial 1945 biography "No Man Knows My History" presented Smith as a conscious fraud who created Mormonism to satisfy his need for power and admiration.[^113] While later historians have criticized Brodie's psychoanalytic approach and some of her conclusions, her work established a critical tradition of Smith scholarship that emphasizes his human limitations and contradictions rather than divine inspiration.[^114] More recent critical biographers have generally presented Smith as a more complex figure who may have believed his own claims while still engaging in deception and manipulation.[^115]

The practice of polygamy and polyandry has been a focal point of criticism, with opponents arguing that Smith used his religious authority to coerce young women and other men's wives into sexual relationships.[^116] Some plural wives reported being promised that their entire family would be saved if they married Smith, or being threatened with destruction if they refused, suggesting the use of spiritual manipulation.[^117] The secrecy surrounding these marriages, and Smith's public denials of practicing polygamy even while accumulating wives, are viewed as evidence of his dishonesty and moral corruption.[^118]

Critics point to the authoritarian nature of Smith's leadership and his intolerance of dissent as evidence of his true character. The destruction of the Nauvoo Expositor, in particular, is cited as an example of Smith's willingness to violate fundamental principles of freedom and democracy to protect his power.[^119] Former church members who left during Smith's lifetime, including some of his closest associates like Oliver Cowdery and David Whitmer, reported feeling manipulated and controlled by Smith, though some later returned to the church or affirmed their testimony of the Book of Mormon.[^120]

The violence associated with early Mormonism, including the activities of the Danites in Missouri and armed conflicts with non-Mormon neighbors, has been attributed to Smith's rhetoric and leadership, even when he was not directly involved.[^121] Critics argue that Smith's apocalyptic worldview and his casting of outsiders as enemies of God created a culture that made violence more likely.[^122]

Modern secular historians generally view Smith as a product of his time and place, influenced by the religious enthusiasms, folk magic traditions, and social concerns of early 19th-century America.[^123] They argue that the Book of Mormon reflects contemporary debates about Native American origins, religious controversies about infant baptism and predestination, and even specific language from the King James Bible and other texts available in Smith's environment.[^124] From this perspective, Smith was a creative religious innovator, but not a recipient of divine revelation.[^125]
