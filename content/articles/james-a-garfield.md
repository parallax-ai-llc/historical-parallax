## Summary

James Abram Garfield served as the 20th President of the United States for only 200 days in 1881 before being assassinated, making his presidency one of the shortest in American history. A self-made man who rose from poverty in rural Ohio to the highest office in the land, Garfield was a distinguished Civil War general, nine-term congressman, and skilled orator known for his intellectual prowess and integrity. His presidency, though brief, was marked by efforts to reform the civil service system and resist the political patronage demands of his own party. His death from an assassin's bullet, combined with the prolonged medical incompetence that followed the shooting, shocked the nation and ultimately spurred significant civil service reform, making his legacy far more substantial than his short time in office might suggest.

## Early Life and Background

James Abram Garfield was born on November 19, 1831, in a log cabin in Orange Township, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, the youngest of five children born to Abram and Eliza Ballou Garfield[^1]. His father, a wrestling champion and community leader, died when James was only eighteen months old, leaving the family in desperate poverty[^2]. Garfield's early years were marked by hardship as his mother struggled to keep the family farm and raise her children alone, refusing offers to send her children to orphanages[^3].

Despite these humble beginnings, young Garfield demonstrated an insatiable appetite for learning. He worked as a canal boat driver at age sixteen, an experience that nearly cost him his life when he fell into the canal fourteen times in six weeks[^4]. This near-death experience convinced him to pursue education more seriously. He attended the Geauga Seminary and later the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute (now Hiram College), where he worked as a janitor to pay his tuition[^5].

Garfield's intellectual abilities flourished at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he enrolled in 1854 and graduated with honors in 1856[^6]. He was particularly gifted in classical languages, mathematics, and rhetoric. After graduation, he returned to the Eclectic Institute as a professor and became its president at age twenty-six[^7]. During this period, he also studied law and was admitted to the Ohio bar in 1860, though he never practiced extensively[^8].

His early life experiences instilled in him a deep belief in education and self-improvement as pathways out of poverty, themes that would characterize his political philosophy throughout his career. Garfield was also influenced by his mother's devout Christian faith, joining the Disciples of Christ church and occasionally serving as a lay preacher[^9]. His frontier upbringing, combined with his classical education, created a unique blend of practical wisdom and intellectual sophistication that distinguished him from many of his political contemporaries.

## Rise to Power

Garfield's entry into politics coincided with the tumultuous years leading to the Civil War. An ardent opponent of slavery, he joined the newly formed Republican Party and won election to the Ohio State Senate in 1859[^10]. When the Civil War erupted in 1861, Garfield, despite having no military training, volunteered for service and was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel in the 42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry[^11].

His military career was distinguished and rapid. Garfield commanded Union forces at the Battle of Middle Creek in January 1862, one of the few Union victories in the war's early stages, which earned him promotion to brigadier general at age thirty[^12]. He served with distinction at the Battle of Shiloh and later as chief of staff to General William Rosecrans during the Chickamauga Campaign[^13]. His bravery at Chickamauga, where he rode through Confederate lines to deliver crucial messages, earned him promotion to major general[^14].

While still serving in the army, Garfield was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1862, though he did not take his seat until December 1863 after President Lincoln personally urged him to serve in Congress[^15]. This began a remarkable seventeen-year congressional career, during which Garfield became one of the most influential Republicans in the House. He served on numerous important committees, including Ways and Means, Military Affairs, and Banking and Currency[^16].

Garfield quickly established himself as an expert on financial matters, becoming a leading voice on currency and tariff issues during Reconstruction. He served as House Minority Leader and was a key figure in Republican Party politics throughout the 1870s[^17]. His eloquence and intellectual depth made him a sought-after speaker, and his ability to read and write simultaneously in both Latin and Greek became legendary in Washington circles[^18].

His rise to the presidency was unexpected. At the 1880 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Garfield attended as a supporter of fellow Ohioan John Sherman[^19]. The convention deadlocked between former President Ulysses S. Grant, seeking an unprecedented third term, and reform candidate James G. Blaine. On the 36th ballot, exhausted delegates turned to Garfield as a dark horse compromise candidate[^20]. He accepted the nomination reluctantly, later writing that he had "never had the presidential fever" and that the nomination came to him "not by my seeking"[^21].

## Major Achievements

Despite serving only 200 days before being shot and less than four months in office before his death, Garfield's presidency and prior congressional career were marked by significant achievements that demonstrated his principled leadership and intellectual capacity[^22].

During his congressional tenure, Garfield was instrumental in shaping post-Civil War financial policy. As chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, he advocated for sound money policies and a return to the gold standard, opposing the inflationary Greenback movement that was popular in agricultural regions[^23]. His expertise in fiscal matters earned him respect even from political opponents, and his 1874 speech on currency reform was considered one of the finest addresses on economic policy delivered in Congress during that era[^24].

Garfield was also a champion of civil rights during Reconstruction, consistently supporting legislation to protect the rights of formerly enslaved people. He voted for the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and supported the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which prohibited racial discrimination in public accommodations[^25]. Though his commitment to racial equality would be tested by political pragmatism later in his career, his early congressional record showed genuine concern for the welfare of African Americans[^26].

As President, Garfield's most significant achievement was his courageous stand against the corrupt patronage system known as the "spoils system." He clashed with New York Senator Roscoe Conkling, the powerful leader of the Republican Party's Stalwart faction, over appointments to the New York Custom House, the most lucrative source of patronage jobs in the federal government[^27]. When Conkling demanded control over these appointments, Garfield refused, asserting presidential authority and declaring, "This brings on the contest at once and will settle the question whether the President is registering clerk of the Senate or the Executive of the United States"[^28].

This confrontation led Conkling and his fellow New York senator to resign their seats in protest, expecting to be triumphantly re-elected by the New York legislature as a rebuke to Garfield. Instead, the legislature refused to return them to office, marking a significant defeat for machine politics and a victory for presidential independence[^29]. This episode, though brief, demonstrated Garfield's willingness to fight political corruption even within his own party.

Garfield also worked to strengthen American diplomatic relations, particularly in Latin America. He advocated for a more Pan-American approach to foreign policy and supported efforts to build closer ties with South American nations[^30]. His Secretary of State, James G. Blaine, began planning what would eventually become the Pan-American Conference, though Garfield's death delayed these initiatives[^31].

In educational matters, Garfield was a strong advocate for federal support of public education. He believed that universal education was essential for democracy and economic progress, a conviction born from his own experience rising from poverty through learning[^32]. He supported legislation to provide federal aid to schools, particularly in the South where educational infrastructure had been devastated by the Civil War[^33].

Garfield's intellectual achievements were also noteworthy. He was the only president to have contributed an original proof to mathematics—his elegant proof of the Pythagorean theorem, published in the New England Journal of Education in 1876[^34]. He was fluent in multiple languages, including Latin, Greek, German, and French, and could reportedly write in Greek with one hand while simultaneously writing in Latin with the other[^35].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his reputation for integrity, Garfield's career was not without controversies that tarnished his image and raised questions about his judgment and principles. The most damaging was his connection to the Crédit Mobilier scandal of 1872-1873, one of the Gilded Age's most notorious corruption cases[^36].

The scandal involved the Crédit Mobilier of America, a construction company created by Union Pacific Railroad executives to build the transcontinental railroad while siphoning off excess profits. To prevent congressional investigation, the company's shares were distributed to influential congressmen at below-market prices[^37]. Garfield was accused of receiving twenty shares of stock and $329 in dividends, though he vehemently denied the charges[^38].

The evidence against Garfield was ambiguous. Testimony from Crédit Mobilier financier Oakes Ames suggested Garfield had accepted the stock, but Garfield insisted he had merely discussed the investment and never completed the transaction[^39]. He was never formally censured by Congress, unlike some of his colleagues, but the cloud of suspicion lingered. Critics argued that even if Garfield didn't technically accept the bribes, his willingness to consider the investment showed poor judgment and ethical blind spots[^40].

Another controversy involved the "salary grab" of 1873, when Congress voted itself a 50 percent pay increase and made it retroactive for two years. Garfield voted for the increase and accepted the retroactive payment of $5,000, a decision that provoked public outrage[^41]. Though he later claimed regret and donated part of the money to charity, his initial acceptance of the funds damaged his reputation for fiscal responsibility and principle[^42].

Garfield's stance on civil rights became increasingly compromised as Reconstruction waned. While he had been a strong supporter of African American rights in the 1860s, by the late 1870s he had become more conciliatory toward the white South, supporting the removal of federal troops from Southern states in the Compromise of 1877[^43]. Critics, particularly African American leaders, accused him of abandoning the freedmen to appease Southern Democrats and Northern business interests seeking sectional reconciliation[^44].

His presidential campaign in 1880 also drew criticism for its cynical political maneuvering. To balance the ticket and appease Roscoe Conkling's Stalwart faction, Garfield accepted Chester A. Arthur, a Conkling protégé and symbol of the patronage system, as his running mate[^45]. This choice seemed to contradict Garfield's reform principles and suggested he was willing to compromise with the very machine politics he claimed to oppose[^46].

Some historians have also criticized Garfield's indecisiveness and tendency toward political calculation over principle. His biographer Allan Peskin noted that Garfield often agonized over decisions, seeking to please multiple factions and sometimes appearing weak or inconsistent[^47]. His diary entries reveal a man frequently torn between his idealistic vision and the pragmatic demands of politics, leading to accusations that he lacked the forceful leadership necessary for the presidency[^48].

Additionally, Garfield's personal life included a prolonged extramarital affair with a New York widow named Lucia Calhoun in the 1860s, which he confessed to his wife Lucretia in a tearful admission that nearly ended their marriage[^49]. While this was kept private during his lifetime, it has led some modern historians to question the extent of his moral rectitude[^50].

## Personal Life

James Garfield married Lucretia Rudolph on November 11, 1858, in a relationship that began tentatively but grew into a deep partnership[^51]. Lucretia, whom he called "Crete," was a fellow student at the Eclectic Institute and shared his intellectual interests, though Garfield initially had doubts about his feelings for her[^52]. Their early marriage was strained by Garfield's ambition, frequent absences, and his affair with Lucia Calhoun, but they reconciled and developed a genuinely affectionate relationship in later years[^53].

The couple had seven children, though two died in infancy. Their surviving children were Harry Augustus, James Rudolph, Mary (Mollie), Irvin McDowell, and Abram[^54]. Garfield was an attentive if often absent father, writing lengthy letters to his children filled with advice and affection. He delighted in intellectual discussions with his older sons and took pride in their education[^55].

Garfield's personality was complex and often contradictory. He was intellectually brilliant but sometimes socially awkward, prone to self-doubt despite his obvious talents. His diary reveals a man of deep introspection, constantly analyzing his own motives and actions with almost painful honesty[^56]. He struggled with what he called "a divided mind," torn between his desire for quiet scholarly life and his ambition for political achievement[^57].

Friends and colleagues described him as warm, generous, and engaging in conversation, with an exceptional memory and wide-ranging knowledge that made him fascinating company[^58]. He loved books, music, and intellectual debate, often reading multiple volumes simultaneously and maintaining extensive correspondence with scholars and friends[^59]. His personal library contained thousands of volumes in multiple languages[^60].

Physically, Garfield was an imposing figure—over six feet tall with broad shoulders and a powerful build that reflected his frontier upbringing. He had light brown hair, blue eyes, and a full beard that became grayer as he aged[^61]. He enjoyed physical activity, including swimming, horseback riding, and billiards, and maintained his strength through regular exercise even during his busy congressional years[^62].

Despite his political success, Garfield often expressed weariness with Washington's partisan conflicts and longed for a quieter life of scholarship and teaching. His diary entries frequently mention feelings of exhaustion and moral fatigue from the compromises required in politics[^63]. Yet he found it difficult to extract himself from public life, driven by both ambition and a sense of duty to the Republican Party and the nation[^64].

Garfield's relationship with money was sometimes troubled. Despite his advocacy for sound fiscal policy in government, he frequently struggled with personal debts and made questionable investments, including speculating in Washington real estate[^65]. His financial pressures contributed to his willingness to consider potentially compromising business arrangements, as in the Crédit Mobilier case[^66].

## Legacy

James Garfield's legacy far exceeds what might be expected from a president who served less than four months in office. His assassination and the prolonged agony of his death—he survived for 79 days after being shot, suffering through botched medical treatments that likely hastened his demise—shocked the nation and catalyzed significant political reforms[^67].

The most direct result of Garfield's death was the passage of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act of 1883, which established a merit-based system for federal employment and ended much of the corrupt patronage system that had dominated American politics for decades[^68]. Ironically, the act was signed into law by Chester A. Arthur, Garfield's vice president and former stalwart of the patronage system, who was transformed by his succession to the presidency[^69]. Garfield's martyrdom provided the political momentum that reformers had long sought but could not achieve while he lived[^70].

Garfield's principled stand against Roscoe Conkling and machine politics established an important precedent for presidential independence from congressional and party bosses. His refusal to capitulate to Conkling's patronage demands demonstrated that the presidency could be a powerful force for reform, even against entrenched political interests[^71]. This strengthened the executive branch's authority in ways that benefited his successors[^72].

In historical memory, Garfield occupies an unusual position—neither forgotten like some other brief presidents nor celebrated as a transformative leader. He is often remembered as "the Great Might-Have-Been," with historians speculating about what he might have accomplished had he lived[^73]. His intellectual gifts, integrity, and reform instincts suggest he could have been a significant president, though his earlier political compromises raise questions about how effectively he would have challenged the Gilded Age's systemic corruption[^74].

Garfield's life story—rising from poverty to the presidency through education and self-improvement—embodied the American Dream and inspired generations of Americans. His log cabin birth became a symbol of democratic possibility, and his intellectual achievements demonstrated that self-made men could match or exceed the cultured elite[^75]. African American leaders, despite disappointment with his later compromises on civil rights, recognized him as more sympathetic to their cause than most white politicians of his era[^76].

The medical incompetence that characterized Garfield's treatment after being shot also had lasting impacts on American medicine. His doctors' insistence on probing his wounds with unwashed hands and instruments, against the advice of younger physicians familiar with Joseph Lister's antiseptic methods, likely caused the infections that killed him[^77]. The autopsy revealed that the bullet had lodged in a non-fatal location, and Garfield would likely have survived with proper care[^78]. This medical disaster helped accelerate the acceptance of germ theory and antiseptic practices in American medicine[^79].

Garfield's brief presidency also highlighted the inadequacy of provisions for presidential disability. For weeks after the shooting, as Garfield lay incapacitated, the nation had no functioning president, yet Vice President Arthur hesitated to assume power for fear of appearing to usurp authority[^80]. This constitutional ambiguity would not be fully resolved until the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967[^81].

In popular culture, Garfield has been overshadowed by his assassin, Charles Guiteau, whose trial became a spectacle and whose delusional claims of divine inspiration fascinated the public[^82]. Yet in recent decades, historians have shown renewed interest in Garfield himself, with major biographies by Allan Peskin, Ira Rutkow, and Candice Millard bringing his life and achievements to wider audiences[^83].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians sympathetic to Garfield emphasize his exceptional intellectual abilities, genuine commitment to reform, and the courage he displayed in confronting corrupt political machines. Presidential historian C.W. Goodyear notes that Garfield "possessed perhaps the finest mind of any nineteenth-century president," with scholarly achievements that rivaled Thomas Jefferson's[^84].

Biographer Candice Millard, in her bestselling "Destiny of the Republic," portrays Garfield as a tragic hero whose life represented the best possibilities of American democracy—a self-made man of principle destroyed by the very political corruption he sought to eliminate[^85]. She argues that his confrontation with Conkling showed genuine moral courage and that his brief presidency suggested he would have been a transformative leader had he lived[^86].

Allan Peskin, Garfield's definitive academic biographer, concludes that Garfield was "an extraordinary man" whose intellectual and moral qualities were evident despite his political compromises[^87]. Peskin argues that Garfield's evolution from hardline Reconstructionist to conciliator reflected pragmatic leadership rather than abandonment of principle, as he sought to build a sustainable Republican coalition[^88].

Some scholars emphasize Garfield's progressive instincts on issues like education, civil rights, and governmental reform. Historian Justus Doenecke argues that Garfield's support for federal aid to education and his advocacy for African American rights, though imperfect, placed him well ahead of most white politicians of his era[^89]. His belief in meritocracy and opposition to hereditary privilege reflected genuinely democratic values[^90].

Defenders also note that many of the controversies surrounding Garfield involved unproven allegations or ethical standards that were different in his era. Historian Richard Jensen argues that the Crédit Mobilier charges against Garfield were likely false and that even his harshest critics acknowledged his honesty was exceptional for a Gilded Age politician[^91]. His acceptance of the salary increase, while politically damaging, was legal and accepted by most of his colleagues[^92].

Garfield's military record is universally praised, with historians noting that his success despite lacking formal training demonstrated natural strategic ability and genuine bravery. His performance at Middle Creek and Chickamauga showed he was not merely a political general but a capable military leader[^93].

### Negative Views

Critics of Garfield point to the gap between his professed principles and his actual conduct, arguing that he exemplified the moral compromises of Gilded Age politics despite his reputation for integrity. Historian Mark Wahlgren Summers characterizes Garfield as "a man of parts who never quite added up to a whole," someone whose intellectual gifts were undermined by political timidity and ethical blind spots[^94].

The Crédit Mobilier scandal remains a stain on Garfield's reputation, regardless of the ambiguous evidence. Historian Matthew Josephson argues that Garfield's willingness to even consider the investment demonstrated that he shared the era's casual attitude toward conflicts of interest and the mixing of public service with private gain[^95]. Even if he didn't technically accept bribes, his judgment was questionable[^96].

Some historians criticize Garfield's retreat from Reconstruction principles, viewing it as a betrayal of African Americans for political expediency. Eric Foner notes that Garfield's support for removing federal troops from the South in 1877 helped end Reconstruction and abandon freedmen to the mercy of white supremacist violence[^97]. While Garfield expressed private anguish over this decision, his actions contributed to the establishment of Jim Crow segregation[^98].

Critics also question whether Garfield's stand against Conkling represented genuine reform conviction or merely a power struggle over patronage distribution. Historian H.W. Brands suggests that Garfield wanted to control appointments himself rather than eliminate the patronage system, and that his reform credentials were exaggerated by sympathetic historians influenced by his martyrdom[^99].

Garfield's indecisiveness and tendency to agonize over decisions have led some historians to question whether he possessed the executive temperament necessary for effective presidential leadership. His diary reveals a man often paralyzed by competing considerations, leading to charges that he lacked the decisiveness required to implement bold reforms[^100].

His selection of Chester Arthur as running mate is cited as evidence of poor judgment and willingness to compromise principles for political advantage. Historian Thomas Reeves argues this choice "contradicted everything Garfield claimed to stand for" regarding civil service reform[^101].

Some revisionist historians also challenge the sympathetic narrative of Garfield as a victim of the spoils system, noting that he benefited from patronage throughout his career and only opposed it when it threatened his own authority[^102]. His congressional career involved numerous deals and compromises that undermine his image as an unblemished reformer[^103].
