## Summary

Kabir was a 15th-century Indian mystic, poet, and saint who is revered by Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs alike. His verses (dohas) challenged both Hindu and Muslim orthodoxy, rejecting caste, idol worship, and ritualism while pointing to the one formless God within all beings. He was a weaver by trade and expressed profound spiritual truths in simple, everyday language. His poetry is included in the Sikh Guru Granth Sahib.
