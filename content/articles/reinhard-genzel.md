## Summary

Reinhard Genzel is a German astrophysicist who shared the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics with Andrea Ghez for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of the Milky Way. He led a research group at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics that tracked the orbits of stars near the galactic center for decades. His observations provided some of the strongest evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes.
