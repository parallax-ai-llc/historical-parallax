## Summary

Thomas Gresham was an English merchant and financier who served as a royal financial agent and founded the Royal Exchange in London. He advised four monarchs on financial matters and his observation that 'bad money drives out good' became known as Gresham's Law. The Royal Exchange he built in 1571 became the center of English commercial life. He also founded Gresham College, London's first institution of higher learning.
