## Summary

Bhartrhari was an Indian philosopher and grammarian whose Vakyapadiya (On Words and Sentences) developed a profound philosophy of language identifying the supreme reality (Brahman) with the Word (Shabda). He argued that language and consciousness are inseparable and that all knowledge is essentially linguistic. He also composed the famous Shataka Traya (Three Centuries) of Sanskrit poetry on love, renunciation, and wisdom.
