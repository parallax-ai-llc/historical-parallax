## Summary

Pope John XXIII, born Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli, served as the head of the Catholic Church from 1958 until his death in 1963. Despite being elected at age 76 as a presumed "transitional pope," he became one of the most transformative pontiffs in modern Church history by convening the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), which modernized Catholic practices and opened dialogue with other faiths. His warm, approachable personality earned him the affectionate title "Good Pope John" and made him beloved worldwide, transcending religious boundaries. His brief but impactful papacy fundamentally reshaped the Catholic Church's relationship with the modern world, though his reforms remain debated among Catholics to this day. He was canonized as a saint by Pope Francis in 2014.

## Early Life and Background

Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli was born on November 25, 1881, in Sotto il Monte, a small agricultural village near Bergamo in northern Italy.[^1] He was the fourth of fourteen children born to Giovanni Battista Roncalli and Marianna Giulia Mazzola, a family of sharecroppers who worked the land for wealthy landowners.[^2] The Roncalli family lived in poverty, with all family members contributing to agricultural work to survive. Despite their humble circumstances, the family maintained a deep Catholic faith that profoundly influenced young Angelo.

At age eleven, Angelo entered the seminary in Bergamo, showing early promise as a scholar and displaying a natural inclination toward religious life.[^3] His education was supported by a local priest who recognized his intellectual potential. In 1901, he received a scholarship to study at the Pontifical Roman Seminary in Rome, where he distinguished himself in theology and church history.[^4] During his seminary years, he was particularly influenced by the teachings of St. Francis de Sales, whose emphasis on gentleness and pastoral care would shape his later ministry.

Roncalli was ordained a priest on August 10, 1904, in the Church of Santa Maria in Monte Santo in Rome.[^5] Shortly after ordination, he was appointed secretary to the new Bishop of Bergamo, Giacomo Radini-Tedeschi, a progressive prelate who exposed the young priest to social justice issues affecting workers and peasants.[^6] This experience working alongside Radini-Tedeschi from 1905 to 1914 deepened Roncalli's commitment to serving the poor and marginalized, lessons he would carry throughout his ecclesiastical career.

During World War I, Roncalli served as a sergeant in the Italian Army Medical Corps and as a military chaplain, ministering to wounded soldiers and experiencing firsthand the devastating human cost of modern warfare.[^7] This experience reinforced his commitment to peace and reconciliation, themes that would characterize his later papal ministry. After the war, he returned to his teaching position at the seminary in Bergamo, where he also directed the Students' Hostel, demonstrating his pastoral concern for young people's education and welfare.[^8]

## Rise to Power

Roncalli's career in the Vatican diplomatic service began in 1925 when Pope Pius XI appointed him Apostolic Visitor to Bulgaria, elevating him to bishop (Archbishop of Areopolis) at age 43.[^9] This assignment to the Balkans, far from the centers of ecclesiastical power, might have seemed a career dead-end, but Roncalli embraced it with characteristic enthusiasm. In Bulgaria, a predominantly Orthodox country with a tiny Catholic minority, he worked to improve relations between Catholics and Orthodox Christians, demonstrating the ecumenical spirit that would define his papacy.[^10]

In 1934, Roncalli was transferred to Turkey and Greece as Apostolic Delegate, another challenging post in predominantly non-Catholic regions.[^11] During his decade in Turkey (1934-1944), which coincided with World War II, Archbishop Roncalli performed remarkable humanitarian work, helping thousands of Jewish refugees escape Nazi persecution by providing them with transit visas and baptismal certificates.[^12] He worked closely with the Jewish underground and the International Red Cross, actions that demonstrated both moral courage and diplomatic skill. His efforts saved an estimated 24,000 Jewish lives, though he characteristically sought no recognition for these actions.[^13]

In 1944, Pope Pius XII appointed Roncalli as Papal Nuncio to France, one of the Church's most important diplomatic posts.[^14] Postwar France presented enormous challenges, including political divisions between Vichy collaborators and the Resistance, and tensions between the Church and secular forces. Roncalli successfully navigated these treacherous waters, rebuilding the Church's standing in French society while maintaining diplomatic neutrality.[^15] He was elevated to Cardinal in 1953 and appointed Patriarch of Venice, finally receiving a pastoral assignment in Italy after nearly three decades abroad.[^16]

As Patriarch of Venice from 1953 to 1958, Cardinal Roncalli gained a reputation as a compassionate pastor who regularly visited parishes, prisons, and hospitals throughout his diocese.[^17] He engaged with workers, artists, and intellectuals, including socialists and communists, demonstrating an openness to dialogue that was unusual for Church leaders of that era. When Pope Pius XII died in October 1958, the College of Cardinals was deeply divided between conservatives and progressives. After eleven ballots, they elected the 76-year-old Roncalli on October 28, 1958, apparently as a compromise "transitional pope" who would maintain stability without initiating major changes.[^18] The cardinals could not have been more mistaken about what would follow.

## Major Achievements

Pope John XXIII's most significant and enduring achievement was convening the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), the first ecumenical council in nearly a century and one of the most important events in modern Catholic history.[^19] Announced just three months after his election in January 1959, the decision shocked the Catholic world and the Vatican Curia, who had not anticipated such a bold initiative from an elderly pope.[^20] John XXIII conceived the council as an "aggiornamento" (updating) that would open the windows of the Church to let in fresh air, adapting Catholic teaching and practice to the modern world without abandoning essential doctrine.[^21]

The Second Vatican Council, which opened on October 11, 1962, brought together over 2,500 bishops from around the world, along with observers from other Christian denominations—an unprecedented inclusion.[^22] Although John XXIII died before the council's completion in 1965, his vision shaped its revolutionary outcomes: the Mass could be celebrated in local languages rather than exclusively in Latin; the Church recognized religious freedom and the legitimacy of other Christian denominations; greater emphasis was placed on Scripture and the role of laypeople; and the Church committed to dialogue with the modern world rather than condemnation.[^23] These changes fundamentally transformed Catholic worship and the Church's relationship with contemporary society.

In the realm of international diplomacy and peace advocacy, Pope John XXIII made crucial interventions during the Cold War's most dangerous moments. During the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, when the world teetered on the brink of nuclear war, John XXIII issued public appeals for peace and engaged in behind-the-scenes diplomacy with both U.S. President Kennedy and Soviet Premier Khrushchev.[^24] Both leaders later credited the Pope's intervention with helping to create the diplomatic space necessary for a peaceful resolution. His commitment to peace and dialogue across ideological divides earned him respect far beyond Catholic circles.

John XXIII's 1963 encyclical "Pacem in Terris" (Peace on Earth) represented a groundbreaking contribution to Catholic social teaching and international relations.[^25] Addressed not only to Catholics but "to all men of good will," the encyclical affirmed human rights, condemned the arms race, advocated for international cooperation through organizations like the United Nations, and called for dialogue even with communist governments—positions that were controversial among conservative Catholics but prescient in their vision.[^26] The encyclical's emphasis on human dignity, religious freedom, and workers' rights expanded the Church's social justice tradition and influenced human rights discourse globally.

His ecumenical initiatives opened unprecedented dialogue with other Christian denominations and world religions. John XXIII established the Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity in 1960 and invited observers from Orthodox, Protestant, and Anglican churches to Vatican II—the first time in centuries that non-Catholic Christians participated in a Catholic council.[^27] He revised Catholic prayers that contained anti-Semitic language, received Jewish groups in warm audiences (including a historic meeting with the French Jewish historian Jules Isaac that influenced the council's declaration on Jewish-Catholic relations), and began the process of Catholic-Jewish reconciliation after centuries of hostility.[^28] When a group of American Jews visited him, he greeted them with the words, "I am Joseph, your brother," a reference to the biblical Joseph that moved many to tears and symbolized a new era in interfaith relations.[^29]

John XXIII issued eight encyclicals during his brief papacy, several of which addressed pressing social and economic issues. "Mater et Magistra" (Mother and Teacher, 1961) updated Catholic social teaching on labor rights, economic development, and the gap between wealthy and poor nations, advocating for a more equitable international economic order.[^30] These documents demonstrated his concern for social justice and his belief that the Church must actively engage with contemporary economic and political challenges rather than retreating into purely spiritual matters.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his widespread popularity, Pope John XXIII faced significant opposition from conservative Catholics who viewed his reforms as dangerous departures from tradition. Many members of the Roman Curia, the Vatican's administrative apparatus, resisted the Second Vatican Council from its inception, seeing it as unnecessary and potentially destabilizing to Church doctrine and authority.[^31] Cardinal Alfredo Ottaviani, head of the Holy Office (the successor to the Inquisition), led conservative opposition to the council's progressive directions, particularly regarding liturgical changes, religious freedom, and ecumenism.[^32] These conservatives feared that "aggiornamento" would lead to doctrinal relativism and the erosion of Catholic identity.

Traditional Catholics criticized the vernacular Mass and other liturgical reforms that emerged from Vatican II as a betrayal of sacred tradition. The replacement of Latin with local languages, the repositioning of altars to face the congregation, and the reduction of elaborate ceremonies were seen by traditionalists as diminishing the mystery and transcendence of Catholic worship.[^33] Some critics accused John XXIII of enabling a "protestantization" of Catholic liturgy that undermined the unique character of Catholic worship. These debates intensified after his death and continue among traditionalist Catholic groups today, some of whom reject Vatican II entirely and view John XXIII as having initiated the Church's decline.[^34]

John XXIII's diplomatic opening toward communist governments drew harsh criticism from anti-communist Catholics, particularly in the United States and among Catholic refugees from Eastern Europe.[^35] His "Ostpolitik" (Eastern policy), which sought dialogue with Soviet bloc countries rather than confrontation, was seen by critics as naive appeasement of atheistic regimes that persecuted Christians. The 1963 audience granted to Alexei Adzhubei, editor of the Soviet newspaper Izvestia and son-in-law of Nikita Khrushchev, particularly scandalized conservative Catholics who viewed any engagement with communist leaders as collaboration with evil.[^36] Critics argued that this approach betrayed Catholics suffering under communist persecution in countries like Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia.

Some scholars and Church historians have argued that John XXIII, despite his good intentions, lacked the administrative skills and theological rigor necessary for the office of Pope. His decision to convene Vatican II without adequate preparation or clear objectives, critics contend, led to confusion and conflict during the council sessions and contributed to the polarization that has plagued the Church since the 1960s.[^37] Conservative commentators have suggested that John XXIII's optimistic view of the modern world was naive and that the council's openness to contemporary culture contributed to declining Church attendance, priestly vocations, and religious practice in the decades following Vatican II.[^38]

John XXIII's wartime record, while generally heroic in his rescue of Jews, has been scrutinized for what he did not say publicly about the Holocaust. Although he worked behind the scenes to save Jewish lives, he did not publicly denounce Nazi atrocities in the way some critics believe he should have, similar to criticisms leveled at Pope Pius XII.[^39] Some historians argue that both as a diplomat and as Pope, Roncalli prioritized quiet diplomacy over public moral witness, a choice that raises questions about the Church's response to the greatest moral crisis of the twentieth century.

His relatively brief papacy of less than five years meant that many of his initiatives remained incomplete and subject to varying interpretations. John XXIII did not live to see the conclusion of Vatican II or to guide its implementation, leaving the council's legacy contested.[^40] Critics argue that his failure to provide clear direction for implementing reforms contributed to the "spirit of Vatican II" becoming a catchphrase for changes he never intended, while others contend he deliberately left the council open-ended to allow the Church to evolve organically.

## Personal Life

Angelo Roncalli maintained close ties to his large peasant family throughout his life, regularly returning to visit relatives in Sotto il Monte despite his rising ecclesiastical status.[^41] He corresponded frequently with family members and often spoke affectionately of his humble origins, never attempting to hide or aristocratize his background as some clerics did. When he became Pope, he invited his siblings to the Vatican, where they arrived in simple country clothes, prompting some Vatican officials to suggest they be better dressed for papal audiences—a suggestion John XXIII firmly rejected.[^42] His genuine humility and lack of pretension were evident in these family relationships.

Known for his warmth, humor, and accessibility, John XXIII possessed a personality that contrasted sharply with the remote, aristocratic bearing of many previous popes. He was famous for his spontaneous visits around Rome, dropping in unexpectedly at parishes, hospitals, and even a prison on Christmas Day 1958, the first pope to visit a prison in modern times.[^43] These unscheduled pastoral visits, which caused consternation among his security detail and Vatican protocol officers, demonstrated his pastoral heart and his desire to make the papacy more approachable and human.

Pope John XXIII was noted for his considerable girth and jolly demeanor, which contributed to his grandfatherly image. He possessed a self-deprecating wit and often made jokes about his appearance and age. When asked how many people worked in the Vatican, he reportedly replied, "About half of them."[^44] Upon being asked how many people lived in Rome, he quipped, "All of them, I hope—I wouldn't want anyone just half-alive." This humor and earthiness made him accessible to ordinary people and helped bridge the distance between the papacy and the laity.

His personal spirituality was characterized by simplicity, devotion to prayer, and Marian piety typical of his Italian peasant background. John XXIII maintained a daily routine of prayer, meditation, and the rosary throughout his life.[^45] His personal diary, published posthumously as "Journal of a Soul," reveals a man of deep faith who struggled with pride and self-doubt, regularly examining his conscience and seeking spiritual improvement.[^46] The journal shows his evolution from a young seminarian to an elderly pope, providing intimate insights into his inner life and spiritual development.

Pope John XXIII lived modestly by Vatican standards, maintaining simple tastes in food and furnishings despite the opulence surrounding him. He preferred simple Italian cuisine reminiscent of his childhood and was known to invite unexpected guests to share meals, breaking with the formal protocols that typically governed papal life.[^47] His servants and aides consistently described him as considerate, kind, and appreciative of their work—treating them as fellow human beings rather than as mere functionaries.

His health declined significantly during the final year of his papacy. In late 1962, he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, but he kept his condition largely private and continued his work.[^48] As his illness progressed, he maintained his duties and saw the opening sessions of Vatican II, determined to launch the council even as his strength failed. He died on June 3, 1963, after several months of painful illness borne with patience and dignity, surrounded by prayers from Catholics and non-Catholics worldwide.[^49]

## Legacy

Pope John XXIII's legacy is inextricably linked to the Second Vatican Council, which fundamentally reshaped Catholic worship, theology, and the Church's relationship with the modern world. The council's reforms—including the vernacular Mass, emphasis on collegiality among bishops, affirmation of religious freedom, and commitment to ecumenical dialogue—remain the defining features of contemporary Catholicism for the majority of Catholics worldwide.[^50] Even decades after his death, debates about Vatican II and its proper interpretation continue to define fault lines within the Catholic Church, with progressives and conservatives both claiming to represent John XXIII's true intentions.

His model of papal leadership—pastoral, accessible, and oriented toward dialogue rather than condemnation—influenced his successors and changed expectations of what a pope should be. Pope Francis, elected in 2013, has frequently been compared to John XXIII for his similar emphasis on mercy, simplicity, and engagement with the poor and marginalized.[^51] The shift from a monarchical, distant papacy to a more pastoral, visible one owes much to John XXIII's example, though this transformation has been uneven across subsequent pontificates.

In the realm of interfaith relations, John XXIII's openness created lasting institutional changes that have made Catholic-Jewish dialogue, ecumenical cooperation with other Christian denominations, and engagement with other world religions normal rather than exceptional.[^52] The Vatican II document "Nostra Aetate," which repudiated the charge of deicide against Jews and affirmed respect for other religions, emerged from his vision and has fundamentally altered Catholic approaches to interfaith relations. Jewish leaders worldwide recognize him as having begun the process of healing centuries of Christian anti-Semitism.

John XXIII's social teaching, particularly "Pacem in Terris," influenced not only Catholic social thought but also international human rights discourse more broadly. The encyclical's emphasis on human dignity, universal rights, and international cooperation was cited by secular human rights advocates and helped establish common ground between religious and secular approaches to peace and justice.[^53] His advocacy for workers' rights, economic justice, and concern for developing nations expanded the Church's social justice tradition and continues to inform Catholic engagement with economic and political issues.

The process of his canonization reflects his enduring impact and popular devotion. John XXIII was beatified by Pope John Paul II in 2000 and canonized as a saint by Pope Francis on April 27, 2014, alongside Pope John Paul II.[^54] Significantly, Pope Francis waived the usual requirement of a second miracle for John XXIII's canonization (beyond the one required for beatification), citing "popular devotion" and the Pope's clear holiness—an unusual decision that reflected Francis's desire to honor the reforming pope and to signal continuity with Vatican II.[^55] His feast day is celebrated on October 11, the anniversary of the opening of Vatican II.

Sotto il Monte, his birthplace, was renamed "Sotto il Monte Giovanni XXIII" in his honor and has become a pilgrimage site where visitors come to see his family home and the church where he was baptized.[^56] The simple peasant house where he was born stands as a testament to his humble origins and his journey from poverty to the papacy, inspiring many with the message that sanctity and greatness can emerge from the most ordinary circumstances.

His phrase "opening the windows of the Church" has become proverbial, capturing his vision of a Church engaged with rather than withdrawn from the modern world. This image of ventilation and renewal continues to resonate with Catholics seeking reform and adaptation, though it equally provokes anxiety among those who fear such openness leads to the loss of traditional identity and truth.[^57] The tension between these visions ensures that John XXIII's legacy remains dynamically contested rather than settled.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and Church leaders who view John XXIII positively emphasize his prophetic vision in recognizing that the Catholic Church needed fundamental renewal to remain relevant in the modern world. Theologian Hans Küng, while often critical of the institutional Church, praised John XXIII as "a man sent by God at the right time" who had the courage to challenge centuries of Catholic insularity and triumphalism.[^58] Küng and other progressive theologians argue that Vatican II represented the Church's necessary engagement with modernity, pluralism, and human rights—values that John XXIII courageously embraced despite opposition from powerful forces within the Vatican.

Pope Francis has repeatedly invoked John XXIII as a model of papal ministry, praising his pastoral approach, his mercy, and his willingness to listen to the signs of the times.[^59] By canonizing him and frequently citing his example, Francis has signaled that John XXIII's vision of a poor Church for the poor, a merciful Church rather than a judgmental one, and a Church in dialogue with the world represents an authentic and necessary path for contemporary Catholicism. This papal endorsement has reinforced John XXIII's stature among Catholics who support ongoing reform and adaptation.

Historians of the Catholic Church, including John O'Malley and Massimo Faggioli, have documented how Vatican II unleashed creative energies within Catholicism that produced the liturgical renewal, increased lay participation, and global perspectives that characterize the contemporary Church at its best.[^60] They argue that John XXIII's emphasis on collegiality—the shared responsibility of bishops rather than papal autocracy—provided a healthier ecclesiology that has strengthened the Church even when imperfectly implemented. O'Malley's scholarship demonstrates that John XXIII successfully connected with ancient Catholic traditions of adaptation and inculturation while breaking with the rigid defensive posture the Church had maintained since the Protestant Reformation.

Ecumenical leaders from other Christian traditions have consistently praised John XXIII for initiating genuine dialogue and partnership. The World Council of Churches and numerous Protestant denominations view his invitation of observers to Vatican II as a watershed moment that made subsequent ecumenical cooperation possible.[^61] Orthodox Christian leaders, while maintaining theological disagreements with Rome, acknowledge that John XXIII began a process of healing the thousand-year schism between Eastern and Western Christianity through his genuine respect and outreach.

Jewish historians and religious leaders regard John XXIII as a righteous gentile whose rescue efforts during the Holocaust and subsequent work to eliminate anti-Semitism from Catholic teaching merit profound gratitude.[^62] The Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Israel has recognized his wartime humanitarian work, and Jewish scholars like David Kertzer have documented how his papacy marked a fundamental turning point in Catholic-Jewish relations after centuries of hostility. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, who met with John XXIII, called him "a man of exquisite piety" whose humility and love transcended religious boundaries.[^63]

Biographers such as Peter Hebblethwaite and Thomas Cahill have portrayed John XXIII as a providential figure—a man whose combination of deep traditional faith, pastoral experience, diplomatic skill, and personal warmth made him uniquely suited to guide the Church through a critical transition.[^64] Cahill's biography emphasizes John XXIII's emotional intelligence and his ability to read historical moments, arguing that his peasant background gave him both rootedness in traditional faith and empathy for ordinary people's struggles, making him wiser than more educated but insulated Church leaders.

## Negative Views

Traditionalist Catholics and conservative Church historians view John XXIII's legacy far more critically, seeing him as the initiator of a catastrophic break with Catholic tradition that has led to doctrinal confusion, liturgical banality, and the loss of Catholic identity. Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X, which rejects Vatican II, blamed John XXIII for opening the door to modernism and liberalism that he believed corrupted the Church.[^65] Lefebvre and his followers maintain that the vernacular Mass, ecumenism, and religious freedom represent departures from perennial Catholic teaching that have produced the crisis of faith evident in declining Mass attendance and vocations.

Conservative Catholic intellectuals like Roberto de Mattei have argued that John XXIII's optimism about the modern world was naive and that Vatican II's engagement with modernity led the Church to compromise essential truths.[^66] De Mattei and similar scholars contend that the council's documents contained ambiguities that progressive theologians exploited to introduce practices and teachings incompatible with Catholic tradition. They argue that John XXIII, by failing to provide clear theological guardrails for the council, bears responsibility for subsequent deviations and confusion.

Some Church historians have questioned whether John XXIII possessed the intellectual depth and theological sophistication required for the transformative project he initiated. Unlike his successor Paul VI, who was a trained theologian and experienced administrator, John XXIII was primarily a pastor and diplomat whose understanding of complex theological issues may have been limited.[^67] Critics suggest that his failure to clearly define the council's objectives or to anticipate resistance from conservatives reflected a lack of strategic thinking that compromised the reforms he sought.

Scholars critical of Vatican II's implementation, such as Alcuin Reid and Matthew Levering, argue that the liturgical reforms that John XXIII set in motion resulted in the loss of sacred beauty, transcendence, and reverence in Catholic worship.[^68] They contend that the "noble simplicity" called for by the council became barren minimalism in practice, with contemporary Catholic liturgy often lacking the aesthetic richness and theological depth of traditional forms. While acknowledging John XXIII's good intentions, these scholars believe the vernacular Mass and simplified rites have impoverished Catholic worship rather than enriching it.

Cold War historians and anti-communist activists have criticized John XXIII's "Ostpolitik" as a betrayal of Catholics suffering under communist regimes. George Weigel and other scholars have argued that the Vatican's diplomatic engagement with communist governments, begun under John XXIII and continued by his successors, amounted to appeasement that legitimized oppressive regimes and undermined Catholic resistance movements in Eastern Europe.[^69] They point out that Cardinal József Mindszenty of Hungary and other imprisoned bishops opposed Vatican negotiations with their communist persecutors, seeing such diplomacy as abandoning them to their fate.

Some critics within the Catholic Church have suggested that John XXIII's papacy, while personally admirable, unleashed forces he did not understand and could not control. The "crisis of authority" that emerged in the 1960s, with Catholics increasingly questioning Church teaching on contraception, sexual ethics, and other matters, is seen by these critics as traceable to the questioning spirit John XXIII encouraged without providing adequate limits.[^70] They argue that by emphasizing the need for change, he inadvertently suggested that all Church teaching was open to revision, undermining the notion of unchanging truth that had anchored Catholic identity.

Feminist theologians and progressive critics from a different perspective have argued that John XXIII's reforms, while important, did not go far enough and left intact patriarchal structures that exclude women from Church leadership and decision-making.[^71] They note that Vatican II, for all its innovations, maintained the all-male priesthood and episcopate and did not seriously consider women's roles in the Church. From this perspective, John XXIII's reformist vision remained limited by the traditional assumptions of his era and required further development by subsequent generations.

## Famous Quotes

> "Consult not your fears but your hopes and your dreams. Think not about your frustrations, but about your unfulfilled potential. Concern yourself not with what you tried and failed in, but with what it is still possible for you to do."

This quote, from his opening address to the Second Vatican Council, encapsulates John XXIII's optimistic spirit and forward-looking vision for the Church, encouraging Catholics to embrace possibility rather than dwelling on past failures or present fears.[^72]

> "I am Joseph, your brother."

These words, spoken in Hebrew to a delegation of American Jews visiting the Vatican in 1960, referenced the biblical Joseph and represented a profound moment of reconciliation between Catholics and Jews, signaling the Pope's desire to heal centuries of Christian anti-Semitism.[^73]

> "We were all made by the same hand, and we have the same father. That's all that counts."

This statement reflects John XXIII's universal vision of human brotherhood and dignity that transcended religious, national, and ideological divisions—a vision that informed his ecumenical and peace initiatives.[^74]

> "See everything, overlook a great deal, correct a little."

This motto, which John XXIII adopted for his pastoral ministry, reveals his practical wisdom and pastoral approach—understanding human frailty, choosing battles carefully, and prioritizing mercy over rigid enforcement of rules.[^75]

> "The Church is not a museum to house a collection of priceless antiques. It is a garden in which things should grow."

This metaphor captures John XXIII's conviction that the Church must develop and adapt to new circumstances rather than merely preserving the past, though he believed such growth must remain rooted in authentic tradition.[^76]
