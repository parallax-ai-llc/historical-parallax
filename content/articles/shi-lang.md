## Summary

Shi Lang (施琅, March 7, 1621 – April 22, 1696) was a Chinese admiral who served under both the Ming and Qing dynasties during the tumultuous 17th century. Originally a trusted naval commander under the Ming loyalist Zheng family, he defected to the invading Qing dynasty in 1646 following a bitter personal dispute with Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), who subsequently executed Shi's father, brother, and son in brutal retaliation.[^1][^2] Shi Lang is most renowned for leading the Qing conquest of the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan in 1683, decisively defeating the Zheng forces at the Battle of Penghu and subsequently persuading the Kangxi Emperor to formally annex Taiwan as a prefecture of Fujian province.[^3][^4] His legacy remains deeply controversial, celebrated in mainland China as a unifying hero while denounced in Taiwan as a traitorous conqueror and exploitative governor.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Shi Lang was born on March 7, 1621, to a distinguished lineage in Jinjiang, Fujian province, during the late Ming dynasty.[^6][^7] His family background afforded him certain privileges and connections that would prove instrumental in his military career. From youth, Shi displayed marked self-confidence and studied military strategy extensively, becoming particularly proficient in naval warfare—a specialization that reflected Fujian's strong seafaring traditions and maritime culture.[^8][^9] He developed expertise in the tactical use of wind and tidal currents, skills honed in Fujian's coastal environment that would later distinguish him as one of the era's foremost naval commanders.[^10]

After fighting minor operations locally with his father, Shi Lang joined the naval fleet of Zheng Zhilong, a powerful maritime warlord who controlled much of the southeastern Chinese coast.[^11] Zheng Zhilong was the first leader to recognize Shi Lang's exceptional proficiency in naval operations, appointing him as captain of the navy's left vanguard in 1640 and gradually promoting him to ever-higher ranks.[^12][^13] Shi Lang was also famous for his physical strength, ferocity in battle, and superior martial skills, which earned him respect among his peers and superiors alike.[^14] His rise through the ranks of the Zheng fleet appeared destined for continued success, as he served as a trusted subordinate in one of the most formidable private naval forces in East Asia during this period.[^15]

However, Shi Lang's relationship with Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), the son of Zheng Zhilong, proved increasingly problematic. Shi Lang had accurately predicted vulnerabilities in Koxinga's military strategies during campaigns in Xiamen and elsewhere, and therefore grew increasingly arrogant, often openly questioning Koxinga's military tactics.[^16] The Kangxi Emperor would later describe Shi Lang as a fierce warrior highly adept in military command skills, but also as a blunt and rude person who lacked basic manners and courtesy—character traits that exacerbated his conflicts with the temperamental Koxinga.[^17] In late 1651, no longer able to bear Shi Lang's arrogance and temperament, Koxinga imprisoned him on a boat, along with his father and younger brother, marking the beginning of the end of their relationship.[^18]

---

## Rise to Power

The bitter personal conflict between Shi Lang and Zheng Chenggong intensified due to Koxinga's jealousy surrounding Shi Lang's close relationship with Zheng Zhilong, creating an untenable situation within the Ming loyalist command structure.[^19] By the mid-1640s, as the Qing conquest of China accelerated and the Ming dynasty crumbled, Shi Lang made the fateful decision to defect to the Manchu Qing forces in 1646.[^20] This defection was not simply a strategic calculation but was precipitated by the deteriorating personal relationship with Koxinga and the recognition that the Ming cause appeared increasingly hopeless.[^21]

Koxinga's response to Shi Lang's betrayal was swift and brutal. When Shi defected to the Qing dynasty, Zheng Chenggong killed Shi's father, son, younger brother, and nephew in retaliation—a devastating act that transformed Shi Lang's defection from a political maneuver into a deeply personal vendetta.[^22][^23] This family tragedy ultimately intensified Shi Lang's commitment to the Qing cause, in which he sought to inflict immense harm to eliminate the Ming loyalist resistance and avenge the murders of his family members.[^24] The Qing rulers immediately recognized Shi Lang's value, prizing him for his extensive naval experience and his network of contacts in the major trading ports of East Asia.[^25]

Shi Lang accompanied Prince Jidu (son of Jirgalang) on military expeditions in Fujian in 1656, demonstrating his loyalty to his new masters and attaining the rank of Assistant Brigadier-General.[^26] Throughout the 1660s, he served as commander-in-chief of the Qing fleets that systematically destroyed the power of Zheng Chenggong's descendants, participating in numerous naval engagements that gradually eroded the Zheng family's maritime dominance.[^27][^28] His tactical emphasis on blockading ports and disrupting the Zheng's amphibious reinforcements proved pivotal, as documented in Qing military records emphasizing the navy's role in preventing counterattacks.[^29]

In 1681, following the suppression of the Revolt of the Three Feudatories, the Kangxi Emperor sought a capable leader for an amphibious operation against the Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan, the last remaining bastion of Ming loyalist resistance. Following the advice of his trusted advisor Li Guangdi, the emperor chose Shi Lang for this critical mission.[^30] Shi Lang insisted on having an independent command, not one shared with Yao Qisheng, the Governor-General of Fujian—a remarkable concession given that Shi was a defector from the Zheng fleet, not an ethnic Manchu, and had experienced a humiliating defeat on a previous expedition to Taiwan.[^31] This appointment demonstrated the Kangxi Emperor's confidence in Shi Lang's unique qualifications for the Taiwan campaign and marked the culmination of his rise from disgraced defector to the empire's most trusted naval commander.

## Major Achievements

Shi Lang's greatest military achievement was the conquest of Taiwan in 1683, a campaign that would permanently alter the geopolitical landscape of East Asia and secure his place in history. After extensive preparation throughout 1682 and early 1683, Shi Lang led a massive force of 300 warships and 20,000 soldiers out of Tongshan, Fujian on July 8, 1683.[^32][^33] The key to his strategy was first neutralizing the Penghu Islands (Pescadores), which served as the defensive outpost protecting Taiwan from mainland invasion.

The decisive Battle of Penghu took place on July 16-17, 1683, pitting Shi Lang's Qing forces against the Zheng family's leading naval commander, Liu Guoxuan.[^34][^35] Shi Lang employed sophisticated tactical innovations that demonstrated his mastery of naval warfare. He divided his force into several smaller fleets rather than maintaining a single massed line, drawing on his prior experience against Zheng forces to create multiple smaller, more agile flotillas that enabled concentrated attacks on isolated segments of the enemy while minimizing exposure to counterattacks.[^36] A small detachment was sent to flank the main battle and land directly on the island where Liu's base was located, though Liu had anticipated this maneuver and positioned archers and cannons on the beaches to repel the landing.[^37]

Shi Lang's forces possessed crucial advantages in firepower and equipment. A few days before the battle, he had purchased superior cannons from the Dutch, ensuring his ships would be better armed than the Zheng vessels.[^38] The Qing fleet was larger, better armed, and had more ammunition than their opponents, with the numerical edge effectively outnumbering the defenders roughly three to one in deployable combat power.[^39] Bolstered by these Dutch-supplied guns, the Qing navy sank 169 Zheng junks with a loss of twelve thousand Ming naval personnel, effectively destroying Zheng naval superiority in a single engagement.[^40] As the battle at sea raged, Qing soldiers rushed ashore under the cover of cannon fire, establishing beachheads on Penghu.[^41] Most of the Tungning ships sank within an hour of the main engagement, resulting in a catastrophic defeat for the Ming loyalists.[^42]

On September 5, 1683, Shi Lang received Zheng Keshuang's offer to surrender, and on October 3, he reached Taiwan and formally obtained the capitulation of Liu Guoxuan and Zheng Keshuang, ending the 22-year existence of the Kingdom of Tungning.[^43][^44] This military victory was remarkable not only for its decisive nature but also for the relatively limited Qing casualties compared to the devastating losses inflicted on the Zheng forces—a testament to Shi Lang's tactical superiority and thorough preparation.

Following this successful campaign, Shi Lang undertook perhaps his most significant political achievement: persuading the Kangxi Emperor to formally annex Taiwan rather than abandon it. Initially, the Kangxi Emperor regarded Taiwan as "a ball of mud beyond the pale of civilization" that did not appear on any map of the imperial domain until 1683.[^45] The emperor rejected proposals to annex the island twice, viewing it as a remote and economically marginal territory not worth the administrative burden.[^46] However, Shi Lang's stay in Taiwan convinced him that annexing the island was of far greater importance than initially expected, particularly due to its economic potential and strategic value.[^47]

On February 7, 1684, Shi submitted a comprehensive memorial to Kangxi with detailed arguments for keeping Taiwan, including descriptions of the island's economic products, the cost of relocating Taiwan's inhabitants, strategic assessments, and a map of its geography.[^48][^49] Among Shi's arguments, the one that likely struck Kangxi most forcefully was strategic: "Taiwan, though made up of multiple islands, in fact commands key strategic points across four provinces"—namely Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu.[^50] Shi vehemently argued that to abandon Taiwan would leave it open to occupation by criminals, adventurers, and potentially the Dutch, who had previously colonized parts of the island.[^51] He assured the emperor that defending Taiwan would not be exorbitant and would only require 10,000 men, while garrisoned forces on the South China coast could actually be reduced.[^52]

Strategic anxieties finally persuaded the young emperor to incorporate Taiwan into the Qing imperial order.[^53] On March 6, 1684, Kangxi accepted Shi's proposal to set up permanent military establishments in Penghu and Taiwan.[^54] The final recommendation for annexing Taiwan was formally accepted, and the emperor authorized the establishment of Taiwan Prefecture as a new prefecture of Fujian Province in April 1684, divided into three counties: Taiwan, Zhuluo, and Fengshan.[^55][^56] This decision, heavily influenced by Shi Lang's advocacy, ensured that Taiwan would remain part of China's recognized territory for the next two centuries and beyond, fundamentally shaping the island's historical trajectory.

For his accomplishments, Shi Lang received extraordinary honors. He was declared the "General Who Maintains Peace on the Seas" (靖海将军) and given the hereditary rank of Marquis, with the title Marquis Jinghai (Marquis of Sea-Pacification) awarded on October 7, 1683.[^57][^58] At his own request, he was specially granted the privilege of wearing an honorary peacock feather, a prestigious symbol of imperial favor typically reserved for the highest-ranking officials.[^59] In 1688, the Kangxi Emperor received Shi Lang in audience in Beijing and allowed him to sit in the imperial presence, reiterating his confidence in him—an exceptional honor that demonstrated Shi Lang's elevated status in the Qing hierarchy.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his military achievements and official honors, Shi Lang remains one of the most controversial figures in Chinese history, subject to sustained criticism from multiple perspectives. The most fundamental criticism centers on his defection from the Ming loyalist cause to serve the Manchu Qing dynasty. He is generally denounced as a traitorous figure who abandoned the Ming loyalist resistance against the Manchu invaders, betraying both his former commander Zheng Chenggong and the broader Chinese nationalist cause.[^61][^62] Throughout Chinese history, he has been tainted with derogatory labels such as *hangjian* (traitor to the Han Chinese), *zougou* (running dog), *minzu zuiren* (criminal against the nation), and *erchen* (disloyal minister)—terms that reflect the deep moral condemnation directed at those who switched allegiances during dynastic transitions.[^63]

Critics including Yang Qinhua and Xu Xiaowang accused Shi Lang of feigning loyalty to the Zhengs, betraying the Ming court, and subsequently sponging off the Taiwanese people after the conquest.[^64] His reputation was particularly damaged during periods when Chinese nationalism emphasized ethnic Han resistance to Manchu rule, making his service to the Qing dynasty appear especially reprehensible. As a defector, his exploits were generally downplayed by the governments of both Taiwan and China for extended periods, with many preferring to minimize his historical role rather than celebrate a figure whose career embodied collaboration with foreign conquerors.[^65]

Shi Lang's governance of Taiwan after the 1683 conquest generated severe criticisms of corruption, exploitation, and deliberate mismanagement. After conquering Taiwan, Shi Lang seized almost half of the developed land in southern Taiwan for his own profit, becoming one of the largest landowners on the island—a massive land grab that enriched him personally while dispossessing local communities.[^66][^67] While his push to have Taiwan annexed may have had strategic merit, it was not entirely for the sake of the state, as he had already begun to accumulate substantial private holdings before the formal annexation decision.[^68]

Beyond land seizures, Shi annually extorted monetary resources from both rich and poor local communities alike, creating a system of extraction that drained Taiwan's economy for his personal benefit.[^69] He instituted policies that deliberately aimed to isolate Taiwan from the rest of the Qing Empire, including forbidding coastal provinces to interact with Taiwan and disallowing people from inland provinces to bring their families to the island.[^70][^71] These isolation policies appeared designed to maintain Taiwan as a personal fiefdom where he could operate with minimal oversight from Beijing, maximizing his opportunities for exploitation while preventing the integration that might have brought greater imperial scrutiny.

From a Taiwanese local perspective, Shi Lang is remembered as an incompetent, imperious minister who caused a series of difficulties for the land.[^72] In Taiwan, he is remembered as a conqueror and cruel governor whose primary legacy was exploitation rather than benevolent administration.[^73] The combination of military conquest, land seizure, systematic extortion, and deliberate isolation created deep resentment among Taiwan's population that persisted long after his death. His governance stood in marked contrast to the more development-oriented policies that other Qing officials would later implement, suggesting that his primary interest was personal enrichment rather than effective administration or the welfare of the island's inhabitants.

## Personal Life

Shi Lang's personal life was profoundly shaped by tragedy and marked by complex family dynamics. The brutal execution of his father, son, younger brother, and nephew by Zheng Chenggong in 1646 created a trauma that defined much of his subsequent life and motivated his relentless pursuit of the Zheng family's destruction.[^74] This family massacre transformed what might have been a pragmatic defection during a period of dynastic transition into a consuming personal vendetta that drove Shi Lang for nearly four decades.

Despite these devastating losses, Shi Lang's family line continued and even prospered under Qing rule. One of his sons achieved distinction as an admiral, following in his father's naval tradition, while another became a state official, demonstrating the family's successful integration into the Qing bureaucratic system.[^75] The Shi family was granted the special privilege of burial in their ancestral cemetery in Jinjiang, Fujian, instead of in Banner lands as was customary for other Bannermen—a mark of exceptional imperial favor that acknowledged both Shi Lang's service and his distinguished lineage.[^76] His tomb is located in Quanzhou, Fujian, where it remains as a physical testament to his historical significance.[^77]

The Kangxi Emperor's personal assessment of Shi Lang reveals much about his character and personality. The emperor described him as a fierce warrior who was highly adept in military command skills, praising his tactical acumen and battlefield prowess.[^78] However, Kangxi also noted that Shi Lang was a blunt and rude person who lacked basic manners and courtesy—character flaws that apparently did not diminish the emperor's appreciation of his military value but did shape their interpersonal relationship.[^79] This bluntness and lack of diplomatic grace had earlier contributed to Shi Lang's conflicts with Zheng Chenggong, whose pride could not tolerate Shi Lang's open criticism of his military decisions.[^80]

Shi Lang's personality combined remarkable self-confidence with an arrogant temperament that often created friction with superiors and peers. His accurate predictions of military vulnerabilities, particularly regarding Xiamen's defenses during campaigns under Koxinga, were tactically sound but delivered with such arrogance that they antagonized his commander.[^81] He was famous not only for his naval expertise but also for his physical strength, ferocity in battle, and superior martial skills—qualities that made him formidable in combat but also contributed to an intimidating and abrasive personal presence.[^82] These personality traits proved advantageous in military contexts where decisiveness and confidence were essential, but created significant interpersonal challenges that ultimately led to his break with the Zheng family and his imprisonment in 1651.[^83]

## Legacy

Shi Lang's legacy is extraordinarily complex and contested, with his historical reputation undergoing dramatic transformations across different time periods and political contexts. For over two centuries, some of China's most prominent officials, literary figures, and intellectuals have paid special attention to his legacy, and he remains essential to understanding cross-strait tensions and contemporary geopolitics between mainland China and Taiwan.[^84][^85] His significance varies dramatically depending on the observer's political perspective, national identity, and historical interpretation, revealing how historical narratives are continually constructed and reconstructed in shifting political contexts.[^86]

In 1732, thirty-six years after his death, Shi Lang's name was entered for worship in the Temple of Eminent Statesmen, a significant honor that recognized his contributions to consolidating Qing rule.[^87] Additionally, Shigong Temple was founded between 1683 and 1696 in the Penghu area to commemorate Shi Lang while he was still alive, after he was conferred as Marquess by the Kangxi Emperor—an unusual honor reflecting the immediate recognition of his achievements.[^88] He was given the posthumous name "Xiangzhuang" (襄壮) and the title of Junior Tutor to the Heir Apparent, ensuring his formal commemoration within the Qing dynastic hierarchy.[^89]

However, Shi Lang's legacy underwent dramatic shifts during the Republican period in the early 20th century. Although he had helped fight off the Manchu before joining the Qing, he was not celebrated during the Republican era precisely because he had been overly idolized during the Qing dynasty and was seen as an unwelcome Qing figure associated with Manchu conquest rather than Chinese nationalism.[^90] The Republican government and intellectuals, many of whom emphasized Han Chinese nationalism and anti-Manchu sentiment, treated Shi Lang unfavorably as a symbol of collaboration with foreign rule.[^91]

During the first few decades of the People's Republic of China, Shi Lang's legacy received minimal attention due to the Communist Party's generally negative view of the Qing dynasty as a feudal and foreign regime.[^92] However, beginning in the 1980s, a remarkable transformation occurred as Shi Lang became viewed as a maritime hero whose primary significance lay in unifying Taiwan with the mainland.[^93] Mainland scholars' assessments focused on Shi Lang's military glory and his success in persuading the Kangxi Emperor to incorporate Taiwan into the empire, with scholars such as Lin Qian and Wang Zhengyao arguing that Shi Lang and the Kangxi Emperor played crucial roles in unifying the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.[^94]

Shi Lang became an exception to the Communists' negative view of the Qing dynasty specifically because he had accomplished "China-Taiwan integration," with the Chinese Communist Party treating his legacy separately under the framework of "unification of China and Taiwan."[^95] Since the 1990s, as cross-strait tensions increased and Taiwan's independence movement gained strength, Shi Lang's legacy was once again recast in an increasingly positive light in mainland China, with official and scholarly publications paying homage to the role he played in incorporating Taiwan into China.[^96] This revival of studies on Shi Lang has opened broader debates among mainland academic circles over who deserves more credit for Taiwan's annexation—Shi Lang or the Kangxi Emperor himself.[^97]

In Taiwan, by contrast, Shi Lang's legacy has remained predominantly negative throughout modern history. The exiled Kuomintang government saw Shi Lang as a convenient scapegoat who defected from the Zhengs and the pro-Ming resistance to serve the Manchu Qing dynasty.[^98] He is remembered in Taiwan as a conqueror and cruel governor whose primary contributions were military conquest and exploitative governance rather than beneficial development.[^99] From the Taiwanese perspective, Shi Lang represents foreign conquest and occupation, making him fundamentally unsuitable for positive commemoration in a political culture that increasingly emphasizes Taiwanese identity and autonomy.

Some Taiwanese scholars have attempted more nuanced assessments. In the early 1990s, historian Zhou Xueyu called for a more objective evaluation of Admiral Shi, arguing that despite his defection from the Zhengs to the Qing, he possessed a more developed political vision for keeping Taiwan in Qing hands, which allowed for Taiwan's integration into a larger political and economic system.[^100] This perspective suggests that Shi Lang's advocacy for annexation, whatever his personal motivations, may have prevented Taiwan from becoming a haven for pirates, adventurers, or recolonization by European powers, potentially creating worse outcomes for the island's inhabitants.

Ultimately, Shi Lang's image continues to mean different things to different communities, with his significance being communicated across political boundaries in mutually reinforcing processes that reflect contemporary concerns more than historical accuracy.[^101] He remains a pivotal figure whose conquest of Taiwan in 1683 fundamentally shaped the island's trajectory, ensuring its incorporation into the Chinese empire and creating the historical foundation for contemporary debates about Taiwan's political status—a legacy that continues to resonate more than three centuries after his death.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders and official Chinese historiography since the 1980s have emphasized Shi Lang's crucial role in incorporating Taiwan into the Chinese empire and preventing the island from falling under foreign control or becoming a base for pirates and criminals. Scholars such as Lin Qian and Wang Zhengyao have argued that Shi Lang and the Kangxi Emperor played instrumental roles in unifying the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, creating the political foundation for Taiwan's development as part of China.[^102] From this perspective, his unwavering determination prevented a difficult annexation project from falling apart, his skill and bravery guaranteed military victory, and his strategic vision assured the final integration of Taiwan into China.[^103]

Academic supporters emphasize that Shi Lang possessed extensive knowledge of Taiwan's strategic value and economic potential, which most Qing officials lacked. His detailed memorial of February 1684 provided the Kangxi Emperor with comprehensive information about Taiwan's geography, resources, and strategic importance, without which the emperor might have abandoned the island to an uncertain fate.[^104] Mainland scholars since the 1990s have praised Shi Lang as a maritime hero whose naval innovations and tactical brilliance enabled the Qing dynasty to project power across the Taiwan Strait, incorporating territories that had previously been beyond effective imperial control.[^105]

Some scholars have also noted that Shi Lang's naval warfare innovations, including his tactical emphasis on blockading ports, disrupting amphibious reinforcements, and incorporating Dutch naval technology into the Qing fleet, represented significant contributions to Chinese maritime military development.[^106][^107] His division of forces into multiple smaller, more agile flotillas rather than maintaining single massed formations demonstrated tactical sophistication that presaged later developments in naval warfare.[^108] His success in the Battle of Penghu, achieved with relatively limited Qing casualties despite the enormous losses inflicted on Zheng forces, exemplified the effectiveness of superior preparation, firepower, and tactical flexibility.[^109]

In the context of 17th-century political realities, some historians have argued that Shi Lang's defection was neither unusual nor particularly reprehensible, given that the Ming dynasty was clearly collapsing and numerous officials switched allegiances during this chaotic transition period. From this perspective, Shi Lang made a pragmatic decision to serve the emerging power rather than persisting in a doomed resistance, and his subsequent service to the Qing brought stability and order to regions that might otherwise have experienced prolonged warfare and suffering.[^110] Contemporary mainland Chinese scholars, particularly those writing within frameworks emphasizing national unity, have celebrated Shi Lang as a unifying figure whose actions brought Taiwan permanently into the Chinese political sphere, creating historical precedents that support current territorial claims.[^111]

### Negative Views

Critics of Shi Lang have consistently emphasized his betrayal of the Ming loyalist cause and his defection to the Manchu invaders, viewing him fundamentally as a traitor who abandoned Chinese resistance to foreign conquest. He has been tainted with derogatory labels including *hangjian* (traitor to the Han Chinese), *zougou* (running dog), *minzu zuiren* (criminal against the nation), and *erchen* (disloyal minister)—terms reflecting deep moral condemnation of those who collaborated with the Qing dynasty.[^112] Many modern Chinese, particularly during periods emphasizing ethnic Han nationalism, vilified Shi for his betrayal of Zheng Chenggong and the Ming loyalist cause, viewing his career as one of opportunism rather than principle.[^113]

Critics including Yang Qinhua and Xu Xiaowang have accused Shi Lang of feigning loyalty to the Zhengs while secretly planning betrayal, then subsequently exploiting and "sponging off" the Taiwanese people after the conquest.[^114] His massive land seizures—seizing almost half of the developed land in southern Taiwan for his personal profit—demonstrate that his advocacy for Taiwan's annexation was motivated significantly by greed rather than strategic vision or concern for the island's welfare.[^115] The annual extortion of monetary resources from rich and poor communities alike, combined with policies deliberately isolating Taiwan from the rest of the empire to maintain it as a personal fiefdom, reveal a pattern of systematic exploitation that undermines claims of benevolent governance.[^116]

From Taiwanese perspectives, Shi Lang represents foreign conquest, occupation, and exploitation. He is remembered as a conqueror and cruel governor whose primary legacy was bringing Taiwan under Manchu control and establishing patterns of external rule that denied Taiwanese autonomy.[^117] The Taiwanese local perspective views him as an incompetent, imperious minister who caused difficulties for the land rather than bringing benefits, with his governance characterized by corruption, isolation policies, and extractive economics that hindered Taiwan's development.[^118]

The exiled Kuomintang government saw Shi Lang as a convenient scapegoat who defected from the pro-Ming resistance to serve foreign conquerors, making him unsuitable for positive commemoration in a political culture that emphasized Chinese nationalism and resistance to foreign rule.[^119] During periods when the Qing dynasty was viewed negatively—particularly during the Republican era and early People's Republic—Shi Lang's close association with Qing conquest made him an unwelcome historical figure whose exploits were deliberately downplayed.[^120]

Scholars critical of hagiographic mainland interpretations note that Shi Lang's historical rehabilitation since the 1980s is transparently motivated by contemporary political concerns about Taiwan rather than genuine historical reassessment. The selective emphasis on his role in "unifying" Taiwan with China while minimizing his defection, exploitation, and corruption reveals how his legacy has been instrumentalized for nationalist purposes rather than objectively evaluated.[^121] This politicization of Shi Lang's memory demonstrates how historical figures are continually reconstructed to serve present-day political agendas, with the same individual celebrated as a hero or condemned as a villain depending entirely on the observer's political commitments regarding Taiwan's status.[^122]
