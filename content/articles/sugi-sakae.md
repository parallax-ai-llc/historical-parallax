## Summary

Ōsugi Sakae (大杉 栄, 1885-1923) was a Japanese anarchist writer, social critic, and labor organizer who emerged as a leading voice in Japan's anarchist movement during the Taishō period. Born into a military family, he rejected authoritarianism and developed a philosophy centered on individualism, direct action, and the "expansion of the ego" as foundations for personal and social revolution. His life ended tragically during the chaos following the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake when he, his partner Itō Noe, and his six-year-old nephew were murdered by military police in what became known as the Amakasu Incident, symbolizing state violence against political radicals.

## Early Life and Background

Ōsugi Sakae was born on January 17, 1885, in Marugame, Kagawa Prefecture, into a military family.[^1] His father, Ōsugi Azuma, served as a captain in the Imperial Japanese Army, which meant the family moved frequently throughout his childhood, eventually settling in Shibata, Niigata Prefecture, in 1889.[^2] His maternal uncle, Yamada Hōei, was a lieutenant general who served as an early role model for the young Ōsugi.[^3] His father was often absent and emotionally distant, while his mother, Yutaka, was a strong-willed woman who became a central figure in his childhood development.[^4]

Following the path expected of a military family's son, Ōsugi attended Nagoya Cadet School, but his rebellious nature soon manifested. In 1901, he was expelled from the military academy for insubordination and disorderly conduct.[^5] This expulsion marked a turning point in his life, liberating him from the rigid military career his family had envisioned. He moved to Tokyo to attend middle school, where he threw himself into his studies with fervor.[^6] During this period, he embarked on what he described as a spiritual journey, exploring various intellectual traditions and philosophies.

The death of his mother proved to be another pivotal moment in Ōsugi's intellectual development, ultimately leading him toward anarchism.[^7] In 1904, while still a young student in Tokyo, he came into contact with the socialist movement through *Heimin Shimbun* (Commoners' News), a radical, anti-war newspaper edited by the prominent socialists Kōtoku Shūsui and Sakai Toshihiko.[^8] This newspaper opposed Japan's war with Russia and advocated for workers' rights and social revolution. The ideas he encountered in its pages would shape the rest of his life, transforming him from a military school dropout into one of Japan's most influential anarchist thinkers.

## Rise to Prominence

Ōsugi's ascent within Japan's radical movement was marked by repeated confrontations with state authority and several periods of imprisonment that he paradoxically considered his "real education."[^9] He married Hori Yasuko in 1906, the same year he was first arrested for participating in a demonstration against a streetcar fare hike in Tokyo.[^10] This arrest was only the beginning of what would become a pattern of activism, imprisonment, and further radicalization.

The years between 1906 and 1910 proved formative for Ōsugi's development as an anarchist theorist and activist. He spent much of this period imprisoned for press law violations and participation in public demonstrations.[^11] The most significant of these arrests came in June 1908 during the Red Flag Incident, a public clash between anarchists and police. The incident occurred when political activist Koken Yamaguchi was released from prison and was met by a crowd waving red flags inscribed with anarchist slogans such as "anarcho-communism" and "revolution" while singing communist songs.[^12] Police violently suppressed the small demonstration, and ten prominent activists, including Ōsugi, were arrested.[^13]

Ōsugi received the heaviest sentence among those arrested—two and a half years in Chiba Prison.[^14] Paradoxically, this imprisonment may have saved his life, as it kept him incarcerated during the government crackdown that led to the High Treason Incident of 1910-1911, in which Kōtoku Shūsui and other leading anarchists were executed on fabricated charges of plotting to assassinate the Emperor.[^15] While imprisoned in Chiba, Ōsugi undertook a rigorous program of self-education, voraciously reading works by European anarchist thinkers including Mikhail Bakunin, Errico Malatesta, and especially Peter Kropotkin.[^16]

Kropotkin's theory of mutual aid, which presented cooperation rather than competition as a factor in evolution, particularly appealed to Ōsugi's scientific inclinations and became a cornerstone of his anarchist philosophy.[^17] This provided an alternative to the Social Darwinist competitive models that dominated much of contemporary political thought. When Ōsugi emerged from prison in 1910, he had transformed from a simple activist into a sophisticated anarchist theoretician ready to lead the movement.

Following his release, Ōsugi worked to rebuild the anarchist movement that had been devastated by the government's brutal suppression. In October 1912, he and fellow activist Arahata Kanson founded the journal *Kindai Shisō* (Modern Thought) to rekindle radical debate and disseminate anarchist ideas.[^18] The journal aimed to reinvigorate the dormant anarchist movement by publishing translations of Western anarchist texts by figures such as Peter Kropotkin and Max Stirner, alongside original Japanese anarchist writings.[^19] Through this and other journals such as *Rōdō Undō* (The Labor Movement), Ōsugi introduced Japanese audiences to the works of European radical thinkers including Georges Sorel and Henri Bergson.[^20]

## Major Achievements

Ōsugi Sakae's most significant achievements lay in his intellectual contributions to anarchist theory and his practical efforts to build a revolutionary labor movement in Japan. As a prolific writer and translator, he served as the primary conduit through which European anarchist and syndicalist thought entered Japan, while simultaneously developing his own distinctive philosophical approach.

His translation work proved invaluable to the Japanese anarchist movement. In 1917, he published a Japanese edition of Peter Kropotkin's seminal work *Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution* as *Sōgo Fujo Ron*.[^21] This was followed in 1920 by his translation of Kropotkin's *Memoirs of a Revolutionist*.[^22] These translations made foundational anarchist texts accessible to Japanese readers for the first time and helped establish the theoretical foundations of Japanese anarchism. Beyond Kropotkin, he also translated Charles Darwin's *The Origin of Species* and Jean-Henri Fabre's *Souvenirs Entomologiques*, demonstrating his wide-ranging intellectual interests and his belief in scientific knowledge as complementary to anarchist principles.[^23]

As an original thinker, Ōsugi developed a distinctive philosophy centered on what he called the "expansion of the ego."[^24] This concept drew on multiple intellectual traditions, combining readings of Bakunin and Kropotkin with influences from Friedrich Nietzsche, Henri Bergson, Max Stirner, and Georges Sorel.[^25] His philosophy represented a radical departure from traditional Japanese values of self-abnegation and duty to collective authorities, offering instead an ethos of personal liberation and self-creation. He articulated this vision eloquently: "When we consider the freedom and creativity of the ego, we feel that we must let it be the basis for individual and social progress. As Nietzsche says, the self, meditating and acting freely, is an eager arrow speeding to the target. We must seize and develop, then, the mysterious impulse which contains this self and the entire future. Freedom and creativity are not outside of us nor in the future. They are within us now."[^26]

His major written works include *Sei no Tōsō* (Struggle for Life, 1914), *Rōdō Undō no Tetsugaku* (Philosophy of the Labor Movement, 1916), *Kuropotokin Kenkyū* (Studies of Kropotkin, 1920), and *Seigi o Motomeru Kokoro* (Justice-Seeking Spirit, 1921).[^27] These works laid out his vision of anarcho-syndicalism adapted to Japanese conditions.

After 1917, Ōsugi shifted his focus increasingly toward practical labor organizing, seeking to put his theories into action.[^28] He moved to a working-class district of Tokyo and became deeply involved in organizing workers, playing an instrumental role in forming several syndicalist unions, including the Shin'yūkai (Sincere Friends' Society) and the Seishinkai (Righteously Advancing Society).[^29] In October 1919, he launched the journal *Rōdō Ūndō* to report on and encourage the labor movement across Japan.[^30]

Ōsugi's approach to labor organizing reflected his anti-authoritarian principles. He was highly critical of intellectuals (including himself) who sought to lead the working class from above, arguing instead that revolutionary ideas and initiatives must emerge spontaneously from workers themselves, based on their own experiences and desires.[^31] He viewed labor unions (syndicates) as microcosms of a future anarchist society, where workers could practice autonomy and self-governance in preparation for the revolutionary transformation of society.[^32]

His international connections expanded when, in November 1922, he received an invitation to an international anarchist congress in Berlin.[^33] Evading police surveillance, he departed secretly in December 1922, traveling to Shanghai where he obtained a false Chinese passport that allowed him to continue his journey to Europe.[^34] This trip represented the internationalization of his activism and his recognition as a significant figure in the global anarchist movement.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Ōsugi Sakae's personal life and political positions generated substantial controversy, both during his lifetime and in historical assessments. His most notorious scandal involved his simultaneous romantic relationships with three women, which culminated in violence and temporarily destroyed his standing within the radical movement.

Beginning in late 1915, Ōsugi pursued concurrent relationships with his wife Hori Yasuko, the journalist Kamichika Ichiko (with whom he began an affair in spring 1915), and the feminist-anarchist Itō Noe (whom he became involved with in 1916).[^35] He justified this arrangement as an experiment in "free love," proposing what he called a triangular relationship based on three rules: economic independence for all partners, maintaining separate residences, and complete freedom of action, including sexually.[^36] This arrangement reflected his philosophical commitment to individual freedom and his rejection of conventional morality, but it proved emotionally and financially devastating for all involved.

The situation reached a violent climax on November 8, 1916, in what became known as the Hayama incident. At an inn in Hayama, Kamichika Ichiko attacked a sleeping Ōsugi with a short sword, stabbing him in the throat.[^37] Though he survived, the incident became a major public scandal. Kamichika was sentenced to two years in prison for the attack.[^38] Ōsugi was widely condemned, not only by the general public but also by his comrades in the socialist movement, who felt his behavior had brought disrepute upon their cause.[^39] His wife Hori divorced him, and he was ostracized by many in the movement, left in personal and professional isolation.[^40] The scandal also contributed to the demise of *Seitō* (Bluestocking), the feminist magazine edited by Itō Noe.[^41]

Critics within the anarchist movement questioned whether Ōsugi's emphasis on individual ego and personal freedom could provide an adequate foundation for collective revolutionary action. Some viewed his philosophy as potentially selfish or narcissistic, prioritizing individual desire over social solidarity. His advocacy of "free love" was seen by many, even among radicals, as reckless experimentation that caused real harm to the women involved, particularly given the severe social stigma attached to women who violated conventional morality in early 20th-century Japan.

From the perspective of state authorities and conservative society, Ōsugi represented a dangerous threat to social order. His rejection of emperor-centered nationalism, his opposition to Japan's imperialist expansion, and his advocacy of workers' revolution made him a target for surveillance and repression throughout his adult life. The government viewed him as one of the most dangerous radical agitators in Japan, a perception that ultimately contributed to his murder.

Some scholars have noted that despite positioning himself as Japan's representative anarchist, Ōsugi used the word "anarchism" surprisingly infrequently in his writings, instead emphasizing concepts like the "expansion of the ego" drawn from European individualist philosophy.[^42] This has led some critics to question whether his philosophy truly represented anarchism or was instead a form of radical individualism only loosely connected to the anarchist tradition.

His relationship with the labor movement also generated tensions. While he advocated for anarcho-syndicalism and worked to organize workers, his insistence that intellectuals should not lead workers created practical difficulties for movement-building. Some labor organizers felt this position was impractical and hampered efforts to build effective unions and coordinate strike actions.

---

## Personal Life

Ōsugi Sakae's personal life was as unconventional and rebellious as his political philosophy. He was first married to Hori Yasuko in 1906, with whom he had several children.[^43] However, his commitment to the principle of "free love" and rejection of conventional morality led him into complex and ultimately destructive romantic entanglements.

His affair with journalist Kamichika Ichiko began in the spring of 1915.[^44] Kamichika was herself a radical figure, working as a journalist in an era when few women held such positions. Their relationship was passionate but tumultuous, especially after Ōsugi became simultaneously involved with Itō Noe in 1916. Ōsugi attempted to justify this arrangement philosophically, but the emotional reality proved far more complicated than his theories suggested. Kamichika's violent attack on him in November 1916 ended their relationship and marked a low point in his life.[^45]

After his divorce from Hori and the end of his relationship with Kamichika, Ōsugi remained with Itō Noe, who became his partner for the final seven years of his life.[^46] Itō Noe herself was a remarkable figure—a feminist writer, anarchist, and editor of the pioneering feminist journal *Seitō* (Bluestocking). The couple never formally married, as both rejected the institution of marriage as an oppressive social construct.[^47] Together they worked on both political writings and activism, and they had four children together.[^48] Their partnership represented a genuine collaboration between equals, with both contributing to anarchist theory and practice.

Ōsugi's personality combined intense intellectualism with a bohemian lifestyle. He expressed particular affection for Mikhail Bakunin, stating: "For Kropotkin one feels respect, but not attraction. There is a man who is much dearer to me ... a born anarchist, one so constitutionally rebellious that he would have remained a rebel even in an anarchist society. A man who was neither regular nor ordered in his habits, who lived a life which was bohemian and unruly. I cannot help but smile at myself when I reflect upon the life of our ancestor Bakunin."[^49] This quote reveals Ōsugi's identification with Bakunin's rebellious spirit and suggests he saw his own unconventional lifestyle as integral to his anarchist identity rather than contradictory to it.

Despite the controversies surrounding his personal life, those who knew him described a man of genuine commitment to his principles, willing to endure imprisonment and social ostracism for his beliefs. His nephew, Tachibana Munekazu, was visiting from Oregon when the Great Kantō earthquake struck—the boy's presence in Japan at that tragic moment speaks to Ōsugi's maintained family connections despite his radical lifestyle.[^50]

## Legacy

Ōsugi Sakae's legacy in Japanese anarchism and radical politics remains profound, though complex and contested. His dramatic life and violent death have, in some ways, overshadowed his important literary and theoretical contributions to anarchist thought.[^51] Nevertheless, he is remembered as one of the three leading figures who shaped Japan's pre-war anarchist movement, alongside Kōtoku Shūsui (1871-1911) and Ishikawa Sanshirō (1876-1956).[^52]

The manner of his death ensured that Ōsugi would be remembered as a martyr for the anarchist cause. The Amakasu Incident became a powerful symbol of state violence against political dissidents in Japan.[^53] The fact that he was murdered alongside his partner Itō Noe and his six-year-old nephew—an American citizen born in Portland, Oregon—added layers of tragedy and international attention to the case.[^54] The incident drew particular criticism from the United States due to the murder of a dual-national child, creating diplomatic tensions that embarrassed Japanese authorities.[^55]

The extraordinarily lenient treatment of his murderers reinforced perceptions of state complicity in political violence. Lieutenant Amakasu Masahiko was sentenced to only ten years in prison with hard labor for the triple murder, a sentence later reduced to seven years and six months before he was released under amnesty in October 1926 after serving barely three years.[^56] This stood in stark contrast to the harsh sentences imposed on leftist activists for far lesser offenses, highlighting the double standard in Japan's justice system when it came to political crimes.

Ōsugi's intellectual legacy continued to influence Japanese anarchism and radical thought throughout the 20th century. His philosophy of the "expansion of the ego" offered a distinctive Japanese contribution to anarchist theory, blending European individualist anarchism with his own creative synthesis.[^57] His emphasis on workers' self-organization and spontaneous revolutionary action influenced later generations of labor organizers and anarcho-syndicalists.

As an intellectual current, Japanese pre-war anarchism shaped by figures like Ōsugi helped define debates on the role and means of action of the Japanese Left in the context of the country's rapid capitalist development and imperialist expansion.[^58] The movement had its heyday during the second half of the Taishō era (1912-1926), when anarcho-syndicalism gained traction among intellectuals and segments of the working class.[^59]

His life has been commemorated in various cultural works, most notably Yoshishige Yoshida's 1969 experimental film *Eros Plus Massacre*, which explores his relationship with Itō Noe and his ideas about free love and political revolution.[^60] This film helped introduce Ōsugi to new generations and sparked renewed interest in Taishō-era radicalism.

Scholarly assessments of Ōsugi have evolved over time. While earlier accounts often focused on the scandalous aspects of his personal life, more recent scholarship has given greater attention to his theoretical writings and his role in building labor unions and anarchist organizations.[^61] His translations of Kropotkin and other anarchist thinkers are recognized as having played a crucial role in establishing anarchism as a significant political philosophy in Japan.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders of Ōsugi Sakae emphasize his significant intellectual contributions to anarchist theory and his crucial role in developing Japan's labor movement during a critical period of the country's modernization. Thomas A. Stanley's important study *Ōsugi Sakae, Anarchist in Taishō Japan: The Creativity of the Ego* presents him as a sophisticated theorist who developed a distinctively Japanese form of anarchism that synthesized European thought with indigenous concerns.[^62]

Supporters argue that his philosophy of ego expansion represented a necessary corrective to the oppressive collectivism that characterized both traditional Japanese society and the emerging Bolshevik alternative to anarchism. His emphasis on individual creativity and freedom as the basis for social transformation offered a humane alternative to authoritarian models of revolution. His vision of workers spontaneously organizing themselves without intellectual leadership demonstrated a genuine commitment to anti-authoritarian principles, even when this made practical organizing more difficult.

His courage in facing repeated imprisonment for his beliefs, his willingness to endure social ostracism for his unconventional personal life, and ultimately his martyrdom at the hands of military police have secured his place as a heroic figure in the history of Japanese radicalism. The fact that he was murdered alongside his partner and a young child added pathos to his story and illustrated the brutality of state repression during this period.

Progressive scholars note that Ōsugi's advocacy of free love, while controversial and imperfectly practiced, represented a genuine challenge to oppressive sexual morality and gender relations in early 20th-century Japan. His partnership with the feminist Itō Noe showed his commitment to gender equality unusual for his time. His critique of emperor-centered nationalism and Japanese imperialism demonstrated moral courage in an increasingly militaristic society.

Recent scholarship in the history of anarchism has emphasized the importance of Ōsugi's literary activities, particularly his work founding and editing journals that kept anarchist ideas alive during periods of intense repression.[^63] His translations made European anarchist thought accessible to Japanese readers and helped create an international anarchist culture. His original writings, particularly his philosophical works on ego and freedom, are now recognized as creative contributions to anarchist theory rather than mere applications of European ideas to Japanese conditions.

### Negative Views

Critics of Ōsugi Sakae, both contemporary and historical, have raised substantial concerns about his personal conduct, the practical implications of his philosophy, and his overall effectiveness as a revolutionary organizer. Conservative and nationalist critics viewed him as a dangerous radical whose ideas threatened the social fabric and whose personal immorality discredited his political positions. His rejection of loyalty to the emperor and the nation marked him as fundamentally un-Japanese in the eyes of many of his contemporaries.

Even among fellow leftists, Ōsugi faced criticism. Some socialists and communists argued that his emphasis on individual ego and spontaneous action lacked the organizational discipline necessary for effective revolutionary struggle. His opposition to intellectual leadership of workers, while principled, created practical difficulties for building a coherent labor movement. Marxists criticized anarchism generally, and Ōsugi's individualist variant particularly, as petit-bourgeois and insufficiently grounded in materialist analysis of capitalism.

His personal behavior, especially the triangular relationship experiment that ended in violence, drew harsh criticism even from fellow anarchists and feminists. Critics argued that his "free love" philosophy in practice meant freedom primarily for him as a man, while the women involved—particularly Kamichika Ichiko—suffered greater social consequences and emotional damage. The fact that Kamichika felt driven to violent attack suggests the arrangement was far from the mutually liberating experience Ōsugi theoretically envisioned. Some feminists have argued that his treatment of women revealed a failure to fully challenge patriarchal assumptions despite his radical rhetoric.

Scholarly critics have questioned whether Ōsugi's philosophy of ego expansion can genuinely be called anarchism, given his relatively infrequent use of the term "anarchism" itself and his heavy reliance on individualist philosophers like Nietzsche and Stirner who are sometimes seen as diverging from the communitarian traditions of anarchism.[^64] Some scholars suggest his thought might be better characterized as radical individualism only loosely connected to anarchist traditions.

His effectiveness as a revolutionary organizer has also been questioned. Despite his theoretical writings and attempts at labor organizing, the anarchist movement in Japan remained relatively small and was brutally suppressed. Critics argue that his emphasis on spontaneity and rejection of organizational structure left the movement vulnerable to state repression. His repeated imprisonments, while demonstrating personal courage, also limited his practical effectiveness.

Some historians have noted that Ōsugi's dramatic life and violent death have received disproportionate attention compared to his actual political and theoretical achievements, suggesting that he functions more as a romantic symbol of rebellion than as a genuinely important political thinker.[^65] The fascination with his unconventional personal life and martyrdom may obscure more substantive questions about the viability of his political philosophy and organizing strategies.
