## Summary
Griselda Blanco Restrepo, known as the 'Cocaine Godmother' and 'Black Widow,' was a Colombian drug lord who was a pioneer of the Medellín Cartel's cocaine trade in Miami during the 1970s and 1980s. She was responsible for an estimated 200 murders and is credited with pioneering motorcycle assassinations.

## Early Life
Born February 15, 1943, in Cartagena, Colombia. She grew up in extreme poverty in Medellín's slums. She was reportedly involved in petty crime from childhood, including kidnapping a child for ransom at age 11. She moved to the United States in the 1970s. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Blanco established cocaine distribution networks in New York, Miami, and California in the 1970s. She pioneered motorcycle drive-by assassinations (known as 'sicario' hits) and was responsible for an estimated 200 murders. She was a central figure in the 'Cocaine Cowboys' era of Miami. She reportedly earned $80 million per month at the height of her operations. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Blanco was arrested in 1985 and convicted of drug trafficking. She served 19 years in US federal prison before being deported to Colombia in 2004. On September 3, 2012, she was shot and killed by a motorcycle assassin in a Medellín butcher shop — the same method she had popularized. [^3]
