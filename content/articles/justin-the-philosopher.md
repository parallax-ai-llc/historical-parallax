## Summary

Justin Martyr was one of the earliest Christian apologists who sought to reconcile Christianity with Greek philosophy. His two Apologies and Dialogue with Trypho defended Christianity against pagan and Jewish critiques. He argued that Greek philosophers like Socrates were unknowingly guided by the same Logos (divine reason) that became incarnate in Christ. He was beheaded in Rome during the reign of Marcus Aurelius.
