## Summary

C.T.R. Wilson was a Scottish physicist who invented the cloud chamber, a device for detecting ionizing radiation. His cloud chamber became an essential tool for nuclear and particle physics, allowing scientists to visualize the tracks of charged particles. He shared the 1927 Nobel Prize in Physics for this invention. The cloud chamber led to the discovery of the positron and other fundamental particles.
