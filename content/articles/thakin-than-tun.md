## Summary

Thakin Than Tun (1911–1968) was a Burmese communist revolutionary and leader of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) from 1945 until his assassination in 1968. Born in Kanyutkwin, British Burma, he played a pivotal role in Myanmar's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. As brother-in-law to independence hero Aung San and co-founder of the influential Nagani Book Club, Than Tun shaped Burma's nationalist and socialist movements. After independence, he launched a decades-long armed insurgency against the Burmese government, ultimately meeting a violent end during his own Cultural Revolution-inspired purges.

## Early Life and Background

Thakin Than Tun was born in 1911 in Kanyutkwin, a small town in British Burma, reportedly to a family involved in the timber trade.[^1][^2] Growing up during a period of intense nationalist ferment against British colonial rule, Than Tun received his education at the Teachers' Training School in Rangoon (Yangon), where he qualified as a schoolteacher.[^3] His early career as an educator placed him in contact with Burma's emerging intelligentsia and exposed him to the political currents sweeping through colonial Southeast Asia.

During his years as a teacher, Than Tun became deeply influenced by Marxist literature, which was beginning to circulate among Burma's educated classes in the 1930s.[^4] The economic hardships of the Great Depression, combined with the perceived injustices of colonial rule, made socialist and communist ideologies particularly attractive to young Burmese intellectuals seeking both national liberation and social transformation. Than Tun's intellectual formation during this period would profoundly shape his subsequent political trajectory, leading him toward a lifelong commitment to communist revolution.

In 1936, Than Tun joined the Dobama Asiayone ("We Burmans Association" or "Our Burma Association"), the nationalist organization whose members adopted the honorific "Thakin" (meaning "master") to assert Burmese sovereignty and challenge colonial hierarchies that reserved such titles for Europeans.[^5] This movement represented a new, more radical phase of Burmese nationalism, moving beyond earlier moderate approaches toward direct confrontation with colonial power. Than Tun helped forge an alliance between Dobama Asiayone and Dr. Ba Maw's Poor Man's Party to form the Freedom Bloc, demonstrating early skills in political coalition-building that would mark his career.[^6]

The most significant intellectual contribution of Than Tun's early years came in 1937, when he co-founded the Nagani (Red Dragon) Book Club with fellow nationalist Thakin Nu.[^7] Modeled after the Left Book Club in London, this organization played a crucial role in introducing socialist and communist ideology to Burma's nationalist movement. From 1937 to 1941, the Nagani Book Club issued between 70 and 100 Burmese-language books covering literature, history, economics, politics, and science, along with a monthly newsletter.[^8] For the first time, Marxist classics became widely accessible in Burmese translation, profoundly influencing a generation of nationalists and revolutionaries. Than Tun first made his name during this period as the schoolteacher who wrote powerful speeches in both Burmese and English, establishing his reputation as an exceptional political organizer.[^9]

## Rise to Power

Than Tun's political ascent accelerated during World War II, a period of tremendous upheaval that transformed Burma's political landscape. In July 1941, while imprisoned in Insein Prison, Than Tun and fellow communist leader Thakin Soe co-authored the historic "Insein Manifesto."[^10] This document identified world fascism as the principal enemy in the coming global conflict and called for temporary cooperation with the British in a broad allied coalition that included the Soviet Union.[^11] The manifesto followed the Popular Front line advanced by Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov at the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935, prioritizing anti-fascist unity over immediate anti-colonial struggle.[^12]

This position proved prescient but controversial, setting Than Tun apart from many Burmese nationalists who initially welcomed Japanese invasion as an opportunity to expel the British. When the Japanese occupied Burma in 1942 and established Ba Maw's nominally independent government, Than Tun accepted the position of Minister of Land and Agriculture.[^13] His cabinet colleagues included Aung San as War Minister and socialist leaders Thakins Nu and Mya. However, Than Tun's service in this Japanese-backed government was duplicitous; he secretly passed Japanese intelligence to Thakin Soe, who had gone underground to organize resistance against the occupation.[^14] This demonstrated Than Tun's commitment to the anti-fascist principles of the Insein Manifesto despite his official collaboration.

As Japanese rule proved increasingly oppressive and exploitative, Burmese leaders began organizing resistance. In August 1944, Aung San initiated negotiations with communist leaders Than Tun and Thakin Soe, along with socialist leaders Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein, leading to the formation of the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO), which later became the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL).[^15] Following Japan's defeat and the British return to Burma, Than Tun became general secretary of the AFPFL, a powerful coalition formed by the Communist Party of Burma, the People's Revolutionary Party (later the Socialist Party), and the Burma National Army led by his brother-in-law Aung San.[^16] His organizational skills and political acumen were unequaled, and he had played a pre-eminent role at every stage of Burma's independence struggle.[^17]

During this period, Than Tun also married Khin Khin Gyi, the elder sister of Khin Kyi, who was married to Aung San.[^18] These marriages, which occurred around the same time in 1942, created a family alliance between Burma's communist and nationalist leaders. Than Tun thus became the brother-in-law of Myanmar's independence hero Aung San and later the uncle of Aung San Suu Kyi, though this family connection would not prevent bitter political conflicts.[^19]

## Major Achievements

Than Tun's most significant political achievement was establishing and leading the Communist Party of Burma as a major force in the country's post-independence politics. Although he was not among the six founders of the CPB on August 15, 1939 (Aung San was its first secretary general), Than Tun became the party's dominant leader after World War II.[^20] His intellectual contributions to Burmese communism included co-authoring the Insein Manifesto, which provided ideological justification for tactical alliances against fascism, and his work with the Nagani Book Club, which disseminated Marxist theory throughout Burma's nationalist movement.[^21]

Under Than Tun's initial leadership in the AFPFL, the coalition became the dominant political force in Burma's transition to independence. His Marxist ideology shaped his approach to nationalism and social justice, emphasizing class struggle and the rights of workers and peasants.[^22] The Communist Party advocated for radical land reform, workers' rights, and rapid social transformation—positions that resonated with Burma's impoverished rural majority and urban working class. Initially, the CPB adapted Marxist-Leninist principles through advocacy of a "peaceful development" strategy, which emphasized temporary alliances with bourgeois nationalists and even ideological adversaries to achieve national independence and democratic reforms.[^23] This pragmatism prioritized anti-imperialist unity over immediate class confrontation.

Following independence in January 1948, Than Tun demonstrated organizational genius in transforming the CPB from a legal political party into an effective insurgent force. After orders were issued to arrest the CPB leadership on March 28, 1948, Than Tun escaped and led his party underground to organize armed revolution.[^24] He established guerrilla bases in central Burma, particularly around the CPB stronghold at Pyinmana, his adopted base of operations.[^25] On April 2, 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of their post-independence insurgency in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region, marking the beginning of what would become a four-decade-long armed struggle.[^26]

The White Flag insurgency initially achieved significant military successes under Than Tun's leadership. CPB forces captured Kamase in Pegu district on April 7, 1948, followed by coordinated assaults on Pyinmana, Yamethin, and Myingyan between February 20 and 23, 1949, and later Henzada, Pakokku in March 1949, and Tharrawaddy on April 9, 1949.[^27] At its height, the White Flag insurrection involved as many as 25,000 rebels and spread through central Burma in the Sittang-Pegu Yoma region.[^28] These gains allowed temporary territorial control over pockets of the Irrawaddy Delta and surrounding plains, enabling the establishment of administrative structures and resource extraction in captured areas.[^29]

Than Tun's advocacy for socialism, anti-colonial nationalism, and the empowerment of Myanmar's working class left a deep mark on the country's political discourse.[^30] His leadership shaped the CPB into the most significant leftist challenge to Burma's post-independence governments, forcing successive administrations to contend with a sustained communist insurgency that highlighted deep social and economic grievances within Burmese society.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The rift between Than Tun and the nationalist leadership that culminated in his expulsion from the AFPFL represented the first major controversy of his career. After Aung San and other AFPFL leaders accepted seats in the British Executive Council to negotiate independence, the CPB accused them of settling for "sham" independence and selling out to imperialism.[^31] In July 1946, Than Tun was forced to resign as general secretary of the AFPFL, and the CPB—now dubbed the "White Flag" faction—was expelled from the coalition in October 1946.[^32] Socialist leader Kyaw Nyein demanded the communists' expulsion after they refused to withdraw accusations that Aung San and others were "power hungry traitors who had surrendered to the British."[^33] This bitter split fractured Burma's independence movement and established a pattern of communist opposition to parliamentary politics.

The decision to launch armed insurgency immediately after independence remains deeply controversial. On March 13, 1948, Than Tun addressed a crowd of 75,000 peasants in Pyinmana, explicitly calling for the overthrow of the AFPFL and the initiation of armed struggle.[^34] Critics argued that this premature resort to violence undermined Burma's fragile democracy and plunged the newly independent nation into civil war just two months after gaining sovereignty. The communist insurgency contributed to decades of instability, militarization, and authoritarian rule, with some historians arguing that Than Tun's sectarianism sacrificed the possibility of democratic socialist transformation for futile armed struggle.[^35]

Initial military successes proved short-lived as government counteroffensives rapidly eroded communist territorial holdings. Operation Twin Brother in 1951 expelled CPB forces from the Pegu Yoma region and inflicted heavy casualties, reducing effective fighting strength to scattered guerrilla bands.[^36] By the mid-1950s, the CPB's inability to hold territory or expand beyond rural strongholds highlighted strategic overreliance on Maoist protracted warfare without sufficient adaptation to Burma's fragmented terrain and limited supply lines.[^37] The party's focus on ideological purity over pragmatic power-building disengaged the CPB from mass politics, with participation in post-independence elections or coalitions viewed as capitulation rather than opportunity, thus confining the movement to marginal rural insurgency without broader popular mobilization.[^38]

The most damning controversy of Than Tun's leadership was his implementation of a party "Cultural Revolution" modeled on China's catastrophic campaign. Frustrated with the failure of 1963 peace talks with General Ne Win's government and inspired by Mao's radical purges, Than Tun ordered the CPB to begin its own "Cultural Revolution" in 1967, abandoning its previous position of "peace and unity" for revolutionary Maoist extremism.[^39] A mass campaign of purges and summary executions immediately followed, characterized by the Rangoon press as a policy of "purge, dismiss, and eliminate."[^40]

On April 27, 1967, Thakin Ba Tin and Yèbaw Htay were suspended from the politburo, while other senior members like Yèbaw Ba Khet fled the party, sensing impending danger.[^41] Thakin Ba Tin was summarily tried and executed on June 18, 1967, followed by Yèbaw Htay, whose own son was forced to form part of the execution squad in a grotesque demonstration of ideological loyalty.[^42] Bo Yan Aung, who had accompanied Aung San to seek military training abroad and was one of the legendary Thirty Comrades, was executed on December 26, 1967.[^43] On December 15, 1967, Than Tun and the remaining politburo passed a resolution to adopt the "intraparty revolutionary line" and ordered party cadres across the country to carry out their own purges.[^44]

The Cultural Revolution purges devastated the CPB. Much of the party's old guard, as well as several student leaders who had joined after the failed 1963 peace talks, were killed under Than Tun's orders.[^45] As in China, things spiraled out of control before Than Tun could finally pull the reins back, but great damage had already been done to the CPB's image, particularly the killing of young, enthusiastic recruits.[^46] Some leftist critics characterized the communist party's later degradation as a "personality cult of Stalinism and Maoism under the illiterate leadership of Thakin Than Tun, Thakin Zin, and Thakin Chit."[^47] These purges are considered the main reason the CPB lost its influence over the mass population in Myanmar.[^48]

## Personal Life

Thakin Than Tun married Khin Khin Gyi, the elder sister of Khin Kyi (who married Aung San), around 1942 during the Japanese occupation when he served as Minister of Land and Agriculture in Ba Maw's government.[^49] This marriage created a remarkable family connection at the heart of Burma's independence movement, making Than Tun the brother-in-law of national hero Aung San and later the uncle of Nobel laureate and democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi.[^50] However, this family bond could not bridge the widening political chasm between the communist and nationalist factions.

The sources provide limited details about Than Tun's personal life beyond these political connections. He first gained recognition as a schoolteacher who wrote powerful speeches in both Burmese and English, suggesting considerable linguistic ability and rhetorical skill.[^51] As a political organizer, his skills were described as unequaled, and he played a pre-eminent role at every stage of Burma's struggle for independence.[^52] This suggests a personality marked by dedication, organizational genius, and powerful charisma.

Than Tun's background as an educator from a timber-trading family indicates middle-class origins rather than the peasant or working-class background sometimes associated with revolutionary leaders.[^53] His intellectual orientation toward Marxism came through reading and study rather than direct experience of exploitation, marking him as part of Burma's radicalized intelligentsia. His co-founding of the Nagani Book Club demonstrates a commitment to education and ideological development as tools of political transformation.[^54]

After launching the armed insurgency in 1948, Than Tun spent the remaining twenty years of his life underground, leading a guerrilla organization while constantly evading government forces. This life on the run, spent in jungle camps and remote strongholds, must have been physically demanding and personally isolating. Details about his family life during this period, including whether Khin Khin Gyi accompanied him or remained in Rangoon, remain unclear from available sources. The sources similarly provide no information about whether Than Tun had children.

His final years appear marked by increasing radicalization and paranoia, culminating in the brutal purges of 1967-1968 that destroyed much of his own party's leadership and alienated many loyal members.[^55] This descent into factional violence suggests either ideological rigidity or perhaps deteriorating judgment under the stress of prolonged insurgency and repeated military setbacks.

## Legacy

Thakin Than Tun's assassination on September 24, 1968, by his subordinate Mya Gyi—a former Burmese military soldier who had joined the communists just two years earlier as an "army deserter"—marked a violent end to his revolutionary career.[^56] The killing occurred in the Toungoo District, Bago Region (the Pegu Yoma mountains), where the CPB maintained its headquarters while on the run from government troops.[^57] The assassin surrendered to General Ne Win's government the day after killing Than Tun.[^58] While some sources describe Mya Gyi as acting from personal grievances and party betrayals, others characterize him as a government agent.[^59] The true motivation remains contested, though the assassination clearly reflected the internal tensions created by Than Tun's brutal purges and the broader crisis within the CPB.

Than Tun's death came at a critical juncture for Burmese communism. At the end of 1967, he had ordered the Communist Party to go on the offensive on all fronts, with China providing modern weapons and support following the Sino-Soviet split.[^60] Initially oriented toward Soviet communism, the CPB had shifted allegiance to China and secured extensive aid including arms, ammunition, military advisers, and volunteers from 1968 onward.[^61] However, the offensive led to retaliatory government action, defeat of the main communist forces, and abandonment of bases, culminating in Than Tun's death during a retreat in September 1968.[^62]

Despite his violent end and the controversies surrounding his leadership, Thakin Than Tun remains a significant figure in Burmese history. His advocacy for socialism, anti-colonial nationalism, and the empowerment of Myanmar's working class left a deep mark on the country's political discourse.[^63] The Communist Party of Burma continued after his death, eventually establishing a northeastern headquarters at Panghsang in Shan State in the late 1960s-1970s, where it created a 20,000 square kilometer "liberated area" near the Yunnan border supported by Chinese assistance.[^64] However, the party never recovered its earlier strength and ultimately collapsed following an internal mutiny in 1989.

Than Tun's legacy influenced numerous ethnic insurgencies and leftist movements across Myanmar that persisted long after his death.[^65] His leadership during Burma's turbulent mid-twentieth century contributed to the prolonged civil conflicts and insurgencies that plagued the young nation and continue to affect Myanmar's politics today.[^66] The militarization of Burmese politics, partly driven by the need to combat communist insurgency, helped create conditions for decades of military rule.

The Communist Party of Burma, though weakened over time, demonstrated that significant portions of Burma's population felt alienated from the post-independence political order and attracted to radical alternatives promising social transformation.[^67] Than Tun's movement highlighted deep class divisions, rural grievances, and ethnic tensions that Burma's nationalist government failed to adequately address. In this sense, his insurgency served as both symptom and cause of Myanmar's post-independence instability.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters of Than Tun emphasize his central role in Burma's independence struggle and his principled commitment to anti-imperialism. His co-authorship of the Insein Manifesto demonstrated ideological sophistication in identifying fascism as the primary threat and advocating tactical alliances, positioning Burmese communism within broader international anti-fascist movements.[^68] This ideological clarity contrasted with those who opportunistically collaborated with Japanese fascism without reservations.

The Nagani Book Club remains recognized as a crucial contribution to Burmese intellectual and political development. By disseminating Marxist classics and modern political theory in Burmese translation, Than Tun and his colleagues educated a generation of activists and provided intellectual foundations for Burma's independence movement.[^69] This contribution transcended narrow party interests and enriched Burma's political culture more broadly.

Defenders note Than Tun's exceptional skills as a political organizer and his ability to build coalitions, as demonstrated by his leadership of the AFPFL during the critical post-war period.[^70] His powerful speeches in both Burmese and English helped mobilize mass support for independence and articulate visions of social transformation that resonated with ordinary Burmese people. His Marxist ideology provided a framework for understanding colonial exploitation and imagining alternative social arrangements based on justice and equality.[^71]

Some historians argue that Than Tun's resort to armed struggle, while tragic, reflected genuine grievances about the limitations of Burma's independence and the AFPFL government's failure to implement radical social reforms.[^72] From this perspective, he represented constituencies—particularly peasants and workers—whose interests were marginalized in the post-independence political order. His insurgency, whatever its tactical failures, kept alive visions of more thorough social transformation and challenged the emerging authoritarian tendencies in Burmese politics.

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize Than Tun's sectarianism and the destructive consequences of his political choices. His accusations that Aung San and other nationalist leaders were "power hungry traitors" who had "sold out to the British" fractured Burma's independence coalition at a critical moment and created lasting political divisions.[^73] This maximalist rhetoric prioritized ideological purity over practical achievement and demonstrated inability to compromise or work within democratic frameworks.

The decision to launch armed insurgency immediately after independence is viewed by many historians as catastrophically irresponsible. Than Tun's call to 75,000 peasants on March 13, 1948, to overthrow the government plunged Burma into civil war just two months after gaining sovereignty, devastating the economy, militarizing politics, and creating conditions for eventual military dictatorship.[^74] Rather than working through democratic institutions to achieve progressive reforms, he chose violence that ultimately achieved nothing while causing immense suffering.

Military analysts point to the strategic failures of Than Tun's insurgency. Despite initial territorial gains, government counteroffensives rapidly reversed these victories, with Operation Twin Brother in 1951 demonstrating the CPB's inability to hold ground against organized military forces.[^75] By the mid-1950s, the movement was confined to marginal rural areas with no prospect of seizing power.[^76] Critics argue that this reflects fundamental strategic incompetence—applying Maoist theories of protracted people's war without adequate consideration of Burma's specific conditions, including ethnic fragmentation, difficult terrain, and limited popular support in many regions.

The Cultural Revolution purges of 1967-1968 represent Than Tun's most indefensible actions. The summary executions of senior party leaders like Thakin Ba Tin, Yèbaw Htay, and Bo Yan Aung—including forcing Htay's own son to participate in his father's execution—demonstrated monstrous cruelty and ideological fanaticism.[^77] These purges devastated the CPB's human capital, killing experienced leaders and enthusiastic young recruits alike, and destroyed the party's moral authority.[^78] That Than Tun himself was assassinated by a party member reflects the internal hatred and fear his purges generated.

Leftist critics note that Than Tun's focus on armed struggle marginalized the CPB from mass politics and confined it to rural insurgency without broader popular mobilization.[^79] His rejection of "right opportunism" and refusal to participate in elections or coalitions represented dogmatism over pragmatic power-building. Some characterize his later leadership as descending into a "personality cult of Stalinism and Maoism" that degraded Burma's communist movement.[^80] The purges are widely considered the main reason the CPB lost popular influence and ultimately failed.[^81]
