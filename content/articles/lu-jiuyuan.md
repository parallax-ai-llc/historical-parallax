## Summary

Lu Jiuyuan (Lu Xiangshan) was a Chinese Neo-Confucian philosopher who founded the idealist School of Mind (Xinxue), arguing that the mind itself is principle (li). His famous debate with Zhu Xi at the Goose Lake Temple in 1175 established the fundamental divide in Neo-Confucian philosophy between the School of Principle and the School of Mind. Wang Yangming later developed his philosophy into a comprehensive system.
