## Summary

Shinya Yamanaka is a Japanese stem cell researcher who shared the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This breakthrough, achieved by introducing just four genes, revolutionized regenerative medicine and opened new possibilities for disease modeling and drug development without ethical issues of embryonic stem cells.
