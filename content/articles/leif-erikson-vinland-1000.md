## Overview

Leif Erikson (Old Norse: *Leifur Eiríksson*, c. 970 – c. 1020) was a Norse explorer who is currently recognized as the first European to set foot on continental North America—nearly 500 years before Christopher Columbus. The son of **Erik the Red**, the outlaw founder of the Greenland Norse colony, Leif sailed west around 1000 AD into the unknown waters of the North Atlantic. He discovered a land of forests and wild grapes, which he named **Vinland**. For centuries, his journey was dismissed as a myth from the Icelandic Sagas, until the shocking archaeological discovery of a Viking settlement at **L'Anse aux Meadows** in Newfoundland in 1960 proved the Sagas true.

## The Viking Expansion

The Norse expansion was a leap-frogging process across the Atlantic:
1.  **Norway** -> **Iceland** (870 AD)
2.  **Iceland** -> **Greenland** (985 AD) - Led by the exiled murderer Erik the Red.
3.  **Greenland** -> **Vinland** (1000 AD) - Led by Leif.

**The Accidental Discovery:**
According to the *Saga of the Greenlanders*, a merchant named Bjarni Herjólfsson got lost in fog while sailing to Greenland and saw a forested coast to the west but refused to land.
Leif, years later, bought Bjarni's ship and hired his crew to find this land properly.

## The Three Lands

Leif mapped three distinct regions representing the geography of the Canadian northeast:
1.  **Helluland ("Flat Stone Land"):** Baffin Island. A desolate landscape of glaciers and flat rocks. "No benefits to be had here."
2.  **Markland ("Forest Land"):** The coast of Labrador. Crucial for the Greenlanders because Greenland had no trees for timber/building ships.
3.  **Vinland ("Wine Land"):** Newfoundland (or possibly the Gulf of St. Lawrence).
    *   **Climate:** Mild winters where "grass hardly withered."
    *   **Name:** Leif's foster-father, Tyrkir (a German), wandered off and found wild grapes (or squashberries fermented into wine). He returned drunk and happy.

## The Settlement: L'Anse aux Meadows

Leif built a base, **Leifsbudir** (Leif's Booths).
Archaeologists Helge and Anne Stine Ingstad found it in 1960.
**Evidence:**
- 8 turf buildings (longhouses).
- A bronze ring-headed pin (Norse design).
- Iron smelting slag (Natives didn't use iron).
- Butternuts (which only grow as far south as New Brunswick, proving they explored further south than the base).

## Contact: The Skrælings (Indigenous Peoples)

The Vikings encountered indigenous inhabitants (probably ancestors of the Beothuk or Mi'kmaq). They called them **Skrælings** (a derogatory term meaning "wretches" or "shrivelled skins").

**First Contact:**
Leif's brother, **Thorvald**, explored further. They found 9 indigenous men sleeping under canoes. The Vikings killed 8 of them. One escaped.
**Retaliation:** A massive fleet of canoes attacked. Thorvald was shot in the armpit by an arrow and died. He was the first European to die in America.

**Freydis's Last Stand:**
Leif's sister (or half-sister), Freydis Eiriksdottir, led a later expedition.
When the Skrælings attacked their camp, the Norse men panicked and fled.
Freydis, heavily pregnant, picked up a sword from a dead warrior. She exposed her breast and slapped the sword blade against it, screaming a war cry. The sight was so terrifying/bizarre that the natives retreated.

## Why Abandonment?

Despite the rich resources (timber, grapes, salmon), the settlement lasted only a decade.
1.  **Demographics:** Greenland's total population was only ~2,500. They couldn't spare enough people to hold a colony against thousands of hostile natives.
2.  **Technology:** Viking iron weapons weren't superior enough to stone-age numbers. Viking mail armor was useless against arrows.
3.  **Distance:** A 2-week sail across dangerous icy seas to Greenland.

## Legacy

The Norse retreated to Greenland (which they inhabited for 450 more years until mysteriously dying out).
The discovery of Vinland remained a "family secret" within Norse society. It didn't trigger a global Age of Discovery because Europe wasn't ready (economically or technologically) to exploit it.
**Leif Erikson Day (Oct 9):** Officially recognized in the US to honor Norse heritage (and because Columbus Day is controversial).
