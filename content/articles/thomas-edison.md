## Summary

Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931) was an American inventor and businessman who developed many devices profoundly influencing modern life, including the phonograph, motion picture camera, and practical electric light bulb. Holding 1,093 U.S. patents, Edison established the first industrial research laboratory and pioneered the concept of systematic invention. His development of electric power generation and distribution systems brought electricity to homes and businesses. Though celebrated as "The Wizard of Menlo Park," Edison was also a ruthless competitor who engaged in patent battles and the infamous "War of Currents" against Nikola Tesla's AC system. His legacy combines genuine innovation with aggressive business practices and credit controversies.

## Early Life

Born in Milan, Ohio, Edison had little formal education (homeschooled by mother after teachers called him "addled"). Worked as newsboy, telegraph operator. Self-taught, read voraciously.

## Major Inventions

**Phonograph (1877):**
- First device to record and reproduce sound
- "Talking machine" amazed public
- Later improved for commercial music industry

**Electric Light Bulb (1879):**
- Didn't invent light bulb but made it practical
- Long-lasting filament (carbonized bamboo)
- Entire electrical distribution system
- Pearl Street Station (1882): First commercial power plant

**Motion Picture Camera (1891):**
- Kinetoscope for viewing films
- Foundation of film industry

**Other Inventions:**
- Telegraph improvements
- Stock ticker
- Alkaline battery
- Cement production

## Menlo Park Laboratory

Established first industrial research lab (1876) in Menlo Park, NJ. Team of researchers ("muckers") worked systematically on inventions. Model for modern R&D.

Famous quote: "Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."

## War of Currents (1880s-1890s)

Edison's DC power competed with Tesla/Westinghouse's AC.

**Edison's Campaign:**
- Promoted DC as safe, AC as dangerous
- Public demonstrations electrocuting animals (including elephant Topsy)
- Backed electric chair using AC ("Westinghoused")
- Lost the war: AC was superior for long-distance transmission

This revealed Edison's ruthless side.

## Controversies

**Credit Issues:**
- Employees (like Tesla) claimed Edison took credit for their work
- Patent battles over inventions
- Some inventions improved others' ideas rather than wholly original

**Business Practices:**
- Aggressive patent litigation
- Attempts to monopolize industries
- Questionable ethics in War of Currents

**Staff Treatment:**
- Promised bonuses he didn't pay (allegedly to Tesla)
- Demanded long hours

## Personal Life

**Marriages:**
- Mary Stilwell (1871-1884, died)
- Mina Miller (1886-1931)
- Six children total

**Character:**
- Workaholic (little sleep)
- Practical, empirical approach
- Poor theoretical understanding
- Charismatic, good with press

**Deafness:**
- Partially deaf from childhood illness/injury
- Claimed it helped him concentrate

## Later Years

Continued inventing into old age. During WWI, headed Naval Consulting Board. Friendship with Henry Ford (vacationed together).

**Death:** October 18, 1931, age 84, complications from diabetes. Nation dimmed lights in tribute.

---

## Legacy

**Inventions:**
- Transformed modern life (electricity, recorded sound, film)
- Industrial research model

**Business:**
- General Electric emerged from Edison companies
- Patent system influence

**Popular Culture:**
- American icon of innovation
- "Wizard," genius inventor
- Inspiration vs. perspiration quote

**Reevaluation:**
- Recognized as great innovator AND ruthless businessman
- Credit controversies continue
- Tesla's rehabilitation has somewhat dimmed Edison's halo
