## Summary

King Jeongjo (Yi San), the 22nd monarch of Korea's Joseon Dynasty, reigned from 1776 to 1800 and is often called "Jeongjo the Great."[^1] Born into tragedy as the son of Crown Prince Sado, who was executed by his own father King Yeongjo, Jeongjo overcame political adversity to become one of Korea's most enlightened rulers.[^2] His reign marked a cultural and political renaissance characterized by ambitious reforms, the construction of the magnificent Hwaseong Fortress, and the promotion of practical learning.[^3] Despite his achievements, his sudden death at age 47 left many of his visionary reforms incomplete, and his reign remains a subject of scholarly debate regarding the limits of reform within Joseon's rigid political system.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Yi San was born on October 28, 1752, into one of the most tragic periods of Joseon royal history.[^5] His father, Crown Prince Sado, suffered from severe mental illness that manifested in violent episodes and behavioral problems that began in his youth.[^6] The relationship between Sado and his father King Yeongjo deteriorated catastrophically, culminating in one of Korean history's most infamous events. In 1762, when Yi San was only 11 years old, he witnessed his grandfather King Yeongjo order his father sealed inside a rice chest, where Sado died after eight days, most likely from dehydration and starvation.[^7]

This traumatic event fundamentally shaped Jeongjo's life and reign. To protect the young prince's claim to the throne, King Yeongjo ordered him to be formally adopted by Crown Prince Hyojang, Sado's older half-brother who had died in childhood.[^8] This legal fiction allowed Yi San to maintain his position as heir while distancing him from his father's disgrace. His mother, Lady Hyegyŏng, later wrote the famous "Memoirs of Lady Hyegyŏng," which detailed her life as the ill-fated Crown Princess and offered explanations for the deaths of her husband and many maternal relatives, providing invaluable historical insight into this tumultuous period.[^9]

Despite the trauma surrounding his childhood, Yi San received exceptional education befitting a crown prince. Once officially named Crown Prince, he entered Sigangwon, a special institution staffed by over twenty of Korea's greatest minds, including potentially the Prime Minister himself.[^10] Among the King's entourage, Kim Jong-su had a particularly profound influence, becoming both a great teacher and father figure to the young prince.[^11] Yi San was trained in martial arts including swordsmanship, horseback riding, and archery, as well as arts and music such as poetry, painting, and calligraphy.[^12] He proved exceptionally studious and well-read, cultivating deep knowledge of humanities and Neo-Confucian philosophy that would define his approach to governance.[^13]

---

## Rise to Power

Yi San ascended to the throne on March 10, 1776, following the death of his grandfather King Yeongjo.[^14] In a bold and unprecedented move, the first statement Jeongjo made to his officials was a declaration that would define his entire reign: "I am the son of Prince Sado."[^15] This extraordinary proclamation served multiple purposes—it honored his father's memory, established his legitimacy through blood rather than adoption, and signaled to the court that he would not be a puppet monarch controlled by the powerful factions that had contributed to his father's death.

Jeongjo's path to power had been fraught with danger and political intrigue. His father Crown Prince Sado's execution in 1762 led to intense conflicts over Yi San's legitimacy as heir.[^16] The Joseon court was deeply divided into factions, with some questioning whether the son of an executed prince could rightfully inherit the throne. The political factions that had opposed his father now feared retribution from the young king, while those who had supported Sado hoped for vindication.[^17]

Understanding that his survival and success depended on skillful political maneuvering, Jeongjo immediately began implementing his grandfather's Tangpyeong policy, a political harmony strategy designed to balance competing factions.[^18] However, Jeongjo developed his own distinctive approach. While King Yeongjo's conciliation Tangpyeong focused on relieving confrontation between factions by arranging moderate personages properly, King Jeongjo's loyalty Tangpyeong emphasized strengthening the bond between sovereign and subject rather than mere power arrangement.[^19] He exercised balanced and integrated leadership by opening offices to talented individuals and compromising factional strife, favoring members of the Soron and Namin parties over the powerful Noron faction as a way to establish checks and balances and strengthen royal authority.[^20]

## Major Achievements

### Establishment of Kyujanggak Royal Library

Within months of ascending the throne in 1776, King Jeongjo founded the Kyujanggak royal library as a major policy arm of his government, initially located on the grounds of Changdeokgung Palace.[^21] The primary purpose of Kyujanggak was to improve the cultural and political stance of Joseon and to recruit gifted officers to help run the nation.[^22] This institution became the intellectual center of reform-minded scholarship during his reign.[^23]

In a revolutionary break from tradition, Jeongjo used Kyujanggak to dismantle systemic discrimination. In 1779, he appointed competent people from the seo-eol class—children of noble fathers and common mothers who had traditionally faced severe discrimination—as copy editors and researchers.[^24] Notable seo-eol scholars appointed included Yi Deok-mu, Park Je-ga, and Yu Deuk-gong, who became key supporters of his reformist agenda.[^25] Jeongjo had the support of many Silhak (Practical Learning) scholars who favored regal power over partisan politics, including the brilliant scholars Jeong Yak-yong, Pak Ji-won, Pak Je-ga, and Yu Deuk-gong.[^26]

### Construction of Hwaseong Fortress

King Jeongjo's most visible and ambitious achievement was the construction of Hwaseong Fortress in Suwon, built between 1794 and 1796.[^27] The fortress served multiple purposes: it housed and honored the remains of his father Prince Sado, whose tomb Jeongjo had moved to Suwon in 1789, and it represented his vision for a new political and economic center free from the factional conflicts of Seoul.[^28]

The fortress was principally designed by Jeong Yak-yong and incorporated the most highly developed features of science and engineering from both East and West, representing the pinnacle of 18th-century military architecture.[^29] In a demonstration of his benevolent governance, King Jeongjo provided employment to approximately 700,000 common people with good wages and excellent benefits during construction.[^30] When court officials suggested mobilizing people or Buddhist monks without paying them, the king refused, insisting that workers should be compensated fairly.[^31] This may have been one of the first times in Korean history that workers were paid for their labor, as corvée labor had been common previously.[^32]

The fortress was designated as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in 1997, and it has had a great influence on the development of Korean architecture, urban planning, and landscaping.[^33]

### Urban Planning and Economic Development

King Jeongjo's vision extended beyond the fortress itself to comprehensive urban development of Suwon. He initiated the city's development in 1789, ordering residents to relocate below Paldalsan Mountain and planning for Suwon to become an economic powerhouse with its own local government office, Confucian school, and temporary palace for royal visits.[^34] Commercial facilities were strategically placed along main boulevards, as the king planned for his people to engage in all manners of commercial activity, creating a new economic city in line with the development of commerce in the late Joseon period.[^35]

In 1791, Jeongjo enacted the Shinhae Tonggong (free trade law), allowing open market sales and abolishing the Gumnanjeonguoun law, which had restricted market participation to certain merchant groups.[^36] Tax exemptions were offered to encourage settlement in Suwon, fostering economic and administrative growth in the region.[^37] Although Jeongjo's sudden death in 1800 prevented the full relocation of the capital from Seoul to Suwon, the site remained a potent emblem of his reformist vision, blending filial piety with innovative urban planning.[^38]

### Military Reforms

In 1793, King Jeongjo established the Jangyongyeong (Royal Elite Camp), one of his most significant military reforms that helped modernize and strengthen the Joseon Dynasty's military capabilities.[^39] The unit was revolutionary in its composition—soldiers were selected from the common people rather than the aristocratic class, and it was open to commoners who demonstrated exceptional martial skills and loyalty to the king, representing a significant break from traditional practices.[^40]

Soldiers in the Jangyongyeong Guard underwent rigorous training in martial arts, archery, and other combat skills, and were equipped with modern firearms such as muskets and rifles.[^41] To counter cavalry tactics, battle formations specifically for mounted combat and equestrian martial arts for actual battle were reinforced.[^42] Large-caliber guns and weapons for close combat were deployed to protect the fortress and increase the possibility of stable victory in battle.[^43] King Jeongjo commissioned the Muyedobotongji in 1790 to systematize martial arts, incorporating pyeongon techniques among six new equestrian disciplines to counter northern threats like the Jurchens.[^44]

### Social and Administrative Reforms

King Jeongjo spearheaded bold social initiatives, opening government positions to those who would previously have been barred because of their social status.[^45] This lifting of restrictions on government positions allowed individuals from various social statuses to serve, fundamentally challenging the rigid class hierarchy of Joseon society.[^46] The political system underwent a series of reforms aimed at strengthening central authority by implementing administrative reforms and combating corruption.[^47]

During his reign, the country had largely recovered from the destruction of previous wars, agriculture was prosperous with increased use of irrigation, and a monetary economy was burgeoning.[^48] Jeongjo was deeply concerned about continuing outbreaks of measles epidemics and, among other initiatives, supplied free public medicines in an attempt to curb death rates.[^49] During a severe drought in his second year, he performed a special ritual to pray for rain, demonstrating his deep care for his people's welfare.[^50]

### Cultural and Literary Achievements

During King Jeongjo's reign, the Joseon Dynasty enjoyed relative political stability and economic prosperity that set the stage for various cultural and artistic achievements.[^51] Jeongjo himself was a prolific writer—his poems, royal messages, orders, and other writings were collected and published in 1814 as the "Complete Writings of King Jeongjo," including works like 'Gyeongsagangui' (discussions with vassals), 'Simrirok' (judicial precedents), 'Ildeungrok' (quotations of Jeongjo), and 'Gunseopyogi' (explanatory book of Jeongjo's writings).[^52]

The king would sometimes hold poetry sessions with his subordinates as an act of harmonious communication, especially enjoying this practice with close associates at the Gyujanggak library, exchanging poem composition in the form of verse couplets.[^53] Like most scholarly elites of his era, Joseon kings were not only conversant in Neo-Confucian philosophy but were also cultured literati with excellent literary and calligraphic skills.[^54]

Master court painters such as Kim Hong-do (born 1745) rose to become leading artists of the era, ushering in an exciting period of stylistic achievements and innovations, including the introduction of Western painting techniques.[^55] His reign also saw the further growth and development of Joseon's popular culture.[^56]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Ideological Limitations and Reform Constraints

Despite his reputation as a reformer, King Jeongjo faced significant criticisms regarding the limitations of his reforms. Modern scholars argue that his scholarship and ideological control adversely affected Joseon's Enlightenment.[^57] He was both intellectually gifted and practically skilled, but fundamentally, he was a Confucian scholar before being a reform monarch.[^58] This ideological constraint meant that even when he desired reform, he couldn't fully implement it due to his own commitment to Neo-Confucian orthodoxy and the political realities surrounding his legitimacy.[^59]

The national operating system built by Jeongjo has been criticized as containing the seeds of Joseon's eventual decline because it was a system full of contradictions.[^60] While he promoted practical learning through Silhak scholars, he simultaneously maintained strict Neo-Confucian orthodoxy. He was opposed to new fashions in the composition style of Korean writing and personally taught composition to some intellectuals and bureaucrats in a movement called Munchebanjong, attempting to preserve traditional literary forms.[^61]

### Failed Political Balance

Jeongjo's ambitious Tangpyeong policy of political balance ultimately failed to achieve lasting stability. While he appointed members from several political factions, they divided again into two camps—the Byeok faction and the Shi faction—due to the ongoing issue of Crown Prince Sado's vindication.[^62] After King Jeongjo's sudden death, Tangpyeong politics became completely useless as factional struggles immediately intensified.[^63] His reign marked a cultural and political renaissance, but factional struggles persisted throughout and intensified after his death.[^64]

### Catholic Persecution

One of the most controversial aspects of Jeongjo's reign was his handling of Catholicism. In 1787, King Jeongjo officially outlawed Catholicism as an "evil practice," declaring it heretical and strictly banned.[^65] Even before major persecutions, some Confucian students filed appeals claiming that "Catholic doctrine is contrary to Joseon's Neo-Confucian ideology," and the government banned the import of Catholic books.[^66]

Jeongjo's stance on Catholicism was politically complicated. From his perspective, it was a religion that opponents used to attack his close associates, yet if he completely suppressed it, his ideals of political harmony would disappear. If he took a positive interest in Catholicism, he could be seen as denying Joseon's order based on Neo-Confucianism—a truly embarrassing situation for a king.[^67] In the end, during the Jinsan Incident of 1791, Jeongjo backed the Noron faction's push to oppress Catholicism and ordered the arrest, conviction, and execution of Catholics Yun and Kwon, who were beheaded on December 8, 1791.[^68]

### Kyujanggak Power Concentration

While Kyujanggak was initially established as a center for scholarship and reform, critics argue that it later became a very large power organization that concentrated influence in ways that may have undermined broader governmental balance.[^69] This concentration of power in a royal institution, while strengthening the king's hand against factions, also created its own structural problems for governance.

## Personal Life

### Family and Marriage

King Jeongjo married Queen Hyoui of the Cheongpung Kim clan in 1762 at the age of 9, when he was still known as Yi San.[^70] She became queen consort upon her husband's accession to the throne in 1776.[^71] Despite their long marriage, Queen Hyoui did not bear King Jeongjo any children, but she adopted the sons of two of her husband's concubines, Royal Noble Consort Ui and Royal Noble Consort Su, as her own.[^72] Following Korean royal tradition, Jeongjo is buried with his wife, Queen Hyoui, at the royal tomb of Geonneung in the city of Hwaseong.[^73]

### Royal Consorts and Children

King Jeongjo's most beloved consort was Royal Noble Consort Ui (Uibin Seong) of the Changnyeong Seong clan.[^74] Their relationship became famous through Korean historical dramas and was marked by genuine affection. On March 20, 1784, Lady Seong gave birth to an unnamed daughter who tragically died a year after birth.[^75] On July 2, 1784, their son Yi Sun was invested as Crown Prince, but he died during an epidemic on June 6, 1786, at just two years old.[^76] This loss devastated both parents. Four months after the death of her son, Seong Ui-bin died of disease during the last month of her fifth pregnancy, leaving Jeongjo heartbroken.[^77]

Royal Noble Consort Su (Subin Park) of the Bannam Park clan gave birth to Crown Prince Yi Gong on July 29, 1790, who would eventually succeed Jeongjo on the throne as King Sunjo.[^78] The king also had Royal Noble Consort Hwa of the Namwon Yun clan, who had no children.[^79]

### Personality and Character

King Jeongjo was known to be studious, deeply intellectual, and profoundly committed to filial piety.[^80] His personality was shaped by the trauma of witnessing his father's execution and the constant political threats he faced throughout his youth. He demonstrated remarkable emotional intelligence in navigating the treacherous factional politics of his era while maintaining his vision for reform.

One notable quote attributed to him reflects his educational philosophy: "Who is to say that education comes solely from books? The most important education comes from the family."[^81] This statement aligned with his well-documented commitment to education and reform, as well as his deep filial devotion to honoring his father's memory.

### The 1795 Royal Procession

One of the most magnificent personal and political events of Jeongjo's reign was the grand royal procession to Hwaseong in 1795. The journey took place over eight days, from the 9th to the 16th day of the 2nd lunar month in 1795, to commemorate the 60th birthday of his mother, Queen Heongyeong.[^82] King Jeongjo traveled from Changdeok Palace in the capital through Suwon Hwaseong Fortress to Yungneung, where his father Crown Prince Sado was buried.[^83]

This was the largest royal parade in Korea's history, drawing more than 6,000 participants, including 115 musicians who played various instruments as they rode on horseback.[^84] The procession was implemented as a large-scale national event to strengthen the king's power and authority, listen to the voices of the people, and inspect Hwaseong Fortress, which was under construction.[^85] Upon returning from Hwaseong, Jeongjo compiled the Wonhaeng eulmyo jeongni uigwe (State Record on King Jeongjo's Visit to the Tomb of Crown Prince Sado in 1795), which recorded the details of the visit along with banchado illustrations of the royal procession and major scenes of the royal event.[^86]

## Legacy

King Jeongjo's sudden death in 1800 at the age of 47 left many of his initiatives unfulfilled, including his plan to relocate the capital from Seoul to Suwon.[^87] However, his reign is remembered as one of the highest points of the Joseon era, and today he is generally considered to be among the greatest leaders in Korean history.[^88]

The Hwaseong Fortress stands as his most enduring physical legacy, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997.[^89] The fortress has had a profound influence on the development of Korean architecture, urban planning, and landscaping and related arts.[^90] Modern reenactments of his 1795 royal procession have continued since 1996, celebrating the 200th anniversary of the fortress and keeping his memory alive in contemporary Korean culture.[^91]

Jeongjo's promotion of Silhak (Practical Learning) scholars and his establishment of Kyujanggak created an intellectual legacy that influenced Korean scholarship for generations.[^92] His efforts to break down social barriers by appointing talented individuals regardless of their birth status represented a progressive vision that was far ahead of his time.[^93]

His filial devotion to vindicating his father's memory has become legendary in Korean culture. In 1789, he moved his father's body to its current location, and five years later, the Hwaseong Fortress was built specifically to memorialize and honor his father's tomb.[^94] This dedication to filial piety while simultaneously pursuing political reform made him a unique figure in Korean history—a Confucian exemplar who honored tradition while pushing for modernization.

The era of Jeongjo's rule produced significant cultural and social progress compared with any other pre-modern Korean era, rivaling even the celebrated reign of King Sejong.[^95] His support for the arts led to masterworks by painters like Kim Hong-do and advancements in literature, poetry, and scholarship that enriched Korean cultural heritage.[^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

The scholarly evaluation of King Jeongjo has undergone dramatic transformation over recent decades. While scholarship in the 1970s generally regarded Jeongjo's reign as largely a failure, he received scholarly rehabilitation in the 1990s, transforming from "the dullard, the useless monarch who failed to prepare the country for modernization" to "Jeongjo the Great, Confucian enlightened despot."[^97]

Scholar Kim Paek-chŏl connects this scholarly shift to conditions in contemporary South Korea, namely the longing for desperately needed reforms and the failure to achieve them, which mirrored the King's reform-mindedness and tragically short life.[^98] Interestingly, the 1980s negative view of Jeongjo stood in contrast to the view of the king's near-contemporaries in the nineteenth century, who looked at his reign as a dynastic high point.[^99]

He is now regarded as one of the most successful and visionary rulers of Joseon, equivalent to King Sejong.[^100] Professor Park Kwang-yong noted that "during the era of King Jeongjo, there was much cultural and social progress compared with any other pre-modern society eras, along with the era of King Sejong."[^101] An exhibition highlighting King Jeongjo and his legacy demonstrated the continued scholarly and popular interest in his reign and accomplishments.[^102]

Modern historians praise his establishment of the Kyujanggak royal library, his expansion of social mobility, his encouragement of Neo-Confucian scholarship balanced with practical learning, and his success in creating a cultural and political renaissance during his reign.[^103] His benevolent approach to the construction of Hwaseong Fortress, paying workers fair wages instead of using forced labor, is seen as progressive and humane governance.[^104]

### Negative Views

Despite the positive reassessment, critical scholars maintain significant reservations about Jeongjo's reign. The fundamental critique is that while he was reform-minded, he remained constrained by his own Neo-Confucian orthodoxy and was unable or unwilling to challenge the fundamental structures that would eventually lead to Joseon's decline.[^105]

Critics argue that his scholarship and ideological control actually hindered rather than helped Joseon's necessary transformation toward modernization.[^106] His opposition to new literary styles and his insistence on traditional Confucian forms through the Munchebanjong movement demonstrated a conservative streak that contradicted his reformist image.[^107]

The failure of his Tangpyeong policy is seen as evidence that his political philosophy was ultimately ineffective. The factions he tried to balance simply reorganized themselves around new dividing lines, and immediately after his death, factional conflict exploded with even greater intensity.[^108] Some historians argue that his concentration of power in Kyujanggak and his military reforms through Jangyongyeong merely created new power centers rather than solving systemic problems.[^109]

His persecution of Catholics, culminating in the executions of 1791, is viewed by many historians as a moral failure and a capitulation to conservative forces that undermined his claims to enlightened governance.[^110] While he faced genuine political constraints, his decision to execute Catholics contradicted his stated ideals of political harmony and tolerance.

The national operating system he built has been characterized as "a system full of contradictions" that contained the first steps toward the destruction of Joseon.[^111] Rather than fundamentally reforming the kingdom, some scholars argue that Jeongjo merely prolonged an unsustainable system, making the eventual collapse more catastrophic when it finally came.
