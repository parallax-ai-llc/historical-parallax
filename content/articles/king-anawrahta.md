## Summary

King Anawrahta (1014-1077) was the founder of the Pagan Empire in what is now Myanmar, reigning from 1044 to 1077. He is credited with unifying the various regions of Burma under a single kingdom and introducing Theravada Buddhism as the dominant religion, fundamentally transforming the cultural and religious landscape of Southeast Asia. Through military conquest, diplomatic marriages, and religious reform, Anawrahta established Pagan as a major regional power and laid the foundations for Burmese national identity. His reign marked the beginning of the Pagan Dynasty's golden age, during which thousands of Buddhist temples and pagodas were constructed. Despite controversies surrounding his military campaigns and forced religious conversions, he remains one of Myanmar's most revered historical figures.

## Early Life and Background

Anawrahta was born in 1014 CE in the region of Pagan (also known as Bagan) in central Burma, during a period of significant political fragmentation and regional conflict[^1]. His birth name was Min Saw, and he was the son of King Kunhsaw Kyaunghpyu, who ruled Pagan as a relatively minor principality along the Irrawaddy River[^2]. The political landscape of 11th-century Burma was characterized by competing kingdoms, including the Mon kingdoms in the south, the Pyu city-states in decline, and various Bamar (Burmese) chiefdoms in the central dry zone[^3].

According to traditional chronicles, Anawrahta's early life was marked by adversity and political intrigue. When his father was overthrown by his half-brother Sokkate in 1021, the young Anawrahta was forced into obscurity[^4]. He spent his formative years away from the royal court, growing up among commoners and learning the martial skills that would later serve him in his military campaigns[^5]. These experiences, according to Burmese chronicles, instilled in him a sense of resilience and an understanding of the common people that would characterize his later rule[^6].

The chronicles describe Anawrahta as possessing exceptional physical strength and martial prowess from a young age. Legend has it that he could draw a bow that no other man could string and demonstrated remarkable skill in combat[^7]. While these accounts contain mythological elements typical of royal chronicles, they reflect the importance of military capability in the political culture of medieval Burma[^8]. Historical sources suggest that Anawrahta received some education in Buddhist texts and Sanskrit, which was uncommon for someone not raised at court, indicating that he may have maintained some connections to educated monks or former courtiers during his years away from power[^9].

---

## Rise to Power

Anawrahta's path to the throne began in 1044 when he challenged his half-brother Sokkate to single combat for control of Pagan[^10]. According to the chronicles, this challenge was precipitated by Sokkate's inappropriate behavior toward Anawrahta's wife, though political ambition was likely the primary motivation[^11]. In the duel, Anawrahta defeated and killed Sokkate, claiming the throne at the age of thirty[^12]. This dramatic seizure of power marked the beginning of one of the most transformative reigns in Southeast Asian history[^13].

Upon assuming the throne, Anawrahta faced a kingdom that was small, poor, and threatened by more powerful neighbors[^14]. Pagan controlled only a limited territory around the central dry zone of Burma, surrounded by the Mon kingdoms of Thaton and Pegu to the south, the Shan states to the east, and the Arakanese kingdom to the west[^15]. Anawrahta immediately set about consolidating his power base, reforming the military, and establishing alliances through diplomatic marriages and tributary relationships[^16].

A pivotal moment in Anawrahta's rise came with his encounter with Shin Arahan, a Mon monk from Thaton who introduced him to Theravada Buddhism[^17]. Prior to this, the dominant religious practices in Pagan included Mahayana Buddhism, Tantric Buddhism, and various animist traditions known as nat worship[^18]. Shin Arahan convinced Anawrahta that Theravada Buddhism, with its emphasis on monastic discipline and scriptural authority, was the purest form of Buddhist practice[^19]. This religious conversion would become the ideological foundation for Anawrahta's imperial expansion and his claim to legitimate rule over neighboring Buddhist kingdoms[^20].

Between 1044 and 1057, Anawrahta systematically expanded his territory through a combination of military conquest and diplomatic submission[^21]. He subjugated the various Bamar chiefdoms in the central dry zone, bringing them under direct Pagan control[^22]. He established tributary relationships with the Shan states to the northeast and launched campaigns against the Arakanese kingdom[^23]. These early conquests provided Anawrahta with the resources and manpower necessary for his most ambitious undertaking: the conquest of the Mon kingdom of Thaton[^24].

---

## Major Achievements

Anawrahta's most significant achievement was the conquest of the Mon kingdom of Thaton in 1057, which transformed Pagan from a minor principality into the dominant power in Burma[^25]. According to traditional accounts, Anawrahta requested Buddhist scriptures from King Manuha of Thaton, and when his request was refused, he launched a military campaign to seize them by force[^26]. The conquest of Thaton brought not only territory and tribute but also enormous cultural wealth: Buddhist scriptures, relics, monks, artisans, and educated Mon elites were brought back to Pagan[^27]. This influx of Mon culture and Buddhist learning catalyzed a cultural renaissance in Pagan that would define the empire for centuries[^28].

The establishment of Theravada Buddhism as the state religion was perhaps Anawrahta's most enduring legacy[^29]. He systematically promoted Theravada Buddhism throughout his empire, building temples and monasteries, supporting the Sangha (monastic community), and suppressing other religious practices that he deemed heretical[^30]. While he could not completely eliminate the popular worship of nats (spirits), he incorporated them into Buddhist practice by designating them as protectors of Buddhism subordinate to the Buddha[^31]. This religious unification provided ideological cohesion to his diverse empire and established a pattern that would characterize Burmese kingdoms for centuries[^32].

Anawrahta's building program was extraordinary in its scale and ambition. During his reign, he initiated the construction of numerous temples, pagodas, and monasteries that transformed Pagan into one of the great religious centers of Southeast Asia[^33]. The Shwezigon Pagoda, begun by Anawrahta and completed by his son, became one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Burma[^34]. The Shwesandaw Pagoda, built to house sacred Buddha relics, demonstrated advanced architectural techniques and established design principles that influenced Burmese temple architecture for generations[^35]. Archaeological evidence suggests that the pace of temple construction accelerated dramatically during Anawrahta's reign, reflecting both increased resources from conquest and his religious devotion[^36].

Military innovation was central to Anawrahta's success. He reorganized the Pagan army along more professional lines, incorporating Mon military techniques and equipment[^37]. He developed an effective cavalry force, crucial for operations in the dry zone, and improved siege warfare capabilities[^38]. His military reforms included establishing a system of military service obligations for various regions and social groups, creating a standing army that could be mobilized for extended campaigns[^39]. These innovations gave Pagan a decisive military advantage over its neighbors and enabled Anawrahta to project power across a wide geographic area[^40].

Anawrahta's diplomatic achievements extended beyond conquest. He established tributary relationships with numerous kingdoms and principalities, creating a regional system with Pagan at its center[^41]. He reportedly sent missions to Sri Lanka, the source of Theravada Buddhist orthodoxy, and received in return relics and recognition of his status as a Buddhist king[^42]. He also established diplomatic contact with the Khmer Empire to the east and may have had relations with China, though the historical record on this is unclear[^43]. These diplomatic connections enhanced Pagan's prestige and integrated it into wider Asian trade and cultural networks[^44].

Infrastructure development under Anawrahta laid the economic foundations for Pagan's prosperity. He constructed irrigation systems in the central dry zone, expanding agricultural productivity and supporting population growth[^45]. He improved roads and established rest houses for travelers, facilitating trade and administration[^46]. He standardized weights and measures and may have introduced coinage, though the extent of monetization during his reign is debated among historians[^47]. These economic reforms created the surplus wealth that funded his building programs and military campaigns[^48].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revered status in Burmese history, Anawrahta's reign was marked by violence and religious intolerance that has drawn criticism from modern historians[^49]. The conquest of Thaton, in particular, involved significant brutality, with the Mon royal family and elite being forcibly relocated to Pagan as captives[^50]. While the chronicles present this as a necessary act to obtain Buddhist scriptures, modern scholars note that it was primarily a war of conquest motivated by economic and political considerations[^51]. The treatment of King Manuha of Thaton, who was held in humiliating captivity in Pagan, illustrates the harsh realities of Anawrahta's imperial expansion[^52].

Anawrahta's religious policies involved systematic suppression of religious practices he deemed heterodox[^53]. He persecuted followers of Mahayana Buddhism and Tantric Buddhism, destroying their temples and forcibly converting or exiling their practitioners[^54]. While he could not eliminate nat worship due to its deep roots in popular culture, his attempts to subordinate it to Buddhism involved coercion and the destruction of traditional religious sites[^55]. Modern scholars have noted that this religious intolerance, while effective in creating cultural unity, came at the cost of religious diversity and involved significant violence against religious minorities[^56].

The social costs of Anawrahta's building program have also drawn scrutiny. The construction of thousands of temples and irrigation works required enormous labor inputs, which were provided through corvée labor obligations imposed on the peasantry[^57]. While temple construction was presented as religiously meritorious, the burden on rural communities was substantial, involving months of labor away from agricultural production[^58]. Some scholars have argued that this building program, while creating impressive monuments, may have strained the economic resources of the kingdom and contributed to social tensions[^59].

Anawrahta's military campaigns involved significant human costs beyond the casualties of battle. His wars of expansion resulted in population displacement, enslavement of captives, and the destruction of competing political centers[^60]. The incorporation of diverse ethnic groups into his empire was achieved through force rather than consensus, creating tensions that would periodically erupt into rebellion[^61]. The chronicles' triumphalist narrative of conquest obscures the perspectives of those who resisted Pagan's expansion and lost their independence[^62].

Historians have also questioned the extent to which Anawrahta's reforms actually reached the common people versus serving elite interests[^63]. While he is credited with spreading Theravada Buddhism, the sophisticated textual Buddhism promoted at court remained largely inaccessible to illiterate peasants[^64]. The magnificent temples were built for royal merit-making and reflected the interests of the elite, while ordinary people continued to practice syncretic forms of Buddhism mixed with spirit worship[^65]. Some scholars argue that Anawrahta's religious reforms primarily served to legitimize royal authority rather than representing genuine spiritual transformation[^66].

---

## Personal Life

Anawrahta's personal life, like that of most medieval rulers, is documented primarily through chronicles that mix historical fact with legend[^67]. He had multiple wives, following the polygamous practices common among Southeast Asian royalty[^68]. His chief queen was Saw Mon Hla, who bore him his successor Saw Lu[^69]. He also married several princesses from conquered or tributary kingdoms, using marriage alliances to consolidate his political control[^70]. These diplomatic marriages were standard practice for empire-building monarchs, creating kinship ties that reinforced political subordination[^71].

The chronicles portray Anawrahta as personally devout, spending considerable time in meditation and Buddhist study[^72]. He reportedly maintained close relationships with several prominent monks, including his spiritual advisor Shin Arahan, consulting them on both religious and political matters[^73]. His personal religiosity appears to have been genuine, though it also served political purposes by demonstrating his fitness to rule as a Buddhist king[^74]. The frequency with which he engaged in temple building and religious donations suggests that accumulating spiritual merit was a central preoccupation of his later years[^75].

Contemporary sources describe Anawrahta as physically imposing and charismatic, qualities that enhanced his authority in a political culture that valued martial prowess[^76]. The chronicles emphasize his personal bravery, claiming he often led troops into battle personally[^77]. While such accounts should be treated cautiously, they reflect the importance of personal military leadership for maintaining the loyalty of warrior elites[^78]. His reputation for physical strength and combat skill was evidently important to his political legitimacy[^79].

Anawrahta's character, as presented in the chronicles, combined religious devotion with ruthless pragmatism[^80]. He could be generous to those who submitted to his authority but was merciless toward those who resisted[^81]. This combination of incentives and threats was characteristic of successful medieval empire-builders[^82]. The chronicles also suggest he was personally accessible to subjects seeking justice, maintaining the Southeast Asian tradition of royal audience where commoners could petition the king[^83]. Whether this reflects historical reality or idealized kingship is difficult to determine, but it indicates the values that later generations believed good rulers should embody[^84].

## Legacy

Anawrahta's legacy as the founder of the first unified Burmese kingdom has profoundly shaped Myanmar's national identity[^85]. He is remembered as the king who brought the Burmese people together under one rule and established Buddhism as the defining feature of Burmese civilization[^86]. This narrative of Anawrahta as national unifier has been invoked by successive Burmese governments, from the Konbaung Dynasty to modern military regimes, to legitimize centralized authority and Buddhist nationalism[^87]. His status as a culture hero means that his historical reputation remains entangled with contemporary political debates about national identity, religious authority, and ethnic relations[^88].

The Pagan Empire that Anawrahta founded lasted until 1287, when it collapsed under the pressure of Mongol invasions[^89]. However, his political and religious legacy endured. Subsequent Burmese kingdoms, including the Ava, Toungoo, and Konbaung dynasties, all looked back to Anawrahta and the Pagan period as a golden age and model for legitimate Buddhist kingship[^90]. The concept of the king as defender and promoter of Buddhism, which Anawrahta exemplified, became the foundation of Burmese political culture[^91]. This religious-political ideology persisted until the British colonial conquest in the 19th century and continues to influence Myanmar politics today[^92].

The architectural legacy of Anawrahta's reign remains visible in the thousands of temples and pagodas that dot the Pagan plain[^93]. The Pagan Archaeological Zone, with over 2,200 remaining structures from the Pagan period, was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2019[^94]. Many of the most important temples, including those initiated by Anawrahta, remain active pilgrimage sites and sources of national pride[^95]. The distinctive Pagan architectural style, characterized by tiered terraces leading to a central spire, influenced temple construction throughout mainland Southeast Asia[^96].

Anawrahta's establishment of Theravada Buddhism as Burma's dominant religion proved to be his most enduring legacy[^97]. Myanmar remains one of the most predominantly Buddhist countries in the world, with approximately 88% of the population identifying as Buddhist[^98]. The monastic institutions that Anawrahta strengthened remain influential in Burmese society, playing important roles in education, social welfare, and political activism[^99]. The integration of nat worship into Buddhist practice, which Anawrahta initiated, created a distinctively Burmese form of Buddhism that persists today[^100].

In regional terms, Anawrahta's reign marked a shift in the balance of power in mainland Southeast Asia[^101]. The rise of Pagan as a major power altered trade routes, diplomatic relationships, and cultural exchanges across the region[^102]. The spread of Theravada Buddhism from Pagan influenced the religious development of neighboring kingdoms, including Thailand and Laos[^103]. The Mon people, despite their military defeat, exerted profound cultural influence on the Pagan Empire, and Mon artistic and literary traditions continued to shape Burmese culture for centuries[^104].

Modern Myanmar's relationship with Anawrahta's legacy is complex and sometimes contested[^105]. While he is celebrated as a national hero in mainstream Burmese historiography, ethnic minorities, particularly the Mon, have more ambivalent views of a king who conquered their ancestors and subjugated their kingdoms[^106]. Contemporary debates about Buddhist nationalism, military rule, and ethnic conflicts in Myanmar often invoke or contest narratives about Anawrahta and the Pagan period[^107]. His legacy thus remains politically relevant nearly a millennium after his death[^108].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Traditional Burmese historiography has consistently portrayed Anawrahta as one of the greatest kings in the nation's history, a perspective that has been reinforced by nationalist historians since independence[^109]. Burmese scholars emphasize his role in creating a unified Burmese state from fragmented principalities, arguing that without his military and political genius, Myanmar as a unified nation might never have emerged[^110]. Historian Than Tun, one of Myanmar's most prominent scholars, praised Anawrahta for establishing "the foundations of Burmese civilization" through his political and religious reforms[^111].

Western scholars have also recognized Anawrahta's historical significance, with G.E. Harvey, author of the influential "History of Burma," describing him as "the most important figure in Burmese history"[^112]. Harvey and subsequent historians have noted that Anawrahta's achievement in transforming a minor principality into a regional empire demonstrated exceptional political and military skill[^113]. His ability to incorporate diverse ethnic groups and regions into a functioning political system, while maintaining stability for over three decades, indicates considerable administrative capability[^114].

Religious historians have praised Anawrahta's role in establishing Theravada Buddhism in Southeast Asia. Donald Swearer, a leading scholar of Southeast Asian Buddhism, has argued that Anawrahta's religious reforms created "the template for Buddhist kingship" that influenced the entire region[^115]. By connecting Burmese Buddhism to the prestigious Theravada tradition of Sri Lanka and by supporting the monastic community, Anawrahta established institutional frameworks that allowed Buddhism to flourish[^116]. His synthesis of Buddhism with indigenous spirit worship, rather than attempting complete suppression, showed pragmatic wisdom in adapting foreign religion to local culture[^117].

Art historians have consistently praised the cultural flowering that began under Anawrahta's patronage[^118]. The architectural achievements of the Pagan period, which he initiated, represent one of the great artistic traditions of Southeast Asia[^119]. Pierre Pichard, who conducted extensive archaeological surveys of Pagan, has emphasized how Anawrahta's patronage created conditions for artistic innovation and the development of distinctive Burmese aesthetic traditions[^120]. The temples built during his reign show sophisticated engineering knowledge and artistic refinement that places them among the great architectural achievements of medieval Asia[^121].

Some scholars have emphasized Anawrahta's relatively enlightened governance compared to many medieval rulers[^122]. His reported concern for irrigation and agricultural improvement showed attention to the welfare of ordinary subjects[^123]. His maintenance of justice through personal audience, if historically accurate, represented a form of accessible governance unusual for the period[^124]. Historian Michael Aung-Thwin has argued that Anawrahta's creation of stable institutions, rather than a system dependent on personal rule, allowed the Pagan Empire to thrive for over two centuries after his death[^125].

### Negative Views

Revisionist historians have challenged the heroic narrative of Anawrahta, pointing out that much of what we know about him comes from chronicles written centuries after his death for the purpose of legitimizing later dynasties[^126]. Victor Lieberman has argued that the extent of Anawrahta's conquests and reforms may have been exaggerated by later chroniclers, with subsequent kings receiving credit for their own achievements attributed to the legendary founder[^127]. The historical Anawrahta may have been a successful local ruler whose accomplishments were amplified by later myth-making[^128].

Critics have emphasized the violence and intolerance that characterized Anawrahta's reign[^129]. His conquest of Thaton involved the destruction of a sophisticated Mon civilization and the enslavement of its elite[^130]. His religious policies, far from representing enlightened reform, involved the persecution of religious minorities and the forced conversion of populations to his preferred form of Buddhism[^131]. From this perspective, Anawrahta appears less as a unifier and more as a conqueror who imposed his will through force[^132].

Mon historians and scholars have offered alternative perspectives that challenge Anawrahta's heroic status[^133]. They point out that Mon civilization was more advanced than Pagan civilization before the conquest of Thaton, and that much of what is praised as Anawrahta's cultural achievement actually represented the forced appropriation of Mon culture[^134]. The Mon people lost their political independence and much of their cultural distinctiveness as a result of Anawrahta's conquests, a historical trauma that continues to affect Mon ethnic identity[^135]. From this perspective, Anawrahta's legacy is one of cultural imperialism rather than enlightened nation-building[^136].

Some scholars have questioned the economic sustainability of Anawrahta's building program and military expansion[^137]. Michael Aung-Thwin has suggested that the enormous resource demands of temple construction may have contributed to economic strain and eventual political instability[^138]. The corvée labor system, while enabling impressive monuments, imposed heavy burdens on agricultural communities and may have hindered economic development[^139]. This critique suggests that Anawrahta's legacy includes not only impressive temples but also structural economic weaknesses that contributed to Pagan's eventual decline[^140].

Postcolonial scholars have noted how Anawrahta's legacy has been instrumentalized by modern authoritarian regimes in Myanmar to justify Buddhist nationalism and military rule[^141]. The narrative of Anawrahta as strong king who unified the nation through military power and religious authority has been invoked by Myanmar's military governments to legitimize their own rule[^142]. This has made critical historical assessment of Anawrahta politically sensitive, as questioning the legendary king can be portrayed as unpatriotic[^143]. Some scholars argue that uncritical celebration of Anawrahta's legacy contributes to contemporary problems of ethnic conflict and religious intolerance in Myanmar[^144].
