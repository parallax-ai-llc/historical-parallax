## Summary

Huangbo Xiyun was a Chinese Chan master famous for his teaching of 'One Mind' — that all beings share a single universal mind which is Buddha. He was the teacher of Linji Yixuan and his teachings are preserved in the 'Essential Dharma of Mind Transmission.' His striking of students to provoke awakening became a hallmark of the Linji school. His philosophy simplified Chan into a direct pointing at the mind's true nature.
