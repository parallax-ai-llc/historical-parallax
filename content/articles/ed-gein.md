## Summary
Edward Theodore Gein was an American murderer and body snatcher whose crimes in 1950s Wisconsin gained widespread notoriety. He was confirmed to have murdered two women but exhumed corpses to fashion items from bones and skin. His crimes inspired Norman Bates, Leatherface, and Buffalo Bill in fiction.

## Early Life
Born August 27, 1906, in La Crosse County, Wisconsin. His mother Augusta was a domineering, fanatically religious woman. His father was an alcoholic. After his family died, Gein lived alone on the farm, becoming reclusive with an obsessive interest in female anatomy. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Gein murdered tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and hardware store owner Bernice Worden in 1957. He also robbed graves, creating macabre items from human remains including furniture, bowls from skulls, and a suit of female skin. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
When Worden disappeared on November 16, 1957, a receipt led police to Gein's farm. They found her body and numerous human remain artifacts. He confessed, was found mentally incompetent in 1957, tried in 1968 and found guilty but legally insane. He died in an institution on July 26, 1984. [^3]
