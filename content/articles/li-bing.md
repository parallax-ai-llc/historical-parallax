## Summary

Li Bing was an ancient Chinese hydraulic engineer who designed and built the Dujiangyan irrigation system around 256 BC, one of the greatest feats of engineering in the ancient world. Still in use today after over 2,200 years, this system tamed the Min River floods and irrigated the Chengdu Plain, turning Sichuan into China's most productive agricultural region.
