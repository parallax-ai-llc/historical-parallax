## Summary

Al-Ghazali (1058-1111), known as Hujjat al-Islam (Proof of Islam), was one of the most influential Muslim scholars in history, whose works profoundly shaped Islamic theology, philosophy, jurisprudence, and mysticism.[^1] Born in Tus, Persia, he rose to become the most prestigious professor at the Nizamiyya Madrasa in Baghdad before experiencing a spiritual crisis that led him to abandon his position in 1095.[^2] His magnum opus, *Ihya' 'ulum ad-din* (The Revival of the Religious Sciences), successfully integrated Sufism into orthodox Sunni Islam, while his *Tahafut al-Falasifa* (The Incoherence of the Philosophers) mounted a devastating critique of Aristotelian philosophy that reverberated through both Islamic and Christian medieval thought.[^3] His influence extended beyond the Islamic world to Christian scholastics like Thomas Aquinas and Jewish philosophers, making him a towering figure in medieval philosophy.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Abu Hamid Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Ghazali was born in 1058 CE (450 AH) in the town of Tabaran in the district of Tus, located in the Khorasan province of Persia (present-day Iran).[^5] His father, though of modest means, was deeply pious and worked as a wool spinner (ghazzal, from which the family name derives).[^6] Before his death, al-Ghazali's father entrusted his two sons, Muhammad and Ahmad, to the care of a Sufi friend, ensuring they would receive proper Islamic education despite the family's poverty.[^7]

Orphaned at a young age, al-Ghazali and his younger brother Ahmad initially studied with local teachers in Tus.[^8] Al-Ghazali's exceptional intellectual gifts became apparent early, and he soon moved to Jurjan (near the Caspian Sea) to study Islamic jurisprudence under Imam Abu Nasr Ismaeli.[^9] However, the defining moment of his educational journey came when he was nineteen years old and gained admission to the prestigious Nizamiyya Madrasa in Nishapur, approximately fifty miles west of Tus.[^10]

At Nishapur, al-Ghazali became a student of the distinguished theologian and jurist Imam al-Haramayn Abu'l-Ma'ali al-Juwayni (1028-1085), one of the leading scholars of the Ash'arite school of theology and the Shafi'i school of jurisprudence.[^11] Under al-Juwayni's tutelage, al-Ghazali mastered Islamic law (fiqh), theology (kalam), logic, and the principles of jurisprudence (usul al-fiqh).[^12] Al-Juwayni recognized his student's brilliance and reportedly called him "a vast ocean of knowledge."[^13] During this formative period, al-Ghazali also studied philosophy, particularly the works of al-Farabi and Avicenna (Ibn Sina), though he would later note in his autobiography that he was more ambitious than religious as a young man, pursuing a scholarly religious path primarily because it was what was available to someone with little money or family standing.[^14]

---

## Rise to Power

After al-Juwayni's death in 1085, al-Ghazali was invited to the court of Nizam al-Mulk, the powerful vizier of the Seljuq sultans.[^15] Nizam al-Mulk had established a network of madrasas throughout the Islamic world to promote orthodox Sunni Islam and counter the influence of Shi'ite theology.[^16] Recognizing al-Ghazali's extraordinary abilities, the vizier brought him into his intellectual circle, where the young scholar engaged in debates and discussions with other prominent thinkers of the age.[^17]

In 1091, at the age of thirty-three, al-Ghazali received the most prestigious academic appointment in the Muslim world when Nizam al-Mulk appointed him chief professor at the Nizamiyya Madrasa in Baghdad.[^18] This appointment placed him at the intellectual center of the Islamic empire, teaching at the institution that was considered the Harvard or Oxford of its time.[^19] Baghdad was not only the political capital of the Abbasid Caliphate but also its cultural and scholarly heart, attracting students and scholars from across the Islamic world.[^20]

At the Nizamiyya, al-Ghazali lectured to more than three hundred students, establishing himself as the undisputed authority on Islamic jurisprudence and theology.[^21] His lectures were renowned for their brilliance, and students traveled from distant lands to study under him.[^22] During this period, he also served as an adviser to caliphs and sultans, wielding considerable political as well as intellectual influence.[^23] Al-Ghazali was at the pinnacle of worldly success, enjoying wealth, prestige, and the admiration of the entire Islamic world.[^24]

While maintaining his teaching responsibilities, al-Ghazali devoted himself to a comprehensive study of philosophy, particularly the Neoplatonist philosophies of al-Farabi and Avicenna.[^25] He mastered their systems so thoroughly that he wrote *Maqasid al-Falasifa* (The Aims of the Philosophers), an objective exposition of their doctrines that was so clear and comprehensive that some readers mistakenly thought he endorsed these philosophical positions.[^26] This deep understanding of philosophy was preparation for his devastating critique that would follow.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Al-Ghazali's intellectual achievements span multiple disciplines and have had an enduring impact on Islamic civilization and beyond. His scholarly output was prodigious, producing over seventy books written in both Arabic and Persian.[^28]

### Integration of Sufism into Orthodox Islam

Perhaps al-Ghazali's most significant achievement was making Sufism (Islamic mysticism) an acceptable and integral part of orthodox Sunni Islam.[^29] Before al-Ghazali, Sufism was often viewed with suspicion by orthodox scholars, who feared its emphasis on direct mystical experience might lead to antinomianism or heterodoxy.[^30] His magnum opus, *Ihya' 'ulum ad-din* (The Revival of the Religious Sciences), systematically integrated Sufi spirituality with Islamic law and theology, showing how mystical practice could deepen rather than contradict orthodox belief.[^31]

The *Ihya'* is an encyclopedic work divided into four quarters, each containing ten books, covering virtually every aspect of Muslim life from ritual purification to the remembrance of death.[^32] It became the most frequently recited Islamic text after the Qur'an and hadith, achieving the remarkable feat of bringing orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together in a comprehensive guide to spiritual and practical life.[^33] The work demonstrated that the high ethical standards of a virtuous religious life could be achieved through a synthesis of outward legal observance and inward spiritual purification.[^34]

### Critique of Philosophy: *Tahafut al-Falasifa*

Al-Ghazali's *Tahafut al-Falasifa* (The Incoherence of the Philosophers) represents a landmark in the history of philosophy.[^35] Written to defend Islamic orthodoxy against the rationalist philosophy of figures like al-Farabi and Avicenna, the work contains twenty discussions examining fundamental metaphysical and scientific questions.[^36] In seventeen of these discussions, al-Ghazali charged the philosophers with heresy (bid'a), while in three he declared them guilty of outright unbelief (kufr).[^37]

The three points of kufr concerned the eternity of the world (the philosophers' claim that the world has no temporal beginning), divine knowledge (their assertion that God knows only universals, not particulars), and bodily resurrection (their denial of physical resurrection in the afterlife).[^38] Al-Ghazali argued brilliantly against the philosophers' use of Aristotelian logic in metaphysics, contending that while logic was useful in mathematics and natural sciences, it could not establish necessary truths about metaphysical realities.[^39]

His critique advanced a nominalist position and a sophisticated analysis of causation that anticipated later developments in European philosophy.[^40] He famously argued for theological occasionalism, using the example of cotton burning when touching fire—asserting this occurs not because fire necessarily causes burning, but because God wills it to happen at that moment.[^41] This work was so influential that Ibn Rushd (Averroes) felt compelled to write *Tahafut al-Tahafut* (The Incoherence of the Incoherence) to defend philosophy against al-Ghazali's arguments.[^42]

### Educational Reform and Methodology

Al-Ghazali made significant contributions to educational theory and practice, laying out principles that guided Islamic education from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries.[^43] He emphasized the importance of moral and spiritual development alongside intellectual training, arguing that knowledge without ethical transformation was worthless.[^44] His educational philosophy stressed the need for students to internalize knowledge through practice and self-discipline rather than merely accumulating information.[^45]

### Legal and Theological Scholarship

In Islamic jurisprudence, al-Ghazali wrote *al-Mustasfa min 'ilm al-usul* (The Essentials of Islamic Legal Theory), which became a foundational text in the principles of Islamic jurisprudence.[^46] His work in Ash'arite theology helped refine and develop this school's positions, though he also introduced innovative elements, particularly from Avicennan psychology, which eventually became incorporated into mainstream Ash'arite thought.[^47]

### Autobiographical and Apologetic Works

*Al-Munqidh min al-Dalal* (Deliverance from Error) is al-Ghazali's spiritual autobiography, describing his intellectual journey through different schools of thought and his spiritual crisis.[^48] Written in a style reminiscent of Augustine's *Confessions*, it provides invaluable insight into the intellectual life of medieval Islam and remains a compelling defense of Sufi mysticism as the path to certain knowledge of God.[^49]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his towering reputation, al-Ghazali's work has been subject to significant controversy and criticism, both in his own time and among modern scholars.

### The Decline of Science Debate

One of the most persistent controversies surrounding al-Ghazali is the claim that his attack on philosophy contributed to the decline of scientific thought in the Islamic world.[^50] Professor Nuh Aydin and others have argued that the *Tahafut al-Falasifa*, particularly its doctrine of theological occasionalism, "nullified critical thinking in the Islamic world" by suggesting that philosophers cannot give rational explanations to metaphysical or physical questions.[^51] This view holds that al-Ghazali's subordination of reason to revelation stifled the flourishing scientific culture that had characterized earlier Islamic civilization.[^52]

However, this interpretation is vigorously contested by other scholars who argue that al-Ghazali explicitly stated he had no quarrel with physics, mathematics, astronomy, or logic—only with metaphysics.[^53] Recent scholarship demonstrates that "philosophy in the Muslim world thrived after Ghazali," as evidenced by the abundance of philosophical works in the twelfth century and beyond.[^54] Some scholars even credit al-Ghazali as "arguably the earliest scholar to advocate separation of social sciences from natural science."[^55] The debate over his role in the alleged scientific decline remains unresolved, with strong arguments on both sides.[^56]

### Philosophical Inconsistencies

Critics have accused al-Ghazali of inconsistency and even hypocrisy in his treatment of philosophy.[^57] While publicly attacking the philosophers in the *Tahafut*, he simultaneously incorporated significant elements of Avicennan philosophy into his own theological works, particularly Avicenna's psychology and theory of prophecy.[^58] The fifteenth-century Ottoman scholar Khwajahzada criticized al-Ghazali so harshly that Sheikh ul-Islam Ibn Kemal questioned whether Khwajahzada's purpose was to demonstrate the incoherence of al-Ghazali or of the philosophers.[^59]

Some scholars argue that there is an "erroneous assumption that he opposed Aristotelianism and rejected its teachings," when in fact "al-Ghazâlî understood the importance of falsafa and developed a complex response that rejected and condemned some of its teachings, while it also allowed him to accept and apply others."[^60] Nevertheless, the apparent contradictions between his public condemnations and his private appropriations of philosophical concepts have troubled commentators for centuries.[^61]

### Political Accommodation

Al-Ghazali's relationship with political power has also drawn criticism.[^62] Despite his later rejection of worldly ambition, he had served the Seljuq sultans and benefited from their patronage during his Baghdad years.[^63] His eventual realization that "the high ethical standards of a virtuous religious life are not compatible with being in the service of sultans, viziers, and caliphs" and that "benefiting from the riches of the military and political elite implies complicity in their corrupt and oppressive rule" came only after years of enjoying such benefits.[^64]

### Religious Exclusivism

Al-Ghazali's declaration of takfir (declaring someone an unbeliever) against philosophers like Avicenna has been controversial.[^65] Critics argue that his willingness to excommunicate fellow Muslims for holding philosophical positions on metaphysical questions contributed to intellectual intolerance within Islamic civilization.[^66] The three charges of kufr—concerning the eternity of the world, divine knowledge of particulars, and bodily resurrection—have been particularly disputed, with some scholars suggesting that al-Ghazali may have misunderstood the philosophers' actual positions, especially regarding God's knowledge.[^67]

### Impact on Women

Modern scholars have also criticized al-Ghazali's writings on gender relations and women's roles, particularly in his *Book on the Etiquette of Marriage*.[^68] His views reflected the patriarchal norms of medieval society, and some contemporary critics argue that his influence helped entrench traditional gender hierarchies in Islamic thought.[^69]

---

## Personal Life

Compared to his voluminous intellectual output, relatively little is known about al-Ghazali's personal and family life, as was typical for medieval scholarly biographies that focused on intellectual rather than domestic details.[^70]

Al-Ghazali grew up as an orphan together with his younger brother Ahmad Ghazali, who would also become a distinguished scholar and Sufi master.[^71] The two brothers remained close throughout their lives, with Ahmad temporarily taking over Muhammad's teaching position when the latter left Baghdad in 1095.[^72] When al-Ghazali departed on his spiritual journey, he made arrangements to ensure his brother could support al-Ghazali's family financially through the teaching position.[^73]

Al-Ghazali was married and had children, though the historical sources provide few details.[^74] Modern novels about al-Ghazali have imaginatively named his wife "Kholoub" or "Thuraiya" and given him daughters named Aisha and Fatima, but these are fictional embellishments rather than historical facts.[^75] What is certain is that before leaving Baghdad in 1095, he made careful financial arrangements for his family's support, establishing a trust fund to provide them with steady income during his absence.[^76]

His personality emerges most vividly in his autobiographical work, *Al-Munqidh min al-Dalal*.[^77] He describes himself as intellectually restless, driven by an insatiable desire for certain knowledge.[^78] His famous statement, "Never have I dealt with anything more difficult than my own soul, which sometimes helps me and sometimes opposes me," reveals his intense introspection and psychological self-awareness.[^79] This introspective capacity, unusual for his era, made him capable of radical honesty about his own motivations and spiritual states.[^80]

The spiritual crisis he experienced in 1095 provides the deepest insight into his character.[^81] Despite being at the height of worldly success, he was paralyzed by doubts about whether his actions were motivated by genuine piety or by ambition and love of prestige.[^82] The crisis became so severe that it manifested physically—he experienced impediment to his speech, difficulty eating, and deteriorating health.[^83] Physicians diagnosed it as a psychological ailment with no medical cure.[^84]

After his return from wandering and his period of seclusion, al-Ghazali lived a relatively simple life in Tus, spending his final years in a monastery-like community (khanqah) surrounded by Sufi disciples.[^85] He devoted himself to worship, teaching small groups of students, and writing.[^86] Though persuaded to return briefly to teaching at Nishapur in 1106, he remained there only until 1110, when he returned permanently to Tus.[^87] He died there on December 18, 1111, reportedly performing his ablutions for the dawn prayer.[^88]

## Legacy

Al-Ghazali's legacy is vast and multifaceted, extending across Islamic civilization and into European intellectual history. His influence has been described as "deep and everlasting," continuing to shape Islamic thought more than nine centuries after his death.[^89]

### Within Islamic Civilization

Within the Islamic world, al-Ghazali is regarded as one of the greatest scholars in history, honored with the title Hujjat al-Islam (Proof of Islam) and recognized as the mujaddid (renewer of the faith) for the eleventh century.[^90] Islamic scholars across the globe continue to reference his works for guidance on spiritual, philosophical, and legal matters.[^91] His integration of Sufism into mainstream Sunni Islam had particularly lasting effects, making mystical practice respectable and providing a framework that balanced outward legal observance with inward spiritual development.[^92]

The *Ihya' 'ulum ad-din* remains one of the most influential books in Islamic literature, second only to the Qur'an and hadith collections in terms of its impact on Muslim religious life.[^93] Its comprehensive treatment of worship, ethics, and spirituality has made it a constant companion for Muslims seeking to deepen their faith.[^94] Generations of Islamic scholars have written commentaries, abridgments, and elaborations of this work, ensuring its continued vitality.[^95]

### Impact on Islamic Philosophy and Theology

Although Islamic philosophy in the Avicennan style did not disappear after al-Ghazali—indeed, it continued to flourish in certain contexts—his critique fundamentally changed the terms of philosophical discourse in the Islamic world.[^96] The words "falasifa" (philosophers) and "falsafa" (philosophy) acquired negative connotations in many circles, and philosophical inquiry increasingly had to defend itself against Ghazalian skepticism.[^97] However, al-Ghazali also contributed greatly to the "philosophization of Islamic theology and Sufism," as theologians incorporated many of his conceptual tools and arguments.[^98]

His influence on Ash'arite theology was particularly profound.[^99] Al-Ghazali and his teacher al-Juwayni "imported some philosophical terms and topics into Ash'arite kalam and legitimized the use of formal Aristotelian logic in both Islamic theological and legal theories."[^100] His introduction of Avicennan ideas into Ash'arite theology, particularly regarding human psychology and the rational explanation of prophecy, eventually led to their adoption by the tradition.[^101]

### Influence on Western Thought

Al-Ghazali's influence extended far beyond the Islamic world into Christian and Jewish intellectual traditions.[^102] His works were translated into Latin and studied by medieval European scholastics.[^103] Western scholars influenced by al-Ghazali include Dante, Thomas Aquinas, and David Hume.[^104] Thomas Aquinas specifically studied al-Ghazali's works at the University of Naples and was notably influenced by his ideas, particularly in psychology and moral philosophy, adopting and adapting some of his concepts within Christian philosophy.[^105]

Several of al-Ghazali's arguments in the *Tahafut* seem to have been adopted by Aquinas "to similarly reestablish the authority of orthodox Christian religion in the West."[^106] The intellectual movement in thirteenth-century Europe engaged not only with Avicenna and Averroes but also extensively with al-Ghazali's works.[^107] His nominalist critique of Aristotelian metaphysics anticipated developments in fourteenth-century European philosophy, making him a significant precursor to later Western philosophical movements.[^108]

### Educational Legacy

Al-Ghazali's contributions to educational theory and practice shaped Islamic education for centuries.[^109] His emphasis on the integration of moral and spiritual development with intellectual training established a pedagogical model that balanced the transmission of knowledge with the formation of character.[^110] His writings on the ethics of teaching and learning remained influential in Islamic educational institutions well into the modern period.[^111]

### Continuing Relevance

In the contemporary Islamic world, al-Ghazali remains extraordinarily relevant.[^112] His synthesis of law, theology, and mysticism offers a model for Muslims seeking to navigate modernity while maintaining traditional values.[^113] His personal struggle with doubt and his ultimate affirmation of faith through mystical experience resonate with Muslims facing the challenges of secularization and religious pluralism.[^114] His works are regularly reprinted, translated, and studied, and his intellectual legacy continues to inspire new generations of Islamic scholars and spiritual seekers.[^115]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view al-Ghazali positively emphasize his role as a synthesizer who brought together disparate strands of Islamic thought into a coherent whole.[^116] The twentieth-century scholar W. Montgomery Watt called him "the greatest Muslim after Muhammad," arguing that al-Ghazali's integration of theology, philosophy, and mysticism saved Islam from either rigid legalism or antinomian mysticism.[^117] 

Positive assessments highlight his intellectual honesty and courage in abandoning worldly success to pursue spiritual truth.[^118] His willingness to subject his own motivations to rigorous self-examination and to admit doubts publicly is seen as exemplifying the highest standards of intellectual integrity.[^119] Scholars in this camp argue that his critique of philosophy was not anti-rational but rather represented a sophisticated understanding of the limits of human reason in matters of ultimate truth.[^120]

Contemporary Islamic scholars particularly value al-Ghazali's demonstration that Sufism, with its emphasis on personal experience and spiritual purification, could coexist harmoniously with rational philosophy and legal scholarship.[^121] This integration made the mystical dimensions of Islam accessible to both scholars and laypeople, enriching Islamic spirituality while maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy.[^122] His work showed that deep religious devotion and intellectual sophistication were not merely compatible but mutually reinforcing.[^123]

Defenders of al-Ghazali's philosophical legacy argue that attributing the decline of science in the Islamic world to him is both historically inaccurate and philosophically naive.[^124] They point out that he explicitly affirmed the value of mathematics, logic, astronomy, and physics, and that his occasionalist arguments in metaphysics had little direct impact on scientific practice.[^125] Modern scholars note that "philosophy in the Muslim world thrived after Ghazali," as evidenced by the continued production of philosophical works and scientific achievements in subsequent centuries.[^126]

His educational philosophy is praised for its holistic approach, emphasizing that knowledge must lead to ethical transformation and that intellectual development must be accompanied by moral and spiritual growth.[^127] This vision of education as character formation rather than mere information transmission is seen as particularly relevant to contemporary educational debates.[^128]

### Negative Views

Critics of al-Ghazali, both medieval and modern, focus on several key points of contention. The most significant criticism is that his attack on philosophy contributed to intellectual stagnation in the Islamic world.[^129] This view, articulated by various scholars, holds that his occasionalist theology undermined the philosophical foundations of natural science by denying necessary causal connections in nature.[^130] If fire doesn't necessarily burn cotton but does so only when God wills, critics argue, then there can be no stable natural laws to investigate scientifically.[^131]

Ibn Rushd's *Tahafut al-Tahafut* mounted a vigorous defense of philosophy against al-Ghazali, arguing that his arguments were based on misunderstandings of philosophical positions and that his conclusions were themselves philosophically incoherent.[^132] Ibn Rushd particularly criticized al-Ghazali's stance on causality and his declaration of takfir against philosophers, arguing that philosophical inquiry into natural and metaphysical questions was not only permissible but necessary for a full understanding of God's creation.[^133]

Modern rationalist scholars criticize al-Ghazali for privileging mystical experience over rational inquiry as a path to truth.[^134] They argue that his emphasis on direct spiritual experience (dhawq) as superior to discursive reasoning contributed to anti-intellectualism in Islamic culture.[^135] This criticism suggests that by making mystical intuition rather than rational demonstration the ultimate arbiter of truth, al-Ghazali undermined the foundations of systematic thought.[^136]

Some historians argue that al-Ghazali's relationship with political power was more opportunistic than his later spiritual awakening suggests.[^137] They note that he benefited extensively from sultanic patronage during his Baghdad years and only developed his critique of serving political authorities after his crisis—a conversion of convenience, as it were.[^138] His later vow never to serve political authorities or teach at state-sponsored schools is seen by cynical observers as belated piety rather than consistent principle.[^139]

Philosophical critics point to apparent contradictions between al-Ghazali's public denunciations of philosophy and his extensive use of philosophical concepts and methods in his own theological works.[^140] This has led some to question either his intellectual consistency or his honesty, suggesting that he publicly condemned what he privately employed.[^141] The fifteenth-century criticism by Khwajahzada was so severe that it questioned whether al-Ghazali's own arguments were more incoherent than those of the philosophers he attacked.[^142]

Contemporary feminist scholars criticize al-Ghazali's views on gender and his contribution to patriarchal interpretations of Islamic law and social relations.[^143] His writings on marriage and women's roles, they argue, helped entrench traditional gender hierarchies that continue to limit women's opportunities in Muslim societies.[^144]
