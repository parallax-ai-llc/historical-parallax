## Overview

Churchill called it **"the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history."**
Singapore was the "Gibraltar of the East," a fortress island considered impregnable.
On February 15, 1942, Lieutenant-General **Arthur Percival** surrendered 80,000 British, Indian, and Australian troops to a Japanese force of only 35,000 led by General **Tomoyuki Yamashita** ("The Tiger of Malaya").
The fall of Singapore signaled the beginning of the end of the British Empire.

## The "Impregnable" Fortress

**The Myth:** "The guns point the wrong way."
It is often said the big coastal guns could only point out to sea. This is false; they could turn around, but they had mostly Armor Piercing (AP) ammo for ships, not High Explosive (HE) for infantry.
**The Jungle Mistake:**
The British commanded believed tanks could not pass through the Malayan jungle.
The Japanese proved them wrong, using **bicycles** and light tanks to move with lightning speed down the Malay Peninsula, outflanking British positions repeatedly.

## The Surrender

The Japanese were actually running out of ammo and supplies. Yamashita later admitted he was bluffing.
Percival, fearing the slaughter of civilians (water supplies had been cut), walked out under a white flag to the Ford Motor Factory.
Yamashita demanded: *"All I want to hear from you is Yes or No!"*
Percival surrendered.

## The Horror: Sook Ching & Changi

**Sook Ching Massacre:**
The Japanese Kempeitai executed between 5,000 and 25,000 Chinese civilians in Singapore whom they deemed "hostile." Men were taken to beaches and machine-gunned.
**POWs:**
The Allied prisoners were marched to Changi Prison. Thousands were later sent to the Thai-Burma "Death Railway" (Bridge on the River Kwai), where they died of starvation, cholera, and beatings.
