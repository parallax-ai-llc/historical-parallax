## Overview

The Fall of Singapore was the worst disaster in British military history. Singapore, the "Gibraltar of the East," was considered an impregnable fortress. However, its massive guns pointed out to sea. General Yamashita's Japanese army attacked from the land (Malayan jungle), riding bicycles and moving faster than British expected. 80,000 British, Indian, and Australian troops surrendered to a Japanese force of 30,000. It signaled the end of the British Empire in Asia.
