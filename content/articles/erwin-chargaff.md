## Summary

Erwin Chargaff discovered that DNA has equal amounts of adenine and thymine, and equal amounts of guanine and cytosine (Chargaff's rules), providing crucial clues for Watson and Crick's discovery of the double helix structure. His observation of base pairing complementarity was essential to understanding DNA replication and genetic coding.
