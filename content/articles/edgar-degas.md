## Summary

Edgar Degas (1834-1917) was a French painter, sculptor, and printmaker who became one of the founders of Impressionism, though he preferred to be called a realist.[^1] Especially celebrated for his depictions of ballet dancers, which comprise more than half of his artistic output, Degas revolutionized modern art through his innovative compositional techniques influenced by photography and Japanese prints.[^2] A superb draftsman who mastered the depiction of movement, Degas created approximately 1,500 works depicting dancers and pioneered the use of unconventional perspectives and cropping.[^3] Despite his artistic brilliance, his legacy is complicated by his virulent antisemitism during the Dreyfus Affair and his often difficult personality.[^4] Nearly blind in his final years, he died in 1917 and was hailed as a French national treasure, with his influence extending to 20th-century masters including Picasso and Matisse.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Edgar Degas was born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas on July 19, 1834, in Paris, France, the eldest of five children in a moderately wealthy banking family.[^6] His father, Auguste De Gas, was a banker, while his mother, Célestine Musson De Gas, was an American Creole from New Orleans, Louisiana.[^7] The family's prosperity and cultural sophistication provided young Edgar with significant advantages—music featured prominently in the Degas home, where his mother sang opera arias and his father arranged occasional recitals.[^8] This exposure to the arts would profoundly shape his aesthetic sensibilities.

Tragedy struck when Degas was only thirteen years old: his mother Célestine died after bearing five children, leaving a lasting impact on the young artist's emotional development.[^9] Despite this loss, his family ensured he received an excellent education, sending him in 1845 to the prestigious Lycée Louis-le-Grand, a leading boys' school where he received a conventional classical education.[^10] He graduated in 1853 with a baccalaureate in literature at age eighteen, already having converted a room in his family home into an artist's studio.[^11]

His maternal heritage connected him deeply to New Orleans through his grandfather Germain Musson, who was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, of French descent and had settled in New Orleans in 1810 as a cotton exporter following the Haitian Revolution.[^12] This American connection would later draw Degas to Louisiana for an extended stay. However, this family history also included a troubling legacy: members of the Musson and Degas families owned slaves, supported the Confederacy, and had ties to white supremacist groups during Reconstruction, with Edgar Degas's mother having her dowry increased by her father's sale of a young slave girl.[^13]

To appease his father's wishes, Degas registered for law school in November 1853, but his heart lay elsewhere.[^14] At eighteen, he was accepted as a copyist at the Louvre, where he spent countless hours studying and copying works of the old masters—a traditional but essential form of artistic training.[^15] In 1855, a pivotal moment occurred when he met the renowned neoclassical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, whom he deeply revered.[^16] Ingres gave him advice he never forgot: "Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist."[^17] This emphasis on drawing and line work would become fundamental to Degas's artistic approach throughout his career.

## Rise to Prominence

In April 1855, Degas was admitted to the prestigious École des Beaux-Arts, where he received formal academic training.[^18] However, he would stay for only a year before embarking on what would become a transformative journey. In July 1856, at age twenty-two, Degas traveled to Italy, where he remained for the next three years—a period crucial to his artistic development.[^19] There he drew and painted copies after the great Renaissance masters: Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and others, absorbing their techniques and compositional strategies.[^20]

Returning to France, Degas initially pursued the most respected form of painting in academic circles: historical subjects. He created conventional history paintings such as "The Daughter of Jephthah" (c. 1859-61) and "Young Spartans Exercising" (c. 1860-62), attempting to establish himself through traditional channels.[^21] In 1865, his "Medieval War Scene" was accepted by the Paris Salon, the official art exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and the most important annual art event in the Western world.[^22] Two years later, in 1868, his "Mademoiselle Fiocre in the Ballet 'La Source'" was exhibited at the Salon, marking his growing interest in theatrical subjects.[^23]

A crucial turning point came in 1861 when Degas met fellow painter Édouard Manet while copying at the Louvre.[^24] The pair quickly developed a friendly rivalry, and Degas grew to share Manet's disdain for the presiding art establishment and its rigid conventions.[^25] This relationship helped propel Degas toward the avant-garde artistic circles that would eventually form the Impressionist movement.

The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 interrupted Degas's artistic career when he enlisted in the National Guard in July 1870.[^26] During rifle training, a discovery was made that would haunt him for the rest of his life: his eyesight was found to be defective, with significant problems in his right eye.[^27] This visual impairment would progressively worsen over the decades, eventually reducing him to near-total blindness. For the rest of his life, his eye problems were a constant worry and significantly influenced his artistic choices, particularly his later turn to sculpture and pastels.[^28]

After the war, in 1872, Degas began an extended stay in New Orleans, where his brother René and numerous other relatives lived.[^29] During this five-month visit from October 1872 to March 1873, he painted two significant compositions set in the office of his maternal uncle Michel Musson, a cotton buyer.[^30] One of these works, "A Cotton Office in New Orleans" (also known as "Portraits in an Office"), garnered favorable attention back in France and became historically significant as the first painting by Degas—and indeed the first by an Impressionist—to be purchased by a museum, the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Pau.[^31]

Between 1870 and 1874, Degas painted a pioneering group of ballet rehearsal and performance scenes, finding eager buyers and soon becoming identified with this signature theme.[^32] In April 1874, he participated in the First Impressionist Exhibition in Paris, exhibiting ten paintings, mostly modern portraits of laundresses and ballet dancers in radical poses.[^33] Although Degas is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist, and unlike many Impressionists, he did not paint outdoors.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Edgar Degas's artistic achievements span multiple media and subjects, with innovations that fundamentally changed modern art. His mastery of depicting movement, particularly in his renditions of dancers and bathing female nudes, established him as a superb draftsman whose technical brilliance remains unquestioned.[^35]

**Ballet Dancers: The Signature Achievement**

Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance, with more than half of his works depicting dancers.[^36] His interest in ballet dancers intensified in the 1870s, and he eventually produced approximately 1,500 works on this subject.[^37] His 1873-76 painting "The Ballet Class" exemplifies his revolutionary approach, featuring innovative characteristics such as tilted perspective suggesting the influence of Japanese art and compositions that have the impression of being "zoomed in," borrowing from the photographic gaze at a time when photography was still in its infancy.[^38] These ballet paintings captured asymmetrical dynamic poses that feel like snapshots, anticipating the visual logic of street photography decades before it became common.[^39]

**Horse Racing Paintings**

Although famous for dancers, Degas also created numerous racing scenes throughout his career, with production stepping up in the 1880s.[^40] The demolition and remodeling of Paris in the 1850s and 1860s had imported the British pastime of horse racing onto the Parisian social scene, with the newly opened hippodrome at Longchamp becoming fashionable.[^41] Degas's equestrian studies often show horses' fidgety impatience and coiled energy as they line up before a race, revealing his attraction to the theme for the opportunities it offered to study shapes and movement.[^42] Recent advances in photography had captured the range of improbable shapes that galloping horses adopted, and Degas incorporated these realistic postures into his equestrian series.[^43]

**Sculptural Innovation**

In 1881, Degas exhibited what would be the only sculpture shown publicly during his lifetime at the 6th Impressionist Exhibition: "The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer" (La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans).[^44] The original sculpture was made from pigmented beeswax, clay, metal armature, rope, paintbrushes, human hair, silk and linen ribbon, cotton faille bodice, cotton and silk tutu, and linen slippers, on a wooden base—an unusual choice of medium for the time.[^45] The reaction was mixed to negative, with many critics shocked and calling it ugly and repulsive, though Joris-Karl Huysmans called it "the first truly modern attempt at sculpture I know."[^46] After Degas's death, his heirs discovered approximately 150 wax sculptures in his studio and commissioned bronze casts, with at least 28 bronze versions of "Little Dancer" now appearing in museums worldwide.[^47] The original wax sculpture is now housed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.[^48]

**Compositional and Technical Innovations**

Degas experimented with unconventional angles and asymmetrical compositions, elements common in candid photography but not in traditional painting.[^49] His approach to composition was greatly influenced by photography, often using a "snapshot" style that mimicked the off-center, cropped compositions seen in candid photographs.[^50] Cropping allowed him to select only part of a subject in the picture plane, creating a more intimate connection with the viewer.[^51] Interestingly, cameras were not actually capable of taking true snapshots when Degas created his brilliant compositions—he was anticipating a visual language that wouldn't become common until decades later.[^52]

Japanese prints also fascinated Degas and were a major influence, as artists like Hokusai and Hiroshige explored compositional techniques like idiosyncratic cropping, inconsistent perspectives, and asymmetry.[^53] Degas experimented with a wide variety of media, including oil, pastel, gouache, etching, lithography, monotype, wax modeling, and photography.[^54]

**Later Career Success**

By the late 1880s, Degas was recognized as a major figure in the Parisian art world.[^55] Later in his career, he began using far bolder colors, perhaps as a result of his deteriorating eyesight, creating striking results.[^56] Degas reached international success in his own lifetime when his painting "Danseuses à la barre" sold for half a million francs at Durand-Ruel in 1912—an astronomical sum.[^57]

**Bringing Classical Methods to Modern Life**

By bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, Degas became a classical painter of modern life.[^58] Like the Impressionists, he sought to capture fleeting moments in the flow of modern life, yet he showed little interest in painting plein-air landscapes, favoring scenes in theaters and cafés illuminated by artificial light.[^59] Once marginalized as merely a "painter of dancers," Degas is now counted among the most complex and innovative figures of his generation, credited with influencing Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and many leading figurative artists of the 20th century.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Edgar Degas's artistic legacy is significantly complicated by multiple controversies, ranging from his virulent antisemitism to critical debates about the nature of his depictions of women.

**Antisemitism and the Dreyfus Affair**

The Dreyfus Affair brought Degas's hitherto veiled antisemitism to the surface and intensified his hatred of Jews from the 1890s to the early 1900s.[^61] However, Degas had expressed his antisemitism in conversations with colleagues well before the Dreyfus Affair became public.[^62] He had his housekeeper read aloud from "Libre Parole"—a nationalist and antisemitic newspaper—while he ate breakfast, "nodding slightly here and there to signal his agreement," demonstrating that his bigotry was systematically cultivated rather than consisting of occasional outbursts.[^63]

By the mid-1890s, Degas had broken off relations with all of his Jewish friends, publicly disavowed his previous friendships with Jewish artists, and refused to use models who he believed might be Jewish.[^64] The Impressionist painter Camille Pissarro, himself Jewish, called Degas a "savage anti-Semite" in a letter to his son Lucien.[^65] Julie Manet's diary details the extremes of his bigotry, which at times would reduce him to tears of anger; she describes finding him in a "state against the Jews," forcing her to withdraw without speaking to him.[^66]

In one particularly disturbing incident, Degas once threw a model out of his studio, screaming at her that she was Jewish—though she was actually Protestant.[^67] After the Dreyfus scandal, Degas ended relationships with Jewish friends who had been almost like family to him, including Ludovic Halévy, with whom he had been extremely close, as well as Pissarro, the only Jew among the Impressionists.[^68] Prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Degas's circle of intimate friends had included many Jews, including the Halévy family, Charles Ephrussi, and Charles Haas, making his later rejection of these relationships even more striking.[^69]

**Depictions of Women: The Bathing Nudes Controversy**

When Degas showed his "suite of nudes" at the eighth and final Impressionist exhibition in 1886, critics viciously attacked the ungainly poses of his bathers.[^70] The series, entitled "Suite of female nudes, bathing, washing, drying themselves, wiping themselves, combing their hair or having their hair combed," inspired harsh criticism and fueled controversy about the artist's alleged misogyny.[^71]

Some critics believed that works like "After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself" were tactless in their depiction of the female nude, lacking any kind of idealization and deviating from standard academic convention.[^72] Critics particularly objected to the fact that most of these works appeared to represent prostitutes and their attendants.[^73] Degas himself, speaking about these works, said he intended to create a feeling in the viewer "as if you looked through a keyhole"—a statement that has fueled accusations of voyeurism.[^74]

More recently, Degas has been accused of misogyny, with many viewing these paintings as a debasement of women who suffer under the voyeuristic, unwelcome male gaze.[^75] The sensual submissiveness of these figures has led to feminist readings that view them as depicted purely for the pleasure of the male observer.[^76] Similarly, his depictions of young ballet dancers have come under scrutiny, with some modern critics pointing to "the scary truth behind Degas's ballet paintings," noting that many of the young dancers at the Paris Opera Ballet came from impoverished backgrounds and were often sexually exploited by wealthy patrons—a social reality that Degas would have been aware of.[^77]

However, some scholars have defended Degas's work. Critic Octave Mirbeau commended Degas for his bold break from conventional artistic style and praised him for rejecting the temptation to portray women in an unrealistically idealized light.[^78] Curator Richard Kendall believed that Degas's works were particularly special precisely because they were so non-erotic in nature, supporting Carol Armstrong's point that the nude bodies were meant to exist "in a world of their own" and were not meant to be sexualized by the viewer.[^79]

**Difficult Personality**

Throughout his life, Degas was known for his insightful yet cutting wit and somewhat morose nature.[^80] His argumentative nature was deplored by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, who said of him: "What a creature he was, that Degas! All his friends had to leave him; I was one of the last to go, but even I couldn't stay till the end."[^81] As the years passed, Degas became increasingly isolated, due in part to his belief that a painter could have no personal life.[^82] However, in later life, Degas expressed regret over the loss of his Jewish friends, suggesting some recognition of what his prejudices had cost him.[^83]

---

## Personal Life

Edgar Degas never married and was not known to have romantic affairs, spending his life dedicated almost entirely to his art.[^84] He believed firmly that a painter could have no personal life, a conviction that contributed to his increasing isolation as he aged.[^85] The outspoken, well-regarded Manet was a very different personality from the introspective and often self-doubting Degas, yet the two maintained a complex friendship and rivalry.[^86]

**Relationship with Mary Cassatt**

Degas did develop a close relationship with the American artist Mary Cassatt that lasted nearly forty years, though it was passionate but platonic, with no indication of anything romantic between them.[^87] In 1877, after Degas admired Cassatt's 1874 painting entry at the Paris Salon, artist Joseph-Gabriel Tourny introduced them, launching a fast and intense friendship.[^88] Cassatt said that exposure to the innovative work of Edgar Degas marked a "turning point in my artistic life."[^89]

Their collaboration was multifaceted: Degas often enlisted Cassatt to model for his paintings—she is the subject of at least eight of his works.[^90] Infrared images revealed that Degas had contributed brushstrokes to Cassatt's painting "Little Girl in a Blue Armchair," subtly changing the perspective.[^91] They collected each other's work and worked on a journal of original prints together, titled "Le Jour et la Nuit."[^92] Cassatt later recalled: "Degas sometimes became angry because he could not find any weaknesses in me, and sometimes we did not see each other for months at a time, until something I had painted brought us back together again."[^93] Curiously, she ended up burning almost every letter between them, so the full extent of their relationship remains unknown.[^94]

When Degas died in 1917, Cassatt revealed her feeling of great loss: "He was my oldest friend here, and the last great artist of the nineteenth century."[^95]

**Financial Crisis and Increased Productivity**

In 1874, Degas suddenly found himself facing financial troubles with the death of his father and the discovery of his brother René's significant business debts.[^96] To make ends meet, Degas sold his house and inherited art collection, and for the first time in his life became dependent on the sale of his artworks.[^97] Under mounting financial pressure, Degas embarked upon a decade of great productivity—a period that paradoxically produced some of his most celebrated works.[^98]

**Declining Eyesight**

By the late 1880s, Degas's eyesight had begun to fail seriously, perhaps as a result of an injury suffered during his service defending Paris during the Franco-Prussian War.[^99] He first mentioned his eye problems at age nineteen, but the disease only became a serious impediment in 1870, when he was thirty-six and noticed during rifle practice that he could not see the target with his right eye.[^100] Degas suffered from progressive bilateral central visual loss and photophobia, with the French artist experiencing progressive visual loss from a type of maculopathy during the last forty years of his life.[^101]

By the turn of the twentieth century, Degas was almost blind with a left central scotoma and residual visual acuity of approximately 6/60.[^102] He would write about "the torment of seeing only around the blind spot itself," and that therefore painting had become an "exercise of circumvention."[^103] While his early works were abundant with intricate detail, his later works became increasingly sketchy and coarse, with the spacing of his shading lines increasing proportionally to his deteriorating visual acuity over nearly three decades.[^104]

After his eyesight failed dramatically, Degas focused almost exclusively on dancers and nudes, increasingly turning to sculpture as his vision weakened.[^105] In the mid-1880s, he began modeling ballerina statuettes and horses in wax over metal frameworks, eventually producing approximately 150 wax sculptures.[^106] He descended eventually into total blindness several years before his death in 1917.[^107]

**Final Years**

In 1912, facing increasing difficulties with his eyesight, Degas moved to an artistically vibrant section of Paris on the Boulevard de Clichy, though his visual impairments significantly affected the quality and quantity of his output.[^108] He spent his last years, nearly blind, restlessly wandering the streets of Paris before dying on September 27, 1917.[^109] At his death, he was hailed as a French national treasure.[^110]

## Legacy

Edgar Degas's influence on modern art has been profound and enduring, with his innovations continuing to resonate more than a century after his death. His groundbreaking compositions, revolutionary use of lighting and shadow, and emphasis on everyday life have impacted enormously many artists, including Impressionists and Modernists.[^111] He was a key founder of the Impressionist movement, and his work influenced future renowned artists like Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.[^112]

**Influence on Photography and Cinema**

Degas provided the foundation for creating aesthetics in snapshots in photography and early cinema based on realism by concentrating on moments that pass by quickly and on straightforward expressions.[^113] His anticipation of photographic framing techniques—cropping, unusual angles, asymmetrical compositions—proved prophetic, as these would become fundamental to photography and film in the twentieth century.[^114]

**Contemporary Relevance**

Recent scholarship demonstrates the ongoing relevance of Edgar Degas to 20th- and 21st-century ideas and art practices.[^115] Contemporary practitioners have used Degas's creativity as a springboard to engage imaginatively and critically with themes of colonialism, gender, race, and class.[^116] The first comprehensive assessment of Degas's legacy to be published in over two decades, "Perspectives on Degas," unites a team of international scholars to analyze his work, artistic practice, and unique methods of pictorial problem-solving.[^117]

**Scholarly Reassessment**

Established scholars and curators have shown how recent trends in art historical thinking can stimulate innovative interpretations of Degas's paintings, prints, sculptures, and drawings, revealing new ideas about his place in the art historical narrative of the nineteenth-century avant-garde.[^118] Fresh readings of the gendered, racial, and class contexts of particular works reconsider the artist's relationship to his contemporaries.[^119]

**Modernist Character**

As a classical painter of modern life who brought traditional methods of history painting to bear on contemporary subject matter, Degas occupies a unique position in art history.[^120] His emphasis on drawing and line, inherited from his reverence for Ingres, combined with his radical compositional innovations and choice of modern subjects, created a distinctive aesthetic that defied easy categorization.[^121]

**Market Value and Museum Collections**

Degas's works command significant prices in the art market and are treasured by major museums worldwide. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Musée d'Orsay, National Gallery of Art in Washington, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Museum of Fine Arts Boston, and countless other institutions hold important examples of his paintings, pastels, and sculptures.[^122] His international success during his own lifetime, exemplified by "Danseuses à la barre" selling for half a million francs in 1912, established a precedent for the high valuation of his work that continues today.[^123]

**Complex Historical Reckoning**

Degas's legacy is increasingly understood as complex and multifaceted, requiring acknowledgment of both his extraordinary artistic achievements and his serious moral failings, particularly his antisemitism.[^124] Modern viewers and scholars must contend with the uncomfortable reality that great art can be created by deeply flawed individuals, and that understanding historical context does not require excusing reprehensible behavior or beliefs.[^125]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and critics have consistently praised Degas's technical mastery and innovative contributions to modern art. Once marginalized as merely a "painter of dancers," he is now counted among the most complex and innovative figures of his generation.[^126] His influence on Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and many of the leading figurative artists of the twentieth century is well-documented and celebrated.[^127]

Art historians emphasize Degas's role as a classical painter of modern life who successfully brought traditional academic training to bear on contemporary subject matter in ways that revolutionized painting.[^128] His mastery of drawing and line, combined with his willingness to experiment with composition, perspective, and medium, created a body of work that remains fresh and compelling.[^129]

The Metropolitan Museum of Art's assessment emphasizes that "by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life."[^130] The museum further notes that "like the Impressionists, he sought to capture fleeting moments in the flow of modern life."[^131]

Contemporary scholars working on "Perspectives on Degas" have demonstrated how his work remains relevant to current artistic and theoretical concerns.[^132] The willingness of contemporary practitioners to engage critically with his work, using it as a springboard for discussions of colonialism, gender, race, and class, testifies to its continuing power and relevance.[^133]

Richard Kendall and other curators have argued for the progressive nature of some of Degas's work, particularly his refusal to idealize the female form and his commitment to depicting reality rather than fantasy.[^134] Octave Mirbeau's contemporary praise for Degas's bold break from conventional artistic style represents an appreciation for his willingness to challenge academic norms.[^135]

### Negative Views

Critics and scholars have increasingly confronted the darker aspects of Degas's life and work, particularly his virulent antisemitism. Camille Pissarro's characterization of him as a "savage anti-Semite" represents contemporary recognition of the extremity of his prejudice.[^136] Modern scholars have documented how Degas's antisemitism was not casual but systematic, cultivated through regular reading of antisemitic newspapers and expressed through the deliberate severing of longstanding friendships.[^137]

Feminist art historians have raised serious questions about Degas's depictions of women, particularly the bathing nudes and young ballet dancers. The accusation that these works represent a debasement of women under the voyeuristic male gaze has gained scholarly support.[^138] His own statement that he wanted viewers to feel "as if you looked through a keyhole" when viewing the bathing scenes has been used as evidence of problematic intentions.[^139]

The social context of the Paris Opera Ballet—where young dancers from impoverished backgrounds were often sexually exploited by wealthy patrons—raises questions about Degas's relationship to this exploitation.[^140] Some critics argue that his repeated depictions of these young women cannot be separated from his awareness of their vulnerable social position.[^141]

His difficult personality and increasing isolation represent another area of criticism. Pierre-Auguste Renoir's lament that "all his friends had to leave him" speaks to the personal cost of Degas's combative nature and rigid convictions.[^142] The fact that even Renoir, known for his genial disposition, could not maintain the friendship suggests the severity of Degas's interpersonal difficulties.[^143]

The contemporary critical reception of "The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer" as "ugly and repulsive" reflects not only aesthetic disagreement but also discomfort with Degas's unflinching realism and his choice to depict a working-class subject without idealization.[^144] While modern scholars often celebrate this realism, it's important to acknowledge that it violated contemporary expectations and created genuine discomfort among viewers.[^145]
