## Summary

Walther Nernst was a German chemist who won the 1920 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in thermochemistry, specifically the third law of thermodynamics (Nernst heat theorem). He also developed the Nernst equation for electrochemistry and invented the Nernst lamp. His third law states that entropy approaches zero as temperature approaches absolute zero.
