## Summary

John Tukey coined the terms 'bit' (binary digit) and 'software,' invented the box plot and stem-and-leaf display, and co-invented the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm with James Cooley. His 1977 book Exploratory Data Analysis created a new approach to statistics. The FFT is one of the most important algorithms in computing and signal processing.
