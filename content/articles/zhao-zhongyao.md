## Summary

Zhao Zhongyao was a Chinese nuclear physicist who was the first to observe the anomalous absorption of hard gamma rays by lead in 1930 at Caltech, which was later recognized as evidence of positron-electron pair production. Though he did not receive credit at the time, his observation predated Anderson's positron discovery. He helped found Chinese nuclear physics.
