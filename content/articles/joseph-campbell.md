## Summary

Joseph Campbell was an American mythologist, author, and professor who transformed the modern understanding of mythology and its relationship to religion and spirituality. His book The Hero with a Thousand Faces introduced the concept of the monomyth (the hero's journey), which influenced artists from George Lucas to countless novelists. His PBS interview series The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers introduced millions to comparative mythology and his famous advice: 'Follow your bliss.'
