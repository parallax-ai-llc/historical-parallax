## Summary

James Hutton was a Scottish geologist who is considered the father of modern geology. He proposed uniformitarianism and the concept of deep time, recognizing that the Earth must be immeasurably old based on geological evidence. His observation at Siccar Point of an angular unconformity demonstrated vast periods of geological time. Hutton's ideas were later popularized by Charles Lyell.
