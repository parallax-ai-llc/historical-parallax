## Overview

Vasco da Gama (c. 1460 – 1524) was a formidable Portuguese nobleman and explorer who fundamentally altered the course of world history by discovering the sea route from Europe to India. His maiden voyage (1497–1499) was the longest ocean voyage ever undertaken at the time, connecting the West and the Orient by bypassing the Ottoman-controlled Silk Road. While celebrated in Europe as a hero who broke the Arab/Venetian spice monopoly, in Asia and Africa, he is often remembered as a brutal invader who introduced gunboat diplomacy to the peaceful Indian Ocean trade network. Da Gama's legacy is one of immense courage, brilliant navigation, and shocking cruelty.

## Historical Context: The Quest for Spices

**The Problem:**
In the 15th century, spices (pepper, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) were worth their weight in gold. They were essential for preserving meat in a time before refrigeration and for medical use.
The trade was controlled by a "Middleman Cartel":
1.  Spices grew in India/Indonesia.
2.  Arab merchants shipped them to Egypt.
3.  Venetian merchants bought them in Alexandria and sold them to Europe at a 1000% markup.

**The Solution:**
Prince Henry the Navigator initiated Portugal's push down the African coast.
King Manuel I chose Vasco da Gama—not a merchant, but a knight of the Order of Santiago—for the final push. The mission was not just commercial, but a crusading one: to find "Christians and Spices" and surround Islam.

## The First Voyage (1497-1499)

### The Fleet (Armada)
*   **São Gabriel**: Flagship (178 tons). Commanded by Vasco.
*   **São Rafael**: Commanded by his brother, Paulo da Gama.
*   **Berrio**: A nimble caravel (Nicolau Coelho).
*   **Supply Ship**: Filled with food, to be burned later.
**Crew:** ~170 men (mostly convicts/criminals given a chance at pardon).
**Provisions:** Hardtack (biscuits), salted beef, wine, water (which turned foul quickly).

### The Navigational Genius (Volta do Mar)
Da Gama took a terrifying risk. Past Cape Verde, instead of fighting the headwinds along the African coast, he turned **west** into the open Atlantic, almost reaching Brazil.
He spent **93 days** out of sight of land (Columbus spent only 33). This huge arc utilized the South Atlantic trade winds to sling-shot him to the Cape of Good Hope. It remains a standard sailing route today.

### East Africa: Hostility
*   **Mozambique:** Da Gama pretended to be Muslim to meet the Sultan. When discovered as Christian, mobs rioted. Da Gama fired his cannons into the city as he fled.
*   **Mombasa:** The Sultan tried to trap the fleet. Da Gama tortured two fishermen with boiling oil to reveal the plot.
*   **Malindi:** The only friendly port. The Sultan of Malindi (rival of Mombasa) welcomed them and provided a pilot.
    *   **The Pilot:** Often identified as the legendary Ahmad ibn Majid (debated). He taught Da Gama how to use the Monsoon winds to cross the Indian Ocean in just 23 days.

## Arrival in Calicut (May 1498)

The fleet anchored in Calicut (Kerala), the spice capital of the world.
**"For Christ and Spices!"**
A local Tunisian merchant asked in broken Spanish: *"What the devil brought you here?"*
Da Gama's men replied: *"We come in search of Christians and spices."*

### The Encounter with the Zamorin
Da Gama was paraded through the streets to meet the **Zamorin** (Hindu King).
**The Diplomatic Disaster:**
Da Gama offered gifts from King Manuel I:
*   12 pieces of striped cloth
*   4 hoods
*   6 hats
*   4 strings of coral
*   A box of sugar
*   2 casks of oil/honey
The Zamorin's courtiers laughed openly. Arab merchants sneered, "This is a gift for a beggar, not a King. Where is your gold?"
When Da Gama claimed his King was the riches in the world, the Zamorin asked why he brought nothing.
Relating soured. Da Gama was effectively held hostage until he sold his goods. He eventually fled, kidnapping 6 locals to prove he had been to India.

## The Return of the Damned

He ignored local advice and sailed back against the Monsoon winds (Summer Monsoon).
*   Trip to India: 23 days.
*   Trip Back: **132 days**.
**Scurvy:** The crew's gums swelled over their teeth, preventing them from eating. They died in agony.
Only 55 of the 170 men survived. The *São Rafael* was burned because there weren't enough men to sail her.
Paulo da Gama died just miles from home. Vasco returned in September 1499, broken by grief but triumphant.
**ROI:** The cargo of pepper he brought back paid for the expedition **60 times over**.

## The Second Voyage (1502): The Reign of Terror

Da Gama returned not as an explorer, but as an admiral with 20 warships. His goal was to force the Zamorin to surrender.

### The Massacre of the Pilgrim Ship (*Miri*)
He intercepted a ship carrying ~400 Muslim pilgrims returning from Mecca.
The passengers offered all their wealth. Da Gama took it... then locked them all in the hold.
He set the ship on fire. It burned for days.
Mothers held up their babies through the portholes, begging for mercy. Da Gama watched from his deck unmoved. All perished. It remains one of the darkest chapters in exploration history.

### Bombardment of Calicut
He demanded the Zamorin expel all Muslims. When refused, he shelled the unfortified city for two days.
He captured 30 fishermen, hung them from the yards, cut off their hands, ears, and noses, and sent a boatload of the severed parts to the Zamorin with a note: *"Make a curry with these."*
