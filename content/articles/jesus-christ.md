## Summary

Jesus of Nazareth (c. 4 BC – AD 30/33), also known as Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity, believed by Christians to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah prophesied in the Hebrew Bible. A Jewish preacher and religious leader in 1st-century Roman Judea, Jesus began his ministry around age 30, teaching about the Kingdom of God, performing miracles, and gathering disciples. After approximately three years of public ministry, he was crucified by Roman authorities under Pontius Pilate around AD 30-33. Christians believe he rose from the dead three days later, fulfilling prophecies of his divinity. His life and teachings became the foundation of Christianity, now the world's largest religion with over 2.4 billion followers, fundamentally shaping Western civilization, ethics, art, literature, and philosophy for two millennia.

## Early Life and Background

### Birth and Infancy

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke provide accounts of Jesus's birth, placing it in Bethlehem during the reign of King Herod the Great (died 4 BC). Modern scholars estimate his birth between 6 and 4 BC, based on the reference to Herod's reign. According to Christian tradition, Jesus was born to Mary, a virgin, through divine conception by the Holy Spirit, fulfilling the prophecy from Isaiah about a virgin bearing Immanuel ("God with us").

The Gospel of Luke describes the angelic announcement to Mary, the journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem for a Roman census, and Jesus's birth in a manger because there was no room in the inn. Shepherds were reportedly visited by angels announcing the birth of the Savior. The Gospel of Matthew recounts the visit of Magi (wise men) from the East who followed a star to worship the newborn "King of the Jews," bringing gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

Matthew also describes King Herod's attempt to kill the infant Jesus, prompting the family's flight to Egypt, where they remained until Herod's death. This "Flight into Egypt" and the subsequent "Massacre of the Innocents" (Herod's order to kill all male infants in Bethlehem) are found only in Matthew's Gospel.

### Childhood in Nazareth

After Herod's death, Joseph, Mary, and Jesus returned to Nazareth in Galilee, where Jesus spent his childhood and early adult years. Very little is recorded about this period, leading scholars to call it the "hidden years" or "silent years." Luke provides the only Gospel account of Jesus's childhood, describing his presentation at the Temple in Jerusalem at age 12, where he astonished teachers with his understanding and questions.

Jesus grew up in Nazareth, a small village in Galilee with perhaps 400 inhabitants. Archaeological evidence suggests it was a modest agricultural community. Joseph is identified as a "tekton" (τέκτων), traditionally translated as "carpenter," though the term could indicate a craftsman or builder working with wood or stone. Jesus likely learned this trade from Joseph.

Jewish boys in this period would have received religious education focused on the Torah and Hebrew scriptures. Jesus demonstrated deep knowledge of Jewish law, prophets, and wisdom literature throughout his ministry, suggesting thorough religious education despite Galilee's reputation among Judean Jews as culturally backward.

## Ministry and Teachings

### Baptism and Temptation

Around age 30 (the customary age for Jewish men to begin teaching), Jesus came to the Jordan River to be baptized by John the Baptist, a prophetic figure calling for repentance. All four Gospels record this event, with the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke) describing the heavens opening, the Holy Spirit descending like a dove, and a voice from heaven declaring, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

Following his baptism, Jesus spent 40 days and nights fasting in the Judean wilderness, where he was tempted by Satan. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke detail three specific temptations: turning stones into bread, jumping from the Temple pinnacle to test God's protection, and worshiping Satan in exchange for all the kingdoms of the world. Jesus rejected each temptation by quoting Deuteronomy.

### Galilean Ministry

Jesus began his public ministry in Galilee, teaching in synagogues, proclaiming the "good news" (gospel) of the Kingdom of God, and calling people to repentance. He gathered twelve disciples (apostles) to accompany him, including fishermen Simon Peter, Andrew, James, and John, a tax collector named Matthew, and others from various backgrounds.

**Key Teachings:**

The **Sermon on the Mount** (Matthew 5-7) represents Jesus's most comprehensive ethical teaching, including:
- The Beatitudes ("Blessed are the poor in spirit...")
- The Lord's Prayer
- Commands to love enemies and not resist evil
- Warnings against hypocrisy, materialism, and judgment
- The Golden Rule: "Do unto others as you would have them do to you"

**Parables:** Jesus taught primarily through parables—short stories using familiar situations to convey spiritual truths:
- The Good Samaritan (love for neighbors, including enemies)
- The Prodigal Son (God's forgiveness and mercy)
- The Sower (reception of God's message)
- The Mustard Seed (growth of God's kingdom)
- The Lost Sheep (God's search for the lost)

### Miracles

The Gospels record numerous miracles attributed to Jesus, categorized as:

**Healing Miracles:**
- Curing leprosy, blindness, deafness, paralysis
- Healing the centurion's servant
- Restoring the man with the withered hand
- Healing on the Sabbath (controversial acts)

**Nature Miracles:**
- Calming a storm
- Walking on water
- Feeding 5,000 people with five loaves and two fish
- Feeding 4,000 with seven loaves
- Turning water into wine at Cana

**Exorcisms:**
- Casting out demons from possessed individuals
- Healing the Gerasene demoniac

**Raising the Dead:**
- Jairus's daughter
- The widow of Nain's son
- Lazarus of Bethany (after four days in the tomb)

These miracles served as signs of Jesus's divine authority and the in-breaking of God's Kingdom, though Jesus warned against seeking miracles merely for spectacle.

### Core Messages

**Kingdom of God:** Jesus's central message proclaimed the nearness of God's Kingdom—a realm where God's will is done, characterized by justice, mercy, peace, and divine presence. This Kingdom was both present in Jesus's ministry and yet to come in fullness.

**Love and Compassion:** Jesus emphasized love of God and love of neighbor as the greatest commandments. He extended this to include love of enemies, radical forgiveness ("seventy times seven"), and compassion for society's outcasts—tax collectors, prostitutes, Samaritans, lepers, and the poor.

**Criticism of Religious Hypocrisy:** Jesus frequently condemned the religious leaders (Pharisees, Scribes, Sadducees) for legalism, hypocrisy, and burdening people with religious rules while neglecting justice, mercy, and faithfulness. He accused them of straining out gnats while swallowing camels.

**Radical Ethics:** Jesus's teachings challenged conventional morality:
- Non-resistance to evil ("turn the other cheek")
- Giving to all who ask
- Storing treasure in heaven, not on earth
- Impossibility of serving both God and money
- Narrow gate to salvation

## Final Week and Crucifixion

### Triumphal Entry

Jesus's final week began with his entry into Jerusalem on a donkey, fulfilling Zechariah's prophecy about a humble king. Crowds welcomed him with palm branches and shouts of "Hosanna," hailing him as the Messiah. This "Palm Sunday" event occurred during Passover, when Jerusalem swelled with Jewish pilgrims.

### Temple Cleansing

Jesus entered the Temple and overturned the tables of money changers and sellers of sacrificial animals, declaring, "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves." This confrontation with Temple authorities intensified the conflict that would lead to his arrest.

### Last Supper

On Thursday evening, Jesus gathered with his twelve disciples to celebrate Passover. During this "Last Supper," he:
- Washed his disciples' feet, modeling servant leadership
- Instituted the Eucharist/Communion, blessing bread and wine as his body and blood
- Predicted his betrayal by Judas Iscariot
- Gave his "farewell discourse" (John 13-17), commanding his disciples to love one another
- Predicted Peter's denial

### Gethsemane and Arrest

After the meal, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives to pray. In anguish, anticipating his coming suffering, he prayed three times for the cup of suffering to pass from him, yet submitted to God's will: "Not my will, but yours be done."

Judas arrived with Temple guards and identified Jesus with a kiss. Jesus was arrested while his disciples fled. Peter briefly resisted, cutting off the ear of the high priest's servant, but Jesus rebuked violence and healed the man's ear.

### Trials

Jesus faced multiple trials during the night and early morning:

**Jewish Trials:**
- Before Annas (former high priest)
- Before Caiaphas and the Sanhedrin (Jewish council)
- Accused of blasphemy for claiming to be the Messiah and Son of God

**Roman Trials:**
- Before Pontius Pilate (Roman governor)
- Before Herod Antipas (ruler of Galilee)
- Back to Pilate

Pilate found no fault in Jesus but yielded to crowd pressure, whipped by Jewish leaders. Pilate offered to release Jesus as part of Passover custom, but the crowd chose Barabbas, a rebel and murderer. Pilate symbolically washed his hands of responsibility but ordered Jesus's crucifixion.

### Crucifixion

On Friday morning (later called Good Friday), Jesus was:
- Mocked by Roman soldiers who placed a crown of thorns on his head
- Forced to carry his cross toward Golgotha ("place of the skull")
- Crucified between two criminals
- Given a sign above his head reading "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" (INRI)

While on the cross, Jesus spoke "Seven Last Words":
1. "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do"
2. "Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise" (to repentant thief)
3. "Woman, behold your son... Behold your mother" (entrusting Mary to John)
4. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (quoting Psalm 22)
5. "I thirst"
6. "It is finished"
7. "Father, into your hands I commit my spirit"

At the moment of Jesus's death, the Gospels report:
- Darkness covered the land for three hours
- The Temple veil tore from top to bottom
- An earthquake
- Tombs opened and saints rose
- A Roman centurion declared, "Truly this was the Son of God"

Joseph of Arimathea, a wealthy follower, requested Jesus's body and buried it in his own new tomb, sealed by a large stone. Guards were posted at the tomb at the request of Jewish leaders who remembered Jesus's prediction of rising after three days.

## Resurrection and Ascension

### Empty Tomb

On Sunday morning, women followers (including Mary Magdalene) came to the tomb to anoint Jesus's body with spices. They found the stone rolled away and the tomb empty. Angels (or a young man in white, depending on the Gospel) announced, "He is not here; he has risen!"

### Post-Resurrection Appearances

Over the next 40 days, Jesus appeared to his disciples and others:
- To Mary Magdalene in the garden
- To two disciples on the road to Emmaus
- To the disciples in locked rooms
- To Thomas, who doubted until he saw and touched Jesus's wounds
- To seven disciples by the Sea of Galilee
- To over 500 people at once (1 Corinthians 15:6)

These appearances demonstrated the physical reality of the resurrection (Jesus ate fish, could be touched) while also showing his transformed, glorified state (appearing in locked rooms, disappearing, not always immediately recognized).

### Great Commission

Before his ascension, Jesus commissioned his disciples to:
- Make disciples of all nations
- Baptize in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
- Teach all he had commanded
- Receive power from the Holy Spirit
- Be his witnesses to the ends of the earth

### Ascension

Forty days after the resurrection, Jesus ascended into heaven from the Mount of Olives, with angels promising his return in the same way. The disciples returned to Jerusalem to await the promised Holy Spirit, which came at Pentecost ten days later, launching the Christian church.

## Historical Jesus vs. Christ of Faith

### Historical Evidence

While no contemporary non-Christian sources describe Jesus's life in detail, several first- and second-century sources confirm his existence:

**Roman Sources:**
- Tacitus (Annals, c. 116 AD) mentions Christ's execution under Pontius Pilate
- Pliny the Younger (c. 112 AD) describes Christians worshiping Christ as God
- Suetonius (c. 120 AD) mentions "Chrestus" causing disturbances

**Jewish Sources:**
- Josephus (Antiquities, c. 93-94 AD) contains the "Testimonium Flavianum" about Jesus (partially authentic, partially interpolated)
- Talmudic references (hostile but acknowledging his existence)

**Christian Sources:**
- Four canonical Gospels (Mark c. 70 AD, Matthew and Luke c. 80-90 AD, John c. 90-100 AD)
- Paul's letters (50s AD, earliest Christian documents)
- Other New Testament writings

### Scholarly Consensus

Modern historians generally agree on certain facts about Jesus:
- He existed as a historical person
- He was a Jewish teacher in early 1st-century Judea/Galilee
- He was baptized by John the Baptist
- He gathered followers and taught in parables
- He was crucified by Roman authorities under Pontius Pilate
- His followers claimed resurrection experiences

Beyond these basics, scholarly opinions diverge on:
- The extent and nature of his miracles
- His self-understanding (Did he claim to be Messiah/God?)
- The historical accuracy of specific Gospel details
- The theological interpretation of his life and death
