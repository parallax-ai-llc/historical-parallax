## Summary

Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was an English philosopher widely regarded as one of the founders of modern political philosophy. Born prematurely during the Spanish Armada crisis, he lived an exceptional 91 years, spending much of his life in service to the Cavendish family.[^1] His masterwork, *Leviathan* (1651), established the foundations of social contract theory and political absolutism, arguing that without strong government, human life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."[^2] Though controversial in his time—accused of atheism and materialism—Hobbes profoundly influenced Enlightenment thinkers including John Locke, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and the founders of the United States.[^3] His secular, rational approach to political philosophy marked a decisive break from medieval scholasticism and established many terms of debate that persist in contemporary political theory.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Thomas Hobbes was born on April 5, 1588, in Westport, now part of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England.[^5] His birth was premature, triggered when his mother heard news of the approaching Spanish Armada. Hobbes later reflected on this inauspicious beginning, remarking that "my mother gave birth to twins: myself and fear."[^6] This comment proved prophetic, as fear—particularly the fear of violent death and civil disorder—would become central to his political philosophy.

His father, also named Thomas Hobbes, was the vicar of both Charlton and Westport parishes.[^7] However, the elder Hobbes was a quick-tempered man who disgraced himself after engaging in a brawl with another clergyman outside his own church door.[^8] Following this scandal, Hobbes's father fled to London, abandoning his wife and three children—Thomas, his older brother Edmund, and his sister Anne.[^9] The children were left in the care of their uncle, Francis Hobbes, a wealthy and childless glove manufacturer who became Thomas's patron and supporter.[^10]

Hobbes's early education began at age four in Westport church, after which he attended the Malmesbury school.[^11] He subsequently studied under Robert Latimer, a young Oxford graduate who ran a private school and recognized Hobbes's exceptional intellectual gifts.[^12] Under Latimer's tutelage, Hobbes developed strong skills in classical languages and demonstrated remarkable academic promise.

At the age of fifteen, in 1603, Hobbes entered Magdalen Hall (the predecessor to Hertford College) at the University of Oxford.[^13] Between 1601 and 1608, he studied scholastic logic and mathematics, though he appears to have followed his own curriculum, as he found the prevailing scholastic learning unattractive.[^14] During his university years, Hobbes developed an interest in maps and geography.[^15] In 1608, he completed his B.A. degree by incorporation at St. John's College, Cambridge, marking the beginning of a new chapter in his intellectual journey.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

Upon graduating from Oxford in February 1608, Hobbes's life took a decisive turn when he was recommended by Sir James Hussey to serve as tutor to William Cavendish, son of William Cavendish, Baron of Hardwick (who would later become the first Earl of Devonshire).[^17] This position initiated a lifelong connection with the Cavendish family that would span seven decades and provide Hobbes with the financial security, intellectual resources, and social connections essential for his philosophical development.[^18]

Hobbes served as companion to the younger William Cavendish for twenty years, first as his tutor and later as his secretary.[^19] This relationship gave Hobbes access to extensive libraries, exposure to aristocratic society, and opportunities for continental travel that were invaluable for his intellectual formation.[^20] The Cavendish connection would prove to be one of the most significant relationships of his life, continuing until his death at Hardwick Hall in 1679.[^21]

In 1629, Hobbes published a brilliant translation of Thucydides' *History of the Peloponnesian War*, demonstrating his classical scholarship and revealing his early interest in the nature of political conflict and human behavior during times of crisis.[^22] This translation was significant not merely as a scholarly achievement but as evidence of Hobbes's developing political consciousness—Thucydides's realistic portrayal of power politics and human nature would profoundly influence Hobbes's own political thought.[^23]

A pivotal moment in Hobbes's intellectual development occurred around 1629 or 1630, when he encountered a volume of Euclid's *Elements*.[^24] According to reports, Hobbes "fell in love with geometry" and with Euclid's method of demonstrating theorems through logical deduction from first principles.[^25] This discovery of geometric method would fundamentally shape his approach to philosophy, inspiring him to attempt to construct a systematic science of politics and human nature based on rigorous, deductive reasoning.[^26]

Through his connection with the Cavendish family, Hobbes gained access to intellectual circles on the Continent. He made contact with the renowned French polymath Marin Mersenne and his circle of scholars in Paris, which included leading scientific and philosophical figures of the age.[^27] During his travels, Hobbes visited Galileo Galilei in Florence in 1636 while the great scientist was under house arrest following his condemnation by the Inquisition.[^28] Hobbes later described Galileo as "the greatest philosopher of all times," and the Italian scientist's mechanistic approach to natural philosophy deeply influenced Hobbes's own thinking.[^29]

Hobbes also met and corresponded with René Descartes, though their relationship was marked by mutual antipathy and philosophical disagreement.[^30] In 1641, Hobbes wrote a critique of Descartes's *Meditations on First Philosophy*, which was printed as the third set of "Objections" appended to Descartes's work, along with Descartes's "Replies."[^31] This engagement with Descartes positioned Hobbes at the center of seventeenth-century philosophical debates about knowledge, certainty, and the foundations of science.[^32]

By 1640, Hobbes had completed *The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic*, his first systematic treatise on political philosophy.[^33] However, as tensions escalated between King Charles I and Parliament, culminating in the outbreak of the English Civil War, Hobbes feared for his safety. When Parliament arrested the Earl of Strafford and Archbishop Laud, charging Strafford with high treason, Hobbes fled to France in 1640, describing himself as "the first of all that fled."[^34] This exile would last eleven years and prove to be his most productive period as a political philosopher.[^35]

## Major Achievements

During his eleven-year exile in Paris (1640-1651), Hobbes produced his most important and enduring works of political philosophy.[^36] In Paris, he rejoined Mersenne's intellectual circle and associated with exiled English Royalists, immersing himself in the philosophical and political debates of the era.[^37]

In 1642, Hobbes published *De Cive* (*Concerning the Citizen*), the first installment of his ambitious philosophical trilogy.[^38] This work presented a systematic account of political authority grounded in his mechanistic understanding of human nature and his conception of the social contract. *De Cive* argued that legitimate political authority derives from a covenant among individuals seeking to escape the violent insecurity of the state of nature.[^39]

In 1647, Hobbes accepted a position as mathematical instructor to the young Charles, Prince of Wales (the future King Charles II), who had come to Paris from Jersey.[^40] This relationship with the future monarch would later prove valuable when Hobbes returned to England and faced accusations of atheism and heresy.[^41]

Hobbes's greatest achievement came in 1651 with the publication of *Leviathan, or The Matter, Forme and Power of a Common-Wealth Ecclesiasticall and Civil*.[^42] This masterwork is regarded as one of the earliest and most influential examples of social contract theory and remains a foundational text in political philosophy.[^43] Written during the tumultuous years of the English Civil War, *Leviathan* presented a comprehensive theory of human nature, the origins of political authority, and the structure of legitimate government.[^44]

The work's central argument proceeds from a mechanistic understanding of human beings and their passions. Hobbes postulates that in the absence of government—a condition he calls the "state of nature"—each person would have unlimited liberty to pursue their own interests.[^45] However, this unlimited liberty would inevitably lead to a "war of all against all" (*bellum omnium contra omnes*), as individuals competed for scarce resources, sought security against threats, and pursued reputation and glory.[^46] In Hobbes's memorable description, life in the state of nature would lack "industry," "culture of the earth," "navigation," "commodious building," "knowledge," "arts," "letters," or "society," characterized instead by "continual fear and danger of violent death," making the life of man "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."[^47]

To escape this intolerable condition, rational individuals would agree to a social contract, surrendering their natural liberty to a sovereign authority—whether a monarch, an assembly, or another form of government—in exchange for security and peace.[^48] The sovereign would possess absolute authority to maintain order, determine property rights, regulate the economy, define crimes and punishments, command the military, interpret law, and even serve as the supreme interpreter of scripture and authority over any national church.[^49] This argument for absolute sovereignty was Hobbes's solution to the problem of political instability and civil war that had devastated England.[^50]

In 1655, Hobbes published *De Corpore* (*Concerning Body*), the first part of his philosophical trilogy, which presented his views on logic, scientific method, geometry, and physics.[^51] Hobbes supervised an English translation published in 1656, and a revised edition appeared in 1668.[^52] *De Corpore* was intended to provide the metaphysical and methodological foundations for his political philosophy, demonstrating how all phenomena, including political life, could be understood through materialist and mechanistic principles.[^53]

In 1658, Hobbes completed his trilogy with *De Homine* (*Concerning Man*), which focused on physiology and optics.[^54] Together with *De Cive* and *De Corpore*, these works represented Hobbes's attempt to construct a comprehensive philosophical system ranging from the most fundamental principles of matter and motion to the specific science of politics.[^55]

Hobbes also made significant, if controversial, contributions to natural philosophy. He published a treatise on optics (*Tractatus opticus*) in Mersenne's 1644 collection *Cogitata physico-mathematica*.[^56] His optical magnum opus, *A Minute or First Draught of the Optiques* (1646), presented a sophisticated theory proposing that dilations and contractions of light sources stimulate the eye through contact with a medium.[^57] He used geometric principles to explain refraction and regarded color as light perturbed by rough or coarse bodies on its way to the eye.[^58]

In his final years, Hobbes remained intellectually active. At the age of 87, he completed English verse translations of Homer's *Iliad* and *Odyssey*, a remarkable achievement demonstrating his continued classical scholarship and literary abilities despite his advanced age.[^59]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Throughout his life and for centuries after his death, Hobbes faced intense criticism and controversy, particularly regarding his religious views and his political philosophy.[^60]

The most damaging accusations against Hobbes concerned atheism and materialism. Multiple contemporaries, including Bishop John Bramhall, accused him of teachings that could lead to atheism—a charge Hobbes described as "words of the greatest defamation possible."[^61] In seventeenth-century England, atheism was not merely a philosophical position but a serious crime that could result in prosecution and punishment.[^62]

In 1666, the House of Commons introduced a bill against atheism and profaneness, and Hobbes's *Leviathan* was scrutinized as potentially falling under its provisions.[^63] Only King Charles II's personal protection saved Hobbes from serious legal consequences, though the king prohibited him from publishing any more works in England.[^64] The royal intervention reflected both Hobbes's former service as the king's mathematics tutor and the delicate political balance of Restoration England.[^65]

The charges of atheism stemmed from Hobbes's radical materialism. He argued repeatedly that there are no incorporeal substances, and that all things—including human thoughts, and even God, heaven, and hell—are corporeal, matter in motion.[^66] This materialist metaphysics was difficult to reconcile with traditional Christian theology, which held that God, angels, and the human soul are immaterial spiritual entities.[^67] The Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth devoted considerable energy to refuting Hobbesian atheism and materialism, viewing it as a grave threat to religion and morality.[^68]

Modern scholars continue to debate whether Hobbes was genuinely an atheist or a highly unorthodox Christian.[^69] Some interpreters argue that Hobbes's professions of belief in God were merely protective cover for his underlying atheism.[^70] Others, however, contend that careful reading of *Leviathan* reveals that Hobbes was far from an atheist and was certainly a Christian, albeit one who dismissed all Christian dogma except the minimal statement of faith that Jesus was the Christ.[^71] According to this interpretation, Hobbes believed that only this bare confession—"Jesus is the Christ"—was necessary for salvation, and that all other theological doctrines could be determined by the sovereign.[^72]

Hobbes's views on scripture further inflamed religious controversy. He denied the infallibility of scripture and argued that the biblical texts did not represent the immediate word of God nor were necessarily written by the authors to whom they were ascribed.[^73] He also developed an unusual theory of religious language, arguing that our religious utterances do not describe hidden realities or affirm literal truths, but are meant only to honor—not describe—the incomprehensible cause behind nature.[^74] This deflationary account of religious language seemed to undermine the cognitive content of theology entirely.[^75]

Hobbes's political philosophy also generated intense criticism. His argument that the sovereign should possess absolute authority over both civil and religious matters was seen as tyrannical by many contemporaries and later thinkers.[^76] While Hobbes argued that absolute sovereignty was necessary to prevent civil war, critics countered that such unchecked power could itself become a source of oppression and injustice.[^77]

Hobbes's mathematical work became a source of particular embarrassment and controversy. In *De Corpore* (1655), he claimed to have solved the ancient problem of squaring the circle—constructing a square equal in area to a given circle using only compass and straightedge.[^78] The mathematician John Wallis immediately published a scathing rebuttal, demonstrating that Hobbes's geometrical proofs contained fundamental errors.[^79] What began as a mathematical dispute escalated into a bitter personal and philosophical conflict that lasted from the mid-1650s until 1678.[^80]

Wallis, a prominent Presbyterian divine as well as an eminent mathematician, saw the mathematical errors as evidence of the bankruptcy of Hobbes's entire materialist philosophical system.[^81] He also viewed Hobbes's philosophy as "a dangerous mix of atheism and pernicious political theory."[^82] Hobbes persistently defended his mathematical work even as he proposed multiple contradictory circle quadratures, including one in 1669 that would assign to π the value of exactly 3.2.[^83] The controversy demolished Hobbes's reputation as a mathematician and became a source of ridicule among the scientific community.[^84]

Despite these controversies, or perhaps partly because of them, Hobbes remained a central figure in seventeenth-century intellectual life. His willingness to challenge established orthodoxies in religion, politics, and natural philosophy made him both influential and notorious, establishing him as one of the most provocative thinkers of his age.[^85]

## Personal Life

Unlike many prominent intellectuals of his era, Thomas Hobbes never married and had no children.[^86] His personal life was remarkably devoted to scholarship, the service of the Cavendish family, and intellectual pursuits rather than domestic relationships.[^87]

Hobbes had an older brother named Edmund, who remained in Malmesbury as an adult, became a glover, married, had three children, and served as Alderman or mayor of the borough.[^88] He also had a sister named Anne.[^89] After their father's disgrace and flight, the three siblings were raised by their wealthy uncle Francis Hobbes, who provided for their education and upbringing.[^90]

Despite his unmarried state, Hobbes apparently retained romantic sensibilities even in extreme old age. His biographer John Aubrey noted that Hobbes wrote love verses late in life, including the remarkable lines: "Though I am past ninety, and too old / T'expect preferment in the court of Cupid."[^91] This suggests that Hobbes, though devoted to philosophical and scholarly pursuits, was not entirely indifferent to romantic feeling.[^92]

Hobbes's closest and most enduring relationship was with the Cavendish family, which began in 1608 when he was hired as tutor to William Cavendish and continued until his death seventy-one years later.[^93] This extraordinary association provided not only financial support but also intellectual companionship, access to libraries, opportunities for travel, and social connections that were essential to his work.[^94] The relationship demonstrated remarkable loyalty on both sides—the Cavendishes continued to support Hobbes even when his controversial views might have made such association politically awkward, while Hobbes remained devoted to the family throughout his long life.[^95]

In his final years, Hobbes's health declined. He developed a "shaking palsy" that worsened progressively throughout his life; by the end, he was unable to write his own name.[^96] Modern medical historians believe he likely suffered from Parkinson's disease.[^97] Despite this physical deterioration, Hobbes remained intellectually active, completing his verse translations of Homer in his late eighties.[^98]

Hobbes spent his final four or five years at Chatsworth House and Hardwick Hall, estates of his patron William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Devonshire.[^99] In October 1679, Hobbes suffered from a bladder disorder, followed by a paralytic stroke.[^100] He died on December 4, 1679, at Hardwick Hall, having reached the exceptional age of ninety-one.[^101] His last words were reported to be "A great leap in the dark."[^102] His body was interred in St. John the Baptist's Church in Ault Hucknall, Derbyshire.[^103]

Hobbes's personal character, as described by contemporaries, combined intellectual arrogance with personal warmth, fierce independence with long-term loyalty, and rationalist skepticism with genuine fear of disorder and death. His life exemplified the scholarly ideal of his age while his ideas challenged nearly every intellectual orthodoxy of his time.[^104]

## Legacy

Thomas Hobbes's influence on Western political thought can scarcely be overstated. He is widely recognized as the founding father of modern political philosophy, having set the terms of debate about the fundamentals of political life that continue into our own times.[^105] His secular, rational approach to political questions marked a decisive break from medieval political theology and established a new methodology for thinking about government, authority, and social organization.[^106]

Hobbes's most enduring legacy lies in his development of social contract theory. While others before him had used contractual metaphors to explain political obligation, Hobbes was the first to give the social contract its full systematic exposition and defense.[^107] His framework—beginning from an analysis of human nature, proceeding through a hypothetical state of nature, and arriving at the necessity of a social contract to establish legitimate authority—became the template for subsequent political philosophy.[^108]

John Locke, writing shortly after Hobbes's death, adopted many elements of Hobbes's thought while developing the first comprehensive account of political liberalism.[^109] Although Locke took pains to distance himself from Hobbes's absolutism, Hobbes's influence is evident in Locke's account of the state of nature, his argument that legitimate government originates in the consent of the governed, and his view that political community should serve basic, common needs.[^110] Through Locke, Hobbes indirectly influenced the founders of the United States, who proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence and Constitution a new kind of politics based on equality and consent.[^111]

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, despite significant philosophical differences with Hobbes, was profoundly influenced by Hobbes's methodology and his insight into the conventional rather than natural origins of political authority.[^112] Rousseau's own social contract theory, though reaching very different conclusions about the proper form of government, proceeded from premises established by Hobbes.[^113] Immanuel Kant likewise engaged deeply with Hobbesian themes in developing his own moral and political philosophy.[^114]

Beyond these canonical figures, Hobbes shaped the development of modern political thought in multiple ways. His fundamentally secular methodology demonstrated that political philosophy could be based on observation and reason rather than revelation or metaphysics.[^115] This approach established Hobbes as a founding figure of modern political inquiry and social science generally.[^116] His insistence that political authority requires rational justification rather than traditional or divine sanction remains a foundational assumption of modern political discourse.[^117]

Hobbes's influence extends to contemporary political theory and philosophy. Rational choice theory, game theory, and economic approaches to political analysis all trace intellectual lineage to Hobbes's model of individuals as self-interested, rational calculators.[^118] Contemporary debates about the justification of state authority, the nature of political obligation, and the relationship between individual liberty and collective security continue to engage with Hobbesian themes.[^119]

In international relations theory, Hobbes has been enormously influential, though often in ways that oversimplify or distort his actual views. The "Hobbesian" model of international politics—depicting relations among states as a lawless state of nature characterized by constant competition and the threat of war—has become a staple of realist approaches to international relations.[^120] However, as scholars like Noel Malcolm have demonstrated, this standard interpretation often functions as "an 'ideal type' and at worst as a caricature" rather than an accurate representation of Hobbes's subtle views on interstate relations and international law.[^121]

Hobbes's legacy is not without critics. Many philosophers have challenged his pessimistic view of human nature, his argument for absolute sovereignty, and his reduction of politics to an instrument serving self-interest.[^122] Thinkers in the Aristotelian tradition argue that politics serves not merely basic needs but higher ends, including moral development and human flourishing.[^123] Nevertheless, even Hobbes's critics must engage with the problems he identified and the terms of debate he established.[^124]

The contemporary world remains, in many respects, the world that Hobbes addressed: a world where traditional authorities face constant challenge, where social and political inequality appears questionable, where religious authority encounters persistent dispute, and where all human beings are supposed to possess fundamental rights protecting their basic interests.[^125] We continue to grapple with the Hobbesian questions: How can political authority be justified? What obligations do individuals owe to their governments? How can social order be maintained in pluralistic societies where people disagree about fundamental values? Hobbes's answers may not satisfy us, but his questions remain unavoidable.[^126]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Hobbes has been celebrated by numerous scholars as a groundbreaking and revolutionary thinker whose contributions fundamentally reshaped political philosophy. He is recognized as one of four towering pre-Enlightenment figures—along with Sir Francis Bacon, René Descartes, and John Locke—who set the stage for both the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment.[^127]

Scholars praise Hobbes for his intellectual courage in challenging established orthodoxies and applying rigorous, systematic reasoning to political questions.[^128] His insistence on basing political philosophy on observable facts about human nature rather than traditional authority or divine revelation represented a methodological revolution that enabled the development of modern social science.[^129] As one commentary notes, Hobbes "can be seen as a founding father of modern political inquiry and social science in general" precisely because of this secular, empirical approach.[^130]

Defenders of Hobbes emphasize the historical context in which he wrote. The English Civil War demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of political instability and religious conflict, making Hobbes's concern with order and security entirely reasonable.[^131] From this perspective, Hobbes's argument for strong sovereign authority was not tyrannical excess but a rational response to the real dangers of political fragmentation and civil war.[^132] His pessimism about human nature, often criticized as excessive, may have been vindicated by the violent conflicts of his age.[^133]

Modern scholars also appreciate the sophistication and complexity of Hobbes's arguments. Careful readers note that Hobbes's view of human motivation was more nuanced than simple egoism, incorporating elements of pride, fear, and the desire for social recognition.[^134] His political theory, while arguing for absolute sovereignty, also contained implicit limitations and qualifications that more superficial readings overlook.[^135]

Hobbes's contribution to establishing the framework of modern political thought—including concepts of individual rights, consent-based legitimacy, and the state's role in protecting basic interests—receives widespread scholarly recognition.[^136] His influence on subsequent thinkers from Locke to Rousseau to contemporary theorists demonstrates the fertility and power of his ideas.[^137] As one scholar notes, we still live in an intellectual world fundamentally shaped by Hobbes's insights and the problems he identified.[^138]

Contemporary political philosophers engaged with rational choice theory, game theory, and economic approaches to politics acknowledge Hobbes as an important precursor.[^139] His model of politics as emerging from the strategic interactions of rational individuals anticipated much subsequent social scientific theorizing.[^140]

### Negative Views

Despite his undeniable influence, Hobbes has faced sustained criticism from his own time to the present. The accusations of atheism and materialism that plagued him during his lifetime reflected genuine philosophical concerns about the implications of his thought for religion and morality.[^141]

Many critics argue that Hobbes's pessimistic view of human nature is empirically incorrect and morally corrosive. Thinkers in the Aristotelian tradition maintain that humans are naturally social and political animals, not isolated egoists who cooperate only from fear.[^142] From this perspective, Hobbes's state of nature is a philosophical fiction that misrepresents actual human psychology and the natural foundations of social life.[^143]

Hobbes's argument for absolute sovereignty has been widely criticized as authoritarian and dangerous. Critics point out that concentrating unlimited power in a sovereign creates opportunities for tyranny and oppression that may be worse than the instability Hobbes sought to prevent.[^144] Liberal political theorists argue that individual rights and constitutional limits on government authority are essential protections that Hobbes's system dangerously neglects.[^145]

Religious critics continue to challenge Hobbes's materialism and his subordination of religious authority to political power. His argument that the sovereign should control the interpretation of scripture and the doctrines of any national church strikes many as an intolerable violation of religious freedom and conscience.[^146] His reduction of religious language to mere honorific expression rather than genuine truth claims appears to evacuate religion of cognitive content and reduce it to social control.[^147]

Scholars have noted grave limitations in Hobbes's solutions to political problems, even if the problems themselves remain relevant.[^148] His faith in the capacity of absolute sovereignty to maintain order may have been excessive, underestimating both the difficulties of governing diverse populations and the dangers posed by unchecked power.[^149] Historical experience suggests that stable political order requires not merely concentrated power but also legitimacy, institutional checks, and social norms that Hobbes's theory inadequately addresses.[^150]

The demolition of Hobbes's mathematical work by John Wallis and others damaged his reputation as a natural philosopher and raised questions about his philosophical method more generally.[^151] While Hobbes's political philosophy survived this embarrassment, the mathematical controversy revealed the limits of his attempt to extend geometric method to all domains of inquiry.[^152]

Feminist scholars have criticized Hobbes's treatment of gender and family, noting that his supposedly universal account of human nature and political authority depends on unstated assumptions about patriarchal power and the subordination of women.[^153] His social contract, presented as an agreement among free and equal individuals, appears less universal when questions of gender and family structure are examined carefully.[^154]

Contemporary scholars in international relations have noted that the "Hobbesian" model of international politics—while influential—often represents a crude oversimplification that does injustice to Hobbes's actual views.[^155] The tendency to invoke "Hobbes" as shorthand for pessimistic realism about power politics has created a caricature that obscures the complexity of his thought.[^156]

Despite these criticisms, even Hobbes's detractors typically acknowledge his historical importance and the enduring power of the questions he raised, even when rejecting his answers. The intensity of critical engagement with Hobbes across four centuries testifies to the continuing relevance of his work.[^157]
