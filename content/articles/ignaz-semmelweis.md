## Summary

Ignaz Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician known as the 'savior of mothers' for discovering that handwashing with chlorinated lime solutions dramatically reduced the incidence of childbed fever in obstetric clinics. His evidence-based findings were rejected by the medical establishment of his time, and he was committed to a mental asylum where he died. His work was vindicated after his death when germ theory was established.
