## Summary

The Chilean coup of September 11, 1973 (Golpe de Estado en Chile de 1973), was a military overthrow of the democratically elected socialist government of President Salvador Allende, carried out by the Chilean Armed Forces under General Augusto Pinochet with significant backing from the United States government. The coup resulted in Allende's death during the military assault on the presidential palace, La Moneda, and installed a brutal military dictatorship that would rule Chile for the next 17 years.[^1]

The coup marked the violent end of Chile's "peaceful road to socialism" (vía chilena al socialismo)—Allende's attempt to transform Chile's society and economy through constitutional means. Under the slogan "make the economy scream," the Nixon administration had worked since 1970 to destabilize Allende's government through economic warfare, covert funding of opposition groups, and cultivation of coup-minded military officers.[^2]

The Pinochet regime that followed became one of the most notorious human rights violators of the 20th century. An estimated 3,200 people were killed or "disappeared," over 40,000 were tortured, and some 200,000 were forced into exile. Chile became a laboratory for neoliberal economic policies implemented by the "Chicago Boys," American-trained economists who radically restructured the economy while political dissent was crushed with extreme violence. Pinochet remained in power until 1990, when a referendum finally restored democratic rule.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Chilean Democracy and the Left

Unlike most of Latin America, Chile had a long tradition of stable democratic governance. Since the 1930s, leftist parties had participated openly in electoral politics, and the Communist Party was one of the largest in the hemisphere. This "exceptional" Chilean democracy would make Allende's election—and his overthrow—particularly shocking.[^4]

**Salvador Allende:**
- A physician and lifelong socialist, Allende ran for president four times
- First won major political office in the 1930s; served as Minister of Health, Senator, and Senate President
- Represented a coalition of socialists, communists, and other leftist parties[^5]

### The 1970 Election

On September 4, 1970, Salvador Allende won the presidential election with 36.3% of the vote in a three-way race. Under Chilean constitutional rules, Congress had to confirm the victory, which it did on October 24, 1970, making Allende the world's first democratically elected Marxist head of state.[^6]

The Nixon administration viewed this as a catastrophic Cold War defeat.

### US Efforts to Prevent Allende (1970)

Even before Allende took office, the United States attempted to prevent his confirmation:

**Track I:** Persuade the Chilean Congress to choose the second-place finisher (conservative Jorge Alessandri)

**Track II:** Promote a military coup before Allende could take office. The CIA:
- Established contact with coup-minded military officers
- Provided weapons for an attempted kidnapping of Army Commander René Schneider
- On October 22, 1970, Schneider was shot during the kidnapping attempt and died—but the attack backfired, generating sympathy for constitutional government and ensuring Allende's confirmation[^7]

### Allende's Government (1970-1973)

Once in office, Allende's Popular Unity (Unidad Popular / UP) government pursued ambitious reforms:

**Nationalizations:**
- Copper mines (Chile's main export, largely owned by US companies)
- Banks and key industries
- Land redistribution to peasants

**Social Programs:**
- Free milk for children
- Expanded education and healthcare
- Wage increases for workers[^8]

**Opposition and Economic Crisis:**
By 1972-1973, Chile faced severe economic difficulties:
- Nixon's "make the economy scream" policy: US cut off credit, discouraged foreign investment
- Internal opposition: strikes by truck owners, merchants, and professionals
- Inflation soared; shortages spread
- Political polarization intensified between left and right[^9]

### Military Planning

By mid-1973, with the economy in crisis and political tension at breaking point, elements of the Chilean military were actively planning a coup. The CIA was aware of the plotting, maintained intelligence contacts with conspirators, and did nothing to discourage the overthrow.[^10]

---

## The Coup: September 11, 1973

### Early Morning: The Plot Unfolds

In the predawn hours of September 11, 1973, the Chilean Navy seized control of Valparaíso, the country's main port. Across the country, military units began taking control of key installations.[^11]

At 6:30 AM, Allende was informed that a military coup was underway. He went to La Moneda palace to direct the government's resistance.

### Allende's Final Radio Address

At 9:10 AM, as military forces surrounded La Moneda and jets circled overhead, Allende made his final radio broadcast to the Chilean people:

> "Workers of my homeland! I have faith in Chile and its future. Other men will overcome this gray and bitter moment when treason tries to impose itself. You must know that, sooner rather than later, the great avenues through which free people walk to build a better society will open again. Long live Chile! Long live the people! Long live the workers! These are my last words. I am sure my sacrifice will not be in vain."[^12]

### The Attack on La Moneda

The military demanded Allende's surrender and offered him safe passage out of the country. He refused.

At 11:52 AM, Chilean Air Force Hawker Hunter jets began bombing La Moneda. Tanks fired on the palace. The building caught fire.[^13]

By 2:00 PM, soldiers stormed the burning palace. Salvador Allende was found dead inside. A 2011 autopsy confirmed he died by suicide with an AK-47 rifle given to him by Fidel Castro—he chose death over capture.[^14]

### The Junta Takes Power

That afternoon, a military junta assumed control of Chile:

- **General Augusto Pinochet** – Army Commander (became de facto leader)
- **Admiral José Toribio Merino** – Navy
- **General Gustavo Leigh** – Air Force
- **General César Mendoza** – Carabineros (police)

The junta dissolved Congress, outlawed leftist political parties, suspended the constitution, and declared a state of siege.[^15]

## The Pinochet Dictatorship (1973-1990)

### Immediate Repression

In the days and weeks following the coup, the military conducted a systematic campaign of terror:

**Mass Detention:**
- The National Stadium in Santiago was converted into a massive detention center, holding up to 40,000 political prisoners
- Thousands were processed, interrogated, tortured, and many were executed
- Similar detention centers operated throughout the country[^16]

**Targeted Killings:**
- The "Caravan of Death" (Caravana de la Muerte) – a military death squad that traveled by helicopter, executing political prisoners in provincial cities
- 75 confirmed victims of the Caravan alone[^17]

**DINA:** The Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (National Intelligence Directorate) was created in 1974 as the regime's secret police, responsible for torture, murder, and disappearances both in Chile and abroad.[^18]

### Operation Condor

Chile participated in Operation Condor, a coordinated campaign of political repression among South American military dictatorships (Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay) to track down and eliminate leftist opponents across borders. The operation involved:
- Assassination of exiled dissidents
- Intelligence sharing between dictatorships
- US support and coordination

The most notorious Condor operation was the 1976 car bombing in Washington, D.C., that killed former Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier and his American colleague Ronni Moffitt.[^19]

### Human Rights Toll

Over the 17 years of Pinochet's rule:

| Category | Estimated Number |
|----------|-----------------|
| Killed or Disappeared | 3,065-3,216 |
| Tortured | 27,000-38,000 |
| Politically Imprisoned | 28,000+ |
| Exiled | 200,000+ |
| Total Victims | 40,000+ |

**1,469 bodies remain unfound as of 2023**[^20]

### Economic Transformation: The "Chicago Boys"

Pinochet's regime implemented radical free-market economic reforms designed by economists trained at the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman (the "Chicago Boys"):

- Privatization of state enterprises, including social security
- Reduction of trade barriers
- Deregulation of markets
- Slashing of government spending
- Union restrictions

Critics called this "shock therapy" applied under conditions of political terror—the "neoliberal experiment" was possible only because dissent had been crushed. Supporters credited the reforms with Chile's later economic growth, though inequality remained extreme.[^21]

## US Involvement

US involvement in the Chilean coup is extensively documented through declassified materials:

### Before the Coup
- **1970:** CIA spent over $3 million supporting anti-Allende forces in the election
- **1970:** Track II operations attempted to instigate a military coup
- **1970-1973:** Economic destabilization; $8+ million to opposition groups, media, and strikers
- **1971:** Nixon ordered the "make the economy scream" policy[^22]

### During the Coup
- CIA maintained close intelligence relationships with coup plotters
- US personnel were aware of coup planning and did not discourage it
- Washington immediately recognized the new junta[^23]

### After the Coup
- US provided $463 million in aid within months
- Continued intelligence cooperation
- Defended regime in international forums
- Henry Kissinger told Pinochet: "We want to help, not undermine you"[^24]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views (Human Rights/Democratic Perspective)

**Allende's Democratic Legacy:** Allende represented the possibility of social transformation through constitutional means—a "peaceful road to socialism" that offered an alternative to violent revolution. His overthrow demonstrated the limits of that path when confronting entrenched interests and superpower opposition.[^25]

**Symbol of Resistance:** Allende's refusal to flee, his final address, and his death in La Moneda made him a martyr to democracy and social justice worldwide. The image of the burning presidential palace became an icon of anti-imperialism.[^26]

**Demand for Justice:** Chile's eventual transition to democracy included significant, if incomplete, efforts at transitional justice—the Rettig and Valech Reports documented the crimes of the dictatorship and provided some measure of accountability.[^27]

### Alternative Views (Cold War/Conservative Perspective)

**Anti-Communist Justification:** Supporters of the coup argued that:
- Allende was leading Chile toward Cuban-style communism
- Economic crisis threatened social order
- Military intervention prevented civil war
- The coup "saved" Chile from totalitarianism[^28]

**Economic "Miracle" Narrative:** Some credited Pinochet's regime with the economic transformation that made Chile one of Latin America's most prosperous countries. This narrative typically downplays or ignores the human rights catastrophe.[^29]

---

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Democratic Transition (1988-1990)

In 1988, under its own constitution, the Pinochet regime held a plebiscite on whether Pinochet should continue in power. In a stunning defeat, 55% voted "No." Democratic elections followed in 1989, and Pinochet transferred power to elected President Patricio Aylwin in March 1990.[^30]

### Justice and Accountability

**Pinochet:** Protected by self-granted amnesty and senatorial immunity, Pinochet evaded justice for years. His 1998 arrest in London on a Spanish warrant made international headlines but he was eventually released on health grounds. He died in 2006 without facing trial.[^31]

**Others Convicted:** Many military officers and DINA agents have been convicted for specific crimes. Trials continue as of 2023.

**2023 50th Anniversary:** Chile marked the 50th anniversary of the coup with renewed debate about its legacy and continued demands for truth about the disappeared.[^32]

### Ongoing Significance

- September 11 remains deeply contested in Chile—for Americans it evokes 2001, but for Chileans it first means 1973
- The "Chicago Boys" model influenced economic policy worldwide
- Chile's experience informed transitional justice practices globally
- 2019 social uprising ("Estallido social") invoked 1973 and led to constitutional reform process[^33]
