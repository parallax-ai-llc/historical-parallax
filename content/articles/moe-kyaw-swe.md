## Summary

Lieutenant General Kyaw Swe is a former Myanmar military officer and government minister who served as Minister of Home Affairs from 2016 to 2020 under the National League for Democracy (NLD) government. Born on November 27, 1959, in Kyaukpadaung Township, Mandalay Division, he rose through military ranks to command the Southwest Military Command before transitioning to ministerial roles. His tenure as Home Affairs Minister coincided with critical periods in Myanmar's democratic transition, including the 2017 Rohingya crisis, and ended when the military removed him for being perceived as too cooperative with civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Kyaw Swe was born on November 27, 1959, to Mya Soe and Daw Kyi in Thepyintaw village, Kyaukpadaung Township, Mandalay Division (now Mandalay Region), Myanmar.[^3] Growing up in central Myanmar during a period of military rule, he entered the Defence Services Academy, Myanmar's premier military training institution located in Pyin Oo Lwin, which prepares officers for all three branches of the armed forces.[^4]

He graduated from the 22nd intake of the Defense Services Academy and later earned a master's degree in defense studies.[^5] The academy's mission to "train a new generation of highly educated and well-rounded officers for Myanmar's armed forces who are capable of leading the nation" shaped his formative military education.[^6] His time at the academy placed him within an influential cohort of military officers who would later occupy key positions in Myanmar's government and military structure. After graduation, Kyaw Swe embarked on a military career that would span several decades and eventually lead him to the highest levels of Myanmar's security apparatus.[^7]

---

## Rise to Power

Kyaw Swe's ascent through the military hierarchy followed a conventional path through various command and administrative positions within the Tatmadaw, Myanmar's armed forces. He served in multiple capacities that demonstrated both his operational capabilities and his aptitude for security affairs. His career progression included service as Commander of the Southwest Military Command based in Pathein, Ayeyarwady Region, where he oversaw military operations in a strategically important delta region.[^8]

A pivotal advancement came when he was appointed Chief of Military Security Affairs, a position that placed him at the center of Myanmar's intelligence and internal security operations.[^9] This role proved critical in establishing his credentials as a trusted figure within the military establishment. In recognition of his service and capabilities, he was appointed principal of the Defense Services Academy, returning to his alma mater in a leadership capacity to shape the next generation of military officers.[^10]

In August 2015, as Myanmar moved toward its first openly contested general election in 25 years, Kyaw Swe was appointed Minister of Border Affairs, serving from August 13, 2015, to March 30, 2016.[^11] This brief ministerial appointment positioned him for a more significant role when the NLD government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, came to power following the November 2015 elections. In March 2016, under the provisions of the 2008 Constitution that reserved the Home Affairs, Defense, and Border Affairs ministries for military appointees, Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing nominated Kyaw Swe as Minister of Home Affairs.[^12] The appointment was approved by President Htin Kyaw and the national legislature, and Kyaw Swe was sworn in as the military's representative overseeing Myanmar's police forces and internal security during a critical democratic transition period.[^13]

## Major Achievements

As Minister of Home Affairs from 2016 to 2020, Kyaw Swe oversaw significant institutional reforms within Myanmar's police force and domestic security apparatus. Upon taking office, he immediately prioritized the development of Myanmar's first-ever National Crime Prevention Strategy (NCPS), stating that "Putting a comprehensive crime prevention strategy into place is one of the top priorities of the new Government."[^14] Working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and supported by UK government funding, the strategy was outlined under four main areas: crime prevention through social development, community-based crime prevention, environment-induced crime prevention, and rehabilitation and reintegration programming.[^15]

Under his leadership, the Myanmar Police Force (MPF) underwent organizational restructuring that included the establishment of several new specialized departments, including aviation, maritime, border, and tourist police units, alongside the acquisition of modern equipment.[^16] The force set ambitious expansion goals to address its understaffing challenges; with 75,000 personnel at the start of his tenure—a ratio of only 120 officers per 100,000 people—the MPF aimed to reach 155,000 personnel by 2020, which would bring the ratio to 256 officers per 100,000, comparable to international standards.[^17]

Kyaw Swe championed a shift toward community-based policing, with the MPF's doctrine and training programs being changed to give greater emphasis to unarmed officers working in close cooperation with the civil population.[^18] In a groundbreaking move in 2016, he issued an official letter to state and region chief ministers indicating that local governments could potentially take control of the management of five departments including police, the Bureau of Special Investigations, Fire Service, Prison Department, and General Administration Department, signaling a willingness to explore civilian oversight of security forces.[^19]

His working relationship with the NLD government was notably cooperative. NLD lawmaker Daw Phyu Phyu Thin stated that he was "liked by the people and cooperative in working with the government," noting improvements in security during his tenure.[^20] Kyaw Swe frequently traveled with State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi on trips around the country, developing what observers characterized as a close working relationship with the civilian leadership—a rarity for a military-appointed minister in Myanmar's hybrid political system.[^21]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Kyaw Swe's tenure as Home Affairs Minister was marred by serious allegations of human rights violations and failures of accountability. Most significantly, he held command responsibility during the 2016-2017 Rohingya crisis in Rakhine State. Myanmar's security forces carried out large-scale attacks against the Rohingya population beginning on October 9, 2016, as part of "clearance operations" following attacks on police border posts.[^22] A second, more devastating phase began in August 2017, resulting in what the United Nations and human rights organizations characterized as ethnic cleansing and potential genocide.[^23]

Human rights organization Fortify Rights specifically identified Kyaw Swe among 22 members of the Tatmadaw and Myanmar Police Force who should be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity against the Rohingya, alongside Commander-in-Chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing and Police Major General Aung Win Oo.[^24] As Home Affairs Minister, Kyaw Swe had oversight responsibility for police operations during the crackdowns, as the police fall under the Ministry of Home Affairs.[^25] The military operations caused at least 6,700 deaths between August and September 2017 and forced over 700,000 people to flee across the border to Bangladesh, with survivors reporting systematic rape, mass killings, and the burning of entire villages.[^26]

The assassination of Ko Ni, a prominent constitutional lawyer and Muslim adviser to the NLD, on January 29, 2017, at Yangon International Airport raised serious questions about security failures and potential complicity.[^27] In a controversial press conference on February 25, 2017, Kyaw Swe characterized the organizers of Ko Ni's killing as being motivated by "extreme patriotism," a statement widely criticized for appearing to justify the murder of a key democratic reformer.[^28] Although the Home Affairs Ministry denied allegations that Kyaw Swe orchestrated the killing, the investigation's failure to apprehend all suspects, particularly retired lieutenant colonel Aung Win Khine who remains at large, raised persistent concerns about whether the full truth was revealed.[^29]

The December 12, 2017 arrest of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo became an international scandal. Kyaw Swe approved an order to prosecute the journalists under Article 3(1)(c) of the Official Secrets Act after they investigated the Inn Din massacre, where security forces killed ten Rohingya Muslim men and boys.[^30] A police captain later testified in court that the arrest was a case of entrapment, with his superior arranging for two policemen to hand over documents described as "important secret papers" to trap the reporters.[^31] The journalists were sentenced to seven years in prison, drawing international condemnation and severely damaging Myanmar's reputation for press freedom.[^32]

Additional controversies included the violent suppression of protests in Karenni State in July 2018, where police tased and baton-charged demonstrators, and the killing of seven ethnic Rakhine protesters by police in Mrauk U, Rakhine State, in January 2018.[^33] Between July 2018 and February 2019, police arrested 82 peaceful protesters in Loikaw related to demonstrations against a government statue and calls for ethnic rights.[^34] These incidents, combined with the broader failures to ensure accountability, badly damaged public confidence in the integrity of the Myanmar Police Force during Kyaw Swe's tenure.[^35]

## Personal Life

Details about Lieutenant General Kyaw Swe's personal life remain largely private, as is typical for senior military officers in Myanmar. He was born to Mya Soe and Daw Kyi in the rural village of Thepyintaw in Kyaukpadaung Township, suggesting a modest family background.[^36] Public records do not contain information about his wife, children, or other family members, reflecting the Myanmar military's traditional practice of maintaining strict privacy regarding the personal lives of senior officers.[^37]

During his time as Home Affairs Minister, Kyaw Swe's personality was characterized by colleagues as cooperative and pragmatic, particularly in his dealings with the civilian NLD government.[^38] His willingness to work closely with State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi—to the extent that he notably saluted her, a gesture that broke with military protocol and signaled deference to civilian authority—revealed a flexibility uncommon among military-appointed ministers.[^39] This comportment ultimately contributed to his removal, as the military leadership viewed such closeness to the civilian government as problematic and potentially undermining military prerogatives.[^40]

His educational background included not only his military training at the Defense Services Academy but also advanced studies resulting in a master's degree in defense, indicating intellectual ambitions beyond purely operational military concerns.[^41] As principal of the Defense Services Academy, he would have been responsible for shaping curriculum and training standards for future officers, suggesting pedagogical interests and influence over military culture.[^42]

---

## Legacy

Kyaw Swe's legacy remains deeply contested and reflects the contradictions of Myanmar's troubled democratic transition period. His four-year tenure as Home Affairs Minister occurred during a unique moment when military-appointed ministers worked alongside a democratically elected civilian government, creating unprecedented opportunities for reform but also exposing fundamental tensions in Myanmar's hybrid political system.[^43]

On the positive side, he is remembered for genuine efforts to modernize and reform Myanmar's police force, including the development of the nation's first comprehensive crime prevention strategy and the expansion of community-based policing initiatives.[^44] His cooperative approach toward the NLD government represented a departure from the traditional military stance of antagonism toward civilian authority, offering a model—however imperfect—for civil-military cooperation.[^45] NLD parliamentarians who worked with him praised his willingness to engage constructively with civilian officials and his efforts to improve security services.[^46]

However, these achievements are fundamentally overshadowed by his oversight of security forces during the Rohingya crisis, one of the most serious humanitarian catastrophes of the 21st century. His command responsibility for police operations during the 2016-2017 crackdowns in Rakhine State, which resulted in mass atrocities that international bodies have characterized as ethnic cleansing and potential genocide, remains his most significant and damning legacy.[^47] Human rights organizations continue to call for his investigation and potential prosecution for crimes against humanity.[^48]

The circumstances of his departure from office in early 2020 also contribute to his legacy's complexity. The military removed him specifically because he was perceived as too close to Aung San Suu Kyi and the civilian government, with analysts noting that "the military has viewed former minister Kyaw Swe as being too close to Aung San Suu Kyi, especially because he saluted her."[^49] This removal foreshadowed the military's broader dissatisfaction with the NLD government, which culminated in the February 2021 coup d'état.[^50]

Following his retirement from the Home Affairs Ministry, Kyaw Swe joined the military's auxiliary forces, maintaining his connection to the Tatmadaw as Myanmar descended into civil war after the 2021 coup.[^51] His career thus encapsulates the broader tragedy of Myanmar's failed democratic transition: a military officer who showed some willingness to work within a democratic framework, but who ultimately could not escape—or chose not to challenge—the military's role in perpetrating mass atrocities against civilian populations.[^52]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and some observers credit Kyaw Swe with making genuine attempts to reform Myanmar's police force during a challenging transitional period. The National Crime Prevention Strategy he championed represented Myanmar's first systematic approach to crime prevention based on international best practices, with support from the UNODC and incorporating community-based policing principles that represented a significant departure from the purely authoritarian policing model of previous military regimes.[^53]

His cooperative relationship with the NLD government was seen by some as evidence of pragmatic military officers who recognized the need for civil-military cooperation in Myanmar's democratic transition. NLD lawmakers publicly praised his willingness to work constructively with civilian authorities, with Daw Phyu Phyu Thin expressing hope that his successor would follow his collaborative approach.[^54] His effort to offer local governments control over police and other security departments, though ultimately not fully implemented, showed at least rhetorical commitment to decentralization and civilian oversight principles.[^55]

Some analysts view his removal in 2020 as evidence that he was insufficiently aligned with hardline military elements, suggesting he occupied a more moderate position within the military hierarchy. His practice of saluting Aung San Suu Kyi and frequently accompanying her on official trips indicated respect for civilian authority that distinguished him from many of his military colleagues.[^56] In this interpretation, Kyaw Swe represents a missed opportunity—a military officer who might have served as a bridge between military and civilian institutions had Myanmar's democratic transition not been derailed by the 2021 coup.[^57]

### Negative Views

Critics and human rights organizations emphasize that any positive assessments of Kyaw Swe's tenure must be weighed against his command responsibility for one of the most serious humanitarian crises of recent decades. Fortify Rights, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and other organizations have documented systematic atrocities committed by forces under his nominal oversight, including the Myanmar Police Force, during the 2016-2017 Rohingya crisis.[^58]

The characterization of Ko Ni's assassins as motivated by "extreme patriotism" revealed, in this view, an alignment with ultranationalist elements within Myanmar's security establishment rather than a commitment to democratic values or rule of law.[^59] Critics note that calling murderers of a prominent Muslim lawyer and democratic reformer "extremely patriotic" effectively legitimized political assassination and reflected deep-seated prejudices within the military establishment that Kyaw Swe either shared or was unwilling to challenge.[^60]

The approval to prosecute Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo for investigating the Inn Din massacre demonstrates, according to critics, a fundamental unwillingness to allow accountability for military crimes.[^61] The fact that police under his authority entrapped the journalists in what a police witness admitted was a setup operation reveals systematic efforts to suppress journalism and maintain impunity for security forces.[^62]

Scholars of Myanmar's transition argue that Kyaw Swe's cooperative relationship with the NLD government was ultimately superficial and did not translate into meaningful reforms or accountability. Police reforms remained largely cosmetic, with human rights abuses continuing throughout his tenure, including violent crackdowns on ethnic minority protesters and persistent torture by security forces.[^63] His willingness to work with Aung San Suu Kyi, these critics contend, reflected tactical accommodation of the civilian government while preserving military prerogatives and protecting the institution from accountability.[^64]

Ultimately, critics argue that Kyaw Swe's legacy exemplifies the failure of Myanmar's attempted democratic transition and the impossibility of achieving meaningful reform while military officers retained control over security ministries and operated with impunity for mass atrocities.[^65]
