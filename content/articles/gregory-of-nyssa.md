## Summary

Gregory of Nyssa was a Cappadocian Father and younger brother of Basil of Caesarea. He was one of the most original thinkers in early Christianity, contributing to mystical theology and Trinitarian doctrine. His concept of epektasis — endless spiritual growth — influenced Eastern Christian mysticism. He also championed universal salvation (apokatastasis).
