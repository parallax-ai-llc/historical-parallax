## Summary
Charles Edmund Cullen was an American serial killer and former nurse who is believed to have murdered up to 400 patients across 16 years at various hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He administered lethal doses of medications, primarily digoxin. He pleaded guilty to 29 murders in 2004.

## Early Life
Born February 22, 1960, in West Orange, New Jersey. He suffered childhood abuse and made multiple suicide attempts. He trained as a nurse and worked at numerous hospitals, frequently being fired or resigning under suspicious circumstances. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1988 and 2003, Cullen worked at 10 hospitals across New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He killed patients by administering lethal doses of medications, particularly digoxin and insulin. Despite numerous complaints and suspicious incidents, hospitals often let him resign quietly and gave neutral references, allowing him to continue working. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Cullen was arrested on December 12, 2003, after a co-worker at Somerset Medical Center became suspicious and reported him. He confessed and pleaded guilty to 29 murders, though investigators believe the true toll may be as high as 400. He was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His case led to sweeping healthcare hiring reform laws [^4]
- New Jersey passed 'Cullen's Law' requiring hospitals to share employee records
- Led to improved medication tracking systems in hospitals

## Negative Perspectives
- Believed to have killed up to 400 patients [^5]
- Hospitals repeatedly allowed him to resign rather than face investigation
- Exploited the trust placed in healthcare workers
- His mobility between hospitals showed catastrophic systemic failures
- Murdered the most vulnerable — hospitalized patients
