## Summary

Philip Fisher was a pioneering growth investor whose book 'Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits' (1958) became a classic of investment literature. He advocated investing in well-managed companies with strong growth prospects and holding them long-term. Warren Buffett has said he is '85% Benjamin Graham and 15% Philip Fisher.' His 'scuttlebutt' method of researching companies through industry contacts influenced generations of investors.
