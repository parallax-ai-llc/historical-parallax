## Summary

Alfred Blalock performed the first Blalock-Taussig shunt in 1944, a surgery that saved 'blue babies' with tetralogy of Fallot. His surgical technician Vivien Thomas, an African American, developed the procedure but was largely unrecognized due to racial discrimination. Blalock's work opened the field of cardiac surgery.
