## Summary

U Pe Myint (born December 15, 1949) is a Myanmar politician, journalist, writer, and former Minister for Information who served in the National League for Democracy (NLD) government from 2016 to 2021.[^1] Born in Thandwe, Rakhine State, he began his career as a medical doctor before transitioning to journalism and literature in 1988.[^2] A National Literature Award winner and prolific translator of self-help books, Pe Myint co-founded the Do Ayay newspaper and famously interviewed Aung San Suu Kyi after her historic 1988 speech, introducing her political views to the Myanmar public.[^3] His tenure as Information Minister was marked by significant controversy over press freedom, patriotic journalism, and the government's handling of the Rohingya crisis.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

U Pe Myint was born on December 15, 1949, in Sandoway (now Thandwe), a coastal town in Rakhine State, Myanmar, to parents Aung Nyein and Khin Thein.[^5] He is of Rakhine descent, belonging to one of Myanmar's major ethnic groups with a distinct cultural heritage and language traditions.[^6] Growing up in Rakhine State during the post-independence period, Pe Myint witnessed Myanmar's transition from British colonial rule and the subsequent political turbulence that characterized the early decades of the nation.

Pe Myint received his early education at Thandwe State High School in Rakhine State, graduating in 1966 during a period of significant political change in Myanmar.[^7] His academic excellence led him to pursue higher education in medicine at the prestigious Institute of Medicine 1 in Rangoon (now Yangon), one of Myanmar's leading medical schools.[^8] He graduated in 1975 with a medical degree, embarking on what would initially seem to be a lifelong career in healthcare.[^9]

During his formative years, Myanmar was under military rule following the 1962 coup led by General Ne Win, which established the "Burmese Way to Socialism."[^10] This political environment, characterized by isolationist policies, economic decline, and strict government control over media and expression, would profoundly influence Pe Myint's later career choices and political perspectives. Despite the repressive atmosphere, Pe Myint developed a deep interest in literature and writing, reading widely in both Burmese and translated foreign works.[^11]

After completing his medical education, Pe Myint worked as a general physician, treating patients across Myanmar for approximately 13 years.[^12] However, his passion for literature and writing continued to grow during this period. He began translating foreign literary works, starting with classic novellas by Russian authors Anton Chekhov and Ivan Turgenev, which would establish his reputation as a skilled translator and introduce Myanmar readers to world literature.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Pe Myint's transition from medicine to journalism and literature occurred during one of Myanmar's most transformative periods—the 8888 Uprising of 1988.[^14] At age 40, he made the significant decision to leave his medical practice and pursue his true calling in journalism and writing.[^15] He received professional training as a journalist at the Indochina Media Memorial Foundation in Bangkok, equipping himself with the skills necessary to navigate Myanmar's complex media landscape.[^16]

In 1988, Pe Myint co-founded the Do Ayay newspaper alongside U Myo Nyunt and U Myo Myint Nyein, establishing one of the independent media outlets that emerged during the brief period of political opening following the 8888 Uprising.[^17] Through this newspaper, Pe Myint conducted a historic interview with Aung San Suu Kyi about her political beliefs shortly after her famous speech at Shwedagon Pagoda on August 26, 1988.[^18] This interview was groundbreaking, as Pe Myint later noted: "Before his article, people only knew that she was the General's daughter."[^19] The interview helped introduce Aung San Suu Kyi's democratic vision to the Myanmar public and established Pe Myint's reputation as a serious political journalist.

Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, Pe Myint built a distinguished career in journalism and publishing. He served as editor-in-chief of The People's Age Journal, a political publication where he critically analyzed government policies and advocated for democratic reforms.[^20] He also worked as an editor for two prominent publishing houses—Sarpaylawka Book House and Myanmar Book Publishing House—where he championed both original Myanmar literature and translated works.[^21]

Pe Myint's literary career flourished during this period. In 1995, he won the prestigious Myanmar National Literature Award for his collection "Parts for Sale and Other Short Stories," cementing his status as one of Myanmar's leading contemporary writers.[^22] His translations of self-help books, including George Samuel Clason's "The Richest Man in Babylon" (1997) and other motivational works like "Think Like a Leader," became bestsellers in Myanmar and introduced new genres to Myanmar readers.[^23]

In 1998, Pe Myint received international recognition when he was selected to participate in the International Writing Program at the University of Iowa, joining writers from around the world for a prestigious literary residency.[^24] This experience broadened his international perspective and connections within the global literary community.

Pe Myint's involvement in Myanmar's media sector deepened as he became vice chairman of the Myanmar Press Council, an organization established to protect journalists' rights and promote press freedom.[^25] In this role, he advocated for media reform and greater protection for journalists working under Myanmar's restrictive media laws.

When the National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in the 2015 elections, ending decades of military-dominated rule, Pe Myint's combination of journalistic credentials, literary reputation, and commitment to democratic values made him an attractive candidate for a ministerial position.[^26] On March 22, 2016, President Htin Kyaw nominated Pe Myint to serve as Minister for Information, and the Assembly of the Union confirmed his nomination on March 24, 2016.[^27] The cabinet was sworn in on March 30, 2016, marking the beginning of Pe Myint's controversial tenure as Information Minister.[^28]

## Major Achievements

As Minister for Information from 2016 to 2021, Pe Myint oversaw several significant initiatives aimed at modernizing Myanmar's media landscape and government communications infrastructure.[^29] Upon taking office, he pledged to "ensure press freedom" and promised to review restrictive media laws, particularly the Broadcasting Law, stating he would "consider the views of those who want to do broadcasting, existing broadcasters, the realities, the input of scholars and situations in other countries."[^30]

One of Pe Myint's key initiatives was reforming state-run broadcasting services, which had long served as propaganda tools under military rule.[^31] According to the reform plan he developed, MRTV would reduce its information programming ratio from 60 percent to 45 percent while increasing entertainment programming from 20 percent to 35 percent, representing a significant shift in state media's approach.[^32] Under his leadership, Myanmar's government systematically carried out state media reforms as part of its 100-day program after taking office, with Pe Myint emphasizing that state media should "act as a bridge between the government and the public."[^33]

Pe Myint initiated plans to introduce five additional television channels in Myanmar, expanding broadcasting options and diversifying media content available to Myanmar citizens.[^34] He also discussed the development of an English-language TV channel, recognizing the importance of international communication and Myanmar's engagement with the global community.[^35] These broadcasting expansions represented significant infrastructure investments in Myanmar's media sector.

The Ministry of Information under Pe Myint's leadership adopted the motto "To inform, educate and entertain the public," signaling a shift away from purely propagandistic functions toward serving citizens' information needs.[^36] He emphasized that "a government needs to inform the people" about its activities and policies, articulating a vision of transparent governance that contrasted with Myanmar's authoritarian past.[^37]

Pe Myint maintained his literary career while serving as Information Minister, continuing to write and engage with Myanmar's literary community. His ongoing publications and public discussions about literature helped maintain cultural connections between the government and Myanmar's intellectual class.[^38] During a Digital Platforms and Future Direction of Book Industry Webinar, Pe Myint shared his views on how digital media was affecting print literature, demonstrating his continued engagement with evolving media technologies.[^39]

Under Pe Myint's tenure, Myanmar participated in regional and international media development conferences and exchanges. In one notable instance, he paid a courtesy visit to Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) Minister, discussing media cooperation and cultural exchange between Myanmar and Japan.[^40] These international engagements aimed to position Myanmar's media sector within broader regional and global networks.

Pe Myint served continuously as Information Minister through the transition from President Htin Kyaw to President Win Myint in 2018, maintaining policy continuity in the information sector.[^41] He navigated the complex political environment of Myanmar's quasi-democratic period, balancing civilian government authority with continued military influence through constitutional provisions that guaranteed military control over key ministries.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his initial promises to ensure press freedom, Pe Myint's tenure as Information Minister became increasingly controversial, with media freedom organizations and journalists criticizing his positions and policies.[^42] His performance disappointed many who had expected that a former journalist and Myanmar Press Council vice chairman would champion media reform.

One of the most significant controversies involved Pe Myint's defense of the arrest and imprisonment of Reuters journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were investigating the Inn Din massacre of Rohingya Muslims.[^43] The two journalists were arrested on December 12, 2017, in what they described as a police setup, and were subsequently sentenced to seven years in prison under the colonial-era Official Secrets Act.[^44] The case drew international condemnation and highlighted the continued risks facing journalists in Myanmar. While President Win Myint eventually pardoned the journalists in May 2019, Pe Myint's ministry had defended the prosecution throughout the trial period.[^45]

Pe Myint sparked outrage among media professionals when he suggested that journalists should prioritize patriotism in their reporting. He stated that journalists should not forget "their duty to protect and love their country," a comment that sixteen media and civil society organizations condemned as "against journalism ethics and hinders press freedom."[^46] The Myanmar Journalist Network, PEN Myanmar, and other groups released a statement criticizing Pe Myint's remarks, arguing that they represented a fundamental misunderstanding of journalism's role in a democratic society.[^47]

During the Rohingya crisis of 2017-2018, when Myanmar's military conducted operations that the United Nations later characterized as genocide, state media under Pe Myint's oversight "repeatedly attacked foreign news outlets for what it described as biased coverage of the military crackdown against Muslim-majority Rohingya."[^48] This defensive posture damaged Myanmar's international reputation and drew criticism from human rights organizations worldwide.

Pe Myint aggressively challenged international press freedom rankings, accusing organizations like Reporters Without Borders of bias. He claimed that Reporters Without Borders "is not an independent organisation but operates with support from the French government" and that its leading members "held European opinions," which he suggested amounted to bias.[^49] When Myanmar fell six places in the World Press Freedom Index in 2018 to 137 out of 180 countries—partly due to the Reuters journalists case—Pe Myint dismissed the findings as politically motivated.[^50]

At a December 2018 conference, Pe Myint rejected criticism that Myanmar was backpedaling on media freedom, stating: "I've been hearing that our country is deprived of media freedom, even more so now than it was under the previous government."[^51] He advised critics to "avoid blaming the government indiscriminately" and questioned the reliability of international reports on freedom of expression in Myanmar.[^52] Sixteen media and civil society organizations protested these comments, releasing a statement saying Pe Myint had ignored research-based explanations of deteriorating media freedom.[^53]

Critics noted the irony that Pe Myint, who as chief editor of Pyithu Khit political journal had criticized previous governments for using state-run media as propaganda, now defended the continued existence of state-run media.[^54] Former Information Minister U Ye Htut expressed shock at the NLD government's relationship with private media, noting that Pe Myint "was the one who once said state-run newspapers should not exist."[^55] An Irrawaddy opinion piece accused Pe Myint of embracing "the propaganda machine he inherited" rather than dismantling it.[^56]

In May 2018, PEN Myanmar and eighteen civil society partners gave the NLD government a score of two out of sixty possible points for its second-year performance on free expression, citing "restrictive laws, defamation lawsuits and imprisonments, the regression of free expression in the digital sphere, dominance of state and military-owned media, powerful joint-ventures between the state and its business cronies, and a generalized failure to prioritize media reform and free expression."[^57] Media freedom advocates strongly criticized the government for its failure to reform state-run media, which had "served as the government's mouthpiece since the early 1960s."[^58]

## Personal Life

U Pe Myint is married to Khaing Nwe Oo, a book publisher who shares his passion for literature and the publishing industry.[^59] Their marriage represents a partnership built on common professional interests and cultural values. Together, they have two children: Pe Zaw Oo and Cho Su Su Khaing.[^60] His family has maintained a relatively private life despite Pe Myint's high-profile political position, avoiding the public spotlight that often accompanies ministerial roles.

Pe Myint's personal interests have consistently centered on literature, writing, and reading. Colleagues and friends describe him as an avid reader with an extensive personal library spanning Myanmar literature, world classics, and contemporary non-fiction, particularly in the self-help and motivational genres.[^61] His translation work reflects his reading preferences, as he selected books he believed would benefit Myanmar readers by introducing new ideas and perspectives.

Those who worked with Pe Myint during his medical career remember him as a dedicated physician who genuinely cared for his patients.[^62] His decision to leave medicine at age 40 after 13 years of practice was driven by a deep conviction that he could make a greater contribution to Myanmar society through writing and journalism than through medical practice. This career transition required considerable personal courage, as it meant abandoning financial security and professional status for an uncertain future in Myanmar's restricted media environment.

Pe Myint's writing style is characterized by clarity, accessibility, and a focus on practical wisdom—qualities that made his original short stories and translated works popular among Myanmar readers.[^63] His short story collection "Parts for Sale and Other Short Stories," which won the National Literature Award, explores themes of ordinary people navigating Myanmar's social and economic challenges with dignity and resilience.

As a person of Rakhine ethnicity, Pe Myint maintained connections to his home state throughout his career, though his political role during the Rohingya crisis—which primarily affected Rakhine State—placed him in a difficult position between his ethnic community and international humanitarian concerns.[^64] This tension between ethnic identity and political responsibility added complexity to his personal experience as Information Minister during this turbulent period.

Pe Myint's participation in the 1998 International Writing Program at the University of Iowa exposed him to diverse international perspectives and global literary traditions.[^65] He formed friendships with writers from various countries and cultures, broadening his worldview beyond Myanmar's relatively isolated environment. These international experiences influenced his later approach to media policy and cross-cultural communication.

## Legacy

U Pe Myint's legacy remains deeply contested, reflecting the contradictions and complexities of Myanmar's difficult democratic transition period from 2016 to 2021.[^66] His career trajectory—from physician to journalist, from dissident writer to government minister—embodies both the possibilities and limitations of Myanmar's attempted democratic reforms under the NLD government.

In Myanmar's literary and cultural spheres, Pe Myint is remembered as a significant figure who enriched Myanmar literature through both original works and translations.[^67] His introduction of motivational and self-help literature created new genres in Myanmar publishing and influenced generations of readers seeking personal development resources. The National Literature Award he received in 1995 acknowledged his contributions to Myanmar's literary heritage, and his works continue to be read and studied.[^68]

Pe Myint's role in documenting the early days of Myanmar's democracy movement, particularly through his historic 1988 interview with Aung San Suu Kyi, secured his place in Myanmar's modern political history.[^69] This interview, conducted through the Do Ayay newspaper he co-founded, helped introduce Aung San Suu Kyi's political vision to the Myanmar public and contributed to her emergence as the democracy movement's iconic leader. For this contribution alone, Pe Myint earned recognition as an important chronicler of Myanmar's democratic aspirations.

However, Pe Myint's legacy as Information Minister is far more problematic. Media freedom advocates view his tenure as a missed opportunity and a betrayal of the principles he ostensibly championed as a journalist and Myanmar Press Council vice chairman.[^70] His defense of state media, attacks on international press freedom organizations, calls for patriotic journalism, and failure to prevent the prosecution of the Reuters journalists damaged his reputation among those who had hoped he would champion meaningful media reform.

The broader question of Pe Myint's legacy relates to the NLD government's overall performance and the challenges of governing Myanmar's quasi-democratic system, where the military retained control over key ministries and wielded enormous political power.[^71] Sympathetic observers argue that Pe Myint faced impossible constraints and that meaningful media reform was blocked by military interests and conservative forces within Myanmar's power structure. Critics counter that he too readily accommodated these constraints rather than fighting for the reforms he had once advocated.

The February 1, 2021 military coup, which removed Pe Myint from office along with other NLD government officials, abruptly ended his ministerial career and provided a stark reminder of the fragility of Myanmar's democratic experiment.[^72] The military's appointment of former officer U Chit Naing as Pe Myint's successor, along with the addition of Tatmadaw spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun as deputy information minister, signaled a return to overt military control over information and media.[^73] In this context, Pe Myint's tenure—despite its shortcomings—represented at least a civilian presence in the Information Ministry, something that disappeared with the coup.

Pe Myint's contributions to Myanmar's publishing industry, through his work with Sarpaylawka Book House and Myanmar Book Publishing House, helped develop the infrastructure and editorial standards that continue to shape Myanmar's book publishing sector.[^74] His championing of both original Myanmar literature and quality translations set standards that subsequent editors and publishers have followed.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters of U Pe Myint emphasize his courageous career transition from medicine to journalism during Myanmar's 1988 uprising, when joining independent media required considerable personal risk.[^75] His decision to abandon a stable medical career to pursue journalism and writing demonstrated commitment to democratic values and freedom of expression during an extremely repressive period in Myanmar's history.

Scholars of Myanmar literature recognize Pe Myint's significant contributions to the country's literary development through both original creative works and translations that introduced Myanmar readers to world literature and new genres.[^76] His translation of works by Chekhov and Turgenev, along with self-help books like "The Richest Man in Babylon," expanded the horizons of Myanmar readers and contributed to cultural exchange between Myanmar and other societies. The National Literature Award he received validated his literary merit and established his reputation as a serious writer.

Defenders of Pe Myint's ministerial tenure argue that he operated within severe constraints imposed by Myanmar's military-drafted 2008 Constitution, which guaranteed military control over key security ministries and gave the Tatmadaw enormous political power.[^77] According to this perspective, meaningful media reform required constitutional changes that the NLD government lacked the power to implement, and Pe Myint made incremental improvements where possible, such as adjusting the programming ratios on state television to include more entertainment and less propaganda.

Some Myanmar political analysts suggest that Pe Myint's attempts to defend Myanmar's international reputation during the Rohingya crisis, while poorly executed and morally questionable, reflected genuine nationalist sentiment rather than mere propaganda.[^78] This perspective holds that Pe Myint, like many in Myanmar's Buddhist majority population, believed that international media coverage of the Rohingya situation was one-sided and failed to adequately represent Myanmar's complex ethnic conflicts and security concerns.

Pe Myint's historic 1988 interview with Aung San Suu Kyi established him as an important documenter of Myanmar's democracy movement, and this contribution to Myanmar's political history represents an enduring achievement regardless of his later controversies.[^79] The interview helped introduce Aung San Suu Kyi to the Myanmar public as a political figure with substantive ideas rather than merely as "the General's daughter," playing a crucial role in launching her political career.

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Pe Myint's tenure as Information Minister represented a betrayal of the press freedom principles he had previously championed as a journalist and Myanmar Press Council vice chairman.[^80] His calls for "patriotic journalism," defense of state media, and attacks on international press freedom organizations contradicted the positions he had taken earlier in his career when criticizing military government control of media.

Media freedom organizations harshly condemned Pe Myint's performance, with Reporters Without Borders and other groups documenting Myanmar's decline in press freedom rankings during his tenure.[^81] The assessment by PEN Myanmar and eighteen civil society partners giving the NLD government only two out of sixty possible points for its second-year performance on free expression represented a devastating critique of Pe Myint's failure to deliver promised reforms.[^82]

The Reuters journalists case stands as the most damning indictment of Pe Myint's ministerial record.[^83] His ministry's defense of the prosecution of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo—who were investigating massacres of Rohingya civilians—demonstrated a willingness to prioritize government interests over journalistic freedom and the public's right to know. The international condemnation of their imprisonment, including the Pulitzer Prize they received while incarcerated, highlighted the moral and professional failure this case represented.[^84]

Human rights advocates view Pe Myint's role during the Rohingya crisis as particularly troubling, noting that state media under his oversight consistently defended military actions that the United Nations and independent investigators later characterized as genocide.[^85] His attacks on international media covering the crisis and his framing of coverage as biased against Myanmar made him complicit, critics argue, in attempts to obscure serious human rights violations.

Former allies in Myanmar's media sector expressed disappointment and anger at what they perceived as Pe Myint's abandonment of reform principles once he gained ministerial power.[^86] Former Information Minister U Ye Htut's pointed comment that Pe Myint "was the one who once said state-run newspapers should not exist" captured the sense of betrayal felt by those who had expected him to champion media transformation. An Irrawaddy commentary's accusation that Pe Myint embraced "the propaganda machine he inherited" reflected widespread disappointment among media professionals.[^87]

Scholarly analyses of Myanmar's failed democratic transition increasingly point to the civilian government's accommodation of military interests and failure to push for meaningful institutional reforms as contributing factors to the 2021 coup.[^88] In this analytical framework, Pe Myint's tenure exemplifies how NLD ministers prioritized political survival over transformative change, ultimately failing to build the democratic institutions necessary to resist military takeover.
