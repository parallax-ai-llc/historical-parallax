## Summary

Nikolaus Otto built the first practical four-stroke internal combustion engine in 1876, known as the Otto cycle engine. His invention became the basis for most automobile engines and transformed transportation and industry. The four-stroke cycle he perfected — intake, compression, power, exhaust — remains the operating principle of most gas engines.
