## Summary

Dipa Nusantara Aidit (born Ahmad Aidit; 30 July 1923 – 22 November 1965) was an Indonesian communist politician who served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) from 1951 until his summary execution during the mass killings of 1965–66.[^1] Under his leadership, the PKI experienced remarkable growth, transforming from a marginal organization of 3,000-5,000 members in 1950 to become the largest political party in Indonesia and the third-largest communist party in the world by 1965, with more than 20 million members and active supporters.[^2] Aidit's political career ended abruptly when he was captured and executed on 22 November 1965 following the failed 30 September Movement, an event that triggered one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century.[^3] His legacy remains deeply controversial in Indonesian history, with debates continuing about his actual role in the events that led to the destruction of the PKI and the deaths of hundreds of thousands of suspected communists.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ahmad Aidit was born on 30 July 1923 in Tanjung Pandan, Belitung Island, Indonesia, during the Dutch colonial period.[^5] He was the first son of four children born to Abdullah Aidit and Mailan.[^6] His father, Abdullah Aidit, was a prominent figure in the anti-colonial movement and founder of Nurul Islam, an Islamic education organization that continues to exist today.[^7] His mother, Mailan, came from a noble (Ningrat) family background, providing the young Aidit with exposure to both religious education and aristocratic traditions.[^8]

Ahmad and his siblings initially attended the Hollandsche Inlandsch School, a Dutch-administered school for indigenous Indonesians.[^9] In early 1936, at his own insistence, the thirteen-year-old Ahmad convinced his father to allow him to continue his studies in Batavia (now Jakarta), demonstrating the ambition and determination that would characterize his later political career.[^10] In the capital, he attended Middestand Handel School (Middle Commercial School) after finding that registration for the more prestigious Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs had already closed.[^11]

During his formative years in Jakarta, young Ahmad became politically active, joining Persatuan Timur Muda under Gerindo (Indonesian People's Movement), led by Amir Sjarifudin and Adnan Kapau Gani, eventually rising to become its chairman.[^12] It was during this period that Ahmad changed his name to Dipa Nusantara, which translates to "the nation's guardian" or "guardian of the archipelago."[^13] According to some sources, this name change served multiple purposes: it reflected his growing political consciousness and nationalist identity, and it helped conceal his family descent, which his father had initially rejected.[^14] The abbreviated form "D.N. Aidit" would become his political identity, though it was sometimes mistaken for another prominent figure, Djafar Nawawi.[^15]

During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942-1945), Aidit's political education deepened significantly. At Asrama Menteng 31, a boarding house for young Indonesian nationalists, D.N. Aidit and his contemporaries received political lectures from Indonesia's founding fathers, including Sukarno, Mohammad Hatta, Amir Sjarifudin, Achmad Subardjo, and Ki Hajar Dewantoro.[^16] This exposure to Indonesia's leading nationalist and leftist thinkers during his late teens and early twenties profoundly shaped Aidit's political ideology and revolutionary consciousness. It was also during the Japanese occupation, in 1943, that the twenty-year-old Aidit joined the Communist Party of Indonesia while it was still poorly organized and operating illegally.[^17]

---

## Rise to Power

Aidit's ascent within the Indonesian Communist Party occurred during one of the most turbulent periods in the organization's history. After the failed Madiun Affair of 1948—a communist uprising that was brutally suppressed by the Indonesian government—the PKI was in disarray, with many of its leaders killed or imprisoned.[^18] Aidit and his colleague M.H. Lukman managed to escape to China and Vietnam, where they spent time in exile studying communist theory and observing revolutionary movements firsthand.[^19]

In July 1950, Aidit returned to Indonesia and immediately began working to rebuild the shattered communist movement.[^20] At just twenty-seven years old, he was elected First Secretary (later General Secretary) of the PKI during the Central Committee meeting in January 1951, making him one of the youngest leaders of a major communist party in the world.[^21] This appointment marked a generational shift within the PKI, as Aidit represented a new cohort of leaders untainted by the failures of the Madiun Affair.

Aidit's leadership strategy differed dramatically from his predecessors. Rather than pursuing revolutionary armed struggle, he adopted what he called the "peaceful road to socialism," emphasizing parliamentary participation, mass organizing, and collaboration with President Sukarno's nationalist government.[^22] This pragmatic approach, sometimes criticized by more radical communists, proved remarkably effective. Between January 1951 and March 1954, the number of full members of the PKI increased tenfold.[^23] Under Aidit's direction, the party grew from approximately 3,000-5,000 members in 1950 to 165,000 in 1954, and then to 1.5 million by 1959.[^24]

The 1955 general elections marked a major breakthrough for Aidit and the PKI. The party finished fourth overall, securing 16 percent of the vote with nearly two million supporters, winning 39 seats in parliament and 80 seats in the Constituent Assembly.[^25] In East Java, a PKI stronghold, almost 30 percent of votes were cast for the party.[^26] During the 1955 campaign, Aidit demonstrated remarkable oratorical skills and drew large, enthusiastic crowds.[^27] The 1957 local elections saw continued momentum, with Aidit claiming a 45 percent increase over the 1955 results.[^28]

Aidit's strategic genius lay in his ability to navigate Indonesia's complex political landscape. He developed a close working relationship with President Sukarno, supporting the president's concept of "Guided Democracy" and the Nasakom (Nasionalisme, Agama, Komunisme—nationalism, religion, communism) ideology that aimed to unite Indonesia's main political currents.[^29] Though a Marxist, Aidit submitted to Sukarno's Marhaenism policy, allowing the party to grow without openly threatening to seize power, and in return for his support, he rose to become one of Sukarno's coordinating ministers.[^30] In June 1960, Aidit was appointed deputy chairman of the Mutual Cooperation – People's Representative Council and the Provisional People's Representative Council, giving the PKI unprecedented access to state power.[^31]

## Major Achievements

### Organizational Transformation

Aidit's most significant achievement was the transformation of the PKI from a marginal, persecuted organization into the largest political party in Indonesia and the third-largest communist party in the world.[^32] At the fifth party congress in 1954, Aidit was only 31 years old, yet within a year or two, he had made the PKI one of the top four political parties in Indonesia.[^33] By August 1965, the PKI claimed more than 20 million members and active supporters when including affiliated mass organizations, surpassing all communist parties worldwide except those in the Soviet Union and China.[^34]

This growth was not merely numerical but structural. Aidit implemented comprehensive party reorganization, establishing clear hierarchies, improving discipline, and creating an extensive network of local branches throughout the Indonesian archipelago.[^35] Under his revolutionary programs as General Secretary, the PKI consolidated its foundation in the 1955 election and continued expanding its influence through systematic grassroots organizing.[^36]

### Mass Organizations and Social Programs

Aidit recognized that the PKI's strength depended on building a broad social movement beyond the party itself. He oversaw the development of powerful affiliated organizations that mobilized different sectors of Indonesian society. These included Pemuda Rakyat (People's Youth), Gerwani (Indonesian Women's Movement), Barisan Tani Indonesia or BTI (Indonesian Peasants' Front), and Lekra (Institute of People's Culture).[^37]

The PKI's education programs represented a remarkable social achievement. These community-based programs were "actually far more successful in educating illiterate workers and farmers than underfunded state schools or private Islamic boarding schools."[^38] This educational work was part of Aidit's broader vision: the PKI was more than just a political party with an economic agenda; it represented a social and cultural revolution.[^39]

### Agrarian Reform Advocacy

In 1953, D.N. Aidit launched his comprehensive analysis of Indonesian agrarian society, arguing that agrarian revolution must be the essence of the people's "democratic revolution" in Indonesia.[^40] At the fifth party congress in 1954, the PKI adopted Aidit's analysis as the core of its new agrarian program.[^41] Aidit advocated that land be taken from landlords and given directly to peasants "as their own private property," and the party formally adopted this principle with the slogan "land to the peasants."[^42]

When the new share-tenancy law and the 1960 Basic Agrarian Law (BAL) were promulgated, Aidit and the PKI mobilized millions of peasants to demand implementation.[^43] The law aimed to eliminate big landlords, distribute land to rural laborers, and enforce a division of the harvest between tenants and landowners.[^44] The BTI campaigned for tenant farmers to receive a fairer share of crops, demanding a 60:40 ratio in favor of tenants, or at least 50:50.[^45] Though implementation was often sabotaged by the conservative state bureaucracy, the PKI's agrarian campaign represented the most significant challenge to rural inequality in Indonesian history.[^46]

### Theoretical and Literary Contributions

Aidit was not merely an organizer but also a significant Marxist theorist and author. He wrote prolifically, producing works including "History of the Indonesian Workers' Movement," "Taking the Way of the Rakyat," "Towards a New Indonesia," "The Birth of the PKI and Its Development," and "The Peasants."[^47] In early 1948, Aidit, together with Lukman and Njoto, was assigned to translate "The Communist Manifesto" into Indonesian, making Marx and Engels' foundational text accessible to Indonesian audiences.[^48]

Through his writings and speeches, Aidit developed what scholars have termed the "Indonesianization" of Marxism-Leninism.[^49] This theoretical innovation entailed cross-class alliances, recognition of the political agency of the peasantry, willingness to cooperate with parties across the political spectrum, and most innovatively, a nonviolent agenda for achieving socialism.[^50] While drawing heavily from Maoist texts—particularly after Aidit lost faith in Soviet "revisionism" and embraced Chinese Communism in 1963—his adaptation differed in important ways from orthodox Maoism.[^51]

### International Communist Influence

Under Aidit's leadership, the PKI became a significant force in the international communist movement. The party's size, its success in electoral politics, and its unique strategy of peaceful transition to socialism made it an object of study and debate among communists worldwide. Aidit represented the PKI in international communist conferences and developed relationships with both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China during the complex period of the Sino-Soviet split.[^52] His ability to maintain relations with both communist powers while ultimately tilting toward China demonstrated sophisticated diplomatic skills.[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Role in the 30 September Movement

The most serious and enduring controversy surrounding Aidit concerns his alleged role in the 30 September Movement (Gerakan 30 September or G30S) of 1965. On the night of 30 September and the early morning of 1 October 1965, a group of military officers kidnapped and murdered six Indonesian Army generals, claiming to be preventing a coup attempt by right-wing generals against President Sukarno.[^54] The Indonesian Army, led by Major General Suharto, quickly suppressed the movement and blamed the PKI for orchestrating the violence.[^55]

Aidit gained "a negative stigma and reputation as a symbol of evil in Indonesian society, due to the perceived atrocities during and violence during the Madiun affair and the Thirtieth of September Movement committed by the Communist Party under his leadership."[^56] The 1984 propaganda film "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" (The Treachery of the September 30th Movement/PKI) further strengthened this negative image, depicting Aidit as the mastermind behind a conspiracy to overthrow the government and establish communist dictatorship.[^57]

However, "there has never been any clarity regarding the role of DN Aidit and PKI in the G30S incident."[^58] The military claimed that the PKI manipulated left-wing officers through a mysterious "special bureau" that reported only to Aidit.[^59] Recent scholarly research suggests a more complex picture: "Aidit and Sjam launched the G30S attack as a deniable pre-emptive operation to throw the army leadership off balance, with the rest of the PKI central committee in the dark."[^60] This interpretation suggests that if Aidit was involved, it was as part of a desperate, poorly-planned defensive measure rather than a calculated coup attempt, and that the millions of PKI members and supporters were "completely ignorant of the affair."[^61]

The military claimed Aidit had confessed to plotting the coup, but "officials at the U.S. embassy doubted this, as his alleged statement referenced a document they knew was disseminated as part of anti-communist propaganda operation."[^62] Aidit's son has contested the official narrative presented in films and historical accounts, pointing to historical inaccuracies and distortions.[^63]

### Consequences of the G30S and Mass Killings

Regardless of Aidit's actual role, the aftermath of the G30S was catastrophic. The failed movement provided the pretext for one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century. Most estimates place the number of people killed by Indonesian security forces and civilian militias between 500,000 and 1,000,000.[^64] "The bloody purge constitutes one of the worst, yet least known, mass murders since the Second World War."[^65] Some scholars and international bodies have characterized these killings as genocide.[^66]

Aidit himself fled Jakarta to Central Java after the events of 1 October, attempting to organize resistance.[^67] On 22 November 1965, he was captured by a search party led by Colonel Yasir Hadibroto in a house in Sambeng Village, Solo.[^68] He was brought to Boyolali in the early morning and summarily executed as part of the anti-communist purge.[^69] One account describes that "Aidit was given half an hour before being executed and made use of the time to deliver a speech. The passion with which he spoke made all who heard him very angry."[^70] The precise location of Aidit's burial remains unknown to this day.[^71]

Critics argue that Aidit bears responsibility for leading millions of Indonesians into a political movement that ended in their mass slaughter. "When the G30S happened, the defeated Indonesian left blamed D. N. Aidit for everything, though it's understandable that he had to bear the responsibility as the number-one person in the PKI."[^72]

### Criticism of Gradualist Strategy

Some revolutionary communists criticized Aidit's gradualist, parliamentary strategy as a betrayal of Marxist-Leninist principles. They argued that his willingness to collaborate with the "national bourgeoisie" represented by Sukarno and his submission to Marhaenism ideology compromised the revolutionary potential of the working class.[^73] From this perspective, Aidit's strategy of building socialism peacefully through electoral means was naïve and left the party vulnerable to destruction by reactionary forces.

The radical proposal Aidit made in early 1965 to create "the Fifth Force" made up of armed workers and peasants, and to appoint Nasakom advisers to each of the armed forces, represented a threat that may have precipitated the military's decision to move against the PKI.[^74] Critics argue this demonstrated Aidit's miscalculation of the political situation and the danger posed by the anti-communist military leadership.

### Failure to Protect Party Members

Perhaps the most devastating criticism is that Aidit failed to prepare the PKI for armed resistance despite growing tensions with the military. When the anti-communist violence began, the party's millions of members were defenseless. Aidit's leadership had built a massive political movement but had not created the capacity to defend it against military assault, leading to one of the most complete destructions of a communist party in history.[^75]

## Personal Life

### Family and Marriage

In his personal life, Dipa Nusantara Aidit married a woman named Soetanti in 1948 through an Islamic ceremony when he was 25 years old.[^76] Their relationship reportedly began as a love story before the marriage formalized their union.[^77] Together, Aidit and Soetanti had six children.[^78] Despite his communist ideology and Marxist theoretical commitments, Aidit chose to marry according to Islamic tradition, reflecting the complex religious and cultural landscape of Indonesia and his family's Islamic background through his father's founding of the Nurul Islam education organization.[^79]

Information about Aidit's day-to-day family life remains relatively scarce in historical records, partly because of the systematic suppression of positive information about PKI leaders following 1965. His last known interaction with foreign journalists occurred on 21 September 1965, just nine days before the G30S incident, when he was photographed relaxing in his house during what would be his final interview with a foreign correspondent.[^80] After the failed coup on 1 October, Aidit disappeared, reportedly fleeing to Central and East Java.[^81]

### Personality and Character

Those who knew Aidit described him as a passionate and compelling speaker who could move audiences with his oratory.[^82] Even in his final moments before execution, according to one account, he delivered a speech with such passion that it angered those who heard him rather than moving them to mercy.[^83] This suggests a man deeply committed to his ideological convictions until the very end.

Aidit's political personality combined pragmatism with revolutionary commitment. His willingness to adapt Marxist-Leninist theory to Indonesian conditions, to work within parliamentary democracy, and to collaborate with President Sukarno demonstrated considerable flexibility and political intelligence.[^84] Yet he maintained his core communist beliefs and his vision of transforming Indonesian society through socialist revolution.[^85]

The name change from Ahmad to Dipa Nusantara reflects Aidit's sense of destiny and nationalist mission. He chose "the nation's guardian" as his identity in the early 1950s "when he sensed that he would soon become an important figure."[^86] This self-awareness and ambition drove his remarkable rise from a young activist to the leader of one of the world's largest communist parties by his early thirties.

### Cultural Background and Identity

Aidit's background uniquely positioned him within Indonesian society. Born to a father who was an Islamic organization leader and a mother from noble lineage, he embodied the complexity of Indonesian identity—Islamic, aristocratic, and revolutionary.[^87] His education in Dutch colonial schools, his political awakening under Japanese occupation, and his formation alongside Indonesia's founding fathers created a multifaceted political identity that could appeal to diverse constituencies.[^88]

## Legacy

### Immediate Impact and Destruction of the PKI

Dipa Nusantara Aidit's most immediate legacy was the destruction of the political movement he built. The PKI, which under his leadership had become the largest political party in Indonesia and the third-largest communist party globally, was completely annihilated in 1965-66.[^89] The mass killings that followed the G30S affair resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands—possibly up to one million—suspected communists and their sympathizers.[^90] This represents one of the most complete destructions of a communist party in history, fundamentally reshaping Indonesian politics and society for generations.

Indonesia's subsequent New Order regime under Suharto (1966-1998) systematically suppressed any positive memory of Aidit or the PKI.[^91] The very word "communist" became taboo, and any association with left-wing politics became dangerous. As one source notes, "'No Country is More Afraid of Communism Than Indonesia.'"[^92] This anti-communist hysteria, which Aidit's actions (or perceived actions) helped trigger, defined Indonesian politics for more than three decades and continues to influence political discourse today.[^93]

### Contested Historical Memory

Aidit's legacy remains intensely contested in Indonesian society. For decades, official history portrayed him as the architect of a treasonous conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate government and establish communist totalitarianism.[^94] The government-produced film "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" was mandatory viewing for Indonesian students for years, cementing Aidit's image as a villain in the national consciousness.[^95]

However, more recent scholarship and advocacy have begun to challenge this one-dimensional portrayal. A book titled "Aidit: Dua Wajah Dipa Nusantara" (Aidit: Two Faces of Dipa Nusantara) discusses both his positive contributions and negative aspects, offering "a more complete version of DN Aidit."[^96] Some activists and scholars argue for historical reconciliation and a more nuanced understanding of the 1965 events. One article titled "No Reconciliation without Truth" argues that genuine historical reckoning requires acknowledgment of the mass killings and a more honest examination of what actually occurred.[^97]

An article from the Asia-Pacific Solidarity Network describes Aidit as "A tragically misunderstood PKI leader," suggesting that his actual role and intentions have been distorted by propaganda.[^98] His son and family members have also worked to contest historical inaccuracies and call for a more accurate historical account.[^99]

### Theoretical and Strategic Legacy

Within international communist and socialist movements, Aidit's legacy is complex. His strategy of peaceful, parliamentary transition to socialism and collaboration with non-communist forces represented an alternative model to revolutionary armed struggle.[^100] This approach influenced communist parties in other developing nations considering how to build mass movements and gain political power.

However, the catastrophic failure of this strategy—ending in the massacre of the movement's adherents—also served as a cautionary tale. Leftist critics have used the Indonesian disaster to argue that relying on bourgeois democratic institutions without developing independent armed capacity leaves working-class movements vulnerable to violent suppression.[^101] The destruction of the PKI "climaxed the Party leadership's growing impatience with gradualism and heralded the Party's demise in Indonesia."[^102]

Aidit's theoretical work on the "Indonesianization" of Marxism-Leninism, particularly his emphasis on agrarian revolution and peasant mobilization, contributed to debates about adapting communist ideology to diverse national contexts.[^103] His writings continue to be studied by scholars examining the adaptation of Maoism in Southeast Asia and the relationship between nationalist and communist movements in post-colonial societies.[^104]

### Social and Cultural Impact

Beyond purely political legacies, the PKI under Aidit's leadership created extensive social and cultural programs that had lasting impacts on Indonesian society. The literacy programs, cultural organizations like Lekra, women's organizations like Gerwani, and peasant unions left a mark on Indonesian civil society even after their violent suppression.[^105] Many Indonesians, particularly in rural areas and among the working class, remember the PKI's community programs and social services positively, despite decades of official vilification.[^106]

The agrarian reform movement that Aidit championed, though ultimately unsuccessful, raised consciousness about land inequality and tenant farmers' rights.[^107] These issues continue to resonate in contemporary Indonesian politics, even if they can no longer be openly linked to the PKI's historical advocacy.

### International Significance

The destruction of the PKI represented a major geopolitical shift in the Cold War. As one source notes, "In October, 1965, came the most disastrous blow to China in the entire Cold war era when the Indonesian army broke with President Sukarno and systematically destroyed the Chinese-oriented PKI Communist party of Indonesia."[^108] The elimination of the world's third-largest communist party and Indonesia's subsequent alignment with Western powers significantly altered the balance of power in Southeast Asia during a critical period of the Vietnam War.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and supporters who view Aidit more favorably emphasize his organizational genius and his success in building a mass political movement that championed the interests of Indonesia's peasants, workers, and poor.[^109] They point to the PKI's educational programs, which were "far more successful in educating illiterate workers and farmers than underfunded state schools or private Islamic boarding schools."[^110] From this perspective, Aidit built not merely a political party but "a social and cultural revolution" that empowered millions of marginalized Indonesians.[^111]

Contemporary academic research has increasingly recognized the sophistication of Aidit's theoretical work. The Cambridge journal Modern Intellectual History published a detailed study titled "'Heirs to What Had Been Accomplished': D. N. Aidit, the PKI, and Maoism, 1950–1965," which argues that "Maoism was influential on PKI theory and praxis" but that scholars "have underevaluated the extent to which PKI leaders, notably Aidit and Muhammad Hatta Lukman, engaged with Mao's ideas."[^112] This research demonstrates that Aidit was not merely implementing Chinese communist directives but creatively adapting Maoist concepts to Indonesian conditions.

Aidit's "Indonesianization" of Marxism-Leninism, which emphasized "cross-class alliances, the political agency of the peasantry, willingness to cooperate with parties across the political spectrum, and, most innovatively, a nonviolent agenda," represented a distinctive contribution to communist political strategy.[^113] Some scholars view this as a potentially viable path toward socialism that was tragically cut short by military violence rather than inherent flaws in the strategy itself.

Supporters also note Aidit's pragmatic political skills. "Though a Marxist, Aidit submitted to Sukarno's Marhaenism policy and allowed the party to grow without any overt intentions towards power."[^114] This tactical flexibility enabled the PKI to achieve unprecedented growth and influence. At just 31 years old, Aidit demonstrated remarkable leadership ability: "he only needed a year or two to make the PKI one of the top four political parties in Indonesia."[^115] By any measure, transforming a marginalized, persecuted organization into the largest political party in the nation represented an extraordinary political achievement.

The Asia-Pacific Solidarity Network's article "Aidit: A tragically misunderstood PKI leader" argues that Aidit has been unfairly demonized and that a more balanced assessment would recognize both his genuine commitment to improving the lives of ordinary Indonesians and the tragic circumstances that led to his death and the destruction of the movement he built.[^116]

Contemporary leftist movements in Indonesia and internationally have begun to reclaim Aidit's legacy as part of broader efforts at historical justice. They argue that "no reconciliation without truth" can be achieved regarding the 1965 massacres, and that understanding Aidit's actual role and the PKI's genuine social programs is essential for historical reckoning.[^117]

### Negative Views

Critics of Aidit, particularly from anti-communist and conservative perspectives, hold him responsible for leading millions of Indonesians into a political movement that ended catastrophically. The official Indonesian narrative for decades portrayed Aidit as "the brain of 1965 coup" and the architect of a treasonous conspiracy to overthrow the legitimate government and establish a totalitarian communist dictatorship.[^118] The 1984 film "Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI" (The Treachery of the September 30th Movement/PKI), which was mandatory viewing in Indonesian schools, depicted Aidit as manipulating naive military officers and planning the brutal murder of army generals.[^119]

From this perspective, "Aidit gained a negative stigma and reputation as a symbol of evil in Indonesian society, due to the perceived atrocities during and violence during the Madiun affair and the Thirtieth of September Movement committed by the Communist Party under his leadership."[^120] These critics argue that Aidit's ambitions to transform Indonesia into a communist state led directly to the violence of 1965 and the subsequent mass killings.

Some analysts emphasize Aidit's strategic miscalculations. His proposal in early 1965 to create "the Fifth Force" made up of armed workers and peasants and to appoint Nasakom advisers to the armed forces "was a direct threat to the armed services" that may have precipitated the military's decision to move against the PKI.[^121] Critics argue that this demonstrated political recklessness and a fundamental misunderstanding of the military's power and determination to prevent communist influence in the armed forces.

Even some on the left have criticized Aidit's leadership. "When the G30S happened, the defeated Indonesian left blamed D. N. Aidit for everything."[^122] These critics argue that Aidit's gradualist strategy and reliance on collaboration with Sukarno left the PKI vulnerable to military assault without the capacity for armed resistance. The strategy of peaceful parliamentary transition, they contend, was naïve given the realities of class struggle and the anti-communist commitment of the military leadership.

The mystery surrounding Aidit's actual involvement in the G30S continues to fuel negative assessments. While some scholars suggest his role may have been limited or defensive in nature, "there has never been any clarity regarding the role of DN Aidit and PKI in the G30S incident."[^123] The lack of definitive evidence either exonerating or condemning Aidit allows multiple interpretations, with critics tending to accept the military's narrative of PKI responsibility.

The sheer scale of the catastrophe—with estimates ranging from 500,000 to one million deaths—inevitably colors assessments of Aidit's leadership.[^124] Critics argue that as the paramount leader of the PKI, Aidit bears ultimate responsibility for the movement's destruction and the massacre of its members, regardless of his specific actions regarding the G30S. From this view, his leadership led millions of Indonesians into a movement that ended in one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century.

The long-term damage to Indonesian democracy and civil society also factors into negative assessments. The destruction of the PKI and the subsequent New Order dictatorship under Suharto (1966-1998) eliminated genuine political pluralism and created a repressive authoritarian regime.[^125] While anti-communist critics may view this as justified, the broader cost to Indonesian political development represents a tragic legacy with which Aidit's name will forever be associated.
