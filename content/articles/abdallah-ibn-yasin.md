## Summary

Abdallah ibn Yasin was a Maliki scholar and ascetic who founded the Almoravid movement in the western Sahara. He established a ribat (fortified monastery) where he trained warriors in both Islamic learning and military discipline. His movement united the Sanhaja Berber tribes and launched a jihad that eventually created the Almoravid Empire, spanning from Senegal to Spain. He combined strict religious reform with military conquest.
