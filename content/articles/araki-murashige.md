## Summary

Araki Murashige (荒木 村重, 1535 – June 20, 1586) was a prominent Japanese daimyo and samurai of the Sengoku period who served under Oda Nobunaga before launching a dramatic rebellion in 1578. Initially rising to prominence through military exploits and becoming lord of Settsu Province, Murashige's betrayal shocked Nobunaga and triggered one of the most brutal reprisals of the era, resulting in the execution of 670 hostages including his own family. After escaping the siege of Itami Castle in 1579, he reinvented himself as a devoted tea master under Sen no Rikyū, becoming one of the legendary Rikyū Shichi-tetsu (Seven Disciples of Rikyū) and taking the tea name Dōkun. His transformation from feared warlord to refined aesthete represents one of the most remarkable redemption arcs in Japanese history.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Araki Murashige was born in 1535 in Ikeda, located in present-day Ikeda City, Osaka Prefecture, in the heart of Settsu Province. He was the eldest son of Araki Yoshimura (also recorded as Araki Takamura in some sources), who served as a retainer of the powerful Ikeda clan and held the position of lord of Ikeda Castle. Araki Yoshimura was counted among the six leading retainers of Ikeda Katsumasa, head of the influential Settsu-Ikeda clan that controlled much of the strategically vital Settsu Province.[^4][^5][^6]

The Araki family claimed descent from distinguished lineage, tracing their ancestry to relatives of the Hatano clan, who in turn were descendants of the legendary warrior Fujiwara no Hidesato. This connection to ancient samurai nobility provided the Araki family with both prestige and a proud martial tradition that young Murashige would inherit and embody throughout his military career.[^7][^8]

Growing up in the tumultuous Sengoku period, Murashige was immersed in a world of constant warfare, shifting alliances, and the violent struggle for power that defined 16th-century Japan. Settsu Province, where he spent his formative years, occupied a strategic position between Kyoto and the western provinces, making it a crucial battleground for competing warlords seeking control over the imperial capital and access to trade routes. Under the tutelage of his father and the patronage of the Ikeda clan, Murashige received training in both martial arts and the administrative skills necessary for leadership in the warrior class.[^9][^10]

To cement his position within the Ikeda clan hierarchy, Murashige married the daughter of Ikeda Nagamasa, thereby becoming not merely a retainer but a blood relative of the ruling family. This advantageous marriage alliance significantly elevated his status and bound him more closely to the fortunes of his lords. When Ikeda Katsumasa aligned himself with the rising power of Oda Nobunaga following Nobunaga's successful campaign to establish authority in Kyoto in the late 1560s and early 1570s, Murashige followed his lord's lead and entered service under the ambitious unifier.[^11][^12]

The young Murashige quickly distinguished himself through his military capabilities, administrative competence, and personal charisma. By the time he entered Nobunaga's service, he had already gained a reputation as a formidable warrior and capable commander, qualities that would soon propel him to positions of significant authority within the Oda military hierarchy.[^13][^14]

## Rise to Power

Araki Murashige's ascent within Oda Nobunaga's expanding domain was meteoric, demonstrating both his martial prowess and political acumen. In 1573, recognizing Murashige's talents and rewarding his loyalty, Nobunaga appointed him daimyo of Ibaraki Castle, granting him direct control over territory and subjects—a significant promotion that marked his transition from retainer to independent feudal lord. The same year, Murashige played a major role in the assault on Makishimajo Castle at Uji, when Nobunaga moved against Ashikaga Yoshiaki, the rebellious shogun who had turned against his former patron.[^15][^16][^17]

The year 1574 proved even more pivotal for Murashige's career. Operating alongside Hashiba Hideyoshi (later known as Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who would eventually unify Japan), Murashige participated in the siege of Arioka Castle, also known as Itami Castle, then held by Itami Chikaoki. The castle occupied a strategic location in Settsu Province, and its capture was essential for Nobunaga's control over the region. Nobunaga's forces employed sophisticated siege tactics, including tunneling operations to undermine the castle's walls. When the fortress finally fell, Nobunaga demonstrated his high regard for Murashige by granting him lordship over the newly captured stronghold.[^18][^19][^20]

This appointment represented an extraordinary advancement in status and responsibility. By 1574, Murashige had been granted control over the entire province of Settsu, one of the most economically and strategically vital regions in all of Japan. Settsu Province included major commercial centers, controlled access to Kyoto, and served as a crucial junction for armies moving between the capital region and the western provinces. The appointment made Murashige one of Nobunaga's most important regional commanders, responsible for securing the rear areas while other generals conducted campaigns in more distant theaters.[^21][^22][^23]

Murashige continued to serve Nobunaga with apparent loyalty and distinction. In 1576, he was assigned to command a portion of Nobunaga's forces during the prolonged siege of Ishiyama Honganji, the heavily fortified temple-fortress that served as the headquarters of the militant Ikkō-ikki Buddhist leagues. This decade-long siege represented one of Nobunaga's most challenging military endeavors, as the temple complex was defended by fanatical warrior monks and supported by powerful allies including the Mōri clan. Murashige's participation in this critical campaign demonstrated Nobunaga's continued confidence in his abilities and loyalty.[^24][^25][^26]

Throughout this period, Nobunaga treated Murashige with notable preferential treatment, elevating him above many other retainers and entrusting him with positions of great responsibility. Contemporary sources indicate that Nobunaga held Murashige in exceptionally high regard, making the subsequent rebellion all the more shocking to the warlord who prided himself on his judgment of character and ability to inspire loyalty through a combination of rewards and intimidation.[^27][^28]

## Major Achievements

Before his infamous rebellion, Araki Murashige compiled an impressive record of military service and administrative accomplishments that established him as one of Oda Nobunaga's most capable commanders. His strategic acumen was demonstrated through successful military operations across multiple theaters of war during the critical years of Nobunaga's expansion.[^29][^30]

His capture and subsequent governance of Itami Castle (Arioka Castle) in 1574 stands as perhaps his most significant military achievement. The fortress, strategically positioned in Settsu Province, required sophisticated siege tactics to overcome. Working in coordination with Hashiba Hideyoshi, Murashige helped implement Nobunaga's strategy of undermining the castle walls through tunneling operations, demonstrating technical military knowledge beyond simple battlefield tactics. The successful capture of this stronghold opened Settsu Province to Oda control and eliminated a potential rallying point for anti-Oda forces in the region.[^31][^32]

As lord of Settsu Province from 1574 to 1578, Murashige demonstrated considerable administrative competence. Settsu Province was economically vital, containing prosperous commercial towns and serving as a major hub for trade between the capital region and western Japan. Managing such a complex territory required not only military strength but also diplomatic skill, economic understanding, and the ability to balance competing interests among merchants, temples, and local power holders. Contemporary records indicate that Murashige successfully maintained order and extracted revenues necessary to support both his own forces and contribute to Nobunaga's larger military operations.[^33][^34]

Murashige's continuous service during the siege of Ishiyama Honganji from 1576 to 1578 involved commanding forces in one of the most challenging military operations of the Sengoku period. The Ishiyama Honganji fortress-temple was defended by religiously motivated warrior monks willing to fight to the death, supported by the powerful Mōri clan's naval forces that could supply the fortress from the sea. Murashige's ability to maintain effective siege operations while simultaneously governing Settsu Province demonstrated exceptional organizational capabilities and stamina.[^35][^36]

Beyond military accomplishments, Murashige cultivated sophisticated cultural interests that distinguished him within the warrior class. Even before his later fame as a tea master, he demonstrated appreciation for poetry, aesthetics, and refined cultural pursuits. He collected valuable tea implements and patronized cultural activities, embodying the ideal of the cultured warrior that characterized the most successful daimyo of the period. This cultural sophistication would later enable his remarkable transformation into one of Sen no Rikyū's most accomplished disciples.[^37][^38]

His personal martial prowess contributed to his reputation and effectiveness as a commander. Legend records that Murashige carried an iron war fan (tessen) and possessed the quick thinking and combat skills necessary to use such an unconventional weapon effectively. Whether or not the famous legend of him using the tessen to foil an assassination attempt is historically accurate, it reflects contemporary perceptions of him as both dangerous and clever—a man not easily defeated through conventional means.[^39][^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Araki Murashige's rebellion against Oda Nobunaga in 1578 stands as one of the most controversial betrayals of the Sengoku period, generating debates about his motivations and moral culpability that continue among historians to this day. In October 1578, during the ongoing siege of Miki Castle, Murashige abruptly abandoned his position at the front lines, returned to his stronghold at Arioka Castle, and declared his defection from the Oda cause. The rebellion shocked Nobunaga, who had shown Murashige exceptional favor and had elevated him to control over an entire province.[^41][^42][^43]

Multiple theories have been advanced to explain Murashige's drastic decision. The most commonly cited explanation involves accusations by Akechi Mitsuhide that Murashige harbored sympathies toward the Mōri clan, one of Nobunaga's principal enemies. Some sources suggest that Murashige's vassal, Nakagawa Kiyohide, had secretly been selling military provisions to the besieged Ishiyama Honganji temple, and that Murashige feared Nobunaga's terrible wrath if this betrayal was discovered. Other interpretations propose that Murashige responded to requests from the deposed Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki and the Ishiyama Honganji leadership, both of whom sought to create a coalition against Nobunaga. A more strategic analysis suggests that Murashige calculated that his rebellion would isolate both Toyotomi Hideyoshi's army advancing in Harima Province and Akechi Mitsuhide's forces campaigning in Tanba Province, potentially collapsing Nobunaga's western operations.[^44][^45][^46][^47]

Regardless of his motivations, the manner of Murashige's rebellion compounded the offense in the eyes of contemporaries. When Kuroda Yoshitaka (Kuroda Kanbei), one of Nobunaga's most trusted strategists, traveled to Arioka Castle to negotiate and convince Murashige to reconsider his rebellion, Murashige imprisoned rather than negotiated with him. This act of treachery against an envoy operating under diplomatic immunity violated accepted norms of conduct, even in the lawless Sengoku era. Nobunaga, not receiving word from Kuroda and suspecting that the strategist had also defected, nearly executed Kuroda's son who had been left as a hostage—an innocent boy who would have died because of Murashige's duplicity.[^48][^49][^50]

The most damning criticism of Murashige concerns his ultimate abandonment of his family, retainers, and the people who had trusted him. In August 1579, as the year-long siege of Arioka Castle reached its inevitable conclusion, with his two most important subordinates—Nakagawa Kiyohide and the Christian daimyo Takayama Ukon—having betrayed him and surrendered to Nobunaga, Murashige made the decision to save himself. Rather than dying honorably with his garrison or negotiating terms that might spare the innocent, he slipped through Nobunaga's siege lines under cover of darkness and fled to Amagasaki Castle, leaving behind everyone who had supported his rebellion.[^51][^52][^53]

The consequences for those he abandoned were catastrophic. When Nobunaga's forces finally took complete control of Arioka Castle in October 1579, the warlord unleashed one of the most brutal reprisals recorded in Sengoku history. On December 13, 1579, 122 women and children—the families of Murashige's retainers—were dressed in clean clothes, erected on 97 crosses, and executed by arquebus fire at Nanatsumatsu near Amagasaki. The contemporary chronicle Shinchōkō-ki records that "everyone who watched fell prostrate and could not control the emotions, as the pitiful cries of 122 court ladies echoed into the heavens." Following this mass execution, 124 men and 388 women were locked into four farmhouses that were then set ablaze, burning them alive. On December 16, an additional 36 members of Murashige's own family and senior retainers were paraded through Kyoto in humiliation before being beheaded at Rokujōgawara. In total, approximately 670 people lost their lives as punishment for Murashige's rebellion.[^54][^55][^56][^57]

Among the executed was Murashige's concubine Lady Dashi, renowned as a great beauty and called the "Concubine Yang of the Current Age." Sources record that she was either 21 or 24 years old at her execution. According to accounts, she maintained remarkable composure during her final moments, reciting a poem while being transported to the execution ground, then carefully arranging her appearance—tightening her sash, straightening her hair, loosening her collar—before calmly presenting her neck for the executioner's blade. Her dignity in death stood in stark contrast to Murashige's ignoble flight.[^58][^59][^60]

Murashige's actions earned him condemnation from contemporaries and subsequent generations. Even after his transformation into a tea master, vestiges of his disgrace remained. When he first returned to cultural circles following Nobunaga's death in 1582, he initially referred to himself as "feces" (kuso) in self-deprecation for having abandoned his family. Later accounts record an encounter between Murashige and Takayama Ukon at a gathering hosted by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Face to face with the man whose betrayal had ensured the failure of his rebellion and the slaughter of his family, Murashige merely commented that Ukon's "insides and outsides are different"—a mild rebuke that was nevertheless interpreted as an implicit criticism of Hideyoshi (who favored Ukon), causing Murashige to fall from favor at court.[^61][^62][^63]

The rebellion and its aftermath raise profound moral questions about duty, loyalty, self-preservation, and the terrible costs of political decisions in an age of total war. While some historians attempt to understand Murashige's rebellion through strategic or political lenses, the fact remains that his choices led directly to the deaths of hundreds of innocent people who had placed their trust in his leadership.[^64][^65]

## Personal Life

Araki Murashige's personal life reflected the complex web of political alliances and family relationships that characterized the Sengoku period's warrior class. He entered into multiple marriages during his lifetime, each serving both personal and political purposes. His principal wife was the daughter of Ikeda Nagamasa, a union that strengthened his ties to the powerful Ikeda clan and elevated his position within the Settsu Province power structure. He also married the daughter of Kitakawara Mikawa-no-kami and the daughter of the Kawanabe clan, the latter of whom became known as Lady Dashi.[^66][^67]

Lady Dashi, whether a secondary wife or concubine depending on varying source interpretations, became particularly notable in historical records. Celebrated for her extraordinary beauty, she was eulogized by contemporaries as the "Concubine Yang of the Current Age," comparing her to Yang Guifei, the legendary beauty of Tang Dynasty China whose allure reportedly contributed to an empire's downfall. Despite her connection to Murashige, she remained at Arioka Castle when he fled in 1579, becoming one of the hundreds of victims of Nobunaga's wrath. Her reported composure and dignity during her execution at age 21 or 24—carefully composing a farewell poem and arranging her appearance before calmly accepting death—created a poignant counterpoint to Murashige's survival through abandonment.[^68][^69][^70]

Murashige fathered several children, the most historically significant being the son who would become Iwasa Matabei (1578-1650). Following the catastrophic fall of Arioka Castle and the execution of so many family members, this child was rescued by his foster mother and raised under his mother's family name "Iwasa" rather than the dishonored name "Araki." Growing up in Kyoto separated from his biological father, the young Matabei would eventually become one of Japan's most celebrated artists of the early Edo period, renowned for his paintings and founding a distinctive artistic style. The fact that Iwasa Matabei achieved such cultural prominence despite—or perhaps partly because of—his tragic family history represents a form of redemption for the Araki lineage.[^71][^72][^73]

Murashige also had a son named Araki Muratsugu who accompanied him to Hanakuma Castle during the rebellion. The fate of this son remains somewhat unclear in historical records, though he presumably either perished during the conflict or survived in obscurity, unable to use the stigmatized Araki name openly.[^74][^75]

Beyond family relationships, Murashige's personality emerges from historical sources as complex and multifaceted. Before his rebellion, he was known as a capable administrator, suggesting patience and attention to detail. His military record indicates decisiveness and courage in combat situations. His later mastery of tea ceremony reveals aesthetic sensitivity and the capacity for profound discipline and refinement. Contemporary accounts suggest he possessed considerable personal charisma, necessary for maintaining the loyalty of retainers and inspiring troops in battle.[^76][^77]

His later years as the tea master Dōkun demonstrate remarkable psychological adaptability and capacity for self-reinvention. The transformation from feared warrior commanding armies to humble student of aesthetic refinement required not merely a change in occupation but a fundamental reorientation of identity and values. His deep engagement with tea ceremony philosophy, his reported love for poetry and classical Japanese literature, and his collection of beautiful tea implements all suggest a man with genuine appreciation for refined culture, not merely someone adopting tea practice as convenient camouflage.[^78][^79]

The relationship between Murashige and Sen no Rikyū appears to have been one of genuine master-disciple devotion. Rikyū entrusted Murashige with some of his most detailed and intimate teachings on tea practice, preserved in the manuscript "Araki Settsu Kami-ate Densho." This level of sharing suggests Rikyū saw past Murashige's disgrace to recognize authentic potential for spiritual and aesthetic development. The depth of Murashige's commitment to tea practice is evidenced by his inclusion among the Rikyū Shichi-tetsu (Seven Disciples), a posthumous honor extended only to Rikyū's most accomplished and devoted students.[^80][^81][^82]

## Legacy

Araki Murashige's legacy presents one of the most paradoxical and complex reputations in Japanese history—simultaneously remembered as an infamous traitor whose rebellion triggered one of the Sengoku period's worst atrocities and as one of the most accomplished tea masters in Japanese cultural history. This dual legacy continues to fascinate historians, artists, and cultural commentators, making Murashige a subject of ongoing scholarly study and popular cultural representation.[^83][^84][^85]

In military and political history, Murashige's rebellion serves as a cautionary tale about the fragility of loyalty during the Sengoku period and the catastrophic consequences of miscalculation in an age of total war. His decision to rebel against Oda Nobunaga has been analyzed by military historians as a case study in failed strategy—the expected reinforcements from the Mōri clan and Ishiyama Honganji never materialized, his subordinates proved unreliable, and his year-long siege achieved nothing except ensuring his own forces' eventual destruction. The brutal executions that followed his rebellion demonstrated the terrible price of failure and reinforced Nobunaga's reputation for ruthlessness, potentially deterring other potential rebels through sheer horror.[^86][^87][^88]

However, Murashige's transformation into the tea master Dōkun represents an equally significant legacy in Japanese cultural history. After escaping from Itami and living through Nobunaga's assassination at Honnōji in 1582, Murashige returned first to Sakai and then to Osaka, where he devoted himself entirely to chanoyu (tea ceremony) under the tutelage of Sen no Rikyū, the greatest tea master of the age. Rikyū's decision to accept Murashige as a disciple despite his notorious past suggests that the tea master recognized genuine potential for transformation and spiritual development.[^89][^90][^91]

The teachings Rikyū shared with Murashige, particularly those preserved in the "Araki Settsu Kami-ate Densho" manuscript, are considered among the most detailed and intimate transmissions of tea ceremony philosophy from the master's hand. These teachings cover not merely technical aspects of tea preparation but deeper principles of aesthetics, spirituality, and the pursuit of wabi-sabi—finding beauty in simplicity, imperfection, and transience. Murashige's inclusion in the Rikyū Shichi-tetsu (Seven Disciples of Rikyū) in the "Teaist Genealogy of All Generations Past and Present" establishes his position among the most important transmitters of Rikyū's teachings to subsequent generations.[^92][^93][^94]

The name "Dōkun" (道薫, meaning "Scent of the Tao") that Murashige adopted as his tea name carries symbolic weight. According to some accounts, Toyotomi Hideyoshi granted him permission to use this name after Murashige had initially adopted the self-deprecating name referring to excrement, acknowledging his shame at having abandoned his family. The transition from self-loathing to a name suggesting spiritual fragrance represents a narrative of redemption through aesthetic and spiritual practice.[^95][^96]

Murashige's influence on subsequent tea culture extends beyond his own practice. His son Iwasa Matabei, though raised apart from his father and using his mother's name, became one of the most important artists of the early Edo period. Iwasa Matabei's paintings, which often depicted historical and cultural themes with distinctive stylistic innovations, can be understood partly as aesthetic responses to his family's traumatic history—transforming tragedy into art, much as his father transformed military defeat into cultural achievement.[^97][^98]

In popular culture, Murashige has appeared in various forms of media. Notably, Honobu Yonezawa, winner of the prestigious Naoki Prize, wrote a novel titled "Kokurōjō" (The Samurai and the Prisoner/Black Prison Castle) that focuses on Murashige during the siege of Itami Castle. The novel explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, honor, and survival through Murashige's perspective, presenting a more nuanced view of his character and decisions than simple condemnation would allow. Such cultural productions demonstrate continuing fascination with Murashige's contradictions and transformations.[^99][^100]

Video games, particularly those in the historical simulation and strategy genres such as Koei's "Nobunaga's Ambition" and "Samurai Warriors" series, regularly feature Murashige as a character, typically portrayed as a capable commander whose loyalty rating can shift, reflecting his historical betrayal. These representations introduce Murashige to international audiences and keep his story alive in popular memory.[^101][^102]

The semi-legendary tale of Murashige using an iron war fan (tessen) to foil Nobunaga's alleged assassination attempt—by placing the fan in the sliding door groove to prevent the door from being slammed on his neck—has become one of the most repeated anecdotes about his cleverness and warrior skills. Whether or not this incident actually occurred, it has achieved the status of historical legend, representing broader themes about intelligence, preparedness, and survival.[^103][^104]

Murashige died on June 20, 1586, at age 52 in Sakai. After 1586, his name no longer appears on any tea ceremony attendance lists, and his name appears on a gravestone marker bearing that date in Itami. The circumstances surrounding his death remain somewhat obscure, though some sources suggest he fell from favor at Hideyoshi's court after his mild criticism of Takayama Ukon was interpreted as implicit criticism of Hideyoshi himself. His death ended a life that had traversed the full spectrum from martial glory to crushing defeat to cultural accomplishment.[^105][^106][^107]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and cultural historians who view Araki Murashige positively tend to emphasize his remarkable capacity for transformation and his significant contributions to Japanese tea culture. In the realm of chanoyu, Murashige's legacy is almost entirely positive—he is remembered as one of Sen no Rikyū's most devoted and accomplished disciples, a practitioner who achieved mastery sufficient to be counted among the Rikyū Shichi-tetsu. Tea ceremony historians note that the teachings Rikyū shared with Murashige, particularly those preserved in the "Araki Settsu Kami-ate Densho" manuscript, represent some of the most detailed and philosophically profound transmissions from the great master.[^108][^109]

From this perspective, Murashige's life represents a powerful narrative of redemption through aesthetic and spiritual practice. Having committed terrible errors that led to catastrophic consequences, he spent his final years pursuing a path of refinement and self-cultivation that allowed him to contribute something of lasting value to Japanese culture. Tea historians argue that his past made his devotion to tea more profound—he practiced not as a hobby of the warrior class but as a man seeking atonement and transformation through beauty, discipline, and mindfulness.[^110][^111]

Some military historians, while not excusing his rebellion or its consequences, attempt to understand Murashige's decision-making within the strategic context of 1578. They note that his rebellion occurred at a moment when Oda Nobunaga faced multiple serious threats—the Mōri clan remained powerful in the west, the Ishiyama Honganji continued its resistance, and anti-Oda forces seemed positioned for potential coordinated action. From this analytical perspective, Murashige's rebellion could be interpreted as a calculated risk based on strategic assessment rather than simple betrayal. The fact that Nobunaga apparently made unusual efforts to convince Murashige to reconsider suggests the warlord recognized legitimate grievances or concerns might underlie the rebellion.[^112][^113]

Defenders also point to the remarkable military capabilities Murashige demonstrated before his rebellion. His successful governance of Settsu Province, his role in capturing Itami Castle, and his effective service during the Ishiyama Honganji siege all demonstrate genuine competence and loyalty during most of his career. These accomplishments, they argue, should not be entirely erased from historical memory by his final years of military activity.[^114][^115]

Cultural historians emphasize Murashige's sophisticated aesthetic sensibilities, which manifested both before and after his military career. His collection of tea implements, his reported love for poetry and classical literature, and his ability to engage with the deepest philosophical aspects of tea practice all suggest a man of genuine cultural refinement. In this view, his later cultural achievements were not merely opportunistic cover but represented authentic aspects of his character that found fuller expression after military life ended.[^116][^117]

Some scholars argue that the inclusion of Iwasa Matabei's story alongside Murashige's narrative creates a redemptive arc—the father's disgrace transformed into the son's artistic triumph, suggesting that creativity and cultural contribution can emerge even from tragedy and failure. This perspective views the Araki family legacy holistically rather than focusing solely on Murashige's worst actions.[^118][^119]

### Negative Views

Critical historians and ethicists who emphasize Murashige's negative legacy focus primarily on his betrayal of Oda Nobunaga and, more significantly, his abandonment of the people who trusted him, which led directly to one of the Sengoku period's worst atrocities. These scholars argue that regardless of whatever strategic calculations might have motivated his rebellion, the consequences—670 people executed, many of them women and children who had no role in his decisions—represent a moral catastrophe for which he bears direct responsibility.[^120][^121]

The most damning criticism concerns Murashige's flight from Arioka Castle in August 1579, leaving behind his family, retainers, and their families to face Nobunaga's wrath alone. Critics point out that traditional samurai ethics, even in the brutal Sengoku period, placed enormous emphasis on sharing the fate of one's followers. A leader who abandons those who trusted him violates fundamental principles of warrior honor. The fact that Murashige saved himself while hundreds of innocent people suffered execution is viewed as the ultimate betrayal—not of Nobunaga, but of his own people.[^122][^123]

Contemporary accounts record that even other figures of the era, themselves hardly paragons of morality in modern terms, viewed Murashige's actions with disapproval. Luis Flores, a Portuguese Jesuit historian writing during the period, documented criticisms of Murashige by other daimyo and noted that his reputation remained tarnished even after he became a respected tea master. The fact that Murashige initially called himself "feces" suggests his own awareness of the depth of his disgrace.[^124][^125]

Historians critical of Murashige also question the sincerity of his transformation into a tea master, suggesting it may have been partly opportunistic—a convenient way to survive and perhaps rehabilitate his reputation in an era when cultural accomplishment could provide social position for those excluded from military or political power. They note that while he may have achieved genuine mastery of tea practice, this does not erase or adequately atone for the deaths he caused.[^126][^127]

Military historians critical of Murashige emphasize the incompetence of his rebellion—the failure to secure reliable commitments from potential allies before defecting, the inability to maintain loyalty among his own subordinates (Nakagawa Kiyohide and Takayama Ukon both betrayed him), and the apparent lack of any realistic endgame strategy. From this perspective, he combined moral failure with strategic incompetence, betraying his lord not for a well-conceived plan with reasonable chances of success, but for a poorly-thought-out gambit that was doomed from the start.[^128][^129]

Critics also note that Murashige's imprisonment of Kuroda Yoshitaka, who came as an envoy to negotiate, violated accepted norms of diplomatic conduct and nearly resulted in the execution of an innocent child (Kuroda's son, held hostage by Nobunaga). This action demonstrates dishonorable conduct that cannot be explained away by strategic considerations.[^130][^131]

Some scholars argue that Murashige's later cultural accomplishments, while historically significant, should not be allowed to overshadow or excuse his earlier actions. They contend that historical accounts that emphasize his redemption through tea practice inadvertently minimize the suffering of his victims and the moral enormity of his choices. In this view, Murashige should primarily be remembered as a cautionary figure whose actions had devastating consequences for hundreds of innocent people.[^132][^133]

> "The Concubine Yang of the Current Age" — Contemporary description of Lady Dashi's beauty, comparing Murashige's concubine to Yang Guifei, the legendary beauty of Tang Dynasty China.[^136]

While specific tea poetry or philosophical sayings directly attributable to Murashige have not been extensively preserved in commonly available English-language sources, his teachings are preserved in the "Araki Settsu Kami-ate Densho" manuscript, which contains detailed transmissions of Sen no Rikyū's tea ceremony philosophy and practice instructions.[^137]
