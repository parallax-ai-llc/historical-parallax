## Summary

Mary Leakey made some of the most important discoveries in human evolution, including the Zinjanthropus skull at Olduvai Gorge and the Laetoli footprints — 3.6 million-year-old hominin footprints preserved in volcanic ash. Her meticulous archaeological work was often more significant than that credited to her husband Louis Leakey.
