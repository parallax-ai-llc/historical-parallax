## Summary

The **Armenian Genocide** was the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman government between 1915 and 1917. Organized by the "Three Pashas" (the ruling triumvirate), the genocide began with the execution of Armenian intellectuals and evolved into mass death marches to the Syrian Desert. It is considered the first modern genocide and served as a grim precursor to the Holocaust.

## The Process of Extermination

### Red Sunday (April 24, 1915)
The genocide is conventionally dated to start on **April 24, 1915**, when Ottoman authorities arrested and executed some 250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople (Istanbul). This decapitated the community's leadership.

### The Tehcir Law
In May 1915, Interior Minister **Talaat Pasha** passed the "Tehcir Law" (Deportation Law), which gave legal cover to the removal of the Armenian population.
*   **Disarmament:** Armenian soldiers serving in the Ottoman army were disarmed, placed in labor battalions, and then systematically murdered.

### Death Marches
The civilian population—women, children, and the elderly—were forced on death marches toward the Syrian Desert (Deir ez-Zor).
*   **Conditions:** They were denied food and water.
*   **Special Organization:** A paramilitary unit (*Teşkilât-ı Mahsusa*) created by the government tracked the caravans, raping women, kidnapping children, and massacring stragglers. The roads were lined with corpses.
*   **Caves:** In the desert, thousands were herded into caves and suffocated with smoke or fire.

## The Architect: Talaat Pasha

**Mehmed Talaat Pasha** was the primary architect.
*   **The Intent:** His telegrams reveal clear intent. He reportedly told associates: *"I have accomplished more toward solving the Armenian problem in three months than Abdul Hamid II accomplished in thirty years."*
*   **Assassination:** After fleeing to Germany post-war, Talaat was assassinated in Berlin in 1921 by **Soghomon Tehlirian**, an Armenian survivor, as part of Operation Nemesis. The German court acquitted Tehlirian after hearing testimony about the genocide.

## Denial and Legacy

### Ongoing Denial
Successive Turkish governments have consistently denied the genocide, arguing that the deaths were a result of civil war, disease, and "inter-communal violence" rather than a systematic state plan.
*   **Article 301:** In Turkey, "insulting Turkishness" (often applied to mentioning the genocide) is a crime.
*   **Recognition:** Despite this, over 30 countries have officially recognized the event as genocide, including the United States (in 2019/2021), France, and Germany.

### Hitler's Quote
The lack of punishment for the Ottoman leaders emboldened future dictators. Before invading Poland in 1939, Adolf Hitler famously asked his generals:
> *"Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"*
