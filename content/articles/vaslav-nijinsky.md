## Summary

Vaslav Nijinsky was a Russian-Polish ballet dancer and choreographer who is regarded as the greatest male dancer of the 20th century. His extraordinary leaps defied gravity, and his choreography for The Rite of Spring caused a riot at its 1913 premiere. His career was cut tragically short by mental illness at age 29.
