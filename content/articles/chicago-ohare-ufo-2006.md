## Summary

The Chicago O'Hare UFO sighting is a rare modern case occurring at one of the world's busiest airports in broad daylight. On November 7, 2006, a dark grey, metallic saucer was seen hovering over Gate C17 by at least **12 United Airlines employees**, including pilots, managers, and mechanics.

The object hovered silently for several minutes before shooting straight up into the overcast sky at incredible speed, punching a crisp, circular **hole** through the clouds that remained visible for minutes afterwards. Despite the credible witnesses and potential flight safety risk, both United Airlines and the FAA initially denied having any information until forced to acknowledge the internal reports.[^1]

## The Sighting

### The Witnesses (4:15 PM)

A ramp employee pushing back Flight 446 noticed a grey, metallic disc hovering just below the cloud deck (approx. 1,900 feet).

- **Pilots:** The pilots of Flight 446 reportedly opened their cockpit windows to get a better look.
- **Management:** A United supervisor ran out to behold the object and immediately radioed the FAA tower.
  > "I'm looking at it right now... It's just hovering there."

### The "Hole-Punch"

After about 5-15 minutes, the object accelerated vertically.

- **The Physics:** It didn't fly; it shot upward instantly.
- **The Trace:** It left a perfect, cookie-cutter hole in the cloud layer. Physics suggests this could be caused by localized evaporation from intense heat or pressure (similar to a "fallstreak hole" but instigated by an object).[^2]

### The Cover-Up?

- **FAA Stance:** The FAA claimed it was a "weather phenomenon" (hole-punch cloud) and refused to investigate because the object didn't appear on radar.
- **Narayana Report:** Later analysis by NARCAP (National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena) pointed out that improved digital radar filters often scrub out stationary objects (hovering UFOs) as "clutter."
- **Silence:** United Airlines employees were allegedly advised not to speak to the press.[^3]
