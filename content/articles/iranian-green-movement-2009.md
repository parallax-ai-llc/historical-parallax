## Summary

The Iranian Green Movement (Jonbesh-e Sabz-e Irān) was a pro-democracy protest movement that erupted following the disputed June 12, 2009 presidential election, in which incumbent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner over reformist challenger Mir-Hossein Mousavi despite widespread allegations of fraud. Taking its name and symbol from Mousavi's campaign color, the movement represented the largest popular challenge to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 Revolution.[^1]

On June 15, 2009, up to three million people marched through Tehran demanding to know "Where is my vote?" (Rāy-e man kojāst?)—making it the largest protest in Iran's history. The green-clad crowds shocked the regime and captured global attention. On June 20, the shooting death of 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan, captured on video and broadcast worldwide, transformed her into an international symbol of the movement and Iranian state brutality.[^2]

The regime responded with systematic repression: Revolutionary Guards and Basij paramilitaries attacked protesters; thousands were arrested; torture and deaths occurred in detention; leaders were placed under house arrest. By early 2010, the visible movement had been crushed. Yet its legacy—exposing deep divisions within the Islamic Republic and inspiring subsequent protests—endures. Mousavi and fellow reformist Mehdi Karroubi remain under house arrest more than 14 years later, their fate a testament to the movement's unfinished business.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Islamic Republic

Iran has been governed by an Islamic theocracy since the 1979 Revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Power is divided between:

- **Supreme Leader:** Ultimate authority (Ayatollah Khomeini 1979-1989; Ayatollah Khamenei since 1989)
- **President:** Elected every four years but subordinate to Supreme Leader
- **Guardian Council:** Vets all candidates; can block legislation
- **Revolutionary Guards (IRGC):** Parallel military force; major economic power
- **Basij:** Paramilitary volunteer force under IRGC command[^4]

### Reform vs. Hardline

Since the 1990s, Iranian politics has oscillated between:

- **Reformists:** Seeking gradual liberalization within the system
- **Hardliners/Principlists:** Emphasizing revolutionary values, hostility to West

President Mohammad Khatami (1997-2005) represented reform hopes that ultimately disappointed. Ahmadinejad (2005-2013) represented hardline populism backed by the Supreme Leader and IRGC.[^5]

### The 2009 Election Context

By 2009, many Iranians were frustrated with Ahmadinejad's confrontational foreign policy, economic mismanagement, and social restrictions. Reformist candidates Mir-Hossein Mousavi (former prime minister) and Mehdi Karroubi attracted massive enthusiasm, especially among educated youth and urbanites. Campaign rallies became celebratory expressions of hope for change.[^6]

## The Election and Its Aftermath

### June 12, 2009: Election Day

Approximately 85% of eligible voters participated. Exit polls and expectations suggested a close race or Mousavi victory.

### June 13: The Fraud Claim

Just two hours after polls closed—an implausibly fast count for 40 million paper ballots—the Interior Ministry announced:

- Ahmadinejad: 62.6% (24.5 million votes)
- Mousavi: 33.8% (13.2 million votes)

Mousavi immediately rejected the results as "manipulation" and urged supporters to resist. Evidence cited for fraud included:

- Impossibly fast announcement
- Statistical anomalies in voting patterns
- Reports of ballot stuffing and pre-printed ballots
- Results inconsistent with regional and ethnic patterns[^7]

### June 15: The Great March

Three days after the election, an estimated 1-3 million people marched silently through Tehran from Revolution Square to Azadi (Freedom) Square—a nine-kilometer human river stretching across the capital. It was the largest demonstration in the Islamic Republic's 30-year history.

**Characteristics:**

- Overwhelmingly peaceful
- Green ribbons, scarves, and headbands
- Chants of "Where is my vote?"
- Women prominently participating
- Silence as protest tactic[^8]

---

## The Crackdown

### Violence and Repression

The regime responded with escalating force:

**Security Forces:**

- Revolutionary Guards
- Basij paramilitaries (often young men on motorcycles)
- Plainclothes agents
- Special police units

**Tactics:**

- Beatings of protesters
- Mass arrests (estimates range from 4,000 to 5,000)
- Shooting into crowds
- Attacks on student dormitories
- Detention and torture
- Show trials and forced confessions[^9]

### Neda Agha-Soltan

On June 20, 2009, 26-year-old Neda Agha-Soltan was shot in the chest near protest demonstrations in Tehran. Her death was captured on cell phone video—widely distributed despite internet restrictions—showing her dying in the arms of bystanders as blood pooled around her face.

**Impact:**

- Video viewed millions of times globally
- Neda became the movement's martyr
- International outrage at Iranian government
- Her image became iconic worldwide
- Government denied responsibility; claimed Western conspiracy[^10]

### Continued Protests (Summer-Winter 2009)

Despite the crackdown, protests continued on national holidays:

- **Quds Day (September 18):** Protesters turned annual anti-Israel march into anti-government demonstration; chants of "Death to the dictator" (not the usual "Death to America")
- **November 4:** Anniversary of US Embassy takeover used for protests
- **December 7:** Student Day protests
- **Ashura (December 27):** Religious mourning day saw violent clashes; at least 15 killed[^11]

### Kahrizak: Torture and Death

Some detained protesters were taken to Kahrizak detention center south of Tehran. Reports emerged of:

- Systematic torture
- Rape
- Deaths in custody

At least five detainees died at Kahrizak. The center was eventually closed on Khamenei's orders after the scandal—a rare acknowledgment of state abuse.[^12]

---

## Death Toll

Exact figures remain disputed:

**Official Government Figures:**

- 36 deaths during the protests

**Opposition and Human Rights Estimates:**

- Over 100 killed (possibly 250+)
- At least 15 killed on Ashura (December 27)
- 110 killed due to political violence (one tabulation)
- Over 4,000 arrested
- Unknown number tortured in detention[^13]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views (Pro-Democracy Perspective)

**Largest Challenge Since 1979:** The Green Movement was the most significant popular challenge to the Islamic Republic in its history, demonstrating that millions of Iranians sought fundamental change within or beyond the system.[^14]

**Global Inspiration:** The movement's use of social media, peaceful tactics, and green symbolism inspired subsequent movements in the region and globally. Many see the Green Movement as a precursor to the Arab Spring.[^15]

**Breaking Taboos:** Protesters openly chanted against the Supreme Leader—previously unthinkable. The movement revealed deep fractures within the regime and between state and society.[^16]

### Critical/Regime Perspective

**Regime Justification:**

- Election was legitimate and transparent
- Protests were "sedition" (fitneh) instigated by foreign powers
- Movement leaders were agents of the West
- Order was maintained to protect the Revolution

This narrative remains the official position of the Islamic Republic.[^17]

### Scholarly Analysis

**Limited Demands:** Some scholars note the movement initially sought only electoral reform, not regime change—a limitation that both gave it legitimacy and constrained its revolutionary potential.[^18]

**Social Movement Impact:** Even in defeat, the movement changed Iranian political culture, created new networks of activists (many now in diaspora), and demonstrated the potential for mass mobilization.[^19]

---

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Immediate Aftermath

- Movement suppressed by early 2010
- Mousavi and Karroubi placed under house arrest (February 2011)
- Many activists imprisoned, executed, or exiled
- Reformist participation in subsequent elections marginalized

### Connection to Later Protests

The Green Movement's legacy extended to:

- **2017-2018 Protests:** Economic grievances sparked nationwide demonstrations
- **November 2019 Protests:** Fuel price hike led to most violent government crackdown since 2009
- **2022 Mahsa Amini Protests:** "Woman, Life, Freedom" movement echoed Green Movement tactics and exceeded it in many ways

Each wave demonstrated continued demand for change despite escalating repression.[^20]

### International Impact

- Increased scrutiny of Iranian human rights record
- Demonstrated power and limits of social media organizing
- Influenced approach to election monitoring and fraud documentation
- Video of Neda's death became a defining image of citizen journalism[^21]

### Continuing Imprisonment

As of 2024:

- Mousavi and Karroubi remain under house arrest
- Their continued detention symbolizes the regime's refusal to reconcile
- Many 2009 prisoners remain incarcerated or live under restrictions[^22]
