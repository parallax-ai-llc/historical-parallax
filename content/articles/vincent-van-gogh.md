## Summary

Vincent Willem van Gogh (1853-1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most influential figures in Western art history. Having created approximately 2,100 artworks in just over a decade—including around 860 oil paintings—mostly in the final two years of his life, Van Gogh struggled with poverty, mental illness, and obscurity during his lifetime, selling only one painting before his death at 37. His bold colors, expressive brushwork, and emotional intensity in works like *The Starry Night*, *Sunflowers*, and self-portraits revolutionized art and influenced Expressionism and modern art. Van Gogh's tortured life, including the infamous ear incident and ultimate suicide, combined with his artistic genius, made him an archetypal "tormented artist."
