## Summary

Ajima Naonobu was a Japanese mathematician who developed the Malfatti circles (three circles packed inside a triangle), double integration techniques, and methods for computing the volume of intersection of two cylinders. His work on definite integrals predated or paralleled European developments. He was one of the greatest mathematicians of the Edo period.
