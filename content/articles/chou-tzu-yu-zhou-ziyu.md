## Summary

Chou Tzu-yu (周子瑜; born June 14, 1999), known mononymously as Tzuyu, is a Taiwanese singer, dancer, and model based in South Korea.[^1] She is a member of the internationally acclaimed K-pop girl group TWICE, formed by JYP Entertainment in 2015, where she serves as the lead dancer, sub-vocalist, visual, and maknae (youngest member).[^2] Nicknamed "Light of Taiwan" by Taiwanese media, Tzuyu became a symbol of Taiwanese pride and identity, particularly following the controversial 2016 flag incident that had significant political ramifications.[^3] Since her solo debut in 2024 with the EP *abouTZU*, she has continued to break boundaries as one of the most recognizable Taiwanese figures in global entertainment.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Chou Tzu-yu was born on June 14, 1999, in the East District of Tainan, Taiwan.[^1] She comes from an affluent family of self-made entrepreneurs; her parents, Huang Yenling and Chou Yicheng, owned a prominent night market business before investing in hospitals, plastic surgery clinics, and cafés.[^5] Tzuyu grew up with an older brother, born in 1992, who is seven years her senior.[^6] The family's entrepreneurial success provided Tzuyu with a stable and supportive upbringing that enabled her to pursue her passion for performing arts from a young age.[^7]

From childhood, Tzuyu displayed a keen interest in singing and dancing.[^8] She began training at the MUSE Performing Arts Workshop in her hometown of Tainan, where she honed her skills as a performer.[^9] Her natural talent and striking presence caught the attention of JYP Entertainment talent scouts during a workshop performance in 2012.[^10] Despite being only 13 years old, Tzuyu made the life-changing decision to leave Taiwan and move to South Korea in November 2012 to begin her training as a K-pop idol trainee.[^11]

The transition was challenging for the young teenager. Tzuyu later recalled the difficulties of this period: "It was tough for me because I came to Korea not knowing any Korean. I felt especially lonely when I missed my family or I came across a hard situation that I had to deal with alone."[^12] Despite these obstacles, she persevered through over two and a half years of rigorous training at JYP Entertainment, learning Korean, perfecting her dance skills, and developing her vocal abilities.[^13] During her trainee period, she appeared in music videos for labelmates including GOT7's "Stop stop it" and miss A's "Only You," gaining valuable experience before her official debut.[^14]

## Rise to Prominence

Tzuyu's path to stardom began in earnest when she participated in JYP Entertainment's reality survival show *Sixteen* in 2015.[^15] The program, co-produced by Mnet, pitted sixteen trainees against one another in a competition to secure one of seven spots in what would become the girl group TWICE.[^16] Initially, Tzuyu struggled with the competition's demands. JYP Park Jin-young acknowledged her progress during the show, stating he was proud of Tzuyu, who "improved the most in the show - starting from the bottom of the pool in overall skills to now being right in the middle."[^17]

In a dramatic turn during the final episode, Tzuyu was initially eliminated from the lineup.[^18] However, the show's producers had incorporated an online voting system that allowed viewers to select their favorite contestants. Tzuyu dominated the "Fan Favorite" voting, ranking first with overwhelming support from viewers.[^19] Recognizing her immense popularity, JYP Park Jin-young made the unprecedented decision to add two additional members to the group: Tzuyu, selected by audience vote, and Momo, selected by his own choice.[^20] The final viewer vote rankings showed Tzuyu in first place, followed by Nayeon (2nd), Jeongyeon (3rd), Mina (4th), Dahyun (5th), Sana (6th), and Chaeyoung (7th).[^21]

On October 20, 2015, Tzuyu officially debuted as a member of TWICE with the release of their first extended play, *The Story Begins*.[^22] The group's debut single "Like Ooh-Ahh" became a viral sensation, becoming the first K-pop debut song to reach 100 million views on YouTube—a remarkable achievement that signaled the beginning of TWICE's dominance in the K-pop industry.[^23] Tzuyu's striking visuals and graceful dancing immediately captured attention, and she quickly became one of the most recognizable members of the group.[^24]

Her beauty garnered international recognition when she ranked 13th on TC Candler's "100 Most Beautiful Faces" list in 2015, an impressive placement for a rookie idol.[^25] This was just the beginning of a steady climb: she rose to 8th in 2016, 3rd in 2017, 2nd in 2018, and finally reached the number one position in 2019, being crowned the world's most beautiful face.[^26] According to Gallup Korea's annual music survey, Tzuyu was the third most popular idol among South Koreans in 2016, further cementing her status as a rising star.[^27]

## Major Achievements

### Group Success with TWICE

As a member of TWICE, Tzuyu has achieved extraordinary commercial and critical success. The group has won numerous awards, including 20 MAMA Awards, 12 Golden Disc Awards, 10 Soribada Best K-Music Awards, 9 Japan Gold Disc Awards, 9 Asia Artist Awards, 7 Circle Chart Music Awards, 7 Seoul Music Awards, 5 Melon Music Awards, 5 Genie Music Awards, and 4 Fact Music Awards.[^28] TWICE has released multiple platinum-selling albums, with *Twicecoaster: Lane 1* becoming one of the best-selling albums by a girl group in Gaon Album Chart history with over 475,000 copies sold.[^29]

The group achieved significant milestones including their eleventh EP *Between 1&2* (2022), which became their first EP to sell over a million copies, and *Ready to Be* (2023), which became their best-selling EP in South Korea.[^30] Their album *With You-th* was the group's first number-one entry on the Billboard 200, showcasing TWICE's global reach.[^31] On March 1, 2023, TWICE was awarded the Breakthrough Artist at the 2023 Billboard Women in Music held in Los Angeles, marking the first time a female K-pop group has ever won the award.[^32]

### Solo Career and Artistic Development

On September 6, 2024, Tzuyu made her solo debut with the extended play *abouTZU*.[^33] The six-track album includes the lead single "Run Away," a synth-pop and disco-pop song composed by Andrea Rosario, Elsa Curran, Davin Kingston, and Johnny Simpson, with lyrics written by Park Jin-young.[^34] The EP also features collaborations with Peniel of BtoB on "Heartbreak in Heaven" and rapper pH-1 on "Lazy Baby."[^35] Notably, Tzuyu wrote the lyrics for the final track "Fly," a ballad that tells her personal story, marking her continued growth as a songwriter after her songwriting debut with "21:29" from TWICE's 2019 album *Feel Special*.[^36]

The commercial performance of *abouTZU* was impressive. Pre-order sales reached 467,500 copies worldwide, and the album sold 220,471 copies on its first day, making it the 7th highest-selling solo album among K-pop female artists on the Hanteo chart.[^37] In South Korea, the EP debuted at number 3 on the Circle Album Chart with 284,844 copies sold.[^38] Internationally, *abouTZU* debuted at number 19 on the Billboard 200 chart and reached No. 1 on Billboard's World Albums chart.[^39] The album also debuted at number 4 on Billboard's Vinyl Albums chart, making Tzuyu the first female K-pop soloist ever to break into the top 5 of this chart.[^40] The title track "Run Away" became her first number-one single on the Billboard Taiwan Songs chart and entered Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart at No. 6.[^41]

### Brand Endorsements and Modeling

Tzuyu's influence extends beyond music into fashion and beauty industries. In January 2022, she was chosen as the new muse of South Korean clothing brand Zooc.[^42] In October 2022, she was announced as the muse of Visée, one of Japan's most popular cosmetics brands.[^43] In October 2023, she was appointed as the global ambassador for the Pond's Skin Institute's Brand Evolution Campaign.[^44] Her endorsement portfolio also includes LG U+, Crocs Korea, Coach, and Estée Lauder.[^45]

Her modeling career has flourished alongside her music endeavors. She covered the October 2021 issue of L'Officiel Malaysia as a model for the Coach Fall/Winter 2021 collection.[^46] At 172 cm (5 feet 8 inches) tall, her height combined with her striking visuals has made her a sought-after figure in the fashion industry.[^47] A career highlight came when she performed at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2025, where the bra she wore reportedly sold out within days.[^48]

### Academic Achievement

In a remarkable demonstration of her commitment to personal growth, Tzuyu announced in 2024 that she had completed a master's degree in applied psychology from Miguel de Cervantes European University in Spain.[^49] She pursued the degree online for over a year during the COVID-19 pandemic when TWICE's group activities had slowed down, showcasing her dedication to education alongside her entertainment career.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The 2016 Flag Incident

The most significant controversy of Tzuyu's career occurred in late 2015 and early 2016, becoming known as the "Tzuyu Incident."[^51] On November 21, 2015, Tzuyu appeared with bandmates on the Korean variety show *My Little Television*, where she introduced herself as Taiwanese and held the flag of the Republic of China (Taiwan) alongside the South Korean flag.[^52] This seemingly innocuous act of representing her nationality triggered a major political firestorm.

On January 8, 2016, Huang An, a Taiwanese singer supporting Chinese unification, criticized Tzuyu on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, accusing her of being a "Taiwanese Separatist" and supporting Taiwan independence.[^53] Mainland Chinese internet users reacted with intense anger due to the ongoing political tensions between China and Taiwan.[^54] The backlash was swift and severe: TWICE was barred from Chinese television, and Tzuyu was pulled from her endorsement deal with Chinese communications company Huawei.[^55]

On January 15, 2016, just one day before Taiwan's presidential election, JYP Entertainment released a video showing 16-year-old Tzuyu reading an apology.[^56] In the poorly lit video that many compared to a hostage tape, Tzuyu stated: "There is only one China, the two sides of the strait are one, and I have always felt proud to be Chinese."[^57] The video sparked international outrage and became a symbol of China's political pressure on Taiwan.

### Political Ramifications

The incident had far-reaching political consequences. The apology video was released on election day in Taiwan and infuriated the Taiwanese public.[^58] Initially, Tzuyu's participation in *Sixteen* had been a matter of national pride for Taiwan, celebrating a Taiwanese contestant's success in an international competition.[^59] However, the forced apology transformed her into "a symbol of the island's civic pride, and China's heavy-handed attempts to stifle that pride."[^60]

A survey found that Tzuyu's video apology affected the decision of approximately 1.34 million young voters, either by swaying them to vote or changing their votes.[^61] Scholars believe the incident contributed one to two percentage points to Tsai Ing-wen's winning margin in the presidential election, which was won by the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).[^62] The incident was characterized in academic research as one of the most controversial events in recent years that significantly affected the cultural and political climate in Taiwan, while creating diplomatic tensions with China.[^63]

### Industry Impact and Ongoing Scrutiny

The controversy led to industry-wide changes. JYP Entertainment reportedly implemented cultural sensitivity training for its artists and staff members, including education on political conflicts between countries.[^64] The incident highlighted the precarious position of Asian artists navigating geopolitical tensions while representing their home countries in the global entertainment industry.[^65]

Even Tzuyu's charitable acts became subject to political scrutiny. When she donated 50 million won to South Korea and 300,000 RMB (approximately $42,900 USD) to China during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020—totaling $84,500 USD for coronavirus relief—Chinese netizens unfairly criticized her donations despite their generous nature.[^66]

### Response to Controversy

Despite the intense pressure and criticism, Tzuyu has handled the aftermath with grace and maturity. She has continued to identify as Taiwanese and has not retreated from her national identity, though she has been more cautious in public appearances regarding political matters.[^67] The incident remains a defining moment in discussions about Taiwan's international presence and the intersection of entertainment and politics in East Asia.[^68]

## Personal Life

### Family and Background

Tzuyu maintains a close relationship with her family in Taiwan despite her demanding career in South Korea. She has spoken fondly of her parents and older brother, who have been supportive of her career from the beginning.[^69] The family's entrepreneurial background in night market businesses, hospitals, and cafés provided Tzuyu with a privileged upbringing, though she has remained humble about her wealthy background.[^70]

### Personality Traits

According to her MBTI test results, Tzuyu is an ISFP-A personality type, known as the "Adventurer."[^71] This personality type is characterized by a creative and sensitive nature, with individuals being in tune with their emotions and expressing themselves through unique talents.[^72] True to this type, Tzuyu acknowledges her indecisiveness: "I can't make decisions on the spot. I hesitate."[^73]

Her TWICE bandmates have offered insights into her personality. Jeongyeon described Tzuyu as "very pure...and very neat," while Dahyun revealed that she is "funny and cute...And she's unexpectedly funny."[^74] Members have noted that she is "a lot more emotional and talkative than she shows on camera" and "more talkative and emotional off camera."[^75] Tzuyu herself has acknowledged this, stating: "I am coddled a lot because I'm the youngest, and I am kind of known to be quiet and shy. But I think — I hope — that this album kind of gives the fans a chance to discover new sides of me."[^76]

Despite her reserved nature, Tzuyu has grown more outgoing over the years. She was previously named as one of the most introverted K-pop idols but has learned to be more talkative as the years passed.[^77] She reflected on this in an interview: "It's always taken me a while to warm up to people. I'm still pretty reserved."[^78]

### Relationship with TWICE Members

Tzuyu has expressed deep gratitude and affection for her TWICE bandmates. In an interview with Cosmopolitan Korea, she stated: "TWICE is my greatest pride. These are members who have been with me for more than half of my life and they know everything from my good side to my dark side."[^79] She has acknowledged the support system they provide: "As a TWICE member, I could lean on my members to compensate for what I lack. But with this [solo work], I am solely responsible for everything."[^80]

### Charitable Work

Tzuyu has demonstrated a commitment to philanthropy throughout her career. On February 29, 2020, she donated ₩50 million (US$42,363) to the South Korean Community Chest to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.[^81] Additionally, she donated 300,000 RMB (approximately $42,900 USD) to China for coronavirus relief efforts.[^82] In May 2020, Tzuyu and fellow TWICE member Jeongyeon volunteered at an animal shelter despite their busy comeback schedule.[^83] Reports indicate she also flew to Cambodia to spend time with and provide for underprivileged children.[^84]

Through fan voting on Korean charity platforms, Tzuyu has been repeatedly honored as a "Charity Angel," with fans helping her hold the title for seven consecutive months, resulting in donations of millions of won being given to charity in her name.[^85] Most recently, CHOEAEDOL made a donation of ₩500,000 on behalf of Tzuyu to the MIRAL Welfare Foundation, a Korean charity organization that comprehensively addresses issues related to disabilities.[^86]

### Social Media Presence

In 2023, Tzuyu surpassed Jay Chou and became the most followed Taiwanese celebrity on Instagram with over 10 million followers, further cementing her status as Taiwan's most prominent international entertainment figure.[^87]

---

## Legacy

### Cultural Impact and Taiwan Representation

Tzuyu's most enduring legacy is her role as a symbol of Taiwanese identity and pride on the global stage. Taiwanese media nicknamed her "Light of Taiwan" (台灣之光), a term commonly used to refer to internationally famous Taiwanese people, those of Taiwanese descent, or Taiwanese products that bring pride to the nation.[^88] This moniker reflects the deep connection Taiwanese people feel toward Tzuyu, viewing her success as representative of Taiwan's cultural vitality and creative talent.[^89]

The 2016 flag incident, despite its painful nature, paradoxically strengthened Tzuyu's symbolic importance to Taiwan. What began as a moment of national pride during her *Sixteen* competition victory transformed into a galvanizing political moment.[^90] The forced apology awakened many young Taiwanese people to the political pressures facing their country and became a rallying point for Taiwanese identity.[^91] Political scientists have noted that the incident contributed to voter turnout and support for Taiwan's pro-independence forces, demonstrating how a cultural figure can inadvertently shape political consciousness.[^92]

### Breaking Barriers in K-pop

Tzuyu holds the distinction of being the first Taiwanese person to debut as a K-pop idol when TWICE launched in October 2015.[^93] This groundbreaking achievement paved the way for other Taiwanese artists in the Korean entertainment industry and demonstrated that K-pop's appeal and opportunities could extend beyond Korean nationals.[^94] Her success has shown that cultural exchange between Taiwan and South Korea can be mutually beneficial, with Taiwanese artists bringing their unique perspectives to Korean entertainment while Korean companies gain access to broader Asian markets.[^95]

Her TC Candler ranking journey—from 13th in 2015 to ultimately reaching number one in 2019 as the world's most beautiful face—represents not just personal achievement but also increased global visibility for Taiwanese beauty and culture.[^96] Her consistent high rankings over multiple years demonstrated sustained international appeal rather than fleeting popularity.[^97]

### Academic and Scholarly Interest

The "Tzuyu Scandal" has become a subject of academic study, with scholars examining how transnational cultural flows such as K-pop create intensified regional dynamics and conflicts.[^98] Academic papers have analyzed the incident as a case study in "the politics of apology," exploring how the video went viral among K-pop fans globally and created a transnational discursive space that captures complex dynamics among local media, transnational entertainment corporations, fans, and artists.[^99] This scholarly attention has elevated Tzuyu beyond mere celebrity status to a figure of sociological and political significance.[^100]

### Influence on Industry Practices

Following the flag controversy, the K-pop industry implemented changes in how it handles artists from politically sensitive regions. JYP Entertainment's implementation of cultural sensitivity training for artists and staff regarding political conflicts between countries has reportedly become more common across major entertainment companies.[^101] Tzuyu's experience highlighted the need for entertainment companies to better protect and prepare their artists for navigating geopolitical complexities.[^102]

### Fashion and Beauty Icon

Tzuyu's impact on fashion cannot be overstated. Her airport fashion became a major source of inspiration for the Korean general public, with images being "pinned and repinned on visual boards" as she became "a common go-to" for style inspiration.[^103] Her ability to influence consumer behavior was demonstrated when the bra she wore at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2025 sold out within days of her performance.[^104] This commercial influence has established her as not just a performer but a fashion trendsetter whose choices drive consumer decisions.[^105]

### Pioneering Solo Success

As the third member of TWICE to launch a solo career (following Nayeon and Jihyo), Tzuyu's *abouTZU* achieved remarkable commercial success, becoming the 2nd highest-charting female K-pop soloist on Billboard's Top Album Sales chart and the first female K-pop soloist to break into the top 5 of Billboard's Vinyl Albums chart.[^106] These achievements demonstrate that individual TWICE members can sustain successful solo careers while maintaining the group's collective identity, providing a model for other K-pop groups.[^107]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholars view Tzuyu as a groundbreaking cultural ambassador who has elevated Taiwan's international profile through her artistic talents and grace under pressure. Music industry analysts praise her evolution from a shy trainee who started "at the bottom of the pool" during *Sixteen* to becoming a multifaceted artist capable of carrying a solo career.[^108] Her ability to write meaningful lyrics, as demonstrated in songs like "21:29" and "Fly," showcases artistic depth beyond her visual appeal and dancing abilities.[^109]

Fashion critics have celebrated Tzuyu's influence on Asian beauty standards and her role in diversifying global perceptions of beauty. Her multiple appearances on TC Candler's prestigious list and ultimate crowning as the world's most beautiful face in 2019 are seen as validation of Asian beauty on the global stage.[^110] Fashion industry professionals note that her 172 cm height and proportions have made her an ideal model for both Western and Eastern fashion markets, breaking down barriers in an industry that has historically favored Western aesthetics.[^111]

Cultural commentators emphasize her dignity in handling the 2016 flag controversy. Despite being only 16 years old when forced to make a humiliating apology, Tzuyu maintained her composure and professionalism.[^112] She neither lashed out publicly nor retreated from public life, instead continuing to work hard and let her achievements speak for themselves.[^113] This resilience has been interpreted as representing the Taiwanese spirit—persistent, dignified, and committed to excellence despite external pressures.[^114]

Entertainment industry professionals highlight her work ethic and dedication. The revelation that she completed a master's degree in applied psychology while maintaining her rigorous performance schedule demonstrates intellectual curiosity and time management skills that exceed typical entertainment industry standards.[^115] Her commitment to charitable causes, including substantial COVID-19 relief donations to both South Korea and China despite previous Chinese criticism, reflects a generous spirit focused on humanitarian concerns rather than political calculations.[^116]

Fans (known as ONCE) celebrate Tzuyu's loyalty to TWICE and her humble nature despite enormous fame. Her statement that "TWICE is my greatest pride" resonates with those who value loyalty and team spirit.[^117] Fellow members' descriptions of her as "pure," "neat," and "unexpectedly funny" paint a picture of an authentic person who hasn't been corrupted by fame.[^118]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Tzuyu's 2016 apology, regardless of whether it was coerced, damaged Taiwan's international standing by appearing to validate the "One China" policy before a global audience.[^119] Some Taiwanese nationalists felt betrayed by her statement that she had "always felt proud to be Chinese," even though context suggests the statement was scripted by her management company.[^120] These critics contend that she should have refused to apologize or left the group rather than make statements contradicting Taiwan's democratic sovereignty.[^121]

Some observers question whether Tzuyu has done enough to reclaim her Taiwanese identity following the controversy. They note that while she hasn't repeated such apologies, she also hasn't explicitly repudiated them or made strong public statements affirming Taiwan's independence.[^122] These critics acknowledge the difficult position she faces but argue that her silence on political matters since 2016 represents a form of complicity with Chinese political pressure.[^123]

Within the K-pop community, some critics have questioned whether Tzuyu's success is disproportionately based on visual appeal rather than musical talent. While acknowledging her dancing abilities, they point out that she has fewer vocal lines in TWICE songs compared to members like Nayeon and Jihyo, and her songwriting contributions have been limited.[^124] These critics suggest that her overwhelming popularity in early rankings and fan votes was primarily appearance-based, potentially overshadowing more musically skilled members.[^125]

Music critics have offered mixed reviews of her solo work. While *abouTZU* achieved commercial success, some reviewers noted that its musical style closely followed JYP Entertainment's established formulas rather than showcasing a distinctive artistic vision.[^126] The fact that Park Jin-young wrote the lyrics for the lead single "Run Away" rather than Tzuyu herself (she only wrote lyrics for the final track) suggests to some critics that she hasn't fully developed an independent artistic voice.[^127]

Some Chinese netizens have never forgiven Tzuyu for the 2015 flag incident and continue to criticize her actions on social media, even questioning her charitable donations during COVID-19.[^128] These critics view any expression of Taiwanese identity as a political provocation and maintain that her apology was insufficient.[^129]

Business analysts have questioned the sustainability of Tzuyu's endorsement career, noting that the flag controversy permanently closed the lucrative Chinese market to her, potentially limiting her long-term commercial value compared to K-pop artists who can work freely in both China and other markets.[^130] Her inability to participate in TWICE's Chinese promotional activities represents a significant career limitation.[^131]
