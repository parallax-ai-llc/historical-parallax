## Overview
On June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie were shot dead in Sarajevo by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Young Bosnia movement. This political assassination is considered the immediate catalyst for World War I.

## The Event
The royal couple was visiting Sarajevo to inspect military maneuvers. Despite an earlier failed bombing attempt on their motorcade, they decided to continue their visit. As their driver took a wrong turn, Gavrilo Princip seized the opportunity and fired two shots, killing both the Archduke and the Duchess.

## Aftermath
The assassination triggered a diplomatic domino effect known as the July Crisis. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, and due to a web of alliances, Russia, Germany, France, and Britain were soon drawn into the conflict, beginning the First World War.
