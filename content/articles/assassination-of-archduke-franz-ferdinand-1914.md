## Overview

The assassination of **Archduke Franz Ferdinand**, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife **Sophie**, is the single most consequential murder in human history. It set off a chain reaction of alliances that led to World War I, resulting in 20 million deaths and the fall of the Russian, German, Ottoman, and Austro-Hungarian empires. The assassin was **Gavrilo Princip**, a 19-year-old Serbian nationalist seeking to liberate South Slavs from Austrian rule.

## The Black Hand

Princip was one of six assassins sent by the **Black Hand**, a secret military society in Serbia. They were young, untrained, and suffering from tuberculosis (Princip was dying anyway).
They lined the Appel Quay (road along the river) waiting for the Archduke's motorcade.
**The Failed Attempt:**
At 10:10 AM, Nedeljko Čabrinović threw a grenade. It bounced off the Archduke's convertible roof and exploded under the car behind. The Archduke was unharmed. He famously yelled at the Mayor later: *"I come to Sarajevo as a guest and I am greeted with bombs. It is outrageous!"*

## The Wrong Turn

The Archduke decided to visit the injured officers in the hospital.
However, the drivers were not told of the change in route.
The lead car turned right onto Franz Josef Street (the original route). The Archduke's driver followed.
General Potiorek screamed: *"Stop! What are you doing? We are going the wrong way!"*
The driver braked to reverse. The gears jammed.
**Fate:**
The car stopped exactly in front of Schiller's Delicatessen, where Gavrilo Princip was standing, dejected after the earlier failure.
Princip couldn't believe his luck. He stepped forward and fired two shots from his FN Model 1910 pistol.
- First shot: Hit Sophie in the abdomen.
- Second shot: Hit Franz Ferdinand in the neck (jugular).
The Archduke's last words were: *"Sophie, Sophie! Don't die! Live for our children!"*

## The July Crisis

The assassination did not cause war immediately. It triggered the **July Crisis**:
1.  Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia (designed to be rejected).
2.  Germany gave Austria a "Blank Check" of support.
3.  Russia mobilized to warn Austria.
4.  Germany declared war on Russia and France.
5.  Germany invaded neutral Belgium to get to France (Schlieffen Plan).
6.  Britain declared war on Germany.
By August 4, the world was at war.

## Aftermath for Princip

Princip was too young (under 20) to receive the death penalty. He was sentenced to 20 years.
He died in prison in 1918 of tuberculosis, weighing only 40kg and missing an arm (amputated due to bone disease). He never lived to see the country he dreamed of (Yugoslavia) formed.
