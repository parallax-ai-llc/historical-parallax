## Summary

On February 22, 2019, Algerians poured into the streets in the largest protests their country had seen in decades. The trigger: the announcement that President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, then 82, partially paralyzed, and rarely seen in public since a 2013 stroke, would seek a fifth term. Outraged citizens saw this as an insult—proof that behind "le pouvoir" (the power), an unaccountable elite ran the country. Within weeks, millions were marching.[^1]

The movement became known as "Hirak" (movement) or the "Revolution of Smiles"—for its remarkable peacefulness and humor. Every Friday, Algerians demonstrated in a festival-like atmosphere, demanding the entire system step down: "Yetnahaw ga'a" (They all must go). On April 2, 2019, Bouteflika resigned—the first time since the Arab Spring that peaceful protests had toppled a leader. But the Hirak continued, rejecting the December 2019 election won by regime insider Abdelmadjid Tebboune amid record-low turnout.[^2]

The COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 halted the weekly marches. When protests resumed, authorities cracked down: hundreds were arrested, activists imprisoned, and civil liberties narrowed. The Hirak achieved the departure of Bouteflika but not the systemic change it demanded. Yet its legacy—a generation politicized, taboos broken—endures as unfinished business.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Algeria's Political System

Since independence from France (1962):

- **FLN (National Liberation Front):** Dominated politics
- **Military:** Power behind civilian facade
- **"Le Pouvoir":** Informal power structure—generals, intelligence, business elite
- **Civil War (1990s):** 150,000+ killed after Islamists' victory annulled; military rule consolidated

Bouteflika came to power in 1999, promising reconciliation and stability.[^4]

### Bouteflika's Rule (1999-2019)

- Early years: Popular; ended civil war; amnesty programs
- 2008: Constitution amended to remove term limits
- 2013: Suffered stroke; became largely incapacitated
- Rarely seen; communications through intermediaries
- Fourth term (2014): Won with 81% amid questions about his capacity
- 2019: Fifth term announcement seen as final humiliation[^5]

### Youth Grievances

By 2019, Algeria faced:

- 30% youth unemployment
- Housing crisis
- Corruption pervasive
- Oil prices low; economy stagnating
- Generational divide: 70% under 30; youth frustrated with gerontocracy[^6]

## The Hirak

### The Spark (February 2019)

**February 10, 2019:** Bouteflika announced fifth-term bid
**February 16:** First protest in Kherrata (Kabylia)
**February 22:** Massive demonstrations nationwide—Algiers, Oran, Constantine, and dozens of cities

The protests caught everyone off guard—including the protesters.[^7]

### Characteristics

**"Revolution of Smiles":**

- Remarkably peaceful
- Festive atmosphere; humor; music; art
- Interclass: Workers, professionals, students, pensioners
- Cross-regional: Berber (Kabylie), Arab, Saharan regions
- Football ultras helped organize

**Slogans:**

- "Yetnahaw ga'a" (They all must go)
- "1, 2, 3, viva l'Algérie!" (football chant repurposed)
- "Système dégage" (System go away)

**Tactics:**

- Friday marches (after prayers)
- Student Tuesday protests
- General strikes[^8]

### Bouteflika's Fall

**March 2019:** Bouteflika withdrew candidacy; postponed elections; promised transition. Protestors rejected this as insufficient.

**April 2, 2019:** Under military pressure (General Ahmed Gaïd Salah), Bouteflika resigned—first Arab Spring-style leader-fall since 2011.

But the military, not the Hirak, controlled the transition.[^9]

---

## Post-Bouteflika Transition

### Military Control

General Gaïd Salah became the key figure:

- Aligned with protests against Bouteflika
- Then demanded protests stop
- Oversaw interim government; crackdowns

### December 2019 Election

The regime pushed forward elections despite Hirak opposition:

**December 12, 2019:** Abdelmadjid Tebboune elected president

- Official turnout: 40% (likely lower)
- Hirak boycotted; viewed Tebboune as regime continuation
- Protests continued against the election

Tebboune was Bouteflika's former prime minister—hardly the change Hirak sought.[^10]

### Crackdowns

After Bouteflika's fall, arrests increased:

- Activists, journalists, lawyers targeted
- Charges: "Undermining national unity," "harming army morale"
- By late 2019: 180+ Hirak prisoners
- Key figures imprisoned: Karim Tabbou, Abdelwahab Fersaoui, Lakhdar Bouregaa

Old regime figures also prosecuted—but for show, not systemic reform.[^11]

---

## COVID and Decline

**March 2020:** COVID-19 pandemic

- Friday marches halted
- Authorities used pandemic for further crackdowns
- Activists arrested at home
- Media restricted

**2021-2022:** Attempted revival met with repression

- Marches smaller; heavily policed
- Arrests continued
- Movement fragmented

The Hirak's mass phase ended, though its spirit remained.[^12]

## Key Figures

### Hirak

| Name/Group             | Role                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Decentralized movement | No single leader                         |
| Football ultras        | Organizing, chants                       |
| Karim Tabbou           | Opposition figure (FFS); imprisoned      |
| Lakhdar Bouregaa       | Independence war veteran; arrested at 86 |
| Mohamed Tadjadit       | "Poet of the Hirak"                      |

### Regime

| Name                 | Role                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Abdelaziz Bouteflika | President 1999-2019; resigned  |
| Ahmed Gaïd Salah     | Army chief; died December 2019 |
| Abdelmadjid Tebboune | President from December 2019   |

## Death Toll

**The Hirak was remarkably peaceful:**

- No confirmed protest deaths from security forces during main phase (2019)
- Some isolated incidents; a few deaths reported
- Repression was primarily through arrests, not lethal force

This distinguished Algeria from Sudan, where security forces massacred protesters.[^13]

## Historical Assessment

### Hirak Perspective

**Historic Achievement:** The Hirak achieved what seemed impossible—removing Bouteflika and breaking the taboo of public dissent. It demonstrated that Algerians, despite decades of repression and the trauma of the 1990s civil war, could mobilize peacefully and massively. A generation was politicized.[^14]

**Incomplete Revolution:** The Hirak removed Bouteflika but not the system. The same elites—army, intelligence, business—remain. Elections were cosmetic. Political prisoners fill jails. The movement's demands for genuine democracy remain unfulfilled.

### Regime Perspective

**Official Narrative:** The government claims to have heard the protesters—removing Bouteflika, prosecuting some corrupt figures, holding elections. Tebboune promised constitutional reform. The state frames ongoing protests as destabilization, foreign interference, or separatism (especially in Kabylie).

### Critical Analysis

**Structural Power:** The Algerian military, unlike in Tunisia, was never divided and never ceded real power. The system absorbed Bouteflika's departure without fundamental change.

**Fear of 1990s:** The memory of civil war made Algerians—and the military—cautious about escalation. The "revolution of smiles" was peaceful partly because both sides feared violence.[^15]

## Legacy

### For Algeria

- Politicized post-independence generation
- Broken fear barrier
- February 22 commemorated
- Political prisoners a continuing issue
- System intact but delegitimized

### For the Region

- Connected to 2019 global protest wave (Sudan, Hong Kong, Chile)
- Showed Arab publics not passive
- But also showed limits of peaceful protest against entrenched militaries

### Unfinished Business

The Hirak's demands—transparent elections, civilian rule, end to corruption—remain relevant. The movement may have paused, not ended.[^16]
