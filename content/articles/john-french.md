## Summary

Field Marshal John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres (1852-1925), was a senior British Army officer who commanded the British Expeditionary Force during the crucial early period of World War I from August 1914 to December 1915.[^1] He rose to national prominence during the Second Boer War for his brilliant cavalry leadership, particularly the relief of Kimberley.[^2] However, his tenure as Commander-in-Chief in France was marred by heavy casualties, poor relations with allies and subordinates, and involvement in the 1915 Shell Crisis, leading to his forced resignation.[^3] He subsequently served as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland during the tumultuous period of 1918-1921, facing the Irish War of Independence.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

John Denton Pinkstone French was born on September 28, 1852, in Ripple, Kent, England, into a family with strong naval traditions.[^5] His father, Royal Navy Commander John Tracey William French, had fought at the Battle of Navarino and under Admiral Napier in the Portuguese Civil War.[^6] Tragedy struck early in young John's life when his father died when he was only two years old, and shortly thereafter his mother was committed to a mental institution.[^7] Consequently, he was raised by his older sisters, particularly Charlotte, who was devoted to her youngest brother and took responsibility for his early education, teaching him his letters.[^8]

French was educated at a Harrow preparatory school and subsequently attended Eastman's Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth, following his family's naval heritage.[^9] From August 1866, he trained aboard the three-decker battleship HMS Britannia at Dartmouth.[^10] However, his naval career proved short-lived—he obtained only an "average" certificate which required him to complete an additional six months of training aboard the frigate HMS Bristol at Sheerness from January 1868 before qualifying as a midshipman.[^11] His decision to leave the Navy came after discovering he had a severe fear of heights, which would have severely limited his prospects at sea.[^12] In 1874, at age 22, he transferred to the Army, beginning what would become a distinguished, if controversial, military career that would span four decades.[^13]

## Rise to Power

French's early military career followed the typical pattern of late Victorian officers, with much of his service in Africa and India.[^14] He was part of the ill-fated Gordon Relief Expedition to Sudan in 1884-1885, where he served as second-in-command to Lieutenant Colonel Percy Barrow with the cavalry accompanying Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Stewart across 176 miles of desert.[^15] During this campaign, French distinguished himself as commander of the rearguard during the retreat after Khartoum fell to the Mahdist forces and General Gordon was killed.[^16] Most of the cavalry work involved reconnaissance and warding off Dervish raids, though they pursued the retreating enemy at a walk after the Battle of Abu Klea in January 1885.[^17]

From 1891, French served in India, continuing to build his reputation as a capable cavalry officer.[^18] However, it was the Second Boer War (1899-1902) that transformed French from a competent officer into a national hero. His brilliant leadership of British cavalry against the Boers became the stuff of legend.[^19] French commanded the troops that relieved the Siege of Kimberley, forcing the passage of the Modder River and, with two cavalry brigades in open order at the gallop, clearing the road to Kimberley and relieving the besieged town.[^20] At Abon's Dam, five miles north of the Modder, French sent his cavalry, supported by the fire of 56 guns, charging up a valley between two Boer-held ridges, with the 9th and 16th Lancers leading the charge.[^21] The Official History called it "the most brilliant stroke of the war."[^22]

French ran rings around the Boer commandos and "virtually cleared Cape Colony of invaders," sweeping all before him at Paardeberg, Poplar Grove, and Driefontein.[^23] He was proud of having achieved "moral ascendancy" over the Boers despite his force of 2,000 men being outnumbered two to one.[^24] For this campaign, he was made a substantive major-general and created K.C.B., and at the war's conclusion, French was promoted lieutenant-general and created K.C.M.G.[^25] His success in South Africa propelled him to the highest ranks of the British Army. He became Chief of the Imperial General Staff on March 15, 1912, though he notably lacked staff experience and had never studied at Staff College.[^26] He was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal in June 1913.[^27]

## Major Achievements

French's pre-war accomplishments were considerable, particularly his cavalry innovations and his performance in the Boer War. However, his role as Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in the opening phase of World War I represents his most significant, albeit controversial, achievement.[^28] When war was declared in August 1914, French was appointed to command the BEF, which consisted initially of four infantry divisions and one cavalry division—approximately 90,000 men of highly-trained, long-service volunteers.[^29] The BEF was organized into I Corps under General Sir Douglas Haig and II Corps under General Sir James Grierson.[^30]

French led the BEF into its first major engagement at the Battle of Mons in August 1914, where, although outnumbered, British forces fought well and inflicted disproportionate casualties on the Germans before being forced to retreat when the French Fifth Army suddenly withdrew, exposing the British right flank.[^31] During the subsequent retreat, French was criticized for his failure to coordinate the movement of his two corps or even to remain in touch with their commanders.[^32] After a costly battle at Le Cateau, he appeared to lose his nerve and planned to withdraw south of the Seine River and perhaps from France altogether, before being persuaded otherwise.[^33]

The First Battle of Ypres (October-November 1914) saw the BEF sustain devastating casualties—58,155 British losses, mostly pre-war professional soldiers.[^34] Despite these losses, the BEF held the line and prevented a German breakthrough. In March 1915, French initiated the Battle of Neuve Chapelle, the BEF's first major offensive operation.[^35] French was convinced that a major effort would bring about an early victory, and at Haig's request, he released the 5th Cavalry Brigade to exploit the expected breakthrough.[^36] The initial assault showed promise with effective artillery preparation, but ultimately French was forced to abandon the offensive on March 15 due to the shortage of field-gun ammunition.[^37]

His term as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (1912-1914) was cut short by the Curragh Incident of March 1914, in which French initialed written assurances that officers would not be sent on military operations into Ulster against loyalists opposing Irish Home Rule.[^38] Both French and Secretary of State for War J.E.B. Seely were forced to resign on April 6, 1914, in one of the few occasions since the English Civil War in which elements of the British military openly intervened in politics.[^39] Despite this setback, he was appointed BEF commander just four months later when war broke out.

## Controversies and Criticisms

French's command of the BEF was plagued by controversies that ultimately ended his tenure and tarnished his reputation. He was temperamentally unsuited to command of the BEF, becoming so depressed at the prospects of success following the Mons campaign that his chief concern became the safe welfare of his troops, to the cost of his French allies.[^40] Once the war of maneuver ended, French's mood switched to one of over-optimism.[^41] He was considered unable to adapt himself to the unfamiliar conditions of modern warfare or to work harmoniously with the British government, his own subordinates, or the French and Belgian generals with whom he was supposed to cooperate.[^42]

The Shell Crisis of 1915 represented perhaps French's most damaging controversy. In May 1915, he leaked information about shell shortages to The Times war correspondent Colonel Charles à Court Repington in the hope of engineering Lord Kitchener's removal as Secretary of State for War.[^43] French had been at odds with Kitchener—a personality clash that originated during their service in the Boer War—and hoped that by leaking the story to the press, Kitchener would be forced from government.[^44] Following the failed Battle of Aubers Ridge on May 9, 1915, Repington sent a telegram blaming lack of high-explosive shells, with The Times headline on May 14, 1915 reading: "Need for shells: British attacks checked: Limited supply the cause."[^45] The scandal led to the fall of the Liberal government and the appointment of David Lloyd George as Minister of Munitions.[^46] French was tarnished by his blatant meddling in politics, a factor that contributed to his enforced resignation.[^47]

The Battle of Loos in September 1915 sealed French's fate. He refused to release two reserve divisions (21st and 24th) to Haig's command before the battle, keeping them six miles from the battlefield on September 25.[^48] When Haig requested IX Corps for potential reserve use that day, French argued they would not be required until the following morning.[^49] The troops were eventually released during the early afternoon but arrived too late to exploit the initial British success after marching 50 miles in four days.[^50] French's slow release of XI Corps from reserve was blamed for the failure to achieve a decisive breakthrough on the first day.[^51] By summer 1915, French's command was being increasingly criticized in London by Kitchener and other government members, and by Douglas Haig, William Robertson, and other senior generals in France.[^52]

The battles fought under his direction at Ypres and elsewhere were noteworthy in Britain for extraordinarily high numbers of British losses—more than 117,000 casualties in the first two battles of Ypres alone.[^53] The Second Battle of Ypres in 1915 saw 59,000 British casualties.[^54] Haig worked tirelessly to undermine French's authority during 1915, even telling King George V that French was "a source of great weakness to the army and no one had confidence in him any more" before replacing him as commander in December 1915.[^55] French resigned under pressure on December 17, 1915, and was succeeded by Douglas Haig.[^56]

## Personal Life

In 1880, John French married Eleanora Anna Selby-Lowndes (born 1844, died 1941), who would later become Countess of Ypres and serve as a war-worker and president of the Queen Alexandra's Field Force Fund.[^57] They had three children: John Richard Lowndes French, born in 1881; Edward Gerald Fleming French, born in 1883; and Essex Eleanor French, born in 1886.[^58] 

His eldest son, John Richard Lowndes French, followed his father by joining the army and serving with the Royal Field Artillery, but his military career was cut short following a riding accident.[^59] The younger French was also a talented artist, something that did not endear him to his father.[^60] Edward Gerald Fleming French became an English cricketer.[^61]

French's closest family relationship was with his sister Charlotte, who had raised him after their parents' deaths.[^62] However, this bond was severely tested by their political differences. Ironically, Charlotte Despard (her married name) became one of Britain's leading anti-war campaigners while her brother commanded British forces during World War I.[^63] Despite their close childhood relationship and Charlotte's devotion to her brother, they remained close throughout the First World War until Charlotte declared her support for Irish home rule and later independence.[^64] As Lord Lieutenant of Ireland from 1918 to 1921, French was tasked with trying to suppress the very people his sister supported, and their previously close relationship suffered badly.[^65]

French was unsuited by temperament and experience for high administrative positions like Chief of the Imperial General Staff.[^66] His memoirs revealed a tendency to revise history—at the time he wrote in his diary that French General Lanrezac was "a very capable soldier," although he claimed otherwise in his memoirs, and his account of events often conflicted with contemporary records.[^67]

## Legacy

After his removal from command of the BEF, French was created a viscount in 1916.[^68] He served as Commander-in-Chief in the United Kingdom for the remainder of World War I.[^69] In May 1918, he was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, a position he held through much of the Irish War of Independence until April 1921.[^70] French, who considered Ireland "unfit for Home Rule" and was an Irish unionist by conviction, never proved sympathetic to Irish nationalist aspirations.[^71] Under French, the Lord Lieutenant position was temporarily recast as a kind of military governor of Ireland.[^72]

His first major act as Lord-Lieutenant was participating in the arrests of 70 prominent members of Sinn Féin arising from the so-called "German plot."[^73] In July 1919, he banned Sinn Féin and the Volunteers as "dangerous organisations," and in September 1919, he banned the republicans' self-declared parliament, the Dáil, in response to the shooting of Dublin Police detectives.[^74] In December 1919, a group of IRA men attempted to assassinate French in Phoenix Park; the attack was a disaster, and French, who was hit on the head by a hand grenade, narrowly escaped.[^75] His health declined in 1920, and though he held the position of Lord Lieutenant until April 1921, his central role in Irish affairs was eclipsed by new Chief Secretary Sir Hamar Greenwood.[^76] He could never live in Ireland after the War of Independence.[^77]

In 1922, his rank was elevated to Earl of Ypres, honoring his leadership during the defense of that city.[^78] He spent his final years as the captain of Deal Castle near where he grew up in Kent, suffering from bladder cancer before dying on May 22, 1925.[^79]

French published his memoirs, titled "1914," in 1919 after returning to Britain.[^80] The book has been called "one of the most unfortunate books ever written" and was badly received by critics.[^81] Reading it, one would believe that the only person who didn't make a mistake was Sir John French himself, and he reserved particular venom for General Smith-Dorrien, who may well have been the savior of the British Army during the retreat from Mons.[^82] Widespread controversy followed, as the numerous colleagues whom French had accused of incompetence responded to his criticisms, further lowering his reputation.[^83]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Before World War I, French earned genuine acclaim for his cavalry leadership. Leo Amery's Times History, though highly critical of British generalship during the Boer War period, later wrote of French's "almost unbroken series of successes," showing his grasp of tactics.[^84] Richard Holmes, the military historian, defended French against some of the criticisms in The Times History, particularly regarding French's failure to concentrate his forces, which Holmes viewed as unfair.[^85] The Times History praised French's rapidity of movement during the Boer War.[^86]

During the early days of World War I, French faced an unprecedented challenge—commanding a small professional force in a continental war against a much larger enemy. Some historians acknowledge that the strategic situation French inherited was extraordinarily difficult, with the BEF operating as a relatively small force alongside much larger French armies, creating inherent coordination challenges. His cavalry background had prepared him well for mobile warfare, and he showed competence during the war of movement in 1914.

The relief of Kimberley and his performance at Klip Drift during the Boer War demonstrated French's capability for bold, decisive action when operating independently with cavalry forces. His promotion to Field Marshal in 1913 reflected the high regard in which he was held by the military establishment before the Great War.

### Negative Views

The historical consensus on French's World War I command is overwhelmingly negative. While he showed tactical competence in earlier conflicts, his WWI command was marred by heavy casualties and command difficulties that ultimately led to his forced resignation.[^87] Historians note that while French made a significant contribution to modern warfare, criticisms of his command style and the heavy British casualties under his leadership led to his resignation after approximately 18 months on the Western Front.[^88]

French was temperamentally unsuited for the demands of commanding a mass army in industrialized warfare. His tendency to swing between depression and over-optimism, his inability to work harmoniously with allies and subordinates, and his failure to adapt to the unfamiliar conditions of trench warfare represented fundamental flaws in his leadership.[^89] The Shell Crisis, in which French engaged in blatant political meddling, demonstrated poor judgment and damaged both his reputation and that of the British high command.[^90]

The Battle of Loos controversy, where French's mishandling of reserves cost the British a potential breakthrough, exemplified his tactical failures and sealed his fate.[^91] His memoir "1914" further damaged his historical reputation, with its inaccuracies and self-serving accounts alienating former colleagues and historians alike.[^92] Modern scholarship generally views French as a competent nineteenth-century cavalry commander who was promoted beyond his abilities and proved unable to meet the demands of twentieth-century total war.
