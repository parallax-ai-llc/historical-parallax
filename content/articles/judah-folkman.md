## Summary

Judah Folkman pioneered the field of angiogenesis research, proposing in 1971 that tumors require new blood vessels to grow and that blocking angiogenesis could treat cancer. Initially met with skepticism, his theory was eventually validated and led to the development of anti-angiogenic cancer drugs like bevacizumab (Avastin). His work transformed cancer treatment approaches.
