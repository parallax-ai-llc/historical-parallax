## Summary

Menachem Begin (1913-1992) was the sixth Prime Minister of Israel, serving from 1977 to 1983, and a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978 for negotiating the Camp David Accords with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat[^1][^2]. Born in Brest-Litovsk, Poland, Begin led the Irgun underground resistance movement against British rule in Palestine before becoming a founding member of the Herut party and later the Likud coalition[^3][^4]. His legacy remains deeply contested, celebrated by supporters as a champion of Jewish dignity and peacemaker, while critics point to his leadership of operations involving civilian casualties and his role in the 1982 Lebanon War[^5][^6]. Begin transformed from a militant underground leader branded as a terrorist by the British into a Nobel laureate, embodying the complexities and contradictions of Israeli political history[^7].

## Early Life and Background

Menachem Begin was born on August 16, 1913, to Zeev Dov and Hassia Begin in Brest-Litovsk, then part of the Russian Empire (now Brest, Belarus)[^8]. He was the youngest of three children, with siblings Herzl and Rachel, in a family of orthodox Jews deeply committed to Zionism[^9]. His father worked tirelessly for the Zionist cause, instilling in young Menachem a passionate dedication to the dream of Jewish return to Palestine that would define his entire life[^10].

The Begin family's early years were marked by the upheaval of World War I, when they were forced to flee into Russia before returning to Brest at the war's conclusion to find themselves in newly independent Poland[^11]. As a child, Menachem witnessed the growing anti-Semitism that plagued Jewish communities in Eastern Europe: rocks breaking windows in Jewish homes, confiscatory and discriminatory taxation levied against Jews by the Polish government, and Jewish students beaten by their peers[^12]. In one particularly traumatic incident, the young Begin watched several leading Jewish citizens receive twenty-five lashes in a public park for alleged "sympathy with Bolsheviks," an experience that would profoundly shape his worldview[^13].

Begin's education reflected the dual nature of Jewish life in interwar Poland. Like his brother Herzl, Menachem first attended a traditional Jewish school (cheder) before moving to a modern humanist Jewish school called Tachkemoni, which operated under the auspices of the religious Zionist movement Mizrachi[^14]. When he turned 14, he enrolled at the Polish state-run Romuald Traugutt High School, where he navigated the tensions between his Jewish identity and the increasingly hostile Polish nationalist environment[^15]. He later studied law at the University of Warsaw, graduating in 1935 with a degree that would prove useful in his later political career[^16].

From early on, Menachem's Zionist upbringing under his father's wing proved more formative than his formal education. When Menachem was 12, his father formalized the inculcation of Zionist ideals by sending all his children to the Hashomer Hatzair youth organization, where Zeev Dov himself served as chairman of the committee[^17]. However, young Menachem soon gravitated toward Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionism and joined the Betar youth movement in his teens[^18]. His oratorical skills and organizational abilities quickly became apparent, and he rose through the ranks with remarkable speed. By 1938, at just 25 years old, Begin became the head of Betar Poland, an organization boasting 100,000 members, demonstrating both his leadership capabilities and the appeal of Jabotinsky's more militant brand of Zionism among Polish Jewish youth[^19].

## Rise to Power

Begin's path to prominence was forged through suffering, resistance, and unwavering commitment to Zionist ideals during some of the darkest periods of modern Jewish history. When World War II began, Begin fled eastward ahead of the Nazi invasion, only to be arrested by Soviet authorities in Vilnius in 1940[^20]. Charged with being an "element dangerous to society" due to his Zionist activities, he was sentenced to eight years of hard labor in the Soviet Gulag system[^21]. Begin spent grueling months in Siberian labor camps, an experience that hardened his resolve and deepened his understanding of totalitarian oppression.

His fortunes changed in 1942 when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union, prompting Stalin to release Polish prisoners to form a Polish army-in-exile under General Władysław Anders[^22]. Begin joined this force and eventually arrived in Palestine in 1942 as part of the Polish army stationed in the Middle East[^23]. After his release from military service in 1943, Begin faced a momentous decision: the Irgun Zvai Leumi (National Military Organization), a right-wing Zionist paramilitary group, needed new leadership, and Begin was offered command[^24].

On February 1, 1944, Begin proclaimed a revolt against the British Mandatory government, marking the beginning of a campaign that would make him one of the most wanted men in Palestine[^25]. Under Begin's command, the Irgun launched a systematic campaign against British military and administrative targets, seeking to make British rule untenable and force a withdrawal that would pave the way for Jewish statehood[^26]. The British placed a substantial bounty on his head, and Begin lived underground for years, adopting various disguises and safe houses while directing operations[^27].

The most notorious incident under Begin's leadership was the King David Hotel bombing on July 22, 1946, when Irgun operatives disguised as Arab workers planted explosives in the basement of the building that housed British military and administrative headquarters[^28]. The explosion killed 91 people—British, Arab, and Jewish—and injured 45 more[^29]. Begin maintained that the Irgun had made telephone calls warning of the explosives, but controversy persists over whether these warnings were adequate or properly communicated[^30]. The incident branded Begin as a terrorist in British eyes, though his supporters viewed him as a freedom fighter employing necessary tactics against colonial oppression.

When Israel declared independence in May 1948, the Irgun faced a critical juncture. The new Israeli government under David Ben-Gurion demanded that all armed groups be absorbed into the unified Israel Defense Forces (IDF)[^31]. The Altalena Affair in June 1948—when Ben-Gurion ordered fire on an Irgun weapons ship, killing 16 Irgun members—brought Israel to the brink of civil war[^32]. Begin, however, chose restraint, ordering his forces not to return fire against fellow Jews, a decision that likely saved the nascent state from fratricidal conflict while earning him grudging respect even from his adversaries.

Following the Irgun's dissolution, Begin transformed from underground fighter to democratic politician, founding the Herut ("Freedom") Party in 1948[^33]. For the next 29 years, he led the opposition in the Knesset, repeatedly losing elections to Ben-Gurion's Labor movement but building a loyal base among Mizrahi Jews, working-class Israelis, and ideological supporters of Greater Israel[^34]. In 1973, Begin unified several right-wing parties into the Likud coalition, creating a formidable political force[^35]. His moment finally arrived in the 1977 elections when Likud achieved a stunning upset victory, ending nearly three decades of Labor dominance in what Israelis call "The Upheaval" (HaMahapakh)[^36].

## Major Achievements

Menachem Begin's tenure as Prime Minister from 1977 to 1983 was marked by dramatic achievements that reshaped Israel's international standing, domestic society, and strategic position in the Middle East, even as they remained controversial and contested.

**The Camp David Accords and Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty**

Begin's most celebrated achievement was negotiating peace with Egypt, Israel's most powerful Arab neighbor and former adversary in multiple wars[^37]. In November 1977, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat made his historic visit to Jerusalem, addressing the Knesset in a moment that electrified the world[^38]. Begin seized this unprecedented opportunity, entering into intensive negotiations facilitated by U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Camp David in September 1978[^39].

The Camp David Accords, signed on September 17, 1978, established a framework for peace between Egypt and Israel and addressed the broader Palestinian question[^40]. Begin, assisted by Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, agreed to full Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula, including the dismantling of settlements and military installations that had existed there since 1967[^41]. This concession was extraordinary for Begin, whose ideology had emphasized the sanctity of Jewish claims to all biblical lands, yet he demonstrated pragmatic flexibility when presented with the opportunity for genuine peace.

The subsequent Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, signed in March 1979, was the first peace agreement between Israel and an Arab state, fundamentally altering Middle Eastern geopolitics[^42]. Egypt formally recognized Israel's right to exist, established diplomatic relations, and committed to peaceful coexistence[^43]. For their efforts, Begin and Sadat jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978[^44]. The Nobel committee honored them "for jointly having negotiated peace between Egypt and Israel in 1978," recognizing the courage required for both leaders to overcome decades of enmity[^45].

**Domestic and Economic Reforms**

Begin's government implemented significant domestic reforms that particularly benefited Israel's economically disadvantaged communities. He invested national resources in development programs for Israel's poorer neighborhoods, many of which housed Mizrahi Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries who had long felt marginalized by the Ashkenazi-dominated Labor establishment[^46]. This focus on social welfare for overlooked populations solidified Begin's base among working-class Israelis and transformed Israeli politics by giving voice to communities that had previously felt excluded.

Begin also sought to liberalize Israel's economy, moving away from the socialist-oriented policies that had dominated since the state's founding[^47]. While these reforms were not without controversy and economic challenges, they represented an important shift toward market-oriented economics that would accelerate in subsequent decades.

**Operation Opera: The Iraqi Nuclear Reactor**

On June 7, 1981, Begin authorized one of the most controversial yet strategically consequential military operations in Israeli history: the bombing of Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor near Baghdad[^48]. Israeli intelligence had concluded that Saddam Hussein's regime was developing nuclear weapons capability, posing an existential threat to Israel[^49]. Eight Israeli F-16 fighters, escorted by F-15s, flew across hostile territory to destroy the facility in a precision strike known as Operation Opera (or Operation Babylon)[^50].

The international community, including the United States, roundly condemned Israel's action, and the UN Security Council unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the strike[^51]. Begin, however, remained unapologetic, articulating what became known as the "Begin Doctrine"—that Israel would never permit any hostile state in the region to acquire weapons of mass destruction[^52]. A decade later, during the 1991 Gulf War, it became apparent that Israel's action had succeeded in preventing Saddam Hussein from possessing nuclear weapons during his invasion of Kuwait, vindicating Begin's controversial decision in the eyes of many strategic analysts[^53].

**Operation Moses and Ethiopian Jewry**

Begin initiated the movement to save Ethiopian Jewry, a humanitarian effort that demonstrated his commitment to gathering Jews from the diaspora[^54]. This initiative laid the groundwork for Operation Moses in 1984 and culminated in Operation Solomon in 1991, which airlifted thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel, rescuing them from famine, civil war, and persecution[^55]. This effort reflected Begin's deep connection to Jewish suffering and his determination to provide refuge for endangered Jewish communities worldwide.

**Settlements and Greater Israel**

Begin significantly expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, viewing these territories as integral parts of the biblical Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael)[^56]. He encouraged Jewish civilian settlement in these areas, a policy that remains one of the most contentious aspects of his legacy and continues to complicate Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts decades later[^57].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Menachem Begin's political career was shadowed by profound controversies that continue to generate intense debate among historians, political analysts, and the public. His critics view him as a militant extremist whose actions caused unnecessary suffering, while his defenders argue that he employed necessary resistance against oppression and later demonstrated the courage to make peace.

**The Irgun Years: Terrorism or Freedom Fighting?**

The British government classified the Irgun as a terrorist organization during the Mandate period due to their attacks on British military and civilian targets[^58]. Begin's defenders argue that the Irgun carefully distinguished between military targets and civilians and that the British colonial administration was a legitimate target for resistance[^59]. His critics counter that operations like the King David Hotel bombing, which killed 91 people, constituted terrorism regardless of warnings allegedly provided[^60].

The most controversial Irgun operation was the assault on the Arab village of Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948, carried out jointly with the Lehi organization[^61]. More than a hundred Arab villagers were killed in what became known as the Deir Yassin massacre, though Irgun and Lehi sources denied that a massacre occurred[^62]. According to multiple sources, "Menachem Begin never regretted the massacre, nor apologized for it," a stance that continues to outrage Palestinian advocates and many critics of Israeli policy[^63]. The incident created fear among Palestinian communities and contributed to the refugee crisis of 1948, known to Palestinians as the Nakba (catastrophe)[^64].

Historical debate persists about the nature of these operations. Some scholars argue that Begin's Irgun engaged in legitimate anti-colonial resistance against British imperialism, while others contend that attacks targeting civilians or creating civilian panic constitute terrorism regardless of the political context[^65]. This debate reflects broader questions about political violence, resistance movements, and the definition of terrorism that remain unresolved in international law and political discourse[^66].

**The 1982 Lebanon War**

Begin's most catastrophic decision as Prime Minister was approving Defense Minister Ariel Sharon's plan for the invasion of Lebanon in June 1982, initially termed "Operation Peace for Galilee"[^67]. The stated objective was to remove PLO forces from southern Lebanon and establish a 40-kilometer security zone to protect northern Israel from rocket attacks[^68]. However, the operation quickly exceeded its stated objectives as Israeli forces advanced to Beirut and became entangled in Lebanon's complex civil war.

The war resulted in significant Israeli and Lebanese casualties and failed to achieve lasting security benefits for Israel. Most controversially, in September 1982, following the assassination of Lebanese President-elect Bashir Gemayel, Christian Phalangist militia forces entered the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut and massacred hundreds of Palestinian and Lebanese Shiite civilians over approximately 48 hours while Israeli forces controlled the surrounding area[^69].

The massacre sparked massive protests in Israel, with an estimated 400,000 Israelis (nearly 10% of the population) demonstrating in Tel Aviv demanding accountability[^70]. The Israeli government established the Kahan Commission to investigate the events[^71]. The commission found that while Israeli forces did not directly perpetrate the killings, Israeli officials bore indirect responsibility for failing to prevent the massacre[^72]. Defense Minister Ariel Sharon was found to bear "personal responsibility" and was forced to resign from his position, though he remained in the cabinet[^73].

The Lebanon War and the Sabra and Shatila massacre severely damaged Begin's reputation both internationally and domestically. Israel's continuing involvement in Lebanon became increasingly costly and unpopular, contributing to Begin's eventual resignation[^74].

**Treatment of Palestinians and the Question of Greater Israel**

Begin's ideology of Greater Israel—the belief that the entire Land of Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza, belonged to the Jewish people—led to policies that critics argue violated Palestinian rights and international law[^75]. His expansion of settlements in occupied territories created "facts on the ground" that have complicated peace negotiations for decades[^76]. Palestinian advocates and many international observers view these policies as colonial expansion and a major obstacle to Palestinian self-determination[^77].

**Democratic Controversies**

While Begin is often praised for his respect for democratic institutions and the rule of law, critics point to authoritarian tendencies, including attempts to suppress dissent during the Lebanon War and hostile rhetoric toward political opponents[^78]. His longtime rival David Ben-Gurion famously called him a fascist, reflecting the intensity of ideological divisions in Israeli politics[^79].

## Personal Life

Menachem Begin's personal life was marked by deep devotion to his family, particularly his wife Aliza, and by the profound scars left by the Holocaust, which claimed most of his family and shaped his worldview throughout his political career.

Begin married Aliza Arnold in May 1939 in Poland, just months before World War II engulfed Europe[^80]. Their marriage would last 43 years until Aliza's death in 1982, characterized by unwavering mutual devotion through extraordinarily difficult circumstances[^81]. Aliza supported Menachem through his years in the Soviet Gulag, his time as an underground leader hunted by the British, and his decades in opposition politics before finally sharing in his triumph as Prime Minister[^82].

The couple had three children: Benny Begin, who became a scientist and Likud politician serving in various ministerial positions; Leah Begin; and Hassia Begin[^83]. Despite the demands of underground leadership and later political life, Begin was known as a devoted father who maintained close relationships with his children throughout his life[^84].

Begin's personality combined passionate oratory with personal modesty and formal manners. He was known for his eloquent, passionate speaking style that drew heavily on Jewish history, biblical references, and collective memory of persecution[^85]. Unlike many politicians, he lived modestly and was regarded as personally honest and incorruptible, never using his position for personal enrichment[^86]. His formal, almost old-fashioned courtesy contrasted sharply with the rough-and-tumble sabra political culture that dominated Israeli politics[^87].

The Holocaust cast an immense shadow over Begin's life and political philosophy. His parents, brother, and much of his extended family perished in the Nazi genocide[^88]. Begin's mother and father were killed when the Nazis liquidated the Brest ghetto[^89]. This profound loss infused Begin's rhetoric with references to Jewish suffering and the imperative of Jewish strength and sovereignty to prevent future catastrophes[^90]. Critics sometimes argued that Begin exploited Holocaust memory for political purposes, while supporters maintained that his invocation of historical trauma reflected genuine conviction about the existential threats facing the Jewish people[^91].

Begin suffered from depression and various health problems throughout his later years. The death of Aliza in November 1982 devastated him profoundly[^92]. Many historians identify her death, combined with the mounting casualties and criticism of the Lebanon War, as crucial factors in his decision to resign as Prime Minister in October 1983[^93]. Following his resignation, Begin withdrew almost completely from public life, spending his remaining years in seclusion in an apartment overlooking the Jerusalem Forest[^94]. He rarely granted interviews or made public appearances, suffering from clinical depression and deteriorating health until his death on March 9, 1992[^95].

Begin's funeral was attended by thousands of Israelis who mourned the passing of a man who had led them from underground resistance to international recognition, from militant opposition to historic peacemaking[^96]. He was buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem, his gravestone bearing testament to a life of struggle, conviction, and paradox[^97].

## Legacy

Menachem Begin's legacy remains deeply contested, reflecting the polarized nature of Israeli politics and the unresolved debates about Zionism, Palestinian rights, peace, and security that continue to shape Middle Eastern politics decades after his death.

**Transformation of Israeli Politics**

Begin fundamentally transformed Israeli political culture by breaking the Labor Party's hegemony and bringing the Likud to power in 1977[^98]. This "Upheaval" (HaMahapakh) represented not just a change of government but a social revolution that gave political voice to Mizrahi Jews and working-class Israelis who felt marginalized by the Ashkenazi Labor establishment[^99]. This realignment continues to define Israeli politics, with the right-wing bloc that Begin built remaining dominant for most of the period since 1977[^100].

**The Peace Precedent**

Begin established the precedent that Israel would exchange land for peace with Arab states willing to recognize its existence and enter into genuine peace agreements[^101]. The Egypt-Israel treaty has endured for more than four decades, surviving regional upheavals, changes of government, and the Arab Spring[^102]. This achievement demonstrated that peace between Israel and Arab states was possible, providing a model for subsequent Israeli-Jordanian peace and ongoing normalization efforts with other Arab countries[^103].

However, Begin's simultaneous commitment to Greater Israel—retaining the West Bank and Gaza Strip while making peace with Egypt—created a paradox that continues to haunt Israeli policy[^104]. By distinguishing between peace with sovereign states (possible) and territorial concessions in the Palestinian territories (unacceptable), Begin established a framework that has complicated comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace[^105].

**The Holocaust and Jewish Memory**

Begin's constant invocation of the Holocaust and Jewish historical suffering influenced how Israel understood its security challenges and international position[^106]. His rhetoric emphasized the Jewish people's solitude in a hostile world and the imperative of military strength to prevent another catastrophe[^107]. Critics argue this mindset fostered excessive militarism and unwillingness to take risks for peace, while supporters contend it reflected realistic assessment of persistent threats to Jewish existence[^108].

**Respect for Democracy and the Rule of Law**

Despite his militant past and ideological intensity, Begin is widely credited with scrupulous respect for democratic institutions, judicial independence, and the rule of law[^109]. When he disagreed with court decisions, he complied; when he lost elections, he accepted the results; when his policies faced massive public opposition (as during the Lebanon War), he ultimately bowed to public pressure[^110]. In an era when democracy faces challenges globally and in the Middle East particularly, Begin's democratic commitments remain a significant part of his legacy[^111].

**Settlement Expansion and the Occupation**

Begin's active promotion of settlement construction in the West Bank and Gaza Strip created enduring obstacles to peace and transformed the demographic and political landscape[^112]. What began under his leadership has expanded into a settlement enterprise housing hundreds of thousands of Israelis in territories beyond the Green Line, creating what critics call an apartheid system and what supporters view as legitimate expression of Jewish historical rights[^113]. This aspect of his legacy remains perhaps the most contentious in assessing his historical impact.

**Military Doctrine**

The Begin Doctrine—that Israel will not permit any hostile state in the region to acquire weapons of mass destruction—has shaped Israeli military strategy for decades[^114]. Subsequent Israeli actions, including the 2007 strike on Syria's Al-Kibar reactor and ongoing operations against Iranian nuclear facilities, reflect the precedent Begin established with the Osirak bombing[^115].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Menachem Begin emphasize his transformation from underground fighter to peacemaker, his democratic principles, his championship of marginalized communities within Israeli society, and his unwavering commitment to Jewish dignity and survival.

Daniel Gordis, in his biography "Menachem Begin: The Battle for Israel's Soul," argues that Begin embodied the best of Jewish tradition—commitment to justice, respect for law, and willingness to take risks for peace while never compromising on core principles of Jewish security[^116]. Gordis suggests that Begin's complex legacy offers lessons for contemporary Israeli politics, particularly his ability to combine ideological conviction with pragmatic flexibility[^117].

Supporters emphasize that Begin's Irgun activities must be understood in the context of legitimate anti-colonial resistance against British imperialism, which had reneged on promises to facilitate Jewish statehood while limiting Jewish immigration even as the Holocaust raged in Europe[^118]. They argue that the Irgun targeted military and administrative installations, not civilian populations, and that warnings were typically provided before attacks[^119].

The liberal Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz, despite political distance from Begin's ideology, has highlighted his respect for the judicial system and democratic institutions, contrasting favorably with some subsequent Israeli leaders[^120]. Religious communities emphasize his connection to Jewish tradition and his role in strengthening Jewish education and identity[^121]. Conservative commentators stress his devotion to the whole Land of Israel and his refusal to compromise on Jewish historical rights[^122].

Begin's Nobel Peace Prize and the enduring Egypt-Israel peace treaty stand as tangible achievements that have saved countless lives and provided regional stability for over four decades[^123]. Scholars note the courage required for a leader of Begin's ideological background to make such dramatic territorial concessions, dismantling settlements and withdrawing from the entire Sinai Peninsula[^124].

His defenders argue that Begin understood himself and his country to be "links in the chain of Jewish history," connecting contemporary Israel to millennia of Jewish struggle for survival, dignity, and sovereignty[^125]. This historical consciousness, they contend, provided moral grounding and long-term perspective often lacking in short-term political calculations[^126].

### Negative Views

Critics of Menachem Begin focus on his role in operations that killed civilians, his promotion of settlements that have obstructed peace, his responsibility for the Lebanon War catastrophe, and his contribution to Israeli militarism and unwillingness to recognize Palestinian rights.

Palestinian historians and advocates view Begin as a terrorist whose Irgun killed Arab civilians, created fear that contributed to the 1948 refugee crisis, and never showed remorse for these actions[^127]. The Deir Yassin massacre remains particularly contentious, with Begin's refusal to apologize seen as demonstrating moral blindness to Palestinian suffering[^128].

Critics argue that Begin's ideology of Greater Israel and promotion of settlements established colonial structures that have denied Palestinian self-determination and violated international law[^129]. They contend that while Begin made peace with Egypt, he did so precisely to free Israel to consolidate control over the West Bank and Gaza without facing a united Arab military front[^130].

The 1982 Lebanon War and the Sabra and Shatila massacre represent for critics the catastrophic consequences of Begin's militaristic worldview and ideological rigidity[^131]. The war achieved none of its stated objectives, cost hundreds of Israeli lives, killed thousands of Lebanese and Palestinians, and damaged Israel's international standing[^132]. Begin's indirect responsibility for Sabra and Shatila, established by the Kahan Commission, demonstrates moral failure in critics' assessment[^133].

Some historians argue that Begin's constant invocation of the Holocaust and Jewish persecution fostered a siege mentality that prevented empathy for Palestinian suffering and realistic assessment of security threats[^134]. They contend this rhetoric contributed to excessive militarism and unwillingness to take calculated risks for comprehensive peace[^135].

David Ben-Gurion's characterization of Begin as having "fascist" tendencies, while inflammatory, reflected genuine concern among Labor Zionists that Begin's nationalism, militant rhetoric, and mass mobilization tactics threatened liberal democratic values[^136]. While Begin ultimately governed democratically, critics point to authoritarian impulses and extreme nationalism that occasionally surfaced in his rhetoric and policies[^137].

International human rights organizations have criticized Begin's policies toward Palestinians, including settlement expansion, harsh military rule in occupied territories, and collective punishment measures that violated international humanitarian law[^138]. They argue that Begin's legacy includes the structural foundations of occupation and apartheid-like conditions that persist today[^139].
