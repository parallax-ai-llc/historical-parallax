## Summary

Shi Kefa (史可法; 1601-1645) was a distinguished government official, military commander, and calligrapher during the late Ming Dynasty and early Southern Ming period. Born in Kaifeng, Henan Province, he achieved the highest level of imperial examination success (jinshi degree) in 1628 and served in various administrative and military positions. He is best remembered for his unwavering loyalty to the Ming Dynasty and his heroic defense of Yangzhou against Qing forces in 1645, which ended in his martyrdom. His refusal to surrender to the Manchu invaders made him an enduring symbol of patriotism and righteous resistance in Chinese history.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Shi Kefa was born on February 4, 1601, in Xiangfu (祥符), present-day Kaifeng, Henan Province, though he claimed ancestral origins from Daxing County, Shuntian Prefecture (順天府大興縣), in what is now Beijing.[^3][^4] His courtesy names were Xianzhi (憲之) and Daolin (道鄰), reflecting the scholarly traditions of late Ming literati culture. Born into a family with aspirations for government service, Shi Kefa pursued the traditional path of classical education that prepared candidates for the imperial civil service examinations.

The young Shi Kefa demonstrated exceptional scholarly aptitude and came under the mentorship of Zuo Guangdou (左光斗), a prominent member of the Donglin movement (東林黨), a reform-minded faction of scholar-officials who advocated for moral governance and opposed eunuch corruption at court.[^5][^6] This relationship would profoundly influence Shi Kefa's political philosophy and career trajectory. The Donglin faction, which had established an academy that became deeply involved in factional politics during the late Ming, emphasized Confucian principles of loyalty, righteousness, and moral governance.[^7]

Shi Kefa's devotion to his mentor was demonstrated dramatically when Zuo Guangdou was imprisoned and tortured by the powerful eunuch Wei Zhongxian during the reign of the Tianqi Emperor. Shi Kefa courageously sneaked into the prison to visit his master, later reporting that Zuo "was no longer in human form."[^8] This early experience of witnessing his mentor's suffering for political principles would shape Shi Kefa's own unwavering commitment to loyalty and righteousness. In 1628, Shi Kefa successfully obtained his jinshi (進士) degree, the highest level of achievement in the Chinese civil service examination system, opening the door to official service in the imperial bureaucracy.[^9][^10]

---

## Rise to Power

Following his examination success in 1628, Shi Kefa embarked on a distinguished career in the Ming bureaucracy. He was initially appointed as an official in Xi'an, before subsequently serving as a yuanwailang (員外郎, supernumerary director) and langzhong (郎中, bureau director) in the Ministry of Revenue, positions that gave him valuable administrative experience in fiscal management.[^11] These early appointments provided Shi Kefa with insight into the financial challenges facing the late Ming state, which was struggling with military expenses, peasant rebellions, and Manchu incursions.

In 1635, Shi Kefa's career took a more military direction when he joined General Lu Xiangsheng (盧象昇) in campaigns to suppress the widespread peasant revolts that were destabilizing Ming authority throughout the empire.[^12] This experience in counter-insurgency operations gave Shi Kefa firsthand knowledge of the internal threats facing the dynasty. Two years later, in 1637, his competence was recognized when Minister Zhang Guowei (張國維) recommended his promotion to yushi (御史, censor), a prestigious position responsible for monitoring official conduct and advising the emperor.[^13]

Along with this promotion, Shi Kefa was appointed as xunfu (巡撫, provincial governor) with jurisdiction over Anqing, Luzhou (present-day Hefei), Taiping (near present-day Wuhu), Chizhou (池州), and various counties spanning Henan, Jiangxi, and Huguang provinces.[^14] This regional governorship placed him in a strategic position overseeing vital territories in central China. By the seventh month of 1643, as the Ming Dynasty faced mounting crises from both internal rebellion and external invasion, Shi Kefa was appointed Minister of War in Nanjing, one of the empire's most important cities and the southern capital.[^15] This position would place him at the center of events following the catastrophic fall of Beijing in 1644.

## Major Achievements

### Establishment of the Southern Ming

Shi Kefa's most significant political achievement came in the immediate aftermath of the Chongzhen Emperor's suicide on April 25, 1644, following the rebel forces' capture of Beijing. As Ming loyalists fled south, Shi Kefa played a crucial role in establishing continuity of the Ming Dynasty through the Southern Ming government. Together with Fengyang Governor-General Ma Shiying (馬士英), Shi Kefa agreed to form a loyalist Ming government centered on the Prince of Fu, Zhu Yousong.[^16][^17] On June 19, 1644, Zhu Yousong was proclaimed emperor with the reign title Hongguang, marking the beginning of the Southern Ming's resistance against both the Qing invaders and rebel forces.[^18]

As a leading official in the new Hongguang regime, Shi Kefa represented the pro-Donglin faction, which emphasized moral governance and principled resistance. His involvement in establishing the Southern Ming demonstrated his commitment to dynastic legitimacy and Confucian principles of loyalty to one's sovereign. However, Shi Kefa's influence in the court was soon undermined by political rivals, particularly Ma Shiying, who had gained the Hongguang Emperor's favor by escorting him to Nanjing and rallying military support.[^19]

### Defense of the Northern Frontier

After losing influence in the imperial court to Ma Shiying's faction, Shi Kefa requested to be dispatched north to organize defenses against the advancing Qing forces.[^20] He was given command of the strategic region north of the Yangtze River, with responsibility for defending the approaches to Nanjing. This assignment removed him from court politics but placed him in the critical military position of defending the Southern Ming's northern frontier. Shi Kefa worked to coordinate various Ming commanders and fortify key cities, including Yangzhou, which controlled access to the Grand Canal and served as a crucial gateway to the Yangtze Delta region.

### Cultural Accomplishments

Beyond his political and military roles, Shi Kefa was also recognized as a skilled calligrapher, excelling in cursive and semi-cursive styles.[^21] His calligraphic works, including pieces dated to 1620, 1632, 1635, and 1643, demonstrate his cultivation of traditional Chinese literati arts.[^22] One of his calligraphy pieces from 1635, created in ink on paper, is held in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, with distinguished provenance through the Weng family collection.[^23] His descendants later collected his writings and compiled them into "Lord Shi Zhongzheng's Collections" (史忠正公集), preserving his literary and administrative correspondence for posterity.[^24]

### The Response to Dorgon

Among Shi Kefa's most celebrated writings was his response to a letter from Dorgon (多爾袞), the Qing regent, who had written asking for Shi Kefa's surrender. Dorgon's letter invoked Confucian principles, arguing that the rebel Li Zicheng had murdered the Ming emperor and humiliated the dynasty's ancestors, and that the Qing were simply avenging this wrong. He questioned why Shi Kefa was "clinging to an illusion of peace" and offered that if Shi surrendered and removed the "fake emperor," the Qing would treat him as an honored guest and make him a noble.[^25] Shi Kefa declined, and his response, titled "Reply to Dorgon's Letter" (復多爾袞書), was noted for its "neither servile nor overbearing tone," demonstrating dignified resistance without arrogant defiance.[^26][^27] This letter became widely circulated among later generations as an exemplar of principled loyalty and moral integrity in the face of overwhelming pressure.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Strategic Misjudgments

Despite his reputation for loyalty, Shi Kefa's strategic and political decisions have been subject to criticism by historians. One significant error was his advocacy of a policy to "ally with the Qing to eliminate the rebels first, then drive the Qing forces back north."[^28] This strategy fundamentally misunderstood the Qing Dynasty's territorial ambitions and military capabilities. The Manchu forces had no intention of merely serving as auxiliaries against Chinese rebels; they sought to conquer China entirely. This miscalculation may have contributed to inadequate defensive preparations against the primary threat.

### Political Indecisiveness

Shi Kefa's inability to decisively influence the succession crisis following the Chongzhen Emperor's death revealed political weaknesses. Though he was effectively the leader of Ming loyalists in Nanjing, he could not make a firm decision on which prince should succeed as emperor.[^29] This indecisiveness allowed Ma Shiying to gain the upper hand by decisively backing the Prince of Fu and physically escorting him to Nanjing. The resulting power shift marginalized Shi Kefa from the center of government at a critical moment when unified leadership was essential.

### Factional Politics

Shi Kefa's association with the Donglin faction, while grounded in principled Confucian governance ideals, contributed to debilitating factional conflicts within the Southern Ming government. The Hongguang regime was plagued from its inception by political struggles between the pro-Donglin party (including Shi Kefa) and the faction formerly aligned with the eunuch Wei Zhongxian (including Ma Shiying).[^30] Rather than uniting against external threats, court officials pursued factional interests, undermining the regime's military effectiveness and political legitimacy.

### Inadequate Military Coordination

During the defense of Yangzhou, Shi Kefa faced critical shortages of reinforcements that might have been avoided with better political relationships. When he sent messengers requesting military support, his subordinate Liu Zeqing (劉澤清) fled north to Huai'an rather than coming to his aid, and only Liu Zhaoji (劉肇基) responded to the call.[^31] This lack of coordinated military response reflected both Ma Shiying's diversion of forces to deal with other threats and Shi Kefa's limited authority over regional commanders. Ma Shiying considered the rebellion of Ming general Zuo Liangyu a greater threat and ordered several commanders north of the Yangtze to halt Zuo's advance, thereby fatally weakening Shi Kefa's defensive position at Yangzhou.[^32]

### Moral Criticism of the Defense

Some historical analyses have questioned whether Shi Kefa's determination to defend Yangzhou to the death, while embodying personal loyalty and integrity, served the broader interests of the population he was sworn to protect. His refusal to negotiate terms of surrender led directly to the horrific Yangzhou Massacre, in which Prince Dodo ordered his troops to slaughter the city's inhabitants for ten days as punishment for the resistance.[^33] In his final days, Shi Kefa himself agonized over his failures, writing sorrowful letters to his family.[^34] The moral complexity of choosing honor over the lives of tens of thousands who "lacked the power to choose" presents a troubling dimension to his martyrdom.[^35]

---

## Personal Life

Specific details about Shi Kefa's immediate family, including the names of his wife and children, are not extensively documented in surviving historical sources. However, it is known that he had descendants who survived him, as they later collected his writings and compiled them into the comprehensive collection known as "Lord Shi Zhongzheng's Collections."[^36] This compilation work suggests that his family maintained both literacy and reverence for their ancestor's legacy despite the dynastic transition.

Shi Kefa also adopted a godson named Shi Dewei (史德威), to whom he entrusted his funeral arrangements during the siege of Yangzhou. Shi Kefa expressed his wish to be buried at Plum Blossom Ridge (Meihua Ridge) outside Yangzhou after his death.[^37] In the desperate final moments as the city walls were breached, when Shi Kefa attempted suicide by slitting his throat but failed, he ordered his godson to kill him to prevent capture. When Shi Dewei refused, Shi Kefa shouted, "I'm Military Inspector Shi. Quickly kill me!"[^38] This account demonstrates the close relationship between Shi Kefa and his adopted son, as well as Shi Dewei's loyalty in refusing to personally end his father's life despite the dire circumstances.

### Character and Temperament

Contemporary accounts and his own writings reveal Shi Kefa as a man of unwavering principles, extraordinary courage, and genuine compassion. His character was profoundly shaped by Confucian values of loyalty (忠, zhong) and righteousness (義, yi), which he exemplified throughout his life and particularly in his final stand. When faced with certain death, Shi Kefa demonstrated remarkable composure and clarity of purpose. His famous declaration to Prince Dodo captures his resolution: "I fall together with the city. My decision will not change. Even if I'm torn to pieces, my feelings will be as sweet as maltose."[^39]

Yet even in facing his own death, Shi Kefa's concern extended beyond personal honor to the welfare of others. He pleaded with the Qing commanders: "Do not harm the thousands of lives in Yangzhou!"[^40] This demonstrated a compassionate dimension to his character that transcended the personal glory often associated with martyrdom. His letters from the final days reveal a man torn between duty to his principles and anguish over the consequences his choices would bring to others.[^41]

The posthumous names granted to Shi Kefa by both the Southern Ming and later the Qing Dynasty reflect how his character was perceived across political boundaries. The Southern Ming honored him with the posthumous name "Zhongjing" (忠靖), meaning "loyal and peaceful," while nearly a century later, the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing granted him another posthumous name, "Zhongzheng" (忠正), meaning "loyal and upright."[^42][^43] These honors from both the dynasty he died defending and the dynasty that conquered it demonstrate the transcendent quality of his character that commanded respect even from his former enemies.

## Legacy

### Physical Memorials

The most tangible expression of Shi Kefa's enduring legacy is the Shi Kefa Memorial Hall in Yangzhou, originally constructed in the second year of the Shunzhi era (1645), rebuilt during the Qianlong period, and again renovated in the ninth year of Tongzhi.[^44] Located at 24 Guangchumenwai Street in the Hanjiang District, the memorial complex centers on a cenotaph, as Shi Kefa's actual remains were never recovered following the massacre.[^45] Twelve days after his execution, his body could not be found among the carnage.[^46] His godson Shi Dewei later fulfilled his wishes by burying his headdress and garments at Plum Blossom Ridge outside the Tianning Gate of Yangzhou in 1646, creating a clothing tomb that became the heart of the memorial complex.[^47][^48]

The memorial features a dry lacquer statue of Shi Kefa built in 1985 to commemorate the 340th anniversary of his martyrdom.[^49] Over three centuries, countless scholars and poets have made pilgrimages to the shrine, leaving behind poems and tributes, many engraved on stone tablets adorning the walls.[^50] The Shi Kefa Ancestral Tomb, also known as the Shi Kefa Memorial, was formally established in 1768.[^51] Today, the memorial continues to serve as a place of reflection, with free admission allowing visitors to honor "righteous ancestors" in a peaceful park covering over half a mountain.[^52]

### Literary and Political Significance

Shi Kefa's writings, particularly his "Reply to Dorgon's Letter," achieved lasting literary and political significance. The letter circulated among later generations as a masterpiece of dignified resistance, demonstrating how to maintain moral authority while refusing submission without resorting to empty bravado.[^53] His collected works, compiled by his descendants into "Lord Shi Zhongzheng's Collections," preserved not only his official correspondence and policy writings but also personal letters that revealed his inner struggles during the Southern Ming's final crisis.[^54]

### Symbol of Resistance and Nationalism

Shi Kefa's martyrdom took on renewed political significance during periods of Chinese nationalism, particularly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Wang Xiuchu's eyewitness account of the Yangzhou Massacre, "A Record of Ten Days in Yangzhou" (揚州十日記), had been suppressed during Qing rule as official historiography minimized or omitted references to Qing atrocities during the conquest.[^55] However, manuscripts circulated clandestinely among literati throughout the Qing Dynasty.[^56] At the turn of the 20th century, reformers such as Liang Qichao reprinted the account in tens of thousands of copies, widely circulating it to stir up anti-Manchu sentiment as revolutionary movements sought to overthrow the Qing Dynasty.[^57] In this context, Shi Kefa became a powerful symbol of Han Chinese resistance to foreign conquest, his loyalty reinterpreted through nationalist frameworks.

### Reconciliation and Universal Recognition

The Qianlong Emperor's decision to grant Shi Kefa the posthumous name "Zhongzheng" (loyal and upright) nearly a century after his death represented a remarkable act of reconciliation by the Qing Dynasty.[^58] By honoring a man who had died resisting Qing conquest, the Qianlong Emperor acknowledged that loyalty itself—even loyalty to a defeated dynasty—deserved respect. This gesture reflected Confucian values that transcended political boundaries, recognizing that Shi Kefa's unwavering commitment to his principles embodied the very virtues that sustained Chinese civilization regardless of which dynasty held power. This dual commemoration by both the dynasty he served and the dynasty he opposed made Shi Kefa a unique figure in Chinese history, claimed by both sides as exemplifying the highest moral standards.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessment of Shi Kefa has overwhelmingly emphasized his role as a paragon of Confucian virtue, particularly the principle of loyalty (忠, zhong) that stood at the center of traditional Chinese political philosophy. His willingness to die rather than abandon the Ming Dynasty, despite knowing that resistance was militarily futile, embodied the Confucian ideal that moral principles must be upheld regardless of practical consequences. As Lynn Struve noted in her influential work "Voices from the Ming-Qing Cataclysm," which includes substantial treatment of Shi Kefa's role, his actions during this transitional period represent one of the most dramatic examples of principled resistance in Chinese history.[^59]

The fact that even the conquering Qing Dynasty eventually honored Shi Kefa speaks to the universal recognition of his character. The Qianlong Emperor's bestowal of the posthumous name "Zhongzheng" (loyal and upright) demonstrated that the Qing court, once firmly established, could afford to honor those who had opposed them, recognizing that Shi Kefa's loyalty to the Ming actually reinforced rather than threatened the Confucian political order that the Qing themselves claimed to uphold.[^60] This suggests that traditional Chinese political culture valued the principle of loyalty itself more than the specific object of that loyalty.

Modern Chinese scholarship, while increasingly diverse in its methodologies, has continued to view Shi Kefa as an important historical figure, particularly in studies of the Ming-Qing transition. His story appears in curricula examining this pivotal period of Chinese history, indicating his continued relevance to understanding how Chinese intellectuals and officials navigated periods of dynastic collapse and foreign conquest.[^61] The memorial in Yangzhou remains a popular destination, suggesting that Shi Kefa's legacy continues to resonate with contemporary Chinese audiences who value his integrity and self-sacrifice.[^62]

### Negative Views

Critical historical assessments of Shi Kefa have focused on several dimensions of his actions and their consequences. From a purely military and strategic perspective, Shi Kefa's defense of Yangzhou can be viewed as a catastrophic failure that resulted in one of the bloodiest massacres in Chinese history. His policy of initially proposing to ally with the Qing against the rebels demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of geopolitical realities, suggesting limitations in his strategic thinking.[^63] A more pragmatic leader might have recognized the futility of resistance and negotiated terms that could have spared the city's population.

The political dimension of criticism focuses on how factional conflicts undermined the Southern Ming's chances of survival. Shi Kefa's association with the Donglin faction and his inability to work effectively with Ma Shiying contributed to the disunity that plagued the Hongguang regime.[^64] Rather than subordinating factional loyalty to the greater cause of Ming restoration, Shi Kefa and his allies continued political struggles that diverted attention and resources from military defense. His indecisiveness during the succession crisis revealed political weaknesses that allowed less principled but more decisive figures like Ma Shiying to gain power.[^65]

The moral criticism of Shi Kefa's final stand presents perhaps the most challenging assessment. While his personal courage and loyalty are undeniable, the practical result was the Yangzhou Massacre, in which somewhere between tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed by Qing forces enraged by the resistance.[^66] Wang Xiuchu's eyewitness account, "A Record of Ten Days in Yangzhou," documented the horrific atrocities committed against people who had no choice in whether the city would resist.[^67] Some scholars have questioned whether Shi Kefa's determination to fulfill his personal moral obligations justified the consequences for the population he was ostensibly protecting. His own letters from the final days show he agonized over these very questions, suggesting an awareness that his principled stand came at a terrible cost to others.[^68]

From a perspective that privileges human welfare over abstract principles, Shi Kefa's choice can be seen as prioritizing his personal honor and the honor of the scholar-official class over the lives of ordinary people. The massacre that followed Yangzhou's fall was not an unforeseeable accident but a predictable consequence of prolonged resistance that inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking army. Prince Dodo's rage at the losses his forces sustained directly motivated his order to massacre the city's inhabitants.[^69] A utilitarian ethical framework would judge Shi Kefa's actions as profoundly wrong, regardless of the nobility of his personal motivations.
