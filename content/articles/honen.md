## Summary

Honen was a Japanese Buddhist monk who founded the Jodo-shu (Pure Land) school, the first independent Pure Land school in Japan. He taught that in the degenerate age of Dharma (mappo), the only effective practice was nembutsu — calling on the name of Amida Buddha. His emphasis on salvation through faith rather than monastic discipline made Buddhism accessible to ordinary people. His revolutionary teachings led to his exile by the established Buddhist authorities.
