## Summary

Crawford Long was an American surgeon and pharmacist who was the first physician to use diethyl ether as a surgical anesthetic, performing the first painless surgery in 1842. His use of ether for the removal of a neck tumor predated William Morton's famous public demonstration by four years. However, because he did not publish his results until 1849, Morton often receives credit for the discovery.
