## Summary

Jayarashi Bhatta was an Indian philosopher who wrote the Tattvopaplavasimha (The Lion that Devours All Categories), a radical skeptical work that challenged all philosophical systems including materialism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Vedanta. His work represents the most thorough-going skepticism in Indian philosophy, arguing that no means of valid knowledge (pramana) can be established. He is sometimes associated with the Charvaka/Lokayata materialist tradition.
