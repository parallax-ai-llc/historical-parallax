## Summary

Kim Il-sung (1912-1994) was the founding leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea), serving as its supreme leader from 1948 until his death in 1994.[^1] Born Kim Song-ju, he adopted the name "Kim Il-sung" (meaning "Kim become the sun") in 1935 while fighting as an anti-Japanese guerrilla in Manchuria.[^2] Through a combination of Soviet backing, ruthless purges of political rivals, and the creation of an unprecedented personality cult, Kim transformed North Korea into one of the world's most totalitarian states.[^3] His legacy includes the Korean War, the establishment of the Juche ideology of self-reliance, a hereditary dictatorship that continues through his descendants, and a catastrophic human rights record that persists decades after his death.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Kim Il-sung was born Kim Song-ju on April 15, 1912, in the small village of Mangyongdae-guyok near Pyongyang, Korea, during the Japanese colonial occupation.[^5] His father, Kim Hyong-jik, was variously described as a liberal-minded teacher, an occasional practitioner of traditional Korean medicine, and an independence activist who opposed Japanese rule.[^6] His mother, Kang Pan-sok, came from a Presbyterian Christian family, and young Kim was raised in a devoutly Christian household—his maternal grandfather served as a Protestant minister, and his father was an elder in the Presbyterian Church who had attended a missionary school.[^7]

The Kim family's life under Japanese occupation was marked by hardship and resistance. In May 1919, when Kim was only seven years old, his father took the family into exile, fleeing to Manchuria to escape Japanese persecution.[^8] They settled in Badaogou, China, where Kim's formative years were spent among Korean expatriate communities resisting Japanese imperialism. This early experience of displacement and anti-colonial struggle would profoundly shape Kim's political consciousness and revolutionary identity.

Kim attended Whasung Military Academy in 1926 but left after only one year in 1927.[^9] He then enrolled at Yuwen Middle School in Jilin, China, where he studied until 1930. During his teenage years, Kim became increasingly involved in communist youth activities. In 1931, he joined the Chinese Communist Youth League, marking the beginning of his formal association with communist organizations.[^10] His political activism led to his first arrest—he was jailed for several months in 1929 when police discovered his underground Marxist organization.[^11]

The death of Kim's father in 1926, when Kim was just fourteen, left a lasting impression on the young revolutionary.[^12] This personal loss, combined with witnessing Japanese oppression firsthand, fueled Kim's commitment to the anti-Japanese resistance movement. His mother, Kang Pan-sok, would later be incorporated into North Korea's official mythology as the "mother of Korea," though she played a less direct role in Kim's political career.[^13] Kim also had two younger brothers, Kim Ch'ŏl-chu and Kim Yong-ju, the latter of whom would later become known as "the revolutionary fighter" within the Kim dynasty's personality cult.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Kim Il-sung's path to power began in the forests and mountains of Manchuria, where he joined various anti-Japanese guerrilla groups in northern China during the early 1930s.[^15] In 1931, after joining the Chinese Communist Party, Kim became a member of the organization committee for Fusong and Antu of the Korean Farmers' General Union in Eastern Provinces.[^16] His guerrilla career took a significant step forward in February 1936 when he joined the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, a guerrilla force established by the Chinese Communist Party.[^17]

Kim rapidly rose through the guerrilla ranks, demonstrating both military capability and leadership skills. In 1937, at the remarkably young age of 24, he was appointed commander of the 6th division, controlling a few hundred men in what became known as "Kim Il-sung's division."[^18] While historians generally accept that Kim's exploits were later exaggerated by the personality cult built around him, there is consensus that he was indeed a significant guerrilla leader who conducted effective operations against Japanese forces.[^19]

The most famous of Kim's guerrilla actions occurred on June 4, 1937, when he led approximately 200 guerrillas in a daring raid on Poch'onbo, a town just inside the Korean border.[^20] During this attack, Kim's forces destroyed local government offices, set fire to a Japanese police station and post office, and briefly occupied the town before withdrawing. The Japanese military regarded Kim as one of the most effective and popular Korean guerrilla leaders of the era.[^21] By late 1939, the Japanese had placed a 200,000 yen reward—an enormous sum—for any information leading to Kim's capture, making him the most wanted guerrilla in all of Manchuria.[^22]

However, the tide turned against the guerrillas by the late 1930s. After effective Japanese counterinsurgency campaigns that reduced guerrilla numbers from well over 200,000 in the early 1930s to just a few thousand by the mid-1930s, Kim was forced to retreat.[^23] By 1939, Japanese forces had gained the upper hand, and Kim fled from Manchuria to the Soviet Far East. He crossed into Soviet territory and settled in the area around Khabarovsk, where he received military and political training from Soviet authorities and served in the Red Army during World War II.[^24]

Kim's fortunes changed dramatically with Japan's defeat in 1945. Stalin, viewing North Korea as important to Soviet security interests in defending the Asian front, identified Kim Il-sung as a potential communist leader who could be installed to ensure Soviet control over northern Korea.[^25] Lavrenti Beria, Stalin's notorious security chief, personally selected Kim for this role.[^26] On September 19, 1945, Kim and 66 other Korean Red Army officers who had fought the Japanese in Manchuria and subsequently lived and trained in the USSR arrived in Wonsan.[^27]

On October 14, 1945, Soviet authorities formally introduced Kim to the North Korean public, presenting him as a guerrilla hero and national liberator.[^28] The Soviets provided massive military support, shipping 17,000 rifles and carbines, 5,800 machine guns, 268 mortars, and 234 artillery guns in 1946 alone to arm the newly formed Korean People's Army.[^29] Using Soviet advisers and equipment, Kim constructed a large, well-equipped army trained in infiltration tactics and guerrilla warfare.[^30]

In February 1946, the North Korean Provisional People's Committee was established with Kim Il-sung as chairman.[^31] Following elections held in the northern occupation zone on August 25, 1948, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was officially proclaimed on September 9, 1948, with Kim installed as the Soviet-designated premier.[^32]

## Major Achievements

Kim Il-sung's most significant policy achievement was the development and implementation of the Juche ideology, a philosophy of national self-reliance that became the defining principle of the North Korean state.[^33] Introduced in the mid-1950s and refined throughout his rule, Juche positioned North Korea as ideologically independent from both Soviet and Chinese communism. The ideology emphasized that "man is the master of all things and the decisive factor in everything," placing human agency and Korean national identity at the center of political, economic, and social organization.[^34] Juche became the foundation not only for North Korea's domestic policies but also for the personality cult surrounding Kim and his family, effectively rendering communist ideology and Korean nationalism subservient to absolute submission to the leader.[^35]

In the economic sphere, Kim oversaw rapid industrialization and growth during the 1950s and 1960s, a period when North Korea's economy actually outperformed South Korea's.[^36] After the devastation of the Korean War, Kim immediately launched an ambitious three-year reconstruction period followed by a five-year economic plan in 1956, modeled on Soviet five-year plans.[^37] The strategy focused heavily on heavy industry and arms production, pushing the economy forward at record growth rates.[^38] Rich in natural resources and benefiting from extensive Chinese and Soviet assistance, North Korea's economy performed impressively during this period.[^39] By the 1960s, North Korea had achieved a slightly higher standard of living than South Korea, which was then suffering from political chaos and economic crises.[^40]

Kim's land reform program, implemented between 1946 and 1958, fundamentally transformed North Korean agriculture.[^41] Land was confiscated from Japanese colonizers and Korean landlords and redistributed, then subsequently collectivized into cooperative farms. While the collectivization process faced significant resistance—many farmers killed their livestock rather than surrender them to collective farms—the program succeeded in eliminating the traditional landlord class and establishing state control over agricultural production.[^42]

On the international stage, Kim achieved several diplomatic successes, particularly in positioning North Korea within the Non-Aligned Movement. Although the Democratic People's Republic of Korea initially faced skepticism from Third World nations, Kim successfully gained membership in the Non-Aligned Movement in August 1975.[^43] Between 1973 and 1979, Kim exchanged no fewer than 25 items of correspondence with Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, who served as Kim's mentor and advocate within the movement.[^44] This relationship was particularly remarkable given that Kim had spent over two decades denouncing Tito as ideologically backward and revisionist, demonstrating Kim's pragmatic flexibility in foreign policy when it served North Korea's interests.[^45]

Kim's longevity itself represents a kind of achievement in the brutal world of 20th-century authoritarian politics. He served as North Korea's supreme leader for more than 45 years, making him the third-longest serving non-royal head of state and government in the 20th century.[^46] Through systematic purges and the creation of an omnipresent personality cult, Kim successfully eliminated all potential rivals and established absolute personal control over every aspect of North Korean life—political, economic, and cultural.[^47]

Perhaps most significantly for the Kim family legacy, Kim established the world's first communist dynasty by successfully engineering the succession of his son, Kim Jong-il. At the 6th Workers' Party of Korea Congress in 1980, Kim's oldest son was elevated to the Presidium and officially designated as successor, institutionalizing hereditary rule.[^48] By the time of Kim Il-sung's death in 1994, the transition mechanism was firmly in place, allowing Kim Jong-il to assume power smoothly and ensuring the continuation of the Kim family's control over North Korea into the 21st century.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The Korean War stands as Kim Il-sung's most catastrophic and controversial decision. After obtaining approval from Joseph Stalin, Kim ordered the invasion of South Korea on June 25, 1950, sparking a three-year conflict that killed approximately three million people, more than half of whom were North Korean.[^50] The war, intended to reunify the Korean Peninsula under communist rule by force, ended in military stalemate and the continued division of Korea when an armistice was signed in July 1953.[^51] Kim's attempt at forcible reunification not only failed utterly but devastated the Korean Peninsula, leaving a legacy of division, militarization, and inter-Korean hostility that persists seven decades later.[^52]

Beyond the Korean War, Kim's regime engaged in systematic terrorism and provocations that damaged North Korea's international standing. The year 1968 proved particularly damaging. On January 21, Kim authorized the Blue House raid, sending 31 North Korean commandos to assassinate South Korean President Park Chung-hee.[^53] The commandos were intercepted near the presidential residence, resulting in fierce fighting that left 26 South Koreans and four Americans dead, along with 66 wounded, including 24 civilians.[^54] Just two days later, North Korean forces seized the USS Pueblo, a U.S. Navy intelligence ship, escalating tensions to the brink of another major war.[^55]

These 1968 incidents reflected Kim's strategic miscalculations. While Kim hoped to assist North Vietnam by opening a second front against the United States and to strengthen North Korea's alliance with China, the aggressive tactics backfired.[^56] The Pueblo crisis harmed Pyongyang's reputation in the Third World by demonstrating that Kim's guerrilla-style approach risked plunging the Korean Peninsula into catastrophic conflict.[^57] The incidents particularly damaged Kim's relationship with Vietnamese Communists, who had not requested such provocations, and further deteriorated already declining relations with the Soviet Union.[^58]

Kim's consolidation of absolute power required the systematic elimination of all potential rivals through brutal purges that consumed thousands of lives. Following the Korean War, Kim orchestrated a series of purges targeting the four major factions within the Korean Workers' Party: the domestic faction, his own guerrilla faction's rivals, the Soviet faction, and the Yan'an (Chinese) faction.[^59] Pak Hon-yong, leader of the Korean Communist Party, was purged and executed in 1955.[^60] The August 1956 faction incident represented a pivotal moment when Kim successfully resisted Soviet and Chinese pressure to institute collective leadership, instead consolidating his personal dictatorship.[^61] By 1961, only two members of the Soviet faction, three members of the Yan'an faction, and three members of the domestic faction remained in a Central Committee of 68 members.[^62] The 1967 Kapsan faction incident eliminated even these remnants, leading to the introduction of the Monolithic Ideological System that codified Kim's absolute authority.[^63]

The personality cult Kim created surpassed even those of his models, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, in its pervasiveness and extremity.[^64] Kim designated himself "Supreme Leader" and cultivated public belief in his immortality, infallibility, and omnipresence.[^65] By 1960, approximately 10,000 statues, portraits, or murals of Kim decorated Pyongyang alone.[^66] Every North Korean home was required to display Kim's portrait, with severe penalties—including imprisonment—for any damage to or removal of these images.[^67] When Kim died in 1994, citizens found not mourning were sent to prison.[^68] During the de-Stalinization period in the USSR in 1956, North Korean students studying in the Soviet Union who criticized Kim's growing personality cult upon their return home were subjected to intensive interrogation, with those deemed suspicious killed in secret.[^69]

Kim's most enduring crime was the establishment of a comprehensive system of political repression and human rights violations that continues to this day. In 1957, Kim created the songbun system, a rigid caste structure dividing North Korean society into three classes—"core," "wavering," or "hostile"—based on political, social, and economic background.[^70] The songbun system determined every aspect of existence: access to education, housing, employment, food rations, party membership, and residential permits.[^71] Those classified in the hostile class faced systematic discrimination, and many were forcibly relocated to North Korea's isolated and impoverished northern provinces.[^72]

Kim established an authoritarian government that systematically eradicated independent media, free trade unions, and all independent organizations.[^73] He created a hidden gulag system of political prison camps (kwanliso), fenced and heavily guarded colonies located in remote mountainous areas where prisoners performed back-breaking labor such as logging, mining, and agricultural work.[^74] Hundreds of thousands of North Koreans disappeared into these camps, from which few ever returned.[^75] Entire extended families of perceived dissenters were punished collectively by reduction to the lowest songbun rank and often incarcerated in the prison camp system.[^76] Eyewitness testimony from defectors documents gruesome public executions for possessing or importing Bibles and for participating in clandestine worship.[^77]

## Personal Life

Kim Il-sung's family life was carefully constructed to support his political power and dynastic ambitions, with family members integrated into North Korea's official mythology and personality cult. His mother, Kang Pan-sok, was posthumously elevated to the status of "mother of Korea," while his first wife, Kim Jong-suk, became known as the "mother of the revolution."[^78] This deliberate mythologizing of family members served to create a sacred revolutionary lineage that justified hereditary succession and enhanced the Kim family's claim to rule.

Kim Jong-suk (1917-1949) was Kim Il-sung's first wife and the mother of his heir, Kim Jong-il.[^79] She had been Kim's compatriot during the anti-Japanese guerrilla struggle in Manchuria, sharing the hardships and dangers of partisan warfare. Their relationship thus carried revolutionary legitimacy that Kim Il-sung exploited for political purposes. After Kim Jong-suk's death in 1949 under circumstances that remain somewhat mysterious, Kim married Kim Song-ae, who had worked as a clerical worker in the Ministry of National Defense.[^80]

Kim Song-ae first met Kim Il-sung in 1948 while working in his residence as an assistant to Kim Jong-suk.[^81] After the latter's death, Kim Song-ae assumed management of Kim Il-sung's household and domestic affairs. The couple married, and in 1953, Kim Song-ae gave birth to their first child, a daughter named Kim Kyong-jin.[^82] She subsequently had at least two sons with Kim Il-sung: Kim Pyong-il (born 1954) and Kim Yong-il (born 1955).[^83] However, Kim Il-sung's decision to designate Kim Jong-il—his son with his first wife—as successor created significant family tensions. Kim Song-ae reportedly advocated for her own sons to be considered for succession, but Kim Il-sung remained committed to the son who symbolized his guerrilla revolutionary heritage.[^84]

Kim Il-sung had two younger brothers who played supporting roles in his regime. Kim Ch'ŏl-chu remains a shadowy figure in historical records, but Kim Yong-ju became more prominent, earning the designation "the revolutionary fighter" within the family cult.[^85] The extended Kim family formed an elite political dynasty, with relatives occupying important positions throughout the party, military, and government apparatus.

As a leader, Kim Il-sung exhibited traits that psychological profiles suggest align with ISTJ personality characteristics: a strong sense of duty and responsibility, a logical and practical approach to problem-solving, and a preference for traditional values and established systems.[^86] However, these traits manifested in service of authoritarian control rather than democratic governance. Kim demonstrated remarkable political cunning in playing Chinese and Soviet patrons against each other, maintaining North Korean autonomy while extracting maximum economic and military aid from both.[^87]

Those who met Kim often commented on his charisma and leadership presence. Kim "emerged from the purge as a definitive leader, not only for the bold move but also for his compassion," according to some accounts, though this "compassion" was highly selective and did not extend to perceived enemies.[^88] His son Kim Jong-il was later described as having "inherited his father's kingdom but none of his charisma or leadership skills," suggesting that Kim Il-sung himself possessed significant personal magnetism that helped him maintain power.[^89]

Kim authored multi-volume autobiographical memoirs titled "With the Century," which covered his early life and revolutionary activities, though heavily filtered through the lens of his manufactured "glorious" image.[^90] In these memoirs, Kim systematically skipped details unfavorable to his legend and claimed credit for initiatives, such as the establishment of the 88th Special Brigade, that were actually Soviet in origin.[^91]

## Legacy

Kim Il-sung died from a heart attack at his home in Pyongyang on July 7, 1994, just days before a scheduled unprecedented summit with South Korean President Kim Young-sam that might have eased inter-Korean tensions.[^92] His death came at a crucial moment, cutting short what could have been a historic diplomatic breakthrough. In 1997, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea formally adopted Kim's birth year, 1912, as the base for a new Juche calendar, making Kim's birth the zero point of North Korean time itself.[^93] Upon his death, Kim was declared the "Eternal President" of North Korea, afforded near-godlike status that extends far beyond typical posthumous honors for deceased leaders.[^94]

The order Kim Il-sung built rests on six pillars that scholars identify as fundamental to the system: cult, control, secrecy, hierarchy, exploitation, and terror—all of which remain present in North Korea today, more than three decades after his death.[^95] This enduring institutional structure represents Kim's most significant legacy. Kim ensured that no national identity could exist apart from absolute submission to the leader, a principle his successors have maintained and intensified.[^96]

What distinguishes Kim Il-sung's legacy from those of other 20th-century dictators is its persistence. Stalin and Mao's legacies were largely dismantled by their successors within three years of their deaths—Khrushchev's de-Stalinization and Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms fundamentally repudiated key elements of their predecessors' systems.[^97] In stark contrast, more than 30 years after Kim Il-sung's death, North Korea still swears eternal loyalty to him, remains ruled by his bloodline through his grandson Kim Jong-un, and continues as the hypermilitarized, impoverished, closed society with a terrorized population that he envisioned.[^98]

The legacy of Kim Il-sung's manufactured collective memory continues to shape North Korean nationalism. As Kim consolidated power throughout the 1950s, the centrality of the anti-Japanese guerrilla revolution was emphasized across politics, economics, society, and literature.[^99] In North Korea today, the legacy of the guerrilla movement against Japan and the Korean War against the United States constitute essential elements of nationalism, with rulers using this carefully constructed historical narrative as rationale for national unification under North Korean rule.[^100]

Kim's economic legacy is decidedly mixed. While North Korea's state-run economy grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, it eventually stagnated, with critical food shortages emerging by the early 1990s.[^101] Kim's misguided policies created North Korean economic reliance on the Soviet Union and China, and his implementation of collective farming completely disregarded the expertise of individual farmers.[^102] Most problems that emerged during Kim Jong-il's era arose directly from policies established during his father's regime.[^103] The North Korean famine that began in the mid-1990s, coinciding with Kim Jong-il's assumption of power after Kim Il-sung's death, was attributed to the withdrawal of Soviet aid combined with the Stalinist economic system Kim Il-sung had created, which provided little incentive for food production.[^104] Between 1995 and 1998, severe flooding combined with systemic economic failure resulted in a devastating famine that killed between 900,000 and 2.4 million people.[^105]

The Kim dynasty itself represents Kim Il-sung's most visible legacy. The Kim family, officially designated the "Mount Paektu Bloodline," encompasses three generations of North Korean leadership: Kim Il-sung (1948-1994), Kim Jong-il (1994-2011), and Kim Jong-un (2011-present).[^106] This hereditary succession in a nominally communist state represents an unprecedented fusion of monarchy and totalitarianism, creating what analysts term a "personalist dictatorship" unlike any other in modern history.[^107]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Within North Korea, Kim Il-sung remains the object of veneration approaching religious worship, presented as the greatest Korean who ever lived and the father of the nation. Official North Korean historiography portrays him as a military genius who single-handedly defeated Japanese imperialism, a visionary who created an independent socialist paradise, and a philosopher who developed Juche thought as Korea's unique contribution to world revolutionary theory.[^108] This official narrative, while clearly propagandistic, represents how millions of North Koreans have been taught to understand their nation's founding.

Some scholars acknowledge that despite the exaggerations of the personality cult, Kim was indeed a significant anti-Japanese guerrilla fighter who demonstrated genuine military leadership and courage during the 1930s.[^109] The Poch'onbo raid and other guerrilla actions were real historical events that did strike blows against Japanese colonial control, even if their strategic impact was limited.[^110] In this narrow context, Kim's anti-colonial resistance credentials have some historical foundation, distinguishing him from leaders whose revolutionary biographies were entirely fabricated.

Sympathetic analysts, particularly from nations that were part of the Non-Aligned Movement, sometimes credited Kim with skillfully navigating the challenging geopolitics of the Cold War, maintaining North Korean sovereignty while extracting economic and military support from both the Soviet Union and China.[^111] From this perspective, Juche ideology represented a genuine attempt at ideological independence rather than mere subordination to either Moscow or Beijing, even if the practical implementation fell far short of true self-reliance.[^112]

Kim's ability to maintain stability in North Korea for 46 years, avoiding the coups and internal conflicts that plagued many post-colonial states, is sometimes noted as evidence of political acumen, though critics would argue this "stability" came at the cost of systematic terror and totalitarian control.[^113] Some observers point to the relatively successful economic performance of the 1950s and 1960s as evidence that Kim's early economic policies achieved real industrialization and development, at least before the system's inherent contradictions led to stagnation.[^114]

Defenders of Kim's legacy sometimes argue that many of North Korea's worst human rights abuses and economic failures emerged or intensified under his successors, suggesting that Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un bear responsibility for the system's most catastrophic outcomes.[^115] However, this argument fails to account for the fact that Kim Il-sung himself designed the institutional foundations—the songbun system, the prison camps, the personality cult, the command economy—that enabled these later atrocities.[^116]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among international scholars, human rights organizations, and defector testimony presents Kim Il-sung as one of the 20th century's most destructive dictators, responsible for millions of deaths and the creation of perhaps the world's most repressive state.[^117] Human Rights Watch has characterized Kim Il-sung's legacy as "catastrophic," establishing an authoritarian government that crushed dissent, abducted foreign nationals from South Korea, Japan, and elsewhere, and disappeared hundreds of thousands into a hidden gulag system from which few ever returned.[^118]

The United Nations Commission of Inquiry on human rights in North Korea heard extensive testimony from defectors, producing a 372-page report that serves as a devastating indictment of the North Korean system Kim created.[^119] By 2010-2011, approximately 23,000 North Korean refugees had reached South Korea, including hundreds of persons formerly detained in North Korea's variety of slave labor camps, penitentiaries, and detention facilities.[^120] Their consistent testimony provides overwhelming documentation of the systematic human rights violations built into the system Kim designed.[^121]

Scholars emphasize that Kim directed all aspects of economic, political, and cultural life in North Korea, providing the country with his personal ideology (Juche thought) and creating a cult of personality "without parallel in its excesses."[^122] The pervasiveness and extreme nature of North Korea's personality cult surpasses that of both Stalin and Mao, its original inspirations, reaching levels of totalitarian control unprecedented in modern history.[^123] Academic analysis characterizes the North Korean system as based on "cult, control, secrecy, hierarchy, exploitation, and terror," all of which remain operative today.[^124]

The Korean War, initiated by Kim's decision to invade South Korea in 1950, killed approximately three million people and devastated the Korean Peninsula, leaving a divided nation, massive militarization on both sides, and inter-Korean hatred that persists seventy years later.[^125] Kim's attempt at forcible reunification failed completely, achieving the opposite of his stated goal by hardening the division and making peaceful reunification infinitely more difficult.[^126]

Critics point to Kim's systematic elimination of all independent institutions and creation of absolute personal dictatorship as fundamentally anti-democratic and oppressive.[^127] The purges of the 1950s and 1960s that eliminated thousands of perceived rivals demonstrated ruthless consolidation of power that prioritized Kim's personal authority over any collective leadership or socialist principles.[^128] The songbun caste system created a hereditary discrimination structure that contradicts any genuine socialist or egalitarian principles.[^129]

Kim's economic legacy is viewed as fundamentally flawed. While achieving initial growth through massive Soviet and Chinese aid and by mobilizing North Korea's natural resources, the centrally planned economy Kim created proved unable to sustain development.[^130] His policies of extreme militarization, collective agriculture that destroyed farmer initiative, and Juche self-reliance that actually meant isolation from global economic integration, created the conditions for the catastrophic 1990s famine.[^131] Analysts note that Kim's economic policies resulted in North Korean complete dependence on Soviet and Chinese aid, meaning that when this support ended with the Soviet Union's collapse, the economy collapsed as well.[^132]
