## Summary

Dakis Nomin (達奇斯·諾賓, 1908-1930), known by his adopted Japanese name Hanaoka Ichirō (花岡一郎), was a Seediq Tgdaya man who became a tragic symbol of colonial identity conflict in Taiwan. As one of the first indigenous Taiwanese to receive higher education under Japanese rule, he worked as a police officer and represented the Japanese colonial administration's assimilation policy. His life ended in suicide during the 1930 Wushe Incident, an armed indigenous uprising against Japanese oppression. His death, along with that of his wife and relatives, highlighted the impossible position of indigenous people caught between their ancestral culture and colonial demands, making him a poignant figure in Taiwan's history of indigenous resistance and cultural survival.[^1][^2][^3]

---

## Early Life and Background

Dakis Nomin was born in 1908 in Gungu village, part of the Seediq Tgdaya group's traditional territory in what is now Nantou County, central Taiwan.[^4] The Seediq people were one of Taiwan's indigenous groups, characterized by their weaving culture, facial tattoos (patasan), and adherence to Gaya—the ancestral code of conduct and ethics that governed all aspects of life.[^5] According to Seediq legend, the people originated from Pusu Qhuni (the Central Mountain Range) and had gradually migrated and settled across mountainous regions of Taiwan.[^6]

Dakis Nomin grew up during a period of intense Japanese colonization. Taiwan had been ceded to Japan in 1895 following the First Sino-Japanese War, and by Dakis Nomin's childhood, the colonial administration had begun implementing aggressive assimilation policies targeting indigenous populations.[^7] The Japanese designated indigenous peoples as "raw barbarians" or "wild tribespeople," implementing policies designed to "tame" them through forced cultural change.[^8]

As a child, Dakis Nomin was selected for Japanese education—a rare opportunity that marked him as exceptional among his people. He attended primary school with Japanese children, becoming one of the first indigenous Taiwanese to receive high-level education.[^9] This education was part of Japan's strategy to create model indigenous citizens who would serve as bridges between colonial authorities and native communities. The young Seediq boy from Gungu village was given the Japanese name Hanaoka Ichirō and groomed to represent the success of Japan's civilization mission.[^10]

Growing up in Gungu village, Dakis Nomin knew Obing Nawi (歐嬪·那威), a Seediq girl from his community who would later become his wife under the Japanese name Kawano Hanako (川野花子).[^11] Both young people were exposed to Japanese language, customs, and worldview from an early age, setting them apart from their peers who maintained more traditional lifestyles.

---

## Rise to Prominence

Dakis Nomin's trajectory through the Japanese educational system was unprecedented for an indigenous Taiwanese person of his generation. He excelled in his studies and was cultivated by Japanese authorities as a showcase of successful assimilation.[^12] Along with Dakis Nawi (Hanaoka Jirō), another Seediq youth, he was presented to other indigenous communities as proof that aboriginal peoples could be elevated through Japanese civilization.[^13]

After completing his education, Dakis Nomin faced limited career options despite his qualifications. Though some sources indicate he graduated from a Japanese university, systemic discrimination meant he was offered positions far below his educational level and at significantly lower pay than Japanese colleagues.[^14] He initially chose to work as a teacher rather than a police officer, hoping to avoid being forced to take sides in conflicts between his Seediq people and his Japanese employers.[^15]

Eventually, however, Dakis Nomin became a police patrolman (junsa), working for the Japanese colonial police force that maintained order in indigenous territories.[^16] This role placed him in an extraordinarily difficult position. As a police officer, he was expected to enforce Japanese laws and policies that often oppressed his own people. He wore a Japanese uniform, spoke Japanese, and represented an authority that many Seediq viewed as illegitimate and cruel.

His position as a "model aboriginal" brought both privileges and isolation. The Japanese authorities showcased him as evidence of their benevolent civilization efforts, yet never fully accepted him as an equal. He remained, in Japanese eyes, a "half-civilized barbarian"—educated but ultimately inferior.[^17] Meanwhile, many in his own Seediq community viewed him with suspicion as someone who had abandoned ancestral ways and betrayed his people by serving the colonizers.[^18]

Dakis Nomin married Obing Nawi, who had similarly adopted Japanese education and the name Kawano Hanako. Together, they represented the Japanese vision of assimilated indigenous couples—wearing Japanese clothes, speaking Japanese, and working within the colonial system.[^19] Yet beneath this surface adaptation, profound tensions simmered.

---

## Major Achievements

Dakis Nomin's "achievements" must be understood within the context of colonial Taiwan, where success for an indigenous person meant navigating impossible contradictions. His primary accomplishment was becoming one of the first Seediq people to receive advanced Japanese education and secure a position within the colonial administration.[^20] This represented a significant individual achievement in an era when most indigenous Taiwanese were denied educational opportunities and relegated to forced labor.

As a police officer, Dakis Nomin served in Wushe (Musha), a mountainous region that remained a site of tension between Japanese authorities and Seediq communities.[^21] His fluency in both Seediq languages and Japanese, combined with his understanding of both cultures, made him valuable as a mediator and translator. He could communicate Japanese policies to his people and explain indigenous concerns to colonial administrators.

Japanese authorities used Dakis Nomin and Hanaoka Jirō as propaganda tools, showcasing them to other indigenous groups as examples of the benefits of cooperation and assimilation.[^22] They were living proof, the colonial government claimed, that indigenous people could improve their circumstances by embracing Japanese civilization. This role brought Dakis Nomin a degree of status and relative economic security that few Seediq people enjoyed.

Some historical accounts suggest Dakis Nomin attempted to use his position to advocate for his people, though the evidence is limited. When tensions escalated in Wushe during 1930, he reportedly tried to persuade Mona Rudao, the influential Seediq chief planning resistance, not to fight against the Japanese.[^23] Dakis Nomin argued that an uprising seemed suicidal given Japan's military superiority and that colonizers had brought some positive changes through modernization.

His wife, Obing Nawi (Kawano Hanako), similarly represented the possibility of indigenous women succeeding within the colonial system. She had received education, wore Japanese clothing, and worked in Japanese households, abandoning traditional Seediq weaving work.[^24] Together, they embodied the Japanese colonial ideal of the "civilized" indigenous couple.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Dakis Nomin's life was defined by controversy and the contradictions inherent in his position. Within Seediq society, many viewed him as a traitor who had sold out his people for personal advancement.[^25] As a police officer, he enforced Japanese laws that oppressed his own community—laws that banned traditional practices like facial tattooing and tooth filing, restricted hunting rights, imposed forced labor, and demanded tribute.[^26]

The Seediq people had endured systematic oppression under Japanese rule. They were forced into grueling labor extracting camphor from forests, subjected to unfair wages, and experienced ongoing police brutality.[^27] Indigenous women faced abuse, assault, and even trafficking.[^28] Between 1896 and 1930, local indigenous groups had mounted more than 150 armed uprisings against Japanese rule, evidence of widespread resentment.[^29] In this context, Dakis Nomin's choice to work as a Japanese police officer was seen by many Seediq as collaboration with an oppressive regime.

From the Japanese perspective, Dakis Nomin also represented a failure. Despite his education and apparent assimilation, he was never fully trusted or accepted. He was paid far less than Japanese officers with equivalent or lesser qualifications.[^30] He faced constant discrimination and was reminded that, no matter his education or service, he would always be viewed as inferior—a barbarian who had merely acquired a civilizing veneer.

The impossible nature of his position became clear as tensions escalated in Wushe. When Mona Rudao planned the uprising in response to years of accumulated grievances—particularly excessive forced labor and a specific incident where a Japanese police officer humiliated Mona Rudao's son at a wedding celebration—Dakis Nomin found himself unable to prevent the conflict or choose a side.[^31]

Critics from both communities questioned his identity. The Japanese questioned whether his loyalty truly lay with the empire or whether tribal blood would ultimately prove stronger. The Seediq questioned whether he retained any connection to Gaya, the ancestral laws that defined what it meant to be Seediq. Facial tattoos—symbols of adulthood, achievement, and identity that allowed ancestors to recognize their descendants in the afterlife—had been denied to him and his generation.[^32] Without these marks, could he truly claim Seediq identity?

His attempts to serve as a bridge between cultures satisfied neither side. He was rejected by both—dismissed as a half-civilized barbarian by Japanese and as a traitor by many Seediq.[^33]

---

## Personal Life

Dakis Nomin married Obing Nawi, who adopted the Japanese name Kawano Hanako. She was from his village and had known him since childhood.[^34] Like her husband, Obing Nawi had received Japanese education and worked within the colonial system, employed in Japanese households. She wore Japanese clothing and had abandoned traditional Seediq weaving, the craft that traditionally marked Seediq women's skill and worthiness for facial tattoos.[^35]

The couple's personal life reflected the cultural tensions that defined their public roles. At home, they spoke Japanese and maintained Japanese customs, yet they remained connected to their Seediq relatives and community. They lived in Wushe, surrounded by both Japanese colonial officials and Seediq villagers who viewed them with varying degrees of respect, envy, suspicion, and contempt.

Historical records provide limited details about Dakis Nomin's personality or private thoughts. The accounts that survive, filtered through Japanese colonial media and later historical interpretations, portray him as deeply conflicted—a man torn between two identities, fully belonging to neither world.[^36] He reportedly experienced what later scholars would describe as "cultural schizophrenia," an identity crisis so profound that it left him psychologically tormented.[^37]

During the Wushe Incident on October 27, 1930, when Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in attacks on Japanese targets during a school athletics meet, Dakis Nomin did not participate in the uprising.[^38] His wife, Obing Nawi, wearing Japanese clothes, was present at the school attack. She was spared from violence only because her husband covered her with native cloth, a gesture that temporarily obscured her Japanese appearance and assimilationist identity.[^39]

In the aftermath of the attack, which resulted in the deaths of 134 Japanese and two Han Taiwanese children, Dakis Nomin and his relatives faced an impossible situation.[^40] They could not join the uprising without betraying their Japanese employers and education; they could not remain loyal to Japan without confirming their people's view of them as traitors.

---

## Death and Final Act

In November 1930, after the Wushe uprising had begun but before the Japanese military response fully crushed the resistance, Dakis Nomin and his wife Obing Nawi, along with other relatives, chose suicide.[^41] Before taking their lives, they left a note explaining that the uprising had occurred because of excessive forced labor imposed on indigenous people by the Japanese—a testament that validated their people's grievances even as their position had made them appear as collaborators.[^42]

The manner of their deaths reflected their dual identity. Some accounts indicate they performed seppuku (ritual suicide by disembowelment), a Japanese method, while others mention hanging.[^43] Their chosen methods of death seemed to embody the cultural conflict that had defined their lives—even in dying, they were haunted by tensions between loyalty to Seediq traditions and loyalty to Japanese culture.

A portrayal of their final moments, dramatized in the 2011 film "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale," captures the essence of their dilemma. Before performing seppuku, Dakis Nomin asks Hanaoka Jirō (Dakis Nawi): "Jiro, are we subjects of Japan's Mikado... or the descendants of the Seediq ancestors?" Jirō responds: "Do it. Cut it up and end your conflicts right here and now. We don't have to go anywhere once we're dead. Let's both be free wandering spirits."[^44]

Their suicides were widely reported by colonial media, which portrayed the deaths as tragic but inevitable consequences of the uprising.[^45] The Japanese colonial government used their deaths to demonstrate the violence and chaos caused by Mona Rudao's rebellion, while also mourning the loss of model indigenous citizens who represented the success of assimilation policies.

For the Seediq community, the deaths carried different meanings. Some viewed the suicides as ultimate betrayals—deaths that aligned more with Japanese ritual than Seediq tradition. Others saw them as tragic confirmations of the impossible position created by colonialism, deaths that revealed the psychological violence of forced assimilation. The suicide note's acknowledgment of excessive forced labor suggested that, in the end, Dakis Nomin recognized and validated his people's suffering, even if he had been unable to actively resist during his life.

## Legacy

Dakis Nomin's legacy is complex and contested, embodying the contradictions of colonial Taiwan's indigenous experience. He has become a symbol of the psychological and cultural violence inflicted by colonialism—a reminder that oppression operates not only through physical force but also through the destruction of identity and the creation of impossible choices.[^46]

In the immediate aftermath of the Wushe Incident, Japanese colonial authorities deployed overwhelming military force, including troops, police, artillery, aircraft, and controversially, poison gas and incendiary bombs.[^47] They also enlisted rival indigenous groups to fight against the Seediq rebels.[^48] Mona Rudao committed suicide on November 28, 1930, but the uprising continued under other leaders.[^49] Over 600 Seediq people died in the conflict and subsequent military operations.[^50]

Approximately 500 Seediq people eventually surrendered and were confined to a village near Wushe. On April 25, 1931, in what became known as the "Second Wushe Incident," indigenous groups working with Japanese authorities attacked the village, beheading all remaining males over the age of 15—216 people in total.[^51] The survivors were forcibly relocated from their traditional homeland to a settlement called Qingliu, a valley much lower down in Nantou.[^52]

The Wushe Incident and its aftermath led to significant criticism of Japanese colonial policies and prompted changes in how Taiwan's indigenous peoples were administered.[^53] However, the fundamental structure of colonial oppression remained until Japan's defeat in World War II ended its rule over Taiwan in 1945.

Dakis Nomin's story survived through oral histories within Seediq communities and through Japanese colonial records. Scholar Dakis Pawan, a descendant from the Wushe region who shares a similar Seediq name, spent two decades recording Seediq culture and researching the Wushe Incident, helping preserve stories of figures like Dakis Nomin.[^54]

The 2011 Taiwanese epic film "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale," directed by Wei Te-sheng, brought Dakis Nomin's story to international audiences. The film, which sparked renewed interest in the Wushe Uprising, portrayed the tragedy of being caught between two cultures through the character of Dakis Nomin (portrayed by actor Yi-Fan Hsu/Hsu Yi-fan).[^55] The film depicted him as deeply conflicted—a man who graduated from Japanese university but faced discrimination and low wages, who chose teaching over police work to avoid taking sides, yet was ultimately rejected by both Japanese and Seediq communities.[^56]

Today, the Seediq people are one of Taiwan's officially recognized indigenous groups, having been formally acknowledged as distinct from the Atayal on April 23, 2008.[^57] The Wushe Incident Memorial Park in Nantou County commemorates the uprising and the lives lost, including those of conflicted figures like Dakis Nomin.[^58]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who study colonial psychology and indigenous identity view Dakis Nomin as a tragic figure worthy of empathy and understanding. His story illuminates the profound psychological damage inflicted by colonial assimilation policies, which created what anthropologists call "cultural schizophrenia"—a condition where individuals are torn between irreconcilable cultural identities.[^59]

Some historians argue that Dakis Nomin should be understood not as a traitor but as someone who attempted to navigate an impossible situation with limited options. In an era when most indigenous Taiwanese were subjected to forced labor, violence, and cultural destruction, his educational achievement represented a form of survival and resistance—proof that indigenous people possessed the intellectual capacity that Japanese racial theories denied.[^60]

Indigenous studies scholars note that his suicide note, which explicitly stated that the uprising occurred because of excessive forced labor on indigenous people, represents a form of testimony and resistance.[^61] Even though he did not participate in the armed uprising, his final statement validated Seediq grievances and provided historical evidence of colonial oppression.

Contemporary Seediq descendants and scholars like Dakis Pawan have worked to preserve the complex histories of this period without reducing figures like Dakis Nomin to simple categories of hero or traitor. Their efforts emphasize the importance of understanding the structural violence of colonialism that created impossible choices for indigenous people.[^62]

The film "Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale" has been praised by some scholars for its nuanced portrayal of Dakis Nomin and others in similar positions, showing how colonial systems destroyed individuals by forcing them to choose between cultures, families, and identities.[^63] This portrayal has contributed to broader discussions in Taiwan about colonial history, indigenous rights, and the ongoing process of addressing historical injustices.

### Negative Views

Critics, particularly within Seediq communities and among indigenous rights advocates, view Dakis Nomin less sympathetically. From this perspective, he made a conscious choice to serve the colonial apparatus that oppressed his people, and that choice—regardless of the pressures he faced—made him complicit in their suffering.[^64]

As a police officer, Dakis Nomin enforced laws and policies that banned sacred Seediq traditions like facial tattooing, restricted hunting rights essential to Seediq male identity, and facilitated the forced labor system that exploited his people.[^65] His role was not passive or merely symbolic; it involved active participation in a system of cultural genocide and economic exploitation.

Some historians argue that focusing too much on the psychological suffering of assimilated indigenous elites like Dakis Nomin risks obscuring the far greater suffering of the broader indigenous population who faced physical violence, poverty, cultural destruction, and death.[^66] While Dakis Nomin experienced identity crisis and discrimination, most Seediq people experienced conditions far worse—starvation wages, brutal forced labor, sexual violence, and systematic destruction of their way of life.

Critics also note that the Japanese colonial system created a small class of indigenous collaborators who received relative privileges in exchange for helping maintain control over their communities. This "divide and conquer" strategy was essential to Japanese rule, and figures like Dakis Nomin, regardless of their personal suffering, enabled this system to function.[^67]

The Second Wushe Incident of 1931, when indigenous groups allied with Japan massacred Seediq survivors, demonstrates the devastating consequences of colonial collaboration.[^68] By creating divisions within and between indigenous communities, the Japanese were able to use indigenous people as weapons against each other—a strategy that depended on collaborators and assimilated figures.

Some scholars argue that while individual empathy for Dakis Nomin's impossible position is understandable, historically it is more important to analyze the colonial structures that created such positions than to focus on the psychological suffering of those who, however reluctantly, served those structures.[^69]

## Cultural Significance

The story of Dakis Nomin resonates beyond Taiwan's indigenous communities, speaking to universal themes of colonialism, identity, and the psychological violence of forced assimilation. His life and death illuminate the ways colonial systems destroy individuals not only through physical violence but through the erosion of identity and the creation of impossible loyalties.

In contemporary Taiwan, discussions of Dakis Nomin contribute to ongoing debates about historical justice for indigenous peoples, the legacies of Japanese colonialism, and the construction of Taiwanese national identity. The Seediq people, now officially recognized and working to revitalize their language and cultural practices, view figures like Dakis Nomin as part of a complex history that must be understood in its full complexity—neither celebrated nor condemned simplistically, but examined as evidence of colonialism's profound human costs.[^73]

The revival of interest in Seediq history, sparked partly by the 2011 film, has contributed to broader efforts to preserve indigenous languages, traditions, and historical memory. Young Seediq people have been working to learn their ancestral language, understand traditional practices like weaving and facial tattooing, and reclaim cultural identity that colonialism attempted to destroy.[^74]

Dakis Nomin's legacy ultimately serves as a reminder that understanding history requires grappling with complexity and contradiction. His story resists simple narratives of resistance or collaboration, instead revealing how systems of oppression operate through both violence and seduction, forcing individuals into positions where every choice carries profound costs.
