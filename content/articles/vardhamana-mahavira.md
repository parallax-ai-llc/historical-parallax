## Summary

Vardhamana Mahavira was the 24th and last Tirthankara (ford-maker) of Jainism and the religion's most important historical figure. He renounced his royal life at age 30 and practiced extreme asceticism for 12 years before attaining omniscience (kevala jnana). He taught the principles of ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), and aparigraha (non-attachment). His teachings were organized into the Jain Agamas by his disciples.
