## Overview

The March 1st Movement (3.1운동, 삼일운동) was one of the largest and earliest displays of Korean resistance against Japanese colonial rule (1910-1945). Beginning on March 1, 1919, with the reading of the Korean Declaration of Independence, the movement spread across the peninsula, involving an estimated 2 million participants. Though brutally suppressed, it demonstrated Korean desire for independence and influenced independence movements worldwide.

## Background

### Japanese Colonial Rule (1910-1919)

**Annexation (1910):**
Japan formally annexed Korea, ending the Joseon Dynasty (which had ruled since 1392).

**"Dark Period" Policies:**
- Korean language suppressed in schools
- Korean newspapers banned
- Forced cultural assimilation
- Land ownership transferred to Japanese
- Economic exploitation
- Political repression

**Growing Resentment:**
By 1919, Koreans widely resented colonial rule despite surface calm.

### International Context

**Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points:**
U.S. President's principles (1918) included "self-determination of peoples." Inspired colonized peoples worldwide.

**Paris Peace Conference (1919):**
Though Korea was not represented, the conference raised hopes.

**Death of King Gojong (January 21, 1919):**
Former emperor died; rumors he was poisoned by Japanese. National mourning became opportunity for gathering.
