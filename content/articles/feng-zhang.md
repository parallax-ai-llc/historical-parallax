## Summary

Feng Zhang was among the first to adapt CRISPR-Cas9 for genome editing in mammalian cells, independently of Doudna and Charpentier. His work at the Broad Institute demonstrated that CRISPR could edit genes in human and mouse cells. He also developed optogenetics tools and discovered new CRISPR systems, expanding the gene editing toolkit.
