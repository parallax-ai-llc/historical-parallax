## Summary

Ariel Sharon (1928-2014) was one of Israel's most controversial and consequential figures, serving as both a legendary military commander and the 11th Prime Minister of Israel from 2001 to 2006. Known as "The Bulldozer" for his forceful personality and uncompromising approach, Sharon played pivotal roles in every major Israeli military conflict from the 1948 War of Independence through the Lebanon War of 1982. His career was marked by brilliant military tactics, fierce dedication to Israeli security, and deep controversies including his role in the Sabra and Shatila massacre and his provocative visit to the Temple Mount that sparked the Second Intifada. In a dramatic political transformation late in life, Sharon orchestrated Israel's unilateral disengagement from Gaza in 2005, breaking with his own Likud party to form Kadima, before suffering a massive stroke that left him in a vegetative state until his death in 2014.

## Early Life and Background

Ariel Sharon was born Ariel Scheinermann on February 26, 1928, in Kfar Malal, a moshav (agricultural cooperative) in Mandatory Palestine. His parents, Shmuel and Vera Scheinermann, were secular Jewish immigrants from Russia who had fled the Bolshevik Revolution and arrived in Palestine in 1922. The family lived a hardscrabble existence as farmers, and young Ariel grew up in an environment where self-reliance, physical labor, and defense against Arab attacks were constant realities.[^1]

Sharon's childhood was shaped by the conflict between Jewish settlers and Arab neighbors. Kfar Malal was frequently subjected to raids, and Sharon recalled how his parents and other settlers would patrol the perimeter with weapons. This early exposure to violence and the need for constant vigilance deeply influenced his worldview and his later philosophy that Israel's survival depended on military strength and territorial control.[^2]

Despite the harsh conditions, Sharon was an excellent student with a particular interest in agriculture and military history. He joined the Haganah, the main Jewish paramilitary organization, at age 14 in 1942, beginning a military career that would span decades. His family's Mapai (Labor) political affiliation and pioneering Zionist ideology provided the foundation for his early political consciousness, though he would later shift dramatically rightward in his political journey.[^3]

Sharon received his secondary education at the agricultural school in Kfar Malal and later studied agriculture at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. However, his formal education was repeatedly interrupted by military service, and he never completed his degree. His true education came on the battlefield, where he would prove himself one of the most talented and aggressive military commanders in Israeli history.[^4]

## Rise to Power

Sharon's military career began in earnest during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when he served as a platoon commander in the Alexandroni Brigade. He was seriously wounded in the groin and abdomen during the battle for Latrun, an experience that hardened his resolve and earned him his first decorations for bravery. During this period, he changed his surname from Scheinermann to the more Hebrew-sounding Sharon, taking the name from the Sharon plain in central Israel.[^5]

His real ascent began in 1953 when he was appointed commander of Unit 101, an elite special forces unit tasked with carrying out reprisal operations against Palestinian fedayeen infiltrators and the Arab countries that harbored them. Sharon's aggressive tactics and willingness to exceed his orders soon became his trademark. The most notorious operation under his command was the Qibya raid in October 1953, where his forces killed 69 Jordanian civilians, many of them women and children who died when buildings were demolished on top of them. The incident drew international condemnation, though it also established Sharon's reputation as a commander who would stop at nothing to achieve his objectives.[^6]

In 1956, during the Suez Crisis, Sharon commanded a paratroop brigade and led successful operations in the Sinai Peninsula, further cementing his status as a rising military star. However, his relationship with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) establishment was often strained due to his insubordination and tendency to pursue his own tactical vision regardless of orders.[^7]

Sharon's defining military moment came during the 1967 Six-Day War, where he commanded an armored division that played a crucial role in the decisive victory in the Sinai. But it was the 1973 Yom Kippur War that truly elevated him to legendary status. Recalled from retirement to command an armored division, Sharon executed a daring and controversial crossing of the Suez Canal that encircled the Egyptian Third Army and turned the tide of the war. His actions were militarily brilliant but politically problematic, as he repeatedly disobeyed orders from his superiors, creating lasting tensions with the military establishment.[^8]

Following his military career, Sharon entered politics in 1973, joining the Likud party and winning a Knesset seat. He served in various ministerial positions, including Minister of Agriculture (1977-1981) where he dramatically expanded Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and Minister of Defense (1981-1983), a position from which he would orchestrate the controversial 1982 Lebanon War.[^9]

## Major Achievements

Sharon's military achievements were extraordinary by any measure. He is widely credited with being one of the most innovative and tactically brilliant commanders in modern military history. His development of counter-insurgency tactics, his pioneering use of armored and airborne forces in desert warfare, and his ability to execute complex maneuvers under extreme pressure made him a subject of study in military academies worldwide.[^10]

The Suez Canal crossing in 1973 remains a textbook example of military audacity and operational excellence. Against orders and with minimal support, Sharon identified a gap between Egyptian armies and led his forces across the canal, establishing a bridgehead that allowed Israeli forces to encircle a major Egyptian formation. Military historians have compared this operation to some of the greatest feats of military commanders in history, demonstrating Sharon's ability to see opportunities that others missed and to take calculated risks that paid enormous dividends.[^11]

As Minister of Agriculture from 1977 to 1981, Sharon fundamentally transformed the landscape of the West Bank and Gaza Strip through an aggressive settlement expansion program. He established scores of new settlements in strategic locations, creating "facts on the ground" that would make any future Israeli withdrawal from these territories far more difficult. While deeply controversial, this policy achieved Sharon's stated goal of ensuring permanent Israeli control over what he considered the historic Land of Israel. By the time he left the Agriculture Ministry, the settler population had grown from approximately 5,000 to over 20,000.[^12]

Sharon played a central role in Operation Opera, the 1981 Israeli air strike that destroyed Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor. As a member of the security cabinet, Sharon was one of the strongest advocates for the operation, which prevented Saddam Hussein from developing nuclear weapons and remains one of the most successful preemptive military strikes in history.[^13]

Perhaps Sharon's most transformative and unexpected achievement came at the end of his career: the 2005 Gaza disengagement. Despite a lifetime spent promoting and defending Israeli settlements, Prime Minister Sharon made the dramatic decision to unilaterally withdraw all Israeli settlers and military forces from the Gaza Strip and four settlements in the northern West Bank. The operation required the forced evacuation of approximately 8,500 Israeli settlers and the dismantling of 21 settlements. Sharon argued that the disengagement was necessary for Israel's security and demographic future, and he faced down fierce opposition from his own Likud party and the settler movement he had once championed.[^14]

To implement the disengagement, Sharon took the unprecedented step of leaving Likud and forming a new centrist party, Kadima, in November 2005. Polls suggested Kadima would win a substantial victory in the upcoming elections, indicating that Sharon had successfully repositioned himself as a pragmatic leader willing to make difficult territorial compromises for peace and security. This political reinvention, at age 77, demonstrated remarkable flexibility and political courage.[^15]

Sharon also strengthened Israel's relationship with the United States, particularly during the George W. Bush administration. His close coordination with Washington on security matters and his willingness to accept the framework of Bush's "Roadmap for Peace" (even while implementing it selectively) helped maintain crucial American diplomatic and military support for Israel during a turbulent period.[^16]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Sharon's career was marked by numerous controversies that made him one of the most polarizing figures in Israeli and Middle Eastern history. The Qibya massacre in 1953, where Unit 101 under Sharon's command killed 69 Jordanian civilians, was only the first of many incidents that would stain his reputation. An Israeli government inquiry later determined that Sharon had been explicitly ordered to avoid civilian casualties but had exceeded his mandate. Critics argued that this established a pattern of recklessness and disregard for civilian life that would characterize his entire career.[^17]

The defining controversy of Sharon's career was the 1982 Lebanon War and the subsequent Sabra and Shatila massacre. As Defense Minister, Sharon was the principal architect of Israel's invasion of Lebanon, which he claimed was necessary to eliminate the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) threat to northern Israel. However, Sharon misled the Israeli cabinet about the scope and objectives of the operation, transforming what was supposed to be a limited 40-kilometer incursion into a full-scale invasion that reached Beirut and resulted in thousands of casualties.[^18]

The worst atrocity came in September 1982, when Lebanese Christian Phalangist militias allied with Israel massacred between 800 and 3,500 Palestinian refugees (estimates vary widely) in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Beirut. Israeli forces under Sharon's command controlled the area and had allowed the Phalangists to enter the camps, ostensibly to root out PLO fighters. Israeli soldiers illuminated the camps with flares during the nighttime massacre and prevented refugees from escaping. The Kahan Commission, an Israeli inquiry into the massacre, found Sharon "indirectly responsible" for the killings and recommended his dismissal as Defense Minister. Sharon was forced to resign but remained in the cabinet as Minister without Portfolio.[^19]

The massacre prompted massive protests in Israel, with an estimated 400,000 Israelis (about 10% of the population) gathering in Tel Aviv to demand accountability. International condemnation was fierce, and Sharon became a symbol of Israeli brutality in much of the world. In 2001, Belgian lawyers attempted to prosecute Sharon for war crimes related to Sabra and Shatila, though the case was ultimately dismissed on immunity grounds.[^20]

Sharon's provocative visit to the Temple Mount (Haram al-Sharif) on September 28, 2000, is widely credited with triggering the Second Intifada, which resulted in thousands of deaths over the following years. Sharon, then leader of the opposition, visited the contested holy site with an escort of over 1,000 Israeli police officers. Palestinians viewed the visit as a deliberate provocation and an assertion of Israeli sovereignty over the third-holiest site in Islam. Riots erupted the next day, marking the beginning of years of violence. Critics accused Sharon of cynically provoking the conflict to advance his political prospects, though Sharon and his defenders maintained he had every right to visit the site and that Palestinian leaders used the visit as a pretext for violence they had already planned.[^21]

Throughout his career, Sharon was accused of systematic violations of international humanitarian law, including the illegal expansion of settlements, the demolition of Palestinian homes, and the policy of targeted assassinations of Palestinian leaders. Human rights organizations documented numerous instances where military operations under Sharon's command or political authority resulted in disproportionate civilian casualties.[^22]

Sharon's authoritarian leadership style also drew criticism. He frequently exceeded his authority, misled civilian leadership about military operations, and pursued his own agenda regardless of official policy. During the 1973 war, his insubordination was so flagrant that Chief of Staff David Elazar considered relieving him of command. Similarly, his deception of the Israeli cabinet regarding the true objectives of the Lebanon War represented a fundamental breach of democratic civilian control over the military.[^23]

Even Sharon's Gaza disengagement, while praised by some, was condemned by others as a unilateral action that rewarded Palestinian terrorism, strengthened Hamas, and ultimately led to increased rocket attacks on southern Israel after the withdrawal. Critics on the right viewed it as a betrayal of the settlers and a surrender of Biblical Jewish land, while critics on the left argued it was implemented without coordination with Palestinian authorities and thus failed to advance peace.[^24]

## Personal Life

Ariel Sharon married twice and had three sons. His first wife, Margalit (Gali), whom he married in 1953, died in a car accident in 1962, leaving him to raise their son Gur alone. Tragically, Gur died in 1967 at age 11 when a friend accidentally shot him while they were playing with a rifle. These deaths profoundly affected Sharon and by many accounts contributed to his hardened personality and emotional reserve.[^25]

In 1963, Sharon married his first wife's younger sister, Lily, in a relationship that was considered scandalous at the time but became a legendary love story in Israeli lore. Lily and Ariel had two sons together, Omri and Gilad. The family lived on a ranch called Sycamore Farm (Havat Hashikma) in the Negev desert, where Sharon indulged his passion for agriculture and maintained a large herd of sheep. The farm became his retreat from political life and a symbol of his connection to the land.[^26]

Lily Sharon died of cancer in 2000, a loss that devastated Sharon. Those close to him reported that he was never quite the same after her death, though he channeled his grief into his political work. His sons, particularly Omri, became increasingly involved in his political career, with Omri serving as a Knesset member. However, both Omri and Gilad were implicated in financial scandals related to their father's political campaigns, and Omri was eventually convicted and served prison time for illegal campaign financing, perjury, and obstruction of justice.[^27]

Sharon was known for his larger-than-life personality. He was physically imposing, standing over six feet tall and weighing well over 250 pounds for much of his later life. His appetite was legendary—he was famous for massive breakfasts and multi-course meals. This physical presence matched his political persona: aggressive, uncompromising, and dominating.[^28]

Despite his harsh public image, those who knew Sharon personally often described a different side. He was said to be warm with close friends and family, had a deep knowledge of Jewish history and archaeology, and could be charming and funny in private settings. He was particularly devoted to his grandchildren and found solace in agricultural work on his farm.[^29]

Sharon was essentially secular in his religious practice, though he had a strong connection to Jewish tradition and history. He saw himself as continuing the pioneering Zionist project of his parents' generation, defending and expanding Jewish sovereignty over the Land of Israel. This sense of historical mission drove much of his political and military career.[^30]

In January 2006, Sharon suffered a massive stroke that left him in a permanent vegetative state. He remained comatose for eight years, cared for at a long-term care facility near Tel Aviv, until his death on January 11, 2014, at age 85. The extended period between his incapacitation and death created an unusual situation where his political legacy remained in suspension, neither fully concluded nor capable of further evolution.[^31]

## Legacy

Ariel Sharon's legacy is deeply contested and multifaceted, reflecting the complexity of the man and the conflicts he shaped. Within Israel, he is remembered by many as a war hero who devoted his life to defending the Jewish state, a brilliant military tactician who saved Israel during its darkest hour in 1973, and a pragmatic leader who made difficult decisions about Israel's future. The massive public turnout at his funeral, attended by dignitaries from around the world, testified to his stature as one of Israel's most significant leaders.[^32]

For the Israeli right and the settler movement, Sharon's legacy is complicated by what they view as his betrayal in implementing the Gaza disengagement. Many settlers who had revered him as their champion felt personally betrayed, and some still refuse to forgive what they see as the abandonment of Jewish communities and the surrender of land that cost Israeli blood to capture. The fact that Gaza subsequently came under Hamas control and became a launching pad for rocket attacks seemed to vindicate their warnings.[^33]

Conversely, Sharon's late-career evolution toward territorial compromise impressed many centrists and left-wing Israelis who had long opposed him. Some historians argue that Sharon's Gaza disengagement represented a crucial recognition that Israel could not permanently control millions of Palestinians without sacrificing either its democratic character or its Jewish majority. His willingness to confront his own ideological camp demonstrated political courage that earned him grudging respect even from former critics.[^34]

Internationally, Sharon remains a deeply controversial figure. In much of the Arab and Muslim world, he is remembered as a war criminal responsible for massacres at Qibya, Sabra and Shatila, and countless other Palestinian deaths. The epithet "Butcher of Beirut" continues to define his image in many countries. His policies of settlement expansion and military operations are viewed as fundamental obstacles to Palestinian statehood and peace.[^35]

Western perspectives on Sharon vary considerably. Some analysts credit him with hard-headed realism about Middle Eastern security challenges and praise his willingness to take unilateral action when negotiations proved fruitless. Others condemn his record of human rights violations and argue that his aggressive policies made the Israeli-Palestinian conflict more intractable.[^36]

Sharon's military innovations continue to influence doctrine in the Israel Defense Forces and other militaries worldwide. His emphasis on offensive action, his combined-arms coordination, and his willingness to take tactical risks remain subjects of study. The IDF's current operational concepts owe much to Sharon's pioneering work in armored warfare and special operations.[^37]

The settlements that Sharon established throughout the West Bank remain one of the most contentious issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. His vision of creating irreversible facts on the ground has largely succeeded—the settler population has grown from the thousands to the hundreds of thousands, making a two-state solution vastly more complicated if not impossible. Whether one views this as a success or a catastrophe depends entirely on one's perspective on the conflict.[^38]

Sharon's political legacy includes the transformation of Israeli politics through the creation of Kadima, which briefly became the dominant centrist force before fragmenting after his incapacitation. The party's rise and fall illustrated both the power of Sharon's personal political appeal and the difficulty of sustaining a centrist coalition without his leadership.[^39]

Perhaps most significantly, Sharon embodied the transformation of Israeli society from the idealistic, socialist Zionism of the state's founders to a more nationalist, security-focused paradigm. His career traced the arc of Israel's evolution from a scrappy underdog to a regional military superpower, and from a nation seeking peace to one prioritizing defensible borders and unilateral action.[^40]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Sharon emphasize his extraordinary military achievements and his pragmatic approach to Israeli security. Military historians like Martin van Creveld have praised Sharon as one of the greatest tactical commanders of the 20th century, comparing his Suez Canal crossing to Hannibal's crossing of the Alps. His ability to see the battlefield differently from his contemporaries and to execute complex operations under pressure demonstrated military genius that transcended the specific context of Israeli conflicts.[^41]

Israeli historians sympathetic to Sharon's legacy, such as Uri Dan (his authorized biographer), portray him as a patriot who made difficult decisions in impossible circumstances. They argue that his aggressive military tactics, while sometimes causing civilian casualties, were necessary responses to existential threats facing Israel. The Qibya raid, in this view, was a harsh but effective message that attacks on Israeli civilians would not go unpunished. The Lebanon War, despite its costs, eliminated the PLO threat to northern Israel and led to a peace treaty with Lebanon (even though it eventually collapsed).[^42]

Defenders of Sharon's settlement policy argue that he understood the strategic importance of controlling the West Bank highlands for Israel's security. Given Israel's narrow width at its pre-1967 borders (as little as 9 miles at one point), the settlements created strategic depth and made it militarily unfeasible for Arab armies to cut Israel in half. From this perspective, Sharon was a strategic visionary who ensured Israel's long-term security through territorial expansion.[^43]

Conservative American commentators and supporters of Israel, particularly during the George W. Bush administration, praised Sharon as a strong ally in the war on terrorism and a leader who understood the need for decisive action against terrorist organizations. They contrasted his willingness to take controversial but necessary actions with what they saw as European and UN weakness and moral relativism.[^44]

Sharon's Gaza disengagement earned him praise from unexpected quarters, with some former critics acknowledging his evolution and courage in confronting the settler movement he had built. Commentators like Thomas Friedman argued that Sharon's willingness to change course demonstrated the kind of leadership the Middle East needed—pragmatic, willing to challenge sacred cows, and focused on Israel's long-term interests rather than ideology.[^45]

Psychological and political analyses by scholars like Yehuda Avner have emphasized Sharon's deep connection to the land of Israel and his genuine belief that his actions, however harsh, were necessary for Jewish survival. This interpretation portrays Sharon not as a cynical opportunist but as a true believer in Zionism who saw himself as continuing the work of defending and building the Jewish homeland.[^46]

### Negative Views

Critics of Sharon, including many historians and human rights advocates, view him as a war criminal who systematically violated international law and bears responsibility for thousands of deaths. Noted Israeli historian Avi Shlaim has described Sharon as "one of the most brutal and ruthless Israeli leaders," arguing that his military operations consistently showed disregard for civilian life and international norms.[^47]

The Kahan Commission's finding that Sharon bore "indirect responsibility" for the Sabra and Shatila massacre is cited by critics as evidence of his culpability for war crimes. Legal scholars like Richard Falk have argued that Sharon's actions met the criteria for prosecution under international humanitarian law, and that his escape from justice reflected the political protection afforded to Israeli leaders rather than the merits of the case.[^48]

Palestinian historians and commentators universally condemn Sharon as the architect of policies that made Palestinian statehood nearly impossible and caused immense suffering to Palestinian civilians. His settlement expansion, home demolitions, and military operations are viewed as systematic ethnic cleansing and colonization. The provocative Temple Mount visit is seen as a deliberate attempt to sabotage the peace process and provoke violence that would justify further crackdowns.[^49]

Israeli peace activists and left-wing commentators like Gideon Levy have argued that Sharon's military brilliance was matched by moral blindness and political recklessness. They contend that his aggressive policies entrenched the occupation, brutalized both Palestinian society and the Israeli military, and made a peaceful resolution to the conflict vastly more difficult. The Gaza disengagement, in this view, was not enlightened pragmatism but a cynical redeployment to strengthen Israel's hold on the West Bank.[^50]

Scholarly assessments in international relations often characterize Sharon as a leader whose short-term tactical successes created long-term strategic disasters. The Lebanon War, while militarily successful in some respects, led to an 18-year occupation of southern Lebanon, the rise of Hezbollah (a far more dangerous enemy than the PLO), and international isolation. Similarly, his settlement policies created facts on the ground that may ultimately prove unsustainable and threaten Israel's democratic and Jewish character.[^51]

Critics also emphasize Sharon's consistent pattern of insubordination and deception toward civilian leadership. His misleading of the cabinet about the Lebanon War represented a fundamental violation of democratic norms, and his frequent disregard for orders during his military career suggested a dangerous belief that he alone knew what was best for Israel, regardless of what elected leaders decided.[^52]

Psychological critics have portrayed Sharon as driven by personal trauma and a need for control that made him incapable of empathy for Palestinian suffering or appreciation for the costs of his policies. The deaths of his first wife and son, in this interpretation, created emotional armor that prevented him from seeing Palestinians as human beings with legitimate claims and grievances.[^53]
