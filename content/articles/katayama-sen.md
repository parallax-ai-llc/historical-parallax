## Summary

Sen Katayama (1859-1933) was a pioneering Japanese labor organizer, socialist activist, and communist revolutionary who founded Japan's first settlement house, trade union movement, labor newspaper, and socialist party.[^1] Born as Yabuki Sugataro to a peasant family in Okayama Prefecture, he became one of the most significant figures in early Asian socialism after studying in the United States and absorbing Christian social gospel teachings and Marxist theory.[^2] His historic handshake with Russian socialist Georgy Plekhanov at the 1904 Amsterdam Congress during the Russo-Japanese War symbolized international working-class solidarity.[^3] After decades of activism spanning Japan, America, and eventually the Soviet Union, Katayama died in Moscow in 1933, receiving the honor of burial in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis with Stalin serving as a pallbearer.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Sen Katayama was born on December 26, 1859, as Yabuki Sugataro in the village of Hadegi, Mimasaka Province (now part of Iuge, Kumicho District, Okayama Prefecture).[^5] He was the second son of Kunizo and Kichi Yabuki, born into a peasant family during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate.[^6] His father, an adopted son himself, left the locally prominent Yabuki family four years after Katayama's birth to become a Buddhist monk, creating significant hardship for the young family.[^7]

Growing up in rural poverty, Katayama worked on farms while studying at home with only brief intervals of formal schooling.[^8] Despite these limitations, he acquired a classical Confucian education in Okayama, which instilled in him an idealistic worldview that would later blend with his socialist convictions.[^9] This Confucian idealism, given a populist twist by his peasant background, gave him an unshakable faith in individual and social perfectibility that would shape his entire career.[^10]

At age eighteen, to avoid conscription into the Imperial Japanese Army, Katayama was nominally adopted into the peasant household of Ikutaro Katayama, thereby obtaining his permanent name of Sen Katayama and becoming the first son of the Katayama family.[^11] This strategic adoption allowed him to pursue his education rather than military service, a decision that would prove transformative for both his life and Japan's labor movement.

In 1878, at age nineteen, Katayama traveled to Tokyo to apprentice as a printer while studying at Oka-Juku, a small preparatory school.[^12] He arrived in the capital at the height of the Freedom and People's Rights Movement (*Jiyū Minken Undō*), which called on the emperor to increase citizens' rights, establish an elected legislature, and reduce taxes.[^13] This political ferment had a foundational influence on his early political views. Working in a printing plant ten hours a day at 7½ cents daily, he could earn $2.50 a month by working overtime.[^14] At Oka-Juku, he formed a crucial friendship with Iwasaki Kiyoshichi, nephew of one of the founders of the Mitsubishi zaibatsu.[^15] When Iwasaki departed for Yale University, Katayama was inspired to pursue education in America himself.

## Journey to America and Intellectual Formation

In 1884, at age twenty-five, Katayama embarked on the journey that would transform him from a printer's apprentice into an international revolutionary.[^16] He arrived in California with only one dollar to his name, beginning what would be a twelve-year sojourn in the United States.[^17] This period of education and exposure to American labor movements, Christian social reform, and socialist thought fundamentally shaped his worldview and gave him the tools to revolutionize Japanese labor organizing upon his return.

Katayama's American education was remarkably diverse and thorough. After working odd jobs for over a year, he attended Hopkins Academy before enrolling at Maryville College in Maryville, Tennessee.[^18] He subsequently attended Grinnell College (then known as Iowa College) in Iowa, graduating in 1892.[^19] The Grinnell College Libraries still preserve his master's thesis and correspondence from 1895-1898, documenting this formative period.[^20] After graduation, Katayama proceeded to Andover Theological Seminary and then to Yale Divinity School, immersing himself in theological studies and the Social Gospel movement.[^21]

During this American period, Katayama became both a Christian and a socialist, synthesizing religious ethics with radical politics in a way that would characterize his early activism.[^22] The Social Gospel movement, which emphasized Christian duty to address social injustice, poverty, and labor exploitation, resonated deeply with his Confucian ethical background and peasant-class origins.[^23] He absorbed ideas about settlement houses, labor organizing, and social reform that were circulating among progressive Christian circles in the United States during the 1880s and 1890s.

One enduring friendship from this period was with Seishichi Iwasaki of the Mitsubishi zaibatsu, who tolerated his friend's increasingly radical views and repeatedly rescued him from debt, even serving as matchmaker when Katayama married in 1897.[^24] This relationship demonstrated Katayama's ability to maintain personal connections across class lines while pursuing revolutionary politics—a skill that would prove valuable throughout his career.

## Founding Japan's Labor Movement

In 1896, roused by socialism and the burgeoning labor movement, Katayama returned to Japan after twelve years abroad, determined to apply what he had learned in America to transform Japanese society.[^25] He immediately began working at Kingsley Hall, a Congregationalist settlement house he helped establish in the Kanda area of Tokyo in 1897—the first settlement house in Japan.[^26] Modeled after settlement houses he had observed in American cities, Kingsley Hall provided social services, education, and meeting space for working-class families while serving as a base for organizing labor activism.[^27]

Through Kingsley Hall, Katayama came into contact with Japan's incipient labor union movement at a critical moment in the country's industrialization.[^28] On December 1, 1897, the Iron Workers' Union was organized in Tokyo with over one thousand members, and on the same day, Katayama published the first issue of *Rōdō Sekai* (Labor World), the first labor newspaper in Japan.[^29] As one of the secretaries of the Iron Workers' Union and editor of Labor World, Katayama occupied a central position in Japan's emerging labor movement.[^30]

*Labor World* ran from December 1, 1897, to December 21, 1901, producing exactly one hundred issues before being enlarged to a daily on January 1, 1902.[^31] The newspaper served as the sole organ of the labor movement during this foundational period, covering strikes, working conditions, union organizing, and socialist theory.[^32] Innovatively, it contained one full page of labor news in English for the benefit of foreign exchanges, demonstrating Katayama's international orientation and his desire to connect Japanese workers with global labor movements.[^33]

From 1897 to 1901, Katayama edited *Labor World* as the organ of the Iron Workers' Union and the Trade Unions' Federation, establishing himself as Japan's preeminent labor journalist and organizer.[^34] His 1918 book *The Labor Movement in Japan*, covering the years 1897 to 1912, endures as a classic firsthand documentation of Japan's dynamic labor struggles and radical political movements in the early twentieth century.[^35] Modern scholars note that this work is probably cited more often than any other book on Japanese labor in the Meiji Period, though they caution it should not be read uncritically.[^36]

## Formation of Japan's First Socialist Party

On May 18, 1901, Katayama and fellow activists founded the Social Democratic Party (*Shakai Minshutō*), Japan's first socialist party.[^37] The party's founders included Kinoshita Naoe, Kiyoshi Kawakami, Kōnirō Nishikawa, Sen Katayama, Abe Isoo, and Kōtoku Shūsui—a mix of Christian socialists like Katayama and atheists like Kotoku.[^38] Though the party had a mild, pacifistic platform, it was immediately dissolved by the authorities.[^39]

When composing the platform, the founders took the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) as their reference, following an internationalist spirit in their Basic Program.[^40] The party advocated an eight-article "program of ideals," including the equality of humankind, total disarmament, and the public ownership of land and capital.[^41] It also advanced a twenty-eight article "program of action" advocating the abolition of the House of Peers, the establishment of universal suffrage, and the elimination of the Public Peace Police Law.[^42]

Despite its moderate reformist character, the Japanese government banned the party after only one day of existence, viewing any organized socialist movement as a threat to the imperial order.[^43] This immediate suppression demonstrated the severe constraints under which Japanese socialists operated and foreshadowed the increasingly harsh repression they would face in subsequent years.

The Social Democratic Party's brief existence revealed emerging factional divisions that would shape Japanese socialism for decades. The radical element was led by Kōtoku Shūsui, an anarcho-syndicalist who favored direct action and strikes, while the moderates were led by Sen Katayama and Tatsuji Tazoe, who favored a mild program of social reform.[^44] These tensions between revolutionary and reformist approaches, between anarchism and parliamentary socialism, would continue to fracture the Japanese left throughout Katayama's career.

---

## International Socialist Congress and Anti-War Activism

Katayama's most iconic moment came at the Sixth Congress of the Second International held in Amsterdam in 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).[^45] As Japan's representative to the congress, Katayama was nominated as the first vice-president, while the famous Russian Marxist Georgy Plekhanov served as second vice-president.[^46] In a dramatic gesture witnessed by delegates from across the world, Katayama and Plekhanov arose during the chairman's speech and publicly shook hands—a powerful symbol of international proletarian solidarity transcending the imperialist war being waged between their nations.[^47]

This handshake became one of the most famous symbolic moments in early international socialist history, demonstrating that workers' solidarity could overcome nationalist antagonism and imperialist conflict.[^48] It was an apt demonstration to those attending of the success of socialist internationalism and a vivid repudiation of the militarism and patriotism that were driving the Russo-Japanese War.[^49]

The anti-war stance of Japanese socialists during this period was uncompromising and principled. In March 1904, Japanese socialists sent a greeting to their Russian comrades containing powerful language about international solidarity: "Your enemy is not the Japanese people but our militarism and so-called patriotism. Nor is our enemy the Russian people, but your militarism and so-called patriotism. Patriotism and militarism are our common enemies."[^50] This message, almost certainly influenced by Katayama's thinking, articulated a revolutionary internationalist position that prioritized class solidarity over national allegiance.

During his trip to the United States in 1903, Katayama also attended the National Socialist Party Convention in Chicago, and American comrades remembered his addressing the Socialist picnic in Milwaukee in 1904.[^51] From February 1904 to January 1907, he lived and worked in Texas most of the time, where his main business became rice growing.[^52] However, his rice farming venture ultimately failed when his crop didn't succeed, and his "Nippon Kono Kabushiki-gaisha" (Japan Farming Company), formed with borrowed funds, quickly dissolved—reportedly over his socialist leanings, as Japanese farmers at Garwood disapproved of his attending socialist conventions.[^53]

---

## Tokyo Streetcar Strike and Exile

Returning to Japan, Katayama encountered increasingly severe governmental suppression of the socialist movement.[^54] The nadir came with the "high treason trial" of 1910-1911, which culminated in the precipitate execution of his former comrade Kōtoku Shūsui and eleven others on fabricated charges of plotting to assassinate the emperor.[^55] After only sixteen trials, all twenty-six accused radicals were demanded the death penalty; in the end, twelve people including Kotoku were sentenced to death in 1911.[^56] This state terror devastated Japan's radical movement and profoundly affected Katayama.

Katayama's own direct confrontation with state repression came through his participation in the Tokyo Streetcar Strike of 1911-1912.[^57] The strike began on December 31, 1911, and lasted until January 4, 1912, involving six thousand engineers and conductors who left the city of two million without a single streetcar running during the busiest days of the year.[^58] The strikers achieved a remarkable victory, extracting one hundred thousand dollars as a bonus from the streetcar company—considered the greatest sort of victory for labor at that time.[^59]

However, victory came at a severe cost. As soon as the strike was settled, authorities arrested one after another of the strike leaders; in all, sixty persons were detained.[^60] On January 15, 1912, five of the leaders, including Katayama, were arrested and brought to the Tokyo local court, examined, and sent to prison on charges of inciting workers to strike.[^61] Three of them were tried and condemned to prison, remaining imprisoned for nine months.[^62]

After his release from prison in 1913, Katayama felt forced to leave Japan in 1914, beginning a twenty-year exile that would take him through America, Mexico, and eventually the Soviet Union.[^63] He would never return to his homeland. In California, he endured hand-to-mouth poverty and suffered the pain of divorce by his wife, who had remained in Japan with two of their three children; he had brought only the older daughter to America.[^64]

---

## American Communist Party and Bolshevik Revolution

In America again, enduring severe poverty, Katayama played the crucial role of interpreter of Japanese developments to politically curious but ill-informed American socialists.[^65] In October 1916, he was invited to New York by the Dutch socialist S.J. Rutgers, where he met Aleksandra Kollontai, Nikolai Bukharin, and Leon Trotsky.[^66] These connections would prove transformative.

During Trotsky's arrival in New York on January 13, 1917, around twenty members and supporters of the Socialist Party's anti-war left-wing met with him, including Bukharin, Alexandra Kollontai, Sen Katayama, and Louis Fraina.[^67] Katayama later wrote that they intended to organize the Left-Wing under Trotsky's direction, with Kollontai, who was going to Europe, establishing a link between the European and American Left-Wing movements.[^68] During this period, these prominent revolutionaries collaborated on publishing *Novy Mir* (New World), a Russian-language socialist newspaper that served as an important hub for revolutionary internationalist politics before many participants returned to Russia for the Revolution.[^69]

Katayama and Kotoku had earlier come to the United States and initiated the first socialist group among the Japanese working class, establishing a Japanese socialist association in San Francisco.[^70] During the 1910s, however, socialist activity among Japanese immigrants remained minimal, with a small monthly paper called *Heimin*, published by Sen Katayama, being the notable exception.[^71]

Attracted by the success of the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917-1918, Katayama became an active communist and abandoned the reformist socialism of his earlier years.[^72] He was one of the original members of the American Communist Party, founded in 1919, and was appointed head of the Comintern's Pan-American Agency.[^73] His evolution from Christian socialist to revolutionary communist reflected broader transformations within international socialism following the cataclysm of World War I and the apparent vindication of Leninist revolutionary strategy in Russia.

---

## Comintern Leadership and Asian Revolution

In 1921, Katayama was elected as an executive member of the Communist International (Comintern), marking his ascent to the highest levels of international communist leadership.[^74] He became an Executive Committee member of the Comintern in 1922, one of the few Asians to hold such a prominent position.[^75] Katayama was selected as an honorary chairman at the First Congress of the Toiler of the Far East, alongside Lenin, Trotsky, Grigory Zinoviev, and Stalin—a remarkable recognition of his stature.[^76]

In January 1922, Katayama was informed by the Communist International that the First Congress of the Toiler of the Far East would be held on January 21, 1922, in Irkutsk.[^77] It was only after this congress, attended by delegates of the Japanese Party, that a direct connection was established between the Communist International and the Japanese Communist movement.[^78] Katayama played a crucial liaison role between the Comintern and Asian revolutionary movements.

He was co-founder, in 1922, of the Japanese Communist Party, though his direct involvement was limited by his exile and the party's clandestine status in Japan.[^79] In December 1922, Katayama delivered a report on the Eastern Question to the Comintern, stating: "Japan occupies a very important place as to the coming socialist revolution. Japan is the only country which is really economically and politically independent in the Far East."[^80] This assessment reflected his understanding of Japan's unique position as an advanced capitalist power in Asia and its strategic importance for communist revolution.

The last eleven years of Katayama's life were spent serving the Comintern in Moscow as one of the few Asians with a well-known revolutionary past.[^81] He traveled abroad again only briefly, to China in 1924, but otherwise remained in the Soviet Union working on Asian revolutionary strategy.[^82] His work focused particularly on promoting communist movements in East Asia and serving as a liaison between the international communist movement and Asian revolutionary groups.[^83]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revolutionary dedication, Katayama's work attracted significant criticisms, particularly regarding his theoretical frameworks and practical effectiveness. His ideological commitment to Marxism-Leninism drew criticism for its dogmatic rigidity and disconnection from Japan's socio-cultural context.[^84] The approach reflected in the 1922 "Theses on Japan," which he supported, insisted on ultra-left tactics like boycotting elections and forming clandestine cells, alienating broader socialist elements and fostering internal factionalism.[^85]

Critics noted that such positions overlooked empirical evidence of Japan's evolving parliamentary system under the Taishō democracy, where moderate labor reforms gained traction, rendering revolutionary absolutism impractical for building mass support.[^86] Katayama's theoretical framework remained eclectic, blending residual Christian socialist ethics with Bolshevik militancy, without deep dialectical analysis of Japan's semi-feudal agrarian base or emperor-centric nationalism.[^87] This ideological hybridity, while reflecting his complex intellectual journey, created strategic confusion about appropriate revolutionary tactics for Japan.

His business failures also revealed practical limitations. Beyond the failed rice farming venture in Texas, the Japan Farming Company he formed dissolved not only due to crop failure but also because of disapproval from Japanese farmers regarding his political activities.[^88] These failures contributed to the severe poverty he endured during parts of his American exile, straining both his personal life and his political work.

Toward the end of his life, Katayama became discouraged at the lack of success of the Communist movement in his own homeland.[^89] His knowledge of the Japanese Communist movement became increasingly vicarious as he remained in Moscow, and he had a weak base inside Japan, where he was little known compared to his international prominence.[^90] The Japanese Communist Party he helped found faced relentless state repression, limiting its effectiveness and preventing the revolutionary breakthrough Katayama hoped to see.

His personal life suffered greatly from his political commitments. After being imprisoned for the streetcar strike, he left Japan permanently, and during his difficult California period, his wife divorced him, keeping two of their three children in Japan while he brought only the older daughter to America.[^91] This family rupture illustrated the personal costs of his revolutionary dedication and the difficulty of maintaining family relationships across vast distances while enduring poverty and political exile.

---

## Personal Life

Sen Katayama married twice during his lifetime, and both marriages were profoundly affected by his political activism and frequent relocations.[^92] His first wife was Fude, with whom he had two children.[^93] Fude died in 1903, leaving Katayama to raise their children while pursuing his labor organizing and political work.[^94] His lifelong friend Seishichi Iwasaki of the Mitsubishi zaibatsu served as matchmaker for this marriage in 1897, demonstrating the cross-class personal connections Katayama maintained despite his radical politics.[^95]

Katayama married his second wife, Hari Tama, in 1907, and they had one daughter together.[^96] However, this marriage deteriorated under the strain of his political activities, imprisonment, and eventual exile. After settling in California following his release from prison and departure from Japan, Katayama suffered from extreme poverty.[^97] His wife, who remained in Japan with two of their three children, divorced him during this difficult period.[^98] He endured the divorce while living in hand-to-mouth poverty in America, having brought only the older daughter with him.[^99]

Across both marriages, Katayama had a total of three children, but his relationship with them was severely constrained by his political commitments and extended absences.[^100] The divorce and family separation represented one of the most painful personal costs of his revolutionary dedication, as he was separated from two of his children for the final two decades of his life while he worked for the communist movement in America and later the Soviet Union.

Despite these family difficulties, Katayama maintained some important personal relationships. His friendship with Seishichi Iwasaki of Mitsubishi endured throughout his life, with Iwasaki tolerating his friend's increasingly radical views, repeatedly rescuing him from debt, and maintaining contact despite their vastly different social positions.[^101] This friendship demonstrated Katayama's personal warmth and ability to sustain human connections across ideological and class divides.

Katayama's personality blended Confucian ethical idealism with Christian social gospel principles and revolutionary Marxist commitment.[^102] Colleagues described his unshakable faith in individual and social perfectibility—a belief rooted in his Confucian education but channeled through his Christian conversion and socialist convictions.[^103] This optimistic faith in human progress sustained him through imprisonment, poverty, exile, and the repeated failures and defeats of the movements he championed.

## Legacy

Sen Katayama died on November 5, 1933, in Moscow, where he had spent the last eleven years of his life serving the Communist International.[^104] His death was met with extraordinary honors from the Soviet leadership. His bier was borne by Stalin and other high-ranking dignitaries, with Stalin personally serving as a pallbearer.[^105] He received the rare honor of burial in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Red Square, where only the most venerated revolutionary figures were interred, alongside foreign communists such as John Reed and Clara Zetkin.[^106]

After his death, Katayama was commemorated by the Soviet Union as a staunch internationalist and revolutionary, symbolizing the global reach of communist revolution and the particular importance of Asia in the Comintern's strategy.[^107] However, today Katayama receives little glory or remembrance from the contemporary left, and despite being one of communism's forgotten men, he has left a lasting legacy on the Japanese left and Asian radical traditions.[^108]

Katayama is recognized as a founding figure in the Asian and Asian-American radical traditions, pioneering the introduction of organized socialism and labor unionism to Japan during a critical period of industrialization and social transformation.[^109] He founded Japan's first modern settlement house, trade union movement, labor newspaper, and socialist party—achievements that fundamentally shaped the trajectory of Japanese social movements.[^110] His 1918 book *The Labor Movement in Japan* endures as essential documentation of this foundational period, though modern scholars emphasize it should be read with critical contextualization.[^111]

Katayama Sen's biography exemplifies the transnational nature of revolutionary movements in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.[^112] His journey took him from a peasant village in Okayama to universities in America, settlement houses in Tokyo, socialist congresses in Amsterdam, exile in California, revolutionary organizing in New York, and finally to leadership in the Comintern in Moscow. This extraordinary trajectory illustrates how revolutionary ideas and movements crossed national boundaries, with activists like Katayama serving as crucial conduits for the international circulation of socialist theory and practice.

His legacy in Japan itself remains contested and partially obscured. The Japanese Communist Party he helped found in 1922 has continued to exist, becoming one of the longest-running communist parties in Asia, though it has long since abandoned revolutionary positions in favor of parliamentary politics.[^113] Whether Katayama would recognize or approve of its current incarnation remains an open question, given the dramatic transformations Japanese communism has undergone.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly admirers emphasize Katayama's pioneering role in introducing modern labor organization and socialist politics to Japan, viewing him as an indispensable figure in Japanese social history.[^114] Hyman Kublin's 1964 biography *Asian Revolutionary: The Life of Sen Katayama* is described as accurate, rounded, and fascinatingly written, establishing Katayama as a major figure deserving serious historical attention.[^115] Kublin and other scholars highlight how Katayama synthesized diverse intellectual influences—Confucian ethics, Christian social gospel, American progressivism, and Marxist theory—into a distinctive approach to social transformation.

Contemporary socialist publications like *New Socialist* celebrate Katayama as a "pioneer, internationalist, and revolutionary" whose life demonstrated the possibility of authentic international working-class solidarity transcending national boundaries and imperial conflicts.[^116] His 1904 handshake with Plekhanov is frequently cited as one of the most powerful symbolic moments in early socialist internationalism, demonstrating principled opposition to imperialist war decades before the more famous socialist anti-war movements of World War I.[^117]

Supporters also emphasize his practical achievements in building institutions—Kingsley Hall settlement house, the Iron Workers' Union, *Labor World* newspaper, and the Social Democratic Party—that created infrastructure for Japan's labor movement and left-wing politics.[^118] These concrete organizational accomplishments, they argue, had lasting impacts that survived the repression of individual movements and leaders. Modern Japanese labor historians acknowledge that Katayama's early organizing work laid foundations that subsequent generations built upon, even when they rejected his later communist politics.

His role in the Comintern is viewed positively by scholars of international communism, who note that he provided crucial knowledge about Asian conditions and represented non-European revolutionary movements in an organization dominated by European parties.[^119] His reports and writings helped orient the Comintern toward understanding Japan's unique position as an advanced capitalist power in Asia and the specific challenges and opportunities this presented for revolutionary strategy.[^120]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Katayama's theoretical contributions were limited and derivative, never developing an original Marxist analysis suited to Japanese conditions.[^121] His framework remained eclectic and inconsistent, blending Christian socialist ethics with Bolshevik revolutionary rhetoric without achieving a coherent synthesis or deep engagement with Japanese social structure, emperor-centric nationalism, or semi-feudal agrarian conditions.[^122] This theoretical weakness, critics contend, contributed to strategic errors that hampered the Japanese communist movement.

The ultra-left positions reflected in the 1922 Comintern "Theses on Japan," which Katayama supported, are viewed as disastrous by many historians of Japanese communism.[^123] These theses advocated boycotting elections and forming clandestine revolutionary cells precisely when Japan's Taishō democracy was expanding parliamentary space and moderate labor reforms were gaining traction.[^124] This sectarian approach alienated potential allies, fostered destructive factionalism, and made the communist movement vulnerable to state repression by isolating it from broader social forces.[^125]

Some scholars emphasize Katayama's diminishing relevance to actual conditions in Japan as he remained in exile for the final two decades of his life.[^126] Based in America and later Moscow, his knowledge of the Japanese communist movement became increasingly vicarious and outdated.[^127] He had a weak base inside Japan and was little known there compared to his international prominence, limiting his practical influence on the movements he nominally led.[^128] Critics suggest that Katayama became more symbol than substantive leader—valuable to the Comintern for propaganda purposes but disconnected from the realities of revolutionary organizing in Japan.

His personal failures—failed business ventures, family dissolution, periods of severe poverty—are sometimes interpreted not merely as personal misfortunes but as indicators of impractical idealism and poor judgment.[^129] Critics note that his inability to sustain economic self-sufficiency created dependence on wealthy friends like Iwasaki and later on Comintern support, potentially compromising his independence and reinforcing his tendency toward dogmatic adherence to official communist positions.

Japanese nationalist and conservative historians view Katayama more harshly, portraying him as a traitor who betrayed his country by opposing the Russo-Japanese War, collaborating with foreign revolutionary movements, and ultimately serving Soviet interests rather than Japanese national welfare.[^130] From this perspective, his burial in the Kremlin wall symbolizes his alienation from Japan and subordination to international communism rather than honor for his contributions.
