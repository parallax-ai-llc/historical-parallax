## Summary

David MacMillan is a British-American chemist who shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Benjamin List for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis. He coined the term 'organocatalysis' and demonstrated that small organic molecules can catalyze reactions with high enantioselectivity. His work has broad applications in pharmaceutical synthesis and green chemistry.
