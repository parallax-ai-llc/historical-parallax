## Summary

Charlotte Brontë was an English novelist and poet who became one of the most celebrated writers of the Victorian era. Born in 1816 in Thornton, Yorkshire, she is best known for her groundbreaking novel *Jane Eyre* (1847), which challenged contemporary attitudes toward class, gender, and morality. Along with her sisters Emily and Anne, Charlotte formed part of the legendary Brontë literary family, writing under the male pseudonym "Currer Bell" to circumvent gender prejudice in publishing. Despite a short life marked by tragedy and illness, her passionate, psychologically complex narratives revolutionized the English novel and established her as a pioneer of feminist literature. She died in 1855 at age 38, likely from complications of pregnancy, leaving behind a literary legacy that continues to influence writers and readers worldwide.

## Early Life and Background

Charlotte Brontë was born on April 21, 1816, in Thornton, West Yorkshire, England, the third of six children born to Patrick Brontë, an Irish Anglican clergyman, and Maria Branwell Brontë.[^1] The family moved to Haworth in 1820, where Patrick had been appointed perpetual curate, and where the children would spend most of their formative years in the austere parsonage overlooking the Yorkshire moors.[^2] Tragedy struck early when Charlotte's mother died of cancer in September 1821, leaving the six children—Maria, Elizabeth, Charlotte, Branwell, Emily, and Anne—in the care of their father and their aunt, Elizabeth Branwell, who moved in to help raise them.[^3]

In 1824, Charlotte and her older sisters Maria and Elizabeth were sent to the Clergy Daughters' School at Cowan Bridge in Lancashire, a charitable institution for the daughters of impoverished clergy.[^4] The school's harsh conditions, poor food, and unsanitary environment had devastating consequences: Maria and Elizabeth contracted tuberculosis and were sent home, where they died in 1825, Maria at age 11 and Elizabeth at age 10.[^5] This traumatic experience would later be immortalized in Charlotte's depiction of Lowood School in *Jane Eyre*. Charlotte and Emily were withdrawn from the school following their sisters' deaths.[^6]

The surviving Brontë children grew up in relative isolation at Haworth Parsonage, where they developed extraordinarily rich imaginative lives.[^7] Their father encouraged reading and education, providing them with access to literature, periodicals, and current events. In 1826, Patrick brought home a set of toy soldiers for Branwell, which sparked the creation of elaborate fantasy worlds that the children chronicled in microscopic handwritten manuscripts.[^8] Charlotte and Branwell created the imaginary African kingdom of Angria, while Emily and Anne developed the Pacific island nation of Gondal. These juvenile writings, thousands of pages in total, allowed Charlotte to develop her narrative skills and explore themes of passion, power, and ambition that would later characterize her mature work.[^9]

Charlotte received formal education at Roe Head School in Mirfield from 1831 to 1832, where she formed lasting friendships with Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor, who would become important correspondents and sources of support throughout her life.[^10] She returned to Roe Head as a teacher from 1835 to 1838, bringing Emily and later Anne along as pupils in exchange for Charlotte's teaching services.[^11] However, the experience of teaching proved difficult for Charlotte, who struggled with depression and the demands of managing unruly pupils while longing for time to write.[^12]

## Rise to Prominence

Charlotte's path to literary recognition was marked by persistence in the face of repeated rejection and the constraints imposed on women writers in Victorian England. After various unsuccessful attempts at establishing a school and working as a governess—positions she found degrading and restrictive—Charlotte conceived a plan to improve her qualifications by studying abroad.[^13] In 1842, she and Emily traveled to Brussels to study at the Pensionnat Héger, a school run by Constantin Héger and his wife.[^14] Charlotte fell deeply in love with Monsieur Héger, a married man, and though the attachment was unrequited, it profoundly influenced her emotional and creative development.[^15] This experience would later inform her novels *The Professor* and *Villette*.

Returning to Haworth in 1844, Charlotte discovered Emily's poetry and conceived the idea of publishing a joint collection of verse by the three sisters.[^16] In 1846, using their carefully saved money and the pseudonyms Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, they published *Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell*. The volume sold only two copies but received some positive critical notices.[^17] Undeterred, the sisters turned their attention to prose fiction, each writing a novel: Charlotte's *The Professor*, Emily's *Wuthering Heights*, and Anne's *Agnes Grey*.

While *The Professor* was rejected by multiple publishers, Charlotte began work on *Jane Eyre* in 1846, completing it in less than a year.[^18] The manuscript was accepted by Smith, Elder & Co., and published in October 1847 under the pseudonym Currer Bell.[^19] The novel was an immediate sensation, praised for its passionate intensity, psychological depth, and revolutionary treatment of a female protagonist who asserted her moral and spiritual equality with men.[^20] The first edition sold out quickly, and the novel was reprinted multiple times within the first year. Reviewers debated whether Currer Bell was male or female, with many finding it impossible that a woman could have written such a powerful and unconventional work.[^21]

The triumph of *Jane Eyre* was soon overshadowed by devastating personal losses. Branwell died in September 1848, followed by Emily in December 1848 and Anne in May 1849, all from tuberculosis.[^22] Charlotte was left alone with her aging father, grieving intensely while trying to continue her literary career. Despite her sorrow, she completed *Shirley* in 1849, a novel set against the backdrop of the Luddite uprisings in Yorkshire, which received mixed reviews.[^23]

Charlotte's literary reputation brought her into contact with prominent figures in London's literary world, including William Makepeace Thackeray, Elizabeth Gaskell, and Harriet Martineau.[^24] Her identity as Currer Bell was eventually revealed, and she made several visits to London, though she found the attention both gratifying and overwhelming.[^25] In 1853, she published *Villette*, a psychologically intense novel based partly on her Brussels experience, which many critics consider her masterpiece.[^26]

## Major Achievements

Charlotte Brontë's primary achievement lies in her revolutionary contribution to the English novel, particularly in her creation of complex, morally autonomous female protagonists who challenged Victorian conventions about women's roles and capabilities. *Jane Eyre* fundamentally transformed the possibilities of female characterization in literature, presenting a heroine who was neither beautiful nor wealthy but possessed fierce intelligence, moral conviction, and passionate feeling.[^27] The novel's famous declaration—"I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will"—articulated a vision of female selfhood that resonated far beyond its Victorian context.[^28]

The novel pioneered the use of first-person narration to explore female consciousness with unprecedented psychological depth and honesty.[^29] Charlotte's rendering of Jane's interior life, including her anger, desire, and spiritual struggles, broke new ground in representing women's subjective experience. The bildungsroman structure, following Jane from abused orphan to independent woman, created a template for countless later novels of female development.[^30] Moreover, the novel's engagement with questions of class, religion, and colonialism (particularly through the figure of Bertha Mason, Rochester's first wife) has made it a continually relevant text for literary and cultural analysis.[^31]

Charlotte's other novels each made distinctive contributions to Victorian literature. *Shirley* (1849) was unusual in addressing industrial unrest and featuring a strong, unconventional female protagonist who refused conventional femininity.[^32] The novel also contains one of the first extended treatments of female friendship in English fiction and explores the limited options available to educated women in provincial society.[^33] *Villette* (1853), Charlotte's final completed novel, is considered by many scholars to be her most sophisticated work, featuring an unreliable narrator and a more experimental approach to narrative structure.[^34] Its exploration of depression, loneliness, and the construction of identity influenced later modernist writers.[^35]

Beyond her novels, Charlotte's extensive correspondence provides invaluable insight into Victorian literary culture, women's education, and the daily realities of a professional woman writer.[^36] Her letters to Ellen Nussey, W.S. Williams (her publisher's reader), and others reveal her sharp critical intelligence, her struggles with depression and grief, and her evolving understanding of her vocation as a writer.[^37] These letters have become important primary sources for understanding both the Brontë family and Victorian literary life more broadly.

Charlotte also played a crucial role in preserving and promoting her sisters' literary legacies. After Emily's and Anne's deaths, she edited new editions of *Wuthering Heights* and *Agnes Grey*, writing biographical notices that, while somewhat misrepresenting her sisters' characters (particularly Emily's), helped establish their posthumous reputations.[^38] She also selected and published additional poems by Emily and Anne.[^39]

Her courage in pursuing publication under difficult circumstances—using a pseudonym to evade gender prejudice while maintaining artistic integrity—demonstrated the possibility of professional authorship for women.[^40] Charlotte corresponded with her publishers on business terms, negotiated contracts, and took an active role in decisions about reprints, illustrations, and editorial matters, modeling a form of professional authorship that would influence subsequent generations of women writers.[^41]

The Brontë juvenilia, those thousands of pages of microscopic manuscripts chronicling the fantasy worlds of Angria and Gondal, represent another significant achievement, though one not recognized until the twentieth century.[^42] These writings demonstrate an extraordinary imaginative development and provide unparalleled insight into the genesis of literary creativity.[^43] Scholars have traced how themes, characters, and narrative strategies from the juvenile writings evolved into the mature novels, revealing Charlotte's artistic development over nearly two decades.[^44]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Charlotte Brontë's works generated significant controversy during her lifetime, with critics often scandalized by what they perceived as coarseness, impropriety, and dangerous challenges to social order. *Jane Eyre* was attacked for its supposed immorality and anti-Christian sentiment.[^45] Elizabeth Rigby's infamous 1848 review in the *Quarterly Review* condemned the novel as "pre-eminently an anti-Christian composition" and found in it "that pervading tone of ungodly discontent" which, if written by a woman, suggested one "who has long forfeited the society of her own sex."[^46] Such reviews reflected deep anxiety about the novel's challenge to class hierarchies and gender norms, particularly Jane's assertion of equality with her employer and eventual husband, Rochester.

Modern critics have identified problematic elements in Charlotte's work, particularly regarding race and colonialism. The treatment of Bertha Mason in *Jane Eyre*—Rochester's Creole first wife, locked in the attic and depicted as bestial and mad—has been extensively criticized as racist and participating in colonialist discourse.[^47] Postcolonial scholars, most famously Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak and Jean Rhys (whose novel *Wide Sargasso Sea* rewrites Bertha's story), have argued that Jane's feminist independence is built upon the silencing and dehumanization of the colonial other.[^48] The novel's equation of Bertha's West Indian background with moral and mental degeneracy reflects Victorian racial prejudices that Charlotte apparently shared.[^49]

Charlotte's editorial handling of her sisters' works after their deaths has been criticized for distorting their legacies. In her biographical notice to the 1850 edition of *Wuthering Heights* and *Agnes Grey*, Charlotte portrayed Emily as an unworldly, reclusive genius who hardly understood the violent passions she depicted, and Anne as a gentle, pious innocent.[^50] These characterizations, while partly motivated by a desire to defend her sisters against charges of coarseness, created misleading images that took decades to correct.[^51] Charlotte also made editorial changes to Emily's novel, attempting to "correct" its grammar and make it more conventionally acceptable, interventions now seen as misguided.[^52]

Some critics, both contemporary and modern, have found Charlotte's novels flawed by melodrama, improbable plotting, and excessive passion. The Gothic elements in *Jane Eyre*—the madwoman in the attic, Rochester's blinding, the telepathic communication between Jane and Rochester—have been seen as undermining the novel's realism.[^53] Charlotte's prose style, with its heightened rhetoric and emotional intensity, has been considered overwrought by some readers who prefer more restrained narrative approaches.[^54]

Charlotte's own social and religious conservatism created tensions in her work. Despite creating feminist heroines, she expressed disapproval of the women's rights movement and believed women were naturally subordinate to men in some respects.[^55] Her novels, while challenging certain gendered restrictions, ultimately tend to resolve with conventional marriages that contain female autonomy within domestic bounds.[^56] Her attitude toward the working class was often paternalistic, and her support for the poor was rooted in Christian duty rather than political radicalism.[^57]

Her treatment of Catholicism in *Villette* has been criticized as displaying Protestant prejudice, with Catholic characters portrayed as manipulative and the Catholic church as oppressive.[^58] This reflected widespread anti-Catholic sentiment in Victorian England but limits the novel's religious perspective. Similarly, her depiction of Belgian characters in both *The Professor* and *Villette* has been seen as displaying ethnic stereotyping and English cultural superiority.[^59]

## Personal Life

Charlotte Brontë's personal life was marked by profound attachments, devastating losses, and a constant tension between her desire for connection and her need for independence and creative expression. She never attended a ball, theater, or concert until after the publication of *Jane Eyre*, and her social circle remained small throughout her life.[^60] Her closest relationships were with her siblings, particularly her sisters Emily and Anne, with whom she shared an intense creative and emotional bond.[^61]

Her romantic life included several unrequited attachments and proposals. Her passionate but one-sided love for Constantin Héger in Brussels (1842-1843) was one of the most significant emotional experiences of her life, leading to desperate letters that reveal her intense need for intellectual and emotional connection.[^62] After returning to England, she refused at least two marriage proposals: one from Henry Nussey (Ellen's brother) in 1839 and another from David Bryce, an Irish curate, in 1839.[^63] In 1851, she refused a proposal from James Taylor, a representative of her publishers, despite finding him intellectually compatible, because she could not overcome her physical aversion to him.[^64]

Her eventual marriage to Arthur Bell Nicholls, her father's curate, was itself controversial. Nicholls proposed in December 1852, but Patrick Brontë violently opposed the match, considering Nicholls socially and financially inferior.[^65] Charlotte initially refused Nicholls, but his evident devotion and her father's harsh treatment of him eventually won her sympathy.[^66] After a long engagement and her father's grudging consent, they married on June 29, 1854, when Charlotte was 38.[^67]

By most accounts, the marriage was happy, though brief. Charlotte found satisfaction in the companionship and the domestic role she had long criticized as insufficient for women's fulfillment.[^68] However, she also experienced the loss of privacy and writing time, noting that "my time is not my own now."[^69] She became pregnant in late 1854, but the pregnancy proved difficult. She suffered from severe nausea and weakness, likely hyperemesis gravidarum, and died on March 31, 1855, at age 38, probably from dehydration and malnutrition related to the condition, possibly complicated by tuberculosis or typhoid fever.[^70]

Physically, Charlotte was very small (barely five feet tall), and considered herself plain, a self-perception that deeply influenced her creation of the "small and plain" Jane Eyre.[^71] She suffered from poor eyesight, which may have contributed to her small, cramped handwriting in the juvenilia.[^72] Contemporary descriptions emphasize her large, expressive eyes and the animation of her features when she was engaged in conversation.[^73]

Charlotte struggled throughout her life with depression, which she called "hypochondria" in the Victorian manner.[^74] Her letters reveal periods of intense loneliness, particularly after her sisters' deaths, when she found herself isolated at Haworth with only her elderly father for company.[^75] Writing was both a compulsion and a therapeutic necessity, though she also found the public exposure that came with fame distressing.[^76]

Despite her limited social experience, Charlotte was intellectually curious and well-read, engaging with contemporary politics, social issues, and literature.[^77] Her friendship with Elizabeth Gaskell, who would later write her biography, was one of the most important of her later years, though the two women disagreed on various points, including Charlotte's harsh judgment of William Thackeray's personal life.[^78]

## Legacy

Charlotte Brontë's legacy as one of the most influential novelists in English literature is secure, with *Jane Eyre* remaining continuously in print since its publication and adapted countless times for stage, film, television, and other media.[^79] The novel has been translated into dozens of languages and is taught in schools and universities worldwide, introducing millions of readers to Charlotte's passionate, morally complex vision of female identity and autonomy.[^80]

Her influence on subsequent women writers has been profound and widely acknowledged. Novelists from George Eliot and Elizabeth Gaskell in the Victorian era to Jean Rhys, Margaret Drabble, and contemporary authors have cited Charlotte as an inspiration and model.[^81] Her demonstration that women's interior lives, professional struggles, and desire for independence were worthy subjects for serious literature helped legitimize female authorship and expand the range of themes available to women writers.[^82]

The Brontë cult that developed after Charlotte's death transformed Haworth Parsonage into one of England's most visited literary shrines, attracting pilgrims from around the world.[^83] The Brontë Parsonage Museum, established in 1928, preserves the family home and artifacts, contributing to the ongoing fascination with the Brontë sisters' lives and works.[^84] This romanticization of the Brontës has sometimes obscured their actual literary achievements, but it has also kept their works accessible to popular audiences.[^85]

Academically, Charlotte's work has generated an enormous body of scholarship across multiple critical approaches. Feminist critics have analyzed her representations of female autonomy, anger, and desire, with Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's *The Madwoman in the Attic* (1979) taking its title from *Jane Eyre* and making Charlotte central to their argument about nineteenth-century women's writing.[^86] Postcolonial critics have examined the racial and imperial dimensions of her work, while psychoanalytic critics have explored the psychological depths of her characters and narratives.[^87] Biographical critics continue to mine her life for insights into her work, while new historicists situate her novels within Victorian social, economic, and religious contexts.[^88]

The Brontë juvenilia, rediscovered and seriously studied in the twentieth century, have influenced understanding of creative development and childhood imagination.[^89] These microscopic manuscripts have become valuable artifacts, with major collections at the British Library, the Brontë Parsonage Museum, and other institutions.[^90]

Charlotte's example as a professional woman writer who negotiated the male-dominated publishing world on her own terms has made her an important figure in the history of women's economic independence.[^91] Despite using a pseudonym, she conducted business directly with her publishers, managed her own finances, and earned enough from her writing to achieve a degree of financial independence rare for unmarried Victorian women.[^92]

The ongoing reinterpretation of her works reflects their richness and complexity. *Jane Eyre* has been read as a feminist manifesto, a Christian allegory, a psychological novel, a critique of imperialism, and a romance, among other interpretations.[^93] Each generation finds new meanings in Charlotte's works, ensuring their continued relevance. Recent scholarly attention to disability studies, trauma theory, and affect theory has opened new approaches to understanding her representations of physical and psychological suffering.[^94]

Charlotte's influence extends beyond literature to popular culture, where she and her sisters have become iconic figures representing female creativity, sisterhood, and tragic genius.[^95] Films, plays, and novels about the Brontës continue to appear, demonstrating the ongoing fascination with their lives and work.[^96]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Charlotte Brontë is widely celebrated as a pioneering feminist writer who fundamentally changed representations of women in literature. Literary scholar Elaine Showalter argues that Charlotte "created a heroine who was the protagonist of her own life, not simply the object of male desire," establishing a new paradigm for women's fiction.[^97] Feminist critics have consistently praised her creation of heroines who assert their moral, intellectual, and spiritual equality with men, with Jane Eyre's declaration to Rochester—"Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?"—becoming an iconic statement of female dignity.[^98]

Scholars have lauded Charlotte's psychological realism and her pioneering exploration of female consciousness. Critic Robert B. Heilman wrote that "in Jane Eyre, Charlotte Brontë discovered a new dimension of reality—the inner life," arguing that her first-person narration created an unprecedented intimacy with a female character's thoughts and feelings.[^99] Literary historian Sally Shuttleworth has praised Charlotte's nuanced representations of mental states, including depression, rage, and desire, noting that her novels "map the inner landscape of female experience with extraordinary precision."[^100]

Many scholars emphasize Charlotte's courage and determination in pursuing a literary career despite enormous obstacles. Claire Harman, in her biography of Charlotte, celebrates her "extraordinary tenacity and professionalism," noting that she persisted through rejection, grief, and social isolation to achieve literary success.[^101] Her use of a male pseudonym is seen not as deception but as a pragmatic strategy to ensure her work received fair consideration in a male-dominated literary marketplace.[^102]

Charlotte's technical innovations have been widely recognized. Her use of Gothic elements within a realistic framework, her manipulation of reader sympathy through first-person narration, and her experimentation with narrative structure (particularly in *Villette*) have been praised as significant contributions to the development of the novel form.[^103] Literary critic Margaret Smith argues that Charlotte's narrative techniques influenced the development of the psychological novel and modernist fiction.[^104]

Her representation of female education and intellectual development has been celebrated by scholars of Victorian education and women's history. Charlotte's own experience as a student and teacher informed her critique of the inadequate educational opportunities available to women, and her novels advocate for women's right to intellectual development and meaningful work.[^105] Historian Joan N. Burstyn credits Charlotte with contributing to debates about women's education that eventually led to expanded opportunities.[^106]

Admirers have consistently praised the moral seriousness of Charlotte's work. Despite the passion and occasional melodrama of her novels, they engage deeply with ethical questions about duty, integrity, independence, and faith.[^107] Critic Robert Martin argues that "Charlotte's novels present a coherent moral vision in which individual integrity and social responsibility must be balanced," and that this ethical dimension gives her work lasting value.[^108]

Contemporary authors frequently acknowledge Charlotte's influence. Writer Margaret Atwood has called *Jane Eyre* "one of the most subversive books ever written," praising its challenge to Victorian social hierarchies.[^109] Novelist Tracy Chevalier credits Charlotte with demonstrating that "women's lives, women's perspectives, women's voices could be at the center of great literature."[^110]

### Negative Views

Charlotte Brontë has faced significant criticism, both in her time and subsequently, with detractors identifying various aesthetic, ideological, and moral failings in her work. Contemporary critics like Elizabeth Rigby attacked *Jane Eyre* for its supposed coarseness and immorality, criticisms that reflected anxiety about female authorship and challenges to class hierarchy but also identified what some readers perceived as genuine artistic flaws.[^111]

Modern scholars have mounted substantial critiques of Charlotte's treatment of race and empire. Postcolonial critic Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's influential essay "Three Women's Texts and a Critique of Imperialism" argues that *Jane Eyre's* feminism depends upon the "othering" and silencing of Bertha Mason, the Creole woman whose racial difference is associated with madness, sexuality, and violence.[^112] Susan Meyer's work demonstrates how Charlotte's novels encode Victorian racial anxieties and participate in imperialist discourse even while challenging gender hierarchies.[^113] These critics argue that Charlotte's progressive gender politics are compromised by her regressive racial politics.

Some scholars critique Charlotte's ultimate conservatism. Despite creating rebellious heroines, her novels typically end with conventional marriages that contain female independence within domestic bounds.[^114] Literary critic Penny Boumelha argues that Charlotte's radicalism is "limited and contradictory," noting that her heroines' assertions of equality ultimately serve to secure better marriages rather than to challenge the institution itself.[^115] Charlotte's own stated views on women's rights were often conservative, and she expressed disapproval of the organized women's movement.[^116]

Her religious views have been criticized from multiple perspectives. Some Victorian critics found her novels insufficiently Christian or even anti-Christian, while modern readers have criticized her Protestant prejudices, particularly the anti-Catholic elements in *Villette*.[^117] Literary scholar Robert Colby argues that Charlotte's religious views were "narrow and sectarian," limiting her ability to portray religious diversity fairly.[^118]

Aesthetically, some critics have found Charlotte's novels flawed by melodrama and improbable plotting. The Gothic elements in *Jane Eyre*—particularly Rochester's telepathic summons and the convenient inheritance Jane receives—have been criticized as undermining the novel's realism.[^119] Literary critic David Lodge argues that Charlotte's "reliance on coincidence and melodramatic device" weakens her novels' psychological realism.[^120]

Charlotte's prose style has been criticized as overheated and excessive. Where admirers see passion and intensity, detractors see purple prose and emotional self-indulgence.[^121] Critic G.H. Lewes, while generally admiring Charlotte's work, advised her to control her tendency toward "melodrama and improbability."[^122] Modern critics like Patricia Beer have argued that Charlotte's "rhetorical excess" sometimes obscures rather than illuminates her characters' psychology.[^123]

Her editorial treatment of Emily's and Anne's works has damaged her reputation as a trustworthy literary executor. By portraying Emily as unworldly and Anne as overly gentle, Charlotte created misleading images that distorted understanding of her sisters for decades.[^124] Her editorial changes to *Wuthering Heights*, attempting to make it more conventional, have been widely condemned.[^125]

Some scholars critique Charlotte's class attitudes as paternalistic and insufficiently radical. While she sympathized with the poor and depicted working-class suffering in *Shirley*, her solutions were charitable rather than structural, and her novels ultimately affirm class hierarchies even while critiquing individual class prejudice.[^126] Critic Terry Eagleton argues that Charlotte's novels reveal "the contradictions of an essentially conservative social vision trying to accommodate liberal individualism."[^127]

The cult of personality surrounding the Brontës has been criticized for obscuring serious literary analysis with biographical romanticism. Critics like Lucasta Miller argue that the "Brontë myth"—focusing on the tragic family story, the isolated parsonage, and the doomed sisters—has often displaced attention from the actual literary achievements of the Brontë novels.[^128] This sentimentalization, which began with Elizabeth Gaskell's biography, has sometimes reduced Charlotte to a tragic figure rather than recognizing her as a professional writer with deliberate artistic strategies.[^129]
