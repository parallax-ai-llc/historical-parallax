## Summary
Nazario Moreno González, known as 'El Más Loco' (The Craziest One), was the founder and leader of La Familia Michoacana and later the Knights Templar cartel. He mixed drug trafficking with pseudo-religious ideology, writing his own 'bible' for cartel members. He was killed in a shootout with Mexican forces in 2014.

## Early Life
Born March 8, 1970, in Apatzingán, Michoacán, Mexico. He migrated to the United States as a young man and was convicted of drug offenses. After deportation, he returned to Michoacán and founded La Familia Michoacana. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Moreno founded La Familia Michoacana, a drug cartel that combined methamphetamine production and trafficking with pseudo-religious ideology. He wrote a book of spiritual and moral teachings that members were required to follow. He later founded the Knights Templar cartel after La Familia split. Despite claims of defending communities, both organizations engaged in murder, extortion, and drug trafficking. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Mexican authorities initially reported Moreno killed in a 2010 operation, but his body was never found. It was later confirmed he had survived. He was killed on March 9, 2014, in a shootout with Mexican security forces in Tumbiscatío, Michoacán. His body was positively identified. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

## Negative Perspectives
- Founded two violent cartel organizations [^5]

- His cartels devastated Michoacán through violence and extortion
- Responsible for massive methamphetamine production
- His 'community defense' narrative masked criminal exploitation
