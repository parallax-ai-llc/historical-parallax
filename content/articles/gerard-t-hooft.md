## Summary

Gerard 't Hooft is a Dutch theoretical physicist who shared the 1999 Nobel Prize in Physics with Martinus Veltman for elucidating the quantum structure of electroweak interactions. He proved that gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking are renormalizable, making the Standard Model mathematically consistent. His work made precise calculations in particle physics possible. He also proposed the holographic principle.
