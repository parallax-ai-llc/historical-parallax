## Summary

Sergei Bulgakov was a Russian Orthodox priest, theologian, and economist who was one of the most important Russian religious thinkers of the 20th century. His 'Sophiology' — the doctrine of Divine Sophia (Wisdom) — was controversial but deeply influential. He was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1922 and became dean of the Saint Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris. His theological trilogy is one of the most ambitious works of modern Orthodox theology.
