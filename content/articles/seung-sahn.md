## Summary

Seung Sahn was a Korean Zen (Seon) master who founded the Kwan Um School of Zen, one of the largest international Zen organizations. He was one of the first Korean Zen masters to teach in the West, arriving in the United States in 1972 with no money and barely speaking English. His teaching style combined traditional Korean Seon with accessibility for Western students. His famous question 'What am I?' became the hallmark of his teaching.
