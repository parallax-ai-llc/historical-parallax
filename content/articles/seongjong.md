## Summary

Seongjong (born August 19, 1457; died January 20, 1494) was the 9th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1469 to 1494.[^1] His reign is celebrated as a golden age of peace, stability, and cultural flourishing, comparable to that of King Sejong. Seongjong is best known for completing the **Gyeongguk Daejeon** (Great Code of State Administration), which established the legal foundation of the dynasty for the next 500 years. He was also a patron of the arts and revitalized Confucian scholarship by promoting the **Sarim faction** to balance the powerful Hungu faction.[^2]

## Completion of the Law (Gyeongguk Daejeon)

The defining achievement of Seongjong's reign was the promulgation of the **Gyeongguk Daejeon** in 1485.
*   **Significance:** This law code, started by his grandfather Sejo, codified every aspect of state administration, social hierarchy, and criminal law. It completed the institutionalization of the Joseon state.[^3]

## The Patron of Scholars

Seongjong revived the **Hongmungwan** (Office of Special Advisors), a royal library and research institute similar to Sejong's Hall of Worthies.
*   **Sarim Faction:** To check the power of the conservative Meritorious Subjects (Hungu faction) who had dominated the court since Sejo's coup, Seongjong actively recruited young, idealistic neo-Confucian scholars from the provinces, known as the **Sarim**. This set the stage for future factional politics.[^4]
*   **Culture:** He commissioned numerous encyclopedias and texts on geography (*Dongguk Yeoji Seungram*), music (*Akhak Gwebeom*), and history (*Dongguk Tonggam*).

## Personal Life and Tragedy

Seongjong was known to be fond of alcohol and women, which sometimes conflicted with his strict Confucian officials.
*   **Deposed Queen Yun:** His second wife, Lady Yun (mother of **Yeonsangun**), was extremely jealous of his concubines. After she allegedly scratched the King's face in anger, she was deposed and later executed by poison. This tragedy sowed the seeds for the tyranny of his son.[^5]
