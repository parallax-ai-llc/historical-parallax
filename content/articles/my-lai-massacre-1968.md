## Summary

The **My Lai Massacre** was the mass murder of unarmed South Vietnamese civilians by U.S. troops in Son My village on March 16, 1968, during the Vietnam War. Soldiers of Charlie Company, 11th Brigade, led by **Lt. William Calley**, killed between **347 and 504 people**—mostly women, children, and the elderly. The atrocity included mutilation and gang rape. It was stopped only by the intervention of U.S. helicopter pilot **Hugh Thompson Jr.** The event was successfully covered up for a year until journalist Seymour Hersh broke the story, fueling massive anti-war protests.

## The Massacre

### "Search and Destroy"
Charlie Company entered the village on a "search and destroy" mission, told that the village was a Viet Cong stronghold and that all civilians would be at market. They found no enemy fire and no Viet Cong.
*   **The Killing:** Regardless, the soldiers began systematically killing everyone in sight. They bayoneted people, threw grenades into huts (hooches), and shot livestock.
*   **The Ditch:** Lt. Calley ordered dozens of villagers to be herded into an irrigation ditch. He then ordered his men to "waste them." Calley personally fired into the pile of screaming women and infants.

### Sexual Violence and Mutilation
Beyond murder, the brutality was sadistic. Women were gang-raped before being killed. Bodies were scalped, and "C Company" was carved into the chests of victims.

## The Intervention: Hugh Thompson Jr.

The carnage was interrupted by Chief Warrant Officer **Hugh Thompson Jr.**, a reconnaissance helicopter pilot.
*   **Standoff:** Seeing U.S. troops advancing on a bunker full of civilians, Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and the villagers. He ordered his gunner, Lawrence Colburn, to **shoot the Americans** if they tried to harm the civilians.
*   **Rescue:** Thompson successfully evacuated the civilians and personally waded into the ditch of bodies to rescue a 3-year-old child who was still alive.
*   **Aftermath:** For decades, Thompson was shunned as a traitor by the military establishment. He was only officially honored with the Soldier's Medal in 1998, thirty years later.

## The Cover-Up and Exposure

### "128 Viet Cong Killed"
The initial military report claimed a great victory: "128 Viet Cong killed and 3 weapons captured." Col. Oran Henderson and others dismissed reports of civilian casualties as enemy propaganda.
*   **Colin Powell:** Then a young army major, Colin Powell investigated a soldier's general letter about brutality. He did not interview the people involved in My Lai but wrote a report stating that relations between U.S. soldiers and the Vietnamese people were "excellent," a report later criticized as "whitewashing."

### Seymour Hersh and The Story
The truth came out thanks to **Ron Ridenhour**, a soldier who heard about the massacre from friends and wrote letters to Congress.
*   **1969:** Journalist **Seymour Hersh** tracked down William Calley and broke the story. The publication of photos by army photographer **Ronald Haeberle**—showing piles of dead bodies—shocked the world.

### Justice Denied
In 1971, Lt. William Calley was the *only* person convicted.
*   **Sentence:** He was sentenced to life in hard labor.
*   **Nixon's Intervention:** President Richard Nixon immediately intervened, ordering Calley moved to house arrest. He served only **3.5 years** in his own apartment before being paroled. No other officer was punished, fueling the belief that the U.S. military condoned war crimes.
