## Summary

Sunan Bonang (1465-1525), born Raden Maulana Makdum Ibrahim, was one of the legendary Wali Songo (Nine Saints) who established Islam as the dominant religion among the Javanese people during the 15th and 16th centuries.[^1] As the son of Sunan Ampel and brother of Sunan Drajat, he was renowned for his innovative use of traditional Javanese arts—particularly gamelan music and wayang puppet theater—to spread Islamic teachings across Java.[^2] A prolific writer of didactic Sufi poetry and a defender of Islamic orthodoxy, he served as teacher to Raden Patah, the first Sultan of Demak, and was responsible for converting Sunan Kalijaga, another prominent member of the Wali Songo.[^3] His tomb in Tuban, East Java, remains one of Indonesia's busiest pilgrimage sites, attracting over one million visitors annually.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Sunan Bonang was born in 1465 CE in Tuban, East Java, though some sources indicate he was born in Rembang, Central Java, near Tuban on the north coast.[^5] He was born to illustrious parentage: his father was Sunan Ampel (also known as Raden Rahmat), one of the most influential early members of the Wali Songo, and his mother was Nyi Ageng Manila.[^6] His birth name was Raden Maulana Makdum Ibrahim, though he would later become known by the name Sunan Bonang, likely derived from the village of Bonang in Rembang Regency where he may have spent part of his early life.[^7]

The etymology of his name "Bonang" has been subject to historical debate. Some scholars suggest it derives from the gamelan instrument he created—a brass percussion instrument with a circular shape and a protrusion in the center that produced melodious sounds when struck.[^8] Other sources propose that "Bonang" may actually be a Javanization of the Chinese name "Bong Ang," as his surname "Bong" matched his father's Chinese name, Bong Swi Hoo (alias Sunan Ampel).[^9] This theory is supported by evidence of Chinese ancestry in his family line: he was a descendant of Majapahit nobility in Tuban and a Chinese captain named Gan Engineer Cu.[^10] Some experts believe that several Wali Songo family lines, including Sunan Ampel, Sunan Bonang, and Sunan Kalijaga, had Chinese roots.[^11]

Growing up in the household of Sunan Ampel, one of Java's most learned Islamic scholars, Sunan Bonang received an extraordinary education. He mastered various Islamic sciences including fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), ushuluddin (Islamic theology), and tasawuf (Sufism), as well as secular subjects such as art, literature, architecture, and martial arts.[^12] This comprehensive education would prove instrumental in his future missionary work, as he became known as one of the most intellectually gifted members of the Wali Songo.[^13] His early exposure to both Islamic scholarship and Javanese cultural traditions shaped his distinctive approach to Islamic propagation, which would later become characterized by cultural synthesis and artistic innovation.

Unlike many Islamic scholars of his time, Sunan Bonang chose a path of celibacy, dedicating himself entirely to the spread of Islam in Java. He did not marry and left no biological descendants, an unusual choice in Islamic tradition where marriage is generally encouraged.[^14] However, Islamic jurisprudence recognizes exceptions for those with life missions so absorbing and time-consuming that they are not bothered by temptations and have no fear of falling into sin.[^15] Sunan Bonang's decision reflected his total commitment to his spiritual and missionary calling, channeling all his energy into teaching, writing, and converting the Javanese population to Islam.

## Rise to Power

Sunan Bonang's rise to prominence as a religious and cultural leader occurred during a pivotal period in Javanese history—the transition from Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms to Islamic sultanates in the 15th and 16th centuries.[^16] The Wali Songo moved along Java's north coast during the first half of the 15th century through the middle of the 16th century, ushering in a heyday of Islamic civilization and learning.[^17] Sunan Bonang emerged as a key figure in this transformation, building upon his father's legacy while developing innovative methods of Islamic propagation.

His breakthrough came through his relationship with Raden Patah, who would become the first Sultan of the Demak Sultanate, Java's first major Islamic kingdom.[^18] Sunan Bonang served as Raden Patah's religious teacher and spiritual advisor, wielding significant influence over the sultanate's religious orientation and policies.[^19] When Raden Patah invited him to become the imam of the Great Mosque of Demak, Sunan Bonang accepted, positioning himself at the spiritual heart of the emerging Islamic state.[^20] This role gave him a platform to shape Islamic practice and doctrine across the sultanate's expanding territories.

Beyond his formal position, Sunan Bonang gained recognition for his role in converting prominent individuals who would themselves become influential Islamic leaders. His most famous convert was Raden Said, a highway robber who had fallen into criminality after gambling losses.[^21] According to Javanese legend, when Raden Said attempted to rob Sunan Bonang on the north coast road, the saint transformed himself into four persons, traumatizing the would-be robber and prompting his spiritual awakening.[^22] Sunan Bonang agreed to accept Raden Said as his student on the condition that he meditate by the riverbank, guarding a walking stick, until Sunan Bonang returned. After waiting three years by the river, the student was given the name "Kalijaga" (meaning "guarding the river") and would become one of the most beloved members of the Wali Songo.[^23] This teacher-student relationship would prove historically significant, as Sunan Kalijaga continued and expanded Sunan Bonang's cultural approach to Islamic propagation.

Sunan Bonang's missionary territory encompassed the strategic northern coastal areas of Tuban, Lasem, and their surroundings, making him particularly influential in the spread of Islam across Java.[^24] His position as a "state saint" allied with the Demak Sultanate gave him both political backing and religious authority. He contributed significantly to the construction of the Great Mosque of Demak and participated in the political consolidation that established Raden Patah as the first king of the Demak Kingdom.[^25] This combination of spiritual leadership, political influence, and cultural innovation positioned Sunan Bonang as one of the most powerful figures in the Islamization of Java.

## Major Achievements

### Literary and Scholarly Contributions

Sunan Bonang's literary legacy stands as one of his most enduring achievements. He was known as a prolific writer and poet who composed many didactic poems offering easy comprehension of Islamic doctrines and beliefs.[^26] These works became foundational for the spread of Islamic faith in Java and are recognized as cornerstones of Javanese literature.[^27] His writings bridged the gap between complex Islamic theology and the cultural sensibilities of the Javanese people, making religious teachings accessible through familiar literary forms.

His major works include the Suluk and Primbon manuscripts, which contain profound mystical teachings. The **Suluk Wijil** presents a poetic depiction of the transition from Hinduism to Islam across various aspects of life including culture, politics, literature, and religious beliefs.[^28] Within this work, particularly in the section called Wijil Kinasih, Sunan Bonang embedded secrets and implicit messages for understanding the self, discussions about the essence of intention, and the ultimate goals of worship.[^29] The **Suluk Gentur** (also called Suluk Bentur) explains the stages toward the peak of Sufi spirituality, providing deep explanations of the shahada (Islamic testimony of faith) covering the shahada before birth, during conversion to Islam, and as uttered by prophets, saints, and true believers.[^30] The **Suluk Latri**, whose original manuscript is housed at Leiden University, describes in prose the restless feelings of someone awaiting the presence of their Beloved (God).[^31]

According to the manuscript **Het boek van Bonang** (also known as Lontar Ferrara), Dutch scholar Bep Schrieke recorded Sunan Bonang's views criticizing forms of bid'ah (religious innovation or heresy) and favoring orthodoxy in Islamic teaching.[^32] Sunan Bonang is believed to have based his mystical teachings on Shari'a law, emphatically stating that there was separation between God and humanity, distinguishing his approach from pantheistic interpretations of Sufism.[^33] Some scholars believe his Primbon manuscript from Tuban was a free summary of the influential Islamic text Kitab Ihya' 'Ulum ad-Din by Al-Ghazali.[^34]

### Musical and Artistic Innovation

Perhaps Sunan Bonang's most revolutionary achievement was his transformation of gamelan music into a vehicle for Islamic propagation. His very name is reportedly derived from the gamelan instrument he created or popularized—the bonang, a collection of brass gongs arranged in a circular shape with protrusions in the center that produced melodious sounds when struck with wooden mallets.[^35] He changed traditional Javanese songs, which had been heavily influenced by Hindu philosophy, and incorporated Islamic thought into them.[^36] By inserting Islamic values into the lyrics of songs performed with gamelan accompaniment, he made it easy for people to accept Islamic teachings without coercion.[^37]

His most famous composition is **"Tombo Ati"** (Medicine for the Heart), which remains popular among Indonesian communities five centuries after its creation.[^38] This syair (poem) summarizes five spiritual prescriptions for keeping the human heart close to God: reading the Qur'an with understanding, performing night prayers (qiyamul lail), associating with righteous people, fasting to restrain desires, and engaging in long dhikr (remembrance of God) at night.[^39] According to Sunan Bonang's teaching, these five methods help Muslims obtain peace and spiritual tranquility, protecting them from heart diseases such as anxiety, arrogance, envy, malice, ostentation, greed, doubt, and negligence.[^40] The song's message that true tranquility can only be achieved by drawing close to Allah continues to resonate with contemporary audiences.[^41]

Sunan Bonang also employed wayang kulit (shadow puppet theater) as a dakwah tool, dynamically adapting this traditional Hindu-influenced art form to convey Islamic teachings.[^42] He incorporated wayang performances into Islamic propagation, including conveying tawhid (monotheistic) messages through events called sekaten, derived from the term syahadatain (the two testimonies of faith).[^43] This cultural integration strategy preserved traditional art forms while making Islamic principles accessible to the local population through familiar narrative structures.[^44] His artistic spirit and cultural methodology were passed down to his most famous student, Sunan Kalijaga, who continued and expanded the tradition of using gamelan and wayang for Islamic propagation.[^45]

### Teaching and Spiritual Mentorship

Sunan Bonang's influence as a teacher shaped the trajectory of Javanese Islam through the leaders he trained. Beyond converting and mentoring Sunan Kalijaga, he served as the religious teacher of Raden Patah, the first Sultan of Demak, thereby directly influencing the religious policies and Islamic character of Java's first major Muslim sultanate.[^46] This dual legacy—shaping both political leadership and spiritual authority—amplified his impact across Javanese society.

His approach to teaching emphasized harmony and mutual respect, allowing Islam to be accepted organically by embedding Islamic messages in poetic compositions and artistic expressions that bridged the gap between religious teachings and Javanese cultural practices.[^47] He adapted gamelan, which had previously been influenced by Hindu aesthetics, transforming it to touch souls with the chanting of dhikr that led to longing for spiritual life.[^48] This pedagogical philosophy of cultural accommodation within Islamic orthodoxy became a model for subsequent generations of Islamic teachers in the archipelago.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Siti Jenar Dispute: Orthodoxy Versus Syncretism

The most significant controversy surrounding Sunan Bonang involved his longstanding theological dispute with Syekh Siti Jenar, another Javanese Islamic teacher whose approach to Islamic mysticism diverged sharply from Sunan Bonang's orthodox position.[^49] This debate, which remains relevant to conceptualizations of Javanese Islam today, centered on the proper balance between Islamic orthodoxy and accommodation to local cultural and spiritual traditions.[^50]

Siti Jenar emphasized a mystical approach to Sufism called pantheist Sufism (wujudiyah, or manunggaling kawulo gusti—the union of man and God), which opposed the shari'a-based Sufism favored by orthodox members of the Wali Songo.[^51] Sunan Bonang, along with Sunan Kudus, believed that inculturation was secondary to spreading sound Islamic teachings, whereas figures like Sunan Kalijaga and Siti Jenar were more concerned with the inculturation of Islam through local traditions.[^52] The Wali Songo were effectively divided into two camps: Sunan Giri represented the strictly orthodox position, while Sunan Kalijaga favored greater innovation and cultural synthesis, with Sunan Bonang generally aligned with the orthodox faction while still employing cultural methods like gamelan.[^53]

The dispute culminated in the legendary trial and execution of Siti Jenar for heresy, ordered by either Ja'far Sadiq or Sunan Kudus, a hardline Islamist who headed religious affairs in the Demak Sultanate.[^54] While there is historical debate over whether Siti Jenar's death was real or symbolic, the episode illustrated the political dimensions of theological disputes.[^55] Siti Jenar was perceived as an opponent to the political orientation of the sultanate, and his execution served to establish doctrinal boundaries for acceptable Islamic practice in the emerging Islamic state.[^56] Critics of Sunan Bonang and the orthodox faction argue that this episode represented religious intolerance and the suppression of mystical approaches to Islam that might have been more compatible with Javanese spiritual sensibilities.

### Questions About Historical Accuracy

The life of Sunan Bonang, like other members of the Wali Songo, is shrouded in obscurity and legend, making it difficult to distinguish historical fact from hagiographical embellishment.[^57] Although referred to as a group, there is evidence that fewer than nine Wali Songo were alive at any given time, and differences in chronology suggest there might never have been a period when all nine were alive contemporaneously.[^58] This has led some modern scholars to question whether "Wali Songo" should be understood as a literal group of nine specific individuals or rather as a symbolic representation of multiple generations of Islamic missionaries.

There is also a lack of consensus in Indonesian and Dutch primary sources regarding the location of Sunan Bonang's mausoleum, with disputes over whether he was buried in Tuban, East Java, or in Bonang Village, Lasem.[^59] Some legends claim that when he died, his body appeared in two locations simultaneously, leading to the establishment of two tomb sites.[^60] Such supernatural claims, while important to devotional traditions, complicate efforts to establish verifiable historical facts about his life and death.

### The Challenge of Reconciling Monism and Dualism

A central intellectual challenge in Sunan Bonang's missionary work was reconciling Javanese monism—the philosophical tradition inherited from Hindu-Buddhist thought that emphasized the unity of all existence—with the dualistic doctrines of Islamic orthodoxy, which insist on the fundamental distinction between Creator and creation.[^61] While Sunan Bonang attempted to navigate this tension by emphasizing that there was separation between God and humanity, critics from both sides found fault with the compromise. Strict orthodox Muslims questioned whether his use of gamelan, wayang, and other cultural forms compromised Islamic purity, while traditionalists committed to Javanese mystical thought may have found his insistence on shari'a-based practice restrictive.

---

## Personal Life

Sunan Bonang's personal life was characterized by asceticism and total dedication to his religious mission. Unlike most Islamic scholars and religious leaders of his era, he chose not to marry, leaving no biological descendants.[^62] This decision to embrace celibacy was unusual in Islamic tradition, where the Prophet Muhammad's example of marriage is considered an important sunnah (prophetic practice) to follow.[^63] However, Islamic jurisprudence recognizes that individuals with absorbing life missions who are not troubled by temptations may permissibly remain unmarried.[^64] Sunan Bonang apparently fell into this exceptional category, channeling the energy that others devoted to family life entirely into spreading Islam across Java.

Despite having no children of his own, Sunan Bonang cultivated numerous spiritual "descendants" through his students and converts. His most famous spiritual heir was Sunan Kalijaga, the reformed highway robber who became one of Java's most beloved saints and who continued Sunan Bonang's tradition of using cultural arts for Islamic propagation.[^65] Sunan Bonang's relationship with his students appears to have been demanding but transformative—the three-year trial he imposed on Raden Said before accepting him as a student demonstrated his exacting standards and his belief in the necessity of spiritual preparation before receiving advanced teachings.[^66]

Contemporary sources describe Sunan Bonang as a person of remarkable intelligence and versatility, mastering not only religious sciences but also arts, literature, architecture, and martial arts with extraordinary ability.[^67] This Renaissance-man quality enabled him to engage with Javanese society across multiple domains, connecting with political leaders, artists, craftsmen, and common people alike. His knowledge of tasawuf (Islamic mysticism) marked him as a spiritual teacher believed to possess sacred power, while his artistic talents made his religious message accessible and attractive.[^68]

His personality appears to have combined orthodox conviction with cultural sensitivity. While he was famous for defending Islamic orthodoxy against what he perceived as heresies and innovations, he simultaneously demonstrated remarkable creativity in adapting Islamic teachings to Javanese cultural forms.[^69] This paradoxical combination—doctrinal strictness alongside methodological flexibility—characterized his approach and distinguished him from both rigid fundamentalists on one hand and syncretic innovators like Siti Jenar on the other.

Sunan Bonang's life was centered in the northern coastal regions of Java, particularly Tuban, Lasem, and Demak, where he established his teaching presence and built religious institutions.[^70] He died in 1525 CE at Pulau Bawean, though his body was interred in Tuban.[^71] According to legend, his remains appeared simultaneously in two locations, leading to the establishment of tomb sites in both Tuban and Bonang Village in Lasem, though the Tuban site became the primary pilgrimage destination.[^72]

## Legacy

### Enduring Cultural Impact

Sunan Bonang's most visible legacy is the cultural synthesis between Islam and Javanese tradition that continues to characterize Indonesian Islamic practice. His innovative use of gamelan music as a vehicle for Islamic teachings transformed what had been a Hindu-influenced art form into an Islamic cultural expression, creating a distinctively Javanese Islamic aesthetic that persists to the present day.[^73] The gamelan bonang instrument remains a central component of traditional Javanese musical ensembles, keeping his name alive in every performance.[^74] His composition "Tombo Ati" continues to be sung in Islamic gatherings across Indonesia five centuries after its creation, demonstrating the timeless appeal of his spiritual message.[^75]

His approach to Islamic propagation—emphasizing cultural accommodation while maintaining doctrinal orthodoxy—became a model for subsequent generations of Islamic teachers in Indonesia. The methodology of embedding Islamic teachings within indigenous artistic forms, rather than demanding the abandonment of traditional culture, facilitated the widespread acceptance of Islam across the archipelago.[^76] This cultural strategy helped Java transition from a Hindu-Buddhist civilization to a Muslim-majority society without the violent upheaval that characterized religious transitions in many other regions.

### Religious Pilgrimage and Devotional Practice

The tomb complex of Sunan Bonang in Tuban has become one of Indonesia's busiest pilgrimage sites, attracting more than one million visitors annually.[^77] Located behind the Great Mosque (Masjid Agung) in the center of town, the tomb complex reflects a fascinating blend of Javanese and Chinese architectural styles, physically embodying the cultural synthesis Sunan Bonang advocated during his lifetime.[^78] Every day, domestic and foreign pilgrims visit the site with prayers and requests, and the annual haul (death anniversary) celebration held on Thursday Pon in the month of Muharram draws particularly large crowds.[^79]

This enduring pilgrimage tradition demonstrates that Sunan Bonang remains a living presence in Indonesian Islamic spirituality rather than merely a historical figure. Devotees seek his intercession (tawassul) for various needs, viewing him as a spiritual intermediary who can help bring their prayers to God's attention. While such practices are contested by reformist Muslims who view them as bid'ah (innovation) incompatible with orthodox Islam, they reflect the popular piety that Sunan Bonang himself cultivated through his Sufi teachings and mystical writings.[^80]

### Influence on Indonesian Islamic Identity

Sunan Bonang's legacy extends beyond specific practices to shape the broader character of Indonesian Islam. His insistence that Islam could be spread through cultural accommodation rather than cultural destruction provided a template for a tolerant, culturally embedded form of Islamic practice that distinguishes Indonesian Islam from stricter interpretations found in the Middle East.[^81] At the same time, his defense of orthodox doctrine against syncretism established boundaries that prevented Islam from being absorbed entirely into pre-existing Javanese mystical traditions.

The tension between orthodoxy and cultural adaptation that defined Sunan Bonang's approach continues to characterize debates within Indonesian Islam. Traditional organizations like Nahdlatul Ulama embrace cultural practices rooted in the Wali Songo tradition, while reformist movements like Muhammadiyah advocate for a "purification" of Islam from cultural accretions they view as bid'ah.[^82] In this ongoing debate, Sunan Bonang's example is invoked by both sides—traditionalists point to his use of gamelan and wayang, while reformists emphasize his criticism of heresy and defense of orthodoxy.

His influence on Islamic education persists through the pesantren (Islamic boarding school) system that traces its origins to the teaching methods of the Wali Songo. The emphasis on personal discipleship under a spiritually authoritative teacher, which Sunan Bonang exemplified in his relationship with students like Sunan Kalijaga, remains central to traditional Islamic education in Indonesia.[^83] The combination of formal Islamic sciences with appreciation for arts and culture that characterized Sunan Bonang's own education continues to be reflected in many pesantren curricula.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Sunan Bonang favorably emphasize his genius in developing culturally appropriate methods for Islamic propagation that respected Javanese identity while successfully converting the population to Islam.[^84] His use of gamelan music and wayang puppet theater is celebrated as a brilliant strategy that made Islamic teachings accessible and attractive to people deeply attached to their cultural traditions.[^85] Rather than demanding that Javanese abandon their artistic heritage, Sunan Bonang transformed these art forms from within, filling them with Islamic content while preserving their aesthetic appeal.

Indonesian Islamic scholars particularly praise Sunan Bonang's contributions to Javanese Islamic literature through his Suluk writings, which provided sophisticated mystical teachings in Javanese literary forms.[^86] His ability to convey complex theological concepts through poetry made profound spiritual truths accessible to ordinary people who lacked formal religious training. The educational value of works like "Tombo Ati," which distills essential Islamic practices into memorable poetic form, continues to be recognized by religious educators.[^87]

Defenders of Sunan Bonang's orthodox position argue that his criticism of Siti Jenar's pantheistic teachings was necessary to prevent Islam from being absorbed into Javanese mysticism and losing its distinctive monotheistic character.[^88] By insisting on the fundamental distinction between Creator and creation, Sunan Bonang preserved the integrity of Islamic doctrine while still accommodating cultural expressions. This balanced approach is viewed as a model of how to maintain religious authenticity while engaging respectfully with indigenous cultures.

His role as teacher to both Raden Patah and Sunan Kalijaga is celebrated as having shaped the trajectory of Javanese Islam through multiple generations. By influencing political leadership through Raden Patah and spiritual/cultural leadership through Sunan Kalijaga, Sunan Bonang ensured that his vision for Javanese Islam would be implemented across both political and religious domains.[^89] The Demak Sultanate, which he helped establish, became the model for subsequent Islamic states in Java and provided political support for continued Islamization.[^90]

Contemporary scholars studying Islamic approaches to inculturation and contextualization often point to Sunan Bonang as a historical example of successful religious adaptation. His work demonstrates that religious traditions need not be culturally imperialistic but can engage creatively with local cultures while maintaining core doctrinal commitments.[^91] In an era of globalization and cultural encounter, his legacy offers valuable lessons about cultural sensitivity in religious propagation.

### Negative Views

Critics of Sunan Bonang, particularly reformist Muslims influenced by Salafi thought, argue that his accommodation to Javanese culture introduced bid'ah (unwarranted innovations) into Islamic practice that diluted the religion's purity.[^92] They point to practices like tomb veneration and seeking intercession through deceased saints—practices now widespread in Java—as departures from authentic Islam that can be traced to the Wali Songo period. While Sunan Bonang himself may have opposed certain syncretistic practices, critics argue that his cultural approach opened the door to problematic innovations that he did not intend.

Some scholars question whether Sunan Bonang's use of gamelan and wayang—art forms with Hindu-Buddhist origins and associations—was truly compatible with Islamic monotheism or whether it represented an unacceptable compromise. They note that these art forms carried cosmological and mythological content rooted in non-Islamic worldviews, and argue that merely changing the lyrics or narrative content was insufficient to transform them into genuinely Islamic expressions.[^93] From this perspective, Sunan Bonang's cultural strategy, while pragmatically successful, was theologically problematic.

The dispute with Siti Jenar and the latter's execution have drawn criticism from scholars concerned about religious tolerance and freedom of thought. Some view the orthodox faction's suppression of Siti Jenar's mystical teachings as religious authoritarianism that stifled intellectual diversity within Javanese Islam.[^94] While Sunan Bonang's precise role in Siti Jenar's execution remains historically unclear, his alignment with the orthodox position associates him with this episode of religious intolerance. Critics argue that this demonstrates the dangers of alliance between religious authorities and political power, a pattern that would recur throughout Islamic history.

Secular historians raise questions about the historical accuracy of traditional narratives surrounding Sunan Bonang, noting that many stories about him—such as his transformation into four people to frighten Raden Said, or his body appearing in two locations after death—are clearly legendary rather than historical.[^95] The hagiographical nature of sources makes it difficult to assess what Sunan Bonang actually accomplished versus what was later attributed to him by devotees. Some scholars suggest that "Sunan Bonang" may represent a composite figure embodying the work of multiple missionaries rather than a single historical individual.

Postcolonial scholars note that the Wali Songo narrative, including Sunan Bonang's role, was shaped by colonial-era scholarship and Indonesian nationalist historiography in ways that may distort historical reality.[^96] The portrayal of the Wali Songo as nine coordinated missionaries who peacefully converted Java serves nationalist narratives about Indonesian Islam's tolerant character, but may oversimplify a more complex and contested process of religious transformation. From this critical perspective, Sunan Bonang has become a symbol deployed for various political and religious purposes rather than a figure whose actual historical role can be clearly determined.
