## Summary

In April 2022, Imran Khan became the first Pakistani prime minister removed through a parliamentary no-confidence vote. But that was only the beginning. For the next two years, Khan transformed from deposed premier to iconic opposition leader, leading mass rallies that shook Pakistan's military-dominated political order. His message was simple: he was ousted by a "foreign conspiracy" backed by the United States and enabled by Pakistan's powerful military establishment.[^1]

Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party mobilized millions. The "Azadi March" to Islamabad became a recurring spectacle. In November 2022, Khan survived an assassination attempt. In May 2023, his arrest triggered the worst violence Pakistan had seen in years—PTI supporters attacked military installations, and the state responded with mass arrests. Khan was imprisoned in August 2023, disqualified from politics, and has remained behind bars as of late 2024.[^2]

The crisis exposed Pakistan's fundamental contradiction: a nominal democracy where the military has historically made and unmade governments. Khan, once a military favorite, became its greatest threat. His imprisonment created a martyr figure but left PTI leaderless. The 2024 elections, widely seen as rigged against PTI, produced a fragile government while Khan's millions of supporters simmer. Pakistan's political future remains uncertain.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Pakistan's Political Pattern

**The military's role:**

- Ruled directly 1958-1971, 1977-1988, 1999-2008
- Even in "democratic" periods, sets foreign policy, security
- Makes and breaks civilian governments
- Current Chief: General Asim Munir (2022-present)

**Imran Khan's rise:**

- Cricket legend; national hero
- Founded PTI (1996)
- Won 2018 election (with military support, critics say)
- "Naya Pakistan" (New Pakistan) promised

**His government (2018-2022):**

- Anti-corruption rhetoric
- Economic struggles (inflation, debt)
- Tensions with military grew
- Lost military support by 2022[^4]

### The No-Confidence Vote

**March-April 2022:**

- Opposition filed no-confidence motion
- Khan claimed "foreign conspiracy" (US cipher)
- National Assembly speaker blocked vote (unconstitutional)
- Supreme Court ordered vote proceed

**April 10, 2022:**

- **Khan lost vote 174-0** (PTI boycotted)
- First PM removed by parliament
- Shehbaz Sharif became PM
- Khan claimed coup/conspiracy[^5]

## The Protests

### Immediate Aftermath (April 2022)

**Khan's narrative:**

- "Imported government"
- "Regime change conspiracy"
- US wanted him out for opposing Ukraine policy
- Military ("Establishment") collaborated

**Mass rallies:**

- Huge turnout for PTI
- Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad
- Demanded early elections

### May 2022: "Azadi March" I

**May 25, 2022:**

- Khan led march toward Islamabad
- Tens of thousands participated
- Police clashed with protesters
- Government blocked entry to capital
- Marchers dispersed after 5 days

**The pattern was set: massive PTI mobilization, government resistance.**[^6]

### October-November 2022: "Haqeeqi Azadi March"

**October 28, 2022:**

- Khan began long march from Lahore
- Slow progress toward Rawalpindi/Islamabad

**November 3, 2022:**

- **Khan shot during rally** (Wazirabad)
- Wounded in leg (assassination attempt)
- Rally halted
- Khan accused government, military figures

**The attack:**

- Gunman apprehended

### May 9, 2023: The Explosion

**May 9, 2023:**

- Khan arrested from Islamabad High Court

- Video spread: dramatic, humiliating arrest

**Immediate response:**

- **Unprecedented violence**
- PTI supporters attacked military installations
- Army headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi targeted
- Corps commander's residence in Lahore stormed
- ISI building attacked

**This was unprecedented:** Attacking the army is unthinkable in Pakistan's political culture.

**Casualties:** Several killed; hundreds injured

**State response:**

- Supreme Court declared arrest unlawful (May 11)
- Khan released
- But: Massive crackdown on PTI began
- Thousands arrested
- Military courts for civilians announced[^8]

## 2024 Elections and After

### February 2024 Elections

**Context:**

- PTI officially barred (symbols denied)
- Khan imprisoned, couldn't campaign
- Major crackdown on party

**Results:**

- PTI-backed independents won most seats
- But couldn't form government
- Coalition of PMLN + PPP formed government

---

## Historical Assessment

### What Does This Mean?

**For Pakistan:**

- Military's power confirmed
- Democracy's limits exposed
- Popular will can be suppressed
- But: Can't eliminate Khan's support base

**Khan's significance:**

- First leader to directly challenge military publicly
- Mobilized urban middle class
- Made "establishment" speakable
- But: Imprisoned, possibly finished politically

### Comparison

| Pakistani Crisis   | Nature             | Outcome                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 1977 (Bhutto)      | Military coup      | Bhutto executed                       |
| 1999 (Sharif)      | Military coup      | Sharif exiled                         |
| **2022-24 (Khan)** | **"Soft" removal** | **Khan imprisoned; party suppressed** |

**Khan's case: Not a formal coup, but similar result.**

### The Question

**Can PTI survive without Khan?**

- Movement depends on him personally
- No clear successor
- But: Millions remember

**Will Khan ever be free?**

- Political decisions, not legal
- Depends on establishment's calculations

## Legacy

### For Pakistan

- Shows democracy's fragility
- Military remains paramount
- Popular movements can be crushed
- But resentment doesn't disappear

### For Khan

- From cricket hero to PM to prisoner
- Polarizing figure
- Either a martyr or a demagogue, depending on view
- His chapter may not be finished[^11]
