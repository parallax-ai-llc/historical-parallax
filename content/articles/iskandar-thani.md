## Summary

Iskandar Thani Alauddin Mughayat Syah (1610 – 15 February 1641) was the thirteenth Sultan of Aceh, a powerful maritime sultanate in northern Sumatra, Indonesia.[^1] Born as a prince of Pahang, he was brought to Aceh as a captive following his kingdom's conquest in 1617, only to rise to become sultan after marrying the daughter of the legendary Iskandar Muda.[^2] His brief five-year reign (1636-1641) marked a critical transition period for Aceh, as he struggled to maintain centralized authority following the catastrophic naval defeat of 1629 while patronizing Islamic scholarship and attempting to balance relations with European colonial powers.[^3] Though unable to match his predecessor's military achievements, Iskandar Thani is remembered as a strong centralizer who suppressed the nobility and fostered Aceh's reputation as a center of Islamic learning through his patronage of the influential scholar Nuruddin ar-Raniri.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Iskandar Thani was born in 1610 as Raja Mughal (also known as Sultan Bungsu), the eldest son of Sultan Ahmad Shah II of Pahang, the 11th ruler of that Malay sultanate on the eastern coast of the Malay Peninsula.[^5] His early childhood was spent in the royal courts of Pahang, where he would have received education befitting a Malay prince, learning courtly etiquette, Islamic teachings, and the arts of governance.[^6] However, his life took a dramatic turn in 1617 when he was just seven years old.

In that fateful year, the powerful Sultan Iskandar Muda of Aceh launched a military expedition against Pahang during an interregnum period of chaos following the death of Sultan Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah in 1614.[^7] The Acehnese forces successfully conquered Pahang, and the former Sultan Ahmad Shah II and his entire family were taken as hostages to Aceh.[^8] Sultan Ahmad Shah II died shortly after arriving in Aceh, leaving the young prince in a precarious position as a royal captive in a foreign court.[^9]

Rather than being treated as a mere prisoner, however, the young Raja Mughal was raised as the foster son of Sultan Iskandar Muda himself.[^10] This unusual arrangement demonstrated the Malay tradition of incorporating conquered royal bloodlines into the ruling dynasty, and Iskandar Muda clearly saw potential in the young prince from Pahang. The boy received an education at the Acehnese court, one of the most sophisticated and powerful Islamic sultanates in Southeast Asia at the time, exposed to the highest levels of Islamic scholarship, statecraft, and military strategy.[^11]

The Bustanus-Salatin, a major historical text of the period, provides an account explaining why this foreign prince was eventually chosen by his foster father to become ruler of the Aceh Sultanate.[^12] According to these sources, Sultan Bungsu (as he was known in his youth) demonstrated exceptional qualities of leadership, piety, and intelligence that impressed Sultan Iskandar Muda.[^13] This impression would prove crucial to his future rise to power, particularly after the tragic execution of Iskandar Muda's biological heir.

---

## Rise to Power

The path to Iskandar Thani's accession was paved by one of the most controversial episodes in Acehnese history: the execution of Crown Prince Meurah Pupok, the biological son and heir of Sultan Iskandar Muda.[^14] According to historical accounts, a military officer reported that his wife had committed adultery with the crown prince.[^15] In a demonstration of his uncompromising commitment to Islamic law, Sultan Iskandar Muda ordered his own son and heir executed for this transgression, a decision that shocked the court but underscored the sultan's reputation for strict justice regardless of personal considerations.[^16]

With no surviving male heir, Sultan Iskandar Muda needed to ensure the continuation of his dynasty. In 1619, when the young prince from Pahang was only nine years old, he was married to Putri Sri Alam Permisuri, the daughter of Sultan Iskandar Muda.[^17] This arranged marriage served both dynastic and political purposes, binding the young captive prince to the Acehnese royal family and positioning him as a potential successor. The newly married couple was provided with their own palace adjacent to the sultan's residence, called Sri Warna, signifying their special status within the court hierarchy.[^18]

Over the following seventeen years, the prince—now known by his new title—lived at the Acehnese court, observing and learning the art of governance from one of Southeast Asia's most powerful rulers. This period coincided with both the height of Iskandar Muda's power and the beginning of Aceh's military decline following the catastrophic naval defeat at the Battle of Duyon River in 1629.[^19] When a massive Acehnese fleet of 236 vessels carrying approximately 19,000 men attempted to capture Portuguese Malacca, they were utterly destroyed by a smaller Portuguese relief force, with not a single ship or man returning to Aceh according to Portuguese accounts.[^20] This disaster fundamentally altered Aceh's strategic position and would significantly constrain the options available to the future sultan.

When Sultan Iskandar Muda died on 27 December 1636, his son-in-law succeeded him as Sultan Iskandar Thani Alauddin Mughayat Syah, the thirteenth Sultan of Aceh.[^21] At age 26, he inherited a sultanate still reeling from the 1629 naval catastrophe, facing challenges both from resurgent nobility seeking to reclaim power from the centralized state and from European colonial powers—particularly the Dutch VOC—increasingly active in Southeast Asian waters.[^22]

## Major Achievements

Despite his relatively brief reign and the constraints imposed by Aceh's post-1629 decline, Iskandar Thani achieved several notable accomplishments that left a lasting mark on Acehnese history and Islamic scholarship in Southeast Asia.

**Centralization of Royal Authority**: Like his predecessor and father-in-law, Iskandar Thani was determined to maintain strong centralized control over the sultanate. He successfully suppressed the orang kaya, the hereditary Acehnese nobility who constantly sought to expand their autonomous power at the expense of the sultan.[^23] This was no small achievement, as these nobles controlled local resources and military forces. By maintaining centralized authority throughout his five-year reign, Iskandar Thani prevented the immediate collapse of royal power that would occur after his death, when the orang kaya would reassert their influence and place his widow on the throne as a more pliable ruler.[^24]

**Patronage of Islamic Scholarship**: One of Iskandar Thani's most significant and enduring contributions was his role as patron of Islamic learning, continuing and even enhancing Aceh's reputation as a major center of Islamic scholarship in Southeast Asia. In 1637, he appointed Shaykh Nuruddin Muhammad bin 'Ali bin Hasanji bin Muhammad Hamid al-Raniri (known as Nuruddin ar-Raniri) as the Shaykh al-Islam, the highest religious office in the sultanate.[^25] Ar-Raniri, who had arrived in Aceh on 31 May 1637 from Ranir (Rander) in Gujarat, India, was a renowned orthodox Sufi scholar, jurist, and historian.[^26]

**Commission of Bustan al-Salatin**: At Sultan Iskandar Thani's commission, Nuruddin ar-Raniri composed the monumental Bustan al-Salatin fi Dhikr al-Awwalin wa al-Akhirin ("The Garden of Kings on the Recollection of the Past and Present"), begun on 4 March 1638 (17th Shawwal 1047 A.H.) and probably completed around 1640-1642.[^27] This seven-volume encyclopedic work, written in Malay based on Arabic sources, covers the history of the world from creation through the period of the prophets of Islam and the Muslim kings of the Middle East and the Malay region, as well as several sciences.[^28] It represents the longest text of traditional Malay literature and belongs to the "Mirror for Princes" genre, providing guidance on governance, Islamic history, and proper conduct for Muslim rulers.[^29] Ar-Raniri authored 35 works on various Islamic disciplines including tasawuf (Sufism), theology, fiqh (jurisprudence), and history, making him the most prolific author of the Acehnese court and helping to cement Aceh's international reputation as a center of scholarship.[^30]

**Economic Agreements with the Dutch**: In pursuing commercial advantages and potential military alliances, Iskandar Thani granted significant economic concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC). He granted the Dutch exemption from customs duties and exclusive nation treatment for the pepper trade, further agreeing that pepper—traditionally carried by Acehnese officials—would now be carried by Dutch vessels.[^31] These agreements provided crucial commercial privileges to the VOC while potentially securing Dutch support for Acehnese strategic objectives.

**Diplomatic Correspondence**: Iskandar Thani engaged in sophisticated diplomatic correspondence with European powers, particularly the Dutch. A surviving letter from 1639 to Frederik Hendrik, Prince of Orange, demonstrates the elaborate protocol and self-presentation of Acehnese royalty, referring to the sultan with titles describing him as "the one who holds the world," "glistering as the sun at noon," and whose "splendor gives light like the full moon."[^32] Similar correspondence was sent to Governor-General Antonio van Diemen regarding potential military cooperation.[^33]

**Symbols of Royal Prestige**: Iskandar Thani maintained the symbols and ceremonial displays that demonstrated Aceh's continued wealth and power despite military setbacks. He possessed one thousand elephants, even exceeding the approximately 900 elephants owned by Iskandar Muda.[^34] These elephants served multiple purposes: they were used in military formations, for ceremonial processions, for receiving important guests, and for fortifying the palace.[^35] The Adat Aceh manuscript describes the ceremonial procession for Hari Raya Haji (Id al-Adha), which included 30 individually-named palace elephants.[^36]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Iskandar Thani's reign was marked by several controversial policies and failures that have drawn historical criticism and continue to shape his complex legacy.

**Religious Persecution and Book Burning**: Perhaps the most controversial aspect of Iskandar Thani's reign was his support for Nuruddin ar-Raniri's violent persecution of followers of the wujudiyya Sufi teaching. During the reigns of Sultan Alauddin Riayat Shah and Iskandar Muda, the wujudiyya school—represented by Shaykh Hamzah al-Fansuri (d. 1590) and Shaykh Syamsuddin al-Sumatrani (d. 1630)—had been dominant in Aceh, teaching a mystical path toward possible unity with God.[^37] When Iskandar Thani appointed the orthodox ar-Raniri as Shaykh al-Islam in 1637, ar-Raniri condemned the wujudiyya teaching as deviant and heretical, viewing it as a violation of Islamic belief that God remains unchanged by his creation.[^38]

With the sultan's support, ar-Raniri ordered the execution of some wujudiyya followers and commanded that all books by al-Fansuri and al-Sumatrani be collected and publicly burned.[^39] Royal officials hunted down followers, forcing them to "convert" and abandon their beliefs under threat of violence and death.[^40] Victims of this persecution reportedly included even members of the sultan's own family.[^41] This religious persecution represented a dramatic and traumatic shift in Acehnese intellectual life, destroying an important strand of Islamic mystical thought that had flourished in the archipelago for decades.

**Failure to Support the Dutch Against Malacca**: One of the most puzzling and criticized aspects of Iskandar Thani's foreign policy was his failure to provide military support for the Dutch-VOC campaign to capture Portuguese Malacca in 1640-1641, despite having agreed to do so in negotiations. In 1638, Governor van Deutecom obtained an agreement from Iskandar Thani to attack Malacca jointly with the Dutch, and Paulus Croocq secured a similar commitment when he visited Aceh in 1639.[^42] Yet when the time came for action, Aceh failed to assist Governor-General Antonio van Diemen despite repeated appeals.[^43]

The sultan's anxiety and anger about the Dutch potentially including Johor—Aceh's traditional rival—in the alliance was evident in letters to Prince Frederick Hendrik and Van Diemen written between 1637 and 1639.[^44] Iskandar Thani threatened that the Dutch would never again set foot in Aceh if Johor were included in the alliance, revealing the depth of Acehnese hostility toward their Malay rivals.[^45] Ultimately, the Dutch proceeded with the siege of Malacca from 3 August 1640 to 14 January 1641 with assistance from Johor and Patani but without Aceh's help, successfully capturing the Portuguese fortress.[^46] This failure to capitalize on an opportunity to weaken a European colonial power and potentially gain influence over Malacca has been viewed by some historians as a strategic mistake, though recent scholarship suggests more complex reasons beyond mere delaying tactics.[^47]

**Inability to Restore Military Power**: Reigning in the wake of the catastrophic defeat of the Acehnese fleet in 1629, Iskandar Thani was unable to continue his predecessor's military expansion and aggressive foreign policy.[^48] His rule was too short to make major military accomplishments, and he focused primarily on internal consolidation rather than external conquest.[^49] Critics have argued that this represented a retreat from Aceh's former glory, though defenders note that the 1629 disaster had fundamentally altered the strategic landscape and that Iskandar Thani's consolidation may have been the only realistic policy available.

**Short Reign and Limited Impact**: At just five years, Iskandar Thani's reign was too brief to implement long-term transformative policies or fully realize his vision for Aceh. After his death, the elite orang kaya immediately reasserted their influence, placing his widow Taj ul-Alam on the throne as the first of four successive female sultanas who ruled from 1641 to 1699.[^50] This succession pattern suggests that the nobility viewed Iskandar Thani's death as an opportunity to reduce centralized royal power, partially undermining his efforts at consolidation.

---

## Personal Life

Iskandar Thani's personal life was inextricably bound up with the political dynamics of the Acehnese court and his unique position as a foreign-born sultan.

**Marriage and Family**: As previously noted, Iskandar Thani was married in 1619 at the age of nine to Putri Sri Alam Permisuri, daughter of Sultan Iskandar Muda, who would later become Sultana Taj ul-Alam Safiatuddin Syah.[^51] The couple lived in the Sri Warna palace adjacent to the sultan's residence.[^52] Despite this long marriage from 1619 until Iskandar Thani's death in 1641—a period of 22 years—the couple did not produce any children.[^53] This lack of an heir would prove significant for Aceh's future, as it led to the unprecedented succession of four female sultanas after 1641.

The relationship between Iskandar Thani and his wife appears to have been shaped by the political circumstances of their arranged marriage. Putri Sri Alam, as the daughter of the powerful Iskandar Muda, would have occupied a position of considerable status and influence at court. Her later success in ruling Aceh for 34 years (1641-1675) with notable peacefulness and stability due to her diplomatic skills suggests she was an intelligent and capable partner, though historical sources provide limited details about the couple's personal relationship.[^54]

**Character and Personality**: Historical sources describe Iskandar Thani as a strong ruler who actively worked to maintain centralized royal authority against the constant pressures from the orang kaya nobility.[^55] This suggests a forceful personality and considerable political skill, especially given his position as a foreign-born ruler who might have faced questions about his legitimacy. His ability to suppress the nobility and maintain control throughout his reign indicates both personal strength and effective use of the state apparatus.

Like his predecessor Iskandar Muda, Iskandar Thani's court was known as a center of Islamic learning, suggesting his personal interest in religious and intellectual matters.[^56] His patronage of Nuruddin ar-Raniri and commission of the massive Bustan al-Salatin encyclopedia indicates an intellectual curiosity and commitment to Islamic scholarship. However, his support for ar-Raniri's violent persecution of the wujudiyya school also reveals a willingness to use harsh measures to enforce religious orthodoxy as he understood it.

**Identity and Legitimacy**: Throughout his life, Iskandar Thani navigated a complex identity. Born a Malay prince of Pahang, captured as a child, raised as a foster son in Aceh, married into the royal family, and eventually elevated to sultan—each of these stages shaped his sense of self and his relationship to power. The Bustanus-Salatin's account of "Sultan Bungsu" suggests that his story was considered sufficiently unusual that it required special explanation for why this foreigner became ruler of Aceh.[^57]

## Legacy

Iskandar Thani's death on 15 February 1641 marked a critical turning point in Acehnese and Southeast Asian history, with consequences that extended far beyond his brief five-year reign.

**The Beginning of Aceh's Decline**: Historians generally mark Iskandar Thani's death as the beginning of Aceh's long decline from its position as one of Southeast Asia's most powerful maritime sultanates.[^58] The 1641 death sparked Dutch and British efforts to dominate the region more aggressively, as the European powers recognized that Aceh's period of military might had passed.[^59] The sultanate would never again pose a serious military threat to European colonial expansion in the Straits of Malacca.

**The Era of the Sultanahs**: Immediately following Iskandar Thani's death, the powerful orang kaya nobility selected his widow, Taj ul-Alam, as the first female ruler to preserve the ruling lineage in the absence of male heirs.[^60] This unprecedented decision initiated a unique period in Islamic history: from 1641 to 1699, four women sat on the throne of Aceh in succession—Taj ul-Alam Safiatuddin Syah (1641-1675), Nurul Alam Naqiatuddin Syah (1675-1678), Inayat Zakiatuddin Syah (1678-1688), and Kamalat Zainatuddin Syah (1688-1699).[^61] This succession pattern has been attributed to old Southeast Asian traditions that acknowledged inheritance through the female line, which proved more important than orthodox Muslim principles opposing female rule.[^62]

During this period, royal authority became increasingly restricted to the capital city itself, with the power of local lords strengthening at the expense of central control.[^63] The successful centralization that both Iskandar Muda and Iskandar Thani had fought to maintain gradually eroded, fundamentally altering the sultanate's political structure.

**Contribution to Islamic Scholarship**: Perhaps Iskandar Thani's most enduring legacy lies in his patronage of Islamic learning and his commissioning of the Bustan al-Salatin. This monumental work became a foundational text of Malay Islamic literature and historiography, introducing the concept of Islamic history to Malay-Indonesian writing.[^64] Nuruddin ar-Raniri's works, produced under Iskandar Thani's patronage, represented the oldest Muslim scholarship of Southeast Asia and helped establish standards for Islamic learning in the region.[^65] Aceh's reputation as a center of Islamic scholarship, fostered during Iskandar Thani's reign, would continue to influence religious and intellectual life in the Malay-Indonesian archipelago for centuries.

**A Transitional Figure**: Iskandar Thani is remembered as a transitional figure between the height of Acehnese power under Iskandar Muda and the period of decline and female rule that followed. His reign represented a critical moment when Aceh might have adapted to new strategic realities and maintained its influence through alternative means, but the brevity of his rule prevented the full realization of any long-term vision.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and defenders of Iskandar Thani's legacy emphasize several aspects of his reign that merit recognition and appreciation.

**Effective Crisis Management**: Given the catastrophic circumstances he inherited—a devastating naval defeat, economic disruption, and emboldened nobility—Iskandar Thani's ability to maintain stability and centralized control for five years represents a significant accomplishment.[^66] Some historians argue that his focus on internal consolidation and religious unity was precisely the correct strategy for the circumstances, even if it appeared less glorious than his predecessor's military adventures.[^67]

**Cultural and Intellectual Patronage**: Iskandar Thani's contribution to Islamic scholarship through his patronage of Nuruddin ar-Raniri receives consistent praise from historians of Islamic thought and Malay literature. M.C. Ricklefs, in his authoritative "History of Modern Indonesia Since c. 1300," acknowledges the significance of this patronage for the development of Malay Islamic literature.[^68] J.M. Barwise and N.J. White's "A Traveller's History of Southeast Asia" similarly recognizes the importance of the court of Iskandar Thani in the intellectual history of the region.[^69]

The Bustan al-Salatin, commissioned by Iskandar Thani, is recognized by scholars as the longest text of traditional Malay literature and a pioneering work that introduced Islamic historical writing to the Malay-Indonesian world.[^70] This encyclopedic work continues to be studied by scholars of Malay literature, Islamic studies, and Southeast Asian history, ensuring that Iskandar Thani's name remains associated with one of the region's most important cultural achievements.

**Maintenance of Aceh's International Prestige**: Despite military setbacks, Iskandar Thani maintained the symbolic and ceremonial displays that demonstrated Aceh's continued importance. His possession of one thousand elephants, his elaborate palaces, and his sophisticated diplomatic correspondence with European powers all served to project an image of Aceh as a major power deserving of respect.[^71] This maintenance of prestige may have helped delay more aggressive European colonial encroachment.

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptical historians highlight several problematic aspects of Iskandar Thani's reign and legacy.

**Religious Intolerance and Intellectual Destruction**: The most serious and sustained criticism concerns Iskandar Thani's support for Nuruddin ar-Raniri's violent suppression of the wujudiyya Sufi tradition. Modern scholars of Islamic mysticism and Southeast Asian intellectual history view the burning of Hamzah al-Fansuri's and Syamsuddin al-Sumatrani's works as a tragic loss of an important mystical tradition.[^72] The execution and persecution of wujudiyya followers represents religious intolerance that stands in stark contrast to the pluralistic Sufi traditions that had previously flourished in Aceh.[^73] Recent scholarship, including Foucauldian analyses of the Hamzah Fansuri-Nuruddin ar-Raniri debate, examines how theological disputes became politicized and weaponized for power consolidation.[^74]

**Strategic Failures in Foreign Policy**: Critics point to Iskandar Thani's failure to support the Dutch against Malacca as a significant missed opportunity. Had Aceh participated in the conquest of Malacca, the sultanate might have gained influence over this strategically crucial port or at least earned substantial concessions from the Dutch.[^75] Instead, Aceh's absence from the campaign allowed Johor and the VOC to establish their positions without Acehnese involvement. Some historians view Iskandar Thani's obsession with excluding Johor from the alliance as allowing personal rivalry to override strategic interests.

**Decline from Iskandar Muda's Legacy**: Inevitably, Iskandar Thani suffers by comparison with his legendary predecessor. Iskandar Muda had expanded Aceh's power throughout Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula, commanded respect and fear from European and Asian powers alike, and made Aceh one of the most formidable states in Southeast Asia.[^76] Iskandar Thani's inability to continue this military expansion, though understandable given the 1629 disaster, represents a clear decline in Acehnese power and influence. The fact that the orang kaya immediately reasserted their power after his death suggests his centralization efforts were more personal than institutional, failing to create lasting structures that could survive his passing.

**Brevity and Limited Transformation**: Perhaps most fundamentally, critics note that Iskandar Thani's five-year reign was simply too short to accomplish significant transformation. Unlike his predecessor's 29-year reign (1607-1636), which allowed for sustained policy implementation and institutional development, Iskandar Thani barely had time to consolidate power before his untimely death at age 31.[^77] What might have been accomplished with a longer reign remains a matter of speculation, but the brevity itself represents a failure to establish lasting change.
