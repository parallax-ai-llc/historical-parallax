## Summary

Marie Tharp was an American geologist and oceanographic cartographer who created the first comprehensive map of the ocean floor. Her mapping of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge revealed the rift valley running along its center, providing crucial evidence for plate tectonics and continental drift. Her work, done with Bruce Heezen, transformed our understanding of ocean geology. She is considered one of the most important cartographers of the 20th century.
