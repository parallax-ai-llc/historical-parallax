## Summary

Abraham (originally Abram) is one of the most significant figures in religious history, revered as the founding patriarch of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Born in Ur of the Chaldees in ancient Mesopotamia around 2150 BCE, he is believed to have received a divine calling to leave his homeland and establish a covenant with God that would make his descendants "as numerous as the stars."[^1] His willingness to follow God's commands, including the near-sacrifice of his son Isaac, established him as the archetypal figure of faith and obedience in monotheistic traditions.[^2] Abraham's life narrative, primarily documented in the Book of Genesis, represents a pivotal transition from polytheistic ancient Near Eastern religion to ethical monotheism, though the historicity of his existence remains debated among scholars.[^3] His legacy extends across millennia, influencing billions of adherents of the Abrahamic faiths and shaping Western and Middle Eastern civilization.

## Early Life and Background

According to biblical and traditional accounts, Abraham was born as Abram in the city of Ur, located in southern Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), during the early second millennium BCE.[^4] He was the son of Terah, a descendant of Noah's son Shem, and lived in a sophisticated urban civilization known for its ziggurats, advanced mathematics, and polytheistic religious practices.[^5] The Mesopotamian context of Abraham's early life was characterized by worship of multiple deities, particularly the moon god Sin, who was the patron deity of Ur.[^6]

Traditional Jewish sources, including the Midrash, elaborate on Abraham's youth with narratives not found in the biblical text, depicting him as questioning the idolatry practiced by his family and society.[^7] One famous account describes the young Abraham smashing his father Terah's idols and attributing the destruction to the largest idol, demonstrating through irony that lifeless statues could not be gods.[^8] While these rabbinic stories are not historical records, they reflect the theological importance placed on Abraham's monotheistic insight.

The Book of Genesis reports that Terah took his family, including Abram, his wife Sarai (later Sarah), and his nephew Lot, from Ur to Haran (in modern-day Turkey), where they settled.[^9] Haran was another major center of moon-god worship, suggesting that the family's relocation may have been part of a migration pattern common in that era.[^10] Scholarly theories propose various reasons for this migration, including economic opportunities, political instability, or participation in the widespread Amorite movements of the period.[^11]

Archaeologically, the period traditionally associated with Abraham (approximately 2100-1900 BCE, the Middle Bronze Age) was marked by significant population movements, the decline of the Ur III dynasty, and the rise of competing city-states throughout Mesopotamia and the Levant.[^12] While no direct archaeological evidence confirms Abraham's existence, the biblical narrative's geographical and cultural details align with what is known about the ancient Near East during this period.[^13]

## Rise to Prominence

Abraham's transformation from an obscure Mesopotamian into the patriarch of nations began with what is described as a divine revelation. According to Genesis 12:1-3, God commanded Abram to leave his country, his kindred, and his father's house to go to a land that would be shown to him, promising to make him a great nation, bless him, make his name great, and make him a blessing to all families of the earth.[^14] This call, received when Abram was 75 years old, represents the foundational moment of the Abrahamic covenant and the beginning of salvation history in biblical theology.[^15]

Responding to this divine summons, Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all their possessions and traveled to the land of Canaan.[^16] Upon arriving, he built altars to God at Shechem and between Bethel and Ai, establishing these locations as places of worship and marking the land as promised territory.[^17] This pattern of altar-building throughout Canaan served both religious and territorial purposes, symbolically claiming the land through sacred markers.[^18]

Abraham's prominence grew through a series of dramatic events that demonstrated both his faith and his resourcefulness. When famine struck Canaan, he traveled to Egypt, where his wealth increased substantially, though this episode also revealed moral complexity as he presented his wife as his sister to protect himself, leading to her being taken into Pharaoh's household until divine intervention secured her release.[^19] This morally ambiguous story appears twice more in the Abraham narrative with variations, suggesting it may have served as a type-scene exploring themes of vulnerability and divine protection.[^20]

A defining moment in Abraham's rise occurred when he led a military expedition to rescue Lot, who had been captured by a coalition of eastern kings led by Chedorlaomer.[^21] With only 318 trained men from his household, Abraham pursued the captors to Dan and beyond Damascus, defeated them, and recovered all the people and goods.[^22] This military victory established Abraham as a significant power in the region, earning him respect from local kings and demonstrating that he was more than a pastoral nomad—he was a formidable leader with substantial resources and military capability.[^23]

Following this victory, Abraham encountered Melchizedek, the mysterious king of Salem (later identified with Jerusalem) and "priest of God Most High," who blessed Abraham and received a tenth of the spoils, establishing an early precedent for tithing.[^24] Abraham's refusal to accept wealth from the king of Sodom immediately after this encounter demonstrated his independence and unwillingness to be indebted to local powers, preserving his unique relationship with God as his sole benefactor.[^25]

## Major Achievements

Abraham's most significant achievement was the establishment of the covenant relationship between God and his descendants, forming the theological foundation for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[^26] The covenant was progressively revealed through multiple divine encounters. In Genesis 15, God formally promised Abraham innumerable descendants and the land of Canaan, ratifying the covenant through an ancient ritual involving divided animals, where a smoking fire pot and flaming torch (representing divine presence) passed between the pieces.[^27] This ceremony employed the standard ancient Near Eastern treaty formula, making the covenant legally and culturally recognizable to Abraham's contemporaries.[^28]

The covenant was further developed in Genesis 17, when God changed Abram's name to Abraham ("father of a multitude") and Sarai's to Sarah ("princess"), instituted circumcision as the permanent sign of the covenant, and promised that Sarah herself would bear the long-awaited son despite her advanced age.[^29] The requirement of circumcision established a physical mark distinguishing Abraham's descendants from surrounding peoples and became central to Jewish identity.[^30] This covenant explicitly promised that Abraham would be the father of many nations, that kings would descend from him, and that God would maintain an everlasting covenant with his offspring.[^31]

Abraham's greatest test of faith, known as the Akedah or "Binding of Isaac," represents both the pinnacle of his obedience and one of the most theologically complex narratives in Scripture.[^32] God commanded Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, the son of promise, on Mount Moriah, creating an apparent contradiction with all previous divine promises.[^33] Abraham's willingness to obey, proceeding with preparations until an angel stopped him at the last moment and provided a ram as substitute, demonstrated absolute trust in God's character and purposes even when divine commands seemed contradictory.[^34] This event profoundly influenced Jewish thought, Christian theology (as a prefigurement of Christ's sacrifice), and Islamic tradition (where the son is identified as Ishmael in most interpretations).[^35]

Abraham's diplomatic and negotiation skills are exemplified in his intercession for Sodom and Gomorrah, where he engaged in a remarkable dialogue with God, progressively negotiating down the number of righteous people required to save the cities from destruction.[^36] This narrative presents Abraham as a champion of justice who dared to question divine judgment with the famous challenge: "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do what is just?"[^37] Though the negotiation ultimately failed to save the cities due to insufficient righteous inhabitants, the episode establishes an important biblical principle of human moral reasoning with God.[^38]

Abraham's purchase of the cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite for 400 shekels of silver to bury Sarah represents his first legal ownership of land in Canaan, fulfilling in small measure the promise of territorial inheritance.[^39] The detailed negotiation process recorded in Genesis 23 reflects authentic ancient Near Eastern business practices and established a hereditary burial site that remains significant to Jews, Christians, and Muslims today.[^40] The cave in Hebron became the burial place for Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, Jacob, and Leah, making it one of the most contested religious sites in the world.[^41]

Abraham's establishment of monotheistic worship influenced not only his immediate descendants but set a pattern that would ultimately transform human religious consciousness.[^42] By rejecting the polytheistic practices of Mesopotamia and Canaan, Abraham initiated a religious revolution that emphasized ethical monotheism, divine election, covenant relationship, and faith-based righteousness rather than ritualistic appeasement of multiple deities.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his revered status, the Abraham narratives contain elements that have generated significant criticism and theological difficulty across centuries of interpretation. The most frequently criticized aspect of Abraham's character is his repeated willingness to endanger his wife Sarah by claiming she was his sister to protect himself when entering foreign territories.[^44] This deception occurred in Egypt with Pharaoh (Genesis 12), with Abimelech king of Gerar (Genesis 20), and was later repeated by Isaac with Rebekah (Genesis 26), suggesting a problematic pattern of self-preservation at the expense of female vulnerability.[^45]

Modern feminist biblical scholarship has particularly critiqued these narratives as examples of patriarchal structures that commodified women and subordinated their safety to male interests.[^46] Sarah is portrayed as having no agency in these decisions, being twice taken into foreign harems, and the biblical text offers no explicit condemnation of Abraham's actions, though divine intervention and foreign rulers' ethical responses implicitly critique his behavior.[^47] Some scholars argue these stories preserve ancient traditions that honestly depicted the moral complexity of their ancestors rather than idealizing them, while others see them as reflective of oppressive social structures that biblical religion failed to sufficiently challenge.[^48]

The treatment of Hagar and Ishmael represents another ethically troubling dimension of the Abraham narrative. At Sarah's instigation, Abraham used Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian slave, as a surrogate to produce an heir, resulting in Ishmael's birth.[^49] When Sarah later conceived Isaac, she demanded that Abraham expel Hagar and Ishmael to protect Isaac's inheritance rights.[^50] Abraham complied after receiving divine assurance that Ishmael would also become a great nation, but the narrative depicts Hagar and the child wandering in the wilderness of Beersheba, nearly dying of thirst before divine intervention saved them.[^51]

This episode has generated substantial criticism regarding Abraham's treatment of his son Ishmael and the slave woman Hagar. Islamic tradition, which honors Ishmael as a prophet and ancestor of Muhammad, naturally presents a more favorable view of Ishmael's status, while also criticizing aspects of how the biblical tradition subordinated him to Isaac.[^52] Contemporary readers often find Abraham's willingness to send a woman and child into the desert with minimal provisions morally reprehensible, regardless of divine reassurance.[^53] Womanist theology has particularly engaged with Hagar's story as representative of the experiences of oppressed women who suffer under intersecting systems of patriarchy, slavery, and ethnic hierarchy.[^54]

The Akedah, while celebrated as the supreme test of faith, has also been the subject of intense criticism and philosophical challenge. Søren Kierkegaard's "Fear and Trembling" explored the "teleological suspension of the ethical" required for Abraham's obedience, acknowledging that by normal moral standards, Abraham's willingness to kill his son would constitute murder and moral monstrosity.[^55] The Danish philosopher struggled with how faith could demand actions that violate universal ethical principles, creating tension between religious obedience and moral reasoning that remains unresolved.[^56]

Some biblical scholars and theologians have questioned whether God would actually command child sacrifice, suggesting instead that the narrative may represent a polemic against Canaanite child sacrifice practices, with Abraham learning that his God, unlike the gods of surrounding peoples, does not desire human sacrifice.[^57] Others interpret the story as addressing the ancient practice of offering the firstborn to deity, with the provision of the ram establishing the principle of animal substitution for human sacrifice.[^58] Regardless of interpretation, the story's apparent divine command to kill an innocent child remains deeply disturbing to many readers and has been used historically to justify blind obedience to religious authority, sometimes with catastrophic consequences.[^59]

From a historical-critical perspective, the Abraham narratives have been criticized as lacking archaeological corroboration, with many scholars viewing the patriarch stories as later literary constructions that retroject monotheistic theology into an earlier period.[^60] The complete absence of contemporary Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Canaanite records mentioning Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob has led many historians to question whether these figures were historical individuals or rather legendary ancestors created to provide ethnic and theological origins for later Israelite identity.[^61] The archaeological record of Canaan in the Middle Bronze Age shows continuity of Canaanite culture rather than evidence of incoming patriarchal clans, though absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence given the limits of archaeological preservation for pastoral nomadic peoples.[^62]

## Personal Life

The most prominent relationship in Abraham's life was with his wife Sarah (originally Sarai), who is described as both his wife and his half-sister, sharing the same father but different mothers.[^63] Their marriage, while producing no children for decades, represents a partnership of faith as they jointly left their homeland and journeyed to Canaan.[^64] Sarah is portrayed as beautiful enough in her sixties and beyond to attract foreign kings, possessing strong agency in household decisions (particularly regarding Hagar and Ishmael), and experiencing her own divine encounters, including the angelic announcement of Isaac's birth that prompted her famous laughter of disbelief.[^65]

The long period of childlessness—Sarah remained barren until age 90—created profound tension in their relationship and motivated Sarah's decision to give her servant Hagar to Abraham as a surrogate.[^66] This practice, while deeply problematic by modern standards, was legally sanctioned in ancient Near Eastern cultures as evidenced by parallel examples in Mesopotamian legal codes and the Nuzi tablets.[^67] The arrangement created a rivalry between Sarah and Hagar, with Sarah treating Hagar harshly enough that she temporarily fled before an angel commanded her to return and submit.[^68]

Abraham's relationship with Hagar is depicted minimally but significantly. She bore him Ishmael when Abraham was 86 years old, thirteen years before Isaac's birth.[^69] The text provides little insight into Abraham's emotional response to Ishmael or his feelings about expelling them, though his distress at Sarah's demand is noted, and he sent them away only after God promised to care for Ishmael and make him a great nation.[^70] Islamic tradition presents a much more elaborate relationship, with Abraham visiting Hagar and Ishmael in the Arabian desert and, together with his son, building the Kaaba in Mecca.[^71]

Isaac, the long-awaited son born when Abraham was 100 years old, represented the fulfillment of divine promise and the continuation of the covenant line.[^72] Abraham's love for Isaac is implied in God's instruction to sacrifice "your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love," and the near-sacrifice experience must have profoundly affected their relationship, though the biblical text maintains silence on Isaac's psychological response or subsequent interaction with his father.[^73] Abraham arranged Isaac's marriage to Rebekah through his servant, maintaining the family's Mesopotamian connections by seeking a wife from among his relatives in Haran rather than from the local Canaanite population.[^74]

After Sarah's death, Abraham married Keturah (or took her as a concubine, depending on the text), who bore him six additional sons: Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.[^75] These sons became ancestors of various Arabian tribes, particularly the Midianites, establishing Abraham's legacy beyond the covenant line of Isaac.[^76] Abraham gave gifts to these sons but sent them away eastward, ensuring Isaac's position as primary heir, a pattern similar to his earlier treatment of Ishmael.[^77]

Abraham's personality, as portrayed in biblical narrative, combined faith with pragmatism, hospitality with shrewd negotiation, and obedience with boldness to question God. The elaborate welcome he provided to three mysterious visitors (later revealed to have divine nature), preparing an extensive meal with the finest ingredients, established him as the exemplar of hospitality in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic tradition.[^78] His willingness to negotiate with God over Sodom's fate revealed a man who believed in divine justice and felt empowered to engage in moral dialogue with deity.[^79] Yet his deceptions regarding Sarah and his acquiescence to harsh treatment of Hagar show moral limitations and cultural conditioning that the biblical text preserves without explicit judgment, leaving readers to grapple with a flawed but faithful protagonist.[^80]

## Legacy

Abraham's legacy extends across religious, cultural, and political dimensions, influencing billions of people over more than three millennia. As the patriarch of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam—collectively known as the Abrahamic religions—he represents perhaps the single most influential religious figure in human history, with over 4 billion adherents claiming spiritual descent from him.[^81]

In Judaism, Abraham is the first of the three patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), the original recipient of God's covenant promises, and the father of the Jewish people through Isaac and Jacob.[^82] His willingness to follow God's command to leave his homeland established the pattern of Jewish exile and return, his circumcision covenant remains central to Jewish identity, and his argumentation with God over Sodom provided a model for wrestling with divine justice.[^83] The binding of Isaac is read annually on Rosh Hashanah, serving as a reminder of supreme faith and God's provision, while also being invoked historically during periods of Jewish martyrdom.[^84] Rabbinic literature extensively elaborates Abraham's character, depicting him as discovering monotheism through reason, observing Torah commandments before they were given, and exemplifying virtues like hospitality (the open tent on all sides) and loving-kindness.[^85]

Christianity interprets Abraham primarily through the lens of faith, particularly influenced by Paul's letters in the New Testament. Paul argues in Romans 4 and Galatians 3 that Abraham was justified by faith before he was circumcised, making him the father of all who believe, both Jews and Gentiles.[^86] This interpretation made Abraham central to Christian theology of salvation by grace through faith rather than by works of law.[^87] The Letter to the Hebrews presents Abraham as the exemplar of faith who "went out, not knowing where he was going," trusting God's promises even when they seemed impossible.[^88] Jesus identified himself with Abraham ("before Abraham was, I am"), and Christian theology sees the Akedah as a typological prefigurement of God sacrificing his own Son.[^89]

In Islam, Abraham (Ibrahim) is considered one of the most important prophets, a hanif (pure monotheist) who rejected the idolatry of his people, and the ancestor of Muhammad through Ishmael.[^90] The Quran mentions Abraham repeatedly, emphasizing his strict monotheism, his breaking of his father's idols, his willingness to sacrifice his son (generally interpreted as Ishmael in Islamic tradition), and his building of the Kaaba with Ishmael in Mecca.[^91] The Hajj pilgrimage rituals reenact events from Abraham's life, including the walking between Safa and Marwa hills (commemorating Hagar's search for water) and the symbolic stoning of Satan (commemorating Abraham's rejection of temptation during the sacrifice).[^92] Muslims celebrate Eid al-Adha, the Festival of Sacrifice, annually in commemoration of Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son.[^93]

Abraham's legacy extends beyond religious tradition into political and cultural spheres. The covenant promise that Abraham's descendants would inherit the land from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates has been invoked throughout history in territorial claims, most recently in Israeli-Palestinian conflicts where both sides claim Abrahamic descent and inheritance rights.[^94] The city of Hebron, where Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah, remains a flashpoint of religious and ethnic tension, with the site holy to Jews as the Tomb of the Patriarchs and to Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque.[^95]

In interfaith dialogue, Abraham serves as a potential unifying figure among the three major monotheistic traditions, though this potential is complicated by different interpretations of his legacy and the covenant promises.[^96] The concept of "Abrahamic religions" itself, while useful for highlighting common origins, can obscure significant theological differences and has been criticized by some scholars as overly simplistic or as a modern construct that doesn't reflect how these religions historically viewed their relationships.[^97]

Abraham's influence on Western civilization extends to legal, ethical, and philosophical domains. The covenant concept influenced Western legal theory regarding binding agreements and contractual obligations.[^98] The ethical monotheism Abraham represents—the idea of a single God who demands moral behavior rather than mere ritual observance—profoundly shaped Western moral philosophy.[^99] The tension between divine command and ethical reasoning exemplified in the Akedah has occupied philosophers from Kierkegaard to Kant to contemporary ethicists exploring the foundations of moral obligation.[^100]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Traditional Jewish, Christian, and Islamic scholarship has overwhelmingly presented Abraham in heroic terms as the father of faith, the friend of God, and the exemplar of obedience and righteousness. Medieval Jewish commentators like Rashi, Maimonides, and Nachmanides defended Abraham's actions even when problematic, finding moral lessons and theological depth in apparent ethical difficulties.[^101] Maimonides, in his "Guide for the Perplexed," presented Abraham as a philosopher who arrived at monotheistic truth through rational contemplation of the cosmos, combining faith with reason.[^102]

Christian theologians from Augustine through Aquinas to contemporary scholars have praised Abraham's faith as the model for Christian believers. Augustine saw in Abraham the prototype of those justified by faith, while Aquinas analyzed his faith as including intellectual assent, trust, and obedient action.[^103] Modern Christian scholarship, particularly from evangelical and conservative Catholic perspectives, continues to uphold Abraham as demonstrating perfect faith, with the difficulties in his narrative attributed to cultural contexts that modern readers misunderstand or to pedagogical purposes in Scripture that intentionally present flawed heroes to highlight divine grace.[^104]

Islamic tradition holds Abraham in supreme regard as the khalil Allah (friend of God) and as a prophet who received divine revelation and perfectly submitted to God's will.[^105] Islamic scholars praise Abraham's radical monotheism, his courage in confronting his idolatrous community, his construction of the Kaaba as a house for the worship of the one true God, and his willingness to sacrifice his son as the ultimate expression of submission (islam) to divine command.[^106]

Many modern biblical scholars, even those employing historical-critical methods, acknowledge the literary power and theological significance of the Abraham narratives. Gerhard von Rad praised the stories as "unsurpassed in the whole of world literature" for their ability to convey theological profundity through deceptively simple narrative.[^107] Scholars like Jon Levenson have defended the Akedah as a sophisticated theological narrative addressing ancient concerns about child sacrifice while establishing principles of divine testing, obedient faith, and substitutionary sacrifice.[^108]

From a historical perspective, some scholars defend the plausibility of a historical kernel behind the Abraham traditions, arguing that the detailed knowledge of Middle Bronze Age culture, geography, and customs reflected in the narratives suggests authentic ancient traditions, even if they were shaped and theologized over centuries of transmission.[^109] The personal names in the Abraham narrative (Abram/Abraham, Jacob, Benjamin) appear in ancient Near Eastern texts from the appropriate period, supporting the antiquity of the traditions even if not proving the historicity of specific individuals.[^110]

Contemporary interfaith advocates celebrate Abraham as a unifying figure who can bring together Jews, Christians, and Muslims around common values of monotheism, faith, hospitality, and ethical concern for justice.[^111] The "Abrahamic family reunion" concept has inspired numerous dialogue initiatives seeking to leverage shared heritage to overcome religious conflict.[^112]

### Negative Views

Historical-critical biblical scholarship, particularly since the Enlightenment, has raised substantial questions about Abraham's historicity and the reliability of the biblical narratives. Julius Wellhausen and the documentary hypothesis tradition argued that the Abraham stories were literary creations of the monarchic or exilic periods, projected back into an imagined ancestral past to legitimate later Israelite territorial claims and religious practices.[^113] This critical approach views Abraham not as a historical figure but as a legendary or mythological character created to personify Israelite origins.[^114]

Many contemporary biblical historians, including Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman, argue that archaeology provides no support for the biblical patriarchal narratives, and that the stories reflect the sociopolitical concerns of their authors in the first millennium BCE rather than preserving authentic second-millennium traditions.[^115] Thomas Thompson's influential work "The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives" concluded that the Abraham stories are best understood as literary fiction rather than historical memory.[^116]

Feminist biblical scholars have offered sustained critique of the patriarchal structures embedded in the Abraham narratives and their ongoing negative influence. Phyllis Trible's work on the "texts of terror" included analysis of Hagar's abuse, arguing that the text preserves stories of victimized women within patriarchal structures, with Sarah and Abraham both complicit in Hagar's oppression.[^117] Feminist interpreters criticize how Abraham's story privileges male lineage and inheritance, commodifies women as reproductive vessels, and normalizes the endangerment of women for male self-protection.[^118]

Womanist theologians, particularly Delores Williams, have focused critical attention on the Hagar narrative as depicting the intersection of gender, race, and class oppression, with Hagar as a surrogate slave mother whose experience parallels that of enslaved African-American women who were sexually exploited by masters.[^119] This reading indicts both Abraham and Sarah, and by extension the biblical tradition, for legitimating exploitation and abandonment of the vulnerable.[^120]

Ethical philosophers and theologians have struggled with the moral implications of the Akedah, with some concluding that no good God would command child sacrifice and that religious traditions that celebrate such obedience may foster dangerous authoritarianism and the suspension of moral reasoning.[^121] Emmanuel Levinas argued that ethics must precede and limit religious obligation, implicitly criticizing the tradition's celebration of Abraham's willingness to override ethical bonds to his son in favor of religious obedience.[^122]

Postcolonial biblical critics have examined how the Abraham narratives, particularly the promises of land, have been used to justify colonialism, displacement of indigenous peoples, and ongoing Israeli settlement policies in the West Bank.[^123] The narrative of divine land promises to Abraham's descendants has been critiqued as a religious legitimation of territorial conquest and ethnic displacement that has caused immense suffering.[^124]

Psychoanalytic approaches have sometimes portrayed Abraham negatively, with the Akedah interpreted as psychological abuse of Isaac and evidence of religious pathology. Some psychologists have suggested that if a contemporary person claimed God commanded them to kill their child, they would be considered mentally ill, questioning why ancient Abraham's similar claim is celebrated as supreme faith.[^125]

Interfaith critics argue that rather than uniting the Abrahamic religions, Abraham actually represents a source of division, as each tradition claims him exclusively and interprets his legacy in contradictory ways, with competing claims to inheritance, covenant, and land promises fueling rather than resolving religious conflict.[^126]
