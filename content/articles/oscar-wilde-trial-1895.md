## Overview

In 1895, Oscar Wilde was the most celebrated playwright in London (*The Importance of Being Earnest* was a smash hit). Within weeks, he was a convict aimed for the treadmill. Wilde foolishly sued the Marquess of Queensberry (father of his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas) for libel after Queensberry left a card calling him a "somdomite" [sic]. The libel trial collapsed when evidence of Wilde's affairs with rent boys emerged. The Crown then prosecuted *him*. It was the celebrity trial of the century, pitting art against Victorian morality.

## "The Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name"

During the trial, the prosecutor asked about a poem by Lord Alfred Douglas.
**Q:** "What is the 'Love that dare not speak its name'?"
**Wilde:** "It is that deep, spiritual affection that is as pure as it is perfect... It is beautiful, it is fine, it is the noblest form of affection. There is nothing unnatural about it."
The courtroom erupted in applause (and hisses).

## The Sentence

Wilde was found guilty of "gross indecency."
The judge called it "the worst case I have ever tried" and gave the maximum sentence: **Two years hard labor**.
**Reading Gaol:**
Wilde was broken by the prison regime (treadmill, silence, hunger).
He wrote *De Profundis* (a bitter letter to his lover) in his cell.

## Aftermath

Released in 1897, he fled to France, bankrupt and broken.
He died three years later in a cheap Paris hotel (L'Hotel), famously saying: *"My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One or the other of us has to go."*
(It is now believed he died of meningitis caused by a chronic ear infection).
