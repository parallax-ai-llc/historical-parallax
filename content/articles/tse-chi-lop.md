## Summary
Tse Chi Lop was a Chinese-Canadian drug lord who led an Asian drug syndicate known as 'The Company' or 'Sam Gor' that was responsible for up to 70% of the methamphetamine in the Asia-Pacific region. He was called 'Asia's El Chapo.' He was arrested in the Netherlands in 2021.

## Early Life
Born in Guangzhou, China, around 1963. He moved to Canada and became a Canadian citizen. He was previously convicted of heroin trafficking in the US and served nine years in prison. After release, he relocated to Asia and built his drug empire. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Tse led the Sam Gor syndicate, a transnational drug network operating across Southeast Asia. His organization was estimated to generate $17 billion annually in methamphetamine sales. The syndicate's production was based in Myanmar's Shan State. He maintained a low profile while running one of the world's largest drug operations. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Tse was arrested at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on January 22, 2021, on an Australian arrest warrant. He was extradited to Australia in 2024 to face drug trafficking charges. His arrest was the result of a multi-year international investigation. [^3]
