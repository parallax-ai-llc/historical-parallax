## Overview

Al Capone, known as "Scarface," was the most infamous gangster in American history. As the boss of the Chicago Outfit during the Prohibition era (1920-1933), he built a criminal empire based on bootlegging whiskey, illegal gambling, and prostitution. He ruled Chicago with an iron fist and bribes, earning celebrity status as a "modern-day Robin Hood" while ordering brutal hits like the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. Despite being responsible for countless murders, he was famously untouchable ("The Uncatchable") until the federal government convicted him on the mundane charge of income tax evasion in 1931.
