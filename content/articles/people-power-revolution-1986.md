## Summary

The People Power Revolution (Rebolusyong Lakas ng Bayan), also known as the EDSA Revolution or the February Revolution, was a four-day campaign of nonviolent civil resistance that ended the 20-year authoritarian rule of President Ferdinand Marcos and restored democracy to the Philippines. From February 22-25, 1986, millions of Filipinos gathered on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) in Metro Manila, forming human barricades to protect military defectors and demonstrating peaceful opposition to the regime.[^1]

The revolution was sparked by the fraudulent February 7, 1986 snap election, in which Marcos was declared the winner despite overwhelming evidence that opposition candidate Corazon "Cory" Aquino had actually won. When Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Philippine Constabulary Chief Fidel Ramos withdrew their support from Marcos, Cardinal Jaime Sin called on the Filipino people to protect them through nonviolent resistance. Over the next four days, unarmed civilians faced down tanks with prayers and flowers.[^2]

On February 25, 1986, Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii aboard US Air Force helicopters, and Corazon Aquino was inaugurated as the 11th President of the Philippines. The People Power Revolution became an inspiration for nonviolent movements worldwide—including the fall of communist regimes in Eastern Europe in 1989—and established the template for "color revolutions" that would follow in subsequent decades.[^3]

## Historical Background

### The Marcos Dictatorship (1965-1986)

Ferdinand Marcos was elected president in 1965 and won a second term in 1969. Facing constitutional term limits, he declared martial law on September 21, 1972, claiming it was necessary to suppress communist insurgency and maintain order. Martial law would last until 1981, but Marcos continued authoritarian rule through various legal mechanisms.[^4]

**Key features of the Marcos regime:**

- **Constitutional Manipulation:** 1973 constitution gave Marcos near-unlimited powers
- **Political Repression:** Thousands arrested, tortured, or killed; media controlled
- **Crony Capitalism:** Marcos family and associates amassed enormous wealth (estimated $5-10 billion)
- **Human Rights Violations:** Documented torture, disappeared persons, political prisoners
- **Military Rule:** Armed forces became tool of regime maintenance[^5]

### Ninoy Aquino: From Opponent to Martyr

**Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr.** was the primary opposition leader:

- Senator, potential presidential candidate
- Arrested under martial law in 1972
- Sentenced to death (commuted), imprisoned for years
- Released in 1980 for heart surgery in the US
- Lived in exile in Boston[^6]

### The Assassination (August 21, 1983)

On August 21, 1983, Ninoy Aquino returned to the Philippines despite warnings that his life was in danger. As he descended from the plane at Manila International Airport, he was shot in the head and killed on the tarmac. A supposed "communist assassin" was immediately killed by soldiers, but Filipinos did not believe the official story.[^7]

**Impact of the Assassination:**

- Massive public outrage
- Millions attended Ninoy's funeral procession
- Economic crisis deepened
- Anti-Marcos sentiment exploded
- Corazon Aquino emerged as opposition leader[^8]

---

## Road to Revolution

### Growing Opposition (1983-1985)

After Ninoy's assassination:

- "Noise barrages" (confetti-throwing protests) became common
- Business community turned against Marcos
- Catholic Church became openly critical
- Economic crisis worsened; peso collapsed
- International pressure mounted from the US and others[^9]

### The Snap Election (February 7, 1986)

Under pressure from the US Reagan administration, Marcos called a surprise ("snap") presidential election for February 7, 1986. Corazon Aquino—Ninoy's widow, with no prior political experience—became the unified opposition candidate.[^10]

**Election Day:**

- NAMFREL (citizen election watchdog) documented massive fraud
- Vote-buying, ballot-stuffing, intimidation widespread
- Electronic vote count showed Aquino winning, then transmission cut
- COMELEC technicians walked out in protest
- Marcos declared winner by official count[^11]

### The Catholic Bishops' Statement

On February 13, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) issued a historic pastoral letter:

> "...a government that assumes or retains power through fraudulent means has no moral basis... the people have a serious obligation to make it known that the government does not enjoy their support."[^12]

This was an extraordinary intervention by the Church, effectively calling for nonviolent resistance.

---

## The Revolution

### February 22: The Defection

On February 22, 1986, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Vice Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos withdrew their support from Marcos and established themselves in Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame along EDSA. They called a press conference announcing their break with the regime and calling on Marcos to resign.[^13]

Enrile revealed that the 1972 assassination attempt on himself—used to justify martial law—had been staged. He admitted his own complicity in the dictatorship but declared he could no longer support it.

### Cardinal Sin's Call

That evening, Cardinal Jaime Sin addressed the nation via Radio Veritas (the Catholic Church's radio station):

> "I am calling on our people to support our two good friends.... If any of you could be around Camp Crame... please come and bring food. But I am calling for... non-violence."[^14]

Within hours, tens of thousands of Filipinos began streaming to EDSA.

### February 23-24: The Human Barricade

**Day 2-3 of the Revolution:**

- Hundreds of thousands filled EDSA
- Nuns prayed rosaries before tanks
- Civilians offered flowers and food to soldiers
- Human barricades blocked military approaches
- Several units ordered to attack refused; some defected[^15]

**Key Moments:**

- Navy helicopters defected, landing at Camp Crame
- Marines ordered to attack refused after facing nuns and children
- Radio Veritas bombed; Radio Bandido took over broadcasts
- Crowds reached an estimated 2 million people[^16]

### February 25: Two Inaugurations

On February 25, 1986, two presidential inaugurations took place:

**Morning:** Corazon Aquino was sworn in as President at Club Filipino in Greenhills, with massive crowds celebrating.

**Noon:** Ferdinand Marcos held his own inauguration at Malacañang Palace, but the ceremony was nearly empty.

**Evening:** US officials informed Marcos he had lost American support. That night, Marcos and his family were evacuated to Clark Air Base, then flown to Hawaii. The Marcos era was over.[^17]

## Death Toll

The People Power Revolution was remarkably nonviolent:

- **No officially recorded deaths during the four-day revolution**
- Some minor injuries from isolated incidents
- No major violent confrontations
- Troops repeatedly refused orders to fire

This near-total absence of bloodshed—despite the presence of tanks, armed soldiers, and millions of civilians—made EDSA unique among revolutions and contributed to its global symbolic power.[^18]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

**Triumph of Nonviolence:** People Power demonstrated that determined, disciplined nonviolent resistance could overthrow even entrenched dictatorships. The moral power of nuns and children facing down tanks became an enduring image of civilian courage.[^19]

**Restoration of Democracy:** The revolution ended 14 years of authoritarian rule and restored democratic institutions, including a new constitution (1987) with strong human rights protections and presidential term limits.[^20]

**Global Inspiration:** EDSA directly inspired the "color revolutions" and nonviolent movements of subsequent decades—including Eastern European revolutions of 1989, Burma's Saffron Revolution, and others.[^21]

### Critical Views

**Incomplete Revolution:** Critics argue that EDSA was primarily an elite transition that preserved existing power structures. Land reform remained incomplete, oligarchic families retained power, and many Marcos cronies eventually returned to politics.[^22]

**Marcos Rehabilitation:** In subsequent decades, the Marcos family returned to political prominence. Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. was elected president in 2022, raising questions about historical memory and democratic consolidation.[^23]

**Economic Continuity:** Despite political change, economic inequality remained extreme, and many Filipinos continued to live in poverty. The "promise" of People Power remained partially unfulfilled.[^24]

---

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Philippine Democracy

The 1987 Constitution established:

- Presidential term limit (single 6-year term)
- Restored civil liberties and human rights
- Independent commissions and judiciary
- Ban on political dynasties (largely unenforced)

Democratic institutions have survived despite challenges, including coup attempts against Aquino, authoritarian tendencies under subsequent presidents, and ongoing questions about rule of law.[^25]

### EDSA II and III

The "People Power" model was invoked again:

- **EDSA II (2001):** Mass protests forced President Joseph Estrada from office
- **EDSA III (2001):** Pro-Estrada counter-protests attempted to storm Malacañang

These events raised questions about whether "people power" had become a tool for elite politics rather than genuine democratic expression.[^26]

### Global Impact

People Power influenced:

- Velvet Revolution (Czechoslovakia 1989)
- Fall of Berlin Wall (1989)
- Tiananmen protests (1989, though unsuccessful)
- Color revolutions in Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia
- Arab Spring (2011)[^27]

### Commemoration

- **February 25:** EDSA People Power Revolution Anniversary (national holiday)
- **EDSA Shrine:** Monument and church at the site
- **People Power Monument:** Commemorates the revolution
- Annual celebrations and reenactments[^28]
