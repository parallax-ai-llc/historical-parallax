## Summary

Kimura Hisashi discovered the Z-term in the variation of latitude (polar motion) in 1902, a component that could not be explained by existing theories. This discovery, known as the Kimura term, demonstrated an unexplained wobble in the Earth's axis of rotation. His precise astronomical observations advanced geodesy and geophysics.
