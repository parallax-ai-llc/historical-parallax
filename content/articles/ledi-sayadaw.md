## Summary

Ledi Sayadaw was a Burmese Theravada Buddhist monk who was one of the most important figures in the revival of vipassana meditation in Burma. He made Buddhist philosophy accessible to laypeople and encouraged them to practice meditation, breaking with the tradition that reserved intensive practice for monastics. He was also a formidable Abhidharma scholar. His lineage includes Sayagyi U Ba Khin and S. N. Goenka.
