## Summary

Andrew 'Twiggy' Forrest founded Fortescue Metals Group, which became the world's fourth-largest iron ore producer. Starting from nothing in the early 2000s, he built Fortescue into a major Australian mining company through sheer determination and against opposition from established players. He later pivoted Fortescue toward green hydrogen and renewable energy. He has donated over $2 billion through the Minderoo Foundation.
