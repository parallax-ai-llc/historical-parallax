## Summary

Jorge Paulo Lemann is a Brazilian-Swiss billionaire who co-founded 3G Capital and built a global consumer goods empire through aggressive cost-cutting and acquisitions. With partners Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira, he acquired Anheuser-Busch InBev (the world's largest brewer), Kraft Heinz, Burger King, and Tim Hortons. His zero-based budgeting management philosophy transformed the companies he acquired but also drew criticism for harsh cost-cutting.
