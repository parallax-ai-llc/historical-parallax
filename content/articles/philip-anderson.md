## Summary

Philip Anderson was an American theoretical physicist who shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics for fundamental theoretical investigations of the electronic structure of magnetic and disordered systems. His concept of Anderson localization revolutionized understanding of electronic behavior in disordered materials. His 1972 paper 'More Is Different' became a manifesto for emergence in complex systems. Anderson was also instrumental in the development of the concept of broken symmetry.
