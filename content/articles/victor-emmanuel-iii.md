## Summary

Victor Emmanuel III (1869-1947) was King of Italy from 1900 to 1946, whose nearly 46-year reign encompassed both World Wars and the rise and fall of Italian Fascism[^1]. Born to King Umberto I and Queen Margherita of Savoy, he ascended to the throne following his father's assassination in 1900[^2]. Known as the "Soldier King" after Italy's World War I victory, his legacy was ultimately tarnished by his appointment of Benito Mussolini as prime minister in 1922 and his complicity with the Fascist regime[^3]. His association with Fascism led to the monarchy's abolition in 1946, forcing him into exile where he died the following year[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Victor Emmanuel Ferdinando Maria Gennaro was born on November 11, 1869, in Naples, Italy, as the only legitimate child of Crown Prince Umberto (later King Umberto I) and Princess Margherita of Savoy[^5]. His lineage traced to the ancient House of Savoy, a dynasty founded by Humbert I "the White-Handed" around 980-1047, who secured the County of Savoy amid feudal struggles in the western Alps[^6]. From modest Alpine origins, the Savoys expanded through strategic marriages and acquisitions, gaining ducal status in the 15th century, kingship over Sardinia in 1720, and ultimately leadership in Italy's Risorgimento, with Victor Emmanuel II proclaiming the Kingdom of Italy in 1861[^7].

Victor Emmanuel's childhood was marked by physical challenges and isolation from public life. As a young boy, he suffered from physical disabilities that forced him to wear orthopedic instruments to strengthen his legs[^8]. These disabilities may have stunted his growth, as Victor Emmanuel stood only 1.52 meters (5 feet 0 inches) tall in adulthood, remarkably short even by 19th-century standards[^9]. His diminutive stature was probably due to the consanguinity of his parents, who were first cousins, as were his paternal grandparents Vittorio Emanuele II and Adelaide of Austria[^10]. His small size would later earn him unflattering nicknames including "Re tappo" (Bottle-top King) and "Sciaboletta" (little sabre)[^11].

Due to his solitary childhood, Victor Emmanuel developed a reputation for being shy and reserved, traits that would persist throughout his life[^12]. His mother, Queen Margherita, played a significant role in his early development, instilling in him a sense of duty and patriotism[^13]. Victor Emmanuel III's early education adhered to the austere Savoy dynasty traditions, prioritizing physical conditioning and moral discipline under his mother's direct oversight, which emphasized robustness and self-restraint from childhood[^14]. He studied history and law, and received military training that resulted in his holding positions of command from 1887[^15]. Despite his reserved nature, he received the traditional military upbringing expected of the Savoy family.

The only advice that his father Umberto ever gave his heir was pragmatic and revealing: "Remember: to be a king, all you need to know is how to sign your name, read a newspaper, and mount a horse"[^16]. This minimalist view of monarchy would prove inadequate preparation for the turbulent political crises Victor Emmanuel would face during his reign.

## Rise to Power

On October 24, 1896, at age 27, Victor Emmanuel married Princess Elena of Montenegro in Rome[^17]. Elena was the daughter of King Nicholas I and Queen Milena of Montenegro, and she converted to Catholicism from Orthodox Christianity at the basilica of St. Nicola in Bari before the wedding[^18]. Her mother was so distressed that Elena had changed her religion that she refused to attend the wedding ceremony in Rome[^19]. The marriage was widely seen as successful and produced five children: Yolanda (1901-1986), Mafalda (1902-1944), Umberto (1904-1983), Giovanna (1907-2000), and Maria Francesca (1914-2001)[^20].

Victor Emmanuel's ascension to the throne came suddenly and violently on July 29, 1900, when his father King Umberto I was assassinated in Monza by anarchist Gaetano Bresci[^21]. Bresci, a young weaver originally from Prato who had immigrated to the United States in 1897, swore revenge against Umberto I after learning of the Bava Beccaris massacre in 1898[^22]. Bresci fired four shots that struck the king in the chest, neck, and left thigh, killing him[^23]. At age 30, Victor Emmanuel III suddenly found himself king of Italy during a period of significant social and political upheaval.

The new king inherited a constitutional monarchy where royal power was theoretically constrained by parliament, yet Italian politics remained unstable with frequent government changes[^24]. Victor Emmanuel's early reign saw him navigate the complex parliamentary system while maintaining the traditions of the House of Savoy. His reserved and cautious personality meant he often preferred to avoid direct intervention in political crises, a pattern of behavior that would have profound consequences later in his reign.

During the first decade of his rule, Victor Emmanuel presided over a period of relative prosperity and modernization in Italy. However, the question of Italian territorial expansion and irredentism—the desire to incorporate Italian-speaking territories still under Austro-Hungarian control—remained a constant political issue that would eventually draw Italy into World War I[^25].

## Major Achievements

### World War I Leadership

Victor Emmanuel III played an important, if often overlooked, part in Italy's decision to intervene in World War I on the side of the Entente[^26]. Despite Italy's nominal membership in the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, the king personally made the crucial decision for Italy to enter the war on the Allied side in May 1915, overriding popular opposition and parliamentary resistance[^27]. When the Italian Chamber of Deputies forced Prime Minister Antonio Salandra to resign over the war issue, Victor Emmanuel intervened decisively to ensure Italian intervention, demonstrating greater political assertiveness than he would show in later crises.

During the war, Victor Emmanuel managed to solve two political crises and defend Italy's position within the Entente after the catastrophic defeat at Caporetto in October 1917[^28]. The Battle of Caporetto saw Austro-Hungarian forces, reinforced by German units, break through the Italian front line, resulting in a rout with 275,000 Italian soldiers captured—described by historian John R. Schindler as "an unprecedented catastrophe for Italian arms"[^29]. In the wake of this disaster, when French Marshal Ferdinand Foch reported the virtual lack of effective high command under Italian General Luigi Cadorna, Victor Emmanuel displayed decisive leadership by replacing Cadorna with General Armando Diaz[^30].

Victor Emmanuel then persuaded the other Allied leaders that Italy could hold the enemy at the Piave River, and he exhorted the nation and the army to rally for the defense of the Piave line[^31]. His calm demeanor and decisive action during this crisis helped stabilize the Italian military situation. Under Diaz's reformed command and with the king's support, Italian forces achieved a decisive victory at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto from October 24 to November 4, 1918, which marked the end of the war on the Italian Front and secured the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire[^32].

When victory came in November 1918, Victor Emmanuel III was saluted by General Diaz as the "Duce Supremo" who had led the nation through three years of grave sacrifices and had managed to fulfill his ancestors' mission: completing the unification of Italy[^33]. The First World War brought about Italian victory over the Habsburg Empire and the annexation of the Italian-speaking provinces of Trento and Trieste, completing the national unity of Italy, along with the southern part of German-speaking Tyrol (South Tyrol)[^34]. For this reason, Victor Emmanuel was labeled the "King of Victory" and nicknamed by Italians as "Re soldato" (Soldier King) and "Re vittorioso" (Victorious King)[^35]. In 1921, General Diaz was ennobled by King Victor Emmanuel III and given the victory title of 1st Duca della Vittoria ("Duke of the Victory")[^36].

### Scholarly Contributions to Numismatics

Beyond his political role, Victor Emmanuel III was renowned for his passion for numismatics, which was described as his "real calling" beyond his royal duties[^37]. He collected approximately 120,000 pieces, which formed the foundation for the most important publication on Italian coinage[^38]. The collection comprised more than 110,000 Italian minted coins from the medieval and modern eras, along with monetary weights, proofs, and mint scraps[^39].

Victor Emmanuel III made significant scholarly contributions through authoring the "Corpus Nummorum Italicorum" (CNI), a monumental 19-volume catalogue that remains the standard reference on Italian coinage to this day[^40]. The first volume alone, published in 1900, contained 532 pages with 5,354 catalogued coins[^41]. The Italian Numismatic Association appointed him honorary president for this achievement, and he provided studies on almost every Italian province throughout his life[^42]. He financed his coin purchases from his personal privy purse and maintained they were his private property, not family heirlooms or state property[^43]. On May 9, 1946, before going into exile, Victor Emmanuel III donated his collection to the Italian people; it was eventually transferred to the National Roman Museum in July 1971[^44].

### Territorial Expansion

During his reign, Victor Emmanuel's titles expanded significantly beyond King of Italy. Following Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935-1936, he assumed the crown as Emperor of Ethiopia on May 9, 1936[^45]. Italy proclaimed the establishment of the Italian Empire in East Africa, with Victor Emmanuel III as Emperor of Ethiopia, which was united with other Italian colonies in eastern Africa to form the new colony of Italian East Africa on June 1, 1936[^46]. The League of Nations condemned Italy's participation in this war, and the Italian claim by right of conquest to Ethiopia was rejected by some major powers, such as the United States and the Soviet Union, but was accepted by Great Britain and France in 1938[^47].

The crown of the King of the Albanians was assumed by Victor Emmanuel in 1939 when Italian forces invaded the nearly defenseless monarchy across the Adriatic Sea and caused King Zog I to flee[^48]. However, these imperial titles would prove short-lived. In November 1943, Victor Emmanuel renounced his claims to the titles of Emperor of Ethiopia and King of Albania, recognizing the previous holders of those titles as legitimate[^49].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Appointment of Mussolini and the Matteotti Crisis

The most consequential and controversial decision of Victor Emmanuel III's reign came in October 1922, when he appointed Benito Mussolini as prime minister following the March on Rome[^50]. When asked to sign a decree of martial law against the Fascist threat on the eve of the March on Rome (October 28, 1922), Victor Emmanuel refused[^51]. At this crucial moment, the king occupied a position later paralleled by Paul von Hindenburg in Germany; in both cases, the results were the same—the admission to the governing circles of Fascist dictators who would destroy democracy[^52].

King Victor Emmanuel III called Mussolini to power against the advice of his ministers[^53]. He saw Mussolini as a strong figure who could impose order over Italy and bring an end to the constant political crises[^54]. The king disapproved of Mussolini's violent tactics, but he appreciated the patriotism displayed by the Blackshirts, and he always saw the Italian Socialists and Communists as his principal enemies, feeling that Mussolini's dictatorship had saved the existing status quo in Italy[^55].

Victor Emmanuel's complicity with Fascism became even more apparent during the Matteotti Crisis of 1924. King Victor Emmanuel III failed to move against the Mussolini regime's abuses of power, including the assassination of Socialist deputy Giacomo Matteotti in June 1924[^56]. When opposition parties attempted to pressure the king through the Aventine Secession (withdrawing from parliament), he refused to intervene, affirming that "the Chamber and the Senate were his eyes and ears" and insisting on a parliamentary initiative according to the Statuto Albertino[^57]. The knowledge that the king would not dismiss the prime minister led to the Mussolini government winning a vote of no confidence in November 1924 by overwhelming margins—deputies and senators were unwilling to risk their lives voting for a no-confidence motion when the king had made it clear he would not dismiss Mussolini even if the motion carried[^58].

### Racial Laws and the Holocaust

One of the darkest chapters of Victor Emmanuel III's reign was his role in Italy's antisemitic racial laws. King Vittorio Emanuele III signed the racial laws that were introduced in Italy in 1938[^59]. These laws stripped Jews of basic civil rights, forbade them to enter into marriages with non-Jews, confiscated their property, and banned them from jobs in government and finance[^60]. From 1938 until 1943, before the German occupation and before the implementation of the "Final Solution" in Italy with the deportations towards Auschwitz, Fascist Italy enacted a comprehensive set of racial laws that were the most draconian after Germany's[^61].

During this first phase (1938-1943), under the total responsibility of the Fascist State, Italian Jews were stripped of their civil rights, removed from public life, and treated as second-class citizens[^62]. The Germans later deported 8,564 Jews from Italy, Italian-occupied France, and the islands of Rhodes and Kos, most of them to Auschwitz-Birkenau; only 1,009 returned[^63]. The king's descendant, Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy, apologized in 2021 for his ancestor's role in these events[^64]. The reinterment of Victor Emmanuel's remains in Italy in 2017 opened old wounds, with the president of the Italian Jewish community stating: "This was a king who betrayed his country"[^65].

### The Flight from Rome

Victor Emmanuel's behavior during the crucial days of September 1943 further damaged his reputation. On September 8, 1943, Victor Emmanuel publicly announced an armistice with the Allies[^66]. Following this announcement, Victor Emmanuel and his government fled south to Brindisi, fearing a German advance on Rome[^67]. Confusion reigned as Italian forces were left without orders, and the Germans, who had been expecting this move for some time, quickly disarmed and interned Italian troops and took control in the occupied Balkans, France and the Dodecanese, as well as in Italy itself[^68].

While this choice may have been necessary to protect his safety—indeed, Hitler had planned to arrest him shortly after Mussolini's overthrow—it still came as a shock to many observers inside and outside Italy[^69]. Unfavorable comparisons were drawn to King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, who refused to leave London during the Blitz, or Pope Pius XII, who mixed with Rome's crowds after bombings[^70]. The decision to abandon the capital while the nation faced its gravest crisis reinforced perceptions of Victor Emmanuel as weak and indecisive.

## Personal Life

Victor Emmanuel III married Princess Elena of Montenegro in 1896, forming what was widely regarded as a successful marriage[^71]. Queen Elena was known for being dignified but also very natural and simple, preferring a quiet family life over grand social events[^72]. She was a loving mother who wanted her children to have a normal upbringing and not feel superior because they were royals[^73]. The couple had five children: Princess Yolanda (1901-1986), who married Giorgio Carlo Calvi, Count of Bergolo; Princess Mafalda (1902-1944), who married Prince Philipp of Hesse and tragically died in Buchenwald concentration camp; Prince Umberto (1904-1983), who would briefly reign as Umberto II; Princess Giovanna (1907-2000), who married King Boris III of Bulgaria; and Princess Maria Francesca (1914-2001), who married Prince Luigi of Bourbon-Parma[^74].

Victor Emmanuel's short stature—standing at only 1.52 meters (5 feet 0 inches)—made him one of the shortest monarchs in European history[^75]. His small size contrasted dramatically with other European monarchs; one particularly striking example occurred when King Victor Emmanuel III (150cm or 4'11") met with King Christian X of Denmark (199cm or 6'7"), who were respectively the shortest and tallest European monarchs[^76]. His diminutive stature led some to perceive him as weak—Benito Mussolini himself (at 5'7") called him "too diminutive" to rule a nation as great as Italy[^77].

Despite his physical limitations and reserved personality, Victor Emmanuel was an intellectually curious man whose passion for numismatics demonstrated his scholarly inclinations[^78]. He was described as shy and withdrawn in social situations, preferring the company of books and coins to the glittering social events of court life[^79]. His relationship with Mussolini was complex: while the king privately harbored reservations about the Duce's methods, Mussolini was always very respectful and deferential when he met the king in private, which was exactly the behavior the king expected of his prime ministers[^80]. However, despite the king's appreciation for his prime minister's deference, Mussolini privately despised the king[^81].

Elena and Victor Emmanuel III went to Egypt after the 1946 referendum, where they were welcomed with great honor by King Farouk but forced to live the rest of their lives in exile[^82]. Victor Emmanuel III died a year later of pulmonary congestion in Alexandria on December 28, 1947[^83]. In December 2017, an Italian air force military plane officially repatriated the remains of Victor Emmanuel III, which were transferred from Alexandria to the Sanctuary of Vicoforte, near Turin, and interred alongside those of Elena, which had been transferred two days earlier from Montpellier, France[^84].

## Legacy

Victor Emmanuel III's legacy remains one of profound complexity and controversy. While he was a symbol of Italian continuity during a turbulent era spanning two world wars, his inability to navigate the changing political landscape ultimately led to the end of the monarchy in Italy[^85]. Historians draw a sharp contrast between his World War I performance, where he showed decisive leadership, and his behavior following that war, which lacked the character with which he acted during the conflict[^86].

The king's timidity, long complicity with Fascism, and belated reaction ensured Italy's monarchy was fatally discredited[^87]. His inability to embody national leadership during crisis made him the last effective Savoy ruler, remembered chiefly for weakness and failure[^88]. Modern historical assessments are predominantly critical of Victor Emmanuel III's reign, with scholars noting that his career demonstrates he never really came to terms with democracy and that in his few moments of meaningful political choice he preferred to deal with the representatives of savage reaction rather than concede to the demands of the people[^89].

British historian Denis Mack Smith wrote that Victor Emmanuel tended to procrastinate when faced with very difficult choices, and his unwillingness to dismiss Mussolini despite mounting pressure from within the Italian elite was his way of trying to avoid making a decision[^90]. He refused to approve Premier Luigi Facta's emergency decree against the Fascist March on Rome in 1922 and permitted Benito Mussolini to form the first fascist-led government, although the Fascists had elected only 35 members of parliament[^91]. Subsequently, his occasional complaints against Mussolini aside, Victor Emmanuel supported the Fascist dictatorship in virtually every major crisis until the Allied invasion of 1943, a course of behavior which cost him his throne in May 1946 and which facilitated Italy's abolition of the monarchy shortly thereafter[^92].

Despite his scholarly achievements in numismatics and his leadership during World War I, Victor Emmanuel III is ultimately remembered as a monarch who allowed democracy to collapse and authoritarianism to flourish[^93]. Some argue he was a product of his time and traditions, but most historians conclude that at critical moments when decisive action could have prevented catastrophe, he chose caution, procrastination, and ultimately complicity with forces that destroyed Italian democracy and brought immense suffering to his people[^94].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite the overwhelming criticism, some historians and defenders have attempted to contextualize Victor Emmanuel III's actions within the framework of constitutional monarchy and the limitations he faced. Supporters argue that as a constitutional monarch, Victor Emmanuel was constrained by the Statuto Albertino, which limited his ability to intervene directly in political affairs without parliamentary support[^95]. His decision not to declare martial law during the March on Rome in 1922 has been defended by some as adherence to constitutional principles, given that the government was supported by a large majority of the Chamber of Deputies and almost all the Senate[^96].

Victor Emmanuel's World War I leadership earned genuine praise from contemporaries and later historians. General Armando Diaz's salutation of him as the "Duce Supremo" who led the nation through three years of grave sacrifices reflected sincere appreciation for the king's steady presence and occasional decisive interventions during the war[^97]. His replacement of General Cadorna after Caporetto and his success in persuading Allied leaders that Italy could hold at the Piave demonstrated political acumen and decisive leadership when Italy's survival was at stake[^98].

His scholarly contributions to numismatics remain respected in academic circles. The "Corpus Nummorum Italicorum" continues to serve as an essential reference work, demonstrating that Victor Emmanuel possessed genuine intellectual capabilities and made lasting contributions to historical scholarship[^99]. His donation of his extensive coin collection to the Italian people before going into exile showed a gesture of generosity toward the nation that had rejected him[^100].

Some royalist historians have suggested that had Victor Emmanuel abdicated in favor of his son Umberto shortly after the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, or at the latest in 1944, the referendum result might have been different, implying that the monarchy's fall was not inevitable but rather the result of the king's personal failings rather than institutional weaknesses[^101].

### Negative Views

The scholarly consensus on Victor Emmanuel III is overwhelmingly negative. Critics emphasize that the king made conscious choices at critical moments that enabled Fascism to take root and flourish in Italy. His appointment of Mussolini in 1922, when the Fascists controlled only 35 seats in parliament, cannot be explained by constitutional constraints—it was a political choice based on his fear of socialism and his belief that Mussolini could restore order[^102].

His failure to act during the Matteotti Crisis of 1924 revealed moral bankruptcy. When a member of parliament was brutally murdered by Fascist thugs and opposition parties withdrew from parliament in protest, Victor Emmanuel had both constitutional grounds and moral obligation to intervene, yet he chose passivity[^103]. His statement that "the Chamber and the Senate were his eyes and ears" was revealed as hollow when those very institutions were subsequently destroyed by the dictatorship he enabled[^104].

The king's signature on the 1938 racial laws represents perhaps his most damning moral failure. Unlike the political complexities of 1922, the racial laws were straightforward acts of persecution based on ethnic hatred[^105]. Victor Emmanuel had the constitutional power to refuse his signature, as the Statuto Albertino required royal assent for laws to take effect. His willing participation in antisemitic persecution strips away any defense based on constitutional constraints or political necessity[^106].

Modern historians emphasize that Victor Emmanuel was not a passive victim of circumstance but an active accomplice in Fascism. The Italian monarchy and Fascist regime coexisted as a "dyarchy" with two foci of power, and the king used his remaining influence not to moderate or resist Fascism but to preserve his throne and the social order he valued[^107]. His belated dismissal of Mussolini in July 1943 came only after military defeat made Italy's position untenable, not from any principled opposition to dictatorship[^108].

His flight from Rome in September 1943, leaving the capital and the Italian military without leadership as Germany moved to occupy the country, epitomized his failures as a leader[^109]. The contrast with other European monarchs who remained with their people during crises—King George VI in London, King Christian X in Copenhagen, even Pope Pius XII in Rome—highlighted Victor Emmanuel's absence of courage when his people needed him most[^110].

The abolition of the Italian monarchy in 1946 represented a judgment not just on Victor Emmanuel personally but on the institution he represented. The referendum result—54% for the republic—demonstrated that a majority of Italians believed the monarchy was so compromised by its association with Fascism that it could not continue[^111]. Victor Emmanuel's last attempt to save the monarchy by abdicating to Umberto failed because it reminded voters of the monarchy's role during the Fascist period at precisely the moment royalists hoped voters would forget[^112].
