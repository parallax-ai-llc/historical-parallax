## Summary

Faisal I bin Hussein bin Ali al-Hashimi (1885-1933) was a seminal figure in the founding of the modern Iraqi state and a key leader of Arab nationalism during and after World War I.[^1] He led the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire alongside T.E. Lawrence, briefly ruled as King of Syria in 1920, and served as King of Iraq from 1921 until his death in 1933.[^2] His reign was marked by efforts to balance British imperial influence with Arab nationalist aspirations, successfully guiding Iraq to independence in 1932 and membership in the League of Nations.[^3] Despite his achievements in modernizing Iraq and promoting sectarian unity, Faisal remains a controversial figure, criticized both for his cooperation with colonial powers and his challenges in forging a cohesive Iraqi national identity.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Born on May 20, 1885, in Mecca, Ottoman Empire (in present-day Saudi Arabia), Faisal was the third son of Hussein bin Ali, the Grand Sharif of Mecca.[^5] His early childhood was spent in the holy city, where he began his initial studies, but his formative years would be shaped far from the Arabian Peninsula.[^6] In 1891, when Faisal was just a young child, the suspicious Ottoman Sultan moved his father Hussein to Constantinople (Istanbul) for political surveillance, bringing the entire family with him.[^7]

From approximately age eight until his early twenties, Faisal was raised and educated in the imperial capital of the Ottoman Empire.[^8] This extended period in Constantinople proved crucial to his development, as he immersed himself in the administrative and political environment at the empire's center.[^9] Though born in the spiritual heart of Islam, the young prince's primary influences lay much farther north, where he learned about leadership and administration from observing his father navigate Ottoman political intrigue.[^10]

The contrast between his birthplace in Mecca and his upbringing in Constantinople created a unique perspective that would later inform his approach to governance. He received a traditional Ottoman education while also maintaining his Arab and Hashemite identity.[^11] This dual heritage positioned him as someone who could understand both Ottoman imperial administration and Arab tribal traditions, though it would also later complicate his relationship with Iraqi populations who viewed him as an outsider.[^12]

In 1908, Faisal returned to Mecca with his father and began to gain power in the Arab world.[^13] This return to Arabia marked his transition from Ottoman-educated prince to emerging Arab leader, setting the stage for his future role in the Arab Revolt and the reshaping of the Middle East.[^14]

## Rise to Power

### The Arab Revolt (1916-1918)

Faisal's path to prominence began with his leadership role in the Great Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule during World War I. On June 10, 1916, his father Hussein bin Ali officially initiated the rebellion at Mecca, based on the McMahon-Hussein Correspondence with the United Kingdom.[^15] From 1916 to 1918, with British assistance, Faisal played a major role in the revolt against the Ottoman Empire.[^16]

In October 1916, Faisal met Captain T.E. Lawrence at Hamra in Wadi Safra, a meeting that would prove historically significant.[^17] Lawrence had been sent to identify the right leader for the Hashemite forces and to help envision an independent post-war Arabian state.[^18] Lawrence concluded that Faisal was the best candidate to lead the Revolt and became the official British liaison to him, accompanying his forces for the next two years.[^19] Faisal's role in the Arab Revolt was famously described by Lawrence in "Seven Pillars of Wisdom," though historians have questioned the accuracy of some of Lawrence's romantic portrayals.[^20]

Emir Faisal worked with the Allies during World War I in their conquest of Syria and the capture of Damascus in October 1918.[^21] This military success positioned him as the preeminent Arab nationalist leader emerging from the war.[^22]

### Brief Kingship of Syria (1920)

Following the war's end, Emir Faisal presented his case for Arab independence to the Supreme Council of the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919.[^23] He sought immediate and full independence for Arab kingdoms in Greater Syria (corresponding to modern Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority) and the Hijaz.[^24] On January 4, 1919, he signed the Faisal-Weizmann Agreement with Chaim Weizmann, President of the Zionist Organization, conditionally accepting the Balfour Declaration in hopes of Arab-Jewish cooperation.[^25]

However, the Arabs led by Faisal found that the victorious powers had made their own plans to divide the Middle East through the Sykes-Picot Agreement of 1916, which split the Arab region into zones of European influence.[^26] On March 8, 1920, Faisal was proclaimed King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria by the Syrian National Congress.[^27] This kingship proved tragically short-lived.

In July 1920, French forces set out from Lebanon to assert control over Damascus and topple Faisal's government.[^28] General Yusuf al-Azma, Faisal's war minister, led remnants of the Syrian army and local volunteers to confront the French at the Battle of Maysalun on July 24, 1920.[^29] The better-equipped French troops, led by General Mariano Goybet, decisively defeated al-Azma, who was killed in action.[^30] The French entered Damascus the following day, and Faisal was expelled from Syria.[^31] Despite the Syrian army's defeat, the battle became a symbol of courageous resistance against imperial power in Syria and the broader Arab world.[^32]

### Installation as King of Iraq (1921)

Following the violent suppression of the 1920 Iraqi Revolt against British occupation—which cost approximately 6,000 Iraqi lives and saw Winston Churchill controversially advocate using poison gas—the British sought a new approach to controlling their Mesopotamian mandate.[^33] At the Cairo Conference held from March 12 to 30, 1921, under Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill's auspices, the British decided that Faisal was an ideal candidate for ruling the British Mandate of Iraq based on advice from T.E. Lawrence and Gertrude Bell.[^34]

On June 12, 1921, Faisal left Jeddah for Iraq alongside several Iraqi nobles and Sir Kinahan Cornwallis on the RIMS Northbrook.[^35] On June 23, he first landed in Iraq at the main port of Basra, though the Shia majority were initially lukewarm and his appearance was met with indifference.[^36] Following a plebiscite showing 96% in favor—a result achieved with help from British officials including Gertrude Bell, who helped Faisal campaign among the Arabs of Iraq and win over popular support of the minority Sunni—Faisal agreed to become king.[^37] On August 23, 1921, at age 38, he was crowned King of Iraq, beginning what would be a short but formative period in modern Iraqi history.[^38]

## Major Achievements

### Negotiating Iraqi Independence

From his position of influence, Faisal negotiated with Britain a series of treaties culminating in 1930 with an agreement that enabled Iraq to achieve complete independence.[^39] The Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, signed in June 1930, was of twenty-five years' duration and came into force upon Iraq's admission to the League of Nations.[^40] It provided for the establishment of a "close alliance" between Britain and Iraq with "full and frank consultation between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests."[^41]

On October 3, 1932, the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq became an independent state, with the League of Nations voting unanimously to admit the Kingdom of Iraq to membership.[^42] Iraq became the first of the League of Nations mandates to achieve full independence as a sovereign state.[^43] Faisal presided over the independence of the Kingdom of Iraq upon the end of the British Mandate and the country's entry into the League of Nations, a crowning achievement of his reign.[^44]

### Modernization and Infrastructure Development

Faisal I is credited with modernizing Iraq's infrastructure, education system, and military during his reign.[^45] He laid the foundations for the modern Iraqi state through systematic development efforts.[^46] Railway building, which had begun under the British in the 1920s, continued during his reign, with lines north of Baghdad built to standard gauge, while those to the south used meter gauge.[^47] The complete Basra to Baghdad route had opened on January 16, 1920, and the line northwest from Jalula Junction was extended from Kingerban to Kirkuk in 1925.[^48]

Faisal was one of the first to advocate for building a government oil refinery, though it was not technically or financially feasible during his lifetime.[^49] More successfully, he developed desert motor routes from Baghdad to Damascus and Baghdad to Amman, which generated great interest in the Mosul oilfield and eventually led to his plan to build an oil pipeline to a Mediterranean port.[^50] In 1931, the Iraqi government and Iraq Petroleum Company reached an agreement for a new 70-year concession, in exchange for increased payments to Iraq and an agreement that two pipelines to the Mediterranean would be built by 1935.[^51] Under his rule, construction began on an oil pipeline between Kirkuk and Haifa, completed between 1932 and 1934.[^52]

Faisal's reign saw notable advancements in education, with the establishment of modern educational institutions that would shape Iraq's future generations.[^53] Finance minister Sassoon Eskell was instrumental in forming Iraq's financial system and oil industry during this period.[^54]

### Promoting Pan-Arabism and National Unity

During his reign, Faisal fostered unity between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims to encourage common loyalty and promote pan-Arabism with the goal of creating an Arab state that would include Iraq, Syria, and the rest of the Fertile Crescent.[^55] His focus on Arab nationalist discourse in Iraq was, in part, an effort to overcome the historical division between Sunnis and Shiites, encouraging constituents to embrace Arabism instead of sectarianism.[^56]

Faisal himself was a tolerant man, proclaiming himself a friend of the Shi'i Muslim, Kurdish, and Jewish communities in his realm.[^57] As a Pan-Arab leader with no specific political roots in Iraq, he derived his authority by moderating various conflicting elements, valuing British friendship while maintaining his full credentials among fervent Arab nationalists as their leader.[^58] His ability to meet with diverse groups previously unknown to him and win their recognition of Hussein as an Arab leader indicated the existence of a nascent Arab nationalism.[^59]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Perceived as a British Puppet

Despite his Islamic and pan-Arab credentials, Faisal was not an Iraqi, and no matter how effectively he ruled, Iraqis saw the monarchy as a British creation.[^60] In 1921, few people in Iraq even knew who Faisal was or had heard his name.[^61] British influence continued throughout his reign, whether formally through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 or informally through the many unspoken rules that governed British relations with much of the Iraqi elite.[^62] The British retained military bases in the country, with Iraq granting the British the use of air bases near Basra and at Al Habbaniyah and the right to move troops across the country.[^63]

### Viewed as a Traitor by Shia Religious Authorities

Influential Shia religious authorities, the mujtahid, viewed Faisal as a traitor for making a deal with the foreign occupier.[^64] Both in Syria and Iraq, Faisal was criticized for his naive approach to the Europeans, according to historian Luizard.[^65] Officials from the Foreign Office in Cairo had made him believe that he and his family were destined to spread pan-Arab nationalism, but he found himself at the centre of events he didn't control.[^66]

### Political Double-Dealing

In public speeches, Faisal criticized the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty for stopping short of removing the mandate, even though he privately supported it, which led Gertrude Bell to become livid at his double-dealing.[^67] When independence was finally secured on June 30, 1930, he faced yet another round of criticism because it would only take effect in 1932 and the country would remain tied to Great Britain through defence provisions.[^68]

### Complicity in Dismembering the Ottoman Empire

Despite his Arab nationalist credentials, Faisal remains a controversial figure, accused, along with his Hashemite family, of complicity in dismembering the modern Islamic state—the Ottoman Empire—and working with the colonial powers.[^69] Twenty thousand soldiers had lost their lives in a rebellion for a promise of freedom that was undermined by the Sykes-Picot agreement, leading to lasting resentment.[^70]

### Failure to Create Iraqi National Identity

In a memorandum dated March 1933 (though some scholars incorrectly date it to March 1932), Faisal expressed profound pessimism about Iraqi national identity.[^71] He wrote that Iraq was "a kingdom ruled by a Sunni Arab government founded on the wreckage of Ottoman rule" and criticized the Iraqi people's lack of Iraqi national identity.[^72]

The memorandum revealed his deep concerns: "The government rules over a Kurdish segment, the majority of which is ignorant, that includes persons with personal ambitions who lead it to abandon the government under the pretext that it does not belong to their ethnicity."[^73] Regarding sectarian divisions, he wrote: "The government also rules over an ignorant Shiite majority that belongs to the same ethnicity of the government, but the persecutions that had befallen them as a result of Turkish rule, which did not enable them to take part in governance, drove a deep wedge between the Arab people divided into these two sects."[^74]

Faisal expressed that "his heart was full of sadness and pain because there was no Iraqi nation in Iraq as yet, but rather human masses devoid of any patriotic notion, full of traditions and religious nonsense."[^75] This pessimistic assessment revealed the fundamental challenge of his reign: building a unified nation-state from diverse sectarian and ethnic communities.

### The Simele Massacre (1933)

The most serious controversy of Faisal's reign occurred in his final months. In August 1933, the Kingdom of Iraq under Kurdish army general Bakr Sidqi committed the Simele massacre against the Assyrian population in and around the village of Simele.[^76] Although primarily known for attacks in Simele village, 54 villages in total were targeted during a four-day period.[^77] Official British sources estimated around 600 Assyrian deaths, while Assyrian sources put the figure at 3,000.[^78]

King Faisal, who had recently returned to Iraq from a medical vacation, was under great physical stress during the crisis, and his health deteriorated during the hot Baghdad summer.[^79] On August 15, the British chargé d'affaires described meeting him in his pajamas as he sat in his bed, denying that a massacre had been committed in Simele.[^80] Although the massacre was initially officially denied by the Iraqi government, there is no doubt among historians about the atrocities that occurred, but the extent to which the Iraqi government is to blame remains debated.[^81] Historians disagree on whether the Iraqi government intended to commit a massacre on Assyrian civilians or whether the army only intended to punish insurgents and the massacre was a more or less spontaneous act.[^82]

## Personal Life

Faisal was married to two women during his lifetime. His first wife was Sharifa Huzaima bint Nasser, with whom he had one son and three daughters.[^83] His second wife was Sharifa Latifa bint Hamed, with whom he had one son.[^84]

His children included Ghazi, born in 1912, who would succeed him as King of Iraq and marry his first cousin, Princess Aliya bint Ali, daughter of King Ali of Hejaz.[^85] Faisal also had three daughters: Princess Azza bint Faisal, Princess Rajiha bint Faisal, and Princess Rafia bint Faisal.[^86] From his second wife, he had Prince Mohammad.[^87]

As a ruler, Faisal demonstrated a personality marked by tolerance and diplomatic skill. He was described as someone who could meet with diverse groups previously unknown to him and win their loyalty.[^88] His ability to navigate between competing interests—British imperial demands, Arab nationalist expectations, tribal leaders, and religious authorities—required considerable political acumen.[^89]

Faisal maintained close relationships with his British advisors, particularly Gertrude Bell, who had supported him since 1919 and became a close advisor after making Baghdad her home.[^90] With T.E. Lawrence, he had developed a relationship during the Arab Revolt that Lawrence romanticized in his writings, though historians have questioned the accuracy of some of Lawrence's portrayals.[^91]

Faisal's health was a recurring concern throughout his reign. He had spent several weeks in 1930 and 1931 undergoing medical treatment at a private clinic in Bern, Switzerland.[^92] In July 1933, he returned to Switzerland for medical treatment, and after briefly returning to Iraq to deal with the Assyrian crisis, he went back to Bern in late August to continue his treatment.[^93]

On September 8, 1933, King Faisal I died of a heart attack at the Bellevue Palace hotel in Bern, Switzerland, at the age of 48.[^94] His eldest son Ghazi, who was 21 at the time, had been proclaimed the new King of Iraq seven days before his father's burial.[^95]

## Legacy

### Impact on Modern Iraq

Faisal I's legacy is marked by his efforts to balance traditional tribal leadership with modern state governance, laying the groundwork for Iraq's political future.[^96] He successfully guided Iraq to become the first League of Nations mandate to achieve full independence, establishing a precedent for other mandated territories.[^97] The foundations he laid for the modern Iraqi state—including its military, education system, and infrastructure—would endure beyond his reign.[^98]

However, his inability to forge a genuine Iraqi national identity would have lasting consequences. His 1933 memorandum's assessment that there was "no Iraqi nation in Iraq as yet, but rather human masses devoid of any patriotic notion" proved prophetic.[^99] The sectarian and ethnic divisions he identified—between Sunni and Shia Arabs, between Arabs and Kurds, and between Muslims and other religious communities—would continue to plague Iraq throughout the 20th century and into the 21st.

### The Hashemite Monarchy's Fate

Faisal's dynasty proved short-lived. His son Ghazi died in 1939 at almost 30 years of age following a car accident and was succeeded by his four-year-old son Faisal II.[^100] The Hashemite monarchy in Iraq ended violently in the 1958 revolution, when Faisal II, members of his family, and palace staff were assassinated.[^101] The Cairo Conference of 1921 had set parameters for Iraqi political life that continued until this 1958 revolution.[^102]

### Posthumous Reputation

Faisal was never fully accepted in Iraq during his short tenure and was vilified after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1958.[^103] Despite being criticized both for cooperation with colonial powers and for his pan-Arab policies that drew wedges between Arab and Kurdish communities, his complex legacy has undergone reassessment.[^104]

His policy of promoting pan-Arab nationalism to further his personal and dynastic ambitions proved to be a disruptive force in Iraq, yet his efforts toward sectarian unity and his tolerance toward diverse communities represented ideals that Iraq would continue to struggle toward.[^105] Understanding that the base of his power was from Iraq's Sunni Arabs, who were a minority, Faisal recognized that if Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine were merged into his kingdom, Sunni Arabs would make up the majority of his subjects—a calculation that revealed both the artificial nature of Iraq's borders and the political pragmatism underlying his pan-Arab rhetoric.[^106]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historian Ali A. Allawi's comprehensive 2014 biography portrays Faisal as "a deeply admired leader who, undaunted by repeated setbacks, strove to build an independent, unified Arab state on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire."[^107] Allawi shows Faisal's evolution from careful, conservative Ottoman loyalist to a fiery revolutionary and finally to an idealistic statesman.[^108] Christopher de Bellaigue in the Financial Times praised Allawi's work as "a sympathetic but by no means uncritical portrait, drawing on all the available sources, in English and Arabic," predicting "It is unlikely to be dislodged as the standard treatment for some time to come."[^109]

More positive assessments of his reign have stressed the material progress achieved as he exercised control over a country stormy enough to overturn the governments of some of his successors.[^110] What some historians characterized as vacuous and unprincipled opportunism has been reinterpreted by others as that quality of balanced realism essential for successful statesmanship.[^111] In 1933, John S. Bodeau wrote that King Faisal was "a ruler who stood above religious, political and racial parties, whose influence was ever for tolerance and progress."[^112]

Faisal is recognized as an influential figure in shaping modern Iraq and the broader Arab world, with his diplomatic skills and efforts at modernization earning scholarly respect.[^113] His reign saw Iraq achieve independence and international recognition, establishing institutions that would serve as the foundation for the modern state.[^114] His ability to navigate between British imperial demands and Arab nationalist aspirations, while imperfect, demonstrated considerable political skill given the impossible position in which he found himself.[^115]

### Negative Views

Faisal's detractors have held that in Iraq his manner of rule manifested vacillation, temporization, and self-promotion, with his willingness to compromise sometimes taken as a lack of resolve.[^116] Critics argue that he was too willing to accommodate British imperial interests, serving essentially as a puppet king who provided a veneer of Arab legitimacy to British control.[^117]

The criticism for his naive approach to Europeans in both Syria and Iraq suggests a leader who was repeatedly outmaneuvered by more cynical colonial powers.[^118] His public criticism of treaties he privately supported revealed political duplicity that undermined trust.[^119] His pan-Arab nationalism, while idealistic, has been characterized as serving primarily his personal and dynastic ambitions rather than genuine Iraqi interests.[^120]

Most seriously, his failure to create an Iraqi national identity and his own deeply pessimistic 1933 assessment of Iraqi society as "human masses devoid of any patriotic notion" suggests a fundamental failure at the core of his state-building project.[^121] Some historians argue that the artificial nature of Iraq as a British creation made genuine nation-building impossible, and Faisal's reign simply postponed inevitable conflicts rather than resolving them.[^122]

The controversy over his role in the Simele massacre—whether through active denial, passive negligence, or inability to control his own military—casts a shadow over his final months and legacy of tolerance.[^123] That he was vilified after the 1958 revolution indicates that many Iraqis ultimately viewed him as having collaborated with colonial occupation rather than as a nationalist hero.[^124]
