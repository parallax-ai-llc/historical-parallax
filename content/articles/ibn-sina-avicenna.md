## Summary

Ibn Sina, known in the West as Avicenna, was a Persian polymath born around 980 CE near Bukhara and died in 1037 CE in Hamadan. He is considered the most significant philosopher in the Islamic tradition and arguably the most influential philosopher of the pre-modern era. His magnum opus, *The Canon of Medicine*, became a standard medical textbook in both Islamic and European universities for over six centuries. As a seminal figure of the Islamic Golden Age, he contributed extensively to philosophy, medicine, astronomy, mathematics, psychology, and numerous other fields, leaving behind some 240 extant works that shaped both Eastern and Western intellectual traditions.

## Early Life and Background

Ibn Sina was born around 980 CE in the village of Afshana near Bukhara in Transoxiana, present-day Uzbekistan, to a Persian family.[^1] His father, Abdullah, hailed from the city of Balkh and served as a local governor for a village near Bukhara under the Samanid dynasty.[^2] His mother, Sitara, was a Tadjik woman from Bukhara.[^3] The family's home became a meeting place for scholars, providing an intellectually rich environment that would prove crucial to the young prodigy's development.[^4]

An unusually gifted child with an exceptional memory, Ibn Sina was first schooled in the Quran and literature.[^5] By the remarkable age of ten, he had memorized the entire Quran, demonstrating cognitive abilities that would define his entire career.[^6] His father sent him to study arithmetic under an Indian greengrocer, and he was later schooled in Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) with the Hanafi jurist Ismail al-Zahid.[^7] His father invited the physician and philosopher al-Natili to their house to educate Ibn Sina in more advanced subjects.[^8]

The young scholar's intellectual development proceeded at an astonishing pace. By age sixteen, Ibn Sina turned to medicine, a discipline over which he claimed "easy" mastery.[^9] At seventeen, he was called to the bedside of the Sultan of Bukhara, Nuh ibn Mansur, who had fallen ill with an ailment that baffled the court physicians.[^10] When Ibn Sina successfully cured the sultan, he was rewarded with access to the royal Samanid library, a treasure trove of knowledge that accelerated his education.[^11] By eighteen, he was well-educated in Greek sciences and claimed to have mastered all the sciences.[^12] He entered into the service of the Samanid court as a physician, beginning his prodigious writing career at age twenty-one.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Ibn Sina's rise to prominence occurred during a tumultuous period in Persian history, as various dynasties competed for control of the region. Following the death of his father when he was at least twenty-one years old, Ibn Sina found himself navigating the complex political landscape of medieval Persia.[^14] After the Samanid dynasty's defeat in 997 CE, he moved to Gurganj, the capital of Khwarazm, serving the Ma'munid ruler Abu al-Hasan Ali.[^15]

His expertise as both physician and philosopher made him invaluable to the courts of Iranian rulers. He moved to Jerjan near the Caspian Sea, where he lectured on astronomy and logic and began writing the first part of his monumental work, *Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb* (*The Canon of Medicine*).[^16] His career then took him to Al-Rayy, near modern Tehran, where he established a medical practice and authored approximately thirty books.[^17]

In Hamadan, Ibn Sina's political fortunes reached their zenith when he cured Prince Emir Shams al-Dawlah of the Buyid dynasty from severe colic.[^18] At the age of thirty-two, he was appointed vizier (chief minister) of the Buyid state, combining his roles as court physician and political counselor.[^19] This position exposed him to the intrigues and dangers of court politics, including periods when he was forced to hide from persecution.[^20]

However, his political career was not without setbacks. When Shams al-Dawlah died, Ibn Sina wrote to the ruler of Isfahan seeking a position at his court.[^21] When the Emir of Hamadan discovered this correspondence, he had Ibn Sina arrested and imprisoned in the fortress of Fardajan outside Hamadan.[^22] Ibn Sina spent four months in prison, during which time he continued to write several books, demonstrating his characteristic intellectual productivity even in adversity.[^23] After his release, when Ala al-Dawla captured Hamadan, Ibn Sina joined his court and arrived in Isfahan in 1025, disguised as a Sufi ascetic along with his brother, a student, and two slaves.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### The Canon of Medicine

Ibn Sina's most celebrated achievement was *The Canon of Medicine* (*Al-Qanun fi al-Tibb*), an encyclopedia of medicine completed around 1025 CE.[^25] This masterpiece of Arabic systematization sought to collate and organize all known medical knowledge into a coherent framework.[^26] The Canon is organized into five books: Book 1 covers basic principles of medicine; Book 2 lists approximately 800 individual drugs of vegetable and mineral origin; Book 3 discusses diseases of individual organs; Book 4 addresses medical conditions affecting the entire body, such as fevers and poisons; and Book 5 lists some 650 medicinal compounds along with their uses and effects.[^27]

The Canon's influence on medicine was profound and enduring. From the twelfth to the seventeenth centuries, it served as the chief guide to medical science in the West.[^28] Between 1500 and 1674, over sixty editions and numerous commentaries were produced.[^29] The work was used as a standard medical textbook through the eighteenth century in Europe and remained in use as late as 1650 at many medieval European universities.[^30] The information presented in Book 3 represents some of Ibn Sina's most important contributions to several fields of study, including atherosclerosis, pulsology, migraines, cataracts, vasovagal syncope, and neuroscience.[^31]

Ibn Sina introduced to mankind some of the most important medical discoveries, including the concept that infectious diseases are transmitted through water and air containing very small animals invisible to the naked eye.[^32] He was the first physician to describe meningitis, strokes, and paralysis caused by internal bodily causes.[^33] Ibn Sina is credited as the first physician to introduce psychotherapy to the world of medicine, coining the term "psychosomatic illness" and emphasizing the connection between mind and body.[^34] His description of fractures, their causes, types, and complications, along with his recommendation to wait five days before splinting a fractured limb, is a procedure now universally adopted.[^35]

### The Book of Healing

Ibn Sina's philosophical masterwork, *Kitāb al-Shifāʾ* (*The Book of Healing*), was most likely begun in 1014, completed around 1020, and published in 1027.[^36] Despite its title, this work is not about medicine but rather a scientific and philosophical encyclopedia intended to "cure" or "heal" ignorance of the soul.[^37] The book is divided into four parts: logic, natural sciences, mathematics (the quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music), and metaphysics.[^38]

The Book of Healing represents a synthesis of Greek, Persian, and Islamic knowledge, bringing Aristotelian and Platonic philosophical traditions together with Islamic theology.[^39] One of Ibn Sina's most significant contributions within this work was his development of scientific methodology. He criticized Aristotelian induction, arguing that "it does not lead to the absolute, universal, and certain premises that it purports to provide," and developed instead a "method of experimentation as a means for scientific inquiry."[^40]

The work's influence extended across centuries and civilizations. Thanks to the Toledo Latin translation of the metaphysics section (*Ilāhiyyāt*), every Latin medieval philosopher from the late twelfth century onwards encountered Ibn Sina's interpretations.[^41] The Book of Healing had a decisive impact upon European scholasticism, particularly influencing Thomas Aquinas and the works of Maimonides.[^42] In the East, particularly in the Persian area, Ibn Sina's metaphysics not only profoundly influenced philosophy and theology but also founded a centuries-old tradition still considered extant today.[^43]

### Contributions to Astronomy and Mathematics

Ibn Sina considered mathematical astronomy a separate discipline from astrology, demonstrating a rigorous scientific approach.[^44] He criticized Aristotle's view that stars receive their light from the Sun, instead asserting that stars are self-luminous, and he believed that planets are also self-luminous.[^45] He claimed to have observed the transit of Venus across the Sun, seeing it as a mark on the Sun's face, which helped him establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in position.[^46] He invented an instrument for observing the coordinates of stars with an improved sighting system that theoretically could provide considerably improved accuracy.[^47]

In mathematics, he presented new ideas in geometry and numerology as part of his encyclopedic works.[^48] His major work *The Book of Healing* included an encyclopedic exposition of logic, physics, mathematics, and metaphysics, demonstrating the interconnectedness of all knowledge.[^49]

### Psychology and Philosophy of Mind

Ibn Sina made groundbreaking contributions to psychology and the understanding of consciousness. In *The Canon of Medicine*, he discussed the structure of the psychological apparatus of human beings and the connection of psychological functions with the brain.[^50] He was considering that the causes of mental illnesses originate in the head well before the emergence of phrenology, directing thought towards modern psychology.[^51]

His famous "Floating Man" thought experiment remains one of philosophy's most influential arguments about consciousness and self-awareness.[^52] The experiment requires us to imagine a man who comes into existence fully developed but has no sensory experience of the world or his own body.[^53] Avicenna posits the instantaneous creation of a fully formed adult human suspended in a void, with all senses rendered inactive so that no perception of the external world, the body, or internal organs occurs.[^54] Despite this complete sensory deprivation, the individual would immediately affirm the existence of their own self or soul, without awareness of bodily attributes.[^55] Ibn Sina concluded that the soul is immaterial and substantial, and claimed that no human could deny their own consciousness or awareness.[^56] This thought experiment predates Descartes' famous "cogito ergo sum" by over six centuries.[^57]

Ibn Sina believed in the importance of the connection between mind and body, suggesting humans have the ability to overcome physical illnesses through convincing themselves that they can recover.[^58] He developed rudimentary fear, shock, and musical therapies to cure mental ailments, and his theories eliminated retrograde beliefs that mental illnesses were caused by demons and evil spirits.[^59]

### Scientific Methodology and Natural Philosophy

Ibn Sina's approach to science emphasized observation and experimentation. His encouragement of observation is one of the basic tenets of the scientific process, his description of the anatomy and some of the muscles of the eye are still used, and his advocacy of trial and control in drug testing forms the basis of modern pharmacological discovery.[^60]

Around 1000 CE, Ibn Sina suggested a hypothesis about the origin of mountain ranges that would still have been considered quite radical in the Christian world eight hundred years later.[^61] He modified Aristotle's theory about fossils into the theory of petrifying fluids (*succus lapidificatus*), which was elaborated on by Albertus Magnus in the thirteenth century and accepted by most naturalists by the sixteenth century.[^62] His theory on the formation of metals combined the alchemical sulfur-mercury theory with the mineralogical theories of Aristotle and Theophrastus, creating a synthesis concerning the nature of mineral and metallic states.[^63]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Al-Ghazali's Accusations of Heresy

The most serious and consequential criticisms of Ibn Sina came from the influential Islamic theologian and philosopher Abu Hamid al-Ghazali (1058-1111). Al-Ghazali's engagement with Ibn Sina's philosophy led him to argue that elements of Ibn Sina's thought were heretical, an exceedingly serious claim as the punishment for heresy in his view and many others of the time should be death.[^64] In his work *Deliverance from Error*, al-Ghazali noted that the Greek philosophers "must be taxed with unbelief, as must their partisans among the Muslim philosophers, such as Ibn Sina and al-Farabi and their likes."[^65]

Al-Ghazali focused particularly on three arguments: Ibn Sina's views on the eternity of the world, his conception of God's knowledge, and his position on bodily resurrection.[^66] Al-Ghazali stated that Ibn Sina's philosophy "can be reduced to three parts: a part which must be branded as unbelief; a part which must be stigmatized as innovation; and a part which need not be repudiated at all."[^67] Ibn Sina's views of God's knowledge of particulars generated much controversy in medieval Islamic and Christian philosophical and theological circles and provoked strong rejection by al-Ghazali.[^68]

### Criticisms from Other Islamic Scholars

Beyond al-Ghazali, Ibn Sina's theology on metaphysical issues was criticized by other Islamic scholars, including Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim.[^69] The theologian Fakhr al-Din al-Razi also mounted attacks on Ibn Sina's philosophical system.[^70] These criticisms centered on whether Ibn Sina had strayed too far from orthodox Islamic theology in his embrace of Greek philosophical traditions, particularly Aristotelian and Neoplatonic thought.

### Philosophical Criticisms

Ibn Rushd (Averroes), the famous Andalusian philosopher, accused Ibn Sina of having violated the definition of substance as that which exists by itself.[^71] Thomas Aquinas, although he adopted the distinction between essence and existence under Ibn Sina's direct influence, nevertheless followed Ibn Rushd in this criticism.[^72] These philosophical debates reveal the complexity of Ibn Sina's thought and the ways it challenged established categories and definitions.

### The Mysticism Debate

Among the fierce controversies surrounding Ibn Sina's thought was the discussion of whether he should be considered a mystic.[^73] Some scholars have interpreted certain passages in his later works, particularly those discussing the soul's ascent to union with the divine, as evidence of mystical inclinations. Others argue that Ibn Sina remained fundamentally a rationalist philosopher whose apparent mysticism was merely metaphorical or pedagogical.

### Personal Conduct

Some sources contain partial statements suggesting that Ibn Sina was considered an arrogant thinker by some of his contemporaries.[^74] When he failed to understand a problem or solve a syllogism, he would resort to prayer in the mosque and, according to some accounts, drinking wine for inspiration—a practice that would have been controversial given Islamic prohibitions on alcohol.[^75]

Despite these attacks and controversies, Ibn Sina built an elaborate and complete system of philosophy that remained dominant in the philosophical tradition of Islam for centuries.[^76] His ability to synthesize diverse intellectual traditions while maintaining a coherent systematic philosophy ensured his lasting influence, even among those who criticized specific elements of his thought.

---

## Personal Life

Ibn Sina's personal life was marked by constant movement, intellectual productivity, and political intrigue. Throughout his life, he moved from city to city, sometimes seeking employment, often fleeing persecution.[^77] His talents as physician and administrator were in great demand, leading to his appointment as vizier twice, which exposed him to court intrigue and danger.[^78] He was forced to hide for extended periods and was imprisoned at least once in the fortress of Fardajan for four months after the Emir of Hamadan discovered his correspondence with a rival ruler.[^79]

Despite these turbulent circumstances, Ibn Sina never ceased his scholarly activities. Even while imprisoned, he continued to write several books, demonstrating extraordinary intellectual discipline and commitment.[^80] He traveled with a small retinue that included his brother, at least one student, and two slaves, indicating both his social status and his dedication to teaching.[^81]

Ibn Sina's personality combined exceptional intellectual gifts with a driven, ambitious character. An unusually gifted child with an exceptional memory, he listened in to scholarly discussions from an early age and absorbed knowledge voraciously.[^82] By age ten, he had memorized the entire Quran, and by eighteen claimed to have mastered all the sciences—claims that his subsequent achievements suggest were not mere boasts.[^83]

His relationship with wine and its role in his thinking process has been a subject of historical interest and controversy. Some accounts suggest he would resort to drinking wine when struggling with difficult intellectual problems, seeking inspiration—a practice at odds with Islamic religious law but perhaps reflective of the complex relationship between religious observance and philosophical inquiry in his era.[^84]

The circumstances of Ibn Sina's death reveal the physical toll of his demanding life. He had suffered from colic throughout his life, and a severe attack seized him while he was accompanying Ala al-Dawla's army on a military campaign against Hamadan.[^85] Finding the disease gaining ground and reaching Hamadan with difficulty, he refused to maintain the prescribed medical regimen and resigned himself to his fate.[^86] He died in 1037 at the age of fifty-seven, and was buried in Hamadan, where his mausoleum still stands today.[^87]

Ibn Sina wrote an autobiography that has been supplemented with material from a biography written by one of his students, providing valuable insight into his self-perception and the way he was viewed by those who knew him personally.[^88] These biographical sources paint a picture of a man of enormous intellectual ambition, tireless productivity, and deep commitment to the life of the mind, even amidst the political turbulence and personal hardships that characterized his era.

## Legacy

### Medical Legacy

Ibn Sina's medical legacy is perhaps his most enduring contribution to human knowledge. Often described as the father of early modern medicine, his *Canon of Medicine* continued to be taught as a medical textbook in Europe and in the Islamic world until the early modern period.[^89] The Canon's influence extended far beyond mere theoretical knowledge; it shaped practical medical education and clinical practice for over six centuries.[^90]

In contemporary medicine, from perinatal care to cardiology, Ibn Sina's ideas continue to echo.[^91] His holistic approach to medicine, integrating physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of health, anticipated modern biopsychosocial models of disease.[^92] His emphasis on the connection between mind and body, his introduction of psychotherapy, and his recognition of psychosomatic illness established foundations that influenced both Eastern and Western medicine.[^93]

### Philosophical Legacy

Ibn Sina is probably the most significant philosopher in the Islamic tradition and arguably the most influential philosopher of the pre-modern era.[^94] As the preeminent philosopher and physician of the Muslim world, he combined disparate strands of philosophical and scientific thinking into a rationally rigorous and self-consistent scientific system that encompassed all reality.[^95] His comprehensive articulation of science and philosophy represents the culmination of the Hellenic tradition, and it dominated intellectual life in the Islamic world for centuries, determining developments in philosophy, science, religion, theology, and mysticism.[^96]

In the West, many of his works found their way into Latin translations, serving as foundational pillars for Western scholars.[^97] His influence on medieval philosophy, logic, medicine, astronomy, geology, and zoology was profound, with thinkers like Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus citing his insights directly.[^98] His philosophical summa *The Book of Healing* had a decisive impact upon European scholasticism and especially upon Thomas Aquinas.[^99] Avicenna's philosophical works strongly impacted Thomism and the works of Maimonides, among others.[^100]

The widespread hegemony of Avicennan philosophy in Islamic thought from the twelfth century demonstrates his enduring impact.[^101] In the East, particularly in the Persian area, Ibn Sina's metaphysics not only profoundly influenced philosophy and theology but also founded a centuries-old tradition considered still extant.[^102]

### Scientific Legacy

Ibn Sina was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in Islam, particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic, and medicine.[^103] He is credited with preserving and building upon the ideas of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, whose ideas form the bedrock of the modern scientific method.[^104] His development of experimental methodology and his critique of pure induction represented important steps toward the modern scientific approach.[^105]

His geological theories about mountain formation and fossilization influenced European natural philosophy for centuries.[^106] His astronomical observations and instrumentation contributed to the advancement of observational astronomy.[^107] His psychological insights laid groundwork for the modern understanding of consciousness and mental illness.[^108]

### Contemporary Recognition

UNESCO established the Avicenna Prize for Ethics in Science in 2002, awarded biennially to this day, as a testament to his enduring ethical and scientific significance.[^109] His legacy continues to inspire educational initiatives, including scholarships named in his honor at institutions worldwide, recognizing his role as a bridge between civilizations and a symbol of scientific excellence.[^110]

In Iran, Uzbekistan, and throughout the Islamic world, Ibn Sina is celebrated as a cultural hero and symbol of the Islamic Golden Age's intellectual achievements.[^111] His mausoleum in Hamadan, Iran, has become a pilgrimage site for those who admire his contributions to human knowledge.[^112] In the West, renewed interest in Islamic philosophy and the history of science has brought fresh attention to his works and their place in the development of global intellectual traditions.[^113]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars overwhelmingly recognize Ibn Sina as "probably the most significant philosopher in the Islamic tradition and arguably the most influential philosopher of the pre-modern era."[^114] His ability to synthesize diverse intellectual traditions while maintaining philosophical rigor earned him admiration across centuries and civilizations. As one assessment notes, he "combined disparate strands of philosophical and scientific thinking into a rationally rigorous and self-consistent scientific system that encompassed all reality."[^115]

Medieval European scholars held Ibn Sina in the highest regard. The extensive translation of his works into Latin and their incorporation into university curricula demonstrate the respect accorded to his thought.[^116] Thomas Aquinas, despite some disagreements, drew heavily on Ibn Sina's distinction between essence and existence, a concept that became central to scholastic philosophy.[^117] The fact that the Canon of Medicine remained in use as a standard textbook for over six centuries speaks to its systematic excellence and practical utility.[^118]

Contemporary scholars emphasize his role as a bridge between civilizations. One recent assessment describes him as a "bridge between civilisations and a beacon for Western scholars," highlighting how his work facilitated the transmission of Greek philosophy and science to both the Islamic world and medieval Europe.[^119] His comprehensive approach to knowledge, integrating medicine, philosophy, natural science, and theology, exemplifies the ideal of the universal scholar that characterized the Islamic Golden Age.[^120]

His contributions to specific fields continue to receive scholarly praise. In psychology, he is recognized for contributions that "eliminated the retrograded beliefs of mental illnesses caused by demons and evil spirits" and for developing treatments based on understanding the mind-body connection.[^121] In medicine, his systematic approach and emphasis on observation and experimentation are seen as anticipating modern scientific medicine.[^122] His philosophical sophistication, particularly in metaphysics and epistemology, continues to attract serious scholarly attention and reinterpretation.[^123]

### Negative Views

Despite his enormous influence, Ibn Sina has faced persistent criticism, particularly from within the Islamic tradition. Al-Ghazali's eleventh-century attacks on Ibn Sina's philosophy as heretical represented not merely academic disagreement but a fundamental challenge to the compatibility of Greek philosophy with Islamic theology.[^124] Al-Ghazali's charge that Ibn Sina and other Muslim philosophers "must be taxed with unbelief" had lasting consequences, contributing to the decline of rationalist philosophy in some parts of the Islamic world.[^125]

Later Islamic scholars, including Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Qayyim, continued this critique, arguing that Ibn Sina had strayed too far from orthodox Islamic thought in his embrace of Greek philosophical categories and concepts.[^126] These critics viewed his rationalism as potentially undermining faith and his metaphysical speculations as innovations without proper Quranic or Prophetic foundation.[^127]

Philosophical critics, both medieval and modern, have identified specific weaknesses in Ibn Sina's arguments. Ibn Rushd accused him of violating the definition of substance, and later philosophers have questioned various aspects of his logic and metaphysics.[^128] Some scholars argue that his attempts to synthesize Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, and Islamic thought resulted in inconsistencies and contradictions that he never fully resolved.[^129]

Modern historians of science have noted that while Ibn Sina made important contributions to medical knowledge, some of his theories were incorrect or limited by the constraints of his time.[^130] His prohibition from performing dissections due to religious restrictions limited his anatomical knowledge, and some of his physiological theories have not stood the test of time.[^131]

Some critics have pointed to aspects of Ibn Sina's personal conduct, particularly the reports of his arrogance and wine drinking, as inconsistent with the image of a pious Muslim scholar.[^132] While these criticisms may reflect the personal prejudices of his detractors, they contributed to ongoing debates about his character and the relationship between his philosophical commitments and his religious observance.[^133]

The debate over whether Ibn Sina should be considered a mystic or a rationalist has never been fully resolved, with some scholars viewing the ambiguity in his writings as evidence of either confusion or deliberate evasiveness on fundamental questions about the soul's relationship to God.[^134] Critics from both mystical and rationalist camps have found aspects of his synthesis unsatisfying, arguing that he failed to fully commit to either approach.[^135]
