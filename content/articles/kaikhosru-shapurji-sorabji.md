## Summary

Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji was a British-Indian composer of Parsi (Zoroastrian) and Spanish-Sicilian descent whose monumental piano works are among the longest and most complex ever written. While primarily a musician, his work was deeply influenced by mysticism, theosophy, and Zoroastrian spirituality. His compositions, some lasting over six hours, were conceived as spiritual meditations. He withdrew his music from public performance for decades.
