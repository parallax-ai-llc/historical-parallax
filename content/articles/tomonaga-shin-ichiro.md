## Summary

Tomonaga Shin'ichiro was a Japanese physicist who independently developed the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), for which he shared the 1965 Nobel Prize in Physics with Richard Feynman and Julian Schwinger. His renormalization approach resolved the infinity problems in quantum field theory and established Japan as a center for theoretical physics.
