## Summary

Philip IV of Spain (1605-1665), known as the "Planet King" (Rey Planeta), reigned as King of Spain from 1621 to 1665 and King of Portugal from 1621 to 1640.[^1] Ascending to the throne at age sixteen following his father Philip III's death, he presided over Spain during a turbulent period marked by the Thirty Years' War, territorial losses, and economic decline.[^2] Despite political adversity, Philip is celebrated for his extraordinary patronage of the arts, particularly his support of Diego Velázquez and the assembly of one of history's most magnificent art collections.[^3] His 44-year reign witnessed Spain's transformation from a dominant European power to a second-class state, a decline to which he contributed through unsuccessful military and domestic reforms.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Philip IV was born on April 8, 1605, in Valladolid, Spain, the eldest surviving son of King Philip III and Margaret of Austria.[^5] His full name was Felipe Domingo Víctor de la Cruz de Austria y Austria, reflecting the Habsburg dynasty's complex genealogy.[^6] Though he was actually the third son of Philip III, his older brothers had died before him, making him heir to the throne.[^7] He was formally sworn as heir to the Crown on January 30, 1608, in the Church of San Jerónimo El Real in Madrid, a ceremony that marked his official status as Prince of Asturias.[^8]

Philip's education was entrusted to Galcerán Albanell, a Catalan nobleman renowned for his erudition and learning.[^9] This education prepared him for the complex responsibilities of ruling the vast Spanish Empire, which at that time included territories across Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. From an early age, Philip was groomed in the political, religious, and cultural traditions of the Habsburg dynasty, learning the importance of maintaining Catholic orthodoxy and Spanish imperial prestige.[^10]

At the tender age of ten, Philip was married to Elisabeth of France (Isabel of Bourbon) on October 18, 1615, when she was thirteen years old.[^11] This marriage was a political alliance designed to strengthen ties between the Spanish and French royal houses. The young couple met for the first time on Pheasant Island on November 25, 1615, following their proxy marriage.[^12] Despite their youth, the marriage would prove politically significant, though personally complex, lasting until Elisabeth's death in 1644.[^13]

Philip's personality was shaped by the rigid court protocols and the weighty expectations placed upon him as heir to one of the world's most powerful empires. Unlike his father, who was known for his passivity and reliance on favorites, Philip showed more intelligence and engagement with affairs of state.[^14] However, like his father, he would come to depend heavily on powerful ministers to manage the day-to-day governance of his vast domains.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Philip IV ascended to the Spanish throne on March 31, 1621, following the death of his father Philip III, becoming king at the age of sixteen.[^16] His accession occurred at a critical juncture in European history, as the Thirty Years' War was already underway and Spain's global commitments were straining the empire's resources.[^17] When Philip became king in 1621, he inherited not only the throne of Spain but also the crowns of Aragon, Castile, and Portugal, along with diverse territories across Europe and a vast American empire.[^18]

From the very beginning of his reign, Philip demonstrated his trust in Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, by ordering that all papers requiring the royal signature should first be sent to the count-duke.[^19] Olivares had been introduced to Prince Philip when the prince was ten years old by Baltasar de Zúñiga, Olivares's uncle.[^20] Initially, Philip did not particularly take to Olivares, but over the course of at least a year, the relationship became close, with Philip's tendency towards underconfidence and diffidence counteracted by Olivares' drive and determination.[^21]

The young king's early reign was heavily influenced by Olivares and Zúñiga, who convinced Philip that he should commit Spain to a more aggressive foreign policy in alliance with the Holy Roman Empire.[^22] This decision would have profound consequences for Spain's future. One of the first major policy decisions was to renew hostilities with the Dutch in 1621, ending the Twelve Years' Truce that had been in effect since 1609.[^23] The goal was to bring the rebellious Dutch provinces to the negotiating table with the aim of achieving a peace treaty favorable to Spanish global interests.[^24]

Early in his reign, Philip would be woken by Olivares in the morning to discuss the day's affairs and would meet with him twice more during the day, although later this routine declined until the King would hold only one short meeting on policy with Olivares each day.[^25] By the time Philip was crowned king, Olivares, a man of unpleasing appearance and changing moods, had become the young king's irreplaceable companion.[^26] Olivares became what is known in Spain as a valido, something more than a prime minister—the favorite and alter ego of the king.[^27]

The pair had multiple rows and arguments over the course of their relationship, both as a result of their different personalities and differences of opinion over policies.[^28] Despite these tensions, Philip retained Olivares as his confidant and chief minister for the next twenty years, from 1621 to 1643.[^29] This partnership would define the first half of Philip's reign and shape Spain's destiny during one of the most challenging periods in its history.[^30]

## Major Achievements

### Military Victories

During the early years of Philip IV's reign, Spanish armies achieved several conspicuous victories that initially appeared to validate the aggressive foreign policy championed by Olivares.[^31] The most celebrated of these was the capture of Breda from the Dutch in 1626, following a lengthy siege that lasted from 1624 to 1625 during the Eighty Years' War.[^32] This victory was immortalized in Diego Velázquez's masterpiece "The Surrender of Breda" (also known as "Las Lanzas"), which depicted the moment when the Dutch commander handed over the keys to the city.[^33]

Another significant military achievement came at the Battle of Nördlingen in 1634, where Spanish forces, fighting alongside their Holy Roman Empire allies, defeated the Swedish and Weimarian armies.[^34] This victory temporarily strengthened Spain's position in the Thirty Years' War and demonstrated that Spanish military power, while strained, could still achieve decisive results on European battlefields.[^35]

### Naval Expansion

Shortly after taking power, Philip IV began an ambitious program to increase the size of Spain's naval forces, recognizing the importance of sea power for protecting Spain's far-flung empire and maintaining control over vital Atlantic and Mediterranean trade routes.[^36] Philip rapidly doubled the size of the naval budget from the start of his reign, and then tripled it, demonstrating his commitment to maintaining Spain's maritime dominance.[^37] This expansion was crucial for protecting Spanish interests in the Americas, defending against Dutch and English privateers, and maintaining communications between Spain's scattered territories.[^38]

### Artistic and Cultural Patronage

Philip IV's most enduring achievement was his extraordinary patronage of the arts, which has led many historians to describe his reign as Spain's "Golden Age" of culture, despite the political and military setbacks.[^39] Philip supported a number of prominent painters, including Eugenio Caxés, Vincenzo Carducci, Gonzales Coques, and Angelo Nardi.[^40] However, his most significant artistic relationship was with Diego Velázquez, who originated from Seville and was summoned to Madrid by King Philip IV in 1624.[^41]

Despite some jealousy from existing court painters, Velázquez rapidly became a success with Philip, being retained for the rest of his career until his death.[^42] The King and Velázquez shared common interests in horses, dogs, and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years.[^43] Velázquez became court painter through his skill as a portraitist, painting Philip IV and his family over four decades.[^44]

Philip obtained paintings from across Europe, especially Italy, accumulating over 4,000 by the time of his death; some have termed this unparalleled assemblage a "mega-collection."[^45] This extraordinary collection included works by the greatest masters of the age and formed the foundation of what would later become Spain's premier art museums.[^46]

### The Buen Retiro Palace

The "Planet King" invested in a new palace to display both his art and the ritual of court, commencing the building of the Buen Retiro Palace in Madrid through Olivares.[^47] The palace was designed by architect Alonso Carbonell and built on the orders of Philip IV as a secondary residence and place of recreation.[^48] The palace complex was built within a short space of time (1633-1640), gradually taking shape with the successive addition of new features including royal apartments, courtyards for jousting and bullfights, the Hall of Realms, and a theatre.[^49]

The art collection assembled for the Buen Retiro was extraordinary. In just ten years (1633-1643), some 800 works by Spanish, Italian, and French artists of the stature of Velázquez, Zurbarán, Ribera, Poussin, Claude Lorrain, Lanfranco, and Domenichino were acquired for this residence.[^50] For the Salón de Reinos (royal reception room), a commemorative series of Spanish military triumphs was commissioned, including Diego Velázquez's famous painting "The Surrender of Breda."[^51] The Buen Retiro Palace was decorated with some two hundred landscapes, many of which were bought from private collectors while a great number were also executed purposefully for the palace.[^52]

### Administrative Innovations

During the Thirty Years' War, Philip introduced the "junta" system, a number of small committees across Spain, which functioned in competition with the traditional royal councils.[^53] This administrative reform was an attempt to streamline decision-making and improve the efficiency of government during wartime conditions.[^54] While the junta system had mixed results, it represented an effort to modernize Spanish governance and adapt to the changing demands of warfare and statecraft.[^55]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Union of Arms and Regional Revolts

One of the most controversial policies of Philip IV's reign was the Union de Armas (Union of Arms), championed by the Count-Duke of Olivares in 1625.[^56] The plan involved establishing a force of 140,000 paid soldiers, supported by equitable taxes from across the Empire, with each province contributing to the support of a common military reserve.[^57] This was a thinly disguised attempt to integrate the fiscal institutions of the empire and force non-Castilian territories to bear their share of imperial defense costs.[^58]

The Union de Armas faced significant resistance from Spain's constituent kingdoms. In 1626, Philip IV summoned the Cortes of the Crown of Aragon—Aragon and Valencia reluctantly voted some money but refused conscription of troops, while Catalonia refused everything.[^59] Despite this opposition, Olivares published the royal decree for the Union of Arms, attempting to impose the policy through royal authority.[^60]

The Union of Arms ultimately caused the revolts of Catalonia and Portugal in 1640, marking the worst crisis of Philip's reign.[^61] In 1640, discontent in Catalonia escalated into open rebellion, culminating in the murder of royal officials in Barcelona and the declaration of Catalan independence, with Catalonia aligning with France under King Louis XIII.[^62] The Catalan revolt weakened the Spanish monarchy when it was under attack on multiple fronts and inspired the Portuguese to stage an ultimately successful revolt in December 1640.[^63]

In trying to mobilize Portuguese noble support for the war, Olivares triggered the Portuguese uprising. Lisbon's nobles expelled Philip and gave the throne to the House of Braganza, with the revolt led by John IV of Portugal.[^64] Portugal became independent in 1640 under John IV of the House of Braganza, marking the end of sixty years of the Iberian Union and the beginning of the Portuguese Restoration War.[^65] The worst setback for Spain was the secession of Portugal in 1640, which Philip was forced to accept, lacking the necessary forces to prevent it.[^66]

The loss of, and war in, Catalonia and Portugal increased the pressure on the other territories of the Spanish monarchy, prompting further revolts in Naples and Sicily in 1647-48.[^67] Central royal power was confronted with rebellions in several parts of the kingdom against the prohibitive taxes levied to cover the spiraling costs of the war at a time of economic difficulty.[^68]

### Military Defeats

The Battle of Rocroi, fought on May 19, 1643, was a devastating military defeat that shattered the myth of Spanish military invincibility.[^69] The battle was a major engagement of the Thirty Years' War between a French army, led by the 21-year-old Duke of Enghien (later known as the Great Condé) and Spanish forces under General Francisco de Melo, occurring just five days after the accession of Louis XIV to the throne of France.[^70]

Rocroi shattered the myth of invincibility of the Spanish tercios, the terrifying infantry units that had dominated European battlefields for the previous 120 years.[^71] Melo in his report to the King called it "the most considerable defeat there has ever been in these provinces."[^72] The battle is therefore often considered to mark the end of Spanish military greatness and the beginning of French hegemony in Europe during the 17th century.[^73] For many historians, this battle marked the beginning of the end of Spanish military dominance on the continent.[^74]

In 1639, a Spanish fleet convoying troops to Flanders was destroyed off the English coast, further demonstrating Spain's declining naval power.[^75] Spain's Army of Flanders suffered defeat in France at Rocroi in 1643, and in 1648, after a near eighty-year struggle to suppress the Dutch Revolt in the Low Countries, Philip IV acknowledged the independence of the Dutch Republic in the Peace of Münster.[^76]

### Economic Collapse

In 1627, the Castilian economy collapsed. The Spanish had been using their currency to pay for the war and prices exploded in Spain.[^77] The ruinous expenses of Spain's involvement in the Thirty Years' War forced the government to declare itself bankrupt in 1627.[^78] Olivares had attempted to deal with the problem of Philip's Genoese bankers by declaring a state bankruptcy, but this only worsened Spain's financial crisis.[^79]

Philip had clear intentions to try to control the Spanish currency, which had become increasingly unstable during the reign of his father and grandfather, but in practice, inflation soared.[^80] In the 1630s, new taxes were instituted in Castile along with outright confiscations from private individuals, both of income from government annuities and of American silver imported in commercial transactions.[^81] Another bankruptcy was declared in 1647, demonstrating that Spain's financial problems were structural and could not be easily resolved.[^82]

Spain faced numerous socioeconomic challenges, including a failing agricultural economy, an inequitable tax system, and a diminishing flow of riches from the New World.[^83] By the 1630s, Philip's domestic policies were being increasingly impacted by the financial pressures of the Thirty Years' War, and in particular the growing war with France.[^84]

### Court Corruption and Morality

Under Philip's rule, the Spanish court is supposed to have been a hotbed of pleasure-seeking, rampant favoritism, and pervasive corruption.[^85] Victorian authors were inclined to portray Philip as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched Baroque court.[^86] While modern scholarship has moderated this view, there is no doubt that Philip's court had a reputation for moral laxity that contrasted sharply with the king's public image of piety.[^87]

Philip became known for his numerous affairs, particularly with actresses, as encouraged by the Count-Duke Olivares.[^88] The most famous of these affairs was with the actress María Calderón (La Calderona), with whom he had a son in 1629, Juan José, who was brought up as a royal prince.[^89] María Inés Calderón attracted the attention of the monarch upon her debut at the theatre de Corral de la Cruz in Madrid in 1627.[^90] Upon the birth of her son in 1629, La Calderona lost custody of him despite her protests, and her relationship with the king ended the same year.[^91] In March 1642, María Calderón was forced to become a nun against her will, retiring to the monastery of San Juan Bautista of Valfermoso in the Province of Guadalajara.[^92]

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Family

Philip IV married twice during his reign, both marriages being strategic alliances designed to strengthen Habsburg power.[^93] His first wife was Elisabeth (Isabel) of France, daughter of Henry IV of France and his second Queen Marie de' Medici.[^94] Elisabeth of France, also known as Isabel or Elisabeth of Bourbon (November 22, 1602 – October 6, 1644), was Queen of Spain from 1621 to her death and Queen of Portugal from 1621 to 1640.[^95] After their proxy marriage to the Prince of Asturias, Elisabeth met her future spouse for the first time on November 25, 1615, on Pheasant Island.[^96] In 1621, the couple ascended to the throne of Spain upon the death of Philip III.[^97] They were parents to seven children, though only one son survived to adolescence.[^98]

Philip's first wife, Isabelle, died in 1644, and their only surviving son died two years later in 1646 at the age of seventeen.[^99] The urgent need for a male successor made it necessary for Philip to start searching for a new wife immediately.[^100] The forty-four-year-old widower Philip entered into a marriage with his fifteen-year-old niece Maria Anna (1634-1696) in 1649.[^101]

Mariana of Austria was originally betrothed to her cousin Balthasar Charles, Prince of Asturias, heir to the Spanish throne, but his death soon afterwards left her without a prospective husband and her widowed uncle Philip IV without a successor.[^102] Mariana of Austria was Queen of Spain from 1649 until her husband Philip IV died in 1665 and was appointed Regent for their infant son Charles II, remaining an influential figure until her own death in 1696.[^103]

Philip IV's second wife, Maria Anna (Mariana) of Austria, bore him five children, but only two survived to adulthood: a daughter Margarita Teresa (born in 1651) and the future Charles II of Spain (born in 1661).[^104] Charles II was sickly and considered in frequent danger of dying, making the line of inheritance potentially uncertain.[^105] Philip died in 1665 when his surviving son Charles II was only four years old, expressing the pious hope that his surviving son would be more fortunate than himself.[^106]

### Habsburg Inbreeding

Philip IV married his niece Mariana of Austria in an uncle-niece marriage, which produced Charles II, born in 1661, who was the final outcome of this dynasty and the epitome of Habsburg inbreeding.[^107] Philip IV and Mariana were themselves products of interbreeding, as each of their parents had been second cousins, resulting in an already closely-related couple producing a further inbred child.[^108] This final marriage of uncle and niece resulted in a child that was the genetic equivalent of one born to brother and sister.[^109]

From 1516 to 1700, it has been estimated that over 80% of marriages within the Spanish branch of the Habsburg dynasty were consanguineous.[^110] Most marriages were consanguineous unions: two uncle-niece marriages (Philip II with his niece Anna of Austria and Philip IV with his niece Mariana of Austria), and in total, 9 (81.8%) of 11 marriages were consanguineous unions in a degree of third cousins or closer.[^111] The inbreeding coefficient of the Spanish Habsburg kings increased strongly along generations from 0.025 for King Philip I, the founder of the dynasty, to 0.254 for Charles II, almost as high as would be expected for the offspring of an incestuous marriage (parent-child or brother-sister).[^112]

Mandibular prognathism (the famous "Habsburg jaw") was most pronounced in Philip IV.[^113] Only about 60 percent of infants survived to age 1, and only half of the children born to the dynasty survived to age 10, compared with about 80 percent survival of infants in Spanish villages at the time.[^114]

### Religious Devotion and Spiritual Advisors

Philip is still felt to have been "unduly pious" in his personal life, and from the 1640s onwards he sought the advice and counsel of a noted cloistered abbess, Sor María de Ágreda, exchanging a number of letters with her.[^115] María de Jesús served as the spiritual (and sometimes political) advisor to King Philip IV of Spain, at his request and for more than 22 years.[^116] Their surviving correspondence includes over 600 letters.[^117]

In 1643, King Philip IV of Spain visited María, initiating a correspondence that was maintained until her death.[^118] The king sought her counsel during a difficult period—the King had become detached a few months earlier from the valued Count-Duke de Olivares who for 20 years had directed all his policy.[^119] María is acknowledged as one of Philip's most influential political and spiritual advisors, with their correspondence dealing with both spiritual and political matters, making her a unique figure in 17th-century Spanish history.[^120]

### Personality and Character

The King and Velázquez shared common interests in horses, dogs, and art, and in private they formed an easy, relaxed relationship over the years, suggesting Philip had a warmer and more personable side than his formal portraits might suggest.[^121] Philip was more intelligent than his father Philip III but like him allowed his government to be run by minister-favorites, first Olivares and then Don Luis Méndez de Haro, who remained in office until his death in 1661.[^122]

## Legacy

### The Decline of Spanish Power

By the end of Philip IV's reign, Spain, weakened by military reverses and economic and social distress, had become a second-class power.[^123] By the time of his death, the Spanish Empire had reached approximately 12.2 million square kilometers in area, the largest empire in the world, but in other aspects was in decline, a process to which Philip contributed with his inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform.[^124]

Philip has been held responsible for the decline of Spain, which was mainly due to organic causes largely beyond the control of any one ruler.[^125] Although recent historiography has portrayed Olivares as a frustrated apostle of centralizing absolutism (and thus a modernizer), the count-duke fully shared (in fact, he shaped) his king's dynastic views and sought means to wage war with an imperious single-mindedness that nearly destroyed the monarchy.[^126] Draining the domestic foundations of their power to pursue unrealistic dreams of imperial glory, Philip and his ministers profoundly misunderstood the roots of, and thereby hastened, Spain's seventeenth-century decline.[^127]

Philip's reign (1621-1665) was characterized by political and military adversity.[^128] His Unión De Armas scheme to get non-Castilian provinces to share the costs of imperial defense ultimately led to the revolt of Catalonia in 1640.[^129] During his reign, Spanish foreign power declined; he failed to regain control of the north Netherlands and lost wars against France.[^130]

### Cultural Golden Age

Despite political difficulties, Philip has been remembered both for the "astonishing enthusiasm" with which he collected art and for his love of theatre.[^131] Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderón de la Barca, or the painters Fray Juan Bautista Maíno, Vicente Carducho, and Diego Velázquez, amongst others, benefited from the monarch's patronage.[^132] Scholars often associate Philip's reign (1621-1665) with decline, decadence, crisis, stagnation, and adversity (as did many contemporaries); yet the glittering cultural and artistic achievements (enhanced by his patronage) of the period led it to be dubbed "the" Golden Age.[^133]

His legacy is a complex interplay of artistic brilliance and the sobering realities of a declining empire, as Spain navigated its waning influence in Europe while continuing to serve as a bastion of Catholicism.[^134] Philip was an avid collector and patron of the arts, and the building and decoration of the Buen Retiro Palace was his greatest artistic enterprise.[^135]

### Territorial Losses and Treaties

In 1648, after a near eighty-year struggle to suppress the Dutch Revolt in the Low Countries, Philip IV acknowledged the independence of the Dutch Republic.[^136] Philip also oversaw the increasingly futile war with the Dutch, which ended with the 1648 Treaty of Münster and the independence of the United Provinces.[^137] The Peace of Münster, signed on January 30, 1648, was a treaty between Philip IV of Spain and the Lords States General of the Dutch Republic, ratified by King Philip IV in Madrid on March 1, and by the Assembly of the States General in The Hague on April 18.[^138]

Fighting continued between France and Spain until the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.[^139] In the Peace of the Pyrenees, concluded with France in 1659, Spain gave up Artois and territories in the Spanish Netherlands, together with Rosellón and part of Cerdaña.[^140] Philip IV died on September 17, 1665, just before Portugal's independence was recognized.[^141]

### The Succession Crisis

Philip died expressing the pious hope that his surviving son, Charles II, who was only 4 years old at the time, would be more fortunate than himself.[^142] Charles II succeeded his father Philip IV to the throne on September 17, 1665, and his mother, Mariana of Austria, ruled as Regent until he was officially declared of age in November 1675.[^143] Charles II married Marie Louise d'Orléans with no issue, and secondly married Maria Anna of Neuburg, also with no issue.[^144]

In his last will and testament, signed on October 3, 1700, Charles II named Philip of Bourbon as his successor, and died in Madrid on November 1 of the same year.[^145] Charles II was the last Habsburg King of Spain, and inbreeding so incapacitated the Habsburgs that by the death of King Charles II of Spain in 1700, they were virtually unable to reproduce.[^146]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

For some years, scholars have generally agreed that Philip IV was a somewhat better king than the other late Hapsburgs, and that on the whole his reign was more successful than those of Philip III and Charles II.[^147] Some biographers have seen in this member of the Habsburg dynasty a person of integrity and a well-meaning and intelligent monarch who was better suited to royal office than his father.[^148] According to this view, it was thanks to him that Spain was able to preserve at least the façade of a Great Power and that its decline was slowed.[^149]

Modern scholarship has shifted toward a more nuanced view of Philip IV.[^150] Philip has in the past been considered to be "unimaginative" in his politics, but recent histories have stressed the more radical elements of his first two decades in power.[^151] Perceptions of Philip's personality have altered considerably over time, with contemporary historians recognizing that he faced extraordinarily difficult circumstances that would have challenged any ruler.[^152]

Philip's patronage of the arts remains one of the most celebrated aspects of his legacy. His support for Diego Velázquez alone would ensure his place in cultural history, as it resulted in some of the greatest masterpieces of Western art.[^153] The art collection he assembled formed the foundation of Spain's premier museums and contributed to the preservation of countless masterworks that might otherwise have been lost.[^154]

### Negative Views

Victorian authors were inclined to portray Philip as a weak individual, delegating excessively to his ministers, and ruling over a debauched Baroque court.[^155] Scholars often associate Philip's reign (1621-1665) with decline, decadence, crisis, stagnation, and adversity (as did many contemporaries).[^156] Philip has been held responsible for the decline of Spain, though modern historians recognize that this was mainly due to organic causes largely beyond the control of any one ruler.[^157]

Although recent historiography has portrayed Olivares as a frustrated apostle of centralizing absolutism (and thus a modernizer), the count-duke fully shared (in fact, he shaped) his king's dynastic views and sought means to wage war with an imperious single-mindedness that nearly destroyed the monarchy.[^158] Draining the domestic foundations of their power to pursue unrealistic dreams of imperial glory, Philip and his ministers profoundly misunderstood the roots of, and thereby hastened, Spain's seventeenth-century decline.[^159]

By the end of his reign, Spain, weakened by military reverses and economic and social distress, had become a second-class power, a transformation that occurred during Philip's watch.[^160] His inability to achieve successful domestic and military reform, combined with his reliance on favorites like Olivares, contributed to Spain's decline from the preeminent European power to a secondary status.[^161] The loss of Portugal in 1640 and the humiliating acknowledgment of Dutch independence in 1648 represented permanent diminishments of Spanish power that Philip was unable to prevent.[^162]
