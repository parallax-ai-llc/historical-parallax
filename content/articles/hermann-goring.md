## Summary

Hermann Wilhelm Göring was a German military and political leader who served as one of the most powerful figures in Nazi Germany. A World War I flying ace credited with 22 victories, Göring became Adolf Hitler's designated successor and held multiple high-ranking positions including Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, Minister of Aviation, and Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan. He was instrumental in establishing the Gestapo and concentration camp system, and played a central role in the persecution of Jews and other minorities. Convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials, Göring committed suicide by cyanide poisoning hours before his scheduled execution in 1946.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Hermann Wilhelm Göring was born on January 12, 1893, in Rosenheim, Bavaria, to Heinrich Ernst Göring, a former cavalry officer and colonial administrator, and his wife Franziska Tiefenbrunn. His father served as the first Governor-General of German South-West Africa (now Namibia), which gave the family a connection to Germany's colonial ambitions. Hermann was the fourth of five children, and his early childhood was marked by his father's frequent absences due to colonial service.[^3][^4]

Göring's early years were spent at Veldenstein Castle near Nuremberg, the property of his godfather Hermann Epenstein von Mauternburg, a wealthy physician of Jewish descent who was his mother's lover. This arrangement, while scandalous, provided young Hermann with an aristocratic upbringing in grand surroundings. The relationship between his mother and Epenstein profoundly affected Göring's childhood, creating a complex family dynamic that some biographers suggest influenced his later personality development.[^5][^6]

From an early age, Göring displayed a militaristic temperament and was fascinated by military matters. He attended boarding school at Ansbach and later the military academy at Karlsruhe, where he proved to be a capable but headstrong student. His education emphasized Prussian military values of discipline, hierarchy, and loyalty to the state. In 1912, he graduated from the Prussian Cadet Corps at Lichterfelde and received his commission as a lieutenant in the Prince Wilhelm Regiment.[^7][^8]

Göring's personality during his youth was characterized by ambition, vanity, and a craving for recognition. He developed an early love of pageantry, uniforms, and decorations that would later manifest in his extravagant lifestyle and multiple self-awarded medals. His upbringing in aristocratic surroundings, combined with his family's modest actual wealth, created in him a desire for the trappings of power and prestige that would define much of his later career.[^9]

## Rise to Power

When World War I broke out in 1914, Göring initially served as an infantry officer but soon transferred to the Imperial German Air Service. He proved to be a natural pilot and quickly distinguished himself in aerial combat. By 1917, he was commanding Jagdstaffel 27, a fighter squadron, and earned the Iron Cross First Class for his bravery. In July 1918, following the death of the legendary Manfred von Richthofen (the "Red Baron"), Göring was appointed commander of Jagdgeschwader 1, the famous "Flying Circus" squadron, and was awarded the Pour le Mérite, Imperial Germany's highest military honor.[^10][^11]

The end of World War I and Germany's defeat devastated Göring both personally and professionally. He refused to surrender his squadron's aircraft as required by the armistice terms, instead ordering them destroyed or flown to Germany. He found the Weimar Republic humiliating and was deeply resentful of the Treaty of Versailles. After the war, Göring worked as a commercial pilot in Scandinavia, where he met and married Carin von Kantzow, a Swedish baroness who introduced him to high society and reinforced his aristocratic pretensions.[^12][^13]

Göring's entry into Nazi politics came in 1922 when he heard Adolf Hitler speak at a rally in Munich. Captivated by Hitler's nationalist message and charismatic oratory, Göring joined the fledgling Nazi Party and quickly became one of Hitler's closest associates. His status as a war hero and decorated officer lent credibility to the movement and helped attract other veterans. Hitler appointed him commander of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the party's paramilitary wing, in late 1922.[^14][^15]

During the failed Beer Hall Putsch of November 1923, Göring marched alongside Hitler in the attempted coup in Munich. When police opened fire on the marchers, Göring was seriously wounded in the groin and leg. He fled to Austria with his wife, where he received medical treatment. During his recovery, he was given morphine for pain, beginning an addiction that would plague him for years. He also developed a bitter resentment toward those he felt had betrayed the putsch.[^16][^17]

Göring spent the next few years in exile, living in Italy and Sweden, becoming increasingly addicted to morphine and gaining considerable weight. His wife Carin's health deteriorated, and the couple faced financial difficulties. After a general amnesty in 1927, Göring returned to Germany and rejoined the Nazi Party. He worked to rebuild his relationship with Hitler and began leveraging his social connections to introduce Nazi leaders to wealthy industrialists and aristocrats who could fund the movement.[^18][^19]

The breakthrough in Göring's political career came with the Nazi Party's electoral successes in the early 1930s. In 1928, he was elected to the Reichstag, and by 1932, he had become President of the Reichstag, Germany's parliament. This position gave him significant political legitimacy and a platform to advance Nazi policies. He used his parliamentary immunity to shield himself and other Nazis from legal consequences while orchestrating political maneuvers that helped destabilize the Weimar Republic.[^20][^21]

When Hitler was appointed Chancellor on January 30, 1933, Göring was named Minister without Portfolio and Prussian Minister of the Interior, giving him control over Prussia's police forces. He immediately began purging the police of republican elements and recruiting Nazi stormtroopers as auxiliary police. In February 1933, Göring established the Geheime Staatspolizei (Gestapo), the secret state police that would become synonymous with Nazi terror. He also created the first concentration camps to imprison political opponents, communists, and others deemed enemies of the state.[^22][^23]

## Major Achievements

Göring's most significant institutional achievement was the creation and development of the Luftwaffe, Nazi Germany's air force. After being appointed Reich Commissioner of Aviation in 1933, he worked tirelessly to build a modern air force despite the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles. Under his leadership, the Luftwaffe grew from nothing to become one of the world's most formidable air forces by the late 1930s. He invested heavily in aircraft production, pilot training, and aeronautical research, establishing Germany as a major air power.[^24][^25]

In 1936, Hitler appointed Göring Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, making him effectively the economic dictator of Germany. In this role, Göring oversaw the mobilization of the German economy for war, focusing on autarky (economic self-sufficiency) and rearmament. He directed the expansion of synthetic fuel production, increased iron and steel output, and coordinated the exploitation of resources from occupied territories. The Four Year Plan accelerated Germany's military buildup and prepared the economy for Hitler's expansionist ambitions.[^26][^27]

Göring played a central role in the annexation of Austria (Anschluss) in March 1938. As an Austrian by heritage (though born in Bavaria), he had personal interest in the union of Germany and Austria. He pressured Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg through threats and diplomatic intimidation, helping to orchestrate the political conditions that allowed German troops to occupy Austria without resistance. Following the annexation, Göring oversaw the "Aryanization" of Austrian Jewish property, personally selecting valuable art and assets for his own collection.[^28][^29]

During the Sudetenland crisis of 1938, Göring participated in the Munich Conference alongside Hitler, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and French Premier Édouard Daladier. While he later claimed to have been a moderating influence urging peaceful resolution, Göring fully supported Hitler's territorial demands and helped secure the agreement that forced Czechoslovakia to cede the Sudetenland to Germany. The Munich Agreement represented the peak of Nazi Germany's diplomatic achievements before the outbreak of war.[^30][^31]

Following the anti-Jewish pogrom of Kristallnacht in November 1938, Göring was tasked with coordinating the "Jewish Question" from an economic standpoint. He chaired the meeting on November 12, 1938, where he imposed a massive collective fine of one billion Reichsmarks on Germany's Jewish community and announced measures to exclude Jews from the German economy. He declared, "I would not want to be a Jew in Germany," revealing his role in the systematic persecution that would eventually lead to the Holocaust.[^32][^33]

In 1939, Hitler designated Göring as his official successor, a position formalized in a decree stating that if anything happened to Hitler, Göring would assume all his offices and powers. This made Göring the second most powerful man in Nazi Germany and confirmed his position at the apex of the regime's hierarchy. He was also awarded the rank of Reichsmarschall in 1940, a special rank created specifically for him that placed him above all other German military officers.[^34][^35]

The early phase of World War II saw the Luftwaffe achieve significant tactical successes under Göring's overall command. In the invasion of Poland (1939), the Low Countries and France (1940), the air force provided crucial support for the rapid German victories. The stunning defeat of France in just six weeks was attributed in part to the Luftwaffe's effectiveness in close air support and interdiction of Allied forces. These victories enhanced Göring's prestige and seemed to validate his leadership of Germany's air arm.[^36][^37]

Göring amassed enormous personal wealth through corruption, extortion, and outright theft. He confiscated Jewish property, accepted "gifts" from industrialists seeking favors, and looted art treasures from occupied territories. His country estate at Carinhall, named after his first wife, became a repository for stolen masterpieces from across Europe. He established the Hermann Göring Works, a state-owned industrial conglomerate that exploited slave labor and resources from conquered territories, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in Germany.[^38][^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Göring's role in establishing the Nazi terror apparatus represents one of his most damning legacies. As Prussian Minister of the Interior, he created the Gestapo in 1933 and established the first concentration camps, including Oranienburg. He boasted publicly about these camps, stating that he cared nothing for legal niceties and that his mission was to destroy the enemies of the state. While he later transferred control of the Gestapo to Heinrich Himmler in 1934, Göring had laid the foundations for the systematic repression that characterized Nazi rule.[^40][^41]

The failure of the Luftwaffe during the Battle of Britain in 1940 marked the beginning of Göring's decline. Despite his confident predictions that air power alone could force Britain to surrender, the Luftwaffe failed to achieve air superiority over the Royal Air Force. Göring's tactical decisions, including shifting from attacking RAF airfields to bombing cities, proved strategically flawed. The defeat was a personal humiliation for Göring and undermined Hitler's confidence in his abilities. He began to retreat from active military leadership, spending more time at his estates.[^42][^43]

Göring's promise to supply the encircled Sixth Army at Stalingrad by airlift in winter 1942-43 proved catastrophically wrong. Despite warnings from Luftwaffe transport commanders that it was impossible to deliver the required 300 tons of supplies daily, Göring assured Hitler it could be done. The actual daily average was less than 100 tons. The failure of the airlift contributed directly to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of German soldiers and the eventual surrender of the Sixth Army, one of the worst German defeats of the war.[^44][^45]

As the war turned against Germany, Göring became increasingly detached from reality and from his duties. He spent more time at Carinhall enjoying his art collection, hunting, and indulging in various pleasures while the Luftwaffe was being overwhelmed by Allied air forces. His morphine addiction worsened, his weight ballooned, and he appeared in increasingly bizarre uniforms and costumes of his own design. Subordinates found him difficult to reach and uninterested in addressing the crisis facing Germany's air defenses.[^46][^47]

The destruction of German cities by Allied bombing raids represented a complete failure of Göring's promises to protect the homeland. He had famously boasted in 1939 that if enemy aircraft ever reached the Ruhr, "you can call me Meyer" (a Jewish surname, meant as a humiliating forfeit). By 1943-44, Allied bombers were devastating German cities almost with impunity. Citizens began sarcastically calling Göring "Meyer," and his public credibility evaporated. Hitler increasingly blamed him for the Luftwaffe's failures and excluded him from important military decisions.[^48][^49]

Göring's extensive looting of art and cultural treasures from occupied Europe represents one of history's largest systematic thefts. He accumulated approximately 1,500 paintings, including works by Vermeer, Rembrandt, and other masters, almost all stolen from Jewish collectors and museums. He employed art historians and dealers to identify and acquire valuable pieces, often using his official position to claim them before other Nazi leaders could. After the war, Allied forces recovered much of his collection, but many items remained missing.[^50][^51]

His role in the Holocaust, while less direct than leaders like Himmler and Heydrich, was nonetheless significant. Göring signed orders for the "Final Solution of the Jewish Question," authorized the creation of Jewish ghettos, and profited personally from the expropriation of Jewish property. At the Wannsee Conference in July 1941, it was Göring's authorization that gave Reinhard Heydrich the mandate to coordinate the systematic murder of European Jews. His claims at Nuremberg that he was unaware of the death camps were contradicted by substantial evidence.[^52][^53]

The final betrayal came in April 1945 when Göring attempted to assume leadership of Germany after Hitler was trapped in Berlin. Göring sent a telegram from Bavaria asking if he should take over as agreed in the 1939 succession decree. Hitler, influenced by Martin Bormann, interpreted this as treason and ordered Göring's arrest. He was stripped of all ranks, positions, and party membership. This dramatic fall from grace demonstrated how completely Göring had lost Hitler's confidence and how his years of self-indulgence had destroyed his political position.[^54][^55]

## Personal Life

Hermann Göring married twice, with both marriages significantly influencing his life and career. His first wife, Carin von Kantzow (née Baroness Fock), was a Swedish aristocrat whom he met in 1920 while working as a commercial pilot. Carin left her husband and son to marry Göring in 1923. She was devoted to him during his difficult years of exile and morphine addiction, providing emotional and financial support. Her death from heart failure in 1931 devastated Göring, who named his country estate Carinhall in her memory and maintained an almost cult-like devotion to her memory throughout his life.[^56][^57]

In 1935, Göring married Emmy Sonnemann, a provincial actress whom he had met in 1932. The wedding was a lavish state occasion attended by Hitler and the Nazi elite, broadcast on radio throughout Germany. Emmy provided Göring with social companionship and bore him his only child, daughter Edda, in 1938. The birth was celebrated as a national event, and Edda was showered with gifts from across Germany. Emmy remained loyal to Göring throughout the war and until his death, though she lived a much quieter life afterward, dying in 1973.[^58][^59]

Göring's personality was characterized by extreme contradictions. He could be charming, witty, and jovial in social settings, with a reputation for hosting lavish parties and entertaining guests with humor. Yet he was also capable of extreme ruthlessness, ordering mass arrests, torture, and executions without apparent remorse. His vanity was legendary—he designed elaborate uniforms for himself, wore excessive makeup, and surrounded himself with luxury even as German civilians faced increasing hardships during the war.[^60][^61]

His morphine addiction, which began after his injury during the Beer Hall Putsch, remained a problem throughout much of his life. He underwent treatment in Sweden in 1925-26, spending time in a psychiatric institution where he exhibited violent behavior. While he apparently reduced his use in the 1930s, he relapsed during the stress of the war years. At the time of his capture in 1945, he was taking paracodeine tablets regularly. During his imprisonment at Nuremberg, he was forced to undergo withdrawal and lost considerable weight.[^62][^63]

Göring's love of luxury, hunting, and art collecting became increasingly problematic as the war progressed. He maintained multiple residences, including Carinhall, which contained a vast hunting estate, art galleries, and even a private zoo. He enjoyed dressing in hunting costumes, Roman togas, and other theatrical outfits. His extravagant lifestyle stood in stark contrast to the propaganda of sacrifice promoted to the German people and contributed to public resentment as conditions worsened.[^64][^65]

Despite his brutality in political matters, Göring showed some capacity for loyalty to individuals. He protected Erhard Milch, his deputy in the Luftwaffe, despite Milch's partial Jewish ancestry. He intervened on behalf of some individuals facing persecution, though these acts were selective and often motivated by personal connection rather than principle. He maintained friendships with some former World War I comrades regardless of their politics, demonstrating that his relationships predating Nazism retained some value to him.[^66][^67]

## Legacy

Hermann Göring's legacy is that of a war criminal whose actions contributed to some of the worst atrocities of the twentieth century. As one of the principal architects of Nazi Germany's terror apparatus and a key leader in the regime that perpetrated the Holocaust, Göring bears direct responsibility for millions of deaths. His role in establishing concentration camps, implementing anti-Jewish measures, and authorizing the "Final Solution" places him among history's most notorious criminals. No reassessment of his military or administrative capabilities can overshadow these crimes.[^68][^69]

The Nuremberg Trials, where Göring was the most prominent defendant, established important precedents in international law regarding crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against peace. His conviction on all counts demonstrated that political and military leaders could be held personally accountable for their actions, even when following orders from superiors. The trial proceedings, where Göring attempted to defend Nazi ideology while denying knowledge of specific atrocities, revealed the mechanisms through which ordinary governmental and military structures were perverted to serve genocidal ends.[^70][^71]

Göring's suicide hours before his scheduled execution denied the Allies the symbolic closure of executing the highest-ranking Nazi leader in their custody. By ingesting cyanide he had somehow concealed during months of imprisonment, he exercised one final act of defiance and maintained control over his fate. The mystery of how he obtained the poison has never been definitively resolved, though it likely involved a guard or visitor. His death prevented the execution from serving as the final repudiation of his crimes that the prosecutors had intended.[^72][^73]

In military history, Göring is studied as an example of how personal failings and political considerations can undermine military effectiveness. His transformation from a competent World War I fighter pilot to an ineffective World War II air force commander illustrates how past achievements do not guarantee future success. His reluctance to accept bad news, his poor strategic judgment, and his increasing detachment from operational realities are cited as cautionary examples in military leadership studies.[^74][^75]

The recovered artworks from Göring's collection raised important questions about looted cultural property that remain relevant today. Many pieces were returned to their rightful owners or heirs, but the process established legal and ethical frameworks for addressing art theft during wartime. Museums and collectors worldwide still occasionally discover works that passed through Göring's hands, requiring research into provenance and sometimes restitution. His collecting represents one of history's largest systematic thefts of cultural heritage.[^76][^77]

Göring's environmental legacy is darkly ironic. He was an enthusiastic hunter and conservationist who established game reserves and protective legislation for forests and wildlife in Germany. The 1935 Reich Nature Protection Act, passed under his authority as Reich Master of the Hunt and Reich Master of Forestry, contained advanced conservation principles. However, this concern for nature stood in grotesque contradiction to his complete disregard for human life, particularly of those deemed racially inferior by Nazi ideology.[^78][^79]

In popular culture, Göring has been portrayed in numerous films, books, and documentaries, usually as a symbol of Nazi excess, corruption, and brutality. His corpulence, elaborate uniforms, and art collection have made him a recognizable figure representing the venality of Nazi leadership. These portrayals, while sometimes verging on caricature, generally capture the essence of his character: ambitious, ruthless, vain, and ultimately responsible for enormous suffering.[^80][^81]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Even among scholars who condemn Göring's crimes, some acknowledge his administrative and organizational capabilities in the early Nazi period. Historian Richard Overy notes that Göring demonstrated considerable skill in building the Luftwaffe from essentially nothing into a formidable air force within a few years. His ability to coordinate industrial production, recruit and train personnel, and develop tactical doctrine showed genuine executive talent, even if applied to immoral ends. These capabilities made him genuinely useful to Hitler in the 1930s.[^82][^83]

Some historians give Göring limited credit for occasionally attempting to moderate Hitler's most aggressive impulses, particularly regarding the risk of premature war with Britain and France. During the 1938 Sudetenland crisis, Göring reportedly advised Hitler to accept diplomatic solutions and feared that Germany was not yet ready for a major conflict. While these interventions were motivated by practical concerns rather than moral objections, they represented a slightly less reckless approach than Hitler's intuitive gambles.[^84][^85]

Military historians note that Göring's personal courage in World War I was genuine and that his record as a fighter pilot was legitimately distinguished. His Pour le Mérite was earned through actual combat achievements, not political favoritism. Some scholars argue that understanding his transformation from a decorated war hero to a war criminal requires acknowledging that his military virtues were real before they were corrupted by ideology, addiction, and power.[^86]

A few scholars emphasize that Göring's protection of certain individuals from Nazi persecution, while limited and inconsistent, did save some lives. His interventions on behalf of Erhard Milch and a handful of others demonstrated that he retained some capacity for personal loyalty beyond ideological considerations. However, these isolated acts do not significantly mitigate his overall record, and historians who mention them generally do so to illustrate the complexity of human behavior rather than to rehabilitate his reputation.[^87]

Some economic historians acknowledge that the Four Year Plan, despite its militaristic aims and exploitative methods, did demonstrate Göring's ability to mobilize resources on a massive scale. The synthetic fuel programs, expansion of industrial capacity, and coordination of research and development showed administrative competence. However, these achievements are inseparable from their purpose—preparing for aggressive war and conquest—and relied heavily on slave labor and stolen resources.[^88]

### Negative Views

The scholarly consensus regarding Göring is overwhelmingly condemnatory. Historian Geoffrey Megargee describes him as "one of the most evil men of the twentieth century," whose hands were "covered with the blood of millions." His establishment of the Gestapo and concentration camp system, his role in the Holocaust, and his looting of occupied territories place him among the principal perpetrators of Nazi crimes. No technical competencies or isolated humane acts can offset this fundamental moral verdict.[^89][^90]

Military historians emphasize Göring's catastrophic failures as Luftwaffe commander-in-chief. His poor strategic decisions during the Battle of Britain, his impossible promises at Stalingrad, and his failure to defend Germany against Allied bombing caused hundreds of thousands of unnecessary deaths and contributed directly to Germany's defeat. Historian James Corum argues that Göring's leadership represented a case study in how political loyalty rather than military competence came to dominate Nazi military appointments.[^91][^92]

Göring's notorious corruption and self-enrichment have been extensively documented by historians. His systematic looting of art, his "Hermann Göring Works" that exploited slave labor, and his acceptance of bribes from industrialists made him perhaps the most corrupt member of the Nazi leadership. Historian Jonathan Petropoulos describes Göring's art collection as "the largest single act of art theft by an individual in history," representing not just greed but cultural barbarism on an unprecedented scale.[^93][^94]

Psychohistorians and biographers have analyzed Göring's personality as combining narcissism, sadism, and moral emptiness. His biographer Richard Overy describes him as someone who lacked any coherent ideology beyond personal advancement and devotion to Hitler. His vanity, addiction, and hedonism created a personality incapable of genuine empathy or ethical restraint. These personal failings were not merely private vices but contributed directly to his political crimes.[^95][^96]

Holocaust scholars emphasize Göring's direct culpability in the genocide of European Jews. His July 31, 1941 authorization to Reinhard Heydrich to prepare "the final solution of the Jewish question" was a key bureaucratic step toward systematic mass murder. Historian Raul Hilberg identifies Göring as one of the principal decision-makers whose orders set the Holocaust in motion. His claims at Nuremberg that he was unaware of death camps were contradicted by extensive documentary evidence.[^97][^98]

Legal scholars view Göring's trial at Nuremberg as establishing crucial precedents for prosecuting crimes against humanity. The evidence presented against him—his establishment of concentration camps, his authorization of the Final Solution, his looting, his aggressive war planning—demonstrated how international law could address state-sponsored criminality. His conviction on all counts established that "following orders" was not a defense for participating in genocide and crimes against humanity.[^99][^100]

Contemporary German historians emphasize the importance of remembering figures like Göring accurately, without romanticization or mythology. The tendency to view him as a "more moderate" Nazi compared to Himmler or Heydrich is rejected as historically inaccurate and morally problematic. Göring was a enthusiastic participant in Nazi crimes from the beginning, and his later ineffectiveness as a military leader does not diminish his responsibility for the terror apparatus he helped create.[^101][^102]
