## Summary

Stephen Jay Gould was an American paleontologist, evolutionary biologist, and science writer who co-proposed the theory of punctuated equilibrium with Niles Eldredge. This theory suggests that evolution occurs in rapid bursts followed by long periods of stability, challenging gradualism. He was one of the most influential and widely read science writers of the 20th century.
