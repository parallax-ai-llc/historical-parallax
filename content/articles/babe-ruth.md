## Summary

George Herman "Babe" Ruth Jr. (1895-1948) was an American professional baseball player who is widely regarded as the greatest baseball player of all time. Originally a dominant pitcher, Ruth became legendary as a power hitter, revolutionizing the game with his home run prowess. His 714 career home runs (record until 1974) and single-season 60 (1927) defined an era. Playing primarily for the New York Yankees, Ruth led them to seven pennants and four World Series titles. His larger-than-life personality, appetite for excess, and status as America's first true sports celebrity made "The Bambino" an icon whose name remains synonymous with athletic greatness.
