## Summary

Ruth Sager discovered non-chromosomal (cytoplasmic) inheritance in the alga Chlamydomonas, demonstrating that genes outside the nucleus also play hereditary roles. She later became a pioneer in cancer genetics, identifying tumor suppressor genes. Her work on epigenetics and extrachromosomal inheritance was decades ahead of its time.
