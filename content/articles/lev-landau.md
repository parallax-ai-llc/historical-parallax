## Summary

Lev Landau was a Soviet theoretical physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1962 for his pioneering theories of condensed matter, especially liquid helium. He made fundamental contributions to many areas of theoretical physics including quantum mechanics, superfluidity, and the theory of phase transitions. His Course of Theoretical Physics textbooks remain among the most influential in physics education. Landau is considered one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century.
