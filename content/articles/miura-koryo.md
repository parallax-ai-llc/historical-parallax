## Summary

Miura Koryo is a Japanese astrophysicist and structural engineer who invented the Miura fold, a rigid origami folding pattern used in space solar panel deployment. This ingenious folding method allows large flat surfaces to be compactly folded and deployed with a single pull. It has been used in satellite solar arrays and has applications in engineering and mathematics.
