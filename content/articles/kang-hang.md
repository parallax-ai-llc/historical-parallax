## Summary

Kang Hang (Korean: 강항; Hanja: 姜沆; 1567–1618) was a Korean Neo-Confucian scholar and government official during the Joseon Dynasty who became one of the most important cultural bridges between Korea and Japan during a turbulent period in East Asian history. Captured by Japanese forces in 1597 during the Imjin War, he spent three years in captivity, during which he documented Japanese society, politics, and military organization in his seminal work, the Kanyangnok (看羊錄, "Record of a Shepherd"). His writings not only provided invaluable intelligence to the Korean government but also profoundly influenced the development of Neo-Confucianism in early Tokugawa Japan through his intellectual exchanges with Japanese scholars, particularly Fujiwara Seika. Kang's legacy endures as both a loyal servant of Korea who maintained his cultural identity under duress and as an unwitting cultural ambassador whose captivity fostered crucial intellectual connections between two nations locked in conflict.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Kang Hang was born in 1567 in Yubong, located in Chŏlla Province (present-day South Jeolla Province), during the reign of King Seonjo of the Joseon Dynasty.[^4] As a member of the yangban scholar-official class, Kang received a rigorous classical education steeped in Confucian texts and Chinese philosophy. His formative years coincided with a period of relative peace and cultural flourishing in Korea, during which Neo-Confucianism—particularly the interpretation developed by the Korean philosopher Yi Hwang (T'oegye)—had become the dominant intellectual framework for the educated elite.[^5]

Kang demonstrated exceptional scholarly aptitude from an early age, immersing himself in the study of Confucian classics, Chinese history, and the philosophical works of Zhu Xi, the architect of Neo-Confucianism. The educational system of Joseon Korea emphasized moral cultivation, loyalty to the king, filial piety, and the maintenance of proper hierarchical relationships—principles that would profoundly shape Kang's worldview and his later writings.[^6] His education prepared him not only for civil service but also instilled in him a strong sense of cultural superiority vis-à-vis neighboring countries that had not fully embraced the Confucian worldview.

By 1597, Kang had attained the position of Assistant Section Chief in the Board of Punishments (Hyeongjo), one of the Six Ministries that formed the backbone of the Joseon government bureaucracy.[^7] This position, while not among the highest ranks of officialdom, reflected his successful navigation of the competitive gwageo examination system and demonstrated his competence in administrative and legal matters. His appointment to the Board of Punishments placed him in a position of responsibility during a critical period when Korea faced its greatest existential threat in centuries.

The geopolitical landscape of East Asia in the late sixteenth century was characterized by Japan's unification under Toyotomi Hideyoshi and his subsequent ambitions for continental expansion. In 1592, Hideyoshi launched the first of two massive invasions of Korea, initiating the Imjin War (1592-1598), which would devastate the Korean peninsula and dramatically alter the course of East Asian history. It was against this backdrop of war and chaos that Kang Hang's life would take an unexpected turn, transforming him from a provincial official into an involuntary cultural emissary and chronicler of enemy society.[^8][^9]

## Capture and Captivity in Japan

In 1597, during the second phase of the Japanese invasions known as the Keichō Campaign, Kang Hang received orders to help organize volunteer militia forces and coordinate the transportation of military provisions in Chŏlla Province, a strategically vital region in southwestern Korea.[^10] Responding to his letters of exhortation, several hundred patriotic scholars volunteered to join the defensive efforts. However, Japanese forces under the command of various daimyo had already penetrated deep into the region, and a battalion crossed the Noryŏng mountains, infiltrating along the coastline. The volunteer army, composed largely of untrained civilians, dispersed rapidly in the face of the professional Japanese military forces.[^11]

On the eighth day of the second month of 1597, shortly after Kang had been granted leave from his post in the Board of Punishments, he and his entire family were captured by Japanese forces off the coast of Chŏlla Province, near his hometown of Yubong.[^12] Among the hundreds of thousands of Korean civilians and prisoners of war taken to Japan during the invasions, Kang and his family became captives of Tōdō Takatora (1556–1630), a prominent daimyo who would later become famous as one of Japan's greatest castle architects.[^13]

Kang's captivity followed a circuitous path through several locations in Japan. Initially, he and his family were held in Ōzu Castle in Shikoku for approximately ten months. The conditions of captivity varied considerably depending on one's captor; Korean prisoners ranged from slaves sold to Portuguese merchants and shipped to Southeast Asia, to skilled artisans (particularly potters) who were valued for their technical expertise, to educated prisoners like Kang who attracted the interest of Japanese intellectuals.[^14][^15] In the ninth month of 1598—coinciding with the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the subsequent Japanese withdrawal from Korea—Kang and his family were moved to Osaka, and subsequently to Fushimi, a district near Kyoto that served as a political and cultural center during the transition from Hideyoshi's regime to the Tokugawa shogunate.[^16]

During his three years of captivity, Kang Hang maintained his identity as a Korean Neo-Confucian scholar while simultaneously observing and documenting every aspect of Japanese society he encountered. His captivity coincided with one of the most transformative periods in Japanese history—the consolidation of power by Tokugawa Ieyasu, the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, and the beginning of what would become over two centuries of relative peace and isolation. Kang had an unprecedented opportunity to observe the inner workings of Japanese politics, military organization, social structures, religious institutions, and cultural practices from an insider's perspective, albeit an involuntary one.[^17]

The changing political situation in Japan following Hideyoshi's death created opportunities for escape that had not existed during the war. After several failed attempts to flee, Kang and his family, with the assistance of sympathetic Japanese guards and others who facilitated their departure, successfully escaped from Fushimi and returned to Chosŏn Korea in the fifth month of 1600.[^18] Their return came at a moment when the Tokugawa and anti-Tokugawa forces were maneuvering toward the decisive Battle of Sekigahara, which would determine Japan's political future for the next 268 years.

## Major Achievements

### The Kanyangnok: Intelligence and Literature

Kang Hang's most significant achievement was the composition of the Kanyangnok (看羊錄), translated as "The Record of a Shepherd" or "Record of Tending Sheep," a comprehensive account of his observations and experiences during captivity in Japan. The title itself carries profound meaning: the metaphor of shepherding references both his role as a scholar-official responsible for guiding people and his situation as a captive watching over his family and fellow Koreans in enemy territory.[^19] Arranged and printed in the seventeenth century, the Kanyangnok became one of the most valuable intelligence documents the Korean government possessed regarding Japanese society, offering fresh perspectives on a civilization that had been largely isolated from Korean contact for over 150 years.[^20]

The work is remarkable for its comprehensive scope and analytical depth. Kang begins with a detailed historical overview of Japanese rulers, tracing the lineage from ancient emperors through the medieval period to contemporary figures like Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582) and Toyotomi Hideyoshi. He provides extensive analysis of Japan's military rule, the landholding systems of warrior elites in the provinces, and the complex relationships between the imperial court, the military government, and regional daimyo.[^21] Drawing on statistics compiled by ninth-century monks, Kang discusses religious institutions, population demographics, agricultural production, and other metrics of Japanese society that would have been difficult or impossible for Korean officials to obtain through other means.

The Kanyangnok also contains detailed observations on Japanese government offices, administrative practices, social customs, architectural styles, religious beliefs, and daily life across different social classes. Kang's training as a Neo-Confucian scholar enabled him to provide not merely descriptive accounts but also analytical comparisons between Korean and Japanese societies, always viewed through the lens of Confucian moral philosophy.[^22] His work includes practical information on Japanese military organization, fortification techniques, and naval capabilities—intelligence of immediate tactical value to Korean defense planners.

### Transmission of Neo-Confucianism to Japan

Perhaps equally significant as his written record was Kang Hang's role in transmitting Korean Neo-Confucian scholarship to Japan, particularly through his intellectual relationship with Fujiwara Seika (1561–1619), a former Zen monk who became one of the pioneering figures in Japanese Neo-Confucianism.[^23] During his captivity, Kang engaged in extensive philosophical discussions and written correspondence with Seika, and together they edited Confucian classics based on the Neo-Confucianism of Zhu Xi and the Korean T'oegye school developed by Yi Hwang.[^24]

Fujiwara Seika openly acknowledged that his conversion from Zen Buddhism to Confucianism and his understanding of Neo-Confucian philosophy were significantly influenced by his encounters with Kang Hang and Korean scholarly materials. Seika claimed that the authenticity of his scholarship was supported by his contacts with Korean embassies and, crucially, by his intellectual conversations with Kang Hang.[^25] The written philosophical dialogue between Kang and Seika occupies a prominent place in Seika's collected works, demonstrating the importance of this exchange for the development of Japanese intellectual history.[^26]

The influence extended beyond Seika himself. Fujiwara Seika subsequently had a decisive influence on Hayashi Razan (1583–1657), who established a Neo-Confucian school based on Zhu Xi scholarship and served as an official adviser to the Tokugawa shoguns, helping to establish Neo-Confucianism as the official ideology of the Tokugawa state.[^27] Thus, Kang Hang's captivity created an unexpected conduit through which Korean Neo-Confucian thought flowed into Japan precisely at the moment when the newly established Tokugawa regime was seeking ideological foundations for its political order.

### Cultural Documentation and Identity Formation

Kang Hang's writings also contributed to the articulation of a distinctly Korean cultural identity during a period when such definitions were being tested and refined through conflict with Japan. A Neo-Confucianist with deep knowledge of Chinese philosophy and history, Kang drew sharp distinctions between the Confucian values of his world—which emphasized proper relationships between self, family, king, and country—and what he characterized as a foreign culture that practiced invasion and capture in violation of fundamental moral principles.[^28] His work depicts the emergence of Korean identity defined not merely by geography or ethnicity but by adherence to Confucian moral and cultural standards.

At the same time, Kang's evolving perspective on Japan reveals a more nuanced understanding than simple prejudice. While he initially disdained the Japanese as cultural inferiors and moral violators, his direct experience led him to acknowledge the existence of "good Japanese" and to recognize that behaviors he found objectionable arose from particular institutional structures and cultural practices rather than inherent moral deficiency.[^29] This intellectual evolution, documented in his writings, demonstrates his capacity for analytical observation even under conditions of captivity and emotional distress.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Critique of Korean Military Failures

One of the most striking aspects of the Kanyangnok is Kang Hang's sharp criticism of Korea's own military system and defense preparations, observations that would have been uncomfortable for Korean officials to read. He noted that there was neither systematic recruitment nor effective military training in Chosŏn, leaving the country vulnerable to the kind of professional military forces that Japan had developed during its century of civil wars.[^30] His account of the volunteer militia's rapid dispersal when confronted by Japanese troops implicitly criticized the romantic notion that scholarly virtue and patriotic enthusiasm could substitute for military professionalism and training.

These criticisms, while offered in the service of improving Korean defense capabilities, nonetheless exposed weaknesses that the government might have preferred to minimize or ignore. Kang's willingness to document Korean failures alongside Japanese capabilities demonstrated intellectual honesty but also risked undermining confidence in the existing political and military order. For a Confucian scholar whose ideology emphasized loyalty and harmony, such public criticism required careful framing to avoid accusations of disloyalty or defeatism.

### Cultural Superiority and Prejudice

Despite his eventual recognition of positive qualities among individual Japanese people, Kang Hang's writings are fundamentally grounded in assumptions of Korean cultural superiority. His assessment of Japan consistently stressed its inferiority in comparison to Chosŏn, particularly in the realm of Confucian scholarship and moral cultivation.[^31] From a modern perspective, such attitudes reflect the cultural chauvinism common among educated elites of the period, who viewed civilization as a hierarchy with those closest to Chinese cultural models occupying the highest positions.

Kang's framework for understanding Japan was inevitably limited by his Neo-Confucian worldview, which sometimes prevented him from appreciating Japanese cultural achievements on their own terms. His tendency to measure all cultural practices against Confucian standards meant that distinctively Japanese institutions, aesthetic traditions, and social arrangements were often judged as deficient rather than different. While understandable given his education and the circumstances of his captivity, this perspective has been critiqued by modern scholars as reflecting the limitations of premodern East Asian intellectual frameworks.

### Questions About Collaboration

The very fact of Kang Hang's intellectual exchanges with Japanese scholars during his captivity raised potential questions about the boundaries between intelligence gathering and collaboration with the enemy. While Kang framed his activities as serving Korean interests—acting "in effect as a spy for his king"[^32]—his teaching of Neo-Confucian philosophy to Japanese scholars like Fujiwara Seika could be viewed as providing cultural and ideological resources to Korea's adversary. The fact that these teachings ultimately helped legitimize and stabilize the Tokugawa regime might have been seen by some as problematic, even though Kang could not have foreseen such long-term consequences.

Modern historians debate whether Kang's primary motivation in engaging with Japanese intellectuals was strategic (gathering information and maintaining his safety through useful engagement) or genuinely philosophical (pursuing scholarly exchange regardless of political circumstances). The translators of his work, JaHyun Kim Haboush and Kenneth Robinson, stress that the Kanyangnok was "intended to vindicate the author's loyalty to Chosŏn despite his capture and subsequent captivity in Japan,"[^33] suggesting that questions about his loyalty were indeed a concern that Kang himself felt compelled to address.

### Scholarly Debates on Influence

Some scholars have questioned the extent and nature of Kang Hang's influence on Fujiwara Seika and Japanese Neo-Confucianism more broadly. Skeptical interpretations suggest that Seika's engagement with Kang may have been primarily instrumental—seeking to learn about Confucian practices and representations that would help position himself advantageously in Japan's intellectual marketplace rather than reflecting genuine philosophical transformation through Korean influence.[^34] According to this view, Seika emphasized his connection with Kang Hang as a form of authentication and legitimation for his own scholarly claims rather than as an acknowledgment of substantive intellectual debt.

This debate reflects larger questions about cultural transmission and intellectual influence: To what extent do ideas travel intact across cultural boundaries, and to what extent are they transformed by the receiving context? While Kang certainly transmitted Korean interpretations of Neo-Confucianism to Japan, the resulting Japanese Neo-Confucianism developed distinctive characteristics shaped by Japan's political structure, social organization, and existing intellectual traditions. The relationship between Kang's teachings and the mature forms of Tokugawa Confucianism remains a subject of scholarly investigation and debate.

## Personal Life

### Family in Captivity

Unlike many war captives who were separated from their families and sold into slavery or service, Kang Hang endured his three years of captivity alongside his family members. The sources indicate that "he and his family" were captured together off the coast of Chŏlla Province and remained together throughout their movements from Ōzu to Osaka to Fushimi.[^35] This shared experience of captivity undoubtedly shaped Kang's perspective and priorities during his time in Japan. His role as family patriarch would have added psychological burdens beyond those of captivity itself, as he bore responsibility for the welfare and survival of his dependents in precarious circumstances.

The Kanyangnok contains references to "the frustration of a betrayed escape attempt, and the exhilaration of final liberation,"[^36] suggesting that the family's efforts to return to Korea involved considerable planning, risk, and emotional investment. The fact that they made multiple escape attempts before finally succeeding demonstrates both determination and the significant obstacles they faced. The emotional toll of failed escape attempts, particularly when family members' safety was at stake, must have been considerable, yet Kang managed to continue his scholarly observations and writing throughout this period of sustained stress and uncertainty.

### Personality and Character

Kang Hang's writings reveal a personality characterized by intellectual curiosity, analytical rigor, and strong moral convictions. Even under the difficult circumstances of captivity, he maintained the disciplined habits of a scholar, systematically observing and recording information about his surroundings. His ability to engage productively with Japanese intellectuals despite the context of war and captivity suggests diplomatic skills and a capacity to separate philosophical inquiry from immediate political hostility—or at least to subordinate the latter to the former when strategically advantageous.[^37]

At the same time, Kang's work reveals a man deeply committed to Confucian values and Korean cultural identity. He "broadened his eyesight during his captivity in Japan but preserved his Korean identity and neo-Confucian views and beliefs, viewing himself and his position as a representative of Korean culture who stood on neo-Confucian ground."[^38] This self-conception as a cultural representative gave meaning and purpose to his captivity, transforming what might have been merely a period of suffering into an opportunity for cultural assertion and intelligence gathering.

The metaphor of the shepherd in his title suggests how Kang understood his role: as a guide and protector of his flock (his family and Korean cultural values) in a foreign and potentially hostile environment. This self-image reflects both humility (the shepherd as a servant) and authority (the shepherd as leader and protector), capturing the dual nature of his position as both captive and observer, both victim and documentarian.

### Later Life After Return

The historical record provides limited information about Kang Hang's life following his return to Korea in 1600. He lived until 1618, a period of eighteen years during which Korea was recovering from the devastation of the Imjin War and rebuilding its infrastructure, economy, and administrative systems.[^39] Given the value of his intelligence and his demonstrated loyalty during captivity, it is reasonable to assume that he received recognition from the government and possibly further official appointments, though specific details of his later career remain obscure in available sources.

The compilation and publication of the Kanyangnok in the seventeenth century suggests that Kang's work gained recognition and official sanction, becoming part of Korea's historical and intelligence archives. His status as both a war survivor and a source of valuable information about Japan would have given him unique authority in discussions of Korean-Japanese relations during the decades following the war. Whether he played an active role in diplomatic negotiations or policy formulation regarding Japan, or whether he primarily focused on scholarly pursuits, remains a question for further historical research.

## Legacy

### Historical and Intelligence Value

The most immediate legacy of Kang Hang was the intelligence value of the Kanyangnok for the Korean government. After the war, his writings on Japan and his map of the island country provided Korean government officials and other elites with their newest and most comprehensive information on Japanese society, politics, and military organization.[^40] This information proved valuable not only for understanding Korea's recent adversary but also for navigating the complex diplomatic relationship that developed between Chosŏn Korea and Tokugawa Japan in the seventeenth century, characterized by carefully managed trade and diplomatic missions despite underlying tensions.

The Kanyangnok served as a reference work for Korean diplomats, officials, and scholars for generations, shaping Korean understanding of Japan during a period when direct contact between the two countries was limited and carefully controlled. In an era before modern intelligence agencies and systematic information gathering, firsthand accounts by educated observers like Kang represented irreplaceable sources of knowledge about foreign societies. His work thus contributed to Korean statecraft and foreign policy in practical ways that extended far beyond its literary or philosophical merits.

### Intellectual Bridge Between Korea and Japan

"Today, Kang's importance is understood to lie in the intellectual connections he made with Japan at a time of suspicion and distrust between Chosŏn and Japan."[^41] Modern scholarship has increasingly recognized Kang Hang's role as an intellectual bridge between Korean and Japanese Neo-Confucianism at a formative moment in East Asian intellectual history. His transmission of Korean Neo-Confucian thought to Fujiwara Seika and, indirectly, to the broader development of Tokugawa Confucianism represents a significant, if involuntary, contribution to Japanese intellectual and cultural history.

This cross-cultural intellectual exchange occurred despite—or perhaps because of—the military conflict between the two nations. Kang's captivity created opportunities for sustained interaction with Japanese scholars that would have been unlikely in peacetime, when Korea and Japan had minimal diplomatic or cultural contact. The paradox of war creating conditions for cultural transmission speaks to the complex and often unexpected ways that historical forces shape intellectual development across national boundaries.

The influence of Korean Neo-Confucianism on Japanese thought helped establish ideological common ground that would eventually facilitate diplomatic normalization between the two countries. While Kang could not have foreseen this outcome, his intellectual engagement with Japanese scholars contributed to a shared Confucian cultural framework that, despite significant national and political differences, provided a basis for communication and mutual understanding in subsequent centuries.

### Symbol of Cultural Resilience

Kang Hang has also become a symbol of Korean cultural resilience and identity maintenance under conditions of extreme adversity. His ability to preserve his Korean identity and Confucian values while captive in enemy territory, and to transform his captivity into an opportunity for cultural assertion rather than merely enduring suffering, represents an inspiring narrative of intellectual and moral steadfastness.[^42] In Korean historical memory, he exemplifies the scholar-official who serves his country even under the most difficult circumstances, gathering intelligence, maintaining cultural standards, and ultimately returning to contribute his knowledge to the nation's recovery.

This symbolic dimension of Kang's legacy gained renewed importance during Korea's later experiences of foreign occupation and cultural pressure, particularly during the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945). His example of maintaining Korean identity while under Japanese control, albeit in a very different context and era, provided a historical precedent that could be invoked to encourage cultural resistance and preservation.

### Modern Academic and Literary Significance

The publication in 2013 of a complete, annotated English translation of Kang Hang's writings by JaHyun Kim Haboush and Kenneth R. Robinson through Columbia University Press has brought his work to a global scholarly audience.[^43] Reviewers have praised the translation as "smooth and erudite" with notes "full of useful historical and cultural information," and have called for it to become required reading in courses on Korean history and premodern East Asia.[^44] The translation has been recognized as a potential model for scholarly translation of premodern Korean texts, setting standards for annotation, contextualization, and accessibility.

This renewed scholarly attention has sparked fresh research into Kang Hang's life, work, and influence, as well as broader questions about Korean-Japanese cultural exchange, the impact of the Imjin War on East Asian history, and the role of captivity narratives in shaping cross-cultural understanding. His work now features in academic discussions spanning multiple disciplines, including East Asian history, comparative literature, intellectual history, translation studies, and the history of warfare and diplomacy. The Kanyangnok has thus transcended its original purpose as an intelligence report to become a valuable primary source for understanding late sixteenth-century East Asia from a Korean perspective.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars have offered substantial praise for Kang Hang's achievements and character. The translation editors note that his work represents an invaluable primary source for understanding the Imjin War period and Korean-Japanese relations during a critical juncture in East Asian history. His ability to maintain scholarly objectivity and analytical rigor despite the trauma of captivity demonstrates exceptional intellectual discipline and emotional resilience.[^45]

Historians of Japanese intellectual history acknowledge Kang's significant role in the transmission of Neo-Confucianism to Japan. While debates continue about the precise extent of his influence, there is general agreement that his interactions with Fujiwara Seika represented an important moment in the development of Japanese Confucian thought. Some scholars view him as a crucial link in the chain of intellectual transmission from Chinese and Korean Neo-Confucianism to the distinctive forms of Confucianism that would support and legitimize the Tokugawa political order.[^46]

Korean historians have celebrated Kang Hang as an exemplar of loyal service and cultural preservation under adversity. His documentation of Korean military weaknesses, while potentially embarrassing, has been reinterpreted as valuable self-criticism that contributed to post-war reforms and improvements in Korean defense capabilities. His success in maintaining his family's cohesion and eventually securing their return to Korea demonstrates personal courage and resourcefulness in addition to his scholarly achievements.[^47]

Literary scholars appreciate the Kanyangnok for its vivid descriptions, analytical insights, and the window it provides into the mindset of a Confucian scholar confronting a foreign culture under extreme circumstances. The work is valued both for its factual content and for its literary qualities, including its use of classical Chinese prose styles and its skillful integration of philosophical reflection with practical observation. It represents an important example of premodern Korean prose literature and contributes to understanding the development of Korean intellectual and literary traditions.[^48]

### Negative Views and Criticisms

Critical perspectives on Kang Hang generally focus on the limitations of his worldview rather than questioning his intentions or integrity. His Neo-Confucian framework and assumptions of Korean cultural superiority prevented him from fully appreciating Japanese culture on its own terms, leading to assessments that modern scholars view as culturally biased and intellectually limited. While such attitudes were typical of educated elites of his era, they nonetheless constrain the usefulness of his observations for certain analytical purposes.[^49]

Some scholars question whether Kang's influence on Japanese Neo-Confucianism has been overstated. Skeptics point out that Fujiwara Seika had access to multiple sources of Confucian learning, including Chinese texts and other Korean scholars beyond Kang Hang, making it difficult to isolate Kang's specific contribution. The suggestion that Seika's emphasis on his relationship with Kang was primarily a legitimation strategy rather than an acknowledgment of genuine intellectual transformation represents a more critical interpretation of their interaction.[^50]

From a contemporary ethical perspective, some might question Kang's decision to engage in substantive intellectual exchange with scholars of a nation that had invaded his country and killed hundreds of thousands of his countrymen. While he framed his activities as intelligence gathering in service of Korea, the fact that his teachings helped establish an ideology that stabilized and legitimized Japanese political power could be viewed as problematic. However, such criticisms must be balanced against the recognition that Kang's options as a captive were severely limited and that his engagement may have been necessary for his and his family's survival.

Finally, some historians note that Kang's writings, while valuable, represent only one Korean perspective on Japan and should not be taken as representative of all Korean views or experiences. His status as an educated yangban official gave him access to certain types of information and interactions that would have been unavailable to Korean prisoners from other social classes. The experiences of the tens of thousands of Korean potters, artisans, and commoners who were taken to Japan and often remained there differ dramatically from Kang's relatively privileged captivity and successful return. A complete understanding of the Korean experience in Japan during this period requires attention to multiple voices and perspectives, not solely those of elite scholar-officials like Kang Hang.[^51]
