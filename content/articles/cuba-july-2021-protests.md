## Summary

On July 11, 2021, Cubans did something that hadn't happened in decades: they marched in the streets by the thousands, shouting "Libertad!" and "Patria y Vida"—Homeland and Life—a direct rebuke to the revolution's old slogan "Patria o Muerte" (Homeland or Death). From Havana to Santiago, in over 50 towns and cities, Cubans demanded food, medicine, an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on power, and the resignation of President Miguel Díaz-Canel.[^1]

The protests were the largest anti-government demonstrations Cuba had seen since 1994. They were sparked by COVID-19's devastation of the economy, in addition to decades of accumulated grievances: chronic shortages, repression, and the sense that the revolution had failed its people. Social media—especially the hashtag #SOSCuba—spread images that the state couldn't control. For a moment, it seemed the regime might face its greatest challenge.[^2]

The crackdown was swift and brutal. Over 1,400 people were arrested. Protesters were sentenced to prison terms of up to 25 years for "sedition." At least one person was killed. Internet access was cut. The government mobilized its supporters and accused the United States of orchestrating the unrest. By the end of July, the streets were quiet again. But something had shifted: Cubans had shown they were willing to risk everything to demand change.[^3]

| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1994 Maleconazo        | 1994     | Emigration allowed; regime survived |
| **2021 July protests** | **2021** | **Crackdown; regime survived**      |
| Venezuela 2017         | 2017     | Regime survived                     |
| Nicaragua 2018         | 2018     | Regime survived                     |
