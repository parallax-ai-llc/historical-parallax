## Summary

Pablo Ruiz Picasso (1881-1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, and one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. Co-founder of Cubism, he revolutionized art by abandoning perspective and fragmenting objects into geometric forms. Over his 80-year career, Picasso's prolific output—thousands of paintings, sculptures, prints, ceramics—moved through multiple styles: Blue Period, Rose Period, African Period, Cubism, Classicism, Surrealism. His 1937 masterpiece *Guernica*, responding to the bombing of a Basque town during the Spanish Civil War, became an anti-war icon. Famous for his affairs, his intensity, and his proclamation "Every act of creation is first an act of destruction," Picasso remains the archetype of modern artistic genius.
