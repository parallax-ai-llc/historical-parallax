## Summary

Zarathustra (Zoroaster) was the ancient Iranian prophet who founded Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions. He preached the worship of Ahura Mazda as the supreme deity and the cosmic battle between good (Asha) and evil (Druj). His teachings are preserved in the Gathas, the oldest part of the Avesta. Zoroastrianism was the dominant religion of the Persian empires and profoundly influenced Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
