## Summary

Peter Voulkos was an American artist who revolutionized ceramics by treating clay as an art medium rather than a craft material. His massive, expressionist stacked and torn vessels broke every convention of functional pottery. He is credited with creating the American abstract expressionist ceramics movement and elevating clay to the status of sculpture.
