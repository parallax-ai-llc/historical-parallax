## Summary

Ernest Everett Just was an African-American biologist who made pioneering contributions to understanding cell biology, fertilization, and embryonic development. His research on marine organisms at Woods Hole demonstrated the importance of the cell surface (ectoplasm) in development. Facing racial discrimination in America, he spent much of his later career working in European laboratories. He published over 70 scientific papers and two books.
