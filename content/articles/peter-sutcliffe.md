## Summary
Peter Sutcliffe, the 'Yorkshire Ripper,' murdered 13 women and attempted to murder seven others in northern England between 1975 and 1980. His case prompted one of the largest criminal investigations in British history and led to the Byford Report, which fundamentally reformed police investigation methods.

## Early Life
Born June 2, 1946, in Bingley, Yorkshire. He left school at 15 and worked various jobs including gravedigger, where colleagues noted his fascination with corpses. He married in 1974 and worked as a truck driver, giving him mobility across northern England. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1975 and 1980, Sutcliffe attacked 20 women across Yorkshire and Greater Manchester, killing 13. He used a hammer, screwdriver, and knife. The investigation was hampered by a hoax tape from 'Wearside Jack' (John Humble), which misdirected police. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Arrested January 2, 1981, with a sex worker in Sheffield, officers found a hammer and knife. He confessed to 13 murders and was sentenced to 20 life terms. He died of COVID-19 on November 13, 2020. [^3]
