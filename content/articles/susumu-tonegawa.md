## Summary

Susumu Tonegawa is a Japanese biologist who won the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the genetic mechanism that produces antibody diversity. He showed that genetic material rearranges itself to form a vast array of antibodies, solving a fundamental mystery of immunology. He later turned to neuroscience and made important contributions to understanding memory and brain function.
