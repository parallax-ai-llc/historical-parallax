## Summary
Nicolae Ceaușescu was a Romanian communist politician and dictator who served as the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989. His regime became increasingly repressive and stalinist, maintaining the most extensive internal police force (Securitate) in the Eastern bloc.

## Revolution
He was overthrown in the Romanian Revolution of 1989, the only violent overthrow of a communist government in the Warsaw Pact during that year. He and his wife Elena were tried and executed by firing squad on Christmas Day.
