## Summary

Nicolae Ceaușescu (January 26, 1918 – December 25, 1989) was the General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party from 1965 to 1989 and President of Romania from 1974 until his overthrow and execution in December 1989. Initially seen as a reformer for his independent foreign policy, Ceaușescu became increasingly authoritarian and developed an extensive personality cult. His disastrous economic policies, systematic demolition of villages, anti-birth control policies, and brutal Securitate secret police made Romania one of the Eastern Bloc's most repressive states. The 1989 Romanian Revolution ended his 24-year rule in spectacular fashion: tried and executed by firing squad on Christmas Day 1989.
