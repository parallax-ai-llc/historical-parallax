## Summary

Ramana Maharshi (1879-1950) was one of the most influential Hindu sages and spiritual teachers of the 20th century, renowned for his teachings on self-inquiry and Advaita Vedanta philosophy[^1]. Born as Venkataraman Iyer in Tamil Nadu, he experienced a spontaneous enlightenment at age 16, after which he journeyed to the sacred mountain Arunachala where he remained for 54 years until his death[^2]. His core teaching method of self-inquiry through the question "Who am I?" made ancient Vedantic wisdom accessible to both Eastern and Western seekers[^3]. Through his silent presence and simple teachings, he profoundly influenced modern spirituality, bridging traditional Hindu philosophy with contemporary mindfulness practices[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Ramana Maharshi was born Venkataraman Iyer on December 30, 1879, in the village of Tiruchuzhi (also spelled Tiruchuli) near Aruppukkottai in Tamil Nadu, India[^5]. He was the second of four children born into an orthodox Hindu Brahmin family of the Parashara lineage[^6]. His father, Sundaram Iyer (1848-1890), worked as a court pleader, while his mother, Azhagammal (1864-1922), was known for her generosity and goodness[^7]. The family was well-regarded in their community for their charitable nature, with Sundaram Iyer maintaining an open house for the needy and Alagamma never turning away anyone who needed food[^8].

Venkataraman had two brothers, Nagaswami (1877-1900) and Nagasundaram (1886-1953), along with a younger sister Alamelu (1887-1953)[^9]. The family deity was Sri Venkateswara, and they followed traditional Brahmin customs and practices[^10]. His early childhood was quite normal, joining other children his age in play and activities typical of village life in late 19th century Tamil Nadu[^11].

His early education began at the village school in Tiruchuzhi, where only Tamil was taught, which he attended for three years[^12]. When Venkataraman was about eleven years old, his father sent him to live with his paternal uncle Subbaiyar in Dindigul, desiring that his sons receive an English-language education to qualify them for government service[^13]. This was a common aspiration among Brahmin families of that era, seeking to secure their children's futures in the colonial administrative system.

Tragedy struck the family in February 1892 when Sundaram Iyer died unexpectedly[^14]. Following his father's death, the family was broken up, with Venkataraman and his elder brother going to live with their paternal uncle Subbier in Madurai[^15]. This period marked a significant transition in the young boy's life, moving from the rural environment of Tiruchuzhi to the more cosmopolitan city of Madurai, one of Tamil Nadu's major cultural and religious centers.

In November 1895, a pivotal moment occurred when the teenage Venkataraman heard someone mention "Arunachala," the sacred mountain in Tiruvannamalai[^16]. He was overwhelmed by the realization that Arunachala was a real physical place, not merely a mythological concept he had known of from childhood[^17]. This experience foreshadowed the profound connection he would later develop with the mountain, which he would come to regard as the physical manifestation of the divine and his ultimate guru[^18].

## Rise to Prominence

The transformative event that would define Ramana Maharshi's life occurred in July 1896, when he was just 16 years old[^19]. While alone in his uncle's house in Madurai, he was suddenly overcome by an intense fear of death[^20]. Rather than panicking, the young Venkataraman lay down on the floor and conducted what he later called a "death-experience" experiment[^21]. He systematically examined what would happen if his body died, keeping his limbs stretched out stiff to simulate a corpse[^22].

During this extraordinary experience, he became aware of a "current" or "force" (avesam in Tamil) which he recognized as his true "I" or "self"[^23]. He felt his identity as something entirely separate from his physical body, realizing that the real "I" was imperishable and continued to exist beyond physical death[^24]. This spontaneous awakening brought him into what he later described as "the state of mind of Iswara or the jnani"—a state of enlightenment or self-realization[^25]. In his later years, Ramana called this experience akrama mukti, meaning "sudden liberation"[^26].

Following this profound experience, Venkataraman's interest in his former life evaporated entirely[^27]. He lost all concern for school studies, friends, and family relations, often sitting absorbed in meditation while his family members criticized him for his apparent indifference[^28]. Six weeks after his enlightenment experience, on August 29, 1896, he left his uncle's home in Madurai without informing anyone, leaving behind only a brief note[^29]. He understood that it was the spiritual power of Arunachala that had brought about his self-realization and was now pulling him physically to that sacred place[^30].

After a journey involving both train travel and walking, the young seeker arrived at Tiruvannamalai on September 1, 1896[^31]. Upon reaching the Arunachaleswara Temple at the foot of Arunachala mountain, he immediately discarded his remaining possessions, including his money and even his sacred thread, symbolizing his complete renunciation[^32]. From that day until his death 54 years later in 1950, Ramana never left Arunachala, remaining in its vicinity for his entire adult life[^33].

The early years at Arunachala were marked by intense austerity and deep meditation[^34]. The young sannyasin spent his first weeks in the thousand-pillared hall of the great temple, sitting in deep samadhi, often unaware of the ants and vermin that crawled over his motionless body[^35]. He later moved to various locations around the mountain, including the Patala Lingam shrine, Mango Tree Cave, Pavalakunru, and Skandasramam[^36]. During these years, he maintained near-total silence and was largely unaware of his physical surroundings, absorbed in the depth of his inner realization[^37].

The turning point in Ramana's recognition came in 1907 when Kavyakantha Sri Ganapati Sastri, a renowned Vedic scholar and poet, visited him seeking spiritual guidance[^38]. After receiving instruction on self-enquiry from the young sage, Ganapati Sastri was so profoundly impressed that he prostrated before him and proclaimed him "Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi"—the first time Venkataraman was called by this name that would become famous worldwide[^39]. "Ramana" is a Tamil form of his birth name, while "Maharshi" means "great sage"[^40].

Ramana's first Western devotee was F.H. Humphreys, who came to India in 1911 to take up a post in the Police service at Vellore[^41]. However, Ramana's teachings truly began reaching Western audiences in the 1930s when Paul Brunton published his influential book "A Search in Secret India" in 1934[^42]. Brunton's vivid description of his encounter with the sage brought Ramana Maharshi to international attention, sparking interest among Western seekers of spiritual wisdom[^43]. This marked the beginning of Ramana's global influence, though he himself never traveled beyond Arunachala or actively sought followers[^44].

## Major Achievements

Ramana Maharshi's primary achievement was not in worldly accomplishments but in his embodiment and transmission of the highest teachings of Advaita Vedanta through direct experience rather than scholastic learning[^45]. His original contribution to yogic philosophy was the technique of vichara—self-inquiry or self-investigation—presented in a remarkably accessible and practical form[^46]. While self-inquiry had existed in various forms within Indian spiritual traditions, Ramana Maharshi refined and emphasized it as the most direct path to self-realization, making it available to seekers regardless of their background, education, or religious affiliation[^47].

The cornerstone of his teaching was the practice of asking "Who am I?" (Nan Yar in Tamil)[^48]. This wasn't merely an intellectual question but a profound method of turning attention inward to discover the source of the "I-thought"—the primal sense of individual identity from which all other thoughts arise[^49]. He taught that by persistently inquiring into the nature of the "I," the individual ego would eventually subside, revealing the true Self (Atman), which is identical to the ultimate reality (Brahman)[^50]. As he explained, "If one enquires 'Who am I?' within the mind, the individual 'I' falls down abashed as soon as one reaches the Heart and immediately Reality manifests itself spontaneously as 'I-I'"[^51].

His written works, though relatively few, became foundational texts in modern Vedantic literature[^52]. The most important was "Ulladu Narpadu" (Forty Verses on Reality), composed in Tamil, which systematically presents the essence of his non-dual philosophy[^53]. Another crucial text was "Upadesa Saram" (The Essence of Instruction), a concise summary of spiritual practice in 30 verses[^54]. His work "Nan Yar?" (Who Am I?) emerged from answers he gave to questions posed by devotee Sivaprakasam Pillai and became one of the most widely read introductions to his teachings[^55]. These works are notable for their directness and clarity, stripping away unnecessary complexity to present the essence of self-realization[^56].

Unlike traditional Advaita Vedanta as expounded by Adi Shankara, which emphasized scriptural study and philosophical understanding, Ramana Maharshi emphasized personal experience of self-realization over philosophical argumentation[^57]. Arvind Sharma, a scholar of comparative religion, qualifies Ramana as the chief exponent of "experiential Advaita" to distinguish his approach from Shankara's classical doctrinal Advaita[^58]. This democratization of Vedantic wisdom—making it accessible without requiring years of scriptural study or the guidance of traditional methods—represents one of his most significant contributions to modern spirituality[^59].

Ramana's ashram, Sri Ramanasramam, which grew organically around him, became a major spiritual center attracting thousands of seekers from across India and around the world[^60]. What distinguished this ashram from many others was its complete lack of formal organization or hierarchy during Ramana's lifetime[^61]. He accepted all who came regardless of caste, religion, nationality, or social status at a time when such egalitarianism was revolutionary in orthodox Hindu society[^62]. The ashram operated on principles of simplicity and self-sufficiency, with Ramana himself participating in daily activities such as cooking, cutting vegetables, and even stitching leaf plates[^63].

His method of teaching was often through silence rather than lengthy discourses[^64]. Devotees and visitors would sit in his presence, and many reported experiencing profound inner transformation simply through this silent communion[^65]. When he did speak or write responses to questions, his answers were characterized by absolute clarity and directness, cutting through conceptual complexity to point directly to the truth of non-dual awareness[^66]. This teaching through presence, or "transmission of silence" (mouna diksha), became one of his most celebrated characteristics[^67].

Ramana successfully bridged Eastern and Western spiritual traditions without compromising the integrity of either[^68]. He welcomed Western seekers and engaged thoughtfully with their questions, while remaining firmly rooted in the Hindu contemplative tradition[^69]. His influence extended to prominent Western religious thinkers and spiritual teachers, including Thomas Merton, Bede Griffiths, Henri Le Saux (Swami Abhishiktanananda), and later figures like Eckhart Tolle and Ken Wilber[^70]. In the 1960s, disciples like Bhagawat Singh actively spread Ramana Maharshi's teachings in the United States, furthering his global reach[^71].

His approach to spirituality emphasized that self-realization was not the exclusive domain of renunciates or monks but was available to householders living ordinary lives[^72]. He taught that formal renunciation of the world was not necessary; what mattered was inner renunciation of the ego-sense[^73]. This teaching made spiritual practice accessible to people in all walks of life, contributing to the modern integration of contemplative practices into daily living[^74].

Perhaps his greatest achievement was living as a embodiment of his teachings until his final breath[^75]. Even when afflicted with the sarcoma that would eventually claim his life, he remained peaceful and composed, demonstrating that the Self he taught about was truly beyond the body and its suffering[^76]. When devotees expressed anguish about his impending death, he reassured them saying, "Where could I go? I am here"[^77]—pointing to the eternal nature of the Self that transcends physical existence[^78].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his widespread veneration, Ramana Maharshi was not without critics and controversies, both during his lifetime and in scholarly retrospectives[^79]. One significant area of criticism concerned social issues, particularly caste observance at his ashram[^80]. Although Ramana personally treated all visitors equally regardless of caste or background, caste was observed in the ashram dining room, with Brahmins seated separately[^81]. According to some accounts, Ramana insisted on maintaining this separation, which contradicted the universal accessibility of his spiritual teachings and disappointed some followers who expected complete social egalitarianism[^82].

His apparent political indifference also drew criticism[^83]. During World War II, when the world was convulsed by conflict, Ramana seemed largely unconcerned with these events[^84]. Some critics have characterized this as a troubling detachment from human suffering, while supporters argue it reflected his teaching that ultimate reality transcends worldly events[^85]. More controversially, there have been claims that he expressed some approval of Hitler, though these appear to be exaggerations or misunderstandings of his philosophical position on the nature of action and karma[^86]. These allegations remain contentious and poorly documented[^87].

From a religious standpoint, Ramana faced criticism from other Hindu spiritual leaders, most notably from A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON)[^88]. Prabhupada claimed that Ramana "preached" what he called a "nonsense philosophy" and referred to his teachings as "foolish"[^89]. These criticisms stemmed from fundamental theological differences between Ramana's non-dualistic Advaita Vedanta and Prabhupada's devotional Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which emphasizes a personal God and the eternal distinction between the individual soul and the Supreme[^90]. Scholars and devotees of Ramana have characterized Prabhupada's criticisms as unwarranted and based on misunderstanding or misrepresentation of Ramana's actual teachings[^91].

Western observers also raised concerns and criticisms[^92]. Paul Brunton, who had initially been instrumental in introducing Ramana to Western audiences, later expressed criticisms of the sage[^93]. One of Brunton's main objections was that Ramana did not believe in a personal God, which troubled Brunton's own evolving spiritual philosophy[^94]. Brunton also criticized certain events and behaviors within the ashram's management, though he later expressed deep regret for these criticisms, stating they were occasioned more by events in the ashram's history than by Ramana himself[^95].

The renowned psychologist Carl Jung held skeptical views about Ramana Maharshi that some devotees found objectionable[^96]. Jung declined to visit Ramana when in India, and in his introduction to Heinrich Zimmer's book on Indian philosophy, Jung included passages that were critical of the Maharshi's approach[^97]. Jung's concerns seemed to center on whether Ramana's teachings were psychologically healthy or represented a form of dissociation from reality[^98]. However, Jung's criticisms were based on limited information and reflected his own psychological framework rather than direct knowledge of Ramana's teachings[^99].

Scholarly criticism has focused on the influence of Western Orientalism on perceptions of Ramana Maharshi[^100]. Critical scholars like Friesen have examined how religious biases from biographers distorted accounts of Ramana, questioning the credibility of even contemporary accounts written while he was still alive[^101]. These scholars argue that Western seekers and writers projected their own spiritual fantasies onto Ramana, creating a romanticized image that may not accurately reflect the historical reality[^102]. The concern is that scholarship has failed to recognize Orientalist stereotypes and maintain critical distance from devotional literature, thus perpetuating potentially inaccurate narratives[^103].

Some critics have questioned the practical applicability of his teachings, arguing that the path of self-inquiry is too abstract or difficult for most people to follow successfully[^104]. The "Ramana Maharshi model for humanity" has been characterized by some as flawed because it seems to require extraordinary inner capacities or circumstances that most people don't possess[^105]. Critics argue that while his realization may have been authentic, the expectation that others can replicate his experience through self-inquiry alone may be unrealistic[^106].

Additionally, there were criticisms regarding his approach to social engagement and service[^107]. Unlike other spiritual leaders who actively worked to alleviate social suffering or reform unjust systems, Ramana's teaching emphasized inner transformation over outer action[^108]. Some critics viewed this as a form of privileged escapism that ignored the urgent material needs of suffering humanity[^109]. While his supporters counter that inner transformation is the foundation for all genuine outer change, this tension between contemplative withdrawal and active engagement remains a point of philosophical debate[^110].

## Personal Life

Ramana Maharshi's personal life was characterized by extraordinary simplicity, humility, and accessibility[^111]. After his spontaneous enlightenment at age 16, he lived as a renunciate, never marrying or maintaining family relationships in the conventional sense[^112]. However, his relationship with his mother, Azhagammal, underwent a profound transformation that became central to his later years[^113].

In 1916, when Ramana was living in Skandasramam on the slopes of Arunachala, his mother and younger brother Nagasundaram joined him at Tiruvannamalai[^114]. His mother, by then a widow, took up the life of a sannyasin herself and assumed responsibility for the ashram kitchen[^115]. She lived near her son for the final six years of her life, undergoing spiritual transformation under his guidance[^116]. When she fell seriously ill in 1922, Ramana attended to her constantly, and witnesses reported that he kept his hand on her heart and head, guiding her through the death process[^117]. Her death and burial at the foot of Arunachala marked the beginning of the present Sri Ramanasramam, as Ramana moved down from the mountain to the site of her samadhi, where the main ashram was subsequently built[^118].

Ramana's daily life at the ashram was remarkably unpretentious[^119]. Unlike many spiritual leaders who maintained distance from mundane activities, he participated fully in ashram work[^120]. He could often be found in the kitchen cutting vegetables, cooking, or in the dining hall stitching leaves together to make plates[^121]. He mended his own clothes and insisted on the same simple lifestyle he asked of others[^122]. Visitors were frequently surprised to find this renowned sage engaged in ordinary tasks, embodying his teaching that self-realization doesn't require withdrawal from normal activities[^123].

His personality was characterized by gentleness, humor, and compassion[^124]. Numerous accounts describe his infectious laugh and his enjoyment of simple pleasures[^125]. He loved animals and showed particular affection for the ashram's dogs, cows, and other creatures, treating them with the same respect he showed human visitors[^126]. The famous story of Lakshmi the cow, who lived at the ashram and was treated by Ramana as a spiritual being deserving of dignity, illustrates his recognition of consciousness in all living beings[^127].

Ramana's health remained generally good until his late sixties[^128]. In November 1948, a small nodule was discovered on his left arm, which was diagnosed as sarcoma[^129]. Despite multiple surgeries—operations were performed in February 1949, August 1949, and December 1949—the cancer continued to spread[^130]. Throughout this painful illness, Ramana maintained his equanimity and continued to give darshan to visitors, refusing to turn anyone away[^131]. When doctors suggested amputation of his arm, he declined, saying the body would soon be gone anyway[^132].

His response to his illness demonstrated the reality of his teachings[^133]. He showed no fear of death and minimal concern for his physical suffering, maintaining that he was not the body and therefore not truly affected by its condition[^134]. When devotees wept at his impending death, he gently reminded them, "They say I am dying, but I am not going away. Where could I go? I am here"[^135]. This statement encapsulated his teaching that the true Self is eternal and unchanging, unaffected by the birth and death of the physical form[^136].

Ramana's eating habits were simple and vegetarian[^137]. He ate the same food served to everyone in the ashram and often ate last, after ensuring all others had been fed[^138]. He maintained no special diet or privileges, embodying the principle of equality he taught[^139]. His sleeping arrangements were equally simple—he slept in the hall where he spent his days, on a simple couch, maintaining no private quarters until his final illness required it[^140].

His relationships with devotees were characterized by deep compassion combined with complete non-attachment[^141]. He showed genuine interest in people's lives and problems but never encouraged dependency or personality cult[^142]. When asked about his role, he consistently downplayed any special status, describing himself simply as one who had realized what everyone truly is[^143]. He maintained that he was not doing anything—that grace worked through him, but the "he" was not the doer[^144].

On April 14, 1950, at 8:47 p.m., Ramana Maharshi took his last breath[^145]. According to witnesses, at that precise moment, a brilliant meteor-like light moved slowly across the sky, passed over the summit of Arunachala, and disappeared behind the mountain[^146]. Thousands of people witnessed this phenomenon, which devotees interpreted as a cosmic confirmation of the sage's spiritual magnitude[^147]. He was 70 years old and had spent 54 years at Arunachala, fulfilling his statement that he could never leave the sacred mountain he considered to be the physical form of his guru[^148].

## Legacy

Ramana Maharshi's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, profoundly influencing modern spirituality across both Eastern and Western traditions[^149]. His teachings continue to thrive as they are examined and embraced within various spiritual movements, underscoring the universality and timelessness of his message[^150]. The ashram he left behind, Sri Ramanasramam in Tiruvannamalai, remains a vibrant spiritual center, attracting thousands of seekers annually from around the world[^151].

His impact on Western spirituality has been particularly significant[^152]. The publication of Paul Brunton's "A Search in Secret India" in 1934 first brought Ramana's teachings to Western audiences, sparking a wave of interest that has never subsided[^153]. This was followed by numerous books, translations, and commentaries that have made his works available to global audiences[^154]. In the 1960s, teachers like Bhagawat Singh actively spread Ramana's teachings in the United States, establishing centers dedicated to his approach[^155].

Ramana Maharshi became a foundational figure in the Neo-Advaita movement, which emerged in the West during the late 20th century[^156]. This movement, largely through students of H.W.L. Poonja (who himself was a devotee of Ramana), has made non-dual teachings a significant component of popular Western spirituality[^157]. Teachers like Eckhart Tolle, though not formally connected to the Ramana lineage, acknowledge the influence of his teachings on their own approach to spiritual awakening[^158].

His influence on Western religious thinkers has been profound and diverse[^159]. The Benedictine monk Bede Griffiths spent years in India and was deeply influenced by Ramana's non-dual teachings, attempting to find common ground between Christian mysticism and Advaita Vedanta[^160]. Henri Le Saux (Swami Abhishiktananda), another Christian monk, underwent a profound spiritual crisis and transformation through his encounter with Ramana's teachings, dedicating his life to exploring the intersection of Christian and Hindu contemplative paths[^161]. The Trappist monk Thomas Merton expressed deep appreciation for Ramana's approach to contemplation[^162]. Contemporary figures like Francis X. Clooney, Georg Feuerstein, Andrew Harvey, and Ken Wilber have all acknowledged Ramana's influence on their work[^163].

The practice of self-inquiry that Ramana refined and emphasized has become integrated into modern mindfulness and therapeutic practices[^164]. His method of turning attention inward and investigating the source of thoughts has influenced contemporary approaches to meditation, psychology, and even neuroscience research into consciousness[^165]. Many modern meditation teachers incorporate self-inquiry techniques similar to those Ramana taught, often without explicitly acknowledging the source[^166].

His approach made spiritual wisdom accessible without requiring adherence to specific religions or traditions[^167]. This universality has proven particularly appealing in the pluralistic context of modern spirituality, where seekers often resist institutional religious structures while remaining hungry for authentic spiritual experience[^168]. Ramana's teaching that self-realization is available to anyone, regardless of background, education, or formal religious practice, resonated with this contemporary spiritual orientation[^169].

The body of literature about Ramana and his teachings continues to grow[^170]. Besides his own written works, numerous accounts by devotees, scholarly analyses, and contemporary interpretations ensure his teachings remain accessible to new generations[^171]. Publishers worldwide continue to release new editions, translations, and commentaries on his works[^172]. Digital platforms and online communities have further extended his reach, with websites, YouTube channels, and social media groups dedicated to discussing and practicing his teachings[^173].

Organizations dedicated to preserving and disseminating Ramana's teachings operate globally[^174]. Besides the main ashram in Tiruvannamalai, ashrams and centers inspired by his teachings exist in North America, Europe, Australia, and other parts of Asia[^175]. The Ramana Maharshi Foundation and similar organizations work to maintain the authenticity of his teachings while making them available through publications, retreats, and digital media[^176].

His legacy in academic circles is also significant[^177]. Scholars of comparative religion, Indian philosophy, and consciousness studies regularly engage with his teachings and the questions they raise about the nature of self, consciousness, and reality[^178]. His life and teachings have been the subject of numerous doctoral dissertations, academic papers, and scholarly books examining his contribution to Hindu philosophy and global spirituality[^179].

Perhaps most importantly, Ramana's legacy lives on in the countless individuals whose lives have been transformed through his teachings[^180]. From householders to renunciates, from Western seekers to traditional Hindu devotees, people across the spectrum of human experience report profound benefits from practicing self-inquiry and contemplating his words[^181]. His teaching that "the Self is always realized" offers hope that awakening is not a distant goal requiring superhuman effort, but a present reality awaiting recognition[^182].

His emphasis on the guru as the Self within, rather than an external authority, has influenced how modern seekers approach the student-teacher relationship in spiritual life[^183]. While maintaining respect for the guru principle, Ramana consistently pointed seekers back to their own direct experience, discouraging dependency and encouraging self-reliance in spiritual practice[^184]. This approach has helped many avoid the pitfalls of guru worship while still benefiting from wise guidance[^185].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Ramana Maharshi is widely regarded by scholars and practitioners of Advaita Vedanta as one of the most authentic sages of modern times, embodying the highest realization of Hindu non-dual philosophy[^186]. Academic scholars of Indian philosophy have praised his unique contribution of making Advaita accessible through direct experience rather than complex scholastic study[^187]. Arvind Sharma, a prominent scholar of comparative religion, distinguished Ramana as the chief exponent of "experiential Advaita," recognizing his innovation in emphasizing personal realization over doctrinal understanding[^188].

Western scholars and religious figures have consistently praised his authenticity and the depth of his realization[^189]. Paul Brunton, despite his later criticisms, initially wrote with tremendous admiration about Ramana's spiritual stature, describing him as living proof that enlightenment was not merely a theoretical concept but a living reality[^190]. Carl Jung, though skeptical about some aspects, acknowledged in private correspondence that Ramana was "absorbed in the self" and represented an authentic realization of Indian spiritual ideals[^191].

The Swiss-French writer and monk Henri Le Saux (Swami Abhishiktananda) considered his encounter with Ramana's teachings to be the most significant spiritual event of his life[^192]. He wrote extensively about how Ramana's silent presence and teaching of non-duality challenged and ultimately transformed his understanding of Christian mysticism[^193]. Bede Griffiths, another Christian monk deeply engaged with Hindu spirituality, regarded Ramana as a genuine Christ-figure in the Hindu context, embodying universal spiritual truths beyond religious boundaries[^194].

Contemporary spiritual teachers frequently cite Ramana as a major influence[^195]. Eckhart Tolle has acknowledged that reading about Ramana confirmed his own awakening experience and provided a framework for understanding it[^196]. Countless others in the modern non-dual teaching community trace their lineage or inspiration back to Ramana, either directly through H.W.L. Poonja and his students, or indirectly through encounter with his teachings in books and recordings[^197].

Scholars appreciate his contribution to making ancient wisdom relevant to modern seekers[^198]. His teaching method required no belief in particular doctrines, no complex rituals, and no years of preliminary study—just sincere inquiry into one's own nature[^199]. This democratization of spiritual wisdom is seen as one of his most significant contributions, making the highest teachings accessible to people in all walks of life[^200].

His personal character and the example of his life receive consistent praise from those who knew him and those who have studied his biography[^201]. The consistency between his teaching and his life, his genuine humility, his compassion for all beings, and his complete lack of self-aggrandizement are frequently cited as evidence of authentic realization[^202]. Even critics of his philosophy often acknowledge the purity of his character and the sincerity of his spiritual attainment[^203].

### Negative Views

Critical scholars have raised important questions about the hagiographic nature of much literature about Ramana, suggesting that Western Orientalism and devotional bias have created an idealized image that may not fully accord with historical reality[^204]. Scholar J.F. Friesen has examined how religious presuppositions from biographers potentially distorted accounts, questioning whether even contemporary sources can be fully trusted[^205]. This scholarly skepticism argues that the Ramana presented in popular literature may be more a projection of seekers' spiritual aspirations than an accurate historical portrait[^206].

From a theological perspective, devotional traditions within Hinduism that emphasize a personal God and bhakti (devotional worship) have been critical of Ramana's non-dualistic approach[^207]. As mentioned previously, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada dismissed his teachings as "nonsense philosophy," reflecting a fundamental disagreement about the ultimate nature of reality and the relationship between the individual soul and God[^208]. For devotional traditions, Ramana's teaching that the individual self and ultimate reality are identical represents a dangerous philosophical error that undermines proper worship and devotion[^209].

Some critics have argued that Ramana's teaching, while perhaps authentic for him, represents an unattainable ideal for most people[^210]. The criticism is that his spontaneous enlightenment at age 16, without prior spiritual practice, indicates he was an exceptional case whose path cannot be replicated through the practice he taught[^211]. Critics contend that promoting self-inquiry as a universal path sets up unrealistic expectations and potential disappointment for sincere seekers who may practice for years without experiencing the breakthrough Ramana described[^212].

His apparent social and political indifference has drawn criticism from those who believe spiritual teachers should actively engage with social justice and the alleviation of suffering[^213]. The fact that caste distinctions were maintained in the ashram dining hall, despite his personal non-discrimination, has been cited as a failure to use his influence to challenge unjust social structures[^214]. Some critics view his inward focus as a form of privileged escapism that ignores the urgent material needs of suffering humanity[^215].

Psychological critiques, influenced by Western psychology, have questioned whether Ramana's path represents genuine integration or a form of dissociation[^216]. Some psychologists have wondered whether the complete identification with pure consciousness and disidentification with the body-mind represents a healthy psychological state or a subtle form of depersonalization[^217]. These criticisms, while generally not accepted by those familiar with contemplative traditions, raise questions about the relationship between spiritual realization and psychological health[^218].

Feminist scholars have noted the absence of engagement with gender issues in Ramana's teaching and the patriarchal structures of the ashram environment[^219]. While he personally treated women with respect and accepted female devotees equally, there was no explicit critique of the gender hierarchies prevalent in Indian society, and women's experiences and perspectives were not particularly centered in his teaching[^220]. This criticism reflects contemporary concerns about whether traditional spiritual teachings adequately address issues of gender equity and women's empowerment[^221].
