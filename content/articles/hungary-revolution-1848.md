## Summary

On March 15, 1848, a young poet named Sándor Petőfi stood on the steps of the National Museum in Pest and recited his poem "National Song" to an assembled crowd. "Rise, Hungarians, your country calls!" he declared. By day's end, the printing presses were free, political prisoners were released, and the Habsburg governor had capitulated to every demand. Hungary's revolution had begun.[^1]

The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 was part of the "Spring of Nations"—the wave of revolutions that swept across Europe that year. But while the French, German, and Italian revolutions collapsed, Hungary fought on. What began as a reform movement became a war of independence against the Habsburg Empire. For fifteen months, Hungarian armies—many led by former imperial officers—held their own against Austria. Only Russian intervention, with 200,000 troops, finally crushed them.[^2]

The leader who emerged was Lajos Kossuth, a lawyer and journalist whose oratory inspired a nation. When Austria rejected Hungary's constitution, Kossuth declared Hungary independent and the Habsburgs deposed. It was too much, too fast. The revolution was drowned in blood, its leaders executed or exiled. But March 15 became Hungary's national day, and Kossuth became the symbol of Hungarian freedom—a cause that would not die for another seven decades, until Habsburg rule ended in 1918.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Hungary Under the Habsburgs

**The Kingdom of Hungary:**

- Part of Habsburg dominions since 1526
- Retained its own Diet (parliament) and constitution
- Separate kingdom, not an Austrian province
- But increasingly subordinated to Vienna

**By the 1840s:**

- Hungarian national consciousness growing
- Language movement: Hungarian vs. German
- Reform movement in Diet
- Young radicals pushing further

**The system:**

- Feudal; serfdom still existed
- Nobility dominated politics
- Peasants had few rights
- Growing middle class wanted change[^4]

### The European Context

**1848: Year of Revolutions:**

- February: Revolution in France; Louis Philippe abdicated
- March: Uprisings across German states, Italian states
- Habsburg Empire: Vienna, Prague, Budapest all saw revolution
- "Spring of Nations"—liberals and nationalists rising

**Hungary watched and acted.**[^5]

## The Revolution

### March 15, 1848

**The Twelve Points:**

5. National Guard
6. Taxes shared equally
7. Abolition of serfdom
8. Jury trials

  - Hungary controlled its own finances and army

**Ferdinand signed them.** Hungary had its constitution.[^7]

### Rising Tensions

**Summer 1848:**

- Austria initially accepted Hungary's new status
- But problems emerged:
  - Non-Hungarian nationalities (Croats, Romanians, Slovaks, Serbs) resented Hungarian dominance
  - Austria regained control in Italy and Vienna
  - Conservative forces regrouped

**Croatian invasion:**

- **Josip Jelačić**, Ban of Croatia, refused to recognize Hungarian government

**The die was cast.** War was coming.[^8]

### War of Independence

**December 2, 1848:**

**This was the high point.**[^9]

### Russian Intervention

- **200,000 Russian troops** entered Hungary from the east
- 80,000 more auxiliary forces
- Hungarians outnumbered, outgunned
- Fighting on two fronts (Austria from west, Russia from east)

## Aftermath

### Immediate Repression

**"Bach Era" (1849-1860):**

- Hungary under martial law
- Constitution suspended
- German as official language
- Centralized from Vienna
- Political repression

**Kossuth in exile:**

- Fled to Ottoman Empire
- Later to Britain, Italy, United States
- Continued advocating for Hungarian independence
- Died in exile (Turin, 1894)[^12]

### Long-Term Impact

**The Compromise of 1867:**

- Austria weakened by defeats (Italy, Prussia)
- Negotiated with Hungarians
- **Austro-Hungarian Compromise:** Dual Monarchy
- Hungary regained autonomy within empire
- Franz Joseph crowned King of Hungary

**What the revolution achieved (eventually):**

- Serfdom remained abolished
- Hungarian autonomy restored
- Constitutional government
- Foundation for modern Hungary

### Why Did It Fail?

**Factors:**

1. **Russian intervention:** 200,000 troops overwhelming
2. **Ethnic minorities:** Croats, Romanians, Serbs fought Hungarians
3. **Diplomatic isolation:** No foreign support
4. **Internal divisions:** Kossuth vs. Görgei disagreements
5. **Economic strain:** Couldn't sustain long war[^13]

## Historical Assessment

### Significance

**For Hungary:**

- March 15 is national day
- 1848 became foundational myth
- Petőfi and Kossuth are national heroes
- "Freedom or death" spirit

**For Europe:**

- Longest-lasting 1848 revolution
- Only one requiring external intervention to crush
- Showed power of nationalism

### Comparison to Other 1848 Revolutions

| Country          | Duration                   | Outcome                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| France           | February-June 1848         | Republic, then Louis Napoleon        |
| Prussia          | March 1848-1849            | Failed; constitution revoked         |
| Austria (Vienna) | March-October 1848         | Crushed                              |
| **Hungary**      | **March 1848-August 1849** | **17 months; required Russian army** |

**Hungary fought longest and hardest.**[^14]
