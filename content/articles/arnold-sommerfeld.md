## Summary

Arnold Sommerfeld was a German theoretical physicist who made major contributions to atomic and quantum physics. He extended Bohr's model of the atom with elliptical orbits and introduced the fine-structure constant. More Nobel laureates studied under him than any other physicist (seven), including Heisenberg, Pauli, Debye, and Bethe. Despite being nominated 84 times, he never won the Nobel Prize.
