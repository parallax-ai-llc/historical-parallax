## Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic on April 15, 1912, is the most famous maritime disaster in history. The British luxury liner, deemed "unsinkable" and the largest ship afloat, struck an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Within less than three hours, the Titanic broke apart and sank, killing more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew aboard. The disaster exposed fatal flaws in maritime safety regulations, led to creation of the International Ice Patrol and stricter lifeboat requirements, and became an enduring symbol of hubris meeting tragedy.

## The Ship

### "The Unsinkable Ship"

**Construction:**
- Built by Harland and Wolff shipyard, Belfast, Ireland
- Owner: White Star Line
- Cost: $7.5 million (1912 dollars; ~$200 million today)

**Specifications:**
- Length: 882 feet (269 meters)
- Width: 92 feet (28 meters)
- Gross tonnage: 46,328 tons
- Capacity: 2,435 passengers, 892 crew
- Top speed: 23 knots (43 km/h)

**Luxury:**
- First-class facilities rivaled finest hotels
- Grand staircase, swimming pool, gymnasium
- Turkish bath, squash court
- À la carte restaurant

**Safety Features:**
- 16 watertight compartments (could float with 4 flooded)
- Double bottom
- Marketing claimed "practically unsinkable"—press shortened to "unsinkable"

**Fatal Flaw:**
Only 20 lifeboats (capacity: 1,178)—enough for only half those aboard. Legally compliant, but woefully inadequate.

## The Voyage

### Maiden Voyage

**Departure:** April 10, 1912, Southampton, England
**Stops:** Cherbourg (France), Queenstown (Ireland)
**Destination:** New York City
**Captain:** Edward J. Smith (63, veteran captain, final voyage before retirement)

### Passengers

**Social Mix:**
- First class: Millionaires, aristocrats, celebrities (John Jacob Astor IV, Benjamin Guggenheim, Isidor Straus)
- Second class: Middle-class travelers, professionals
- Third class (steerage): Immigrants seeking new life in America

## The Iceberg

### April 14, 1912

**Warnings:**
Titanic received at least six ice warnings from other ships throughout the day. Captain Smith adjusted course slightly but maintained high speed (22.5 knots) to make a good impression on maiden voyage.

**11:40 PM:**
Lookout Frederick Fleet spotted iceberg directly ahead.

> "Iceberg, right ahead!"

**Collision:**
First Officer Murdoch ordered "hard a-starboard" and engines reversed. Too late. Starboard (right) side scraped iceberg below waterline.

**Damage:**
- 300 feet of hull breached
- First five compartments flooded
- Designed to survive 4 flooded compartments, not 5
- Sinking inevitable

## The Sinking

### Timeline

**11:40 PM:** Collision with iceberg

**12:05 AM (April 15):** Captain Smith orders lifeboats uncovered. Distress signals sent (CQD and SOS).

**12:25 AM:** Lifeboat loading begins. "Women and children first."

**12:45 AM - 2:05 AM:** Lifeboats launched—many only half-full. Confusion, disbelief, reluctance to leave "unsinkable" ship.

**2:18 AM:** Lights fail. Ship breaks in two between third and fourth funnels.

**2:20 AM:** Titanic sinks completely. Bow section plunges; stern follows.

### Chaos and Heroism

**Half-Empty Lifeboats:**
Many boats launched with empty seats due to:
- Officers feared lowering full boats would collapse davits
- Many passengers didn't believe ship was sinking
- Class barriers restricted access

**Band Played On:**
Ship's band continued playing on deck to calm passengers. All eight musicians died.

**Engineers:**
Engine crew stayed below to keep lights and power running as long as possible. All died.

**Notable Deaths:**
- Captain Edward Smith (went down with ship)
- Thomas Andrews (ship designer; helped evacuate)
- John Jacob Astor IV (richest man aboard)
- Benjamin Guggenheim (dressed in finest clothes to die "like a gentleman")
- Isidor and Ida Straus (refused to be separated; died together)

## Rescue

### RMS Carpathia

**Captain Arthur Rostron:**
Upon receiving distress signal, Carpathia raced 58 miles at maximum speed through ice field.

**4:00 AM:**
Reached scene. Rescued 710 survivors from lifeboats.

**8:30 AM:**
Last lifeboat recovered. Carpathia proceeded to New York.

### Search for Bodies

Over following weeks, ships recovered 337 bodies. Many buried at sea. 150 brought to Halifax, Nova Scotia.

## Aftermath

### Public Reaction

**Shock:**
World stunned that technology had failed so catastrophically. Faith in "unsinkable" engineering shattered.

**Inquiries:**
- U.S. Senate inquiry (April-May 1912)
- British Board of Trade inquiry (May-July 1912)

### Maritime Safety Reforms

**SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) 1914:**
- Lifeboats for all passengers
- 24-hour radio watch
- Lifeboat drills
- Ship design improvements

**International Ice Patrol:**
Coast Guard patrol of North Atlantic ice—continues today.

## Discovery

**Condition:**
Ship broken in two. Bow section relatively intact; stern destroyed. Debris field between.

**Artifacts:**
Thousands recovered and displayed. Controversy over disturbing grave site.
