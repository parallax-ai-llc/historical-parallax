## Summary

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was a French Jesuit priest, paleontologist, and philosopher who attempted to reconcile Christianity with evolutionary science. His concept of the 'Omega Point' — the ultimate goal of evolution toward greater consciousness and unity in God — was revolutionary. His major works, including The Phenomenon of Man and The Divine Milieu, were published posthumously because the Vatican suppressed them during his lifetime. His ideas on evolution and spirituality continue to influence science-religion dialogue.
