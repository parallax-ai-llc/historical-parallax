## Summary

Albert Sabin was a Polish-American medical researcher who developed the oral polio vaccine (OPV), which became the dominant vaccine used worldwide to combat poliomyelitis. Unlike Salk's injected vaccine, Sabin's oral vaccine used weakened live virus and could be administered without needles. He never patented his vaccine, donating it to save as many lives as possible. The oral vaccine was crucial to the near-eradication of polio globally.
