## Summary

Hyeonjong (born March 14, 1641; died September 17, 1674) was the 18th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1659 to 1674.[^1] He was unique for being the first and only Joseon king born outside of Korea, having been born in **Shenyang** while his father, King Hyojong, was a political hostage of the Qing Dynasty. His reign was dominated by the intense **Yesong Controversy** (Ritual Dispute), a fierce ideological battle between the Western and Southern factions over funeral rites. Although often overshadowed by this political strife, Hyeonjong managed to navigate the conflict without bloody purges and focused on stabilizing the nation after decades of war.[^2]

## Born in Exile

Hyeonjong was born as **Yi Yeon** in Shenyang, China.
*   **Hostage Life:** He spent his early childhood as a hostage of the Qing Dynasty, returning to Joseon only when his father was released in 1645. This upbringing gave him a cautious and pragmatic outlook.[^3]

## The Yesong Controversy (Ritual Dispute)

Hyeonjong's reign is synonymous with the **Yesong Controversy**, seemingly trivial debates about funeral clothes that masked a deep power struggle.
*   **First Dispute (Gihae Yesong, 1659):** When his father Hyojong died, the controversy erupted over how long the Queen Dowager (King Injo's second wife) should wear mourning clothes.
    *   **Westerners (Seoin):** Argued for 1 year, viewing Hyojong as a "second son" (since his older brother Sohyeon had died). This implied Hyojong's legitimacy was lesser.
    *   **Southerners (Namin):** Argued for 3 years, treating him as the legitimate heir.
    *   **Result:** Hyeonjong sided with the Westerners (1 year) to maintain stability.[^4]
*   **Second Dispute (Gabo Yesong, 1674):** When his mother Queen Inseon died, the debate reignited.
    *   **Result:** This time, Hyeonjong sided with the Southerners, angered by the Westerners' disrespect towards the royal line. The Westerners were purged from power just before Hyeonjong's death.[^5]

## Crisis and Management

*   **Kyungshin Great Famine (1670–1671):** A catastrophic famine struck the nation, killing an estimated 1 million people due to starvation and epidemics. Hyeonjong worked tirelessly to provide relief aid, halting construction projects and using royal funds.[^6]
*   **Achievements:** Despite the chaos, he banned the marriage of people with the same surname (Dongseong Dongbon), improved moveable type for printing (Hwalgija), and rebuilt the finances of the military.[^7]
