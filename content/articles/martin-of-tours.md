## Summary

Martin of Tours was a Roman soldier who became a monk, then Bishop of Tours, and is one of the most popular saints in Western Christianity. He is famous for cutting his military cloak in half to share with a beggar, after which he saw Christ wearing the cloak in a vision. He pioneered rural evangelization in Gaul and established some of the first monasteries in the West. His shrine at Tours became one of the major pilgrimage sites of medieval Europe.
