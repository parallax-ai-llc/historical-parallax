## Summary

On June 28, 1956, the workers of Poznań did the unthinkable: they rose up against communist rule. What began as a strike at the Cegielski metal works became a citywide uprising that saw 100,000 people in the streets, secret police headquarters stormed, and red Soviet flags torn down and burned. By the time tanks rolled in, at least 57 people were dead—the first major bloodshed in the Eastern Bloc since Stalin's death.[^1]

The Poznań uprising was a workers' revolt against a workers' state. The protesters carried signs saying "Bread and Freedom." They demanded better wages, they demanded free elections, and—most dangerously—they demanded the withdrawal of Soviet troops. For one day, Poznań was in open rebellion. Then came the tanks, the soldiers, and the shooting. The youngest victim was a 13-year-old boy named Romek Strzałkowski, shot while carrying a Polish flag.[^2]

The government called it a provocation by "imperialist agents." It was nothing of the sort—it was the authentic rage of workers betrayed by a system that claimed to rule in their name. And while the uprising was crushed, it sent shockwaves through the communist world. Four months later, Poland saw a political thaw, and Hungary exploded into full revolution. Poznań had shown that the empire could crack.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Stalinist Poland

**After World War II:**

- Poland became a Soviet satellite state
- Communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) in power
- Stalinist system: collectivization, political terror
- Economy centrally planned; shortages common

**The death of Stalin (March 1953):**

- Opened possibility of change
- Khrushchev's "Secret Speech" (February 1956) denouncing Stalin
- "Thaw" in Soviet bloc—but uneven[^4]

### Poznań in 1956

**The city:**

- Major industrial center in western Poland
- Cegielski metal works (renamed Stalin works): 15,000 workers
- Workers faced:
  - Wage cuts
  - Raised production quotas
  - Food shortages
  - Housing problems
- International Trade Fair happening that week (foreign visitors present)[^5]

### The Immediate Trigger

**June 1956:**

- Workers sent delegation to Warsaw to negotiate
- Demands: Better wages, reduced quotas
- Delegation returned empty-handed
- Radio Warsaw falsely reported issues resolved

**Workers felt betrayed.** They decided to act.[^6]

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Economic:**

- Real grievances: wages, conditions, quotas
- Workers not benefiting from system supposedly for them

**Political:**

- Thaw after Stalin's death created expectations
- Khrushchev's speech raised hopes
- But reforms too slow

**Sociological:**

- Working class consciousness
- "Workers' state" attacking workers—the irony was not lost

### What Did It Mean?

**For Poland:**

- First mass uprising against communist rule
- Led to Gomułka's return and limited reforms
- "October 1956" became reference point
- Showed regime could be challenged

**For Eastern Bloc:**

- Demonstrated fragility of system
- Inspired Hungarian Revolution (October 1956)
- Showed workers would fight back

**For History:**

- First blood of anti-communist uprisings
- Precursor to 1968 (Czechoslovakia), 1970 (Poland), 1980 (Solidarity)[^10]
