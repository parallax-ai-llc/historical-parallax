## Summary

António de Oliveira Salazar was a Portuguese economist and statesman who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1932 to 1968, making him one of the longest-serving leaders in modern European history. As the architect of the Estado Novo (New State), he established a conservative authoritarian regime that combined Catholic corporatism with strict political control. While he stabilized Portugal's finances and maintained neutrality during World War II, his rule was marked by political repression, censorship, colonial wars, and severe restrictions on civil liberties. His complex legacy continues to divide Portuguese society today.

## Early Life and Background

António de Oliveira Salazar was born on April 28, 1889, in the small village of Vimieiro, near Santa Comba Dão in the Viseu District of central Portugal.[^1] He came from a modest rural family—his father had started as an agricultural laborer before becoming the manager for the Perestrelos, a wealthy family of rural landowners.[^2] The family's humble origins profoundly shaped Salazar's austere worldview and lifelong disdain for extravagance.

At age eleven, Salazar won a scholarship to study at Viseu's seminary, where he remained from 1900 to 1908.[^3] During these eight formative years, he seriously considered becoming a priest and received a deeply Catholic education that would fundamentally influence his political philosophy. However, like many who entered the seminary at a young age, he ultimately decided not to proceed to the priesthood after receiving holy orders.[^4]

In 1910, during the turbulent first years of the Portuguese First Republic, Salazar enrolled at the University of Coimbra to study law.[^5] As a reserved yet brilliant student, he developed a particular fascination with finance and economic policy. He graduated in 1914 with exceptional marks—19 out of 20—and had already begun working as an assistant professor of economic policy at the Law School.[^6] During his student years at Coimbra, he led the Christian Democratic Academic Centre, the best-known Catholic student organization in the city, establishing his reputation as an intellectual leader among conservative Catholic circles.[^7]

In 1917, Salazar assumed the chairs of economic policy and finance at the university, beginning what appeared to be a promising academic career.[^8] His scholarly work focused on fiscal policy and public finance, subjects that would later prove instrumental in his political rise. These early years in Coimbra's academic cloisters cultivated his preference for intellectual rigor, Catholic social doctrine, and political conservatism.

## Rise to Power

Salazar's transition from academic obscurity to political prominence was gradual but ultimately transformative for Portugal. In 1921, he helped form the Catholic Centre Party and was elected to the Cortes (parliament).[^9] However, the political chaos and instability of the First Portuguese Republic deeply disillusioned him. He resigned after just one parliamentary session and returned to the quiet certainty of university life.[^10]

The military coup of May 28, 1926, which overthrew Portugal's parliamentary government, created new opportunities. Shortly after the coup, Salazar was offered the cabinet post of Minister of Finance, but he turned it down because he could not obtain his own conditions for absolute control over government finances.[^11] Between 1926 and 1928, he rejected several appointments to the finance ministry, citing ill health, devotion to his aged parents, and a preference for academic life.[^12]

Portugal's financial crisis continued to worsen, however, with mounting debts and currency instability threatening the viability of the new military regime. When General António Óscar de Fragoso Carmona was elected president in March 1928, he personally urged Salazar to reconsider.[^13] This time, Salazar agreed—but only on his own extraordinary terms. On April 26, 1928, he was appointed Minister of Finance with unprecedented decree powers, including veto authority over all government expenditures and sole discretion over revenues.[^14] According to historical accounts, the President of the Council, Colonel Vicente de Freitas, agreed to all of Salazar's conditions, reportedly saying: "Yes sir, full powers, total, absolute, power of veto, anything you want, provided you come!"[^15]

Armed with these broad powers to restructure state finances, Salazar achieved remarkable results within one year. He balanced the budget, stabilized Portugal's currency, and produced the first of many budgetary surpluses.[^16] His financial success made him indispensable to the military dictatorship. Gaining steadily in political power and influence, Salazar was named Prime Minister by President Carmona on July 5, 1932.[^17]

## Major Achievements

### Constitutional and Political Restructuring

After becoming Prime Minister, Salazar drafted a new constitution that reorganized Portugal's political system along authoritarian and corporatist lines.[^18] Having come to power under the Ditadura Nacional ("National Dictatorship"), he reframed the regime as the Estado Novo ("New State") in 1933, establishing himself as the unchallenged leader.[^19] The Estado Novo was based on Catholic social doctrine, particularly the papal encyclicals *Rerum Novarum* and *Quadragesimo Anno*, which emphasized corporatist organization to prevent class struggle.[^20]

The regime featured a mixed economy with extensive state regulation alongside private ownership of the means of production.[^21] Political power was concentrated in Salazar's hands, but he carefully distinguished his system from fascism and totalitarianism, which he considered "pagan Caesarism" that recognized neither legal nor moral limits.[^22] Scholars including Stanley G. Payne, Juan José Linz, and Howard J. Wiarda have classified the Estado Novo as conservative authoritarian rather than fascist.[^23]

### Economic Stabilization and Development

Salazar's early economic achievements were substantial. He promptly balanced the budget, restored the gold standard, and made Portugal self-sufficient in wheat production.[^24] From the 1930s until the early 1960s, Portugal's fiscal accounts almost always maintained a surplus in the current account, providing resources to finance public infrastructure projects without resorting to inflationary financing or foreign borrowing.[^25]

His government invested in infrastructure, building roads, ports, and dams to modernize the country.[^26] The Ponte Salazar (later renamed the 25 de Abril Bridge after the 1974 revolution) became the most iconic achievement of this period.[^27] The last years of the Salazar era witnessed the creation of important privately organized ventures, including an integrated iron and steel mill, a modern ship repair and shipbuilding complex, vehicle assembly plants, oil refineries, petrochemical plants, and pulp and paper mills.[^28]

Economic growth from 1960 to 1973 was characterized by robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9%), industrial production (9%), private consumption (6.5%), and gross fixed capital formation (7.8%).[^29] In 1960, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community average; by 1968, it had risen to 48 percent, and by 1973 it reached 56.4 percent.[^30]

### World War II Neutrality

Salazar's most diplomatically complex achievement was maintaining Portuguese neutrality during World War II. On September 1, 1939, after the German invasion of Poland, he declared Portugal's neutrality while affirming that the 550-year-old Anglo-Portuguese Alliance remained intact.[^31] Portugal became strategically vital because of its tungsten (wolfram) deposits, which were essential for hardening steel in German weapons production.[^32]

Salazar carefully balanced competing Allied and Axis pressures. Germany received approximately 75 percent of Portugal's wolfram exports, while Britain received only 25 percent, though Britain could pay on credit while Germany had to pay cash.[^33] Initially assuming Hitler would force Britain to surrender, Portugal tilted toward Germany until mid-1943.[^34] However, following Allied threats of economic sanctions, Portugal implemented a complete embargo on wolfram exports to both sides on June 5, 1944.[^35]

### International Integration

Despite his reservations about sovereignty pooling, Salazar oversaw Portugal's integration into key Western institutions. Portugal became one of the twelve founding members of NATO in 1949, largely because the United States wanted access to the strategically important Lajes Air Base in the Azores.[^36] Portugal joined the European Payments Union in 1950 and was one of the founding members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960.[^37] Though skeptical of European federalism, Salazar accepted American aid through the Marshall Plan.[^38]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Political Repression and Secret Police

The Estado Novo regime maintained power through systematic political repression. The PIDE (Polícia Internacional e de Defesa do Estado), established in 1933 as the PVDE and reorganized in 1945, served as the regime's secret police.[^39] PIDE existed not only to protect national security but also to monitor the population, enforce censorship, and suppress political opponents.[^40]

PIDE was credited with the torture and assassination of many political activists and had extrajudicial powers of detention.[^41] Using a wide network of covert cells throughout Portugal and its overseas territories, PIDE infiltrated almost every underground movement.[^42] Political prisoners were incarcerated in detention centers such as Caxias prison near Lisbon or the notorious Tarrafal concentration camp in Cape Verde, where torture was systematic.[^43]

### Tarrafal: The "Camp of Slow Death"

Tarrafal concentration camp was established in 1936 on the island of Santiago in Cape Verde by direct order of Salazar.[^44] Known as the "camp of slow death," it operated in two distinct phases. During the first phase (1936-1954), among 340 Portuguese political prisoners who passed through the camp, 34 perished due to inhumane conditions.[^45] The "Frigideira" (frying pan)—an "elimination chamber"—was used to torture prisoners with temperatures between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius, killing 30 prisoners and sickening dozens more.[^46]

In 1961, the camp reopened to detain African freedom fighters from Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Cape Verde, with more than 200 African nationalists imprisoned during this second phase until the camp's closure in 1974.[^47]

### Censorship and Propaganda

In 1933, Salazar inaugurated the Secretariado da Propaganda Nacional (SPN), later renamed Secretariado Nacional de Informação (SNI) in 1944/45.[^48] António Ferro, who had written favorable accounts of European dictatorships, directed these organizations for sixteen years, implementing propaganda strategies and comprehensive censorship.[^49] The Estado Novo maintained an official "Censorship Service" that controlled all cultural production and wielded Ferro's "politics of the spirit" to shape both domestic and international perceptions of Portugal.[^50]

### Colonial Wars

Unlike other European nations during the 1950s and 1960s, the Portuguese Estado Novo regime refused to decolonize its African territories.[^51] During the 1960s, nationalist movements emerged—the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA), and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in Angola; the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) in Portuguese Guinea; and the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) in Mozambique.[^52]

The Portuguese government refused to acknowledge the inevitability of African independence.[^53] After the outbreak of violence in 1961, U.S. President John F. Kennedy sent a message to Salazar advising Portugal to abandon its African colonies, but Salazar consolidated power and immediately sent reinforcements to the overseas territories.[^54] The resulting colonial wars, lasting from 1961 to 1974, destroyed the Estado Novo, impoverished Portugal, and caused immense suffering.[^55]

### Restrictions on Women's Rights

During the Estado Novo, women's rights were heavily restricted. Article 5 of the 1933 Constitution stated that citizens were equal, "except for the woman, the differences resulting from her nature and the good of the family."[^56] Women needed secondary education to vote, while men only needed basic literacy—a significant barrier given that in 1960, illiteracy rates were 36.7 percent for women and 24.9 percent for men.[^57]

Married women could not travel out of the country without their husband's consent (until 1969) and required their husband's permission to work, publish books, enter contracts, own property, or maintain bank accounts.[^58] Salazarism "used female 'nature' to deny women complete equality," rooted in Catholic Church ideology.[^59] In 1937, public nursery schools were closed because Salazar believed women's primary role was childcare.[^60]

### Electoral Fraud and Repression of Opposition

The 1958 presidential election represented the most significant challenge to Salazar's regime. Air Force General Humberto Delgado ran as an independent opposition candidate backed by socialists, republicans, democrats, liberals, monarchists, and Catholics.[^61] When asked what he would do about Salazar, Delgado famously replied, "Obviously, I'll sack him," earning him the nickname "General sem Medo" (Fearless General).[^62]

PIDE harassed and attacked Delgado voters and supporters, and widespread electoral fraud occurred.[^63] Salazar refused to allow opposition representatives to observe ballot counting.[^64] Many neutral observers believe Delgado would have won in a landslide in an honest election. In response to Delgado's strong showing, Salazar amended the Constitution in 1959 to transfer presidential elections to the National Assembly, eliminating direct presidential elections.[^65] Delgado was expelled from the military, went into exile, and in 1965 was lured into an ambush by PIDE and killed.[^66]

## Personal Life

António de Oliveira Salazar remained unmarried throughout his life, maintaining an austere, almost monastic existence.[^67] He shunned publicity and raised few monuments to himself, presenting himself as a selfless servant of the nation rather than a personality cult leader.[^68] His devotion to his aged parents was cited as one reason for initially turning down ministerial appointments.[^69]

Salazar's personality was characterized by intellectual rigor, deep Catholic faith, and extreme reserve. Unlike other authoritarian leaders of his era, he avoided populist rhetoric and ostentatious displays of power.[^70] He lived modestly and dedicated himself to work, presenting the image of a technocratic administrator rather than a charismatic strongman.

His rule was conservative, corporatist, and Portuguese nationalist in nature.[^71] He distanced himself from Nazism and fascism, which he described as "pagan Caesarism" that did not recognize legal, religious, or moral limits.[^72] While he promoted Catholicism, he argued that the Church's role was social rather than political, maintaining a strict separation of church and state despite the 1940 Concordat.[^73]

Salazar suffered a stroke in September 1968 after a fall in his home and went into a coma.[^74] On September 27, 1968, President Américo Tomás chose Marcelo Caetano to replace Salazar as Prime Minister.[^75] In a poignant detail revealing the regime's paternalistic deception, Salazar was never told that he had been replaced and reportedly died on July 27, 1970, still believing he was Prime Minister.[^76]

## Legacy

António de Oliveira Salazar's legacy remains deeply contested in Portugal and among historians. His regime lasted from 1928 to 1968—one of the longest tenures in modern history—and the Estado Novo system he created endured until the Carnation Revolution of 1974, four years after his death.[^77]

### Economic Legacy

Salazar's economic legacy is mixed. He successfully disciplined Portuguese public finances after the chaotic First Portuguese Republic, establishing fiscal stability and budgetary surpluses.[^78] However, consistent economic growth and development remained scarce until well into the 1960s, when a new generation of technocrats with backgrounds in economics and technical-industrial expertise began influencing Portuguese economic policy.[^79]

Three decades of the Estado Novo regime increased Portugal's GDP per capita from only 36 percent of the EC-12 average in 1930 to 39 percent in 1960—marginal progress that left Portugal among Europe's poorest countries.[^80] Only from 1950 until Salazar's death did Portugal see meaningful GDP per capita growth at an annual average rate of 3.7 to 5.7 percent.[^81]

### Political Legacy

The Estado Novo was one of the longest-lived authoritarian regimes in modern Europe, enduring for 41 years (1933-1974).[^82] It established a model of conservative authoritarianism distinct from fascism and totalitarianism, though this distinction remains contested among scholars.[^83] The regime's political repression, secret police apparatus, and colonial policies left deep scars on Portuguese society.

The Carnation Revolution of 1974 peacefully overthrew the Estado Novo, bringing democracy to Portugal and ending the colonial wars.[^84] Women achieved full legal equality only after the revolution and the 1976 constitution.[^85]

### Contemporary Resonance

Salazar's legacy continues to generate controversy in contemporary Portugal. In 2007, Portuguese public broadcaster RTP conducted a poll called "Os Grandes Portugueses" (The Greatest Portuguese), which Salazar won with 41.0 percent of the top ten votes.[^86] The result generated significant controversy, with older generations reacting with pride while others felt embarrassment and shame.[^87]

The poll's validity was questioned when simultaneous scientific polls produced very different results—a Marktest poll showed Salazar was the favorite of only 11 percent, and an RTP-commissioned Eurosondagem poll ranked him seventh with 6.6 percent.[^88] Ironically, Salazar also won a parallel vote for "Os Piores Portugueses" (The Worst Portuguese).[^89]

Fifty years after the democratic revolution, the far-right Chega party has risen by exploiting nostalgia for the Salazar era, adopting his old slogan "God, country, family" (adding "work" to the roster).[^90] This nostalgia reflects some Portuguese citizens' longing for a national narrative of strength and influence, amplified by the social scars of recent austerity policies.[^91]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some Portuguese scholars and citizens view Salazar's early reforms positively. Historians like Jaime Nogueira Pinto and Rui Ramos argue that his policies changed the nation by permitting political and financial stability, creating a calm social order and enabling economic growth.[^92] Defenders emphasize his fiscal discipline, infrastructure development, and success in keeping Portugal neutral during World War II while maintaining the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance.[^93]

Salazar's supporters credit him with saving Portugal from the chaos of the First Republic, establishing budgetary discipline, and modernizing the country's infrastructure during the 1960s.[^94] They note that his regime, while authoritarian, was not totalitarian and maintained some legal and constitutional limits.[^95] The rise of technocrats in the early 1960s made Portugal an attractive country for international investment and sparked genuine economic growth.[^96]

His diplomatic balancing act during World War II is viewed by some as a masterful achievement—maintaining nominal neutrality while providing critical support to the Allies (especially through the Azores base) without provoking German invasion.[^97] The Iberian Pact of 1939 with Franco's Spain proved decisive in keeping the Iberian Peninsula out of Hitler's continental system.[^98]

### Negative Views

Left-wing historians like Fernando Rosas point out that Salazar's policies from the 1930s to the 1950s led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration, turning Portugal into one of Europe's poorest countries.[^99] Critics emphasize the regime's political repression, torture, political assassinations, censorship, and denial of fundamental civil liberties.[^100]

The colonial wars from 1961 to 1974 are widely condemned as futile conflicts that destroyed the Estado Novo, impoverished Portugal, and caused immense suffering in Africa.[^101] Salazar's refusal to acknowledge decolonization trends trapped Portugal in unwinnable wars that consumed resources and lives.[^102]

The systematic violations of human rights—including the Tarrafal concentration camp, PIDE torture, extrajudicial killings (such as Humberto Delgado's assassination), and severe restrictions on women's rights—represent indelible moral failures.[^103] The Estado Novo's censorship apparatus stifled cultural and intellectual development, while economic stagnation until the 1960s kept Portugal backward compared to Western Europe.[^104]

Portuguese historians increasingly view Salazar as a dictator whose authoritarian rule, though perhaps less brutal than fascist totalitarianism, nevertheless inflicted lasting damage on Portuguese society, delayed democratic development, and perpetuated colonial oppression.[^105]
