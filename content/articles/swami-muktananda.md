## Summary

Swami Muktananda was an Indian guru who brought Siddha Yoga to the West. He was a disciple of Bhagawan Nityananda and became known for the practice of Shaktipat — the transmission of spiritual energy from guru to disciple through touch, word, or thought. He founded the Siddha Yoga movement and established ashrams worldwide. His autobiography Play of Consciousness became an influential spiritual text. His legacy has been complicated by allegations of misconduct.
