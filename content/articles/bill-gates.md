Bill Gates is the co-founder of Microsoft and one of the world's most prominent philanthropists. His association with Jeffrey Epstein after Epstein's 2008 conviction has been a source of controversy and scrutiny.

## Background

William Henry Gates III co-founded Microsoft in 1975 and built it into the world's largest PC software company. After stepping down from day-to-day operations, he focused on the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world's largest charitable organizations.

## Association with Jeffrey Epstein

Gates met with Epstein multiple times between 2011 and 2014, well after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. The meetings occurred at:

- Epstein's Manhattan townhouse
- Various dinners and events
- At least one flight on Epstein's private jet

## Stated Reasons for Contact

Gates and his representatives stated the meetings were for:
- Philanthropic partnerships
- Potential donations to global health initiatives
- Introductions to other philanthropists and wealthy donors

Epstein reportedly presented himself as connected to influential people and institutions, which interested Gates for fundraising purposes.

## Controversy and Criticism

The relationship drew significant criticism:

**Timing**: The meetings occurred years after Epstein's conviction
**Denial then Admission**: Gates initially downplayed contact before documents revealed more extensive meetings
**Impact on Marriage**: The relationship was reportedly a factor in Bill and Melinda Gates' divorce

## Gates' Response

In interviews, Gates has stated:
- Meeting Epstein was a "huge mistake"
- He regrets the association
- The meetings were "a mistake in judgment"
- He never had a business relationship with Epstein
