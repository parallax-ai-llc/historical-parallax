## Summary

Jigoro Kano was a Japanese educator who founded Judo and pioneered modern martial arts philosophy. While primarily known for martial arts, he integrated Zen Buddhist and Confucian principles into his educational philosophy. His concept of 'maximum efficiency, minimum effort' (seiryoku zenyo) and 'mutual welfare and benefit' (jita kyoei) applied spiritual principles to physical practice. He was the first Asian member of the International Olympic Committee.
