## Summary

Friedrich Wöhler was a German chemist best known for his synthesis of urea from inorganic materials in 1828, which disproved the theory of vitalism. This synthesis is considered a watershed moment in the history of chemistry, bridging organic and inorganic chemistry. He also isolated the elements aluminum, beryllium, and yttrium. Wöhler co-founded the influential journal Annalen der Chemie.
