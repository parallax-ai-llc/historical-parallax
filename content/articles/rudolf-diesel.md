## Summary

Rudolf Diesel was a German inventor and mechanical engineer who invented the diesel engine, an internal combustion engine that ignites fuel by compression rather than spark ignition. His engine was more efficient than existing steam and gasoline engines and became crucial to transportation, industry, and power generation. Diesel mysteriously disappeared from a steamer crossing the English Channel in 1913; his body was found later.
