## Summary

While Takashi Murakami is primarily a contemporary artist, his 'Superflat' theory systematically analyzes the flattening of distinction between high and low culture in post-war Japan, and his factory-style art production methods apply industrial engineering principles to artistic creation. He bridges art, commerce, and technology.
