## Summary

Alice Ball was an African-American chemist who developed the most effective treatment for Hansen's disease (leprosy) during the early 20th century. Her 'Ball Method' involved creating injectable ethyl ester forms of chaulmoogra oil, making it absorbable by the body. She was the first African-American and first woman to earn a master's degree from the University of Hawaii. She died at age 24 before she could publish her work.
