## Summary

In December 2022, Peru's president tried to dissolve Congress. Within hours, he was arrested, impeached, and replaced by his vice president. That might have been the end of it—another episode in Peru's endless political crisis. Instead, it sparked the deadliest unrest Peru had seen in decades. At least 69 people died, most shot by police in the southern highlands, as protesters demanded the new president's resignation and early elections.[^1]

Pedro Castillo, a rural schoolteacher who had become the country's first leftist president, announced on December 7, 2022, that he would close Congress and rule by decree. It was a reckless self-coup that lasted about two hours. Congress removed him; police arrested him en route to the Mexican embassy. His vice president, Dina Boluarte, was sworn in immediately. But for Castillo's supporters—poor, Indigenous, rural—this was the latest in centuries of Lima imposing its will on the provinces.[^2]

The protests that erupted were met with lethal force. The Juliaca massacre of January 2023, where 18 people were killed in a single day, became symbolic of a government willing to shoot its own citizens. The movement eventually subsided, but Boluarte remains deeply unpopular, facing criminal investigation for the deaths. Peru's political crisis—seven presidents in six years—shows no sign of ending.[^3]

## The Self-Coup and Ouster

### December 7, 2022

- Install "emergency government"

**The response (within hours):**

- Military refused to support
- Congress voted to remove him (101-6)

**By afternoon:**

- **Dina Boluarte** sworn in as president

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Immediate:**

- Castillo's self-coup triggered
- But removal triggered counter-reaction

**Structural:**

- Lima vs. provinces
- Racial/ethnic divide (Indigenous neglected)
- Congress dysfunction
- Institutional collapse

**Historical:**

- Centuries of marginalization
- Castillo = first person like them to be president
- His removal felt like theft

### Why Was the Response So Deadly?

**State willingness to kill:**

- Police shot live ammunition
- Military backed Boluarte
- State of emergency used as cover

**Vulnerability of protesters:**

- Rural, far from capital
- Indigenous
- Less visible to Lima media

### Comparison to Other Crises

| Country      | Crisis          | Deaths | Outcome                                    |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Peru 2022-23 | Castillo ouster | 69     | Government survived                        |
| Bolivia 2019 | Morales ouster  | 35     | Interim government, eventual return of MAS |
| Ecuador 2019 | Fuel protests   | 11     | Government conceded                        |

**Peru showed particularly high death toll for Latin America recent protests.**[^11]

## Legacy

### For Peru

- Deep wounds between Lima and interior
- Indigenous communities' distrust deepened
- Political crisis continues
- No truth commission yet

### The Victims

- Remembered by families
- Some memorials in Puno, Ayacucho
- January 9 especially commemorated

### Unresolved Questions

- Will anyone be held accountable?
- Will structural issues be addressed?
- Can Peru break the cycle?

**The 2022-2023 crisis exposed Peru's fractures. It did not heal them.**[^12]
