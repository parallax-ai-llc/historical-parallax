## Summary

Burhanuddin Mohammad Diah (B.M. Diah) was one of Indonesia's most prominent journalists and a pivotal figure in the nation's independence movement. Born in Banda Aceh in 1917, he witnessed and participated in the drafting of Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence, heroically rescuing the original handwritten text from a trash can and preserving it for nearly half a century. As founder of the influential Merdeka newspaper and the English-language Indonesian Observer, B.M. Diah shaped Indonesian journalism for decades. He later served as Minister of Information during the critical transition from Sukarno's "Old Order" to Suharto's "New Order" regime, navigating the complex political currents of post-independence Indonesia until his death in 1996.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Burhanuddin Mohammad Diah was born on April 7, 1917, in Kuta Raja (now Banda Aceh), the capital of Aceh province in northern Sumatra. His father, Mohammad Diah, worked as a customs officer and translator from Barus, North Sumatra, while his mother, Siti Sa'idah, was an Acehnese housewife. Born only as "Burhanuddin," he later adopted his father's name as a surname, becoming known as Burhanuddin Mohammad Diah, commonly abbreviated as B.M. Diah. He was the youngest of eight children and also had two half-brothers from his father's second marriage.[^3][^4]

Growing up in colonial Indonesia under Dutch rule, young Burhanuddin received his early education at the Hollandsch-Inlandsche School (HIS), a Dutch-Native school that provided Western-style education to select indigenous students. He continued his education at Taman Siswa Medan, an institution founded by the Indonesian nationalist Ki Hadjar Dewantara that emphasized indigenous Indonesian values and culture as an alternative to colonial education.[^5][^6]

At the age of 17, Burhanuddin migrated to Jakarta, seeking greater opportunities in the colonial capital. There he enrolled at the Ksatrian Instituut (also known as Middelbaar National Handels Collegium), a private school for economics and journalism led by Ernest Douwes Dekker, a prominent Indo-European nationalist. At this institution, Burhanuddin chose to major in journalism, a decision that would define his entire career and legacy. After completing his education, he returned to Medan where he began his journalistic career as an editor of the daily newspaper Sinar Deli.[^7][^8]

## Rise to Power

B.M. Diah's ascent in Indonesian journalism and politics occurred during one of the most turbulent periods in the nation's history—the Japanese occupation and the struggle for independence. When Japan invaded and occupied the Dutch East Indies in 1942, Diah found opportunities in the Japanese-controlled media landscape. He worked at Radio Hosokyoku as an English broadcaster while simultaneously serving as assistant editor at Asia Raya, a Japanese propaganda newspaper. During this period, he was detained for four days by Japanese authorities, though the reasons remain unclear. It was at Radio Hosokyoku that he met Siti Latifah Herawati Diah, a broadcaster who had graduated from Barnard College in the United States with degrees in journalism and sociology—the first Indonesian woman to graduate from an American university. They married on August 18, 1942, in a ceremony attended by future president Sukarno and future vice president Mohammad Hatta.[^9][^10][^11]

In April 1945, as Japan's defeat became increasingly apparent, B.M. Diah and his wife Herawati founded the Indonesian Observer, an English-language newspaper (though sources also indicate they later re-founded or re-launched it during the 1955 Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung to improve communication between Asia, Africa, and the outside world).[^12][^13] In June 1945, Diah became involved in the founding of the Indonesian New Forces Movement (Gerakan Angkatan Baru Indonesia), a federation of youth groups dedicated to the struggle for Indonesian independence, and was appointed chairman of the founding committee.[^14]

Diah's most historically significant moment came on the night of August 16-17, 1945, when he was present at the residence of Japanese Rear Admiral Tadashi Maeda at Jalan Imam Bonjol No. 1 (then Jalan Nusantara), where the text of Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence was being drafted. While Sukarno wrote the conceptual text in one room, Diah waited in another room alongside Sayuti Melik, Sukarni, and Soediro. After Sayuti Melik typed the final version, the handwritten draft by Sukarno was discarded in a trash basket. Diah retrieved it, recognizing its immense historical value—a decision that would preserve one of Indonesia's most precious national treasures.[^15][^16][^17]

Following the proclamation on August 17, 1945, Vice President Mohammad Hatta personally assigned Diah a crucial mission. As Hatta later recounted: "Before we went home, I advised several young people who entered the press class, especially BM Diah: you have worked hard every day but you must also continue with the activeness of the new work, namely increasing the text of the Proclamation and spreading it throughout Indonesia as much as possible." Diah executed this mission with remarkable speed and dedication, obtaining approximately one thousand leaflets from a printing station and distributing them throughout Jakarta with the help of a truck driver named Boos, spreading them from Jalan Nusantara to Prapatan and other areas around Gambir, before the text was reproduced and disseminated to remote areas of the archipelago.[^18][^19]

On October 1, 1945, just six weeks after independence, Diah and colleagues including Joesoef Isak and Rosihan Anwar took up arms and seized the Djawa Shimbun printing press, which had previously published the Japanese propaganda newspaper Asia Raya. They transformed it into the Harian Merdeka (Merdeka Daily), with Diah as editor-in-chief, Joesoef Isak as deputy, and Rosihan Anwar as editor. Merdeka would become one of Indonesia's most influential newspapers and establish Diah as a leading voice in Indonesian journalism.[^20][^21]

## Major Achievements

B.M. Diah's career spanned journalism, diplomacy, and government service, with achievements that left lasting impacts on multiple spheres of Indonesian public life. His founding and leadership of Merdeka newspaper established him as one of the "Empat Sekawan" (Four Comrades)—a group of four prominent newspaper editors in the 1950s that also included Mochtar Lubis of Indonesia Raya, Rosihan Anwar of Pedoman, and S. Tasrif of Abadi. During the era of liberal parliamentary democracy in the first half of the 1950s, personal journalism dominated Indonesian media, with each newspaper closely identified with its charismatic leader. Diah embodied this phenomenon, using Merdeka as a platform for nationalist advocacy and political commentary.[^22][^23]

In 1955, during the historic Asia-Africa Conference in Bandung—a pivotal gathering of newly independent Asian and African nations that laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement—Diah and his wife Herawati founded or re-launched the Indonesian Observer as an English-language publication aimed at improving communication between Asia, Africa, and the international community. This newspaper played an important role in projecting Indonesian perspectives to English-speaking audiences worldwide during the crucial early years of independence.[^24][^25]

Diah's diplomatic career began when he was appointed ambassador to Communist Hungary and Czechoslovakia, unusual postings that demonstrated the Sukarno government's commitment to non-alignment during the Cold War. In 1964, he was appointed Ambassador to the United Kingdom, a prestigious position that reflected his growing stature. During these diplomatic postings, his wife Herawati leveraged informal spaces and cultural diplomacy to advance Indonesia's national interests, redefining the role of a diplomat's spouse.[^26][^27]

In 1966, during the tumultuous transition from Sukarno's "Old Order" to Suharto's "New Order," Diah was appointed as Indonesia's 18th Minister of Information, serving until 1968. This appointment was particularly remarkable given that Diah was known as a fierce nationalist and Sukarnoist who had disagreed with the military during the October 17, 1965 affair and had moved from place to place to avoid military officers. His appointment during this "uneasy transition" demonstrated either his political adaptability or the new regime's desire to co-opt respected nationalist figures.[^28][^29] After his ministerial tenure, he served in the People's Representative Council (DPR) and the Supreme Advisory Council (DPA).[^30]

In the business sphere, Diah and his wife developed the Hyatt Aryaduta Jakarta hotel on land where Herawati's parents' home once stood. Construction of the Hotel Ambassador began in 1971, and the 216-room hotel opened on June 1, 1974, initially managed by French airline UTA. On January 1, 1976, it became the Hyatt Aryaduta Jakarta under a 10-year contract with Hyatt International. An extension was added in 1985-1986, increasing capacity to 341 rooms. Before his death, Diah served as Deputy Leader of PT Hotel Prapatan-Jakarta, the company that owned the hotel.[^31][^32]

One of Diah's most memorable journalistic achievements came late in his career when, in 1987 at age 70, he interviewed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia—a significant accomplishment that demonstrated his continued relevance and access to world leaders.[^33] At the ten-year celebration of the Indonesian Journalists Association (PWI) in 1956, Diah, along with Rosihan Anwar and S. Tahsin, proposed establishing a foundation to oversee the National Press Museum, contributing to the preservation of Indonesian press history.[^34]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his nationalist credentials, B.M. Diah's career was not without controversy, particularly regarding his relationship with authoritarian regimes. His appointment as Minister of Information during the New Order transition placed him in a contradictory position. Although he had been a Sukarnoist who fled from military officers during the 1965-1966 upheaval, he ultimately accepted a high-ranking position in the very government that had overthrown Sukarno and was establishing authoritarian controls over the press.[^35][^36]

The New Order regime under Suharto imposed severe restrictions on press freedom. Twelve newspapers were closed and journalists detained without trial, stimulating widespread self-censorship. The military command for the restoration of security and order (Kopkamtib) functioned as media censors, implementing new restrictions, while a government press council set rules for what the press could and could not publish. The regime monitored the press to ensure that no issues would be raised to challenge its authority.[^37][^38] As Minister of Information from 1966-1968, Diah bore responsibility for implementing or tolerating these early press restrictions, even as his own newspaper operated under these constraints.

Even Diah's own newspaper, Merdeka, was not immune to government pressure. Joesoef Isak, his deputy editor and a Sukarnoist, had to be dismissed at the insistence of the New Order government—a clear demonstration of regime interference even in Diah's personal journalistic enterprise.[^39] This incident raised questions about how much editorial independence Diah was willing to sacrifice for political accommodation.

Critics might argue that Diah's acceptance of honors from the Suharto regime—including the Bintang Mahaputra Utama awarded by President Suharto on May 10, 1978—and his decision to hand over the original Proclamation text to Suharto in 1992 (or 1993, sources vary) represented a form of legitimization of an authoritarian government responsible for human rights abuses, including the mass killings of 1965-1966.[^40][^41] Some might view these actions as collaboration with authoritarianism rather than principled journalism.

Furthermore, while Diah is celebrated for preserving the original Proclamation text, he kept this precious national artifact in private hands for nearly half a century (from 1945 until 1992/1993) rather than immediately depositing it in national archives where historians and the public could access it. This raises questions about whether personal possession of such artifacts serves the national interest or merely individual prestige.

---

## Personal Life

B.M. Diah's personal life was deeply intertwined with his professional endeavors, particularly through his partnership with his wife, Siti Latifah Herawati Diah. Their marriage on August 18, 1942, united two pioneering Indonesian journalists—a union that would last over five decades until Diah's death in 1996. Herawati, who had graduated from Barnard College in 1941 as the first Indonesian woman to earn a degree from a U.S. university, was not merely a supportive spouse but an accomplished journalist and women's activist in her own right.[^42][^43]

Together, they had three children: two daughters, Nurdi Diah and Adiniawati Diah, and one son, Nurman Diah, who later became father-in-law to actress Shelomita Diah.[^44] The Diah household was one where journalism, politics, and national service were family affairs. Herawati worked alongside her husband at the Indonesian Observer and, during his diplomatic postings, engaged in what scholars have termed "cultural diplomacy," leveraging informal spaces to advance Indonesia's national interests in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the United Kingdom, and Thailand—a practice that redefined the role of diplomats' spouses.[^45]

B.M. Diah was known as a fierce nationalist with strong convictions, characteristics that sometimes put him at odds with political authorities. His Sukarnoist sympathies during the tumultuous period of 1965-1966 forced him to move from place to place to avoid military officers, demonstrating both his political courage and the dangers faced by journalists during Indonesia's political upheavals.[^46] Despite these tensions, he proved capable of political adaptation, accepting high office under the very military-backed government he had initially opposed.

Diah's personality combined journalistic enterprise with business acumen, as evidenced by his development of the Hyatt Aryaduta hotel with his wife. He maintained friendships with other prominent Indonesian journalists, including Mochtar Lubis, Rosihan Anwar, and Ruslan Abdulgani, who attended his funeral. His network extended internationally, as demonstrated by his 1987 interview with Mikhail Gorbachev.[^47][^48]

Herawati Diah outlived her husband by twenty years, passing away on September 30, 2016, at age 99, having continued her own distinguished career in journalism and women's advocacy long after his death.[^49]

## Legacy

B.M. Diah's legacy is multifaceted, encompassing his contributions to Indonesian independence, journalism, and national memory. His most enduring legacy is arguably his preservation of the original handwritten draft of Indonesia's Proclamation of Independence—an artifact of incalculable historical and symbolic value. The fact that this document exists today is entirely due to Diah's foresight in retrieving it from a trash basket at Admiral Maeda's house on August 17, 1945. When he finally handed it over to the government on May 29, 1992 (or 1993), and it was subsequently deposited in the National Archives (ANRI), it became accessible for public display during independence commemorations, allowing generations of Indonesians to connect directly with their founding moment.[^50][^51][^52]

As a journalist, Diah helped establish the foundations of independent Indonesian journalism in the immediate post-independence period. Merdeka newspaper, which he founded just six weeks after the Proclamation, demonstrated the vital role of a free press in a newly independent nation. Along with his colleagues in the "Empat Sekawan," Diah embodied the era of personal journalism in the 1950s when charismatic editors shaped public discourse and held power accountable—at least until Sukarno's Guided Democracy and Suharto's New Order imposed increasing restrictions.[^53][^54]

Diah's role in disseminating the Proclamation throughout Indonesia at Hatta's request made him not just a witness to history but an active participant in creating the Indonesian nation. His distribution of one thousand leaflets throughout Jakarta and their subsequent reproduction for remote areas meant that millions of Indonesians learned of their independence through materials Diah helped spread.[^55]

His burial at Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery with full military honors on June 10, 1996, attended by President Suharto, Vice President Try Sutrisno, ministers, and prominent figures including Harmoko, Emil Salim, Sutiyoso, Ruslan Abdulgani, Soebadio Sastrosatomo, Mochtar Lubis, and Supeni, demonstrated the nation's official recognition of his contributions.[^56][^57] Harmoko, who served as Minister of Information at Diah's death, had previously worked as a reporter for Diah in the 1960s, illustrating Diah's influence on subsequent generations of Indonesian journalists.[^58]

The Diah family's journalistic legacy continued through his wife Herawati's work until her death in 2016, and their contributions to Indonesian journalism are preserved in the National Press Museum, whose establishment Diah helped propose in 1956.[^59]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and journalists who celebrate B.M. Diah emphasize his indispensable role in preserving Indonesia's founding document and his courage in spreading independence news at a critical juncture. As one source notes, he was "an important figure for spreading news on the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence throughout the country," executing a mission personally assigned by Vice President Hatta.[^60] His quick thinking in retrieving the discarded Proclamation draft has been characterized as an act of historical preservation comparable to saving a national treasure from destruction.

Supporters highlight Diah's versatility—he was not merely a journalist but also a successful diplomat, businessman, and government minister who served his nation in multiple capacities across different political eras. His ability to navigate the transition from Dutch colonialism through Japanese occupation, the revolutionary period, parliamentary democracy, Guided Democracy, and the New Order demonstrates remarkable adaptability and survival skills in Indonesia's turbulent political landscape.[^61]

Diah is remembered as part of the "Empat Sekawan" who defined Indonesian journalism's golden age in the 1950s, when personal journalism and editorial independence flourished before the authoritarian clampdowns of later decades. His founding of both Indonesian-language (Merdeka) and English-language (Indonesian Observer) newspapers demonstrated his understanding that Indonesia needed to communicate both domestically and internationally.[^62] The Indonesian Observer, particularly in its role during the 1955 Bandung Conference, helped project Indonesian and broader Asian-African perspectives to global English-speaking audiences.

Admirers also point to Diah's principled resistance during certain periods, noting that he was a "fierce nationalist and Sukarnoist who disagreed with the military during the 17 October affair" and had to flee military pursuit—evidence of genuine political conviction rather than mere opportunism.[^63] His demonstrated commitment to using the term "Tiongkok" rather than "Cina" for China, maintaining this usage when most newspapers capitulated to New Order pressure, showed editorial independence even under authoritarianism.[^64]

### Negative Views

Critics of B.M. Diah focus primarily on his accommodation with the authoritarian New Order regime despite his earlier nationalist and Sukarnoist credentials. His acceptance of the position of Minister of Information from 1966-1968, during the crucial formative period when Suharto's regime was establishing its authoritarian controls, raises serious questions about political principles versus pragmatic careerism. As Information Minister during this period, Diah bore institutional responsibility for press policies at a time when "twelve newspapers were closed and journalists detained without trial, thus stimulating self-censorship" and "Kopkamtib functioned as media censors and implemented new restrictions on the press."[^65]

Skeptics argue that Diah's later relationship with Suharto—accepting the Bintang Mahaputra Utama award in 1978 and ceremonially handing over the Proclamation text to Suharto in 1992—represented a form of collaboration that helped legitimize a regime responsible for mass killings in 1965-1966 and decades of authoritarian rule. The fact that even his own newspaper, Merdeka, was forced to dismiss Joesoef Isak at the New Order government's insistence demonstrates that Diah either lacked the courage to resist such interference or prioritized his newspaper's survival over editorial independence.[^66]

Critics also question why Diah retained the original Proclamation text in private possession for nearly half a century rather than immediately depositing it in national archives where it belonged. While defenders might argue he was protecting it, critics could contend this represented an inappropriate privatization of national heritage that served Diah's personal prestige while denying historians and the public access to this crucial document for decades.

Some observers note the inconsistency between Diah's fierce nationalism and Sukarnoist convictions in 1965-1966 and his subsequent service in the government that overthrew Sukarno. While political evolution is natural, the speed and completeness of Diah's accommodation with the New Order raises questions about the depth of his earlier convictions or the extent of political pressure and co-optation he faced.

Finally, critics of Indonesian journalism during the New Order period note that prominent journalists like Diah, who accepted honors and positions from the regime, contributed to a culture of press subservience that weakened Indonesia's democratic institutions and enabled decades of corruption and human rights abuses to continue with inadequate media scrutiny.
