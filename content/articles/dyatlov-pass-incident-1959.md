## Summary

The Dyatlov Pass incident is perhaps the most famous unsolved mystery of the 20th century. On the night of February 2, 1959, nine experienced Soviet hikers died in the northern Ural Mountains under bizarre and terrifying circumstances.

Investigators found their tent cut open from the **inside**, suggesting they fled in a panic without proper clothing in -30°C weather. Their bodies were found scattered down the slope: some died of hypothermia, while others had fatal injuries comparable to a car crash (crushed chests, fractured skulls) but with no external signs of violence. One victim was missing her tongue and eyes. Traces of **radiation** were found on their clothes, and the official Soviet conclusion was that they died of a **"compelling natural force."**[^1]

## The Incident

### The Group
Led by **Igor Dyatlov** (23), the group consisted of 9 students/graduates from the Ural Polytechnical Institute. They were highly experienced Grade II hikers aiming for Grade III certification.

### The Timeline
*   **Feb 1:** The group sets up camp on the slope of *Kholat Syakhl* ("Dead Mountain" in Mansi).
*   **Feb 2 (Night):** Something causes them to cut their tent open and flee into the dark forest, 1.5km away, wearing only socks or underwear.
*   **Feb 26:** Search parties find the abandoned tent.
*   **May 4:** The last four bodies are found deep in a ravine under 4 meters of snow.

## The Weirdness

*   **The Injuries:**
    *   **Nikolai Thibeaux-Brignolles:** Majors skull damage.
    *   **Lyudmila Dubinina:** Missing tongue, eyes, part of lip, facial tissue; crushed chest.
    *   **Semyon Zolotaryov:** Crushed chest; missing eyes.
    *   *Note:* Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny stated the force required was like a high-speed vehicle impact, yet there were no bruises or cuts on the skin.
*   **Radiation:** Beta-radiation was detected on the clothes of two hikers.
*   **The Lights:** Another group of hikers 50km away reported seeing "strange orange spheres" in the sky over Kholat Syakhl that night.
*   **Skin Color:** Witnesses at the funerals claimed the bodies had deeply tanned, orange-ish skin.[^2]

## Theories

### Slab Avalanche (Scientific)
A 2021 study by Swiss researchers (using Disney's *Frozen* snow animation code) suggests a small, delayed slab avalanche buried the tent. The injuries in the ravine were caused by the weight of snow or falling into the ravine later.
*   *Critique:* The slope was not steep enough (only ~30 degrees), and the "cut from inside" panic seems extreme for a slow-moving snow slide.

### Infrasound (Panic)
The shape of the mountain and high winds could create a **Kármán vortex street**, generating infrasound that causes irrational terror and physical discomfort in humans.[^3]

### Military Test / Parachute Mines
The radiation and "orange spheres" suggest a Soviet weapon test gone wrong (e.g., parachute mines exploding in the air). The "compelling force" verdict was a way to classify the secret.

### Paradoxical Undressing
Hypothermia can cause victims to feel irrationally hot, leading them to strip off clothes before freezing to death. This explains the state of undress but not the trauma.

### The Yeti / Mansi
Early theories blamed the indigenous Mansi people or a "Menk" (Yeti), but no footprints other than the hikers' were found.[^4]
