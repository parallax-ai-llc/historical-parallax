## Summary

Uichiro Nakaya was a Japanese physicist who was the first person to create artificial snow crystals in a laboratory in 1936. He systematically classified natural snow crystals and showed that crystal shapes depend on temperature and humidity conditions. His Nakaya diagram remains the standard classification system for snow crystal morphology.
