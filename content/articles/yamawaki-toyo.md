## Summary

Yamawaki Toyo was a Japanese physician who performed the first officially sanctioned human dissection in Japan in 1754, challenging the traditional Chinese anatomical descriptions used in Japanese medicine. His observations, published in Zoshi (Record of Organs), showed that actual human anatomy differed from classical Chinese texts, advancing empirical medicine in Japan.
