## Summary

The **Bengal Famine of 1943** was one of the deadliest famines in history, claiming the lives of an estimated **2.1 to 3.8 million people** in British India. Unlike typical famines caused by drought, this catastrophe was primarily "man-made"—the result of wartime inflation, panic hoarding, and specifically, British colonial policies. Fears of a Japanese invasion led to the implementation of "scorched earth" tactics (Denial Policies) that destroyed the local economy's transport and food reserves. Despite pleas from officials on the ground, Prime Minister **Winston Churchill**'s War Cabinet refused to divert shipping for relief, exacerbating the death toll.

## Economic and Military Context

### The Fall of Burma
In 1942, Imperial Japan conquered Burma (Myanmar). This had two devastating effects:
1.  **Rice Imports Cut:** Bengal lost its primary source of imported rice (about 15% of its consumption).
2.  **Refugee Crisis:** Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled Burma into Bengal, straining resources.

### The "Denial Policy"
Fearing the Japanese would invade Bengal next, the British administration implemented a scorched earth strategy to deny resources to the enemy. This policy, advocated by the military, proved fatal for the Bengali peasantry.
*   **Rice Denial:** Surplus rice was forcibly removed from coastal districts (Midnapore, Khulna, etc.) by official agents. This broke the local market's confidence and triggered hoarding.
*   **Boat Denial:** The military confiscated or destroyed over **46,000 boats** (country boats) capable of carrying more than 10 people. In a riverine delta like Bengal, boats were the lifeblood of the economy—used for fishing, transport, and trade. This policy paralyzed the food distribution network and destroyed the livelihoods of the poorest classes.

## Causes of Starvation

### Inflation and Greed
The financing of the war effort (printing money) caused rampant inflation. Rice prices skyrocketed by over 300% in a few months.
*   **Entitlement Failure:** Economist **Amartya Sen** famously analyzed this famine, concluding it was not caused by a severe lack of food availability (FAD), but by a **failure of exchange entitlements**. There was rice in Bengal, but the landless laborers, fishermen, and transport workers saw their wages stagnate while prices tripled, making food mathematically impossible to buy.
*   **Hoarding:** Wealthy landlords (jotedars) and traders hoarded grain, anticipating even higher prices, while the government failed to enforce price controls.

### The Scene in Calcutta
By May 1943, starvation had driven rural populations into Calcutta. Eyewitnesses described horrific scenes:
*   "Skeletons" walking the streets, begging for "finer water" (rice water).
*   Mothers selling their children or watching them die on pavements.
*   Corpses were piled onto trucks daily. The authorities struggled to dispose of bodies, leading to outbreaks of cholera, smallpox, and malaria, which killed as many as starvation itself.

## Churchill's Role and British Response

The response from London remains a subject of intense historical condemnation.

### Refusal of Shipping
The Viceroy of India, **Lord Linlithgow**, and the Secretary of State for India, **Leopold Amery**, sent urgent telegrams to London requesting wheat imports to stabilize prices and feed the population.
*   **The War Cabinet's Decision:** Relieving the famine required diverting merchant ships. The War Cabinet, led by **Winston Churchill**, repeatedly turned down these requests, citing a shortage of shipping due to the U-boat war and the upcoming invasion of Europe (D-Day preparations).
*   **Stockpiles:** At the same time, ships carrying Australian wheat sailed past India to the Mediterranean and the UK, where stockpiles were being built up for post-war Europe.

### Racist Rationale
Churchill's personal prejudice against Indians influenced these decisions.
*   In War Cabinet meetings, he blamed the famine on Indians "breeding like rabbits."
*   When informed of the death toll, he callously asked, "Why hasn't Gandhi died yet?"
*   Leopold Amery later wrote in his diary: "Winston may be right in saying that the starvation of anyhow under-fed Bengalis is less serious than that of sturdy Greeks, but he makes no sufficient allowance for the sense of Empire responsibility."

## Relief and Aftermath

### The Arrival of Wavell
In October 1943, **Field Marshal Archibald Wavell** replaced Linlithgow as Viceroy. Wavell immediately mobilized the army to take control of relief operations. The military moved grain to rural areas, distributed medicine, and engineered the movement of supplies, which gradually brought the famine under control by 1944.

### The Famine Inquiry Commission (1945)
A commission led by Sir John Woodhead investigated the disaster. While it avoided directly blaming London, it heavily criticized the provincial government of Bengal for incompetence and corruption. It confirmed that the "boat denial" policy had completely broken the economy.

### Legacy
The Bengal Famine shattered the moral legitimacy of the British Raj. It proved to the Indian public that the colonial government would sacrifice Indian lives for British strategic interests. The memory of 1943 fueled the final push for independence, which was achieved in 1947, though it also left the region economically devastated for decades.
