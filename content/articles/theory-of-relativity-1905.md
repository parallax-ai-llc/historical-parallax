## Overview

Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity is the most famous scientific theory in history, fundamentally changing our understanding of the universe. It consists of two parts: **Special Relativity** (1905), which introduced $E=mc^2$ and the speed of light limit; and **General Relativity** (1915), which explained gravity not as a force, but as the curvature of space-time. Before Einstein, Isaac Newton's laws ruled physics for 200 years. Einstein showed that space and time are not absolute but relative to the observer. His work enabled GPS, nuclear power, and our understanding of black holes and the Big Bang.

## Background

### The Problem with Light

**Newton's Universe:**
Space and time are absolute containers. Clocks tick the same everywhere.

**Maxwell's Equations:**
Showed light travels at a constant speed ($c$).

**The Conflict:**
If you chase a beam of light at the speed of light, what do you see? Stationary light? Maxwell said impossible. Newton said possible. Physics was broken.

**Albert Einstein (1905):**
26-year-old patent clerk in Bern, Switzerland. Unknown.

## Special Relativity (1905)

### The "Miracle Year"

In 1905 (*Annus Mirabilis*), Einstein published four papers:
1.  Photoelectric Effect (Nobel Prize)
2.  Brownian Motion (proved atoms exist)
3.  **Special Relativity** ("On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies")
4.  **Mass-Energy Equivalence** ($E=mc^2$)

### Key Concepts

**1. Speed of Light is Constant:**
No matter how fast you move, light always passes you at $c$ (186,000 miles/sec).

**2. Time Dilation:**
Time slows down the faster you move. A moving clock ticks slower than a stationary one.

**3. Length Contraction:**
Objects shorten in the direction of motion as they approach light speed.

**4. $E=mc^2$:**
Energy and Mass are interchangeable. A small amount of mass can be converted into a huge amount of energy (basis for nuclear bombs/power).

## General Relativity (1915)

### The "Happiest Thought"

Special Relativity only worked for constant speed (no gravity). Einstein spent 10 years trying to include gravity.
His insight: **Falling freely feels like floating (weightlessness).** Gravity and acceleration are equivalent.

### Spacetime Curvature

**Newton:** Gravity is a force pulling things.
**Einstein:** Gravity is the **curvature of space and time** caused by mass.

**Analogy:**
Put a bowling ball on a trampoline. It curves the fabric. A marble rolled nearby follows the curve.
The Sun curves spacetime; Earth follows the curve (orbit).

### Publishing (November 1915)

Presented to Prussian Academy of Sciences. The math was incredibly complex (tensors).

## Proof

### The Solar Eclipse (1919)

**Prediction:**
Starlight passing near the Sun should bend due to gravity.

**Arthur Eddington:**
British astronomer led expedition to Africa/Brazil during eclipse to measure star positions.

**Result:**
Light bent exactly as Einstein predicted. Newton was wrong.

**New York Times Headline:**
> "LIGHTS ALL ASKEW IN THE HEAVENS... EINSTEIN THEORY TRIUMPHS"

Einstein became overnight global celebrity.

## Implications

### GPS (Global Positioning System)

Relativity is real. GPS satellites move fast (Special Relativity: time slows 7 microseconds/day) and are far from Earth's gravity (General Relativity: time speeds up 45 microseconds/day).
Net difference: 38 microseconds/day.
**Without Einstein's corrections, GPS would be off by miles within one day.**

### Black Holes

Predicted by relativity (points of infinite curvature). Einstein didn't believe they existed physically. Now confirmed (Event Horizon Telescope).

### Cosmology

Expanding Universe, Big Bang, Gravitational Waves (detected 2015).

## Einstein the Icon

**Refugee:**
Jewish. Fled Nazi Germany 1933. Moved to Princeton, USA.

**Pacifist vs. The Bomb:**
Signed letter to FDR (1939) warning Germans might build A-bomb. Led to Manhattan Project. Einstein never worked on it; horrified by Hiroshima.

**Brain:**
Stolen after autopsy. Studied for decades.

## Legacy

"Newton, forgive me," wrote Einstein. He didn't destroy physics; he expanded it. Relativistic effects only matter at high speeds or massive gravity. For everyday life, Newton works fine. But for the universe, Einstein rules.
