## Summary

Giovanni Alfonso Borelli founded biomechanics by applying physics and mathematics to the study of animal movement. His posthumous masterwork De Motu Animalium (1680-81) analyzed muscle action, bird flight, fish swimming, and blood circulation as mechanical phenomena. He is considered the father of biomechanics.
