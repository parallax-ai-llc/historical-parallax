## Summary

Ramana Maharshi was a South Indian sage who experienced spontaneous self-realization at age 16 and spent the rest of his life at Tiruvannamalai. He taught the direct path of Self-inquiry through the question 'Who am I?' He attracted seekers from around the world, including Paul Brunton, who introduced him to Western audiences. His silent presence was considered as powerful as his teachings.
