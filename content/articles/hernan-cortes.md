## Summary

Hernán Cortés (1485-1547) was a Spanish conquistador who led the expedition that caused the fall of the Aztec Empire and brought large portions of what is now mainland Mexico under the rule of the King of Castile in the early 16th century. His conquest of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan in 1521 marked one of the most significant events in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Cortés's legacy remains deeply controversial, celebrated by some as a brilliant military strategist and vilified by others as a ruthless destroyer of indigenous civilizations. His actions set the template for Spanish colonial expansion in the Americas and profoundly shaped the demographic, cultural, and political landscape of Mexico for centuries to come.

## Early Life and Background

Hernán Cortés was born in 1485 in Medellín, a town in the province of Extremadura in western Spain, to a family of minor nobility.[^1] His parents, Martín Cortés de Monroy and Catalina Pizarro Altamirano, were of modest means despite their hidalgo status, which granted them noble privileges but little wealth. The region of Extremadura was known for producing many of Spain's most famous conquistadors, likely due to its poverty and lack of economic opportunities, which drove young men to seek their fortunes overseas.[^2]

As a child, Cortés was reportedly sickly and frail, though he would later develop into a robust and energetic young man. At the age of fourteen, his parents sent him to the University of Salamanca to study law, hoping he would pursue a career in the legal profession.[^3] However, Cortés found academic life tedious and left the university after only two years, much to his parents' disappointment. Contemporary accounts describe him as restless, ambitious, and eager for adventure rather than scholarly pursuits.

Returning to Medellín around 1501, Cortés briefly considered joining military expeditions to Italy, where Spain was engaged in various conflicts. However, he ultimately decided to seek his fortune in the New World, inspired by tales of Christopher Columbus's discoveries and the opportunities for wealth and glory that the Americas promised.[^4] In 1504, at the age of nineteen, Cortés sailed to Hispaniola (present-day Haiti and Dominican Republic), arriving in the colony of Santo Domingo. This decision would set him on a path that would alter the course of world history.

During his early years in the Caribbean, Cortés worked as a notary and farmer, receiving an encomienda (a grant of land and indigenous laborers) in recognition of his services to the colonial government. He participated in the conquest of Cuba under Diego Velázquez in 1511, where he distinguished himself as a capable administrator and gained valuable experience in colonial warfare and politics.[^5] These formative years in the Caribbean provided Cortés with insights into indigenous societies, military tactics, and the workings of Spanish colonial administration that would prove crucial in his later conquest of Mexico.

## Rise to Power

Cortés's opportunity for greatness came in 1518 when Diego Velázquez, now governor of Cuba, selected him to lead an expedition to explore and trade with the recently discovered lands of Mexico.[^6] Previous expeditions led by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba and Juan de Grijalva had returned with reports of wealthy civilizations and gold, sparking Spanish interest in the region. Velázquez chose Cortés for his administrative abilities and connections, but soon grew suspicious of his ambitious subordinate's intentions.

Sensing that Velázquez might revoke his commission, Cortés accelerated his preparations and departed from Santiago de Cuba in February 1519 with eleven ships, approximately 500 soldiers, 100 sailors, and several horses—animals previously unknown to the indigenous peoples of the Americas.[^7] This hasty departure effectively made Cortés's expedition unauthorized, though he would later claim direct authority from King Charles I of Spain, bypassing Velázquez's authority entirely.

Upon arriving on the coast of Mexico, Cortés demonstrated the political acumen that would characterize his conquest. He founded the settlement of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz (present-day Veracruz) and established a town council that formally elected him as captain-general and chief justice, giving his expedition a legal foundation independent of Velázquez.[^8] In a bold move to prevent his men from deserting, Cortés ordered his ships scuttled, eliminating any possibility of retreat and forcing his expedition to move forward.

Cortés proved to be a masterful diplomat and strategist in dealing with indigenous groups. He quickly recognized the political fragmentation of Mesoamerica and the deep resentment many indigenous peoples harbored toward the dominant Aztec Empire, which extracted heavy tribute from subject peoples.[^9] His alliance with the Totonacs, who resented Aztec rule, provided him with additional troops and crucial intelligence about the political landscape of central Mexico.

The acquisition of Doña Marina (La Malinche), an indigenous woman who became his translator, cultural interpreter, and later his mistress, proved invaluable to Cortés's success.[^10] Through her linguistic skills—she spoke both Nahuatl (the Aztec language) and Maya—and cultural knowledge, Cortés could communicate effectively with indigenous leaders and navigate the complex political dynamics of Mesoamerican society. Her role was so significant that some indigenous accounts of the conquest referred to Cortés himself as "Malinche."

Cortés's march to Tenochtitlan, the Aztec capital, showcased his ability to combine diplomacy, psychological warfare, and military force. His passage through Tlaxcala, a fierce rival of the Aztecs, resulted in initial conflict followed by a crucial alliance that provided him with thousands of indigenous warriors.[^11] This pattern of forming alliances with the Aztecs' enemies became central to Cortés's strategy, transforming his small Spanish force into a formidable coalition army.

## Major Achievements

Cortés's conquest of the Aztec Empire stands as one of the most remarkable military campaigns in history, not only for its audacity but for the profound consequences it had on world history.[^12] His expedition culminated in the fall of Tenochtitlan in August 1521, ending the Aztec Empire and establishing Spanish dominance over central Mexico. This achievement was accomplished through a combination of military skill, political maneuvering, technological advantages, and exploitation of existing indigenous conflicts.

The initial encounter with the Aztec emperor Moctezuma II in November 1519 demonstrated Cortés's boldness and tactical brilliance. Rather than confronting the Aztecs in open battle outside their capital, Cortés accepted Moctezuma's invitation to enter Tenochtitlan, a city of approximately 200,000 inhabitants built on an island in Lake Texcoco.[^13] Once inside, he took the audacious step of placing Moctezuma under house arrest, effectively holding the emperor hostage while continuing to receive tribute and maintain a façade of normal governance.

This delicate situation collapsed in 1520 during the Toxcatl massacre, when Cortés's deputy Pedro de Alvarado ordered an attack on Aztec nobles during a religious ceremony, killing hundreds.[^14] The resulting indigenous uprising forced the Spanish to flee Tenochtitlan during the infamous "Noche Triste" (Night of Sorrows) on June 30, 1520, during which they suffered heavy casualties and lost much of their treasure. This defeat would have ended most military campaigns, but Cortés demonstrated remarkable resilience and strategic thinking in his response.

Regrouping in Tlaxcala, Cortés spent nearly a year rebuilding his forces, forging stronger alliances with indigenous groups, and preparing for a siege of Tenochtitlan.[^15] He demonstrated innovative military engineering by constructing thirteen brigantines (small sailing vessels) that could be assembled on Lake Texcoco, giving the Spanish control of the waterways surrounding the island city. This naval component proved crucial in cutting off Tenochtitlan's supplies and preventing Aztec reinforcements.

The siege of Tenochtitlan, lasting from May to August 1521, was a brutal affair that resulted in massive loss of life, estimated at over 100,000 Aztec deaths from combat, starvation, and disease.[^16] Cortés's forces systematically destroyed the city, filling in canals and demolishing buildings as they advanced. The fall of Tenochtitlan on August 13, 1521, marked the effective end of the Aztec Empire, though sporadic resistance continued for years.

Following the conquest, Cortés demonstrated considerable administrative ability in establishing Spanish control over the vast territory that would become New Spain (colonial Mexico). He organized expeditions to explore and subdue other regions of Mexico and Central America, sending his lieutenants to extend Spanish authority to Guatemala, Honduras, and beyond.[^17] His vision extended beyond mere military conquest to the establishment of a functioning colonial economy and society.

Cortés oversaw the reconstruction of Tenochtitlan, renamed Mexico City, as the capital of New Spain, building it atop the ruins of the Aztec capital in a symbolic assertion of Spanish dominance.[^18] He initiated the encomienda system in central Mexico, distributing indigenous labor among Spanish settlers, and encouraged the importation of European crops, livestock, and agricultural techniques. His efforts to promote mining, particularly silver extraction, laid the foundation for the colonial economy that would enrich Spain for centuries.

He also demonstrated some interest in protecting aspects of indigenous society and culture, though this was motivated primarily by pragmatic concerns about maintaining productive colonial subjects rather than humanitarian principles.[^19] Cortés opposed the complete enslavement of indigenous peoples, arguing that they would be more valuable as tribute-paying subjects, and he supported the work of Franciscan missionaries in converting indigenous populations to Christianity, seeing this as essential to Spanish colonial legitimacy.

Cortés was granted the title of Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca by King Charles I in 1529, along with a vast estate of over 20,000 square miles and dominion over approximately 23,000 indigenous tributaries, making him one of the wealthiest and most powerful men in the Spanish Empire.[^20] Despite being denied the formal position of viceroy of New Spain, which went to Antonio de Mendoza in 1535, Cortés's achievements in expanding Spanish territory and wealth were officially recognized and rewarded.

## Controversies and Criticisms

The conquest led by Hernán Cortés resulted in one of the greatest demographic catastrophes in human history. The indigenous population of central Mexico, estimated at between 15 to 25 million before the Spanish arrival, plummeted to approximately 1 to 2 million by the end of the 16th century.[^21] While European diseases, particularly smallpox, were the primary cause of this demographic collapse, the violence, forced labor, and social disruption brought by the conquest contributed significantly to this unprecedented loss of life.

Cortés's methods during the conquest were often brutal and ruthless. The massacre at Cholula in October 1519, where Spanish forces and their Tlaxcalan allies killed thousands of unarmed Cholulans, remains one of the most controversial episodes of the conquest.[^22] Cortés claimed he had discovered a plot to ambush his forces, though historical evidence for such a conspiracy remains disputed. The massacre served as a demonstration of Spanish military power and willingness to use extreme violence, terrorizing other indigenous groups into submission.

The destruction of Tenochtitlan during the 1521 siege represented not only a military victory but also a profound cultural catastrophe. One of the largest and most sophisticated cities in the world was systematically demolished, with its temples, palaces, libraries, and artworks destroyed or melted down for their precious metal content.[^23] Countless Aztec codices (painted books containing historical, astronomical, and cultural knowledge) were burned by Spanish authorities in subsequent years, resulting in an immeasurable loss of indigenous knowledge and cultural heritage.

Cortés's treatment of indigenous peoples, while sometimes pragmatic, ultimately reduced them to a subordinate status within the colonial system. The encomienda system he implemented in New Spain, though officially intended to provide protection and Christian instruction to indigenous people in exchange for labor and tribute, functioned in practice as a form of forced labor that led to widespread abuse and exploitation.[^24] Indigenous communities were uprooted, their traditional social structures disrupted, and their labor ruthlessly extracted for the benefit of Spanish colonizers.

His relationship with indigenous women, particularly Doña Marina (La Malinche), reflects the gendered violence and exploitation inherent in the conquest. While La Malinche was essential to Cortés's success and bore him a son, Martín Cortés, she was ultimately an enslaved woman with little agency in her situation.[^25] Cortés later abandoned her, arranging her marriage to one of his soldiers, Juan Jaramillo, and their son was sent to Spain. This personal relationship exemplifies the broader pattern of sexual exploitation of indigenous women that accompanied Spanish colonization.

Cortés's conflicts with other Spanish conquistadors and colonial authorities reveal his ruthless ambition and willingness to eliminate rivals. His expedition to Honduras in 1524-1526, ostensibly to pursue and punish his rebellious subordinate Cristóbal de Olid, was marked by extreme hardship and unnecessary loss of life among his followers.[^26] During this expedition, he ordered the execution of the last Aztec emperor, Cuauhtémoc, whom he had been holding captive, on dubious charges of conspiracy, eliminating a potential rival for indigenous loyalty.

His defiance of Diego Velázquez's authority and his questionable legal maneuvering to legitimize his expedition set a problematic precedent for conquistador behavior in the Americas. Cortés essentially conducted a private war of conquest, only seeking royal approval after the fact and presenting King Charles I with a fait accompli.[^27] This pattern of unauthorized conquest followed by appeals for royal recognition encouraged other conquistadors to pursue similarly aggressive and legally dubious expeditions.

Modern scholarship has increasingly emphasized that the conquest was not simply a Spanish achievement but rather the result of a civil war within indigenous Mexico, with Cortés skillfully exploiting existing conflicts and grievances.[^28] This perspective complicates the heroic narrative while also raising difficult questions about indigenous agency and collaboration. The fact that most of the fighting forces were indigenous allies rather than Spanish soldiers highlights the role of indigenous political decisions in determining the outcome of the conquest.

## Personal Life

Hernán Cortés married twice and had numerous children both within and outside of marriage, reflecting the complex sexual politics of the colonial period. His first marriage in 1515 to Catalina Suárez Marcaida, arranged while he was in Cuba, was reportedly unhappy and politically motivated.[^29] Catalina joined Cortés in Mexico in 1522, but she died under mysterious circumstances later that year, leading to rumors that Cortés had murdered her, though no conclusive evidence was ever produced.

His second marriage in 1529 to Juana de Zúñiga, a Spanish noblewoman and niece of the Duke of Béjar, was more strategic, connecting him to important noble families in Spain.[^30] This marriage produced four legitimate children: Martín (named after Cortés's father), María, Catalina, and Juana. Cortés was reportedly a devoted father to his legitimate children and took considerable care in arranging advantageous marriages for his daughters to consolidate his family's position in Spanish nobility.

Beyond his legitimate children, Cortés acknowledged several children born to indigenous and Spanish women. Most notably, his son Martín Cortés, born to Doña Marina in 1522, was legitimized by papal decree and raised alongside his legitimate half-siblings.[^31] He also had a daughter, María, with another indigenous woman, and possibly other children whose identities are less certain. His willingness to acknowledge and provide for his illegitimate children was unusual for the period and suggests a certain pragmatism in his personal relationships.

Contemporary descriptions of Cortés paint a picture of a charismatic but complex personality. Bernal Díaz del Castillo, a soldier who served under Cortés and later wrote an extensive history of the conquest, described him as being of medium height with a pale complexion, a somewhat bow-legged gait, and a powerful chest and shoulders.[^32] Díaz noted that Cortés was an eloquent speaker who could be charming and persuasive when he chose, but also calculating and ruthless when necessary.

Cortés cultivated an image of piety and religious devotion, regularly attending Mass and supporting missionary activities, though his religious observance appears to have coexisted comfortably with his ruthless pursuit of wealth and power.[^33] He often invoked divine providence in explaining his conquests, portraying himself as an instrument of God's will in bringing Christianity to the Americas. This religious framework provided both personal justification and political legitimacy for his actions.

His later years were marked by frustration and legal battles. Despite his enormous wealth and noble title, Cortés never achieved the political authority he desired in New Spain. He returned to Spain in 1540, hoping to gain greater recognition and influence at the royal court, but found himself increasingly marginalized.[^34] He spent his final years pursuing legal claims against the Spanish crown for what he considered inadequate compensation for his services and dealing with debts accumulated from his various expeditions and lawsuits.

Cortés died on December 2, 1547, at the age of 62, in Castilleja de la Cuesta near Seville, Spain, while preparing to return to Mexico. He died somewhat embittered, feeling that his achievements had not been adequately recognized or rewarded by the Spanish crown.[^35] His will directed that his remains be returned to Mexico, which they eventually were, though they were moved multiple times over the following centuries, reflecting the changing attitudes toward his legacy.

## Legacy

Hernán Cortés occupies a uniquely contested position in historical memory, particularly in Mexico, where he is simultaneously a foundational figure in the nation's history and a symbol of colonial oppression and cultural destruction. His conquest of the Aztec Empire fundamentally transformed Mexico and initiated three centuries of Spanish colonial rule that shaped the nation's language, religion, culture, political institutions, and demographic composition.[^36] Modern Mexico is, in many ways, a product of the collision between European and indigenous civilizations that Cortés's conquest precipitated.

The demographic legacy of the conquest is staggering. The catastrophic population decline of indigenous peoples, combined with the arrival of African slaves and European settlers, created a mestizo (mixed-race) population that forms the majority of modern Mexico.[^37] This racial and cultural mixing, while often romanticized as Mexico's distinctive national character, originated in the violent colonial encounter that Cortés initiated. The Spanish language, Catholicism, and various cultural practices introduced during the conquest period remain central to Mexican national identity.

Cortés's conquest established patterns of land ownership, labor exploitation, and racial hierarchy that persisted long after Mexican independence in 1821. The encomienda system evolved into the hacienda system, which concentrated land ownership among a small elite and maintained indigenous and mestizo populations in conditions of poverty and limited rights well into the 20th century.[^38] The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) can be understood in part as an attempt to overturn these colonial legacies.

His legacy in Spain is equally complex. During the imperial period, Cortés was celebrated as a hero who expanded Spanish power and brought enormous wealth to the crown through the silver mines of Mexico.[^39] Streets, statues, and institutions were named in his honor. However, as Spain has grappled with its colonial past, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Cortés has become a more controversial figure, symbolizing both Spanish achievement and the violence of colonialism.

The "Black Legend" of Spanish colonialism, which emphasized Spanish cruelty and exploitation in the Americas, frequently focused on Cortés and other conquistadors as exemplars of colonial brutality. This narrative, promoted particularly by Spain's European rivals in the 16th through 18th centuries, shaped Anglo-American and European perceptions of the Spanish conquest for centuries.[^40] While the Black Legend often exaggerated or selectively emphasized Spanish cruelty while ignoring similar actions by other colonial powers, the core criticisms of the conquest's violence and destruction have been validated by historical research.

In Mexican national consciousness, Cortés occupies an ambiguous and often negative position. Unlike figures such as Miguel Hidalgo or Benito Juárez, who are celebrated as national heroes, Cortés represents conquest and oppression. His statues have been removed or vandalized, and his name rarely appears on streets or public buildings in Mexico.[^41] The site of his remains in Mexico City is unmarked and obscure, reflecting official ambivalence about commemorating the conquistador.

Paradoxically, Cortés is sometimes invoked in discussions of Mexican identity precisely because of the complexity he represents. The Mexican philosopher and writer Octavio Paz, in his influential essay "The Labyrinth of Solitude," explored how figures like Cortés and La Malinche symbolize the traumatic origins of Mexican mestizo identity, representing both violation and creation.[^42] This intellectual tradition grapples with Cortés as an inescapable part of Mexican history whose legacy must be understood rather than simply condemned or celebrated.

The 500th anniversary of Cortés's arrival in Mexico in 2019 reignited debates about his legacy. Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador demanded that Spain apologize for the abuses of the conquest, while Spanish officials responded that the conquest should be understood in its historical context and that both nations share a common heritage resulting from that period.[^43] This controversy demonstrates how Cortés remains a flashpoint in ongoing discussions about colonialism, historical responsibility, and national identity.

Cortés's military and political strategies have been studied by military historians and strategists for centuries. His ability to form alliances, exploit divisions among his enemies, and combine diplomacy with force has been analyzed as a case study in asymmetric warfare and coalition building.[^44] However, these strategic lessons are increasingly considered alongside the ethical questions raised by the conquest and its consequences.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and commentators who view Cortés more favorably emphasize his remarkable individual achievements, military genius, and role in creating the modern world. Hugh Thomas, in his comprehensive biography "Conquest: Montezuma, Cortés, and the Fall of Old Mexico," portrays Cortés as an exceptional figure whose intelligence, courage, and leadership enabled him to accomplish what seemed impossible: the conquest of a vast empire with only a handful of soldiers.[^45] Thomas and others in this tradition argue that Cortés must be understood within the context of 16th-century European culture and values, where conquest, religious conversion, and the pursuit of glory were considered legitimate and even noble pursuits.

Some scholars have emphasized Cortés's administrative capabilities and vision for New Spain. Matthew Restall and others note that Cortés was not merely a destroyer but also a builder who established the institutional foundations of colonial Mexico, including its capital city, legal system, and economic structure.[^46] His support for missionary activities and his complex relationship with indigenous peoples, which sometimes included attempts to protect them from the worst abuses of the encomienda system (however ineffective these efforts ultimately were), suggest a more nuanced figure than simple narratives of pure villainy allow.

Defenders of Cortés's reputation often point to the role of indigenous allies in the conquest, arguing that the fall of the Aztec Empire resulted not from Spanish military superiority alone but from a civil war within Mesoamerica that Cortés skillfully exploited. In this view, Cortés served as a catalyst for political changes that were already developing within indigenous society, where subject peoples deeply resented Aztec domination and taxation.[^47] The Tlaxcalans and other indigenous groups made calculated political decisions to ally with the Spanish, exercising their own agency rather than serving as passive victims.

Military historians have praised Cortés's strategic acumen, tactical flexibility, and ability to learn from defeats. His recovery from the disaster of the Noche Triste and his methodical preparation for the siege of Tenochtitlan demonstrate resilience and strategic thinking.[^48] His innovation in constructing brigantines to control Lake Texcoco and his systematic approach to siege warfare showed adaptability and engineering skill. These military accomplishments, viewed in isolation from their moral implications, represent significant achievements in the history of warfare.

Some interpretations emphasize that the demographic catastrophe that followed the conquest was primarily caused by disease rather than deliberate Spanish policy. While this in no way absolves the Spanish of responsibility for the violence and exploitation of the conquest and colonial period, it suggests a more complex causality than narratives that attribute all indigenous deaths directly to Spanish actions.[^49] In this view, Cortés and his contemporaries could not have anticipated the epidemiological consequences of their arrival in the Americas.

Contemporary indigenous accounts, particularly from Tlaxcala, sometimes portrayed Cortés in relatively favorable terms, seeing him as a liberator from Aztec oppression rather than as a conqueror.[^50] These perspectives, preserved in indigenous chronicles and legal documents, complicate simple narratives and suggest that indigenous peoples had diverse responses to the Spanish conquest based on their particular political circumstances and interests. However, these sources must be interpreted carefully, as many were produced in colonial contexts where favorable portrayals of the Spanish might yield political or economic advantages.

---

## Negative Views

Critical scholars and commentators emphasize that Cortés was fundamentally a violent conqueror whose actions initiated centuries of oppression, cultural destruction, and exploitation of indigenous peoples. The Mexican historian Miguel León-Portilla, in his influential work "The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico," centered indigenous perspectives on the conquest, revealing it as a catastrophic invasion that destroyed a sophisticated civilization.[^51] From this viewpoint, military genius and administrative capability cannot justify or offset the immense suffering and cultural loss that resulted from Cortés's actions.

Modern historians increasingly emphasize the structural violence of colonialism that Cortés inaugurated in Mexico. The encomienda system, racial hierarchies, land dispossession, and cultural suppression that characterized Spanish colonial rule created enduring patterns of inequality that persist in various forms to this day.[^52] Cortés was not merely a man of his time but an architect of systems designed to extract wealth and labor from colonized peoples, systems that proved remarkably durable and destructive over centuries.

The cultural destruction wrought by the conquest represents an incalculable loss to human heritage. The burning of Aztec codices, the destruction of temples and artworks, and the suppression of indigenous languages and religious practices eliminated entire systems of knowledge and cultural expression.[^53] While Cortés personally may not have been responsible for all these acts of cultural destruction, his conquest created the conditions that made them possible and established a colonial ideology that devalued indigenous culture and knowledge.

Scholars working in postcolonial and decolonial frameworks argue that celebrating or even neutrally assessing Cortés implicitly endorses colonial violence and perpetuates harmful narratives about indigenous peoples. Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and other scholars argue that figures like Cortés should be understood primarily as perpetrators of genocide, a term that accurately describes the near-total destruction of indigenous populations and cultures in central Mexico.[^54] From this perspective, focusing on Cortés's military skill or administrative ability distracts from the fundamental moral questions his actions raise.

Indigenous scholars and activists often emphasize that the conquest was not a historical event confined to the past but rather the beginning of an ongoing process of colonization that continues to affect indigenous peoples today. The poverty, marginalization, and cultural suppression experienced by indigenous communities in Mexico and throughout the Americas have direct historical connections to the colonial systems that Cortés and his contemporaries established.[^55] In this view, Cortés represents not historical curiosity but a living legacy of oppression.

Feminist scholars have highlighted the gendered violence of the conquest, with sexual exploitation of indigenous women serving as both a literal and symbolic aspect of colonial domination. Cortés's relationship with La Malinche, however pragmatic or even affectionate it may have been, was fundamentally structured by profound power imbalances.[^56] The broader pattern of Spanish men taking indigenous women as concubines or slaves was a form of systematic sexual violence that accompanied military conquest.

Critics argue that contextualizing Cortés within 16th-century values is insufficient, as even by the standards of his own time, his actions were controversial. Bartolomé de las Casas, a Spanish Dominican friar and contemporary of Cortés, vigorously condemned the conquest and the treatment of indigenous peoples, demonstrating that ethical criticism of colonialism existed within Spanish society itself.[^57] The fact that some Spaniards recognized and opposed the injustices of conquest undermines arguments that Cortés should be excused based on the values of his era.

Recent scholarship has also questioned narratives that emphasize indigenous agency in the conquest, arguing that these can inadvertently shift responsibility for the conquest's consequences away from Spanish colonizers.[^58] While indigenous groups certainly made strategic decisions in response to Spanish arrival, they could not have anticipated the long-term consequences of these choices, including demographic collapse, cultural destruction, and centuries of colonial rule. Emphasizing indigenous participation in the conquest, critics argue, can implicitly blame victims for their own oppression.
