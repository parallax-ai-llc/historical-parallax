## Summary

Somdej Toh (1788–1872), formally known as Somdet Phra Buddhacarya (To Brahmaramsi), was one of the most famous and revered Buddhist monks during Thailand's Rattanakosin period.[^1] Born as the alleged illegitimate son of King Rama II, he rose to become abbot of Wat Rakang Kositaram and preceptor to Prince Mongkut, who later became King Rama IV.[^2] Renowned for his profound Buddhist scholarship, exceptional preaching abilities using Thai poetry, and the creation of the legendary Phra Somdej amulets, he remains the most widely venerated saintly monk in Thailand more than 150 years after his death.[^3] His spiritual legacy includes the preservation of ancient Buddhist texts, construction of numerous temples and Buddha statues, and a reputation for supernatural powers that continues to inspire millions of devotees.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Somdej Toh was born on the morning of April 17, 1788 (Buddhist Era 2331) in Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province during the early Rattanakosin period of Siamese history.[^5] The circumstances of his birth remain shrouded in historical ambiguity, with multiple accounts of his parentage. The most widely accepted tradition holds that he was the illegitimate son of King Rama II, though some sources suggest he may have been an unacknowledged son of King Rama I.[^6] Other accounts claim he was born in Kamphaeng Phet Province to a family of modest means.[^7] This mystery surrounding his royal lineage would follow him throughout his life, though it never seemed to affect his spiritual pursuits or humble demeanor.

Before his ordination, the boy was simply known as "Toh," a common Thai name.[^8] Around the age of five to seven, young Toh entered Wat Indrawiharn (also known as Wat Bangkhunprom) in the Bangkhunprom district of Bangkok, where he began his initial education.[^9] There he studied under the tutelage of Chao Khun Ariyavongsayan, a highly respected scholar-monk known for his expertise in Buddhist scriptures and Pali language.[^10] This early education provided Toh with a strong foundation in Buddhist philosophy and the monastic disciplines that would shape his entire life.

The young student demonstrated exceptional aptitude for religious studies, memorizing Pali verses and Buddhist sutras with remarkable speed and comprehension.[^11] His teachers recognized his potential early on, noting his sincere devotion to the Dharma and his natural ability to understand complex Buddhist doctrines. At the age of twelve in 1800 (BE 2343), Toh was ordained as a novice monk (samanera) at Wat Nibbanaram, taking his first formal steps on the monastic path.[^12] This ordination marked the beginning of what would become a seventy-two year dedication to Buddhist monasticism.

As a novice, Toh immersed himself in the study of the Pali Canon, learning from several Buddhist masters across different temples in Bangkok and surrounding provinces.[^13] He traveled to various monasteries to receive instruction from renowned scholars, absorbing knowledge of Buddhist philosophy, Vinaya (monastic discipline), meditation practices, and the esoteric traditions that were part of Thai Buddhist practice.[^14] His rigorous training included not only the Theravada Buddhist scriptures but also elements of Khmer and Lao magical arts, which were considered complementary to Buddhist practice in the Siamese cultural context.[^15]

## Rise to Power

At the age of twenty in 1808 (BE 2350), Toh received his full ordination (upasampada) as a bhikkhu (fully ordained monk) at Wat Praseeratanasasadaram, also known as Wat Phra Kaeo, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, under royal patronage.[^16] His ordination name became "Phromarangsi" (Brahmaramsi), meaning "one who delights in the Brahma realms."[^17] This prestigious ordination location, adjacent to the Grand Palace and the most sacred temple in Siam, indicated the respect and recognition he had already garnered despite his youth.

Following his ordination, Toh continued his intensive studies of Buddhist texts and began to develop a reputation as an exceptional scholar and teacher.[^18] His mastery of the Pali language allowed him to access the original Buddhist scriptures directly, and his ability to convey complex teachings in accessible Thai poetry made him increasingly popular among both monastic and lay communities.[^19] He was noted particularly for his skill in preaching, using elegant Thai verse to reflect the beauty and profundity of Buddhist teachings in a way that resonated deeply with Thai cultural sensibilities.[^20]

The turning point in Somdej Toh's ecclesiastical career came when he was selected to serve as one of the preceptors for Prince Mongkut, a son of King Rama II, when the prince entered monastic life.[^21] This relationship between teacher and royal student would prove pivotal for both men. Prince Mongkut spent twenty-seven years as a monk (from 1824 to 1851) before ascending to the throne as King Rama IV, and during this period, Somdej Toh served as one of his key instructors in advanced Dharma and Vinaya.[^22] The two developed a relationship of mutual respect and intellectual exchange that would continue even after Mongkut's coronation.[^23]

When Prince Mongkut founded the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, a reform movement within Thai Buddhism that emphasized strict adherence to Vinaya rules and a return to the Pali Canon, Somdej Toh supported these efforts while remaining within the Maha Nikaya, the larger traditional order.[^24] This demonstrated his ability to bridge different factions within the sangha and maintain respectful relationships across sectarian lines. His reputation for wisdom, compassion, and strict moral discipline earned him the deep respect of both the royal family and the common people.[^25]

In 1852 (BE 2395), when Somdej Toh was sixty-five years old, King Rama IV appointed him as the sixth abbot of Wat Rakang Kositaram, one of the most important royal temples in Bangkok, located on the Thonburi side of the Chao Phraya River.[^26] Along with this appointment, he received his first official ecclesiastical title, "Phra Thammakiti."[^27] This marked the formal recognition of his spiritual attainments and his elevation to the highest echelons of the Thai Buddhist monastic hierarchy. Two years later in 1854 (BE 2397), he was promoted to the title "Phra Thep Krawee."[^28]

The pinnacle of his ecclesiastical career came in 1864 (BE 2407) when King Rama IV conferred upon him the exalted title of "Somdej Phra Phutthachan," the highest monastic rank in the kingdom, reflecting the monarch's high regard for his scholarly and spiritual contributions.[^29] The term "Somdej" (Supreme Patriarch rank) placed him among the most senior monks in Siam, while "Phutthachan" (Buddhist teacher) acknowledged his role as a preeminent instructor of the Dharma.[^30] From this point forward, he would be known as Somdej Toh, the name by which he is still revered today.

## Major Achievements

Somdej Toh's tenure as abbot of Wat Rakang Kositaram is widely regarded as a golden era for the temple, marked by his profound spiritual influence and tireless efforts to propagate Buddhism throughout the kingdom.[^31] His achievements spanned multiple domains: religious education, temple construction, preservation of Buddhist texts, creation of sacred objects, and spiritual guidance to people of all social classes.

### Buddhist Education and Teaching

As one of the most celebrated preachers of his time, Somdej Toh revolutionized Buddhist teaching in Siam through his innovative use of Thai poetry to convey Dharma.[^32] Rather than simply translating Pali texts literally, he composed elegant Thai verses that captured Buddhist concepts in language that resonated with Thai cultural aesthetics and made complex philosophical ideas accessible to ordinary people.[^33] His sermons attracted large crowds from all walks of life, from royalty to peasants, who were moved by his eloquent expression of Buddhist wisdom.[^34]

He served as preceptor and instructor to numerous monks and novices, establishing educational standards that influenced monastic training throughout the kingdom.[^35] According to scholarly analysis, "the importance of studying the educational role of Somdet Phra Buddhācāriya (Toh) is not only his path but also the collective historical result of early Rattanakosin monastic education."[^36] He was recognized as "the Buddha-Sāsanadayāda in early monastic education whose impact is in monastic education and in Thai society presently and in the future."[^37]

### Preservation of the Chinabanchorn Katha

One of Somdej Toh's most significant contributions to Thai Buddhism was his rediscovery and popularization of the Chinabanchorn Katha (also spelled Chinabanchon), a powerful Buddhist prayer text.[^38] According to tradition, while visiting relatives in Kamphaeng Phet Province, Somdej Toh visited the ancient Wat Sadet near the Ping River, where an old stupa containing Buddha relics had been excavated.[^39] Inside the stupa, an ancient grimoire (Kampir) written in Singhala script was discovered and given to Somdej Toh.[^40]

He took this ancient text back to his residence (guti) at Wat Rakang and studied it extensively.[^41] Recognizing its spiritual power but understanding that the archaic language made it inaccessible to contemporary practitioners, Somdej Toh edited and rewrote portions of the Katha, improving and simplifying it while preserving its essential meaning.[^42] The Chinabanchorn Katha is considered one of the most powerful Buddhist prayers because it invokes the blessings of the Buddha, numerous Arahants, and celestial beings.[^43] Somdej Toh used this Katha for ceremonial chanting, blessing amulets, meditation, and protection rituals.[^44] Today, more than 50 percent of Thai Buddhist devotees can recite portions of this Katha, demonstrating the enduring impact of his preservation work.[^45]

### Temple Construction and Buddha Images

Somdej Toh was a driving force behind the construction and restoration of numerous temples and Buddha images across Thailand, demonstrating his commitment to creating sacred spaces for Buddhist practice.[^46] His patronage and direct involvement extended to several major projects that remain important pilgrimage sites today.

Perhaps his most ambitious project was the massive standing Buddha image at Wat Intharawihan (also known as Wat Bangkhunprom Nai) in Bangkok.[^47] This colossal statue, standing 32 meters tall, was initiated in 1867 when Somdej Toh was already in his late seventies.[^48] Though he would not live to see its completion, his vision and fundraising efforts made the project possible. The statue remains one of the tallest Buddha images in Thailand and a testament to his devotion.

He also supervised the construction of the revered reclining Buddha at Wat Satoe in Ayutthaya Province and the large Buddha image at Wat Chaiyo in Ang Thong Province.[^49] Beyond these major projects, Somdej Toh contributed to the renovation and beautification of Wat Rakang Kositaram itself, ensuring that the temple remained a vibrant center of Buddhist practice and learning.[^50] These construction projects served multiple purposes: they provided objects of veneration for Buddhist practice, created employment for local communities, and established lasting monuments to the Dharma.

### Creation of Phra Somdej Amulets

Somdej Toh is perhaps most famous for creating the Phra Somdej amulets, which are considered the "king of amulets" in Thai Buddhist tradition and are among the most valuable and sought-after Buddhist sacred objects in the world.[^51] Between approximately 1866 and 1871, he created 84,000 of these amulets at Wat Rakang Kositaram.[^52] The amulets feature a Buddha image in meditation posture seated on a multi-tiered throne, executed in a distinctive artistic style that has become iconic in Thai amulet tradition.[^53]

The creation process was highly ritualized and spiritually charged. Somdej Toh prepared the sacred powder mixture himself, using ingredients that included sacred soil from holy sites, powdered herbs with spiritual significance, old amulets and scripture fragments, and according to tradition, even a small amount of his own blood to strengthen the spiritual connection.[^54] After molding the amulets, they underwent extensive consecration ceremonies involving powerful Buddhist chanting, particularly the Chinabanchorn Katha.[^55] The amulets were also blessed by other respected monks, creating what believers consider layers of spiritual power.[^56]

Somdej Toh's primary motivation in creating the Phra Somdej was deeply spiritual rather than commercial.[^57] He intended to provide a tangible spiritual anchor for people, guiding them toward virtuous actions and away from harmful ones, while encouraging prayer and adherence to the Noble Eightfold Path.[^58] The functions attributed to these amulets range from protection against physical dangers and black magic, to enhanced personal relationships, better health, career advancement, and general good fortune.[^59] Today, authentic Phra Somdej Wat Rakang amulets created by Somdej Toh are valued at millions of Thai baht, making them among the most expensive Buddhist amulets in existence.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Unlike many powerful historical figures, Somdej Toh's life is remarkably free from major scandals or widespread criticism, which itself speaks to his genuine virtue and careful conduct.[^61] However, several areas of controversy and criticism exist, both historical and contemporary.

### Criticism of Royal Conduct

While Somdej Toh generally maintained excellent relations with the royal family, there were instances where he courageously criticized royal behavior when he felt Buddhist principles were being violated.[^62] According to historical accounts documented by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, during a discussion of Buddhist texts about royal family customs, Somdej Toh continued reading: "Ever since then it's become a custom among royal families. Uncles go running after their nieces, cousins go running after their cousins..."[^63] This pointed criticism of what he viewed as inappropriate romantic relationships within the royal family resulted in his temporary banishment from the royal court.[^64]

Another famous incident involved King Rama IV's anger toward certain monks. When the king ordered these monks to be forcibly disrobed, Somdej Toh demonstrated his wisdom and courage by burning three holes in the royal decree and returning it with the message: "Put them out."[^65] The three holes symbolized the three fires of passion, anger, and delusion that the Buddha taught must be extinguished. Rather than being further angered, the king understood the profound teaching and withdrew his order.[^66] These incidents reveal that Somdej Toh was willing to speak truth to power when Buddhist principles were at stake, even at personal risk—a rare quality in any era, but particularly in absolute monarchy.

### Questions About Royal Lineage

The uncertainty surrounding Somdej Toh's parentage has led to historical debates about whether claims of royal ancestry were exaggerated or fabricated to enhance his prestige.[^67] Some scholars question whether he was truly the son of King Rama II or whether this tradition developed later to explain his close relationship with the royal family and rapid ecclesiastical advancement.[^68] However, given that he lived modestly and never appeared to exploit any royal connection for personal gain, these questions reflect more on historical record-keeping than on Somdej Toh's character.

### Commercialization and Amulet Market Controversies

The most significant modern controversy surrounding Somdej Toh relates not to his own actions but to the commercial exploitation of his legacy through the amulet market.[^69] The tremendous value of authentic Phra Somdej Wat Rakang amulets has spawned a massive industry of forgeries, replicas, and fraudulent authentication.[^70] According to one critical analysis: "Those with vested interests in the distortion and manipulation of historical fact, such as the main amulet societies, are losing their stranglehold, and where there is money, billions of Baht, there are those that wish to control and extort through the respectability of a self appointed hierarchy and authority."[^71]

This commercialization has led to several problems: unscrupulous dealers selling fake amulets as authentic pieces for enormous sums; authentication societies accused of bias and corruption; and the reduction of sacred religious objects to mere investment commodities.[^72] While Somdej Toh cannot be blamed for these developments occurring long after his death, some critics argue that the creation of such valuable objects inevitably leads to commercialization that contradicts Buddhist principles of non-attachment.[^73]

### Supernatural Claims and Rationalist Skepticism

Modern rationalist scholars and reformed Buddhists sometimes express skepticism about the miraculous stories associated with Somdej Toh, viewing them as hagiographic embellishments that obscure his genuine accomplishments.[^74] Critics argue that attributing supernatural powers to him—such as levitation, mind-reading, and exorcism—may actually diminish appreciation for his real achievements in education, scholarship, and religious reform.[^75] They contend that these legends reflect folk religious beliefs rather than the rational, philosophical Buddhism that Somdej Toh himself taught based on the Pali Canon.[^76]

However, defenders respond that such supernatural elements are deeply embedded in Thai Buddhist tradition and that dismissing them imposes Western rationalist frameworks onto Asian religious culture.[^77] They argue that whether the miracles literally occurred is less important than their function in conveying spiritual truths and inspiring faith in practitioners.[^78]

### Limited Social Reform

Some modern critics note that despite his influence and royal connections, Somdej Toh did not advocate for significant social reforms or challenge the hierarchical social structures of his time.[^79] His focus remained primarily on individual spiritual development rather than systemic social change. However, this criticism may be anachronistic, applying modern expectations of religious leaders to a 19th-century context where such activism was neither expected nor feasible within the Siamese political system.

## Personal Life

Despite his exalted ecclesiastical position, Somdej Toh was renowned for maintaining a humble and austere personal lifestyle that embodied the Buddhist ideals he preached.[^80] Contemporary accounts consistently describe him as approachable, compassionate, and entirely lacking in the arrogance that might accompany such high status.[^81] He maintained a modest residence (guti) at Wat Rakang Kositaram, where he devoted his time to meditation, study, teaching, and the creation of sacred objects.[^82]

### Character and Demeanor

Somdej Toh was celebrated for his frugal lifestyle and complete indifference toward fame or wealth, maintaining strict adherence to the Vinaya (monastic discipline) throughout his life.[^83] Despite his rank and connection to royalty, he was easily approachable to people on all levels of society, from the king to the poorest peasants.[^84] This accessibility was remarkable given the rigid social hierarchies of 19th-century Siam, where social distance between classes was typically maintained.

His humility manifested in practical ways. Historical accounts describe him paddling his own small boat across the Chao Phraya River rather than being rowed by attendants, a practice that once prompted King Rama IV to question why such a high-ranking monk performed menial labor himself.[^85] Somdej Toh's witty response—that when the king drinks in public, Somdets can paddle their own boats—both deflected the question with humor and gently reminded the king that they each had their own duties to perform regardless of rank.[^86]

### Daily Practice and Spiritual Discipline

Somdej Toh maintained a rigorous meditation practice and was known for long periods of deep concentration.[^87] He typically rose before dawn for meditation and chanting, followed by his alms round when he would walk through nearby neighborhoods receiving food offerings from lay devotees.[^88] These daily interactions provided opportunities for him to offer brief teachings and blessings to ordinary people, strengthening his connection with the lay community.[^89]

His spiritual practices included not only the standard Theravada meditation techniques but also the recitation of protective chants, particularly the Chinabanchorn Katha, which he would chant during his meditation sessions and when blessing amulets or consecrating sacred objects.[^90] This combination of meditation, scriptural study, teaching, and ritual practice characterized his daily routine for more than six decades as a monk.[^91]

### Relationships and Influence

As a celibate monk bound by Vinaya rules, Somdej Toh had no romantic relationships or family of his own after ordination.[^92] However, his relationship with his most famous student, King Rama IV, remained strong throughout both their lives.[^93] The king frequently consulted Somdej Toh on religious matters and sought his counsel on broader questions of governance and ethics.[^94] This relationship demonstrated Somdej Toh's ability to maintain both spiritual independence and respectful engagement with political power.

He also maintained close relationships with other leading monks of his era and was instrumental in training numerous students who would become influential teachers in their own right.[^95] His teaching lineage spread throughout Thailand as his students established themselves in temples across the kingdom.[^96] These spiritual descendants continued his methods of using Thai poetry in teaching and his emphasis on both meditation and scholarship.[^97]

### Health and Advanced Age

Somdej Toh lived to the remarkable age of eighty-four, unusual for his era, which was attributed by believers to his spiritual practices, disciplined lifestyle, and the merit he accumulated through his religious work.[^98] Even in his advanced years, he remained active in teaching, conducting ceremonies, and overseeing construction projects.[^99] His final years were spent continuing the work he had pursued throughout his life: teaching the Dharma, creating sacred objects, and supporting Buddhist institutions.[^100]

---

## Legacy

Somdej Toh's death on June 22, 1872 (BE 2415) marked the end of an era in Thai Buddhism, but his influence has only grown in the decades and centuries since.[^101] He passed away at age eighty-four, having spent sixty-four years as a monk and twenty years as abbot of Wat Rakang Kositaram.[^102] According to some accounts, he died while inspecting the construction of a Buddha statue at Phra Nakhon Khiri Royal Palace in Phetchaburi Province, literally working until his final moments.[^103]

### Enduring Veneration

More than 150 years after his death, Somdej Toh remains the most widely venerated saintly monk in Thailand.[^104] His images and statues are among the most popular religious icons in Bangkok and throughout the country.[^105] Devotees pray to his image, make offerings at his memorial sites, and invoke his name when seeking blessings or protection.[^106] His status has transcended that of a merely historical figure to become something closer to a folk saint or bodhisattva in popular Thai Buddhist practice.[^107]

The cult of veneration surrounding Somdej Toh includes annual ceremonies commemorating his birth and death, pilgrimages to Wat Rakang Kositaram where his relics and belongings are enshrined, and the continued practice of his teachings and the Chinabanchorn Katha he preserved.[^108] This sustained devotion reflects the deep impact he had on Thai religious culture and the enduring power of his spiritual legacy.[^109]

### Educational Influence

Somdej Toh's educational methods transformed Buddhist pedagogy in Thailand, establishing models that continue to influence monastic education today.[^110] His use of Thai poetry to teach Dharma demonstrated that Buddhist teachings could be conveyed in culturally resonant forms without losing philosophical depth.[^111] This synthesis of Pali canonical knowledge with Thai literary expression created a distinctively Thai approach to Buddhist education that balanced scriptural authority with cultural accessibility.[^112]

Modern monastic education in Thailand still reflects principles that Somdej Toh championed: combining meditation practice with scriptural study, maintaining strict Vinaya discipline while remaining engaged with lay society, and using skillful means to make Buddhist teachings relevant to contemporary practitioners.[^113] The scholarly work analyzing his educational role concludes that his impact extends "in monastic education and in Thai society presently and in the future."[^114]

### Amulet Tradition

The Phra Somdej amulets created by Somdej Toh established an entire genre of Thai Buddhist amulets and sparked a tradition of amulet creation and devotion that remains vibrant today.[^115] Countless monks since his time have created their own versions of Phra Somdej amulets, always acknowledging the original Phra Somdej Wat Rakang as the archetype and most powerful exemplar.[^116] The artistic style, symbolic elements, and consecration methods he established have been studied and replicated by generations of subsequent monk-craftsmen.[^117]

Beyond their religious function, these amulets have become significant cultural artifacts that connect contemporary Thai people with their Buddhist heritage.[^118] The practice of wearing Buddhist amulets, while existing before Somdej Toh, was greatly expanded and systematized through his example.[^119] Today, the amulet tradition is a distinctive feature of Thai Buddhism, distinguishing it from Buddhist practice in other Theravada countries.[^120]

### Material Legacy

In addition to his spiritual and educational legacy, Somdej Toh left behind numerous tangible monuments to his work.[^121] The temples and Buddha images he helped construct remain active sites of worship and pilgrimage.[^122] The massive Buddha at Wat Intharawihan, though completed after his death, stands as a testament to his vision and fundraising abilities.[^123] Wat Rakang Kositaram itself has been preserved as a historical site, with his personal belongings, writing materials, and the molds used to create the original Phra Somdej amulets displayed for devotees to venerate.[^124]

### Influence on Thai Buddhist Identity

Perhaps Somdej Toh's most significant legacy is his contribution to Thai Buddhist identity during a crucial period of modernization and Western contact.[^125] Living during the reigns of Rama II through Rama V, he witnessed and participated in Thailand's encounter with Western colonialism and modernity.[^126] His example demonstrated that Thai Buddhism could maintain its traditional practices and beliefs while adapting to new circumstances.[^127] His relationship with King Rama IV, who was himself a reformist monk before becoming king, showed how traditional Buddhism and modernizing impulses could coexist.[^128]

In this sense, Somdej Toh became a symbol of Thai Buddhist authenticity and continuity, representing a golden age of Thai Buddhism that subsequent generations could look back to with pride.[^129] His life story—rising from uncertain origins to the highest ecclesiastical rank through merit and wisdom rather than political manipulation—embodied Buddhist principles and Thai cultural values simultaneously.[^130]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments of Somdej Toh are overwhelmingly positive, with most historians and religious studies scholars regarding him as one of the most important figures in Thai Buddhist history.[^131] His reputation rests on multiple foundations that together create a portrait of genuine spiritual attainment combined with practical effectiveness.

Academic researchers have highlighted his educational innovations and their lasting impact. The Journal of International Buddhist Studies published an analytical study emphasizing that Somdej Toh's importance extends beyond his personal path to encompass "the collective historical result of early Rattanakosin monastic education."[^132] This assessment recognizes him not merely as an individual monk, however accomplished, but as a transformative figure who shaped the entire educational system of Thai Buddhism during a crucial formative period.[^133]

Defenders of Somdej Toh's legacy emphasize his authentic embodiment of Buddhist virtues in an era when such authenticity was rare among powerful religious figures.[^134] Despite his close connections to royalty and his elevation to the highest monastic ranks, he maintained genuine humility, lived simply, and remained accessible to common people.[^135] This combination of power and humility is particularly praised by scholars who note that religious leaders with such access to wealth and influence typically succumb to corruption or arrogance.[^136]

His scholarly contributions are recognized by both traditional and academic scholars. His preservation and adaptation of the Chinabanchorn Katha demonstrates sophisticated textual analysis and cultural translation skills, taking an ancient text and making it accessible without losing its essential spiritual power.[^137] His use of Thai poetry to convey Dharma shows an understanding that effective teaching requires cultural resonance, not just doctrinal accuracy.[^138] These skills mark him as a religious intellectual of considerable sophistication.[^139]

Supporters also emphasize the concrete benefits his work provided to Thai society. The temples and Buddha images he constructed employed local workers, beautified communities, and provided focal points for religious practice.[^140] The amulets he created gave millions of ordinary Thai people tangible connections to Buddhist spirituality and sources of comfort in difficult times.[^141] His teachings preserved traditional Buddhist knowledge while making it accessible to people who could not read Pali texts.[^142] From this perspective, Somdej Toh was not merely a saint isolated in meditation but an engaged religious leader who improved the lives of his contemporaries.[^143]

Thai Buddhist practitioners generally regard Somdej Toh with uncritical veneration, viewing him as an arahant (fully enlightened being) whose supernatural powers confirmed his spiritual attainments.[^144] Stories of his miracles continue to be shared among devotees, not as mere legends but as evidence of the continued efficacy of Buddhist practice.[^145] For these believers, Somdej Toh proves that enlightenment is achievable and that the Buddhist path can produce beings of extraordinary spiritual power and moral purity.[^146]

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of Somdej Toh are relatively rare and generally mild compared to critiques of other historical religious figures, but several scholarly perspectives offer more nuanced or skeptical views.[^147]

Rationalist scholars, particularly those influenced by Buddhist modernism, express concern that the supernatural elements of Somdej Toh's story may actually undermine appreciation for Buddhism's philosophical and psychological insights.[^148] They argue that attributing powers like levitation and mind-reading to him creates an image of Buddhism as a magical tradition rather than a path of wisdom and ethical development.[^149] These critics suggest that the miraculous stories, whether true or not, distract from Somdej Toh's genuine accomplishments in education, textual preservation, and institutional development.[^150]

Some historians question the historical reliability of many stories about Somdej Toh, noting that hagiographic accounts written by devoted disciples are not objective historical sources.[^151] Details of his early life, his parentage, specific miracles, and even some aspects of his relationship with King Rama IV may have been embellished or invented to enhance his prestige.[^152] These scholars call for more critical historical analysis that distinguishes verifiable facts from pious legends.[^153]

Social critics note that despite his influence, Somdej Toh did not challenge the fundamental social hierarchies or political structures of his time.[^154] He maintained respectful relationships with the absolute monarchy and the aristocratic elite, never advocating for the poor or oppressed in ways that would threaten existing power structures.[^155] While such criticism may be anachronistic—expecting 19th-century religious figures to embrace modern concepts of social justice—it does raise questions about the social role of religious leaders.[^156]

The commercialization of Somdej Toh's legacy through the amulet market troubles some Buddhist reformers who see it as fundamentally contrary to Buddhist principles of non-attachment and the rejection of materialism.[^157] While Somdej Toh himself cannot be blamed for developments long after his death, critics argue that creating objects of such high value was bound to lead to commercialization and fraud.[^158] They contend that a truly wise teacher would have foreseen this problem and avoided creating objects that would become commodities.[^159]

Finally, some critics within Thai Buddhist circles question whether the intense devotion to Somdej Toh borders on idolatry, potentially contradicting the Buddha's teaching that practitioners should rely on themselves and the Dharma rather than external saviors.[^160] When people pray to Somdej Toh's image for lottery numbers or business success rather than engaging in serious meditation and ethical development, critics argue that his legacy has been distorted into something he would not have approved.[^161]
