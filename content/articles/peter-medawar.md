## Summary

Peter Medawar discovered acquired immunological tolerance — that the immune system can be taught to accept foreign tissues — opening the door to organ transplantation. His experiments showed that neonatal mice could accept skin grafts from unrelated donors. He shared the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Macfarlane Burnet.
