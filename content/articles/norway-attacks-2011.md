## Overview

On July 22, 2011, neo-Nazi terrorist Anders Behring Breivik carried out two sequential attacks in Norway, killing 77 people. First, he detonated a van bomb in Oslo's government quarter, killing 8. Then, masquerading as a police officer, he traveled to the island of Utøya, where the youth wing of the Labour Party was holding a summer camp. For 69 minutes, he hunted down and shot teenagers, killing 69. It was the deadliest attack in Norway since WWII. Breivik claimed he was fighting "Islamization" and "Marxism." The tragedy tested Norway's commitment to openness and rehabilitation; he was sentenced to the maximum allowed by law (21 years, renewable indefinitely).

## Norway's Response

### "More Democracy, More Openness"

**PM Jens Stoltenberg:**
> "Our answer is more democracy, more openness, and more humanity... but never naivety."

**Flower Marches:**
200,000 Norwegians gathered in Oslo holding roses. Sang "Children of the Rainbow" (song Breivik hated).

**Prison Conditions:**
Breivik held in isolation but with three cells (living, study, gym) and video games. Norway stuck to humane rehabilitation principles, even for "monster."
