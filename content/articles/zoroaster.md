## Summary

Zarathushtra Spitama, known in the West as Zoroaster, was an ancient Iranian religious prophet and reformer who founded Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions.[^1] Living sometime between 1500 and 628 BCE, he challenged the polytheistic traditions of ancient Iran and introduced revolutionary concepts including ethical dualism, free will, individual judgment after death, and the eventual resurrection of the dead.[^2] His teachings, preserved in the Gathas of the Avesta, profoundly influenced later Abrahamic religions and shaped Persian civilization for over a millennium.[^3] Despite scholarly debates about his historicity and exact dates, Zoroaster's impact on religious thought remains undeniable, as he introduced concepts of heaven, hell, Satan, and the final judgment that would echo through Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Zoroaster was born into the Spitama clan of ancient Iran, a priestly family that belonged to the traditional religious establishment.[^5] The epithet "Spitama" itself means "abundant strength" or "white," thought to have been taken from an eponymous ancestor.[^6] His father was Pourushaspa of the Spitama family, and his mother was Dugdōw.[^7] According to tradition, he had four brothers, two older and two younger, growing up in a society where the priestly class held significant religious and social authority.[^8]

The exact circumstances of Zoroaster's birth remain shrouded in legend and uncertainty. Born into a culture dominated by the worship of multiple deities and nature spirits, the young Zarathushtra would have been educated in the traditional priestly rites and practices.[^9] As a member of the priest class and descendant of practicing priests, he would have been trained in the recitation of sacred hymns, the performance of sacrificial rituals, and the maintenance of the sacred fire.[^10] He refers to himself in the Gathas as a poet-priest and prophet, suggesting a deep engagement with the religious and literary traditions of his time.[^11]

The dating of Zoroaster's life represents one of the most contentious issues in ancient religious history. Traditional Zoroastrian sources place him around 628-551 BCE, calculating that he "lived 258 years before Alexander" the Great, which could refer to Alexander's conquest of Persia in 330 BCE.[^12] However, modern scholars using linguistic and socio-cultural evidence have proposed much earlier dates, with some placing Zoroaster between 1500 and 1000 BCE.[^13] This earlier dating is primarily based on linguistic similarities between the Old Avestan language of the Gathas and the Sanskrit of the Rigveda (c. 1700–1100 BCE).[^14] The lack of concrete historical evidence means that Zoroaster's exact dates remain uncertain, with scholars acknowledging a range anywhere from 1500 to 600 BCE as possible.[^15]

Little is known about Zoroaster's early life beyond what can be gleaned from the Gathas and later legendary accounts. The Avesta, the only authentic source of information on Zarathustra outside of commentaries and legends, does not concern itself with the biographical details of the prophet's life.[^16] This scarcity of historical documentation has led to ongoing scholarly debates about whether Zoroaster was even a real historical figure, with some suggesting that the historicization surrounding him may be part of a trend from before the 10th century CE that transformed legends and myths into supposed history.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Zoroaster's transformation from traditional priest to revolutionary prophet began around age 30, when he experienced a profound divine revelation that would change the course of religious history.[^18] While fetching water at dawn for a sacred ritual by a river bank during a spring festival, he saw a shining being who revealed himself as Vohu Manah (Good Purpose), one of the Amesha Spentas or Holy Immortals.[^19] This luminous figure led Zoroaster into the presence of Ahura Mazda, the Wise Lord, introducing him to a radically new understanding of divinity and the cosmos.[^20]

In this transformative vision, Zoroaster encountered not a pantheon of competing deities but a single supreme god, Ahura Mazda, who occupied the center of a kingdom of justice that promised immortality and bliss.[^21] He learned of the existence of two primal spirits in eternal conflict: the forces of Asha (truth, order, righteousness) and Druj (deception, chaos, wickedness).[^22] This revelation introduced the concept of cosmic dualism—not as two equal gods, but as two opposing forces with Ahura Mazda ultimately supreme.[^23] Zoroaster received further revelations and saw visions of the seven Amesha Spenta, divine beings who would become central to Zoroastrian theology.[^24]

Armed with this revolutionary message, Zoroaster began preaching at approximately age 40, but his early efforts met with fierce resistance.[^25] The established priesthood, known as the karapans, saw his monotheistic teachings as a direct threat to their authority and the traditional polytheistic system that sustained their power.[^26] His message of individual moral responsibility, free choice between good and evil, and direct relationship with Ahura Mazda challenged not only religious orthodoxy but also the social hierarchy built upon it.[^27] For years, Zoroaster struggled to gain followers, facing rejection and persecution in his homeland.[^28]

The turning point came when Zoroaster, at about age 42, gained an audience with King Vishtaspa, a ruler whose patronage would prove crucial for the survival and spread of the new faith.[^29] The conversion of Vishtaspa was far from immediate. Initially, the king was no more pleased at hearing of a new faith than the people of Zarathustra's hometown had been.[^30] Vishtaspa ordered a theological debate between Zoroaster and the court priests, but when this challenged the status quo too dramatically, he had Zoroaster imprisoned.[^31] According to tradition, Zoroaster's fortunes changed when he miraculously healed the king's favorite horse, which had been suffering from paralysis.[^32] This demonstration of divine favor inclined Vishtaspa to listen to Zarathustra's message again in private, ultimately leading to the king's conversion.[^33]

Vishtaspa's conversion marked a watershed moment for Zoroastrianism. The king decreed Zarathustra's new faith the religion of the land, providing the political and military support it needed to survive and grow.[^34] The Gathas celebrate Vishtaspa as "the patron of Zoroaster and the establisher of the first Zoroastrian community."[^35] With royal protection, Zoroaster was able to establish a faithful community of believers, train priests in the new doctrine, and see his teachings spread throughout the region.[^36] However, this success came at a price. A series of battles against neighboring tribes who rejected the new faith followed King Vishtaspa's conversion, as the religious transformation inevitably became entangled with political and military conflicts.[^37]

## Major Achievements

Zoroaster's most enduring achievement was the composition of the Gathas, seventeen hymns consisting of 238 stanzas totaling approximately 1,300 lines or 6,000 words, which form the oldest and most sacred part of the Avesta.[^38] These hymns, composed in Old Avestan—an ancient Iranian language closely related to the Sanskrit of the Rigveda—are traditionally believed to be the direct words of the prophet himself.[^39] The Gathas convey Zoroaster's core teachings about ethics, dualism, and the fundamental importance of free will in choosing between good and evil.[^40] Scholars believe they were composed before 1000 BCE and passed down orally for centuries before being committed to writing.[^41]

The theological revolution Zoroaster initiated cannot be overstated. He was the first religious thinker to teach the doctrines of individual judgment after death, heaven and hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general last judgment, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body.[^42] These concepts, which would become "familiar articles of faith to much of mankind through borrowing by Judaism, Christianity and Islam," represent Zoroaster's most significant contribution to religious thought.[^43] His teaching that Ahura Mazda was the supreme uncreated, benevolent, and all-wise deity who created the universe through thought alone challenged the prevailing polytheistic worldview of ancient Iran.[^44]

Zoroaster established a sophisticated ethical system centered on the triad of "Good Thoughts, Good Words, and Good Deeds."[^45] He emphasized the freedom of individuals to choose right or wrong and their personal responsibility for their deeds, making this choice to accept asha (truth/order) and shun druj (falsehood/chaos) a matter of individual decision rather than divine dictate.[^46] This revolutionary emphasis on free will and personal moral agency distinguished Zoroastrianism from fatalistic religious systems and placed ethical responsibility squarely on human shoulders.[^47]

The prophet's teachings extended beyond theology to encompass social and environmental ethics remarkably progressive for the Bronze Age. Zoroaster spoke in the Gathas of the rights of plants and animals, minerals and waters, advocating reverence and nurture for all creation.[^48] He established three main principles seeking co-existence in harmony between God, human beings, and nature, approximately 3,000 years before modern environmental movements.[^49] Under the influence of Zoroastrianism, Persian kings would later establish the world's first forestry administration and nature reserves, while animal sacrifices were prohibited in favor of more humane religious practices.[^50]

Zoroaster successfully converted his immediate family, including his wife, children, and a cousin named Maidhyoimangha, who became his first followers after his illumination from Ahura Mazda.[^51] He married three times according to some traditions, with his first two wives bearing him three sons—Isat Vâstra, Urvatat Nara, and Hvare Chithra—and three daughters—Freni, Thriti, and Pouruchista.[^52] This familial foundation helped establish the hereditary priesthood that would preserve and transmit Zoroastrian teachings through subsequent generations.[^53]

The religious community Zoroaster established developed a sophisticated ritual system centered on the veneration of fire as a symbol of Ahura Mazda himself.[^54] While early Zoroastrians worshipped on mounds and hills under the open sky where fires were lit, this practice evolved into the elaborate fire temple tradition.[^55] The Zoroastrian priesthood developed a three-tiered hierarchy of dastūr (bishops), mobad (ordinary priests), and herbad or ervad (assistants), with priesthood becoming hereditary though requiring formal investiture ceremonies.[^56]

Zoroaster's influence extended to shaping Persian imperial ideology. The religion became widespread by the time of the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550-330 BCE), whose ruling class were Zoroastrians.[^57] Darius I and later Achaemenid emperors acknowledged their devotion to Ahura Mazda in inscriptions, most notably in the famous Behistun inscription.[^58] The relationship between Zoroastrianism and state power became even more formalized under the Sassanid Empire (224-651 CE), when Zoroastrianism was established as the official state religion.[^59] The Sassanians aggressively adopted Zoroastrianism, spearheading a state-commissioned reconstruction of the Avesta which had been destroyed and scattered during the five centuries following Alexander's conquests.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The historical authenticity of Zoroaster himself remains one of the most controversial aspects of his legacy. By modern standards of historiography, no conclusive evidence can place him into a fixed historical period, and the historicization surrounding him may be part of a trend from before the 10th century CE that transforms legends and myths into supposed history.[^61] Some scholars have even questioned whether Zarathustra was a real historical figure at all, suggesting that the available Zoroastrian sources provide only conflicting images about him, especially between earlier and later sources.[^62]

In the early 19th century, Christian missionary John Wilson, based in British India, launched a scathing critique claiming that Zoroaster "never had a genuine divine commission, never performed miracles, or uttered prophecies" and that the story of his life is "a mere tissue of comparatively modern fables and fiction."[^63] While Wilson's critique was colored by missionary agenda, it highlighted legitimate scholarly concerns about separating historical fact from religious legend in the Zoroastrian tradition.

The authorship and authenticity of the Gathas themselves have come under scrutiny. While traditionally believed to have been composed by Zoroaster himself, scholars Jean Kellens and Éric Pirart have questioned the individuality of any single author of the Gathas, taking them as the result of religious ideas developed by a group of people, thus ruling out the existence of a founder-personality for Zoroastrianism.[^64] Kellens also criticized the Zoroastrian tradition regarding the history of the Avesta as insufficiently documented, pointing to ancient historians' statements that the Magi did not have a holy book and noting that writing was not widespread among the Achaemenids.[^65]

A fundamental theological controversy concerns whether Zoroastrianism is truly monotheistic or fundamentally dualistic. Critics have charged Zoroastrians with being followers of dualism who only claimed monotheism in modern times to conform to Christian and Western thought.[^66] The relationship between Ahura Mazda (the supreme good deity) and Angra Mainyu (the destructive spirit) presents a persistent theological problem. While orthodox Zoroastrianism teaches that Ahura Mazda is ultimately supreme and will triumph at the end of time, the practical emphasis on cosmic struggle between equal and opposite forces of good and evil has led many scholars to classify Zoroastrianism as dualistic rather than monotheistic.[^67] Opinions vary among scholars as to whether Zoroastrianism is monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, or a combination of all three.[^68]

The environmental claims made on behalf of Zoroastrianism have also faced scholarly criticism. While the tradition does enjoin Zoroastrians to respect and protect many aspects of nature, pollution is understood in ritual terms rather than ecological ones.[^69] Moreover, the dualistic Zoroastrian worldview, which posits an ongoing struggle between forces of good and evil, categorizes many animal and plant species as being on the side of evil and thus requiring destruction whenever possible—hardly an environmentally progressive stance.[^70]

Henrik Samuel Nyberg's mid-20th century interpretation of Zarathustra as merely a shaman was sharply criticized and refuted by W.B. Henning and other scholars, illustrating the ongoing disagreements about how to understand the prophet's role and significance.[^71] The problems involved in interpreting the Gathas and reconstructing a coherent picture of Zoroaster's religion continue to plague scholarship to this day.[^72]

The claimed influence of Zoroastrianism on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam has become a contentious scholarly battleground. While scholars like Mary Boyce argue that Zoroastrian concepts of heaven, hell, Satan, and judgment day directly influenced these later religions during the Jewish Babylonian exile, other scholars disagree, finding that the general social influence of Zoroastrianism was much more limited and that no direct link can be found in Jewish or Christian texts.[^73] Catholic scholars in particular have pushed back against claims of Zoroastrian influence, seeking to preserve the originality of Christian revelation.[^74]

## Personal Life

Zoroaster's personal life remains largely obscure, with most details coming from later legendary accounts rather than contemporary historical sources. As a member of the Spitama clan, he came from a priestly family with the social standing and education befitting the religious elite of ancient Iranian society.[^75] The name "Spitama" meaning "white" or "of shining power" suggested a family identity connected to concepts of purity and spiritual illumination.[^76]

According to tradition, Zoroaster married three times, though accounts differ regarding details of his marital life.[^77] Some sources identify Hvōvi as the daughter of Frashaoshtra, who was King Vishtaspa's brother and vizier, suggesting that Zoroaster's marriage connections helped solidify his relationship with royal power.[^78] Another account states that his first two wives bore him six children while Hvōvi, his third wife, was childless.[^79] His three sons were named Isat Vâstra, Urvatat Nara, and Hvare Chithra, while his three daughters were Freni, Thriti, and Pouruchista.[^80]

The conversion of Zoroaster's immediate family played a crucial role in establishing the new faith. His wife, children, and a cousin named Maidhyoimangha became his first converts after his divine illumination from Ahura Mazda at age 30.[^81] This familial foundation provided the prophet with a core community of believers who could support and propagate his revolutionary message during the difficult early years of rejection and persecution.[^82] The fact that his own family accepted his claims to divine revelation lent credibility to his prophetic mission and helped establish the hereditary priesthood that would characterize Zoroastrianism for millennia.[^83]

As a poet-priest and prophet, Zoroaster's personality emerges from the Gathas as passionate, uncompromising, and deeply committed to his divine mission.[^84] His writings reveal a man who saw the world in stark moral terms—the cosmic struggle between truth and falsehood, order and chaos, good and evil—yet who also emphasized individual free will and personal responsibility.[^85] His famous teaching, "Listen to the best things with your ears, reflect upon them with an unbiased mind. Then let each man and woman for him or her self choose between the two ways thinking," reveals a personality that valued rational contemplation alongside religious devotion.[^86]

The traditional accounts describe Zoroaster as living for 77 years, a number that may have symbolic rather than strictly biographical significance.[^87] According to legend, he managed to establish a faithful community and lived for many years after King Vishtaspa's conversion, seeing his teachings take root and spread.[^88] His role as both spiritual leader and social reformer required not just theological brilliance but also practical skills in community organization, ritual design, and political negotiation—talents that enabled him to transform a personal religious vision into an enduring institutional religion.[^89]

## Legacy

Zoroaster's legacy as one of history's most influential religious figures extends far beyond the relatively small Zoroastrian community that survives today. His fundamental theological innovations—monotheism or near-monotheism, ethical dualism, individual moral responsibility, divine judgment, resurrection, and eschatological redemption—became foundational concepts in Western religious thought.[^90] As Mary Boyce concluded, Zoroaster was "the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgement, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general last judgement, and life everlasting," doctrines that "were to become familiar articles of faith to much of mankind, through borrowing by Judaism, Christianity and Islam."[^91]

The influence of Zoroastrianism on Judaism became particularly significant during and after the Babylonian exile (586-538 BCE), when Jews lived under Persian rule and interacted extensively with Zoroastrian ideas.[^92] Before contact with Zoroastrianism, Jews believed the dead went to "Sheol," a shadowy underworld, but after the Babylonian exile, "the idea of a moralized afterlife, with heavenly rewards for the good and hellish punishment for the evil, appear in Judaism."[^93] Zoroastrian concepts seeded dualistic ideas in Jewish eschatology, such as belief in a savior, the final battle between good and evil, the triumph of good, and the resurrection of the dead—ideas that later passed to Christianity via Zoroastrian-inspired texts of the Old Testament.[^94]

The political legacy of Zoroastrianism shaped Persian imperial ideology for over a millennium. Under the Achaemenid Empire, Zoroastrian concepts of divine kingship, cosmic order, and the ruler's responsibility to uphold truth and justice became central to Persian political theology.[^95] Darius I's famous Behistun inscription repeatedly invokes Ahura Mazda as the source of his authority and the guarantor of his righteous rule.[^96] The Sassanid Empire (224-651 CE) made Zoroastrianism the state religion, creating an official orthodoxy and undertaking massive efforts to compile and standardize the Avesta.[^97]

The Arab-Islamic conquest of Persia (633-651 CE) marked the beginning of Zoroastrianism's long decline from dominant state religion to persecuted minority faith.[^98] Although the early caliphs adhered to a general policy of religious tolerance, treating Zoroastrians as dhimmī (protected peoples), progressive restrictions over subsequent centuries encouraged mass conversion to Islam.[^99] The imposition of the jizyah tax, prohibitions on building new temples, restrictions on dress and occupation, and various forms of social discrimination gradually eroded the Zoroastrian community.[^100] Many Zoroastrians emigrated, with a substantial number fleeing to India where their descendants, the Parsis, would preserve the faith and achieve remarkable economic success.[^101]

Today, Zoroastrianism survives with approximately 100,000 to 200,000 followers worldwide.[^102] The largest communities are the Parsis of India (approximately 61,000 as of 2011 census) and Iranian Zoroastrians (approximately 25,000).[^103] Despite their small numbers, Parsis have had a disproportionate impact on Indian society, contributing 5-6 percent of India's economic turnover while comprising only 0.006 percent of the population.[^104] The Zoroastrian diaspora has spread globally in recent decades, with communities in North America, Canada, Britain, Australia, and the Middle East preserving ancient traditions while adapting to modern contexts.[^105]

Zoroaster's influence extended into Western philosophy through Friedrich Nietzsche's masterwork "Thus Spoke Zarathustra" (1883-1885).[^106] Nietzsche chose Zarathustra as his protagonist to pay homage to the original Aryan prophet as the founding figure of moral interpretation of existence, while simultaneously reversing his teachings.[^107] Where the historical Zoroaster established moral dualism and the cosmic struggle between good and evil, Nietzsche's Zarathustra proclaimed the death of God and the need to move beyond good and evil.[^108] This philosophical appropriation ensured that Zoroaster's name and concepts would continue to resonate in modern Western thought, influencing existentialism, poststructuralism, and postmodernism.[^109]

The ecological legacy of Zoroastrianism represents an often-overlooked aspect of the prophet's teaching. His Bronze Age advocacy for the rights of plants, animals, minerals, and waters, and his teaching that humans must live in harmony with nature, anticipated modern environmental ethics by three millennia.[^110] Under Zoroastrian influence, Persian kings established the world's first forestry administration and nature reserves, while Zoroastrian prohibition of animal sacrifice represented a significant advance in animal welfare.[^111]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and defenders of Zoroaster's legacy emphasize his revolutionary role in religious history and his profound influence on subsequent monotheistic traditions. Mary Boyce, one of the 20th century's most eminent Zoroastrian scholars, argued forcefully that Zoroaster was "the first to teach the doctrines of an individual judgement, Heaven and Hell, the future resurrection of the body, the general last judgement, and life everlasting for the reunited soul and body."[^112] Her extensive research into Zoroastrian history and practice established Zoroaster as a genuinely original religious thinker whose innovations fundamentally shaped Western religious consciousness.

Many scholars view Zoroaster as the first true monotheist or at least the first systematic theologian to subordinate all other divine beings to a single supreme deity, Ahura Mazda.[^113] This theological innovation represented a radical departure from the polytheistic systems that dominated ancient religious thought and paved the way for later monotheistic religions. The sophistication of Zoroastrian ethics, particularly the emphasis on free will, individual moral responsibility, and the cosmic significance of human choices, has earned praise from historians of religion as a remarkable achievement in ancient moral philosophy.[^114]

Defenders of Zoroastrianism's historical importance point to the linguistic and cultural evidence demonstrating the religion's influence on Judaism during the Babylonian exile and subsequent Persian period.[^115] The appearance of angelology, demonology, eschatological concepts, and dualistic frameworks in post-exilic Judaism strongly suggests Zoroastrian influence, even if direct textual borrowing cannot be definitively proven.[^116] Scholars argue that the transformation of Jewish and, by extension, Christian and Islamic theology owes a substantial debt to Zoroastrian innovations, making Zoroaster's legacy central to understanding Western religious development.[^117]

The environmental ethics embedded in Zoroastrian teaching have gained increased scholarly appreciation in recent decades. Zoroaster's advocacy for the protection of the seven creations—sky, water, earth, plants, animals, humans, and fire—and his teaching that humans have a special duty to serve and protect these creations, represents a sophisticated environmental ethic millennia ahead of its time.[^118] The establishment of forestry administration and nature reserves under Zoroastrian-influenced Persian kings provides concrete evidence of how these teachings shaped policy and practice.[^119]

Admirers emphasize Zoroaster's social and cultural achievements alongside his theological innovations. His elevation of agriculture and settled civilization over nomadic pastoralism helped shape Persian society's development, while his prohibition of animal sacrifice and emphasis on humane treatment of animals represented significant ethical advances.[^120] The egalitarian aspects of his teaching—particularly the emphasis that both men and women must choose between good and evil for themselves—have been praised as progressive for ancient society.[^121]

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptical scholars raise fundamental questions about Zoroaster's historical existence and the authenticity of traditions surrounding him. By modern historiographic standards, no conclusive evidence places Zoroaster in a fixed historical period, leading some to suggest that he may be a legendary or mythological figure rather than a historical person.[^122] The conflicting images of Zoroaster in early versus later sources, and the fact that the Avesta itself provides minimal biographical information, fuel skepticism about separating historical fact from religious legend.[^123]

Jean Kellens and other critical scholars have questioned the individual authorship of the Gathas, suggesting they represent the collective religious ideas of a group rather than the compositions of a single prophetic founder.[^124] This scholarly position, if correct, would undermine traditional claims about Zoroaster's originality and genius, recasting Zoroastrianism as a gradual religious development rather than the revelation of a single prophetic figure. Kellens's criticism of the Zoroastrian tradition as "insufficiently documented" and his pointing to the scarcity of written documents among the Achaemenids raises serious questions about the reliability of later accounts.[^125]

The theological coherence of Zoroastrianism has been challenged by critics who see an unresolved tension between monotheism and dualism. The problem of evil posed by Angra Mainyu's existence and power has led many scholars to classify Zoroastrianism as fundamentally dualistic rather than genuinely monotheistic.[^126] Critics argue that Zoroastrians' modern claims to monotheism represent an accommodation to dominant Christian and Islamic frameworks rather than an authentic interpretation of the ancient tradition.[^127] The great problem of the origin of evil, which Zoroastrianism attempted to solve through "the trenchant device of two separate creators and creations: one good, the other evil," creates theological difficulties that have never been fully resolved.[^128]

19th-century Christian missionary John Wilson's harsh assessment—that Zoroaster "never had a genuine divine commission, never performed miracles, or uttered prophecies" and that his life story is "a mere tissue of comparatively modern fables and fiction"—represents an extreme but influential critical perspective.[^129] While Wilson's missionary agenda colored his critique, his fundamental point about the unreliability of later Zoroastrian hagiography resonates with modern critical scholarship's skepticism about miraculous accounts and legendary embellishments.

The claimed influence of Zoroastrianism on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam has been disputed by scholars who find the evidence for direct borrowing weak or circumstantial.[^130] Critics point out that similar religious concepts can develop independently in different cultures and that the appearance of analogous ideas in different religions does not prove direct influence or borrowing.[^131] Catholic and conservative Jewish scholars in particular have resisted claims of Zoroastrian influence, seeking to preserve the originality and divine inspiration of biblical revelation.[^132]

The environmental claims made on behalf of Zoroastrianism have faced scholarly pushback. Critics note that Zoroastrian concern for purity is ritual rather than ecological, and that the dualistic framework actually mandates the destruction of animals and plants categorized as "evil" creations of Angra Mainyu.[^133] This hardly represents a consistently pro-environmental ethic, and claims of Zoroastrianism as an ecological religion have been challenged as modern reinterpretations that project contemporary values onto ancient texts.[^134]
