## Summary

Li Siguang was a pioneering Chinese geologist who developed the theory of geomechanics and used it to predict the location of oil deposits in China. When foreign experts claimed China was oil-poor, his geological theories led to the discovery of the Daqing oil field and other major petroleum reserves, transforming China's energy landscape.
