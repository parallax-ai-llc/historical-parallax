## Summary

Ross Perot founded Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in 1962, which became one of the largest technology services companies in the world. He later founded Perot Systems. He ran for president as an independent candidate in 1992 and 1996, winning 18.9% of the popular vote in 1992—the strongest showing by a third-party candidate in 80 years. His straight-talking style and focus on the national debt made him a unique figure in American politics.
