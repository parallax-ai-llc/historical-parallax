## Summary

Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard is a German biologist who shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her discoveries concerning the genetic control of early embryonic development. Her systematic screens of Drosophila mutations identified genes controlling body plan formation. Her work revealed that similar genes control development across many species, including humans.
