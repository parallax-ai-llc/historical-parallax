## Summary

Tabitha Babbitt is credited with inventing the circular saw in 1813. As a Shaker community member, she observed the inefficiency of the two-man pit saw and attached a circular blade to her spinning wheel. Her innovation dramatically improved lumber production, though as a Shaker she did not patent her inventions.
