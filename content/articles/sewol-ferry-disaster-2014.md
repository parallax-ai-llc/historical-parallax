## Overview

The sinking of the MV *Sewol* on April 16, 2014, is widely considered the most traumatic event in modern South Korean history. The ferry, carrying 476 people (mostly students from Danwon High School on a field trip to Jeju Island), capsized and sank. 304 people died. The tragedy was not the accident itself, but the **failure of command**: the captain and crew abandoned the ship while ordering students to "stay put," and the Coast Guard failed to enter the vessel to rescue trapped passengers. It exposed systemic corruption, regulatory failure, and incompetence at the highest levels of government.

## Causes: A Floating Time Bomb

**1. Illegal Redesign:**
The ship was bought used from Japan and illegally modified to add more passenger cabins (top-heavy).
**2. Overloading:**
To sustain profit, it carried 2,142 tons of cargo (3x the limit) and dumped ballast water to hide the weight line.
**3. The Turn:**
The inexperienced Third Mate made a sharp turn. The cargo (improperly secured) shifted. The ship tilted and never recovered.

## The Golden Time (Timeline of Failure)

**08:49:** The ship lists.
**08:52:** First distress call (by a student, Choi Duk-ha, who later died).
**Orders:** The intercom repeatedly announced: *"Do not move. Stay where you are. It is dangerous if you move."* Students obeyed, waiting in their cabins as the water rose.
**09:30:** The Captain (Lee Joon-seok) and crew were the first to be rescued by the Coast Guard. They did not inform rescuers that hundreds were trapped inside.
**10:17:** The ship fully capsized.
**The "Blue House" Response:**
President Park Geun-hye was unreachable for 7 crucial hours. When she appeared at 5 PM, she asked, "The students are wearing life vests, so why is it so hard to find them?" (Showing she had no understanding that they were trapped *inside* the hull).

## The Yellow Ribbon

The disaster sparked a nationwide movement.
**The Divers:** Civilian divers risked their lives (and some died) to retrieve bodies from the dark, silt-filled interior.
**Political Impact:**
The "7 Hours" became a central issue in the candlelight protests that led to President Park's impeachment in 2017.
**Safety Culture:**
Before Sewol: "Speed and Efficiency."
After Sewol: "Safety First." (Though critics argue systemic changes are slow).
