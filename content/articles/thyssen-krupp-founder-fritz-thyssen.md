## Summary

Fritz Thyssen was a German industrialist and early financial supporter of the Nazi Party who later turned against the regime. He inherited the Thyssen steel empire and initially bankrolled Hitler's rise to power. He broke with the Nazis in 1939 over the invasion of Poland and fled Germany. He was imprisoned during the war and his industrial holdings were seized. His story exemplifies the complex relationship between German industry and Nazism.
