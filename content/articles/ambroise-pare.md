## Summary

Ambroise Paré is considered the father of modern surgery. He revolutionized wound treatment by replacing boiling oil cauterization with a soothing balm of egg yolk, rose oil, and turpentine. He pioneered the use of ligatures to seal blood vessels during amputation and designed innovative prosthetic limbs. He served as surgeon to four French kings.
