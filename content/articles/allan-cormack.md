## Summary

Allan Cormack developed the mathematical theory behind computed tomography (CT) scanning in the 1960s, independently of Godfrey Hounsfield. His theoretical work showed how X-ray measurements from different angles could be combined to create cross-sectional images. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this contribution to medical imaging.
