## Summary

Robert Jarvik designed the Jarvik-7 total artificial heart, which was implanted in Barney Clark in 1982 — the first permanent artificial heart in a human. Clark survived 112 days with the device. Though not a long-term solution, the Jarvik-7 demonstrated the feasibility of mechanical heart replacement and led to modern ventricular assist devices.
