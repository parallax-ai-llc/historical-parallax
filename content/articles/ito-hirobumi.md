## Summary

Itō Hirobumi (1841-1909) was a transformative Japanese statesman who served as Japan's first Prime Minister and principal architect of the Meiji Constitution. Rising from humble samurai origins, he became one of the most influential figures in Japan's rapid modernization during the Meiji era, serving four separate terms as Prime Minister between 1885 and 1901. His legacy is deeply complex: celebrated in Japan as a founding father of the modern state, yet reviled in Korea as the architect of colonial oppression. He was assassinated in 1909 by Korean independence activist An Jung-geun in Harbin, Manchuria, an act that crystallized his polarized historical reputation.

## Early Life and Background

Itō Hirobumi was born on October 16, 1841, in the Chōshū domain (present-day Yamaguchi Prefecture) as Hayashi Risuke, the son of a poor farmer.[^1] His family's circumstances were modest, and his father, Hayashi Juzo, worked as an adopted son-in-law to the Hayashi family before later being adopted into the lower-ranking Itō family, allowing young Risuke to take the Itō surname and gain samurai status, albeit of the lowest rank.[^2]

Growing up during the tumultuous final decades of the Tokugawa shogunate, Itō witnessed firsthand the social and political tensions that would eventually lead to the Meiji Restoration. Despite his humble origins, he received a good education, studying under Yoshida Shōin, one of the most influential intellectual figures of the late Edo period.[^3] Yoshida's academy, the Shōka Sonjuku, emphasized loyalty to the emperor and resistance to Western encroachment, ideas that would profoundly shape Itō's early political consciousness, though he would later adopt a more pragmatic approach to Western engagement.

In his youth, Itō was an ardent supporter of the sonnō jōi ("revere the emperor, expel the barbarians") movement, which opposed the shogunate's opening of Japan to foreign powers.[^4] In 1862, at age 21, he participated in the burning of the British legation in Edo, an act of anti-foreign violence that reflected the radical nationalism of many young samurai of his generation.[^5] However, this incident would mark a turning point in his thinking. Shortly afterward, Itō was selected as one of the Chōshū Five, a group of young men sent secretly to study in Britain in 1863, defying the shogunate's prohibition on foreign travel.[^6]

His time in London proved transformative. Exposed to British parliamentary democracy, industrial technology, and imperial power, Itō underwent a profound ideological shift. He came to recognize that Japan's survival in the modern world required not the expulsion of foreigners but the adoption and adaptation of Western knowledge and institutions.[^7] When he learned that Chōshū forces were preparing to attack Western ships, he rushed back to Japan to counsel against such reckless action, demonstrating his newfound pragmatism.[^8]

## Rise to Power

Itō's rise to prominence began in earnest during the Meiji Restoration of 1868, when the Tokugawa shogunate collapsed and imperial rule was restored under Emperor Meiji. As a member of the Chōshū domain, which played a crucial role in overthrowing the shogunate alongside Satsuma, Itō was well-positioned to enter the new government.[^9] His Western education and language skills made him particularly valuable to the reformist leadership.

In the early Meiji government, Itō held a series of increasingly important positions. He served in the Bureau of Foreign Affairs and quickly distinguished himself as an effective administrator and diplomat.[^10] In 1870, he traveled to the United States as part of a mission to study Western monetary systems, further expanding his knowledge of foreign institutions.[^11] His most significant early achievement came in 1871 when he participated in the Iwakura Mission, a nearly two-year diplomatic and study tour of the United States and Europe led by Iwakura Tomomi.[^12]

The Iwakura Mission profoundly influenced Itō's thinking about constitutional government. In Europe, particularly in Germany, he studied under leading constitutional scholars and observed Bismarck's model of constitutional monarchy, which balanced monarchical authority with parliamentary institutions.[^13] This experience convinced him that Japan needed a written constitution to gain recognition as a civilized nation and to provide a stable framework for modernization, while preserving imperial sovereignty.[^14]

Upon returning to Japan, Itō became increasingly central to the Meiji government's inner circle. He played a key role in suppressing the Saga Rebellion of 1874 and helped manage the transition from domains to prefectures, a fundamental administrative reform.[^15] By the late 1870s and early 1880s, he had emerged as one of the most powerful oligarchs (genrō) who effectively controlled Japanese politics behind the scenes.[^16]

In 1881, Itō helped precipitate a political crisis that resulted in the expulsion of Ōkuma Shigenobu, a rival politician who advocated for British-style parliamentary government, from the government.[^17] This incident, known as the Political Crisis of 1881, allowed Itō to consolidate control over the constitutional drafting process. Emperor Meiji subsequently tasked him with traveling to Europe to study constitutional systems in preparation for drafting Japan's own constitution.[^18]

Between 1882 and 1883, Itō spent time in Vienna and Berlin, where he studied under prominent German constitutional scholars including Rudolf von Gneist and Lorenz von Stein.[^19] He became convinced that the Prussian model, which emphasized strong executive power and limited parliamentary authority, was most suitable for Japan's circumstances.[^20] This preference for the German model over the British parliamentary system would fundamentally shape the constitution he would draft and Japan's political development for decades to come.

In 1885, the office of Prime Minister was established, replacing the earlier system of collective leadership, and Itō became Japan's first Prime Minister, a position that formalized his preeminence in Japanese politics.[^21] This marked the beginning of his dominance over Japanese government for the next two decades.

## Major Achievements

Itō Hirobumi's most enduring achievement was his principal role in drafting the Meiji Constitution, promulgated on February 11, 1889.[^22] This document, formally titled the Constitution of the Empire of Japan, established Japan as a constitutional monarchy and created the framework for a modern parliamentary system. Itō spent years carefully crafting the constitution, balancing the demands of traditionalists who wanted to preserve imperial prerogatives with the need to create institutions that would satisfy Western powers and domestic reformers.[^23]

The Meiji Constitution established a bicameral Imperial Diet consisting of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, though the constitution carefully limited parliamentary power.[^24] Sovereignty resided with the emperor, who possessed supreme command of the military and could issue ordinances that had the force of law.[^25] Ministers were responsible to the emperor, not the Diet, a provision that would have profound consequences for Japan's political development.[^26] While modern critics have highlighted the constitution's authoritarian features, it represented a remarkable achievement for its time, making Japan the first Asian nation to adopt a written constitution and parliamentary institutions.[^27]

As Prime Minister across four separate terms (1885-1888, 1892-1896, 1898, and 1900-1901), Itō oversaw crucial aspects of Japan's modernization.[^28] He promoted industrialization, reformed the tax system, and helped establish modern legal codes based on European models.[^29] His government created the foundations for Japan's economic transformation, supporting the development of strategic industries and infrastructure, including railways and telegraph systems.[^30]

Itō played a central role in revising the unequal treaties that Japan had been forced to sign with Western powers in the 1850s and 1860s.[^31] Through patient diplomacy and the demonstration of Japan's modernization, he helped negotiate treaty revisions that gradually restored Japan's tariff autonomy and ended extraterritoriality for foreigners.[^32] The Anglo-Japanese Alliance of 1902, negotiated while Itō served as genrō, represented the culmination of this diplomatic effort, making Japan the first Asian power to enter a military alliance with a Western nation on equal terms.[^33]

In the realm of foreign policy, Itō was deeply involved in Japan's imperial expansion. He supported the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), which resulted in Japan's acquisition of Taiwan and establishment as a regional power.[^34] He participated in the peace negotiations at Shimonoseki, where he represented Japan alongside Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu.[^35] The Treaty of Shimonoseki, which concluded the war, forced China to recognize Korea's independence (from Chinese suzerainty), cede Taiwan and the Liaodong Peninsula to Japan, and pay a substantial indemnity.[^36]

Following Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), Itō was appointed as the first Resident-General of Korea in 1905, a position he held until 1909.[^37] In this role, he oversaw the gradual transformation of Korea from a protectorate to a colony, a process that would culminate in formal annexation in 1910, shortly after his death.[^38] He implemented administrative reforms, promoted Japanese economic interests, and systematically undermined Korean sovereignty.[^39]

Itō was also instrumental in establishing Japan's modern peerage system, which he created to staff the House of Peers with reliable supporters of the government.[^40] He helped found the Rikken Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government Party) in 1900, Japan's first genuine political party led by a genrō, representing an attempt to create a more stable relationship between the oligarchs and the Diet.[^41]

Beyond politics, Itō contributed to educational and cultural modernization. He supported the establishment of modern universities and promoted the study of Western knowledge while also emphasizing traditional Confucian values and loyalty to the emperor.[^42] His vision was to create a Japan that selectively adopted Western technology and institutions while preserving what he saw as the essence of Japanese cultural identity and the imperial institution.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Itō Hirobumi's legacy is deeply controversial, particularly regarding his role in Korea. As Resident-General from 1905 to 1909, he presided over the systematic dismantling of Korean sovereignty following the protectorate treaty that Japan had forced Korea to sign.[^44] He disbanded the Korean army, took control of Korea's foreign relations and internal administration, and suppressed Korean resistance movements with considerable brutality.[^45] The 1907 Hague Secret Emissary Affair, in which Korean Emperor Gojong sent representatives to the Hague Peace Conference to appeal for international support, led Itō to force Gojong's abdication, demonstrating his willingness to eliminate any obstacle to Japanese control.[^46]

Korean historians and many modern scholars view Itō as the principal architect of Japanese colonialism in Korea, making him one of the most hated figures in Korean history.[^47] His policies laid the groundwork for the formal annexation of Korea in 1910 and the decades of colonial rule that followed, characterized by cultural suppression, economic exploitation, and forced assimilation.[^48] Efforts to modernize Korean infrastructure and administration, which Itō and his defenders cited as beneficial, are viewed by critics as serving primarily Japanese colonial interests rather than Korean welfare.[^49]

The Meiji Constitution, despite its historical significance, has been criticized for establishing an authoritarian system that concentrated power in the hands of unelected oligarchs and the military.[^50] The provision that ministers were responsible to the emperor rather than the Diet meant that political parties had limited real power, and the military's independence from civilian control would have disastrous consequences in the 1930s and 1940s.[^51] Critics argue that Itō deliberately chose the Prussian model precisely to prevent genuine democracy and preserve oligarchic control.[^52]

Itō's political methods often involved manipulation and behind-the-scenes maneuvering that contradicted democratic principles. The Political Crisis of 1881, in which he helped engineer the expulsion of Ōkuma Shigenobu, demonstrated his willingness to use underhanded tactics to eliminate political rivals.[^53] Throughout his career, he worked to marginalize the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, which advocated for broader democratic reforms than he was willing to accept.[^54]

His personal life also attracted criticism and scandal. Itō was notorious for his womanizing and frequent visits to geisha houses, behavior that shocked even many of his contemporaries and seemed at odds with the Confucian values he publicly espoused.[^55] These personal indiscretions sometimes created political embarrassments and were exploited by his enemies.[^56]

Some historians have criticized Itō's opportunism and willingness to shift positions based on political expediency. The young radical who attacked the British legation in 1862 became the elder statesman who promoted cooperation with Britain; the advocate of limited constitutional government sometimes ruled in highly autocratic ways when it suited his purposes.[^57] While admirers see this as pragmatism, critics view it as a lack of genuine principle beyond the pursuit of power.[^58]

In economic policy, Itō's governments have been criticized for favoring large zaibatsu (industrial conglomerates) and neglecting the welfare of ordinary Japanese, particularly farmers and workers who bore much of the burden of rapid industrialization.[^59] The taxation policies he supported fell heavily on agricultural communities, contributing to rural poverty and periodic peasant uprisings.[^60]

## Personal Life

Itō Hirobumi married Umeko, the daughter of a Chōshū samurai, in 1858 when both were teenagers, an arranged marriage typical of their social class and era.[^61] The marriage produced three children: a daughter, Ikuko, and two sons, Hirokuni and Bunkichi.[^62] Despite maintaining the formal family structure, Itō's relationship with his wife was reportedly distant, and he spent relatively little time with his family, absorbed as he was in political affairs.[^63]

Itō was famous—or infamous—for his extensive relationships with geisha and his frequent patronage of pleasure quarters, behavior that was widely known and discussed even during his lifetime.[^64] He maintained long-term relationships with several geisha, and his romantic entanglements sometimes created political complications.[^65] Unlike many of his contemporaries in the Meiji oligarchy who presented austere public personas, Itō made little effort to hide his sybaritic tendencies, which both humanized him to some observers and scandalized others.[^66]

Those who knew him personally often described Itō as charming, witty, and possessed of considerable personal magnetism.[^67] He was known for his love of poetry and music, maintaining cultural interests that balanced his political activities.[^68] Despite his high position, he could be informal and accessible, qualities that helped him build political alliances across different factions.[^69]

Itō was a man of contradictions: a modernizer who valued tradition, a constitutionalist who often ruled autocratically, a public servant known for private indulgence, and a nationalist who deeply admired Western civilization.[^70] These contradictions reflected broader tensions in Meiji Japan itself, caught between rapid modernization and preservation of identity.[^71]

In his later years, Itō's health began to decline, though he remained politically active. His assassination at age 68 came while he was still deeply engaged in managing Japanese-Korean relations, suggesting he had no intention of retiring from public life.[^72] His wife Umeko survived him and received a substantial pension from the Japanese government in recognition of her husband's service.[^73]

## Legacy

Itō Hirobumi's legacy in Japan remains overwhelmingly positive, where he is remembered as one of the founding fathers of modern Japan and a key architect of the Meiji transformation.[^74] The Meiji Constitution that he drafted remained in force until 1947, providing the legal framework for Japan's emergence as a major world power.[^75] His face appeared on the 1,000 yen note from 1963 to 1984, a honor reserved for the most revered historical figures.[^76]

Numerous monuments, museums, and institutions commemorate Itō throughout Japan. His birthplace in Yamaguchi Prefecture houses a museum dedicated to his life and achievements.[^77] The Itō Hirobumi Memorial Museum in Harbin, at the site of his assassination, was established by Japanese residents before World War II and later repurposed by Chinese authorities, reflecting the complex international dimensions of his legacy.[^78]

In Korean historical memory, Itō occupies a completely different position as one of the most reviled figures in the nation's history, symbolizing Japanese imperialism at its most aggressive.[^79] An Jung-geun, the Korean independence activist who assassinated Itō, is celebrated as a national hero in both North and South Korea, with monuments and museums honoring him.[^80] The contrasting commemorations of Itō in Japan and An Jung-geun in Korea exemplify how historical figures can occupy radically different positions in different national narratives.[^81]

Itō's constitutional legacy proved double-edged. While the Meiji Constitution established parliamentary institutions and the rule of law, its structural weaknesses—particularly the military's independence from civilian control—contributed to Japan's descent into militarism in the 1930s.[^82] After World War II, American occupation authorities and Japanese reformers rejected the Meiji Constitution in favor of the current constitution, which established genuine parliamentary democracy and popular sovereignty.[^83] This suggests that even in Japan, there is recognition that Itō's constitutional vision had serious limitations.[^84]

In the field of political science and comparative constitutional studies, Itō's work remains significant as an early example of constitutional adaptation and transplantation.[^85] His effort to adapt the Prussian constitutional model to Japanese circumstances represented a sophisticated attempt at institutional engineering, even if the results were problematic.[^86] Scholars studying constitutional development in non-Western contexts continue to examine the Meiji Constitution as a case study in selective modernization.[^87]

Itō's approach to modernization—adopting Western technology and institutions while preserving cultural identity and traditional authority structures—has influenced development strategies in other Asian nations.[^88] His famous dictum about "Western science, Eastern morality" captured an approach that many modernizing elites in Asia found appealing, even as critics noted the tensions and contradictions inherent in such formulations.[^89]

The question of whether Itō would have proceeded with full annexation of Korea had he lived remains debated among historians. Some argue that he favored a protectorate system over outright annexation and that his death removed a moderating influence, while others contend that annexation was the logical culmination of policies he himself had implemented.[^90] This debate reflects broader questions about individual agency versus structural forces in historical development.[^91]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Itō Hirobumi emphasize his extraordinary achievements in guiding Japan through one of the most rapid and successful modernizations in world history.[^92] Within a single generation, Japan transformed from a feudal society on the periphery of international affairs to a constitutional state capable of defeating a major European power (Russia) in war—a transformation in which Itō played a central role.[^93]

Supporters argue that the Meiji Constitution, despite its limitations from a democratic perspective, was a remarkable achievement that successfully balanced competing demands and provided stability during a crucial period.[^94] Constitutional scholar Kaneko Kentarō, who worked closely with Itō on the constitution, defended it as carefully adapted to Japanese conditions and traditions, rather than being a slavish copy of Western models.[^95] The constitution's longevity—remaining in force for nearly six decades—suggests it successfully served important functions, even if it failed to prevent militarism.[^96]

Itō's biographer and admirer Kaneko Kentarō portrayed him as a brilliant statesman who understood the necessity of adopting Western institutions while preserving Japanese identity and sovereignty.[^97] From this perspective, Itō's pragmatic approach—his willingness to learn from the West, his understanding of power politics, and his skill at political maneuvering—were exactly what Japan needed in a dangerous international environment.[^98]

Some scholars credit Itō with preventing more extreme outcomes. His support for constitutional government, however limited, established principles that would later be expanded, and his political skills helped manage conflicts that might otherwise have led to civil war.[^99] His famous debate with Ōkuma Shigenobu, in which he defended gradualism against Ōkuma's more radical democratic proposals, is seen by some as realistic recognition of Japan's political development stage rather than mere conservatism.[^100]

Regarding Korea, some Japanese scholars have argued that Itō's protectorate policies, while coercive, included genuine efforts at modernization and development, and that he favored a more moderate approach than the military faction that would later dominate Korean policy.[^101] This "developmental colonialism" argument suggests that Korean modernization accelerated under Japanese guidance, even if the methods were problematic.[^102]

Japanese conservatives continue to celebrate Itō as a patriotic statesman who devoted his life to national service and helped Japan avoid the fate of colonization that befell other Asian nations.[^103] His successful revision of unequal treaties demonstrated that non-Western nations could gain recognition and equal standing through modernization and diplomatic skill.[^104]

### Negative Views

Critics of Itō Hirobumi emphasize his role as an architect of authoritarianism and imperialism whose legacy includes both domestic oppression and colonial exploitation.[^105] The Meiji Constitution, rather than being a necessary compromise, is viewed as a deliberate effort to establish oligarchic control while creating a facade of constitutionalism to satisfy Western observers.[^106]

Korean historians uniformly condemn Itō as a colonial oppressor whose policies devastated Korean sovereignty and laid the groundwork for decades of brutal occupation.[^107] Historian Shin Yong-ha argues that Itō's protectorate administration was characterized by systematic suppression of Korean political rights, forced economic integration serving Japanese interests, and cultural destruction.[^108] The "modernization" that occurred under his watch is viewed as serving colonial exploitation rather than Korean development.[^109]

Even Japanese progressive historians have criticized Itō for suppressing democratic movements and establishing a system that concentrated power in unelected hands.[^110] Political scientist Maruyama Masao argued that the structural weaknesses of the Meiji constitutional system, for which Itō bore primary responsibility, contributed to the rise of militarism and fascism in the 1930s.[^111] The provision making the military responsible only to the emperor, not civilian ministers, created a constitutional framework for military insubordination.[^112]

Western scholars have noted that Itō's constitutionalism was fundamentally illiberal, prioritizing state power and imperial sovereignty over individual rights and popular sovereignty.[^113] The Meiji Constitution's provisions on civil liberties were heavily qualified, allowing the government to restrict rights whenever it deemed necessary, a flexibility that was extensively abused.[^114]

Feminist scholars have criticized both Itō's personal behavior toward women and the patriarchal structures embedded in his constitutional and legal reforms.[^115] The Meiji legal codes subordinated women in family law, denied them political rights, and reinforced traditional gender hierarchies, reflecting Itō's conservative vision of social order.[^116]

Some historians question the narrative of Itō as a brilliant statesman, portraying him instead as an opportunistic power-seeker who shifted positions based on personal advantage rather than principle.[^117] His transformation from anti-foreign radical to Western-style reformer, while often cited as evidence of pragmatism, can also be seen as reflecting a fundamental lack of conviction beyond the pursuit of power.[^118]

International law scholars have examined Itō's Korean policies as a case study in illegal imperialism, noting that the protectorate treaty of 1905 was obtained through coercion and violated Korean sovereignty in ways that even contemporary international law condemned.[^119] The assassination of Queen Min in 1895, in which Japanese agents were involved, and Itō's subsequent policies demonstrated a pattern of lawless aggression that his diplomatic sophistication merely disguised.[^120]
