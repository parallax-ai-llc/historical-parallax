## Summary

Zheng Keshuang, Prince of Yanping (鄭克塽; 13 August 1670 – 22 September 1707), was the third and last ruler of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan during the 17th century.[^1] As the grandson of the legendary Ming loyalist Koxinga (Zheng Chenggong) and son of Zheng Jing, he inherited a precarious throne at age twelve following a violent coup that eliminated his elder brother Zheng Kezang.[^2] His brief two-year reign ended with the Kingdom's surrender to the Qing dynasty in 1683 after the decisive Battle of Penghu, marking the end of the last organized Ming loyalist resistance.[^3] Following his capitulation, the Kangxi Emperor granted him the title Duke of Hanjun and incorporated him into the Eight Banners system, where he lived the remainder of his life in Beijing until his death at age 37.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Zheng Keshuang was born on 13 August 1670 in Chengtian Prefecture of the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan, with the administrative center located at Fort Provintia (today's Tainan City).[^5] His father, Zheng Jing, was the second ruler of the Kingdom of Tungning and eldest son of the kingdom's founder, Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga), who had expelled the Dutch from Taiwan in 1662 and established it as a bastion of Ming loyalist resistance against the Manchu Qing dynasty.[^6] His biological mother was Lady Huang (黃氏), who held the lower status of concubine rather than principal wife to Zheng Jing.[^7] This distinction would prove crucial to his later succession, as his mother's inferior rank made his claim to rulership vulnerable to political manipulation.

The Kingdom of Tungning into which Zheng Keshuang was born represented the last remnant of the Southern Ming loyalist movement that had resisted Qing conquest since 1644.[^8] Fort Provintia, renamed "Chengtian Prefecture" (承天府, meaning "receiving the heavens") by Koxinga after defeating the Dutch, served as the administrative heart of this Ming loyalist state.[^9] The kingdom maintained Ming-era governmental structures, including a Council of Six Offices modeled after the Ming Six Ministries, and continued to use Ming titles and administrative divisions as a symbol of legitimacy and resistance to Qing rule.[^10]

Growing up as a prince in this embattled kingdom, Zheng Keshuang would have been educated in the Confucian classics and military arts appropriate to his station. A painting depicting Keshuang clad in light blue, playing chess with Chen Yonghua, represents the first known piece of Chinese visual art in Taiwan and suggests the cultivated court culture of the kingdom despite its military origins.[^11] However, his childhood was marked by the instability of a regime under constant external threat from Qing forces and internal pressures from powerful court factions.

The four generations of the Zheng family—Zheng Zhilong, Zheng Chenggong, Zheng Jing, and Zheng Keshuang—controlled maritime trade in East Asia during the seventeenth century and opened up the island of Taiwan for Chinese settlement, establishing a commercial empire that challenged both European colonial powers and the Qing dynasty.[^12] Young Keshuang was heir to this formidable legacy, but also to its increasingly untenable position as the Qing consolidated control over mainland China and turned its attention to eliminating the last Ming resistance.

## Rise to Power

The circumstances of Zheng Keshuang's accession to power were marked by violence, political intrigue, and familial tragedy. On 17 March 1681, his father Zheng Jing died after retreating to Tainan following a failed military campaign against the Qing dynasty.[^13] Zheng Jing had named his eldest son, Zheng Kezang, as his successor.[^14] However, Zheng Kezang's succession was quickly challenged by powerful court factions who saw opportunity in the young prince's vulnerability.

In a dramatic palace coup, Feng Xifan—head of the Imperial Bodyguard and one of Zheng Jing's most trusted officials—allied with military commander Liu Guoxuan, Zheng Cong, and other court officials to orchestrate Zheng Kezang's removal.[^15] The conspirators approached Queen Dowager Dong (1623-1681), Zheng Jing's mother and the widow of Koxinga, with slanderous accusations claiming that Zheng Kezang was not Zheng Jing's biological son.[^16] Whether Queen Dowager Dong, who died on 30 July 1681, actively supported the coup or was manipulated by these powerful officials remains a matter of historical debate.[^17]

The coup culminated in violence: Zheng Kezang was killed, and his supporters were eliminated from positions of power.[^18] Following this purge, the twelve-year-old Zheng Keshuang was installed on the throne as ruler of Tungning under the title "Prince of Yanping" (延平王)—the same title his grandfather Koxinga had borne.[^19] His youth and the violent circumstances of his accession meant that real power resided not with Zheng Keshuang himself, but with the officials who had orchestrated his rise, particularly Feng Xifan, who further consolidated his influence by arranging for Zheng Keshuang to marry his daughter, making himself the young ruler's father-in-law.[^20]

This succession crisis proved catastrophic for the Kingdom of Tungning's stability and defensive capabilities. The brutal power struggle alienated military commanders, demoralized loyalists, and exposed deep fractures within the court at precisely the moment when the Qing dynasty under the vigorous Kangxi Emperor was preparing its final assault on the island. The regime that Zheng Keshuang inherited in 1681 was, as historical sources describe it, "moribund"—fatally weakened by internal divisions and facing an existential external threat.[^21]

## Major Achievements

Zheng Keshuang's reign was brief, lasting only from 1681 to 1683, and occurred during a period of severe crisis for the Kingdom of Tungning. Consequently, his "achievements" must be understood within this context of defensive survival rather than expansion or reform. His most significant decision—the surrender to the Qing dynasty—is viewed by some as a pragmatic act that spared Taiwan from devastating warfare, while others condemn it as the betrayal of his grandfather's legacy.

During his truncated reign, Zheng Keshuang maintained the basic governmental structures of the Kingdom of Tungning, continuing the Ming loyalist administrative system centered at Chengtian Prefecture (modern Tainan).[^22] The kingdom continued to function as a de facto independent state with its own tax collection systems, military organization based on garrison structures, and land distribution mechanisms that had been established by his grandfather and father.[^23]

One notable aspect of the Tungning military that would gain recognition beyond Zheng Keshuang's reign was the elite rattan shield troops (Tengpaiying 藤牌营). These naval infantry, trained in the use of rattan shields and swords, had been made famous by Koxinga when they defeated Dutch forces in Taiwan.[^24] After the surrender of Koxinga's former followers on Taiwan, Zheng Keshuang and his troops, including these specialized forces, were incorporated into the Qing Eight Banners system.[^25] The Kangxi Emperor, impressed by a demonstration of their techniques, ordered 500 of these soldiers to defend Albazin against Russian Cossacks.[^26] In a remarkable display of their prowess, these rattan shield troops defeated Russian forces traveling by rafts on the river while fighting naked except for their shields, without suffering a single casualty—a testament to the military excellence that had been cultivated under Zheng family rule.[^27]

Following the devastating defeat at the Battle of Penghu in July 1683, where Qing forces under Admiral Shi Lang crushed the Tungning navy, Zheng Keshuang's court split into two factions.[^28] The "war faction," led by Zheng Dexiao, Huang Liangji, Xiao Wu, and Hong Gongzhu, advocated continued resistance.[^29] The "surrender faction," led by Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan, argued for capitulation to save lives and preserve what remained of the kingdom.[^30] On 5 July 1683, Feng Xifan ordered Zheng Dexiao to write a surrender document to the Qing Empire, and about ten days later, Feng sent Zheng Keshuang to meet with Admiral Shi Lang.[^31]

The surrender negotiations that Zheng Keshuang ultimately accepted demonstrated some success in securing favorable terms for Taiwan's population. On 5 September 1683, Shi Lang received Zheng Keshuang's formal offer to surrender, and on 3 October, he reached Taiwan and formally obtained the capitulation of Liu Guoxuan and Zheng Keshuang.[^32] Crucially, Shi Lang's party arrived in Taiwan on 5 October 1683 to supervise the surrender, and no one was executed—a remarkable clemency given the typical bloodshed that accompanied dynastic transitions in Chinese history.[^33] This peaceful transfer of power spared Taiwan from the devastation of prolonged warfare and allowed for a relatively orderly integration into the Qing administrative system.

The peaceful surrender also enabled the Kangxi Emperor to incorporate Taiwan into the Qing Empire, resolving a longstanding security threat to coastal Fujian province and ending decades of maritime piracy and Ming loyalist resistance that had plagued the early Qing dynasty.[^34]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Zheng Keshuang remains one of the most controversial figures in Taiwan's history, viewed by many as a weak puppet ruler who betrayed his grandfather's Ming loyalist cause. The circumstances of his rise to power through a violent coup that murdered his elder brother Zheng Kezang cast a shadow over the legitimacy of his reign from its inception.[^35] The fact that he was only twelve years old when installed as ruler meant that he was easily manipulated by powerful court officials, particularly his father-in-law Feng Xifan, who had orchestrated both the coup and his subsequent marriage to Feng's daughter.[^36]

Historical accounts offer scant specifics on his personal development or leadership qualities, with period records focusing primarily on dynastic and military affairs rather than the young prince's character or decision-making abilities.[^37] This absence of documentation about his personal agency reinforces the perception that he was a figurehead rather than an active ruler. Unlike his grandfather Koxinga, who made bold strategic decisions and personally led military campaigns, or even his father Zheng Jing, who maintained the kingdom for two decades, Zheng Keshuang's two-year reign left little evidence of independent leadership.

The most significant criticism centers on his decision to surrender to the Qing dynasty in 1683, effectively ending the Kingdom of Tungning and the last organized Ming loyalist resistance.[^38] For those who view the Zheng regime as defending Han Chinese sovereignty against Manchu conquest, this surrender represents the ultimate betrayal. Three months after Admiral Shi Lang inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Zheng base in the Pescadores in July 1683, the last resistance on Taiwan came to an end with Zheng Keshuang's capitulation, effectively ending the Zhengs' "piratical rebellion" against the Qing.[^39] The characterization of the Zheng resistance as "piratical" in Qing sources reflects the dynasty's view of the Ming loyalists as rebels and criminals rather than legitimate political actors.

Critics argue that a more resolute leader might have continued the resistance, using Taiwan's geographic separation from the mainland to sustain independence indefinitely. The island's natural defensive advantages, combined with the Zheng navy's traditional strength and the population's resistance to Qing rule, might have allowed for prolonged resistance or even permanent independence. However, such criticism may underestimate the catastrophic nature of the defeat at Penghu, where Liu Guoxuan's fleet was destroyed by Shi Lang's superior forces, effectively eliminating Tungning's naval power and leaving the island defenseless.[^40]

After the defeat, the Tungning royal court's split into "war" and "surrender" factions revealed deep divisions about the kingdom's future.[^41] While Zheng Keshuang ultimately sided with the surrender faction led by Feng Xifan and Liu Guoxuan, it remains unclear whether this represented his genuine judgment or simply acquiescence to advisors who controlled him.[^42] The fact that his own father-in-law led the surrender faction suggests that family pressures and court politics, rather than strategic assessment, may have determined the outcome.

Furthermore, Zheng Keshuang's subsequent comfortable life in Beijing as a Qing nobleman contrasts sharply with the sacrifice of earlier Ming loyalists who chose death over submission. While he was granted the hereditary title Duke of Hanjun and incorporated into the prestigious Plain Yellow Banner of the Eight Banners system, this reward can be seen as the price for his betrayal of the Ming cause his grandfather had championed.[^43] His descendants served as Bannermen in Beijing until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian, where they still live today—a legacy intertwined with both Ming loyalism and Qing collaboration.[^44]

---

## Personal Life

Zheng Keshuang's personal life was deeply intertwined with the political machinations of the Kingdom of Tungning's court. His marriage to the daughter of Feng Xifan was an arranged political union that solidified Feng's power as the young ruler's father-in-law.[^45] This marriage represented less a romantic partnership than a mechanism of political control, binding Zheng Keshuang to the faction that had orchestrated his rise to power through the violent elimination of his elder brother.

Historical records provide limited insight into Zheng Keshuang's personality, interests, or private thoughts. The painting depicting him playing chess with Chen Yonghua while dressed in light blue suggests participation in the refined cultural activities expected of a Confucian prince, but beyond this visual evidence, little documentation of his personal character survives.[^46] This absence in the historical record may reflect both his youth and his lack of agency as a puppet ruler controlled by court factions.

Zheng Keshuang was survived by three sons: Zheng Anfu (鄭安福), Zheng Anlu (鄭安祿), and Zheng Ankang (鄭安康).[^47] However, in a tragic end to his direct lineage, all three sons died without issue, meaning that the line did not continue through his direct descendants.[^48] This extinction of his direct male line represents a symbolic end to the active political legacy of his branch of the Zheng family, though broader Zheng family descendants continued to serve in the Qing Eight Banners and eventually returned to Fujian province.

After surrendering Taiwan to the Qing in 1683, Zheng Keshuang and his family were taken to the Qing imperial capital of Beijing to meet the Kangxi Emperor.[^49] Rather than facing execution—the typical fate of defeated rebels—he was granted remarkable clemency. The emperor made him a member of the Plain Yellow Banner (one source indicates the Plain Red Banner), one of the most prestigious divisions of the Eight Banners military-administrative system, and awarded him the hereditary title Duke of Hanjun (漢軍公; literally "duke of Han Eight Banners").[^50]

His subsequent life in Beijing as a Qing nobleman represents a dramatic transformation from ruler of an independent kingdom to a subordinate member of the conquering dynasty's aristocratic system. The Qing government's policy of incorporating rather than eliminating the Zheng leadership reflected the Kangxi Emperor's sophisticated approach to consolidating control—co-opting former enemies into the imperial system rather than creating martyrs who might inspire future resistance.

Zheng Keshuang died of illness in Beijing on 22 September 1707, at the age of 37.[^51] After his death, his younger brother, Zheng Kexue (鄭克壆), was ordered by the Qing government to bury the remains of Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) and Zheng Jing in Quanzhou, Fujian—the ancestral home of the Zheng family.[^52] This reburial symbolized the reintegration of the Zheng family into the Chinese mainland and the Qing imperial order, ending their exile in Taiwan and their resistance to Manchu rule.

## Legacy

Zheng Keshuang's legacy is complex and contested, reflecting broader tensions in how Taiwan's history and identity are understood and interpreted. As the ruler who surrendered Taiwan to the Qing dynasty, ending the Kingdom of Tungning and the last Ming loyalist resistance, he occupies an uncomfortable position in historical memory—neither hero nor simple villain, but rather a young man caught in impossible circumstances who made decisions with profound consequences for Taiwan's future.

While Zheng Keshuang himself receives relatively little direct attention in discussions of Taiwan identity compared to his legendary grandfather Koxinga, his actions directly shaped Taiwan's trajectory for the following two centuries.[^53] His surrender in 1683 initiated 212 years of Qing rule over Taiwan (1683-1895), during which the island was formally incorporated into the Chinese empire for the first time and underwent massive demographic and social transformation.

Following the defeat of the Ming loyalist Zheng Chenggong regime in 1683, the Qing dynasty initially debated whether to even retain Taiwan. The Manchu court in Beijing was hesitant to formally incorporate Taiwan into the Qing imperial order, with the Kangxi Emperor regarding the island as "a ball of mud beyond the pale of civilization" that did not appear on any map of the imperial domain until 1683.[^54] Opposition within the Qing government argued that Taiwan's maintenance would become an economic burden, that defending it was impossible, and that increasing defense expenditures was highly unfavorable.[^55] Some officials recommended abandoning the island entirely, and the Kangxi Emperor initially rejected proposals for annexation twice.[^56]

It was only after Admiral Shi Lang—the very man who had defeated Zheng Keshuang's forces—submitted a memorial outlining the dangers of leaving the island ungoverned that the emperor reconsidered.[^57] Shi Lang vehemently opposed abandoning Taiwan, arguing strategically that "Taiwan, though made up of multiple islands, in fact commands key strategic points across four provinces."[^58] Yao Qisheng also strongly favored annexation, stating that though Taiwan had not been part of China, the Zhengs had wreaked havoc on the mainland for 20 years after seizing it from the Dutch, and if Taiwan was relinquished, it would once again be occupied by rebels threatening the Chinese coast.[^59]

On 6 March 1684, Kangxi finally accepted Shi's proposal to set up permanent military establishments in Penghu and Taiwan, and on 27 May, the final recommendation for annexing Taiwan was accepted, establishing Taiwan Prefecture as a new prefecture of Fujian Province.[^60] Thus, paradoxically, Zheng Keshuang's defeat and surrender led directly to Taiwan's formal incorporation into China—a status it would maintain until cession to Japan in 1895.

During Qing rule (1683-1895), Taiwan underwent explosive Han Chinese migration despite initial restrictions, transforming from a lightly populated frontier into a densely settled agrarian society with over 2.5 million inhabitants by the late 19th century.[^61] Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1887, making it a province of China for only eight years from 1887 to 1895 before being ceded to the Empire of Japan following the First Sino-Japanese War.[^62]

The Zheng family legacy, including Zheng Keshuang's role, has been manipulated by different political regimes to serve various ideological purposes. In recent decades, as Taiwan's political landscape has continued to change, Koxinga's legacy has been shaped to conform to differing understandings of the cross-strait relation between China and Taiwan.[^63] The "One Country, Two Systems" model promoted by the People's Republic of China utilizes Koxinga's legacy as a symbol of Taiwan's historical unity with the mainland.[^64] Conversely, other perspectives in Taiwan, such as the Pan-Green Bloc, emphasize how Koxinga's resistance was a precursor to Taiwan's quest for autonomy.[^65]

Zheng Keshuang's descendants served as Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai Revolution toppled the Qing dynasty, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan'an in southern Fujian, where their descendants still live today.[^66] Notable among these descendants is poet Cheng Chou-yu, who was born in Shandong province and claimed to be one of Zheng's descendants.[^67] This scattered diaspora represents the physical legacy of a family that once ruled an independent kingdom but ultimately integrated into the imperial system they had resisted.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Defenders of Zheng Keshuang argue that his surrender to the Qing dynasty in 1683 represented a pragmatic decision that spared Taiwan from devastating warfare and preserved lives rather than pursuing futile resistance. The peaceful transfer of power, in which Shi Lang's party supervised the surrender and no one was executed, stands in stark contrast to the typical bloodshed accompanying dynastic transitions in Chinese history.[^68] This clemency suggests that the surrender negotiations achieved significant humanitarian objectives, protecting the civilian population from the horrors of prolonged siege and conquest.

Some historians emphasize the impossible circumstances Zheng Keshuang inherited: installed as a twelve-year-old puppet ruler through a violent coup that had murdered his elder brother, surrounded by court factions pursuing their own interests, and facing an overwhelmingly superior Qing military force after the catastrophic defeat at Penghu.[^69] From this perspective, criticizing Zheng Keshuang for surrendering is akin to blaming a child for adult failures—the Kingdom of Tungning's fate was sealed by structural weaknesses, internal divisions, and the Qing dynasty's consolidation of power long before the young prince made his final decision.

The orderly integration of Taiwan into the Qing administrative system following the surrender enabled the island's subsequent development and Han Chinese settlement over the following two centuries. While the Qing government initially relocated Chinese Han people who had lived in Taiwan during the Zheng regime back to China and strictly restricted immigration, over time Taiwan's population increased by over two million through cross-strait migrations, transforming it into a prosperous agricultural region.[^70] The relatively peaceful transition facilitated this development in ways that prolonged warfare might have prevented.

Furthermore, Zheng Keshuang's incorporation into the Qing Eight Banners system as Duke of Hanjun, along with his rattan shield troops who distinguished themselves at Albazin against Russian forces, demonstrates that his surrender enabled the preservation of Zheng military expertise and traditions within a new framework.[^71] Rather than total defeat and elimination, the surrender allowed for a form of continuity and honor within the victorious dynasty's system.

### Negative Views

Critics of Zheng Keshuang condemn him as a weak puppet ruler who betrayed the Ming loyalist cause his grandfather had championed and surrendered an independent kingdom without exhausting all options for resistance. Admiral Shi Lang, who conquered Taiwan, is generally denounced in Taiwan as a traitorous defector who abandoned the Ming loyalist cause for the Qing, and by extension, Zheng Keshuang's capitulation to this very traitor compounds the perception of betrayal.[^72] The characterization of the Zheng resistance by Qing sources as "piratical rebellion" reflects the dynasty's delegitimization of what Ming loyalists considered righteous resistance to foreign conquest.[^73]

The violent coup that brought Zheng Keshuang to power—in which his elder brother Zheng Kezang was murdered based on slanderous claims that he was not Zheng Jing's biological son—fundamentally compromised his legitimacy and revealed his status as a tool of court factions rather than a legitimate heir to the Zheng legacy.[^74] The fact that Feng Xifan, who orchestrated this coup, then arranged for Zheng Keshuang to marry his daughter and subsequently led the surrender faction, suggests a calculated political strategy in which the young ruler was merely a pawn.[^75]

Historical records' scant attention to Zheng Keshuang's personal development or leadership qualities reinforces the assessment that he functioned as a figurehead without genuine agency or capability.[^76] Unlike Koxinga, who displayed remarkable military genius, strategic vision, and personal charisma, or even Zheng Jing, who maintained the kingdom through two decades of challenges, Zheng Keshuang left no evidence of independent achievement or leadership. His two-year reign produced no significant reforms, military victories, or administrative innovations—only the final surrender.

The contrast between his comfortable subsequent life as a Qing nobleman in Beijing and the sacrifice of earlier Ming loyalists who chose death over submission highlights what critics see as personal cowardice or lack of commitment to the cause.[^77] His acceptance of the hereditary title Duke of Hanjun and integration into the Eight Banners system represented collaboration with the Manchu conquerors rather than principled resistance. The fact that his descendants served the Qing dynasty for over 200 years until its fall in 1911 suggests a complete abandonment of the Ming loyalist identity that had defined three previous generations of Zheng leadership.[^78]

From a Taiwan-centric perspective, Zheng Keshuang's surrender ended a period of de facto independence and initiated two centuries of mainland Chinese rule that would only end with cession to Japan in 1895. While Koxinga's resistance is sometimes viewed as a precursor to Taiwan's quest for autonomy, Zheng Keshuang's capitulation represents the opposite—the subordination of Taiwanese interests to mainland dynastic politics.[^79]

## Famous Quotes

While historical records document Zheng Keshuang's actions and the political decisions made during his reign, there are no recorded direct quotes or sayings attributed to him personally in surviving historical sources.[^80] The absence of documented quotes reflects several factors: his young age during his brief reign (12-14 years old), his status as a puppet ruler controlled by court factions, and the focus of period records on dynastic and military affairs rather than the personal words of subordinate princes.

However, contemporary sources do record statements from those around him that illuminate his circumstances:

> "Taiwan, though made up of multiple islands, in fact commands key strategic points across four provinces." - Admiral Shi Lang's memorial to the Kangxi Emperor arguing for Taiwan's annexation[^81]

This strategic assessment by the very admiral who defeated Zheng Keshuang's forces explains why the Qing ultimately decided to annex rather than abandon Taiwan following the surrender.

> "Though Taiwan had not been part of China, the Zhengs had wreaked havoc on the mainland for 20 years after seizing it from the Dutch, and if Taiwan was relinquished, it would once again be occupied by rebels threatening the Chinese coast." - Yao Qisheng's argument for annexation, 7 October 1683[^82]

This quote reveals how Qing officials viewed the Zheng regime as a persistent security threat that required permanent elimination through territorial incorporation.

> "Behold, the big-capped Tartars!" - Russian forces' frightened exclamation upon seeing Zheng Keshuang's former rattan shield troops swimming toward them at Albazin[^83]

This contemporary account demonstrates the fearsome reputation of the elite Tungning forces that were incorporated into Qing service after the surrender, representing one of the lasting military legacies of the Kingdom of Tungning.
