## Summary

Ibn Majah was a medieval Islamic scholar who compiled the Sunan Ibn Majah, the last of the six canonical hadith collections (Kutub al-Sittah) in Sunni Islam. His collection includes about 4,000 hadith, some of which are not found in the other five canonical collections. He traveled to Iraq, the Hijaz, Egypt, Syria, and other regions to gather traditions. His work remains an important reference in Islamic jurisprudence.
