## Summary

Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, perched on a mountain ridge 7,970 feet (2,430 m) above sea level. Built around 1450 by Inca emperor Pachacuti, it served as a royal estate and sacred religious site. The site features sophisticated dry-stone construction without mortar, with buildings perfectly fitted together. Abandoned around 1572 during Spanish conquest, Machu Picchu remained unknown to the outside world until American historian Hiram Bingham brought it to international attention in 1911. Often called the "Lost City of the Incas," it's one of the most iconic archaeological sites globally, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World (2007).

## Construction and Architecture

**Built c. 1450**:
- Emperor Pachacuti's royal estate
- 200 structures (temples, residences, storage, baths)
- **Urban sector**: Plazas, temples (Temple of the Sun)
- **Agricultural sector**: Terraces for farming
- **Population**: ~750 residents (nobles, priests, servants)

**Engineering:**
- Dry-stone walls (no mortar)
- Stones cut so precisely a knife blade can't fit between
- Earthquake-resistant (stones move, then resettle)
- Sophisticated water management (fountains, canals)
- Agricultural terraces prevented erosion

**Layout:**
- Divided by central plaza
- Sacred/royal district with temples
- Residential/industrial district
- Intihuatana stone (ritual astronomical clock)

---

## Purpose

**Theories:**
1. **Royal estate**: Emperor's retreat
2. **Religious site**: Sacred landscape, temples
3. **Astronomical observatory**: Aligned with solstices
4. **Administrative center**: Controlled surrounding region

Likely served multiple purposes.

## Abandonment

**Spanish Conquest (1532-1572)**:
- Spanish conquered Inca Empire
- Machu Picchu may have been abandoned during upheaval
- Spanish never found it (remote location saved it from destruction)
- Knowledge of site lost to outsiders

**Forgotten**:
- Locals knew of ruins
- Overgrown by jungle
- Outside world unaware

---

## Rediscovery

**Hiram Bingham III (1911)**:
- Yale historian led expedition
- Guided by local farmer Melchor Arteaga
- Publicized ruins internationally
- Excavated artifacts (controversy: Peru wants them returned from Yale)

**Misnomer**:
- Bingham thought it was Vilcabamba (last Inca refuge)
- Actually Vilcabamba was elsewhere
- "Lost City" is misnomer—locals knew about it

---

## Modern Era

**Tourism:**
- Peru's top tourist destination
- 1.5+ million visitors annually
- Concerns about over-tourism damaging site

**Conservation:**
- UNESCO World Heritage Site (1983)
- New Seven Wonders of the World (2007)
- Visitor limits, preservation efforts

**Access:**
- Train from Cusco to Aguas Calientes
- Bus or hike (Inca Trail) to ruins
- Inca Trail: 4-day trek, very popular

---

## Legacy

**Symbol:**
- Inca ingenuity, engineering
- Pre-Columbian American civilization
- Peru's national icon

**Questions:**
- How were massive stones transported up mountain?
- Exact purposes of all structures?
- Why this location chosen?
