## Summary

Yeongjo (born October 31, 1694; died April 22, 1776) was the 21st King of the Joseon Dynasty. His reign of **52 years** (1724–1776) was the longest in the dynasty's history.[^1] A brilliant and pragmatic ruler, Yeongjo is credited with restoring stability after decades of factional bloodshed through his **Tangpyeong** (Magnificent Harmony) policy. He reduced harsh punishments, reformed the tax system to help peasants, and promoted Confucian scholarship.[^2] However, his legacy is forever stained by the tragic **Imo Incident** of 1762, in which he ordered his own son, **Crown Prince Sado**, to be locked in a rice chest until he died of starvation.[^3]

## Early Life: The Prince of Humble Birth

Born **Yi Geum**, Yeongjo was the son of King Sukjong and **Consort Suk of the Choe clan**, a former water-maid in the palace.
*   **Stigma:** His mother's low status haunted him throughout his life, fueling his lifelong obsession with proving his legitimacy and competence as a Confucian monarch.[^4]
*   **Political Storm:** Before becoming king, he was Prince Yeoning. He survived the brutal power struggles between the Noron and Soron factions during his brother Gyeongjong's reign, constantly fearing assassination or execution for treason.[^5]

## The Tangpyeong Policy (Magnificent Harmony)

Upon ascending the throne in 1724, Yeongjo declared the **Tangpyeong Policy** to end the cycle of revenge politics (Hwanguk).
*   **Impartiality:** He actively balanced government appointments between rival factions (Noron and Soron) and erected the **Tangpyeongbi** (Monument of Magnificent Harmony) at the Sungkyunkwan National Academy to remind scholars of the virtue of harmony.[^6]
*   **Moderation:** He forbade factional disputes in court and severely punished officials who prioritized their party over the state.

## Reforms for the People

Yeongjo described himself as a "thin and frugal man" and implemented policies to aid the common people.
*   **Gyunyeokbeop (Equal Service Law):** In 1750, he drastically reduced the military cloth tax (which peasants had to pay) by half, relieving a major burden on the poor.[^7]
*   **Legal Reform:** He actively reduced cruel punishments. He outlawed **torture by searing** and required three rigorous trials for death penalty cases to prevent false accusations.[^8]
*   **Shinmun Drum:** He revived the **Shinmungo** drum system, allowing commoners to appeal directly to the king if they faced injustice.[^9]

## The Tragedy of Crown Prince Sado

The darkest chapter of Yeongjo's reign was his relationship with his son, **Crown Prince Sado**.
*   **Hope turned to Hate:** Yeongjo was a strict perfectionist who constantly berated his son. Sado developed severe mental illness, exhibiting violent behavior and killing palace staff.[^10]
*   **The Rice Chest (1762):** Fearing that Sado would destroy the dynasty, and unable to execute him as a criminal without staining the royal lineage, Yeongjo ordered him to climb into a wooden rice chest. Sado died after eight days of confinement in the summer heat.[^11] This event, known as the **Imo Incident**, remains one of the most debated tragedies in Korean history.

## Death and Legacy

Yeongjo died on **April 22, 1776**, at the age of 81. He was succeeded by Sado's son, **Jeongjo**.
*   **Assessment:** Despite the family tragedy, Yeongjo is fundamentally assessed as a wise and capable monarch who revived the Joseon Dynasty, strengthened royal authority, and improved the lives of his subjects through practical reforms.[^12]
