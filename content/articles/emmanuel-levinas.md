## Summary

Emmanuel Levinas was a Lithuanian-French philosopher who developed an ethics based on the encounter with the Other as the foundation of philosophy. His works Totality and Infinity and Otherwise than Being are among the most important philosophical texts of the 20th century. He also gave influential Talmudic lectures that bridged traditional Jewish learning and modern philosophy. His philosophy of the 'face of the Other' profoundly influenced ethics, theology, and political thought.
