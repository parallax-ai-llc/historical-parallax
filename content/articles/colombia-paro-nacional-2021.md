## Summary

On April 28, 2021, Colombia erupted. What began as a national strike against a proposed tax reform became the largest wave of protests in the country's recent history. For weeks, Colombians took to the streets in what they called the "Paro Nacional" (National Strike), demanding not just the withdrawal of the tax bill but fundamental changes to a society marked by inequality, police violence, and decades of conflict.[^1]

The protests revealed a country at breaking point. COVID-19 had devastated an already fragile economy. Poverty had surged. And when the government proposed raising taxes on the middle class to pay for the crisis, something snapped. Within days, the tax reform was withdrawn. But the protests continued—and so did the killing. At least 46 people died, many shot by police, particularly in the southwestern city of Cali, which became the epicenter of both protest and repression.[^2]

The Paro Nacional showed a new generation of Colombian protesters: young, diverse, connected by social media, and unafraid of a police force notorious for violence. It didn't bring down the government, but it transformed Colombian politics. One year later, Colombians would elect their first leftist president, Gustavo Petro—a trajectory directly connected to the streets of April 2021.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Colombia's Contradictions

**Decades of conflict:**
- Civil war (1960s-2016): FARC, ELN, paramilitaries
- 2016 Peace Agreement (partial)
- Ongoing violence in many regions

**Economy:**
- Middle-income country with extreme inequality
- One of most unequal in Latin America
- Poverty ~42% by 2020

**Government:**
- President Iván Duque (2018-2022)

- Unpopular before pandemic[^4]

### COVID-19 Impact

**By 2021:**
- Over 100,000 COVID deaths
- Economy contracted 7% (2020)
- Poverty increased dramatically
- Unemployment ~15%

**The pandemic created the conditions; the tax reform lit the match.**[^5]

### The Tax Reform

**April 2021:**
- Government proposed tax reform ("Ley de Solidaridad Sostenible")
- Aimed to raise $6 billion
- Expanded income tax base
- VAT on basic goods (including funerals, utilities)
