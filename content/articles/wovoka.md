## Summary

Wovoka (Jack Wilson) was a Paiute prophet who founded the Ghost Dance movement of 1890, one of the most significant Native American religious movements. He taught that performing the Ghost Dance would reunite the living with the spirits of the dead, restore traditional ways, and bring about the departure of European-Americans. The movement spread rapidly across the Plains tribes and was tragically linked to the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890.
