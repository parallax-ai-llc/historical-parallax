William Osler was a Canadian physician who is considered the father of modern clinical medicine. He revolutionized medical education by insisting that students learn at the bedside rather than solely from lectures. His textbook 'The Principles and Practice of Medicine' became the standard medical reference for decades. Osler was one of the four founding professors of Johns Hopkins Hospital.
