## Summary

Empress Dowager Cixi (1835-1908) was a Manchu noblewoman who became one of the most powerful women in Chinese history, wielding de facto control over the Qing Dynasty for nearly 50 years.[^1] Rising from a low-ranking concubine to become regent and effective ruler of China, she navigated internal rebellions, foreign invasions, and attempted to modernize the declining empire.[^2] Her legacy remains deeply contested—praised by some as the concubine who launched modern China, and condemned by others as a reactionary despot whose failures hastened the dynasty's collapse.[^3] She ruled during one of the most turbulent periods in Chinese history, from 1861 until her death in 1908, overseeing both modest reforms and catastrophic failures.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Empress Dowager Cixi was born on November 29, 1835, in Beijing to a Manchu family of the Yehe Nara clan.[^5] It is said that at birth she was called Yu Lan or "Little Orchid," though her true name remains unconfirmed.[^6] She was born into a family of Manchu government officials, and according to some historians, her father sought her advice and valued her opinion as highly as he would a son's, an unusual practice in traditional Chinese society.[^7]

Very little is known about her life before she arrived at the royal buildings of the Forbidden City in 1852, when she was sixteen years old.[^8] At that age, Cixi was presented by her family to be considered as a concubine to the newly crowned Chinese Emperor Xianfeng.[^9] Selected as a low-ranking consort, she left her family to live in the Forbidden City with the other women in the emperor's harem.[^10]

Cixi's ascendancy came at a time of internal chaos and foreign challenges, with the effects of the Second Opium War still hovering over the country.[^11] In September 1860, towards the end of the Second Opium War, British and French troops under the command of Lord Elgin attacked Beijing and burned down the magnificent Old Summer Palace.[^12] This traumatic event would shape Cixi's attitudes toward foreign powers throughout her life, as she personally remembered being forced to leave the capital during the Anglo-French invasion.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Cixi's path to power began in 1856 when she bore Emperor Xianfeng's only son, Zaichun, elevating her status from a low-ranking concubine to Noble Consort Yi.[^14] This gave her significant status within the imperial household at a critical moment in Chinese history.[^15] When Emperor Xianfeng died on August 22, 1861, his five-year-old son became the Tongzhi Emperor, and state business was initially placed in the hands of a regency council of eight elder officials appointed by the late emperor.[^16]

However, Cixi refused to accept this arrangement. A few months later, she orchestrated a dramatic coup d'état with Xianfeng's former senior consort, Ci'an, and Prince Gong, the former emperor's brother.[^17] The two women successfully overthrew the regents, imprisoning five of them, executing one, and ordering two to commit suicide.[^18] This coup is historically known as the Xinyou Coup because it took place in the xinyou year, the name of 1861 in the Chinese sexagenary cycle.[^19]

In breaking with tradition, Cixi became the only empress dowager in the Qing dynasty to assume the role of regent, ruling from behind the curtains.[^20] Noble Consort Yi was elevated to "Empress Dowager Cixi" and began what would become nearly five decades of control over the Chinese government.[^21] The two empress dowagers continued to act as co-regents, but after Ci'an's sudden death in 1881, Cixi became the sole holder of the office.[^22]

Cixi's influence extended far beyond the initial regency. Although the regency was officially terminated in 1873 after the Tongzhi Emperor attained maturity, her involvement in state affairs continued.[^23] Soon after Tongzhi's death in 1875, Cixi arranged to adopt her three-year-old nephew, Zaitian, and have him named the new heir; he became the Guangxu Emperor.[^24] Through these maneuvers, this girl from a minor Manchu clan, through both good fortune and unyielding determination, rose to power in China, ruling as regent from 1861 until her death in 1908.[^25]

## Major Achievements

### The Tongzhi Restoration and Self-Strengthening Movement

Following Prince Gong and Empress Dowager Cixi's coup, a period of reform was inaugurated known as the Tongzhi Restoration, which was also called the Self-Strengthening Movement.[^26] Following the devastating Taiping Rebellion in 1850, Empress Dowager Cixi conducted a series of reforms that sought to modernize China using imported Western machinery and weaponry.[^27] The idea was to start building up China's military capacity while maintaining traditional Confucian values—a policy summarized as "Chinese learning for fundamental principles, Western learning for practical application."[^28]

In a reversal of imperial tradition that demonstrated her pragmatic approach to governance, Cixi entrusted the country's most powerful military units into the hands of Han Chinese officials rather than exclusively Manchu nobles.[^29] At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials—Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and Zuo Zongtang—had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions.[^30] Regional leaders like Zeng Guofan established the Shanghai arsenal, Li Hongzhang built the Nanjing and Tianjin Arsenals, and Zuo Zongtang constructed the Fuzhou Dockyard.[^31]

Li Hongzhang, a Qing general who was more interested in the West than most of his kind, organized the formation and development of Western-style military academies, the construction of fortifications around Chinese ports, and the overhaul of China's northern fleet.[^32] In the 1860s and 1870s, regional armies began adopting Western drills and firearms.[^33]

### Post-Boxer Rebellion Reforms

After the catastrophic failure of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Cixi recognized the urgent need for comprehensive reform. In January 1902, she announced a series of reforms that shook up all aspects of Chinese life.[^34] Marriages between Han and Manchu partners were legalized for the first time.[^35] Foot-binding, a custom long practiced on Han girls that had crippled generations of Chinese women, was banned.[^36] Freedom of the press was expanded, allowing for greater public discourse.[^37]

In 1905, she abolished the Imperial Examination system that had been important for selecting Confucian scholars to be officials in the Empire for over a thousand years, opening the door for modern education.[^38] In 1906, Cixi announced that China would be transformed into a constitutional monarchy with elections, a revolutionary proposal for the ancient empire.[^39]

### Infrastructure and Economic Modernization

Under Cixi's leadership, the country began to acquire virtually all the attributes of a modern state: railways, electricity, telegraph, telephones, Western medicine, a modern-style army and navy, and modern ways of conducting foreign policy and diplomacy.[^40] She brought a myriad of reforms to the empire including expansion of foreign trade, and introduction of coal mining, telegraph, and electricity.[^41] Despite her initial hesitation about railways, she agreed to their construction for the sake of boosting trade.[^42]

Cixi's modernizing accomplishments included banning foot-binding, reforming the legal code and the education system, and outlawing barbaric punishments that had been standard practice in the Qing justice system.[^43] Later in life, she opened the Forbidden City to foreign guests for the first time, breaking centuries of isolation.[^44] In 1903, she allowed a young aristocratic photographer named Yu Xunling to take elaborately staged photographs of her and her court, which she used as diplomatic gifts to visiting dignitaries—Theodore Roosevelt and his daughter Alice received copies.[^45]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Suppression of the Hundred Days' Reform

One of Cixi's most controversial actions was her violent suppression of the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898. The reform was initiated by the Guangxu Emperor and led by reform-minded scholars, including Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao.[^46] Over roughly 100 days, the Guangxu Emperor enacted a series of imperial edicts aimed at restructuring government organization, reforming the civil service examination system, modernizing the army, and adopting elements of constitutional governance.[^47]

While Cixi reportedly supported the principles of the reforms, she feared that sudden implementation, without bureaucratic support, would be disruptive and permit the Japanese and other foreign powers to take advantage of China.[^48] On September 21, 1898, Empress Dowager Cixi and her allies staged a coup d'état, forcing the emperor under house arrest in a small palace on an island in the middle of Zhongnanhai linked to the rest of the Forbidden City only by a controlled causeway.[^49] Kang and Liang managed to escape to Japan, but six other young reformers were executed.[^50] The Guangxu Emperor's reign effectively came to an end, and he was forced to address Cixi as qin baba ("Dear Father"), to enforce an image that she was the fatherly figure in the household.[^51]

### The Boxer Rebellion Disaster

Cixi's support for the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 stands as one of the greatest failures of her reign.[^52] The Empress Dowager hated foreigners, remembering being forced to leave the capital when Anglo-French forces invaded Peking in 1860.[^53] She provided the Boxer rebels with funds for training and military weapons, despite the movement's anti-foreign and anti-government origins.[^54]

The move failed catastrophically after the Boxers attacked Beijing and were crushed by troops of the Eight Nations Alliance, forcing Cixi to don a disguise and flee Beijing for several months.[^55] During the anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion, Cixi was accused of personally encouraging the killing of foreigners and Chinese Christians.[^56] Cixi and the empire paid a heavy price, incurring over $330 million in reparations debt, plus a two-year prohibition of arms import.[^57] The Boxer Rebellion was widely regarded as the point of no return where the Qing empire stood powerless against foreign incursions.[^58]

### Misappropriation of Naval Funds

Another major criticism concerns the Summer Palace reconstruction. The Summer Palace had been destroyed by the English and French in the Second Opium War, and Cixi reportedly ordered up to 22 million silver taels, originally designated for upgrading the Qing navy (the Beiyang Fleet), to be used for reconstructing and enlarging the Summer Palace to celebrate her 60th birthday.[^59] After its restoration, the Empress Dowager made the Summer Palace her main residence, from which she oversaw governance of the empire.[^60] The diversion of naval funds to rebuild the Summer Palace became a controversial aspect of her legacy, with some historians suggesting it contributed to China's naval weakness in subsequent conflicts with Japan.[^61]

### Conservative Resistance to Reform

Throughout her reign, Cixi demonstrated a pattern of supporting reforms when politically convenient, then reversing course when they threatened her power.[^62] Her failures included suppressing the 1898 Hundred Days' Reforms, backing the disastrous Boxer Rebellion (1900), and failing to implement systemic reforms needed to save the dynasty until it was too late.[^63]

---

## Personal Life

Empress Dowager Cixi's personality was complex and often contradictory. She was described as either a great friend or terrible enemy, power hungry, ruthless, and profoundly skilled in court politics.[^64] Yet Cixi, though shrewd, also had great presence, charm, and graceful movements resulting in "an unusually attractive personality."[^65]

One court member observed: "She is very changeable; she may like one person today, tomorrow she hates the same person worse than poison."[^66] Another court member noted, "It was characteristic of Her Majesty to experience a keen sense of enjoyment at the troubles of other people."[^67] However, Cixi also showed loyalty, never forgetting a favor, keeping in the Palace a Chinese woman who nursed Her Majesty through a long illness and saved her life by giving her mother's milk to drink.[^68]

### Relationships and Family

Cixi's relationship with Empress Dowager Ci'an, Xianfeng's chief consort, was initially cooperative. The two became friends, and the relationship served them both well during their co-regency.[^69] Both the Tongzhi and Guangxu Emperors preferred the gentle Ci'an above Cixi, and her good-hearted personality was no match for Empress Dowager Cixi, who managed to sideline the naive and candid Empress Dowager Ci'an.[^70] After Ci'an's sudden death in 1881, Cixi became the sole regent, though some historians have speculated about the circumstances of Ci'an's demise.

There were significant tensions between Cixi and Arute, her son's empress, which was often a source of irritation for the Empress Dowager.[^71] Arute's zodiac symbol of tiger was perceived as life-threatening by the superstitious Cixi, whose own zodiac symbol was a goat.[^72]

### Personal Interests

Many officials showed more loyalty to the empress dowager than to the emperor, owing to her personalized approach to cultivating court favorites, many of whom would be given gifts of her artwork and invitations to join her at the theater for opera and acrobatics.[^73] The Dowager loved dogs and flowers, as well as boating, Chinese opera, and her Chinese water pipes and European cigarettes.[^74] She enjoyed creating elaborate photographic tableaux, in which she posed in famous roles from Peking Opera or as the compassionate bodhisattva Avalokitesvara.[^75]

For 37 of the 50 years Cixi spent in the Forbidden City, the emperors were minors and therefore under her control.[^76] She maintained her authority through a combination of political acumen, strategic alliance-building, and when necessary, ruthless elimination of opponents.

## Legacy

### Circumstances of Her Death

Empress Dowager Cixi died on November 15, 1908, only one day after Emperor Guangxu, who died just 22 hours before the 74-year-old Empress Dowager.[^77] The suspicious timing of these deaths has fueled speculation for over a century. In 2008, a report was issued by Chinese researchers and police officials confirming that the emperor had been deliberately poisoned with arsenic, with levels 2,000 times higher than those of ordinary people.[^78]

Although the report did not address who may have ordered his death, suspicion has long pointed toward the Empress Dowager, who feared that if Guangxu outlived her, he would restart his reforms and undo her work.[^79] Other suspects include Yuan Shikai, who feared Guangxu's retaliation, and Li Lianying, Cixi's chief eunuch, who was reportedly seen leaving the Empress Dowager's chambers with a special bowl of yogurt bound for the emperor's breakfast table on the morning of his death.[^80]

### Impact on Modern China

Cixi's legacy in shaping modern China is undeniable, though its nature remains contested. Some revisionist scholars, particularly Jung Chang, have argued that Cixi's legacy was manifold and towering, claiming that "most importantly, she brought medieval China into the modern age.... Her changes were dramatic and yet gradual, seismic and yet astonishingly bloodless."[^81] Under her leadership, China acquired railways, electricity, telegraph, telephones, Western medicine, modern military forces, and new approaches to diplomacy.[^82]

However, her legacy is also marked by catastrophic failures. The Boxer Rebellion disaster, the suppression of needed reforms, and her inability to fundamentally restructure the Qing government all contributed to the dynasty's eventual collapse just three years after her death.[^83] The 1911 Revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China can be partially attributed to the institutional weaknesses that persisted during her reign.[^84]

### Cultural and Historical Memory

Cixi's complex legacy is reflected in how she has been remembered across different periods and cultures. She was instrumental in both supporting and opposing modernization efforts in China, exemplified by her initial resistance to the Hundred Days' Reform followed by support for certain reforms after the Boxer Rebellion.[^85] Her approach reflected a struggle between maintaining tradition and embracing modernization, which shaped China's transition into the 20th century.[^86]

In popular culture and historical memory, she has often been portrayed as the "Dragon Lady"—a cruel, imperious figure opposed to reform.[^87] However, more recent scholarship has presented a more nuanced view, recognizing both her remarkable political skills in navigating a male-dominated society and her genuine, if limited, efforts at modernization.[^88]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Since the mid-1970s, views among scholars began to change, with Sue Fawn Chung's doctoral dissertation at University of California, Berkeley, being the first study in English to use court documents rather than popular histories and hearsay.[^89] Since then, the judgment on Cixi has somewhat altered, so that in general histories, by Jonathan Spence for instance, she appears as a more rounded figure.[^90]

Jung Chang's 2013 biography, *Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China*, based on newly available, mostly Chinese historical documents such as court records, official and private correspondence, diaries and eyewitness accounts, comprehensively overturned the conventional view of Cixi as a die-hard conservative and cruel despot.[^91] Chang presents Cixi in a far more positive light than earlier authors and has caused some to rethink assumptions regarding the late Qing period.[^92]

Defenders point to her pragmatic approach to governance, her willingness to employ talented Han Chinese officials like Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang despite Manchu prejudices, and her eventual acceptance of sweeping reforms after 1902.[^93] They note that she ruled during one of the most difficult periods in Chinese history, facing internal rebellions, foreign invasions, and the challenge of modernizing an ancient empire while preserving its essential character.[^94]

Some scholars emphasize that Cixi showed remarkable political acumen in a male-dominated society, maintaining power for nearly half a century through intelligence, strategic thinking, and careful cultivation of political alliances.[^95] Her post-1902 reforms—including the abolition of foot-binding, legal reforms, educational modernization, and the promise of constitutional government—demonstrated that she could embrace change when circumstances demanded.[^96]

### Negative Views

In the mid-1950s and for decades afterward, the Manchu Empress Dowager Cixi was invariably condemned as a reactionary hate figure, and leading American scholars characterized Cixi as cruel, imperious, and opposed to the Westernizing reforms championed by progressive officials.[^97] A Chinese friend of one scholar, in high school in Beijing in the 1970s, was taught that Cixi was a maiguozei, a traitor.[^98]

The most damaging and well-recognized negative portrayals were written in 1910 by Sir Edmund Backhouse and John Otway Percy Bland, two authors known for their anti-dynastic Chinese sentiment, though their accounts were later discredited as largely fabricated.[^99] Other negative sources came from Kang Youwei, who was a highly ambitious man with his own political interests and part of the anti-dowager faction that spawned countless rumors about Cixi.[^100]

Critics emphasize that Cixi's legacy is complex and that she is justly criticized for resisting necessary reforms that could have modernized China more effectively.[^101] They point to her suppression of the Hundred Days' Reform in 1898, when she crushed a promising modernization movement and executed six reformers simply because they threatened her power.[^102] Her support for the Boxer Rebellion was catastrophic, resulting in massive indemnities, territorial concessions, and a further erosion of Chinese sovereignty.[^103]

The misappropriation of naval funds for the Summer Palace reconstruction, her placing the Guangxu Emperor under house arrest for a decade, and the strong evidence that she ordered his poisoning the day before her own death all support the view of Cixi as a ruthless autocrat who placed personal power above the national interest.[^104] Chinese historians have adopted the balanced view that "During her lifetime, Empress Dowager Cixi performed both good and bad deeds; and we must accept and criticize them accordingly."[^105]

Some specialists have criticized even recent revisionist accounts, with Pamela Kyle Crossley arguing that Jung Chang's positive claims "seem to be minted from her own musings" and that Chang does not adequately engage with recent Western scholarship.[^106] The New York Times reported that a number of historians were wary of Chang's conclusions because the book was so laudatory of Cixi that the sources may not have been objectively assessed.[^107]
