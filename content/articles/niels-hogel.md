## Summary
Niels Högel was a German nurse and serial killer convicted of 85 murders of patients at hospitals in Delmenhorst and Oldenburg, Germany, between 1999 and 2005. He injected patients with lethal heart medication to cause cardiac arrest, then attempted to resuscitate them. He is one of the most prolific serial killers in modern history.

## Early Life
Born December 30, 1976, in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. He trained as a nurse. He was described as seeking recognition and attention from colleagues for his resuscitation skills. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1999 and 2005, Högel worked at hospitals in Oldenburg and Delmenhorst. He injected patients with medications such as ajmaline, lidocaine, and amiodarone to induce cardiac arrest. He then attempted to resuscitate them, seeking praise. When resuscitation failed, patients died. The actual death toll may exceed 300. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Colleagues became suspicious after noticing a correlation between Högel's shifts and patient deaths. He was caught in the act in June 2005 and initially convicted of six murders in 2015. A subsequent investigation involving the exhumation of hundreds of bodies led to his conviction for 85 murders in June 2019 — one of the largest murder trials in German history. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His case led to sweeping reforms in German hospital safety protocols [^4]
- Prompted mandatory reporting requirements for suspicious deaths in hospitals
- Led to criminal investigations of hospital administrators who failed to act on warnings

## Negative Perspectives
- Convicted of 85 murders, possibly over 300 [^5]
- Hospital administrators were charged for failing to report concerns
- Used medical knowledge to commit murders that initially appeared natural
- Sought praise and attention through the crisis situations he created
- Multiple opportunities to stop him were missed by hospital leadership
