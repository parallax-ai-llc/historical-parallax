## Summary

Kim Soon-duk (1921–2004), also known as Kim Tŏk-chin or Kim Sun-deok (김덕순), was a Korean survivor of the Japanese military sexual slavery system, a pioneering human rights activist, and an acclaimed artist whose vivid paintings became symbols of the comfort women movement. Abducted at age 16 in 1937 and forced into sexual slavery in Shanghai and Nanking for three years, Kim broke decades of silence to become one of the most visible advocates for justice. Her artwork, particularly her iconic painting "Unblossomed Flower," transformed personal trauma into powerful testimony, educating the world about the experiences of an estimated 200,000-410,000 women enslaved by the Japanese military during World War II.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Kim Soon-duk was born in 1921 into a poor family in South Kyongsang Province, in what was then Korea under Japanese colonial rule. The Japanese formal annexation of Korea in 1910 had marked the beginning of 35 years of colonial domination that would profoundly shape Kim's life and the lives of millions of Koreans. Her early childhood was marked by hardship and loss when her father died while she was still a child, leaving her mother to raise Kim and her four siblings in poverty.[^3][^4]

At the tender age of twelve, Kim was forced to work as a housemaid to help support her mother and siblings, sacrificing her own childhood to contribute to the family's survival. This experience of early labor and economic vulnerability would later make her susceptible to the predatory recruitment tactics employed by traffickers working in coordination with the Japanese military apparatus. Growing up during the height of Japanese colonization meant Kim experienced institutionalized racism, patriarchy, and the systematic exploitation of Korean resources and people that characterized this dark period of Korean history.[^5][^6]

The Japanese colonization of Korea, beginning in the 1910s, created the conditions that enabled the systematic trafficking of young Korean women into sexual slavery. Private recruiters—including both Japanese and Korean civilians—were hired by the Japanese government and military to locate and acquire young women, typically with false promises of education or good jobs. It was within this exploitative colonial system that Kim's fate would be sealed in 1937.[^7][^8]

## Abduction into Sexual Slavery

In 1937, at just 16 years old, Kim Soon-duk encountered a Korean man who presented what seemed like a lifeline out of poverty. He told her and approximately thirty other young women that they would be sent to Japan to work as well-paid factory workers—a common deceptive tactic used to lure victims. The promise of economic opportunity and a chance to help her struggling family proved irresistible to the teenage Kim. However, this promise was a cruel lie.[^9][^10]

Instead of taking the women to factory jobs in Japan, the Korean recruiter transported Kim and the other victims to a military brothel that he operated in Shanghai, and later moved them to another comfort station in Nanking (now Nanjing). These "comfort stations" were military-run brothels where women were subjected to systematic rape and sexual violence by Japanese soldiers. Kim would spend three horrific years, from 1937 to 1940, trapped in this system of sexual slavery.[^11][^12]

The brutality Kim experienced was so severe that she testified: "I tried to commit suicide twice." The conditions in the comfort stations were characterized by violence, disease, malnutrition, and the complete denial of basic human dignity. Women were forced to service dozens of soldiers daily, subjected to physical abuse, and denied freedom of movement. The trauma of these years would shape the rest of Kim's life, affecting her psychological well-being, her ability to form relationships, and her sense of self.[^13][^14]

During her captivity in Nanking, Kim developed a complex relationship with Izumi, a high-ranking Japanese officer in his fifties. In her own words, she came to rely on him "as her father, husband, and family"—a psychological adaptation to her captivity that reflects the complex survival strategies victims developed in impossible circumstances. This relationship would ultimately play a crucial role in securing her release.[^15][^16]

---

## Return to Korea and Decades of Silence

In 1940, due to Izumi's intervention motivated by what Kim described as his "love and concern," Kim Soon-duk and four other women from her village were able to return to Korea. Izumi provided Kim with 100 yen and official travel permits in a white envelope that allowed her and her peers to secure lodging, food, and travel by train, truck, and boat back to their homeland. This act of assistance from her captor illustrates the morally complex situations created by the comfort women system.[^17][^18]

After returning to Korea, Kim maintained correspondence with Izumi, receiving letters from him constantly and sending replies and care packages in return. She continued to receive his letters from Nanking until one or two years before Korea's liberation in 1945. These letters represented a connection to a traumatic past she could not escape. Tragically, Kim lost all these letters during the Korean War (1950-1953), which destroyed much physical evidence of the comfort women system.[^19][^20]

Upon her return to Korea, Kim faced the crushing burden of shame and stigma associated with being a former comfort woman. In Korean society, which placed tremendous emphasis on female chastity and honor, survivors of sexual violence faced ostracism, discrimination, and rejection—even though they were victims of war crimes. This social stigma forced Kim and thousands of other survivors into silence for nearly five decades. Many survivors never married, were unable to have children due to injuries and diseases contracted during their captivity, or lived in isolation to hide their past.[^21][^22]

During these decades of silence, Kim lived a quiet life, keeping her traumatic history secret from most people around her. The psychological toll of carrying this burden alone was immense, leading to what modern psychology would recognize as complex post-traumatic stress disorder. In the early 1990s, Kim lived in a rental house with other surviving comfort women, suggesting she may have found some community among fellow survivors even before publicly coming forward.[^23]

---

## Breaking the Silence and Activism

The movement to bring justice for comfort women began to gain momentum in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with South Korea's democratization. In November 1990, the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery by Japan was founded as a coalition of thirty-seven women's organizations, with the purpose of publicizing the issue and demanding that the Japanese government acknowledge the truth and provide justice.[^24][^25]

In 1991, Korean survivor Kim Hak-sun became the first woman to publicly testify on television about her experience as a comfort woman on August 14, 1991. This courageous act opened the floodgates for other survivors to come forward. Encouraged by Kim Hak-sun's testimony, Kim Soon-duk and other victims began to break their decades-long silence and share their ordeals with the world. August 14 is now commemorated as the International "Comfort Women" Memorial Day in honor of Kim Hak-sun's breakthrough.[^26][^27]

Kim Soon-duk became a devoted participant in the Korean Council's activism efforts. Beginning in January 1992, the Korean Council organized weekly Wednesday Demonstrations held at noon in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. These protests became the world's longest-running demonstration on a single theme, listed in the Guinness Book of Records in 2002. Kim was a faithful participant in these weekly protests, standing in solidarity with fellow survivors to demand acknowledgment, apology, and reparations from the Japanese government.[^28][^29]

On December 14, 2011, in commemoration of the 1,000th Wednesday Demonstration, the Korean Council installed the iconic "Peace Statue" (also known as the "Statue of a Girl") facing the Japanese Embassy in Seoul. This bronze statue, depicting a young girl in traditional Korean dress sitting in a chair with an empty seat beside her, has become a powerful global symbol of the comfort women movement and has been replicated in cities around the world.[^30]

In 1992, Kim Soon-duk moved into the House of Sharing with her friend Park Duri, who was five years her junior. The House of Sharing was established by the House of Sharing Establishment Committee in June 1992, holding its first opening ceremony in October 1992 at Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu, Seoul. After moving to several locations, the organization secured permanent land donated by Korea's Joggye Buddhist Order and prominent Buddhist businesswoman Cho Yong-ja. In December 1995, a spacious modern compound was completed in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province, on the outskirts of Seoul.[^31][^32]

The House of Sharing expanded into a five-building complex on 6,000 square meters, including residential wings, a recreation room, a Buddhist sanctuary, and educational facilities. In August 1998, the Museum of Sexual Slavery by Japanese Military opened its doors as the first museum in Korea dedicated to preserving the history and testimony of comfort women survivors.[^33][^34]

---

## Artistic Expression and Healing

One of Kim Soon-duk's most significant contributions to the comfort women movement came through her art. Beginning in 1993, artist Gyung-shin Lee proposed a series of art courses for survivors living at the House of Sharing. After some residents moved out, Lee continued the course with three surviving comfort women, including Kim Soon-duk and fellow survivor-artist Kang Duk-kyung (1929-1997). This art therapy program provided survivors with a powerful medium to process their trauma and share their experiences with the world.[^35][^36]

After her return to Korea decades earlier, Kim had taken an art class as part of trauma therapy and began producing colorful and provocative paintings. In her own words about this artistic process: "Once I expressed my past, which I had kept inside for a long time, my wounds seemed to heal." Art became both a therapeutic outlet and a form of testimony that transcended language barriers and touched hearts globally.[^37][^38]

Kim Soon-duk and Kang Duk-kyung received tremendous attention during the earlier years of the movement for their distinct, vivid paintings depicting the lives and stories of comfort women. Their artwork used powerful symbolism, particularly flowers, to represent the destroyed virginity and stolen youth of the victims. Kim Soon-duk produced some of the most memorable works in the comfort women artistic movement, including her two most famous paintings: "Unblossomed Flower" and "Stolen Away."[^39][^40]

In Kim's iconic painting "Unblossomed Flower," a vine of magnolia buds entwines the body of a sad young woman. As Kim explained at age 79: "That's me. The flower hasn't blossomed. I was taken at a very young age. That's when my life was destroyed." The painting served as both a self-portrait and a means for Kim to express her trauma after keeping her story secret for decades. The unblossomed flower became a powerful metaphor for the lives cut short, the futures stolen, and the innocence destroyed by the comfort women system.[^41][^42]

"Unblossomed Flower" took on a life beyond its creation, becoming emblematic of the struggles of colonial Korea and the comfort women movement worldwide. The painting has been routinely displayed and gifted internationally, taking on a significant political role. It even inspired the statue of the young girl that stands in the center of the House of Sharing grounds, creating a permanent memorial to the victims.[^43][^44]

Kim's other notable work, "Stolen Away," similarly depicted the experiences of abduction and loss that characterized the comfort women system. Together with Kang Duk-kyung's paintings like "Stolen Chastity" and "Punish the Responsible" (which featured cherry trees symbolizing Japan), these artworks created a visual archive of testimony that educated the public about historical atrocities in ways that written or spoken words alone could not achieve.[^45][^46]

---

## International Advocacy and Speaking Tours

Kim Soon-duk expanded her activism beyond Korea's borders, embarking on international speaking tours to raise awareness about the comfort women issue. She traveled abroad to attend exhibits displaying her paintings, participated in speaking engagements, and testified about her experiences to international audiences. When asked why she broke her silence after so many years, Kim stated: "Many years passed and I was always wondering, was it my part to testify against this horrific experience? It would just cause pain for my family and friends. But, one by one, women were coming out into the public to talk about Japanese sexual slavery."[^47][^48]

Kim made several trips to the United States, including a significant visit in September 2001 to speak at a conference in San Francisco marking 50 years since the San Francisco Peace Treaty. She sought to meet with the State Department to voice her opposition regarding legal cases involving comfort women and to advocate for justice. In 2000, she shared her wartime experiences at an art show at the San Francisco Arts Commission Gallery, where she described the brutal conditions the women faced and displayed her powerful artwork.[^49][^50]

Kim also went on international speaking tours that brought her to Toronto, Canada, and other cities around the world. Through these testimonials and artwork exhibitions, she educated international audiences about a dark chapter of history that many were unaware of or chose to ignore. Her willingness to relive her trauma repeatedly for educational purposes demonstrated extraordinary courage and commitment to ensuring that the world would never forget what happened to her and hundreds of thousands of other women.[^51][^52]

In the 1990s, Kim became actively involved with the Korean Council for the Women Drafted for Sexual Slavery in Japan, which organized not only the weekly protests in Seoul but also international advocacy campaigns. She participated in movements against sexual slavery and war rape more broadly, connecting the historical injustice she suffered to contemporary issues of sexual violence in conflict zones around the world.[^53][^54]

---

## Legal Battles and the Quest for Justice

The comfort women survivors' quest for justice included numerous legal battles in multiple jurisdictions. In December 1991, shortly after Kim Hak-sun's groundbreaking testimony, 35 members of the Association of Korean Victims filed a lawsuit in Tokyo District Court against the Japanese government for violating their human rights during World War II. Three of the plaintiffs were former comfort women, demanding an official apology, compensatory payment of ¥20 million each, a thorough investigation, textbook revisions, and the construction of a memorial museum.[^55][^56]

The Tokyo District Court dismissed the case in March 2001, with Presiding Judge Shoichi Maruyama acknowledging the suffering of the plaintiffs but finding that individual victims' claims for damages against the victimizer country were not cognizable under international law. In a rare partial victory, in April 1998, a Japanese court ruled that compensation be awarded to comfort women and ordered the Japanese government to pay ¥300,000 each to three plaintiffs. However, this victory was short-lived, as the Supreme Court nullified the ruling in March 2003.[^57][^58]

Survivors also attempted to seek justice in U.S. courts. In September 2000, fifteen former comfort women filed a class action lawsuit before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit—the only lawsuit on the matter filed in a U.S. court. The district court granted Japan's motion to dismiss on the basis that Japan enjoyed sovereign immunity under international law, blocking survivors' access to American justice.[^59][^60]

In South Korean courts, lawsuits continued into the 21st century with mixed results. On January 8, 2021, Seoul Central District Court ordered the government of Japan to pay reparations of 100 million won ($91,300) each to the families of twelve women—a landmark ruling that rejected Japan's claim of sovereign immunity. However, in April 2021, a different judge at the same court rejected an effort to order Japan to compensate 20 comfort women and their relatives, citing state immunity. On November 23, 2023, the Seoul High Court rendered a judgment in favor of plaintiffs, and the judgment was confirmed on December 9, 2023.[^61][^62]

On June 26, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee passed House Resolution 121, calling on Japan to "formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner" for the comfort women system. This represented significant international pressure on Japan, though it had no binding legal effect.[^63]

---

## Personal Life and Relationships

Kim Soon-duk's personal life was profoundly shaped by her experiences as a comfort woman. The available historical records do not indicate that she ever married or had children—a common outcome for many survivors who faced social stigma, physical injuries, and psychological trauma that made traditional family life difficult or impossible. The shame and discrimination directed at comfort women survivors in Korean society meant that many chose to remain single rather than risk rejection or the exposure of their past.[^64][^65]

At the House of Sharing, Kim found companionship and community among fellow survivors. Her friendship with Park Duri, who moved into the House of Sharing with her in 1992, was particularly significant. Park Duri, who was five years younger than Kim, would often jokingly salute her elder and turn to her for advice and assistance. This relationship reflected the sisterhood that developed among the women who shared the experience of survival and activism.[^66][^67]

Kim's personality comes through in her art and testimony as determined, resilient, and committed to truth-telling despite the pain it caused. Her willingness to create paintings depicting her trauma, to speak publicly about deeply personal violations, and to travel internationally to share her story demonstrated remarkable strength of character. The fact that she maintained her activism until the very day of her death speaks to her unwavering dedication to the cause of justice.[^68]

The relationship with Izumi, the Japanese officer who facilitated her return to Korea, remained a complex part of her life story. The correspondence they maintained after her return, until shortly before Korea's liberation, suggests a complicated bond that defies simple categorization. This relationship has been the subject of scholarly analysis regarding the psychological adaptations victims made to survive their captivity and the morally ambiguous situations created by the comfort women system.[^69][^70]

---

## Death and Memorial

On Wednesday, June 30, 2004, Kim Soon-duk passed away at the age of 83. Poignantly, she died on the very day of her weekly journey to Seoul to participate in the Wednesday Demonstration—a testament to her lifelong commitment to activism. Even in her final hours, Kim remained dedicated to the cause she had championed for over a decade of public advocacy.[^71][^72]

A Buddhist ceremony commemorated her death in the House of Sharing's shrine, reflecting the Buddhist principles of compassion and the support the Buddhist community had provided to the comfort women survivors through the donation of land and resources for the House of Sharing. Her passing was mourned by fellow activists, survivors, and supporters of the comfort women movement around the world.[^73][^74]

Kim Soon-duk was laid to rest having achieved significant recognition for her contributions, though the ultimate goal of full justice and acknowledgment from the Japanese government remained elusive. The Wednesday Demonstrations she faithfully attended continued after her death and persist to this day, with only one missed protest since 1992—during the Kobe earthquake in Japan in 1995, when organizers chose not to demonstrate out of respect for Japanese victims of the natural disaster.[^75]

---

## Legacy and Impact

Kim Soon-duk's legacy extends far beyond her lifetime, profoundly shaping the comfort women movement, feminist activism, and historical memory in Korea and internationally. Her artistic contributions created a visual language for discussing sexual violence and historical trauma that has educated millions of people worldwide who might never have understood the comfort women issue through text alone.[^76][^77]

The iconic "Unblossomed Flower" painting remains one of the most recognizable symbols of the comfort women movement. As it has been displayed and gifted internationally, the piece has taken on a political role, becoming emblematic of the struggles of colonial Korea and the ongoing quest for justice. The statue it inspired at the House of Sharing serves as a permanent memorial ensuring that future generations will learn about this history.[^78][^79]

Kim's participation in the Wednesday Demonstrations helped establish what became the world's longest-running protest on a single theme. These demonstrations fundamentally changed the discourse around comfort women in South Korea and internationally, transforming it from a hidden shame to a recognized historical injustice and human rights issue. The demonstrations continue today, with new generations of activists joining aging survivors to demand justice.[^80][^81]

The House of Sharing, where Kim lived from 1992 until her death, has become a crucial site of memory and education. The museum that opened in 1998 houses artworks by Kim and other survivors, along with historical documents, testimony recordings, and educational materials. Thousands of visitors, including international tourists, students, and researchers, visit annually to learn about the comfort women system and meet with survivors while they were still alive.[^82][^83]

Kim's international advocacy work helped globalize the comfort women issue, contributing to the installation of comfort women memorials and peace statues in cities around the world, including San Francisco, Los Angeles, Berlin, Manila, and many others. These memorials keep the history alive in public spaces and continue to generate diplomatic tensions, ensuring the issue cannot be forgotten or ignored.[^84][^85]

Her artistic methodology—using art therapy to process trauma and transform it into powerful testimony—has influenced how human rights organizations, therapists, and educators approach working with survivors of sexual violence and conflict-related trauma. The model developed at the House of Sharing has been studied and adapted in contexts ranging from the Democratic Republic of Congo to the Balkans.[^86]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views and Recognition

Scholars and human rights advocates have praised Kim Soon-duk as a pioneering figure in breaking the silence surrounding wartime sexual violence. Her courage in coming forward, despite the social stigma and psychological difficulty, paved the way for thousands of other survivors globally to share their stories and seek justice. Feminist scholars have analyzed her artwork as a powerful form of testimony that challenges patriarchal narratives about "honor" and "shame" by reclaiming survivors' right to speak their truth.[^87][^88]

Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have highlighted the testimony and activism of survivors like Kim as essential to establishing sexual violence as a war crime and crime against humanity in international law. The advocacy work Kim participated in contributed to groundbreaking developments such as the International Criminal Court's recognition of rape and sexual slavery as crimes against humanity.[^89][^90]

Art historians and critics have celebrated Kim's paintings as powerful examples of outsider art and trauma art that deserve recognition not only for their historical significance but also for their aesthetic and emotional impact. The Museum of Comfort Women and academic institutions have exhibited her work, analyzing how her use of color, symbolism, and composition communicates experiences that defy conventional verbal expression.[^91][^92]

Korean feminist movements have honored Kim and other comfort women survivors as symbols of resistance against both Japanese imperialism and Korean patriarchy. The comfort women movement has been credited with catalyzing broader conversations about sexual violence, victim-blaming, and women's rights in South Korean society, contributing to the powerful feminist wave that emerged in South Korea in the 2010s and 2020s.[^93][^94]

International advocates for women's rights have pointed to Kim's legacy as demonstrating the power of survivor-centered advocacy. Rather than allowing others to speak for them, Kim and fellow survivors insisted on telling their own stories in their own words and through their own artistic expression, modeling an approach to advocacy that centers the voices and agency of those most affected by injustice.[^95]

### Criticisms and Controversies

While Kim Soon-duk herself has not been the subject of significant criticism, the comfort women movement she participated in has faced opposition and controversy. Japanese historical revisionists and right-wing nationalists have denied that comfort women were coerced into prostitution, with some claiming they were voluntary, contracted sex workers. These denialist narratives have been thoroughly debunked by historical evidence, but they continue to circulate, particularly in Japan.[^96][^97]

In 2021, Harvard Law School professor J. Mark Ramseyer published a paper claiming that comfort women were "recruited, contracted sex workers" rather than sex slaves, generating international controversy and widespread academic condemnation. Historians and Korean studies experts issued statements refuting Ramseyer's claims and documenting the extensive evidence of coercion, abduction, and systematic sexual violence. Such academic revisionism continues to cause pain to survivors and their advocates.[^98][^99]

The Japanese government, led by conservative Liberal Democratic Party politicians, has consistently maintained that the issue was "settled completely and finally" with the 1965 Agreement with South Korea and "resolved finally and irreversibly" with the 2015 bilateral agreement. Japan has strongly opposed comfort women memorials and educational materials as "one-sided attacks" that harm Japan's international standing. Under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, references to comfort women were removed from Japanese textbooks, reversing earlier progress.[^100][^101]

Some critics have questioned aspects of survivor testimony, pointing to minor inconsistencies in accounts given decades after traumatic events. However, trauma specialists note that such variations are entirely consistent with how traumatic memory functions and do not undermine the core truth of the systematic sexual slavery system. The overwhelming documentary evidence, including military records and contemporary accounts, corroborates survivors' testimonies.[^102][^103]

Within the comfort women movement itself, there have been controversies regarding the 2015 agreement between Japan and South Korea, which provided 1 billion yen to a foundation supporting survivors. Many survivors, including some who knew Kim, rejected this agreement because it did not acknowledge violations of human rights law, did not accept legal responsibility, lacked a genuine apology, and was negotiated without full participation of the victims. This internal disagreement reflects the complexity of achieving justice for historical atrocities.[^104][^105]

UN human rights experts have criticized both the 2015 agreement and Japan's ongoing refusal to accept legal responsibility. In March 2016, UN experts urged Japan to implement recommendations made by the UN Committee on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which called for Japan to recognize victims' rights to remedy, provide full and effective redress and reparation, including compensation and official apologies, and ensure victims' views are taken into account.[^106][^107]
