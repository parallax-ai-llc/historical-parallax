## Summary

Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (1746-1828) was a Spanish Romantic painter and printmaker who is widely considered one of the most important artists in Western art history and the last of the Old Masters. Beginning as a court painter to the Spanish Crown, Goya's work evolved from cheerful rococo tapestry designs to dark, haunting visions that anticipated modern art movements. His unflinching depictions of war's brutality in works like "The Third of May 1808" and "The Disasters of War" series revolutionized how conflict was portrayed in art. Despite suffering from a mysterious illness that left him deaf at age 46, Goya continued producing masterworks including his enigmatic "Black Paintings" that explored humanity's darkest impulses and psychological depths with unprecedented honesty.

## Early Life and Background

Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes was born on March 30, 1746, in the small village of Fuendetodos in Aragon, Spain, approximately 40 kilometers southwest of Zaragoza[^1]. He was the fourth of six children born to José Benito de Goya y Franque, a gilder of modest means, and Gracia de Lucientes y Salvador, who came from a family of minor Aragonese nobility[^2]. The family's economic circumstances were humble, with his father working as a master gilder, decorating altarpieces and other church furnishings[^3].

Around 1749, when Goya was still a young child, the family moved to Zaragoza, where greater opportunities existed for his father's gilding trade[^4]. In Zaragoza, the young Francisco attended the Escuelas Pías de San Antón, a school run by the Piarist fathers, where he received a basic education alongside his lifelong friend Martín Zapater, with whom he would maintain an extensive correspondence throughout his life[^5].

At the age of fourteen in 1760, Goya began his formal artistic training as an apprentice to José Luzán y Martinez, a local painter trained in the late Baroque tradition in Naples[^6]. Under Luzán's tutelage for approximately four years, Goya studied drawing from casts and copying prints and paintings, learning the fundamentals of composition and technique that would serve as the foundation for his artistic development[^7]. Luzán's workshop exposed the young artist to the religious painting traditions that dominated Spanish art at the time.

In 1763 and again in 1766, Goya traveled to Madrid with aspirations of winning a scholarship from the prestigious Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando, but he failed to achieve recognition on both occasions[^8]. These early rejections, however, did not deter his artistic ambitions. Around 1769-1771, Goya made the journey to Italy, a traditional pilgrimage for aspiring artists seeking to study the masterworks of the Renaissance and Baroque periods[^9]. During his Italian sojourn, he studied the works of the great masters in Rome and possibly participated in competitions at the Parma Academy, where he received an honorable mention in 1771 for a painting in the neoclassical style[^10].

Upon returning to Spain in 1771, Goya received his first significant commission to paint a fresco in the Church of Our Lady of the Pillar in Zaragoza, marking the beginning of his professional career[^11]. These early works showed the influence of both his Spanish training under Luzán and his exposure to Italian painting traditions, though they had not yet developed the distinctive style that would later characterize his mature work.

## Rise to Prominence

Goya's ascent to prominence began in earnest in 1773 when he married Josefa Bayeu, the sister of Francisco Bayeu, one of Spain's leading painters and a court painter to King Charles III[^12]. This strategic marriage connected Goya to influential artistic circles in Madrid and opened doors that would prove instrumental to his career advancement. Through his brother-in-law's connections, Goya relocated to Madrid permanently in 1775 and secured a position creating cartoons (full-scale preparatory drawings) for the Royal Tapestry Factory of Santa Bárbara[^13].

For the next seventeen years, from 1775 to 1792, Goya produced over sixty tapestry cartoons depicting scenes of daily Spanish life, leisure activities, and popular celebrations[^14]. These works, including masterpieces such as "The Parasol" (1777), "The Pottery Vendor" (1779), and "The Maja and the Cloaked Men" (1777), showcased his ability to capture the vibrancy and color of Spanish popular culture in the rococo style favored by the court[^15]. The tapestry cartoons brought Goya steady income and increasing visibility among Madrid's elite, demonstrating his technical mastery and imaginative compositional skills.

Goya's reputation continued to grow throughout the 1780s as he expanded beyond tapestry designs to portraiture and religious commissions. In 1780, he was unanimously elected to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando—the same institution that had twice rejected him in his youth[^16]. His admission piece, "Christ Crucified" (1780), demonstrated his mastery of academic painting conventions while hinting at the emotional intensity that would characterize his later work[^17].

The turning point in Goya's career came in 1786 when King Charles III appointed him as one of the official painters to the king (Pintor del Rey), a prestigious position that brought substantial financial rewards and social prestige[^18]. This appointment represented the culmination of years of strategic networking, consistent production, and demonstrated excellence. In this role, Goya began receiving portrait commissions from the highest echelons of Spanish aristocracy and the royal family itself.

When Charles IV ascended to the throne in 1788 following his father's death, Goya's position became even more secure. In 1789, the new king promoted Goya to Court Painter (Pintor de Cámara), one of the most coveted artistic positions in Spain[^19]. This elevation placed him on equal footing with his former brother-in-law and mentor Francisco Bayeu and granted him access to the intimate circles of the royal court. In this capacity, Goya created numerous official portraits of the royal family, including the magnificent group portrait "Charles IV of Spain and His Family" (1800-1801), which has been both praised for its technical brilliance and scrutinized for its unflattering honesty in depicting the royal subjects[^20].

During this period of rising prominence, Goya also cultivated relationships with Spain's intellectual elite, the ilustrados (enlightened ones), who embraced Enlightenment ideals of reason, progress, and social reform[^21]. His friendships with liberal thinkers such as Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, a prominent statesman and writer, and the Duchess of Alba, one of Spain's most powerful aristocrats, broadened his intellectual horizons and influenced the increasingly critical social commentary that would appear in his work[^22].

By the early 1790s, at the age of forty-five, Goya had achieved everything an artist of his era could aspire to: financial security, aristocratic patronage, royal favor, academic honors, and social prestige. However, a mysterious illness in 1792-1793 would transform both his life and his art in profound and unexpected ways.

## Major Achievements

Goya's artistic achievements span multiple mediums and genres, with innovations that fundamentally altered the trajectory of Western art. His work can be divided into several major categories, each representing groundbreaking contributions to artistic expression.

**Portraiture and Court Painting**

As Court Painter, Goya produced some of the most psychologically penetrating portraits in art history. His portrait work departed from the flattering conventions of court painting by revealing the character, personality, and even the flaws of his subjects with unprecedented honesty[^23]. "Charles IV of Spain and His Family" (1800-1801) stands as both a masterpiece of compositional complexity—echoing Velázquez's "Las Meninas"—and a subtly subversive commentary on royal power, depicting the royal family with such unflinching realism that some scholars have interpreted it as satire[^24].

His portraits of individual aristocrats, such as the "Duchess of Alba" (1797) and "The Countess of Chinchón" (1800), combined technical brilliance with psychological depth, capturing not merely the physical appearance but the inner life of his subjects[^25]. His series of portraits depicting Manuel Godoy, the controversial Prime Minister and royal favorite, demonstrated Goya's ability to navigate the dangerous political waters of court life while maintaining artistic integrity[^26].

**The Caprichos and Social Criticism**

In 1799, Goya published "Los Caprichos" (The Caprices), a series of eighty aquatint etchings that represented a revolutionary departure from his court work[^27]. These prints offered biting social commentary on the superstitions, ignorance, corruption, and follies of Spanish society, targeting the Catholic Church, the aristocracy, the Inquisition, and popular superstitions with equal ferocity[^28]. The most famous image, "The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters" (Capricho 43), depicts a man (possibly the artist himself) asleep at his desk while nightmarish creatures—owls, bats, and a lynx—swarm around him, embodying the dangers of abandoning rational thought[^29].

The Caprichos employed innovative printmaking techniques, combining etching and aquatint to create dramatic contrasts between light and dark that enhanced their psychological impact[^30]. Though Goya initially offered them for public sale, he withdrew them after only two weeks, possibly fearing Inquisition prosecution, though he later donated the plates to the Royal Chalcography in exchange for a pension for his son[^31].

**War and Political Commentary**

Goya's most powerful and historically significant works emerged from Spain's traumatic experience during the Peninsular War (1808-1814), when Napoleon's forces invaded Spain, triggering a brutal conflict that combined conventional warfare with savage guerrilla resistance[^32]. His responses to this catastrophe produced two of the most important anti-war statements in art history.

"The Third of May 1808" (1814) depicts the execution of Spanish resisters by French forces following the Madrid uprising[^33]. The painting's composition—with its Christ-like victim in a white shirt facing the faceless firing squad, his arms raised in a pose suggesting crucifixion—transformed the traditional history painting genre by focusing not on heroic generals but on the anonymous victims of political violence[^34]. The work's emotional immediacy, dramatic lighting, and unflinching portrayal of state-sanctioned killing influenced generations of artists and established new possibilities for politically engaged art[^35].

"The Disasters of War" (Los Desastres de la Guerra), created between 1810 and 1820 but not published until 1863, thirty-five years after Goya's death, comprises eighty-two prints depicting the horrors of the Peninsular War with shocking directness[^36]. Unlike traditional war imagery celebrating military glory, these prints show rape, mutilation, starvation, execution, and the degradation of human dignity that war produces[^37]. Images such as "Great deeds! Against the dead!" (showing mutilated corpses impaled on a tree) and "One cannot look at this" (depicting a woman about to be raped) strip away all romantic illusions about warfare[^38]. The series concludes with allegorical prints criticizing the political situation in post-war Spain, suggesting that the restoration of Ferdinand VII had betrayed the ideals for which Spaniards had fought[^39].

**The Black Paintings**

Between 1819 and 1823, while living in his country house known as the Quinta del Sordo (House of the Deaf Man), the aging, deaf, and increasingly isolated Goya painted fourteen murals directly onto the walls of his home[^40]. These paintings, later transferred to canvas and now housed in the Prado Museum, represent perhaps the most enigmatic and psychologically intense works in his entire oeuvre[^41].

The "Black Paintings" (so named for their dark pigments and somber themes) include such disturbing images as "Saturn Devouring His Son," showing the Titan consuming his child's headless body; "Two Old Men Eating Soup," depicting aged figures with death-like features; and "Witches' Sabbath," showing a goat-headed devil presiding over a coven[^42]. These works abandoned conventional beauty, narrative clarity, and even rational composition in favor of nightmarish visions that seem to emerge from the unconscious mind[^43].

Never intended for public viewing, these paintings represent Goya's most personal artistic statement, created for himself alone during a period of political repression under Ferdinand VII's absolutist restoration[^44]. Their psychological intensity, formal experimentation, and willingness to confront humanity's darkest impulses anticipated Expressionism, Surrealism, and other twentieth-century movements by nearly a century[^45].

**Technical Innovation**

Throughout his career, Goya pioneered new techniques in printmaking, particularly in aquatint, which he used with unprecedented sophistication to create tonal variations and atmospheric effects[^46]. He also experimented with lithography, a recently invented printing technique, producing some of the earliest artistic lithographs in the 1819 series "The Bulls of Bordeaux"[^47]. In painting, his increasingly loose brushwork and emphasis on expressive color over precise drawing in his later works pointed toward Impressionism and influenced artists from Édouard Manet to Pablo Picasso[^48].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his undeniable genius, Goya's life and work have generated considerable controversy and criticism, both during his lifetime and in subsequent scholarly assessment.

**Political Opportunism**

Goya's ability to maintain his position and prosperity through Spain's dramatic political upheavals—serving both the liberal-leaning court of Charles IV and the repressive absolutist regime of Ferdinand VII, while also accepting a medal from the French occupiers—has led some critics to question his political integrity[^49]. During the French occupation (1808-1813), Goya swore loyalty to Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother installed as King of Spain, and received the Royal Order of Spain from the French regime[^50]. After the restoration of Ferdinand VII, he claimed he had never truly supported the French and managed to retain his position as court painter, though he was investigated for his wartime activities[^51].

This political flexibility has been interpreted variously as pragmatic survival, moral cowardice, or evidence of a fundamentally apolitical nature focused primarily on preserving his ability to work[^52]. While his art, particularly "The Disasters of War," suggests deep sympathy with liberal ideals and horror at political violence, his personal conduct during the period suggests a willingness to accommodate whichever regime held power[^53].

**Relationship with the Duchess of Alba**

Goya's relationship with María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva, the 13th Duchess of Alba, has been the subject of intense speculation and controversy since the eighteenth century[^54]. The beautiful and powerful duchess served as Goya's patron and possibly his lover during the mid-1790s, with Goya spending several months at her estate in 1796-1797 following the death of her husband[^55]. Some scholars have identified her as the model for the famous "Naked Maja" and "Clothed Maja" (circa 1797-1800), a pair of paintings depicting the same woman nude and clothed in identical poses[^56].

The paintings themselves created scandal, as the "Naked Maja" was one of the first European paintings to depict pubic hair and to show a nude woman unambiguously looking at the viewer rather than posed as a mythological figure[^57]. The works led to Goya being summoned before the Spanish Inquisition in 1815 to explain who had commissioned them and who the model was—questions he apparently never fully answered[^58]. The relationship with the duchess, whether platonic or romantic, has been seen by some as evidence of social climbing and exploitation of aristocratic patronage[^59].

**Treatment of Religious Subjects**

While Goya produced numerous religious paintings throughout his career, his approach to sacred subjects became increasingly unorthodox and occasionally provocative[^60]. His later religious works often emphasized the suffering, grotesque, or superstitious aspects of religious practice rather than conventional piety, as seen in works like "Christ on the Mount of Olives" (1819) and various paintings of Saint Francis Borgia performing exorcisms surrounded by hideous demons[^61].

The anticlerical satire in "Los Caprichos" and other works positioned Goya at odds with the Spanish Catholic Church's temporal power, though scholars debate whether his criticism targeted religious corruption and superstition or religion itself[^62]. Some contemporary critics found his treatment of religious themes disrespectful or even blasphemous, contributing to the Inquisition's interest in his work[^63].

**Misogyny in Representation**

Modern feminist art historians have identified problematic elements in Goya's representation of women, particularly in "Los Caprichos" and other print series[^64]. While he created sympathetic portraits of individual women, his allegorical and social commentary works often depicted women as vain, manipulative, prostitutes, or witches, reinforcing negative stereotypes prevalent in his era[^65]. Critics note that while Goya satirized many aspects of Spanish society, his representation of women's agency and sexuality often deployed conventional misogynistic imagery rather than challenging it[^66].

**Mental Health and the Black Paintings**

The psychological state that produced the Black Paintings has been the subject of considerable speculation, with some critics suggesting they represent evidence of mental illness, depression, or paranoia[^67]. While this psychological reading has enriched understanding of the works' emotional power, it has also been criticized for pathologizing artistic innovation and for using outdated psychoanalytic frameworks to interpret complex artworks[^68]. Some scholars argue that viewing these paintings primarily through the lens of Goya's mental state diminishes their deliberate artistic and philosophical sophistication[^69].

**Incomplete Social Criticism**

Despite his reputation as a progressive artist critical of Spanish society's injustices, Goya never extended his social criticism to challenge the fundamental structures of aristocratic privilege that supported him[^70]. While he satirized individual nobles' follies and criticized specific abuses, he continued to depend on aristocratic patronage and never questioned the legitimacy of the social hierarchy itself[^71]. His criticism remained safely within the bounds of enlightened reformism rather than revolutionary transformation, leading some scholars to view his social commentary as limited and ultimately conservative[^72].

## Personal Life

Goya married Josefa Bayeu on July 25, 1773, in Madrid, when he was twenty-seven and she was likely in her early twenties[^73]. The marriage, which lasted until Josefa's death in 1812, was by most accounts a practical rather than passionate union, arranged at least partially to advance Goya's artistic career through connection to the Bayeu family[^74]. Josefa, known as Pepa, came from a family of painters; her brothers Francisco and Ramón Bayeu were both prominent artists in Madrid's artistic establishment[^75].

The couple had at least seven children, though only one, Francisco Javier Pedro (born 1784), survived to adulthood[^76]. The high infant and child mortality was typical of the era but undoubtedly affected the family deeply. Goya's correspondence rarely mentions his wife or domestic life, suggesting either a distant marital relationship or simply the conventions of eighteenth-century letter-writing that separated public professional identity from private domesticity[^77]. His extensive letters to his childhood friend Martín Zapater, however, provide glimpses into his daily life, health concerns, and social activities, revealing a man deeply engaged with Madrid's cultural and intellectual circles[^78].

**The Illness and Deafness**

In late 1792, while visiting Cádiz, Goya suffered a mysterious and severe illness that left him partially paralyzed, nearly blind, and suffering from hallucinations and terrible headaches for several months[^79]. Although he gradually recovered most of his faculties, the illness left him permanently and profoundly deaf at the age of forty-six[^80]. The exact nature of this illness remains debated, with various scholars proposing lead poisoning from paint pigments, syphilis, Ménière's disease, or other conditions, but no definitive diagnosis has been established[^81].

The deafness profoundly affected Goya's psychology and artistic development. Isolated from casual conversation and increasingly withdrawn from Madrid's social world, he turned inward, developing a more personal, imaginative, and ultimately revolutionary artistic vision[^82]. In a letter to a friend, Goya wrote that during his convalescence he had occupied himself "with observations that normally there is no opportunity to make and in which fantasy and invention have no place," suggesting the illness catalyzed a new commitment to observation and truth-telling that would characterize his mature work[^83].

**Relationships and Character**

Beyond his wife, Goya maintained several significant relationships that shaped his life and work. His friendship with Martín Zapater, which lasted from childhood until Zapater's death in 1803, produced over 130 surviving letters that provide invaluable insights into Goya's personality, daily life, and evolving attitudes[^84]. These letters reveal a man who could be crude, humorous, ambitious, anxious about money despite his success, and deeply concerned with maintaining his social position[^85].

His relationship with the Duchess of Alba, whether or not it was romantic, clearly affected him deeply. After her sudden death in 1802 at age forty, Goya painted her image from memory in several works and included references to her in his private albums[^86]. His relationships with liberal intellectuals like Jovellanos, Ceán Bermúdez, and Leandro Fernández de Moratín positioned him within Spain's enlightened elite and influenced the social criticism in his work[^87].

Goya's personality, as revealed through letters and contemporary accounts, was complex and sometimes contradictory. He could be charming and sociable in aristocratic circles while also being prickly about his professional dignity and quick to perceive insults to his status[^88]. Despite his deafness and increasing isolation, he maintained a vigorous social life when he chose to engage, attending tertulias (intellectual gatherings) and maintaining his position at court[^89].

**Later Life and Exile**

After his wife's death in 1812, Goya lived with his housekeeper Leocadia Weiss, who was approximately thirty-five years his junior and separated (though not divorced) from her husband[^90]. Leocadia had a daughter, Rosario, whose paternity has been attributed to Goya by some biographers, though this remains unproven[^91]. This unconventional household arrangement—an elderly deaf artist, his much younger companion, and her child—further isolated Goya from conventional society[^92].

In 1824, at age seventy-eight, Goya left Spain for France, ostensibly for health reasons but actually to escape the oppressive political climate under Ferdinand VII's restored absolutism[^93]. He settled in Bordeaux, where a community of Spanish liberal exiles had gathered, and lived there for the final four years of his life[^94]. During this period, he continued working with remarkable energy, experimenting with lithography and producing his final masterpiece series, "The Bulls of Bordeaux" (1825)[^95].

He died on April 16, 1828, in Bordeaux at the age of eighty-two, with Leocadia and his son Javier at his side[^96]. He was initially buried in Bordeaux, but in 1899 his remains were exhumed for transfer to Spain—though mysteriously, his skull was missing from the coffin, leading to one of art history's enduring bizarre mysteries[^97]. His body (minus the head) was eventually interred in the San Antonio de la Florida chapel in Madrid, whose dome he had painted with magnificent frescoes in 1798[^98].

## Legacy

Goya's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime achievements to encompass his fundamental influence on the entire trajectory of modern art. His willingness to confront uncomfortable truths, to depict the irrational and nightmarish alongside the beautiful, and to use art as a vehicle for social and political commentary established new possibilities for what art could be and do[^99].

**Influence on Modern Art**

Virtually every major art movement of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries can trace some lineage to Goya's innovations. The Romantic movement found in his work a model for expressing intense emotion, individualism, and fascination with the irrational and supernatural[^100]. Eugène Delacroix and Théodore Géricault both studied Goya's prints and incorporated his dramatic contrasts and emotional intensity into their own work[^101].

The Realist movement, particularly in France, drew inspiration from Goya's unflinching depiction of social reality and his focus on contemporary subjects rather than historical or mythological themes[^102]. Édouard Manet, often called the father of modern painting, explicitly acknowledged Goya as a primary influence and borrowed compositional elements from works like "The Third of May 1808" for his own "Execution of Emperor Maximilian" (1868)[^103].

The Impressionists and Post-Impressionists responded to Goya's increasingly loose brushwork and emphasis on expressive color over precise drawing in his later works[^104]. His technical freedom and willingness to leave brushstrokes visible rather than blending them into smooth, academic finishes anticipated their own technical innovations[^105].

Most profoundly, the Expressionist and Surrealist movements of the early twentieth century recognized Goya as a spiritual ancestor who had explored the unconscious, the irrational, and the nightmarish with unprecedented courage[^106]. André Breton, author of the Surrealist Manifesto, identified Goya as a precursor to Surrealism, while German Expressionists saw in the Black Paintings and Disasters of War a model for art that confronted psychological and social reality without flinching[^107].

Pablo Picasso, perhaps the twentieth century's most influential artist, repeatedly returned to Goya throughout his career, creating variations on "Las Meninas" by Velázquez and the "Majas," and drawing on Goya's anti-war imagery for "Guernica" (1937), his own masterpiece protesting political violence[^108]. Francis Bacon, the British painter of disturbed and disturbing figures, cited Goya as a primary influence on his exploration of human suffering and psychological extremity[^109].

**Political and Social Impact**

Beyond formal artistic influence, Goya's work has served as a continuing reference point for artists and activists confronting war, political oppression, and social injustice. "The Third of May 1808" has been repeatedly referenced, quoted, and adapted by artists responding to political violence, from Édouard Manet to contemporary photographers documenting modern conflicts[^110]. The visual language Goya developed for depicting the reality of warfare—focusing on victims rather than heroes, showing violence's degradation rather than its glory—has become a standard approach for anti-war art[^111].

His prints, particularly "Los Caprichos" and "The Disasters of War," demonstrated that printmaking could serve as a medium for social commentary and political dissent, accessible to broader audiences than unique paintings[^112]. This model influenced later print traditions from Honoré Daumier's political lithographs to twentieth-century protest graphics[^113].

**Institutional Recognition**

The Museo del Prado in Madrid, one of the world's great art museums, houses the most extensive collection of Goya's work, including "The Third of May 1808," "The Black Paintings," and numerous portraits[^114]. The museum's holdings constitute a pilgrimage site for artists and art lovers, establishing Goya as a central figure in Spain's cultural patrimony alongside Velázquez and El Greco[^115].

His work appears in major museums worldwide, from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York to the National Gallery in London, ensuring that new generations continually encounter his vision[^116]. The San Antonio de la Florida chapel in Madrid, which Goya frescoed in 1798, has been preserved as both his burial place and a monument to his artistic achievement[^117].

**Scholarly and Critical Legacy**

Goya has been the subject of extensive scholarly attention, with thousands of books, articles, and dissertations examining every aspect of his life, work, and influence[^118]. This scholarship has evolved from early hagiographic approaches that emphasized his isolated genius to more contextualized studies that situate him within Enlightenment thought, Spanish political history, and the social dynamics of his era[^119].

Recent scholarship has employed feminist, postcolonial, and psychoanalytic approaches to Goya's work, generating new interpretations and occasionally contentious debates about how to understand his treatment of gender, class, and political violence[^120]. The continued vitality of Goya studies demonstrates that his work remains generative of new meanings and insights rather than becoming a closed historical topic[^121].

**Popular Culture**

Beyond academic and artistic circles, Goya has entered popular consciousness as a romantic figure—the deaf genius creating nightmarish masterpieces in isolation, the court painter who became a revolutionary artist, the man who unflinchingly depicted war's horrors[^122]. This popular image, while sometimes simplifying the historical complexity of his life, has ensured that his name remains recognizable even to those unfamiliar with art history[^123].

Films, novels, and plays have fictionalized his life, particularly his relationship with the Duchess of Alba and his creation of the Black Paintings, cementing his status as a cultural icon beyond his artistic achievement[^124]. The phrase "the sleep of reason produces monsters" has entered common usage as a warning about the consequences of abandoning rational thought[^125].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Art historians and critics have consistently recognized Goya as one of the supreme artistic geniuses in Western art history, with many placing him alongside Rembrandt, Velázquez, and Michelangelo in the pantheon of greatest painters[^126]. His technical mastery across multiple media—painting, drawing, and printmaking—combined with his psychological depth, social insight, and formal innovation have earned him nearly universal acclaim within the art historical community[^127].

The influential critic and historian Kenneth Clark described Goya as "the first great artist whose work reflects, with full consciousness, the tensions and contradictions of modern life," positioning him as the first truly modern artist who recognized and expressed the psychological and social fragmentation that would characterize the modern era[^128]. This view emphasizes Goya's role as a transitional figure who bridged the Old Master tradition and the revolutionary innovations of modern art[^129].

Scholars have particularly praised Goya's moral courage in confronting subjects that other artists avoided or sanitized. His willingness to depict war's brutality, political corruption, and human suffering with unflinching honesty has been celebrated as evidence of both artistic integrity and deep humanistic values[^130]. Art historian Robert Hughes wrote that Goya "invented the rhetoric of suffering" and created "an imagery of catastrophe which has not been surpassed, and perhaps not even equaled, in the nearly two hundred years since he made it"[^131].

His technical innovations have been extensively documented and praised, particularly his sophisticated use of aquatint to create atmospheric tonal effects in printmaking and his increasingly free, expressive brushwork in painting that anticipated Impressionism and Expressionism[^132]. The French poet and critic Charles Baudelaire, writing in the mid-nineteenth century, praised Goya's ability to combine the real and the fantastic, noting that "no one has ventured further than he in the direction of the possible absurd"[^133].

Goya's influence on subsequent art has been recognized as both profound and enduring, with virtually every major modern artist acknowledging his importance either explicitly or through visual quotation[^134]. The art historian Fred Licht argued that "Goya's importance as an innovator is matched by his importance as a great summation of the past," suggesting that his work both completed certain artistic traditions while opening entirely new possibilities[^135].

From a political perspective, liberal and progressive scholars have celebrated Goya as an artist who used his work to criticize authoritarianism, superstition, and social injustice, positioning him as an Enlightenment figure committed to reason, progress, and human dignity[^136]. His anti-war imagery has been particularly valued in this context as expressing universal humanitarian values that transcend particular political positions[^137].

Spanish national pride has embraced Goya as one of Spain's greatest cultural figures, with his work representing Spanish artistic achievement to the world and his unflinching depiction of Spanish history during the Napoleonic period serving as a powerful national narrative of resistance and suffering[^138]. The Prado Museum's Goya holdings are considered among Spain's most valuable cultural treasures[^139].

### Negative Views

Despite widespread acclaim, Goya has faced criticism from various perspectives. Some critics have argued that the emphasis on his psychological complexity and modernist innovations has been overstated, suggesting that his work remains fundamentally rooted in eighteenth-century artistic and intellectual traditions rather than representing a radical break with the past[^140]. This revisionist view sees Goya as a late Baroque artist who happened to live long enough to be claimed by modern art movements rather than as a genuine modernist avant la lettre[^141].

Conservative critics, both contemporary to Goya and in later periods, have objected to his darkness, his emphasis on the grotesque and horrific, and his apparently pessimistic view of human nature[^142]. From this perspective, his obsession with violence, superstition, and human degradation represents a morbid sensibility rather than courageous truth-telling, and his rejection of traditional beauty and idealization represents a failure rather than an innovation[^143].

Some art historians have questioned the coherence of Goya's artistic vision, noting the dramatic differences between his cheerful rococo tapestry cartoons, his sophisticated court portraits, his savage political satires, and his nightmarish Black Paintings[^144]. Rather than seeing this range as evidence of growth and complexity, these critics suggest it reveals an artist without a consistent philosophical or aesthetic position, willing to adapt his style to whatever circumstances required[^145].

His political opportunism—serving multiple regimes with conflicting ideologies while maintaining his position and privileges—has led some historians to question interpretations of his work as expressing deep political commitments[^146]. From this perspective, "The Disasters of War" and other apparently political works may represent personal horror at violence rather than specific political convictions, and his social criticism in "Los Caprichos" may be more about securing his reputation among enlightened elites than genuine reformist commitment[^147].

Feminist art historians have critiqued Goya's representation of women, noting that while he could create sympathetic individual portraits, his allegorical and satirical works often deployed conventional misogynistic imagery without critical distance[^148]. His famous "Majas" have been criticized as objectifying the female body for male pleasure, and his witch imagery in various works has been seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes about female sexuality and power[^149].

Some scholars have argued that the celebration of Goya's "The Disasters of War" as anti-war art is anachronistic, imposing modern pacifist values on works that may have been intended as partisan propaganda supporting Spanish resistance rather than as universal humanitarian statements[^150]. This reading suggests that Goya's horror at French atrocities did not necessarily extend to a general opposition to warfare or political violence[^151].

Technical critics have occasionally noted weaknesses in Goya's draftsmanship compared to neoclassical contemporaries like Jacques-Louis David, suggesting that his loose, expressive style sometimes masked deficiencies in academic drawing skills[^152]. While admiring his coloristic and compositional abilities, these critics suggest that his reputation has benefited from modern preferences for expressiveness over academic precision[^153].

Finally, some postcolonial scholars have noted Goya's lack of engagement with Spain's colonial enterprises and the absence of critique of Spanish imperialism in his social commentary, suggesting that his progressive vision had significant blind spots regarding issues of race and empire[^154]. His social criticism remained focused on metropolitan Spanish concerns without extending to the violence of colonial administration or the Atlantic slave trade in which Spain participated[^155].

## Famous Quotes

> "Fantasy abandoned by reason produces impossible monsters; united with her, she is the mother of the arts and the origin of their marvels." - Caption for "The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters" (Capricho 43), 1799[^156]

This is Goya's most famous statement about the relationship between reason and imagination, suggesting that artistic creativity requires both rational control and imaginative freedom, while reason without imagination produces sterility and imagination without reason produces nightmares.

> "I have had three masters: Nature, Velázquez, and Rembrandt." - Attributed statement about his artistic influences[^157]

This quote, while possibly apocryphal, captures Goya's artistic lineage and priorities: direct observation of reality (Nature), Spanish painting tradition (Velázquez), and psychological depth combined with technical mastery (Rembrandt).

> "The dream of reason produces monsters." - Alternative translation of Capricho 43 caption[^158]

This alternate translation of his most famous caption emphasizes a different interpretation: that reason itself, when taken to extremes or when it sleeps, can produce its own form of monstrosity, a warning against both irrationality and cold rationalism.

> "I see only forms that are lit up and forms that are not, planes which advance and planes which recede, relief and depth." - Statement about his approach to painting[^159]

This quote reveals Goya's increasing emphasis on visual perception and painterly effects rather than precise linear drawing, anticipating Impressionist approaches to capturing optical experience.

> "Time will tell whether I have painted anything of value." - Letter to Martín Zapater, expressing uncertainty about his legacy[^160]

Despite his success during his lifetime, Goya apparently felt genuine uncertainty about whether his work would endure, a modesty that seems remarkable given his subsequent canonical status.
