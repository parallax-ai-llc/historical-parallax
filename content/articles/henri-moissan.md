## Summary

Henri Moissan was a French chemist who won the 1906 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for isolating fluorine and developing the electric arc furnace. Fluorine had resisted isolation for decades due to its extreme reactivity. His electric furnace enabled study of high-temperature chemistry and synthesis of artificial diamonds.
