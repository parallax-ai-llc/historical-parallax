## Summary

Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale was a Sikh preacher and militant leader who became the central figure in the Sikh separatist movement in the 1980s. He initially had support from Indian political figures before becoming an increasingly radical advocate for Sikh rights and autonomy. He occupied the Akal Takht complex within the Golden Temple in Amritsar. He was killed during Operation Blue Star, the Indian Army's assault on the Golden Temple, an event that profoundly traumatized the Sikh community.
