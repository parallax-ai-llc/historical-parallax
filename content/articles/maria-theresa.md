## Summary

Maria Theresa (1717-1780) was the only female ruler of the Habsburg dominions and one of the most formidable monarchs of eighteenth-century Europe. Ascending to power in 1740 amid a succession crisis that sparked the War of Austrian Succession, she successfully defended her inheritance against powerful male rivals including Frederick II of Prussia. Over her forty-year reign, she modernized the Austrian state through extensive administrative, military, financial, and educational reforms while remaining a devoutly Catholic and deeply conservative ruler. Though never officially empress in her own right—the title came through her husband Francis I—Maria Theresa wielded absolute power and transformed Austria into a centralized, efficient state capable of competing with Prussia and France. Her legacy remains profoundly complex: celebrated as a state-builder and mother of sixteen children, yet criticized for religious intolerance, particularly toward Jews and Protestants, and for ruthlessly pursuing dynastic interests through strategic marriages of her children, most notoriously Marie Antoinette.

## Early Life and Background

Maria Theresa was born on May 13, 1717, in Vienna, the second child but eldest surviving daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI and Elisabeth Christine of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel[^1]. Her birth came at a crucial time for the Habsburg dynasty, which faced an existential succession crisis. Having no male heirs, Charles VI spent much of his reign securing approval for the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, a decree that would allow his daughters to inherit the Habsburg lands despite traditional male-preference primogeniture laws that governed most European monarchies[^2].

As a young archduchess, Maria Theresa received an education befitting a Habsburg princess, though not one designed to prepare her for sovereign rule. She was taught languages, including Latin, Italian, French, and Spanish, studied history, and received instruction in music and the arts—she was an accomplished singer and loved dancing[^3]. However, she received little training in statecraft, military affairs, or political philosophy, subjects reserved for male heirs. Her father, convinced the Pragmatic Sanction would hold despite its fragility, failed to adequately prepare his daughter for the challenges of rulership[^4].

Maria Theresa's upbringing was shaped by the rigid formality and intense Catholicism of the Habsburg court. She developed a deep personal piety that would characterize her entire reign and inform many of her most controversial policies[^5]. Unlike many aristocratic women of her era, she grew close to her mother and developed strong family bonds that later influenced her approach to motherhood and her strategic use of dynastic marriages. Her childhood was spent in the splendor of Schönbrunn Palace and the Hofburg, insulated from the political machinations that would soon engulf her.

The young archduchess was described as beautiful, with blonde hair, blue eyes, and a commanding presence despite her relatively small stature. Contemporary accounts emphasize her charm, vivacity, and strong will—characteristics that would prove essential when she assumed power[^6]. Her marriage in 1736 to Francis Stephen of Lorraine, whom she had loved since adolescence, was both a love match and a political alliance. Francis was forced to renounce his ancestral duchy of Lorraine in exchange for the eventual succession to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, demonstrating the cold realpolitik that governed even Maria Theresa's personal happiness[^7].

## Rise to Power

Maria Theresa's accession to power in October 1740, following her father's death, immediately plunged Europe into crisis. Despite the Pragmatic Sanction, which had been guaranteed by most European powers, her inheritance was challenged almost immediately. Frederick II of Prussia, who had just become king, seized the opportunity to invade the wealthy Habsburg province of Silesia in December 1740, sparking the War of Austrian Succession (1740-1748)[^8]. He was soon joined by France, Bavaria, Spain, and Saxony, all seeking to partition Habsburg territories or advance competing succession claims.

At twenty-three, Maria Theresa found herself ruling a vast but fragmented empire stretching from present-day Belgium to Hungary, from Bohemia to northern Italy, while simultaneously facing invasion from multiple directions. She inherited a nearly bankrupt treasury, a demoralized and poorly equipped army, and a bureaucracy riddled with inefficiency[^9]. Her advisors, largely holdovers from her father's reign, were often defeatist and counseled compromise. Most European observers expected the young, inexperienced woman to quickly capitulate and accept a diminished inheritance.

Instead, Maria Theresa displayed remarkable determination and political acumen. In one of the most famous episodes of her reign, she traveled to Pressburg (modern Bratislava) in September 1741 to appeal directly to the Hungarian nobility for support. Appearing before the Diet in mourning dress and holding her infant son Joseph in her arms, she delivered an emotional appeal in Latin, calling upon Hungarian chivalry to defend her rights[^10]. The Hungarian magnates, moved by her appeal and concerned about Bavarian and French designs on their own privileges, pledged "our life and blood" (Vitam et sanguinem) to her cause, providing crucial military support that helped turn the tide of the war[^11].

Maria Theresa proved to be a shrewd diplomat and determined war leader. She navigated complex alliance systems, eventually securing British and Dutch support against France and Prussia. She appointed capable military commanders like Field Marshal Leopold Joseph von Daun and personally involved herself in strategic planning, mastering details that many of her advisors had dismissed as beyond a woman's capacity[^12]. Though the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748 forced her to cede Silesia to Prussia—a loss she never accepted and spent much of her reign attempting to reverse—she successfully defended the bulk of her inheritance and secured recognition of her husband Francis as Holy Roman Emperor in 1745[^13].

The survival of Habsburg power against such overwhelming odds established Maria Theresa's reputation and provided her with the political capital necessary to undertake sweeping reforms. The war had exposed the profound weaknesses of the Habsburg state, and she was determined never again to face such vulnerability. Her rise from besieged and dismissed young woman to respected European monarch demonstrated both her personal capabilities and the underestimation her enemies had made—a mistake they would not repeat[^14].

## Major Achievements

Maria Theresa's reign is distinguished by comprehensive state modernization that transformed the Habsburg domains into a more centralized, efficient, and powerful monarchy capable of competing with Prussia and France. Her reform program, developed largely in response to the challenges exposed by the War of Austrian Succession, touched virtually every aspect of government and society[^15].

Her administrative reforms fundamentally restructured Habsburg governance. She created the Directorium in publicis et cameralibus in 1749, merging the previously separate Austrian and Bohemian chancelleries into a unified central administration, thereby reducing the autonomy of individual Habsburg territories[^16]. This centralization extended to tax collection, which was standardized across her domains and significantly increased state revenue. Under her guidance, ministers like Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Haugwitz implemented systematic cadastral surveys to determine accurate property values for taxation, reducing noble tax exemptions and ensuring more equitable revenue collection[^17].

Military reform was among Maria Theresa's highest priorities. She established the Theresian Military Academy in Wiener Neustadt in 1752, creating a professional officer corps educated in modern military science rather than relying solely on aristocratic birth for commissions[^18]. She reorganized the army's structure, improved logistics and supply systems, and increased the standing army's size substantially. These reforms, continued by her son Joseph II, created one of Europe's most formidable military establishments, though they proved insufficient to recapture Silesia during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763)[^19].

Her educational reforms were equally significant. Maria Theresa introduced compulsory primary education through the General School Ordinance of 1774, making Austria one of the first European states to mandate basic education for all children between ages six and twelve[^20]. She expanded secondary education, reformed university curricula to include more practical and scientific subjects, and reduced (though did not eliminate) clerical control over education. These reforms aimed to create a literate, skilled population capable of serving the modernizing state and economy[^21].

Economic modernization was pursued through mercantilist policies designed to strengthen Austrian manufactures and reduce dependence on foreign goods. Maria Theresa promoted domestic industry through subsidies, established manufactories for textiles and luxury goods, and improved transportation infrastructure[^22]. She standardized weights, measures, and coinage across her domains, facilitating commerce. Though Austria remained economically behind western European powers, these measures strengthened the fiscal foundation of Habsburg power.

Legal and judicial reform represented another major achievement. Working with advisors including Gerard van Swieten and Count Johann Christoph von Bartenstein, Maria Theresa initiated codification of Austrian law, culminating in the publication of the Constitutio Criminalis Theresiana in 1768, which standardized criminal procedure across her territories[^23]. Though this code retained torture and harsh punishments by modern standards, it represented a significant advance in legal rationalization and consistency. She also worked toward reducing the arbitrary power of local officials and improving access to justice.

Religious reform under Maria Theresa was complex and contradictory. While she remained deeply devout and intolerant toward non-Catholics, she did reduce the political power of the Catholic Church in her domains. She limited the independence of religious orders, subjected church property to taxation, restricted the publication of papal bulls without state approval, and reduced the number of religious holidays—all measures designed to subordinate ecclesiastical institutions to state authority[^24]. This "Josephinism" (though it predated and was more moderate than her son's policies) strengthened state control without embracing religious tolerance.

Her diplomatic achievements included the famous "Diplomatic Revolution" of 1756, in which she reversed centuries of Habsburg-Bourbon enmity to ally Austria with France against Prussia[^25]. Though this alliance failed to recover Silesia during the Seven Years' War, it represented a pragmatic adaptation to changing geopolitical realities and demonstrated Maria Theresa's willingness to abandon outdated policies in pursuit of Habsburg interests. She also secured favorable terms in the First Partition of Poland in 1772, acquiring Galicia and substantially expanding Habsburg territories despite her personal moral qualms about the partition[^26].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her achievements, Maria Theresa's reign was marked by policies and actions that have drawn severe criticism from historians and moral philosophers. Her religious intolerance, particularly toward Jews and Protestants, stands as one of the darkest aspects of her rule. She harbored deep personal antipathy toward Judaism, once stating "I know of no greater plague than this race, which on account of its deceit, usury and avarice is driving my subjects into beggary"[^27]. In 1744-1745, she ordered the expulsion of Jews from Bohemia and Moravia, though she was eventually persuaded by economic advisors to cancel the decree after partial implementation, recognizing the economic damage such expulsion would cause[^28].

Throughout her reign, Maria Theresa maintained discriminatory laws against Jewish communities, including residence restrictions, special taxation, and limits on occupations and marriage. While her son Joseph II would later issue the Edict of Tolerance improving Jewish rights, Maria Theresa actively resisted any liberalization, viewing Jews as inherently harmful to Christian society[^29]. Similarly, she persecuted Protestant communities in her territories, particularly in Hungary and Bohemia, forcing conversions, imprisoning religious leaders, and sending Protestant children to Catholic institutions for re-education[^30].

Her treatment of religious minorities reflected a broader authoritarianism that extended to moral policing of her subjects. Maria Theresa established the "Chastity Commission" (Keuschheitskommission) in 1747 to suppress prostitution, adultery, and other behaviors she deemed immoral[^31]. This body operated with extensive powers of surveillance and punishment, entering private homes, interrogating citizens, and imposing severe penalties for sexual transgressions. While officially dissolved in 1776, it represented an invasive attempt to regulate private behavior according to the empress's rigid moral standards.

Her participation in the partitions of Poland has been widely condemned as cynical realpolitik that destroyed a neighboring state. Though Maria Theresa initially opposed the First Partition of 1772, expressing moral objections to the dismemberment of Poland, she ultimately acquiesced to Austrian participation, famously remarking "She wept, but she took"[^32]. Her moral scruples did not prevent her from seizing Galicia, and Austria participated in subsequent partitions that eventually erased Poland from the map entirely. This episode revealed the gap between her personal piety and the ruthless pursuit of dynastic interest that characterized Habsburg policy[^33].

Critics have also condemned her strategic marriages of her children, particularly her youngest daughter Marie Antoinette to the French dauphin (later Louis XVI). While dynastic marriage was standard practice among European royalty, Maria Theresa's systematic use of her sixteen children as diplomatic pawns has been seen as particularly calculating[^34]. Marie Antoinette's marriage in 1770, arranged when she was only fourteen, sent the young girl to the hostile environment of Versailles poorly prepared for the intrigues she would face, ultimately contributing to her tragic fate during the French Revolution[^35].

Her military campaigns, while defensive in official justification, resulted in enormous loss of life and suffering. The Seven Years' War alone resulted in hundreds of thousands of casualties, and while Frederick II of Prussia bore primary responsibility for initiating conflicts, Maria Theresa's determination to recover Silesia prolonged warfare and devastation across central Europe[^36]. Her alliance with France, while diplomatically innovative, embroiled Austria in colonial conflicts in North America and India that served no Austrian interest and drained resources from European concerns[^37].

Economic critics have noted that despite her mercantilist reforms, Austria remained economically backward compared to Britain, France, and even Prussia. Serfdom persisted throughout her reign with only minimal amelioration, and the peasantry continued to bear crushing burdens of taxation and labor obligations to noble landlords[^38]. While she made some efforts to protect peasants from the worst abuses and recognized that excessive exploitation weakened the state's tax base, fundamental social reform was never seriously attempted, leaving millions in poverty and oppression[^39].

## Personal Life

Maria Theresa's personal life was characterized by a devoted marriage, extraordinary fecundity, and the constant tension between her roles as monarch and mother. Her marriage to Francis Stephen of Lorraine, whom she married for love in 1736, remained strong throughout his life despite his numerous affairs and her awareness of his infidelities[^40]. She was devastated by his sudden death in 1765, wore mourning for the rest of her life, and never fully recovered from the loss. She kept his rooms exactly as he had left them and visited them regularly to pray[^41].

The empress gave birth to sixteen children between 1737 and 1756, an extraordinary number even by eighteenth-century standards. Despite the demands of ruling a vast empire and managing multiple wars, she was an involved mother who took close interest in her children's education, health, and marriages[^42]. She maintained regular correspondence with her daughters after their marriages sent them to foreign courts, though these letters often combined maternal affection with detailed instructions on political matters and expectations that they serve Habsburg interests in their adoptive countries[^43].

Her children included five sons and eleven daughters, though only ten survived to adulthood. The most historically significant were Joseph II, who succeeded her as Holy Roman Emperor and co-ruled with her from 1765; Leopold II, who became Grand Duke of Tuscany and later emperor; and Marie Antoinette, whose marriage to Louis XVI of France and subsequent execution during the French Revolution brought tragedy to Maria Theresa's old age, though she died before witnessing her daughter's fate[^44]. Other daughters became queens of Naples, France, and Portugal, creating a network of Habsburg influence across Europe.

Contemporary accounts describe Maria Theresa as possessing a commanding physical presence despite being only about 5'2" tall. In her youth she was considered beautiful, with blonde hair, fair complexion, and striking blue eyes. However, sixteen pregnancies and middle age substantially changed her appearance; she gained considerable weight and suffered various health problems, including chronic leg ulcers and difficulty walking in her later years[^45]. She remained vain about her appearance and was sensitive to the contrast between her youthful portraits and her aged reality.

Her daily routine reflected her dual roles as monarch and matriarch. She rose early, attended Mass daily, and spent long hours reviewing state papers and meeting with advisors. She insisted on being informed of all important decisions and maintained detailed knowledge of government operations across her domains[^46]. Despite her workload, she made time for her children, often conducting government business while nursing infants or supervising children's lessons. She also enjoyed music, cards, and conversation, maintaining a court that balanced formal Habsburg ceremonial with relative informality in private settings.

Maria Theresa's personality combined apparent contradictions. She was simultaneously authoritarian and consultative, maintaining absolute power while regularly seeking advice from ministers and experts. She was deeply pious yet pragmatic, subordinating church interests to state needs when necessary. She was conservative in social and religious matters yet willing to implement radical administrative reforms[^47]. She could be warm and affectionate with family and favorites while ruthlessly pursuing enemies and enforcing harsh punishments for moral transgressions. These contradictions reflected the complexity of her character and the multiple roles she was forced to balance throughout her life.

Her relationship with her eldest son and eventual co-ruler Joseph II became increasingly strained after Francis's death. Joseph, influenced by Enlightenment ideas, advocated more radical reforms than his mother would accept, particularly regarding religious tolerance and social equality[^48]. Their disagreements over policy created tension, and Maria Theresa increasingly saw her son as dangerously radical and irreligious. She prevented him from implementing many reforms during her lifetime, and their co-rule was marked by continuous conflict over the direction and pace of change[^49].

## Legacy

Maria Theresa's death on November 29, 1780, marked the end of an era in Habsburg and European history. Her forty-year reign had transformed Austria from a fragmented, vulnerable collection of territories into a centralized, efficient state capable of functioning as a great power. The administrative, military, educational, and legal structures she created largely survived her death and provided the foundation for the Habsburg Empire's continued existence until 1918[^50].

Her most enduring legacy was the modernization and rationalization of the Austrian state. The centralized bureaucracy, reformed taxation system, professional military, and educational infrastructure she established outlasted her reign by more than a century. Historians credit her with transforming what had been a medieval-style composite monarchy into a modern state with standardized institutions and unified administration[^51]. This achievement was all the more remarkable given the ethnic and linguistic diversity of her domains, which included Germans, Hungarians, Czechs, Italians, Poles, Romanians, and others.

In Austrian and broader Habsburg memory, Maria Theresa occupies a unique position as the "mother of the nation." She is remembered fondly in Austria and other former Habsburg territories, with numerous streets, squares, monuments, and institutions bearing her name[^52]. Her image appears on Austrian currency and in popular culture as a symbol of Habsburg glory and Austrian identity. This nostalgic remembrance often downplays or ignores the more problematic aspects of her reign, focusing instead on her achievements as a state-builder and her image as devoted wife and mother[^53].

Her impact on European diplomacy and the balance of power was profound. The Diplomatic Revolution she orchestrated fundamentally altered European alliance systems, and her persistent rivalry with Frederick II of Prussia established a German dualism that would persist until 1866[^54]. Her territorial acquisitions, particularly Galicia, expanded Habsburg influence and created new strategic challenges that her successors would struggle to manage. The partition of Poland in which she participated established a dangerous precedent for great power dismemberment of weaker neighbors[^55].

The educational reforms Maria Theresa implemented had lasting cultural impact. Compulsory primary education, while imperfectly implemented, marked a significant step toward universal literacy and created expectations of state responsibility for education that expanded in subsequent centuries[^56]. The Theresian school system, reformed and expanded by later rulers, helped create a literate bureaucracy and middle class that would drive nineteenth-century Austrian cultural and economic development.

Her complex religious legacy includes both repression and the seeds of eventual tolerance. While she herself remained deeply intolerant, her subordination of church to state created structures that her son Joseph II used to implement religious toleration. The limitations she placed on clerical privilege and church autonomy weakened institutional obstacles to later reform, even though this was not her intention[^57]. Paradoxically, her devout Catholicism and anti-Protestant policies strengthened the state's capacity to eventually enforce tolerance over church objections.

Maria Theresa's approach to motherhood and dynastic marriage created a network of Habsburg influence across Europe but also contributed to future instability. Her daughters, placed on thrones from France to Naples, advanced Habsburg interests but also became vulnerable when revolution and war shook Europe. Marie Antoinette's fate demonstrated the potential tragedy of this system, though Maria Theresa herself died before witnessing the French Revolution[^58].

Her reign's significance for women's political history remains contested. Some historians celebrate her as proof that women could successfully wield absolute power and govern as effectively as men, noting that her gender did not prevent her from implementing comprehensive reforms and defending her inheritance against powerful male rivals[^59]. Others argue that Maria Theresa's reign was exceptional rather than transformative, that she did nothing to advance women's rights or opportunities more broadly, and that she even reinforced patriarchal structures through her moral policing and conventional views on gender roles[^60].

The contrast between Maria Theresa and her son Joseph II has shaped historical assessment of both rulers. Where she was pragmatic and cautious, he was idealistic and radical. Where she was devoutly Catholic and socially conservative, he was influenced by Enlightenment rationalism and pursued egalitarian reforms. Where she implemented changes gradually and strategically, he attempted sweeping transformations that often failed[^61]. Historians debate whether her cautious reformism or his radical approach better served Austrian interests, but most acknowledge that her careful state-building made his later reforms possible, even as her social conservatism limited their scope during her lifetime[^62].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Maria Theresa emphasize her remarkable achievements in extraordinarily difficult circumstances. William J. McGill, in his study of the empress, argues that she "ranks among the most successful European rulers of the eighteenth century" and that her state-building accomplishments compare favorably with those of Frederick II of Prussia and other enlightened absolutists[^63]. Supporters note that she inherited a nearly bankrupt, militarily weak, administratively chaotic state under immediate existential threat and transformed it into a coherent, powerful monarchy capable of lasting another 138 years after her death.

Historians sympathetic to Maria Theresa highlight her pragmatism and political wisdom. Unlike ideologically-driven reformers, she approached problems practically, willing to adopt new methods when old ones failed but careful not to disrupt social stability unnecessarily. C.A. Macartney praises her for understanding the limits of the possible and working within existing constraints rather than attempting utopian transformations that might provoke resistance and chaos[^64]. Her caution, in this view, reflected wisdom rather than timidity and contributed to the success and durability of her reforms.

Feminist historians have identified Maria Theresa as an important figure in women's political history, demonstrating that women could exercise power effectively in male-dominated environments. Barbara Stollberg-Rilinger emphasizes how Maria Theresa navigated the contradiction between Salic Law traditions that excluded women from rule and the dynastic principle that required her succession, using her femininity strategically when advantageous while exercising thoroughly masculine political and military authority when necessary[^65]. Her successful reign challenged contemporary assumptions about women's incapacity for governance and provided an important precedent.

Defenders of her religious policies note that her intolerance was typical of the eighteenth century and actually less severe than many contemporaries. While she persecuted Jews and Protestants, she did not conduct pogroms or mass killings, and her policies were driven by genuine religious conviction rather than mere political opportunism[^66]. Compared to the religious violence of earlier centuries or the persecution occurring in other European states, her actions, while reprehensible by modern standards, were relatively moderate for her time and context.

Admirers emphasize her personal qualities: devotion to duty, tireless work ethic, loving motherhood, faithful (if not reciprocated) marriage, and personal integrity. Unlike many absolute monarchs, she lived relatively simply, avoided excessive luxury, and devoted her energies to governance rather than personal pleasure[^67]. Her genuine piety, while it led to intolerance, was authentic rather than hypocritical, and her moral standards, however rigid, were applied to herself as well as others. These personal virtues made her popular with many of her subjects and created an image of the caring, maternal monarch[^68].

Military historians acknowledge that while she never defeated Frederick II decisively, her military reforms significantly improved Austrian capabilities and that she successfully defended the bulk of her inheritance against overwhelming odds. The survival and strengthening of Habsburg power during her reign, in this view, represents a substantial military achievement, particularly given the disadvantageous strategic position she inherited[^69]. Her willingness to appoint competent commanders based on ability rather than birth and her personal involvement in military planning demonstrated effective leadership.

Economic historians note that her mercantilist policies, while not transforming Austria into a commercial power comparable to Britain or France, did strengthen domestic manufacturing, improve fiscal administration, and increase state revenues substantially. Elisabeth Kovács argues that Maria Theresa's economic reforms laid foundations for later industrialization and that her limitations reflected Austria's geographic and demographic constraints rather than policy failures[^70]. The improvement in state finances was particularly significant given the nearly bankrupt condition she inherited.

### Negative Views

Critics of Maria Theresa condemn her religious intolerance as inexcusable regardless of historical context. Paul P. Bernard argues that her anti-Semitism and anti-Protestantism reflected not merely her era's prejudices but her personal animus, noting that even contemporaries found some of her anti-Jewish measures excessive and economically counterproductive[^71]. Her attempted expulsion of Jews from Bohemia, persecution of Protestants, and resistance to any liberalization of religious policy created lasting harm and suffering that cannot be excused by appeals to eighteenth-century norms, particularly when other contemporary rulers were moving toward tolerance.

Historians critical of her reign emphasize the gap between Enlightenment ideals circulating in eighteenth-century Europe and Maria Theresa's fundamentally conservative, even reactionary, approach to social issues. While Frederick II, Catherine II of Russia, and even some smaller German princes engaged with Enlightenment philosophy and implemented reforms influenced by these ideas, Maria Theresa remained hostile to Enlightenment thought, viewing it as dangerous to religious faith and social order[^72]. Her reign thus represented a missed opportunity for Austria to embrace progressive reforms that might have created a more just and dynamic society.

T.C.W. Blanning and others criticize her military policies as costly failures that drained Austrian resources without achieving strategic objectives. The Seven Years' War, fought largely to recover Silesia, ended in expensive failure, confirming Prussian possession of the province and establishing Prussia as a permanent rival great power[^73]. Her determination to reverse the loss of Silesia, driven by dynastic pride rather than rational calculation of costs and benefits, led to decades of destructive warfare that weakened Austria relative to other European powers. The resources devoted to ultimately unsuccessful wars against Prussia might have been better used for domestic development.

Feminist critics argue that Maria Theresa's reign did little to advance women's status and actually reinforced patriarchal structures. Despite ruling in her own right, she never challenged male primogeniture, never advocated for women's education or opportunities, and governed according to thoroughly patriarchal principles[^74]. Her moral policing particularly targeted women's sexual behavior, and her views on women's proper roles remained entirely conventional. She viewed her own rule as an exceptional circumstance necessitated by dynastic accident rather than as validating women's political capacity generally.

Critics of her social policies emphasize that serfdom remained essentially untouched during her reign. While she made some minor ameliorations to protect peasants from the worst landlord abuses, fundamental reform of the feudal system was never seriously attempted[^75]. The vast majority of her subjects remained in legal bondage, subject to labor obligations, restrictions on movement, and seigneurial justice. Her failure to address this fundamental injustice, critics argue, reflected her class interests and unwillingness to challenge noble privilege despite her willingness to reduce noble political autonomy.

The partitions of Poland remain a major stain on her reputation. While she expressed moral qualms, her participation in destroying a neighboring state demonstrated the hollowness of her religious piety and revealed the cynical realpolitik that governed Habsburg policy[^76]. Her famous tears, real or performed, did not prevent her from seizing Polish territory or participating in subsequent partitions. This episode, critics argue, exemplified the moral bankruptcy of dynastic absolutism and demonstrated that Maria Theresa's religious convictions did not extend to respecting the rights of weaker neighbors when territorial aggrandizement was possible.

Scholars critical of the Habsburg myth-making that surrounds Maria Theresa argue that her positive reputation reflects nationalist nostalgia rather than objective assessment. Pieter M. Judson notes that nineteenth- and twentieth-century Austrian and Hungarian nationalism created romanticized images of Maria Theresa as a benevolent mother-empress that served contemporary political purposes but distorted historical reality[^77]. The "Good Empress Maria Theresa" of popular memory bears little resemblance to the complex, often harsh ruler documented in historical records. This hagiographic tradition, critics argue, obscures serious examination of her reign's failures and injustices.

Economic historians critical of her policies note that despite mercantilist reforms, Austria fell further behind western European economies during her reign. The failure to develop significant overseas trade, limited industrial development, persistence of guild restrictions, and maintenance of serfdom all hindered economic dynamization[^78]. While the empress increased state revenues through better tax collection, she did not fundamentally transform the Austrian economy's structure or create conditions for sustained growth comparable to that occurring in Britain, France, or even some smaller European states. Her economic legacy, in this view, was one of missed opportunities and continued backwardness.
