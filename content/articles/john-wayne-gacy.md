## Summary
John Wayne Gacy, known as the "Killer Clown," was an American serial killer and rapist who sexually assaulted, tortured, and murdered at least 33 teenage boys and young men between 1972 and 1978 in Cook County, Illinois. He buried most of his victims in the crawl space beneath his house. Gacy was a seemingly respectable community figure who performed as "Pogo the Clown" at charitable events.

## Early Life
John Wayne Gacy was born on March 17, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to John Stanley Gacy and Marion Elaine Robinson. He had a difficult relationship with his alcoholic father, who was physically and emotionally abusive. Despite health issues including a congenital heart condition, Gacy was active in community organizations. He worked as a manager at several KFC restaurants in Iowa before moving back to Chicago, where he ran a successful construction business. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1972 and 1978, Gacy lured at least 33 young men and teenage boys to his home in Norwood Park Township near Chicago. He would typically offer them employment in his construction business or use other ruses. He tortured and sexually assaulted his victims before killing them by asphyxiation. He buried 26 of his victims in the crawl space under his home and disposed of others in the Des Plaines River. Throughout this period, he maintained a façade as a respected businessman and community volunteer. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Gacy came under suspicion following the disappearance of 15-year-old Robert Piest on December 11, 1978. Police surveillance and a search warrant led to the discovery of human remains in the crawl space of Gacy's home. He confessed to the murders and was arrested on December 21, 1978. In 1980, he was convicted of 33 murders and sentenced to death. He was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center on May 10, 1994. [^3]
