## Summary

Santiago Ramón y Cajal was a Spanish neuroscientist who shared the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work on the structure of the nervous system. He is considered the father of modern neuroscience for establishing the neuron doctrine — that the nervous system is made up of individual cells (neurons) rather than a continuous network. His detailed drawings of neural structures remain influential. Cajal also wrote extensively on the philosophy of science.
