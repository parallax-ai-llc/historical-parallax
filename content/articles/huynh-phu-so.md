## Summary

[Huỳnh Phú Sổ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Huynh-Phu-So) (1920-1947) was a Vietnamese Buddhist reformer and nationalist leader who founded [Hòa Hảo Buddhism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hoa-Hao-Vietnamese-religious-movement) in 1939, a simplified form of Buddhism designed to appeal to poor peasants in the Mekong Delta.[^1][^2] Known as the "Mad Bonze" by French colonial authorities and revered as the "Living Buddha" by his followers, he rapidly attracted over 100,000 adherents within his first year of preaching.[^3][^4] His accurate predictions of World War II events, coupled with his charismatic healing abilities and anti-colonial stance, made him both a religious prophet and political icon.[^5] He was assassinated by the Viet Minh in April 1947 during negotiations, transforming him into a martyr whose [religious movement continues](https://www.thevietnamese.org/2021/08/the-tumultuous-and-tragic-history-of-hoa-hao-buddhism/) to influence millions in Vietnam today.[^6][^7]

## Early Life and Background

Huỳnh Phú Sổ was born on January 15, 1920, in [Hòa Hảo Village](https://www.vietvisiontravel.com/post/the-birth-of-hoa-hao-buddhism/), Tan Chau District, Chau Doc Province (present-day Phu My Commune, Phu Tan District, An Giang Province) in the Mekong Delta region of southern Vietnam, near the Cambodian border.[^8][^9] He was the eldest son of Huỳnh Công Bộ, a moderately wealthy peasant who served as village chief (Hương Cả), and Lê Thị Nhâm, members of a well-to-do family known throughout the region for their honesty and altruistic behavior.[^10][^11]

From childhood, Sổ suffered from severe and persistent health problems that profoundly shaped his early years.[^12] Plagued by chronic insomnia, fever, and general physical weakness, his fragile constitution forced him to abandon formal education at the age of fifteen.[^13] During this extended period of illness lasting until age 20, his family retained numerous local healers who attempted various traditional treatments.[^14] Rather than becoming debilitated by his condition, young Sổ used this time productively, immersing himself in the study of Vietnamese herbal medicine, methods of incantation, and spiritual texts.[^15]

His education during this period was unconventional but thorough. He spent considerable time studying the oracles of [Trạng Trình](https://tuoitrephatgiaohoahao.com/a129/1-biographical-sketch-of-prophet-huynh-phu-so) (Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm), a 16th-century Vietnamese prophet-poet, and delved deeply into the thought of Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương, an earlier Buddhist reform movement founded in 1849.[^16] Sổ was also educated by Buddhist monks who taught him traditional Buddhist philosophy and practices.[^17] This combination of illness-induced isolation, intensive self-study, and mentorship by religious figures created the intellectual and spiritual foundation for his later revolutionary religious ideas.[^18]

The socio-economic context of his upbringing was crucial to his development. Growing up in the Mekong Delta during the 1920s and 1930s, Sổ witnessed firsthand the exploitation and suffering of Vietnamese peasants under French colonial rule.[^19] His family's relatively comfortable position gave him perspective on both the traditional village power structure and the grievances of the impoverished masses who would later become his most devoted followers.[^20] The cultural milieu of Chau Doc Province, with its syncretic blend of Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and indigenous Vietnamese beliefs, provided fertile ground for religious innovation.[^21]

## Rise to Power

The transformation of Huỳnh Phú Sổ from chronically ill youth to charismatic prophet occurred dramatically in [May 1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huynh_Phu_So), during a stormy night when, at age 19-20, he was apparently miraculously cured of his long-standing illnesses.[^22] According to Hòa Hảo tradition, this cure occurred during a pilgrimage visit to the sacred mountains of That Son (Thất Sơn) and Ta Lon (Tà Lơn), where he experienced religious enlightenment.[^23][^24] On the 18th day of the 5th month of the year of the Hare (1939), Sổ began his evangelical mission, marking the official founding of [Hòa Hảo Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hòa_Hảo).[^25][^26]

His rise to prominence was meteoric and unprecedented in modern Vietnamese religious history. Sổ's simplified Buddhist teachings, designed specifically to appeal to poor peasants, resonated powerfully with the rural masses of the Mekong Delta.[^27] He traveled extensively throughout southern Vietnam practicing herbal healing and acupuncture, offering free medical consultations using simple herbs and traditional treatments.[^28] His speaking style exerted an almost hypnotic influence over audiences, earning him the nickname "Đạo Khùng" or "Mad Monk."[^29]

What truly catapulted Sổ to national prominence, however, were his remarkably accurate prophecies. He predicted with stunning precision the outbreak of World War II, the fall of France to Nazi Germany in 1940, the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, and even the future intervention of the United States.[^30][^31] These predictions, made before the events occurred, convinced many Vietnamese that Sổ possessed supernatural powers.[^32] His success as a prophet led his followers to call him the "Phật Sống" or "Living Buddha."[^33]

Within less than a year of beginning his mission, Sổ had attracted over 100,000 followers, an extraordinary achievement that alarmed French colonial authorities.[^34][^35] In a time of colonial occupation, a native religious movement with nationalist overtones appealed powerfully to the masses who were displaying increasingly strong nationalist sentiment.[^36] His inflammatory speeches, which contained veiled and sometimes explicit anti-French messages, brought him directly to the attention of colonial administrators.[^37]

The French response was swift and repressive. Exiled from one Vietnamese province after another as authorities attempted to contain his influence, Sổ continued to draw disciples wherever he went.[^38] In August 1940, Vichy French governor Jean Decoux took decisive action, detaining Sổ in the [psychiatric hospital at Chợ Quán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huynh_Phu_So) near Saigon under the pretext that he was mentally unstable—hence the French colonial authorities' derisive label of the "mad bonze."[^39][^40]

The psychiatric detention backfired spectacularly. Rather than discrediting Sổ, it enhanced his reputation. The psychiatrist assigned to treat him, after extensive interaction, not only declared Sổ sane in 1941 but became a convert to his religious teachings.[^41][^42] This remarkable conversion of his captor to his follower became legendary and further cemented Sổ's reputation as possessing extraordinary spiritual power.[^43]

Unable to contain him through psychiatry, the French attempted to exile Sổ to Laos in 1942.[^44] However, Japanese agents, with assistance from Hòa Hảo followers, intercepted the transfer and brought Sổ back to Saigon, where he was held under "protection" by the Kempeitai (Japanese military police).[^45][^46] The Japanese authorities rebuffed French protests and demands for extradition by claiming he was held as a suspected "Chinese spy."[^47]

## Major Achievements

Huỳnh Phú Sổ's most enduring achievement was the creation and rapid dissemination of [Hòa Hảo Buddhism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hoa-Hao-Vietnamese-religious-movement), a reformed Buddhist movement that revolutionized religious practice in southern Vietnam.[^48] His genius lay in simplifying complex Buddhist doctrine and ritual into a form accessible to illiterate peasants while maintaining spiritual authenticity.[^49] He advocated a return to Theravāda ("Way of the Elders") Buddhism from the Mahāyāna ("Greater Vehicle") form prevalent in Vietnam, stressing austerity, Spartan living, simple worship, and personal salvation.[^50][^51]

The core philosophy of Hòa Hảo, as articulated by Sổ, represented a radical democratization of religious practice. He taught that "it is better to pray with a pure heart before the family altar than to perform gaudy ceremonies in a pagoda, clad in the robes of an unworthy bonze."[^52] Similarly, he emphasized that "the cult must stem much more from internal faith than from a pompous appearance."[^53] These teachings directly challenged the power and wealth of the established Buddhist hierarchy while empowering ordinary believers.[^54]

Master Huỳnh Phú Sổ absorbed teachings and canon law from previous religions such as Buddhism and Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương, but his distinctive gift was to "simplify" these traditions to make them concise, easy to understand, and easy to practice.[^55] Unlike orthodox Buddhism, [Hòa Hảo eschewed elaborate rituals and temples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hòa_Hảo), maintained no monastic order, and taught home practice.[^56][^57] Sổ advocated that each devotee could have direct communion with the Buddha, and that inner faith was more important than external rites.[^58]

The theological framework he created was syncretic and culturally resonant, representing [an amalgam of Buddhism, ancestor worship, animistic rites, elements of Confucian doctrine](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hoa-Hao-Vietnamese-religious-movement), and indigenous Vietnamese practices transformed and adapted to the mores and customs of Mekong Delta peasants.[^59][^60] The central teaching became "Study Buddhism to improve yourselves," meaning that followers must observe the genuine teachings of Buddha to make themselves better in order to fulfill their duty in present life and to reach the Buddhist Paradise.[^61]

A cornerstone of Sổ's teaching was the "Four Debts of Gratitude" (Tứ Ân), which included: gratitude to parents and ancestors, gratitude to country, gratitude to Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, and gratitude to fellow countrymen.[^62] This framework brilliantly integrated religious devotion with nationalist sentiment and social responsibility.[^63]

He understood pragmatically that [peasants had little time or money](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Huynh-Phu-So) to attend and support elaborate religious services, thus he advocated simple religious practices to be carried out within the home rather than in temples.[^64][^65] Hòa Hảo Buddhism has no clergy or statues and few temples, making it accessible to the poorest members of society.[^66] This accessibility earned it the descriptor "poor man's Buddhism" because of its outward simplicity.[^67]

His teachings focused on providing assistance to the poor rather than partaking in expensive rituals.[^68] During its inception, the religion's appeal was primarily to the poor peasantry of the Mekong Delta, offering them the possibility of a good life and showing them how to practice Buddhism even in conditions of deprivation.[^69][^70] Hòa Hảo Buddhism does not focus exclusively on Buddhist sutras, but mainly on the teachings of the founder whose words have been mostly transmitted in the form of easily understood poems.[^71]

Beyond religious innovation, Sổ achieved significant political and military organization. In 1944, [Hòa Hảo Buddhism established a paramilitary force](https://www.thevietnamese.org/2021/08/the-tumultuous-and-tragic-history-of-hoa-hao-buddhism/) called the Bảo An (Peace Protection) Group to maintain security of Hòa Hảo Buddhist villages in the Mekong Delta.[^72][^73] The Hòa Hảo was one of the first groups to initiate armed hostilities against French and later Japanese colonialists.[^74] As the Japanese were defeated and Vietnam fell into a power vacuum in 1945, Sổ ordered the creation of armed units for campaigns against the local administration, landowners, and French colonial forces.[^75]

In June 1946, demonstrating his political sophistication, [Huỳnh Phú Sổ created a separate political party](https://indochine.uqam.ca/en/historical-dictionary/652-hunh-phu-s-19201947.html) called the Vietnamese National-Socialist Party (Đảng Việt Nam Dân Chủ Xã Hội, or Đảng Dân Xã for short) and appointed himself leader.[^76] This institutional separation of religious and political functions showed organizational sophistication beyond pure charismatic authority.[^77]

The movement's rapid growth during the Japanese occupation in World War II demonstrated Sổ's ability to navigate complex political waters.[^78] He avoided accusations of being a Japanese collaborator by predicting their demise, yet his contacts with them allowed his supporters to gain weapons.[^79] This political dexterity—maintaining nationalist credentials while pragmatically accepting support from occupying powers—required considerable skill.[^80]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Huỳnh Phú Sổ's relationship with Japanese occupation forces remains one of the most controversial aspects of his career. In 1942, he was [kidnapped by Japanese agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huynh_Phu_So) and held in Saigon, where the Kempeitai kept him under "protection."[^81][^82] While Sổ's defenders argue he was essentially a prisoner and that he cleverly avoided being labeled a collaborator by predicting Japan's defeat, critics point to the undeniable fact that his contacts with Japanese authorities allowed his supporters to gain weapons and organizational capacity.[^83][^84]

The Hòa Hảo grew rapidly during the Japanese occupation, and the movement benefited materially from this period.[^85] Some historians have questioned whether Sổ's anti-colonial stance was principled or opportunistic, noting that he opposed French rule while accepting Japanese protection.[^86] The ambiguity of this relationship—neither full collaboration nor complete resistance—places Sổ in the morally complex gray zone occupied by many nationalist leaders during the occupation period.[^87]

His relationship with various Vietnamese political factions was equally contentious and marked by shifting alliances. The Viet Minh were deeply worried by Sổ's nationalist credentials and social structure, and attempted to co-opt him into a National Unified Front.[^88] This front dissolved in July 1946 after it became apparent that Sổ would not follow Viet Minh direction, setting the stage for violent conflict.[^89] Sổ's fierce anti-communism and refusal to subordinate his religious movement to communist political control made him a marked man.[^90]

The creation of armed Hòa Hảo units and the Vietnamese National-Socialist Party in 1945-1946 transformed what began as a religious movement into a political-military force, a development that drew criticism from multiple directions.[^91] After the war, disagreement first with the French and then with the communist Viet Minh made the Hòa Hảo sect what one scholar characterized as "an aggressive religio-political-military cult."[^92] This militarization arguably betrayed the pacifist elements of Buddhist philosophy and contributed to the cycle of violence that engulfed southern Vietnam.[^93]

From approximately 1947 to 1955, [Hòa Hảo Buddhism became a competent military force with French help](https://www.thevietnamese.org/2021/08/the-tumultuous-and-tragic-history-of-hoa-hao-buddhism/), receiving arms for some 20,000 Hòa Hảo fighters in exchange for their assistance against the Viet Minh forces.[^94][^95] This collaboration with French colonial forces—the very power against which Sổ had initially positioned himself—represented a significant ideological compromise that damaged the movement's anti-colonial credentials.[^96]

Critics of Sổ's religious innovations argued that his simplified Buddhism was theologically shallow, lacking the philosophical depth and meditative practices of traditional Buddhism.[^97] Established Buddhist clergy viewed him as a dangerous charlatan who was undermining proper religious practice and siphoning away followers and donations.[^98] The French colonial epithet "mad bonze" reflected not just political opposition but genuine religious establishment hostility to his reformist ideas.[^99]

His cult of personality—being called the "Living Buddha" by followers—raised concerns about megalomania and the potential for authoritarian control within the movement.[^100] The prediction of his return "in a time of crisis," similar to messianic expectations in other traditions, created conditions for potential manipulation and false prophets claiming his mantle.[^101]

The violence that erupted after his death also reflects poorly on the legacy he left. Following his assassination, the Hòa Hảo massacred thousands of Viet Minh in retaliation, perpetuating the cycle of sectarian violence.[^102] The various Hòa Hảo commanders began infighting without centralized leadership, demonstrating that Sổ had built a movement dependent on charismatic authority rather than institutional structures capable of surviving his death.[^103]

## Personal Life

Remarkably little is documented about [Huỳnh Phú Sổ's personal life](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Huynh-Phu-So), particularly regarding marriage, romantic relationships, or children.[^104] Historical sources focus almost exclusively on his religious activities and political role, leaving significant gaps in understanding him as a private individual.[^105] This absence of personal detail may reflect both the brevity of his public career (1939-1947, merely eight years) and the traditional Vietnamese reticence about discussing personal matters of religious figures.[^106]

What is known about his character comes primarily from accounts of his public persona and interactions with followers. Contemporaries described him as possessing an almost hypnotic speaking ability, with a charismatic presence that could entrance large audiences.[^107] His success as a healer and his compassionate treatment of the poor suggest a personality genuinely moved by the suffering of ordinary people.[^108] The fact that he offered free medical consultations and used simple, accessible herbs indicates someone committed to practical service rather than merely seeking power or wealth.[^109]

His chronic illness during youth undoubtedly shaped his personality and worldview. The experience of years of physical suffering, social isolation, and proximity to death likely contributed to the spiritual intensity and urgency that characterized his later teaching.[^110] His deep study during this period suggests an intellectual temperament and capacity for sustained concentration despite physical discomfort.[^111]

Sổ's courage in repeatedly confronting French colonial authority—despite multiple arrests, psychiatric detention, and exile—demonstrates considerable personal bravery.[^112] His willingness to continue preaching despite official persecution reveals either profound conviction in his religious mission or significant personal ambition, likely both.[^113]

His personality must have combined genuine religious fervor with political sophistication. The ability to navigate relationships with Japanese occupiers, French colonials, Viet Minh communists, and various nationalist factions while maintaining an independent power base required not just spiritual charisma but considerable diplomatic skill and strategic thinking.[^114]

Contemporaries' accounts suggest he maintained a simple lifestyle consistent with the austere Buddhism he preached, though detailed verification of his personal habits and daily routine is lacking in historical records.[^115] The poems through which he transmitted many of his teachings suggest an artistic sensibility and appreciation for accessible forms of expression.[^116]

His prediction that "politics would be the cause of his premature death" reveals self-awareness about the dangerous path he had chosen.[^117] This prophetic acceptance of his likely fate suggests either fatalism, martyrdom complex, or simply realistic assessment of the violent political environment in which he operated.[^118]

## Legacy

[Huỳnh Phú Sổ's assassination](https://indochine.uqam.ca/en/historical-dictionary/652-hunh-phu-s-19201947.html) on April 16, 1947, transformed him from controversial living leader into martyred prophet, a status that enhanced rather than diminished his influence.[^119] Many Hòa Hảo faithful refused to believe he died, predicting his return in a time of crisis, a messianic expectation that has persisted for decades.[^120][^121] This belief in his eventual return has kept his memory and teachings vibrantly alive within the community.[^122]

The religious movement he founded has demonstrated remarkable resilience despite decades of political persecution and social change. [Hòa Hảo Buddhism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hoa-Hao-Vietnamese-religious-movement) is today one of the major religions of Vietnam, with between one million and eight million adherents, mostly concentrated in the Mekong Delta.[^123][^124] Official government statistics from December 2021 recorded 1.5 million followers of the state-recognized Hòa Hảo Buddhist Church, an increase from just under 1 million in the 2019 census.[^125] However, Hòa Hảo Buddhist managers have stated there are actually 8 million followers, suggesting the true numbers far exceed official figures.[^126]

The geographical concentration of followers in [An Giang, Đồng Tháp, Kiên Giang, Vĩnh Long and Phong Định Provinces](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/vietnam-country-policy-and-information-notes/country-policy-and-information-note-hoa-hao-buddhism-vietnam-january-2024-accessible) demonstrates the movement's continuing strength in its Mekong Delta heartland.[^127] This regional base has allowed Hòa Hảo Buddhism to maintain distinct identity and resist complete assimilation into state-controlled religious structures.[^128]

The political legacy of Sổ and the Hòa Hảo movement remained significant long after his death. Though many Hòa Hảo adherents joined the communist-backed National Liberation Front in the late 1960s, the Hòa Hảo remained a powerful independent force in South Vietnamese politics until the communist victory in 1975.[^129] After 1954, the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài began armed opposition to the U.S.-backed government of President Ngô Đình Diệm, who brutally repressed the movement.[^130][^131]

[Before 1999, the Vietnamese state strictly forbid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hòa_Hảo) any worship practices in public by Hòa Hảo followers.[^132] That year marked a turning point when Hòa Hảo was officially recognized as a religion, and since then it has operated based on the principles of the Central Executive Committee of Hòa Hảo Buddhism.[^133] This official recognition, while bringing some legitimacy, also brought state oversight and control that some followers view as compromising the movement's independence.[^134]

Sổ's theological innovation—the radical simplification and democratization of Buddhist practice—has influenced Vietnamese Buddhism more broadly.[^135] His emphasis on internal faith over external ritual, home worship over temple ceremonies, and direct communion with the divine without clerical intermediaries represented ideas that resonated beyond the Hòa Hảo community.[^136] The concept of "poor man's Buddhism" demonstrated that religious profundity need not be expensive or complex, a lesson with continuing relevance.[^137]

His synthesis of Buddhism with Vietnamese nationalism and social justice concerns created a model of engaged Buddhism that anticipated later developments in Buddhist social activism.[^138] The "Four Debts of Gratitude" framework, which integrated religious devotion with patriotic duty and social responsibility, offered a compelling alternative to both traditional Buddhism and communist ideology.[^139]

The image of Sổ as a prophet who accurately predicted historical events has contributed to a Vietnamese tradition of oracle interpretation and prophecy that continues today.[^140] His predictions about World War II, while historically verifiable, have been retrospectively embellished and expanded in popular memory, creating a legendary figure larger than the historical person.[^141]

His legacy includes the painful heritage of religious-political violence. The militarization of the Hòa Hảo movement, the massacres and counter-massacres involving Hòa Hảo forces, and the factional conflicts after his death represent the dark side of mixing religious authority with military power.[^142] This aspect of his legacy serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of charismatic religious-political movements in conflict zones.[^143]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and admirers of [Huỳnh Phú Sổ](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Huynh-Phu-So) emphasize his role as a genuine religious reformer who democratized Buddhist practice and made spiritual life accessible to Vietnam's poorest citizens.[^144] Religious studies scholars note that his simplification of Buddhism was not mere dilution but a sophisticated adaptation that preserved core Buddhist values while eliminating barriers to practice for illiterate peasants.[^145] His emphasis on internal faith, ethical conduct, and social responsibility over ritual correctness represented authentic Buddhist reform in the tradition of earlier Buddhist renewal movements throughout Asian history.[^146]

Nationalist historians in Vietnam view Sổ as an anti-colonial hero who mobilized rural masses against French imperialism at a time when most Vietnamese elites were either collaborating with or accommodating colonial rule.[^147] His rapid success in building a mass following demonstrated the potential for indigenous religious movements to serve as vehicles for nationalist resistance.[^148] The fact that he alarmed French authorities sufficiently to warrant psychiatric detention and exile indicates the genuine threat his movement posed to colonial stability.[^149]

Some scholars argue that Sổ's political pragmatism—his complex relationships with Japanese, French, and various Vietnamese factions—reflected sophisticated strategic thinking rather than opportunistic collaboration.[^150] In the chaotic context of 1940s Indochina, maintaining independence and protecting his followers required tactical flexibility and the ability to play various powers against each other.[^151] His refusal to subordinate the Hòa Hảo movement to either French colonial authority or Viet Minh communist control demonstrated principled commitment to religious autonomy.[^152]

Defenders emphasize his genuine compassion for the poor, evidenced by his free medical services, simplified religious teachings accessible to all, and focus on social welfare.[^153] The "Four Debts of Gratitude" framework is viewed as a brilliant ethical system that integrated personal spirituality with family responsibility, patriotic duty, and social solidarity.[^154] His teachings on assisting the poor and emphasizing internal character over external ritual represented progressive social values wrapped in traditional religious language.[^155]

His prophetic abilities, while impossible to verify scientifically, did include documented predictions that came true, particularly regarding World War II events.[^156] Whether this reflected genuine prescience, intelligent analysis of geopolitical trends, or retrospective mythologizing by followers, his reputation as a prophet served to mobilize believers and create powerful group solidarity.[^157]

The remarkable resilience and continued growth of Hòa Hảo Buddhism, despite decades of persecution by French, South Vietnamese, and Communist governments, testifies to the power and authenticity of Sổ's religious vision.[^158] Movements built purely on charismatic deception typically do not survive the founder's death by nearly eight decades and continue attracting millions of adherents.[^159]

### Negative Views

Critics and skeptical historians question whether [Huỳnh Phú Sổ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huynh_Phu_So) was a genuine religious prophet or a clever charlatan who exploited rural superstition and colonial-era chaos for personal power.[^160] His "miraculous cure" in 1939, his medical treatments using herbs and acupuncture, and his "prophetic" abilities can all be explained through natural means—spontaneous remission, effective traditional medicine, and shrewd political analysis respectively.[^161] Skeptics note that claims of supernatural powers are common among religious founders and should be viewed with considerable doubt.[^162]

His relationship with Japanese occupation forces remains deeply problematic for critics who view him as an opportunistic collaborator whose anti-French rhetoric was convenient political positioning rather than principled anti-colonialism.[^163] The fact that Japanese protection allowed the Hòa Hảo to arm and organize militarily suggests a mutually beneficial arrangement that served Japanese interests in destabilizing French colonial authority.[^164] Critics argue that truly principled anti-colonialism would have rejected all foreign occupiers, not just accepted Japanese "protection" while condemning French rule.[^165]

The militarization of the Hòa Hảo movement under Sổ's leadership contradicts fundamental Buddhist principles of non-violence.[^166] Creating armed units, ordering campaigns against local administrators and landowners, and presiding over what became "an aggressive religio-political-military cult" represents a profound betrayal of Buddhist ethical teachings.[^167] The subsequent violence, including massacres of Viet Minh after Sổ's death, flowed directly from his decision to militarize the movement.[^168]

His later collaboration with French colonial forces—accepting arms for 20,000 Hòa Hảo fighters to fight against the Viet Minh—completely undermined his anti-colonial credentials and revealed the movement's political opportunism.[^169] By 1947-1955, the Hòa Hảo had become French auxiliaries fighting against Vietnamese nationalist-communists, making Sổ's earlier anti-French rhetoric appear hypocritical.[^170]

Theologically, critics argue that Sổ's simplified Buddhism was intellectually shallow, lacking the philosophical sophistication, meditative practices, and ethical rigor of authentic Buddhist traditions.[^171] His emphasis on simple home worship and accessible practices, while democratizing, also eliminated the contemplative depth and transformative practices that constitute Buddhism's core.[^172] The result was a folk religion that borrowed Buddhist terminology while abandoning Buddhist substance.[^173]

The cult of personality surrounding Sổ—the title "Living Buddha," the messianic expectations, the predictions of his return—suggests a megalomaniacal leader who encouraged quasi-divine worship rather than pointing followers toward enlightenment.[^174] This personality cult created authoritarian power structures and prevented the development of institutional mechanisms capable of functioning after his death, as evidenced by the factional conflicts that immediately followed his assassination.[^175]

Communist historians have consistently portrayed Sổ as a reactionary obstacle to progressive revolution, a feudal-religious leader whose movement served landlord and colonial interests against peasant liberation.[^176] While this assessment reflects communist ideological bias, it highlights real questions about whose interests the Hòa Hảo movement ultimately served.[^177]
