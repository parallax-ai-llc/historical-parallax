## Summary

**Unit 731** was a covert biological and chemical warfare research unit of the Imperial Japanese Army. Masquerading as the "Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department," it conducted some of the most gruesome lethal human experiments in history. From 1935 to 1945, thousands of men, women, and children—mostly Chinese civilians and Russian/Allied POWs—were subjected to vivisection, pathogen injection, and weapons testing. The atrocities were covered up after the war when the United States granted immunity to the unit's researchers in exchange for their exclusive biological warfare data.

## "Maruta": The Dehumanization
The facility in Pingfang was an immense complex, complete with an airfield and a prison. The subjects were referred to by staff as **"Maruta"** (logs/lumber). This terminology allowed the doctors to psychologically distance themselves from the torture; they weren't cutting open humans, but processing "logs."
*   **Subjects:** Chinese civilians arrested for "suspicious activities," Russian families, Koreans, and Allied POWs.
*   **No Survivors:** It was unit policy that no prisoner would leave alive.

## The Experiments
Unit 731's research aimed to push the human body to its limits and develop weapons of mass destruction.

### Vivisection
Researchers performed surgery on conscious victims without anesthesia. They believed that anesthesia would alter the body's natural reaction to pathogens.
*   Organs were removed to study the effects of diseases like plague or cholera.
*   Limbs were amputated to study blood loss.
*   Esophaguses were attached to intestines, and other grotesque surgical reconfigurations were attempted.
*   Pregnant women, impregnated by guards, were dissected to study fetus transmission of disease.

### Frostbite and Pressure
*   **Frostbite Studies:** Victims were tied to posts in the freezing Manchurian winter, doused with water, and left until their limbs froze solid. Guards would strike the limbs with clubs; if they sounded like indiscriminate wood, the experiment proceeded. They tested various thawing methods (hot water, fire), often resulting in flesh sloughing off the bone.
*   **Vacuum Chambers:** Victims were placed in pressure chambers to simulate high-altitude conditions for pilots. The pressure was increased until the victims died, often with their eyeballs popping from their sockets.

### Weapons Testing
*   **Pathogens:** Prisoners were injected with syphilis, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, and anthrax.
*   **Field Tests:** Victims were tied to crosses in open fields and subjected to grenade shrapnel, flamethrowers, and chemical bomb releases to test kill radii.

## Biological Warfare on Civilians
The unit's work extended beyond the lab.
*   **Plague Bombs:** Ceramic bombs filled with plague-infected fleas provided by Unit 731 were dropped on Chinese cities like **Ningbo** and **Changde**.
*   **Water Supplies:** Cholera and typhoid cultures were dumped into village wells and rivers.
*   **Legacy:** Outbreaks of "rotten leg disease" and plague continued in these regions long after the war ended.

## The American Cover-Up: "Black Pact"

As the Soviet Army advanced in August 1945, Japan destroyed the facility, executing the remaining prisoners. **Shirō Ishii** ordered his subordinates to "take the secret to the grave."

### The Deal
However, when U.S. forces occupied Japan, they discovered the extent of the research. **General Douglas MacArthur** and U.S. biological warfare experts (from Camp Detrick) saw a unique opportunity. They believed the Japanese data—human data that the U.S. could never ethically obtain—gave them an edge against the Soviet Union.
*   **Immunity:** The U.S. secretly granted **immunity from prosecution** to Shirō Ishii and all Unit 731 researchers. They were not tried at the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal.
*   **The Exchange:** Ishii handed over 8,000 slides of tissues, hundreds of pages of autopsy reports, and detailed protocols on biological weapons.

### Impact
While Nazi doctors were hanged at Nuremberg, the "devils" of Unit 731 went free. Many became prominent members of post-war Japanese society:
*   The head of Green Cross (a major pharmaceutical company).
*   The Dean of a major medical university.
*   The Governor of Tokyo.

It was only in the 1990s and 2000s, through lawsuits by Chinese victims' families and American declassifications, that the full truth became undeniable globally.
