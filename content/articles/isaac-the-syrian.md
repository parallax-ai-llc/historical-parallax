## Summary

Isaac the Syrian (Isaac of Nineveh) was a 7th-century Syriac Christian bishop and monk whose ascetical writings became enormously influential in Eastern Christian mysticism. Despite serving as bishop for only five months, his writings on prayer, humility, and divine love are among the most treasured in both Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox traditions. His emphasis on God's overwhelming mercy and love profoundly influenced figures from Dostoevsky to modern theologians.
