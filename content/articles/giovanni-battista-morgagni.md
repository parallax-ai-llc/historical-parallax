## Summary

Giovanni Battista Morgagni is considered the father of modern anatomical pathology. His 1761 work De Sedibus et Causis Morborum (On the Seats and Causes of Diseases) was based on over 700 autopsies and established the correlation between clinical symptoms and post-mortem findings. This approach transformed medicine from symptom-based to organ-based diagnosis.
