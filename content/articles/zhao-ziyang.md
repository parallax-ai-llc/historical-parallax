## Summary

Zhao Ziyang (1919-2005) was a Chinese politician who served as Premier of China from 1980 to 1987 and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party from 1987 to 1989. A pioneering economic reformer, he implemented market-oriented policies that transformed China's economy during the 1980s, first in Sichuan Province and later nationwide. His political career ended abruptly when he opposed the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989, leading to his purge and fifteen years of house arrest until his death. His legacy remains controversial and largely censored in mainland China, though his secret memoirs revealed his evolution toward supporting liberal democracy.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Zhao Ziyang was born on October 17, 1919, as Zhao Xiuye in Huaxian County, Henan Province, into a wealthy landlord family that had accumulated their fortune through grain trading and land ownership.[^3][^4] During his childhood, Zhao received a traditional education, attending elementary school in his hometown before progressing to middle schools in Kaifeng and Wuhan. It was while attending middle school in Wuhan that he changed his given name from Xiuye to "Ziyang," reflecting classical literary influences.[^5][^6]

His family background would later haunt him throughout his political career. His father, a prosperous landlord in Hua County, Henan, was murdered by Chinese Communist Party officials during a land reform movement in the early 1940s.[^7] Despite this personal tragedy, or perhaps because of it, the young Zhao drew a distinct line between himself and his father's landlord class status. As a teenager in 1932, at just thirteen years old, Zhao joined the Communist Youth League, marking his commitment to the revolutionary cause.[^8] He became a full member of the Communist Party in 1938, at age nineteen.[^9]

During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and the subsequent Chinese Civil War (1945-1949), Zhao performed extremely dangerous work as an underground agent for the Communists, establishing his credentials as a veteran revolutionary.[^10] He served as chief officer of the CCP Hua County Committee, Director of the Organization Department of the CCP Yubei prefecture Party Committee, Secretary of the CCP Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Prefecture Party Committee, and Political Commissar of the 4th Military Division of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region.[^11] Though he served in the People's Liberation Army, his posts were largely administrative rather than combat-oriented.[^12] This underground revolutionary work during China's most turbulent years would provide the foundation for his later rise through the Communist Party hierarchy.

## Rise to Power

After the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Zhao Ziyang steadily climbed the ranks of the Communist Party. In 1965, at the notably young age of 46, he became Party Secretary of Guangdong Province, one of China's most important and populous regions.[^13] This appointment marked him as a rising star within the Party elite. However, his ascent was interrupted by the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

In 1967, Zhao was dismissed from all official positions and became a victim of the Cultural Revolution's political purges. He was paraded through Guangzhou wearing a dunce cap and publicly denounced as "a stinking remnant of the landlord class," a reference to his family background.[^14] He spent the next four years working as a fitter at the Xianzhong Mechanics Factory in Hunan, a dramatic fall from his previous position of power.[^15]

Zhao's political rehabilitation began in 1972 through the efforts of Premier Zhou Enlai, who recognized the need to restore capable administrators to manage China's bureaucracy as he himself grew increasingly ill with cancer.[^16] The rehabilitation occurred in stages: Zhao was appointed to the Central Committee in 1972 and became Revolutionary Committee Secretary and vice-chairman in Inner Mongolia in March of that year. In August 1973, he was elevated to the 10th Central Committee. By April 1974, he had returned to Guangdong as 1st CCP Secretary and Revolutionary Committee Chair.[^17]

The decisive turning point in Zhao's career came in 1975 when he was appointed Party Secretary of Sichuan, China's most populous province.[^18] At the time, Sichuan had been economically devastated by the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. The collective agricultural policies had collapsed the province's agricultural production to levels not seen since the 1930s, despite a great increase in population. The economic situation was so dire that citizens were reportedly selling their daughters for food.[^19] It was in this desperate context that Zhao would pioneer the economic reforms that would later transform all of China.

## Major Achievements

### The Sichuan Miracle (1975-1980)

Zhao Ziyang's most significant achievement was transforming Sichuan Province from economic catastrophe to prosperity through bold market-oriented reforms. With the backing of Deng Xiaoping, he introduced the contract-responsibility system in 1977, where families and individuals were assigned plots of land in return for promising to meet harvest quotas, with surplus crops sold to the state at higher prices or on the open market.[^20] He dismantled the communist commune system, restored private plots and sideline rural businesses, raised farm prices, and revived bonuses for extra work.[^21]

The results were extraordinary. Within three years, industrial production increased by 81% and agricultural output by 25%.[^22] Zhao's reforms made him so popular in Sichuan that local people coined the saying: "要吃粮, 找紫阳" (If you want to eat grain, find Ziyang).[^23] The "Sichuan Experience" became a model for nationwide economic reform and established Zhao's reputation as a pragmatic, effective administrator willing to challenge ideological orthodoxy for practical results.

### National Economic Leadership

Impressed by the success in Sichuan, Deng Xiaoping promoted Zhao to replace Hua Guofeng as Premier of the State Council in September 1980, with a mandate to introduce his rural reforms across China.[^24] As Premier, Zhao implemented many of the policies that had succeeded in Sichuan at a national scale, increasingly decentralizing industrial and agricultural production. Between 1980 and 1984, China's agricultural production rose by an astonishing 50%.[^25]

Zhao successfully established a series of special economic zones in coastal provinces to attract foreign investment and create export hubs.[^26] In 1987, at the Thirteenth Party Congress, he unveiled the coastal development strategy that has powered China's economic boom into the 21st century.[^27] In the same speech, Zhao pioneered the concept of the "primary stage of socialism," which argued that China needed total flexibility in policies and economic methods for at least 100 years rather than being constrained by Marxist-Maoist ideology.[^28] This theoretical innovation provided ideological justification for market reforms while maintaining the fiction of socialist orthodoxy.

### Political Reform Agenda

When Zhao became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 1987, succeeding Hu Yaobang, he turned his attention to political reforms. At the Thirteenth Party Congress in October 1987, he formally proposed making efforts to separate the responsibilities of the party and the state, strengthen the legal system and the supervisory and legislative work of people's congresses, restructure government by separating its functions from enterprise management, streamline state administration, reform the civil service, improve socialist democracy by cooperating with other political parties, hold elections, institute democratic management and supervision, and maintain stability and unity.[^29][^30]

Zhao's vision for China was one of simultaneous economic and political reform. He explicitly rejected the view that economic reform had to precede political reform or that political reform was unnecessary.[^31] He advocated for safeguarding the dignity of the constitution, strengthening the legal system, reforming the personnel system, streamlining the state apparatus, and implementing a large-scale anti-corruption program.[^32] These ambitious reforms, had they been implemented, would have fundamentally transformed China's political system.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Official Party Accusations

In the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen protests, Zhao was officially accused of "committing serious mistakes," specifically "[making] the mistake of supporting the turmoil and splitting the party" and having "unshirkable responsibilities for the development of the turmoil."[^33] These charges served as the official justification for his removal from power and subsequent house arrest.

### Political Misjudgments

Critics within the Party argued that Zhao repeated many of the mistakes of his predecessor Hu Yaobang and was "much more reckless as a leader than Hu," particularly in not adequately criticizing "bourgeois liberalism" and needlessly offending conservative leaders.[^34] Some hardliners blamed him for letting the student movement get out of control, arguing that his conciliatory approach wasted political capital trying to pacify radical students who did not want to be pacified.[^35] His rival Li Peng later accused Zhao of fomenting the Tiananmen protests exclusively for political gain.[^36]

### Economic Policy Failures

Conservatives in the Politburo grew increasingly disgruntled with Zhao's policies, blaming him for the economic downturn of the late 1980s.[^37] His proposal in May 1988 to accelerate price reform led to widespread complaints about rampant inflation, giving opponents of rapid reform the opportunity to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influence.[^38] Critics argued that his economic failures came because he ignored advisors and experts.[^39]

### Structural Reform Challenges

The second half of 1988 saw the increasing deterioration of Zhao's political support as he engaged in multi-front turf battles with Party elders, who grew increasingly dissatisfied with Zhao's hands-off approach to ideological matters.[^40] Zhao and other reformers were bumping into major contradictions inherent to the ambitious political structure reform program, particularly the sensitive plan of separating the Party and the state.[^41] Party conservatives, led by Li Xiannian, resented Zhao personally for his interest in foreign culture and his willingness to learn from economic models that had been successful outside of China.[^42]

### Western Cultural Influences

Zhao's adoption of Western styles and habits drew criticism from conservatives. He eschewed traditional Mao suits in favor of Western-style jackets and ties.[^43] He was an avid golfer and was the only top-level Party official relatively open about this hobby, regularly playing at Beijing International Golf Club near the famous Ming Tombs.[^44][^45] His willingness to appear on the American television news show "Meet the Press"—downing two beers on camera during his interview with Tom Brokaw—scandalized conservative Party members who saw this as undignified behavior for a Chinese leader.[^46]

---

## Personal Life

Zhao met his wife, Liang Boqi, in the late 1930s and early 1940s when he served as party chief of Hua County, where she was his subordinate. The couple married in 1944.[^47] Their partnership would endure for over sixty years, including the difficult final fifteen years when both were under house arrest in Beijing. Liang died peacefully at Beijing Hospital in 2013 at age 95, eight years after her husband's death.[^48]

Zhao was survived by five children: a daughter named Wang Yannan and four sons named Zhao Dajun, Zhao Erjun, and Zhao Wujun.[^49] During his house arrest, Zhao lived with his wife and his daughter's family in the innermost courtyard of their traditional siheyuan home at No. 6 Fuqiang Hutong, in the Dongcheng District of central Beijing, near Zhongnanhai.[^50]

Despite his political downfall, Zhao maintained his personal routines and interests. He was a 40-minute-a-day jogger and once revealed in an interview that he sometimes argued with his family at the dinner table and liked his grandchildren.[^51] His passion for golf continued even during house arrest; he was permitted out only for occasional trips to the golf course before his death. He had a personal coach, Peter Tang Shu-chuen from Hong Kong, who was remembered as the "godfather of China golf."[^52][^53]

During his house arrest, Zhao's political beliefs evolved significantly. He became much more radical in his political convictions, coming to support China's full transition to liberal democracy rather than the limited reforms he had advocated while in power.[^54] This transformation would be revealed in his secret memoirs, which he began recording in 1999.

---

## Legacy

### The Secret Memoirs

Between 1999 and 2000, Zhao secretly recorded his autobiography on approximately thirty cassette tapes, each about sixty minutes in length.[^55] Because he could only produce the tapes during periods when his guards were absent, the recording process took over a year.[^56] Zhao produced his audio journals by recording over inconspicuous low-quality tapes that were readily available in his home: children's music and Peking Opera.[^57] Zhao's family maintained they were completely unaware of the tapes' existence until contacted after his death.[^58]

After creating the tapes, Zhao smuggled them out of his residence by passing them to trusted friends. To minimize the risk that some tapes might be lost or confiscated, each participant was entrusted with only a small part of the total work.[^59] The memoirs were published in English in May 2009 under the title "Prisoner of the State: The Secret Journal of Premier Zhao Ziyang," timed to coincide with the twentieth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.[^60] The memoirs provide intimate details about the Tiananmen events, describe the political machinations among China's top leaders, and argue for the necessity of China adopting democracy to achieve long-term stability.[^61]

### Censorship and Official Silence

Because of his political fall from grace, Zhao was not given the funeral rites generally accorded to senior Chinese officials when he died in January 2005.[^62] There was no eulogy at the ceremony because the government and Zhao's family could not agree on its content: while the government wanted to say he made mistakes, his family refused to accept he did anything wrong.[^63]

The man who pioneered China's three-decade economic miracle became a political taboo, with his name censored from all official print and broadcast media to this day.[^64] Government efforts to delete Zhao's memory from public consciousness included airbrushing his picture from photographs released in China.[^65] His secret memoirs remain censored in China, though they circulate underground and are available outside the mainland.[^66]

### International Recognition

Outside of mainland China, Zhao's death produced calls from the governments of Taiwan and Japan urging the People's Republic of China to move toward granting the greater political freedoms that Zhao promoted.[^67] The White House praised Zhao, stating that he "was a man of moral courage who suffered great personal sacrifices for standing by his convictions during difficult times."[^68]

### Economic Impact

Zhao Ziyang's economic reforms fundamentally transformed China from a poverty-stricken command economy into an economic powerhouse. The coastal development strategy he unveiled in 1987 has indeed powered China's economic boom into the 21st century, exactly as he envisioned.[^69] His concept of the "primary stage of socialism" provided the ideological flexibility that allowed subsequent leaders to continue market reforms while maintaining Communist Party rule.[^70]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite his fall from grace, Zhao Ziyang is often remembered as a martyr for political reform in China and has posthumously gained respect among activists and intellectuals.[^71] Historians consider his memoirs as "required reading" for understanding modern Chinese political history, indicating the significance of his account for major events.[^72] China scholars recognize the importance of his secret memoirs, particularly given that his account of events remained unknown during his sixteen years under house arrest.[^73]

Zhao was favored and supported by many Chinese intellectuals in the 1980s as a patron of political reform.[^74] His advocacy of pragmatic, market-oriented policies over ideological purity represented a decisive break with Maoist economics. The success of his Sichuan reforms demonstrated that decentralization, material incentives, and individual initiative could dramatically improve productivity where collectivization and central planning had failed.[^75]

Supporters argue that had Zhao's political reforms been implemented, China might have evolved into a more democratic society while maintaining political stability. His vision of separating party and state functions, strengthening the legal system, and increasing transparency represented a genuine attempt to modernize China's political institutions alongside its economy.[^76] The fact that he was willing to risk—and ultimately sacrifice—his position to oppose violent suppression of protesters has earned him enduring respect among advocates of political reform.[^77]

### Negative Views

Conservative critics within the Communist Party maintain that Zhao committed serious errors in handling the 1989 protests, arguing that his conciliatory approach emboldened protesters and made a forceful response inevitable.[^78] They contend that his "mistake of supporting the turmoil and splitting the party" justified his removal from power.[^79]

Some scholars, including Richard Baum, argue that even Zhao's thoughts on political reform "stressed the need for strong, centralized technocratic leadership," suggesting he wasn't truly an advocate of Western-style democracy but rather of more efficient authoritarianism.[^80] Critics note that Zhao was characterized as "more policy wonk than charismatic leader," lacking the political skills necessary to navigate elite Communist Party politics successfully.[^81]

Hardliners blamed Zhao for the economic problems of the late 1980s, particularly the inflation that accompanied his price reform proposals.[^82] They argued that he was reckless in pushing reforms too quickly without adequate consideration of potential negative consequences. His conflicts with conservative leaders, whom he "needlessly offended," demonstrated poor political judgment that undermined his reform agenda.[^83]

The scholarly consensus recognizes Zhao as an important reformer whose political agenda was more radical than publicly stated, though still operating within a technocratic socialist framework rather than advocating Western democratic systems.[^84] Some historians argue that Zhao's own account in his memoirs may be self-serving, attempting to justify his actions and minimize his own mistakes during the turbulent events of 1989.[^85]
