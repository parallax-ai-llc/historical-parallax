## Summary

Jiao Yu (焦玉) was a Chinese military general, philosopher, and writer who served during the late Yuan dynasty and early Ming dynasty under Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming dynasty.[^1] As a leading artillery officer, he played a crucial role in the Red Turban Rebellion that overthrew the Mongol Yuan dynasty, utilizing advanced gunpowder weapons to secure key military victories.[^2] He is best known for co-editing the Huolongjing (Fire Drake Manual), a comprehensive 14th-century military treatise documenting Chinese gunpowder weapons technology, and was later appointed to the prestigious title of Count of Dongning and head officer of the Shen Zhi Ying Armory.[^3][^4]

## Early Life and Background

Jiao Yu was born around 1330 during the final decades of the Mongol-ruled Yuan dynasty in China.[^5] In his youth, Jiao was an aspiring Confucian scholar with ambitions for governmental service, though his prospects were severely limited by Yuan dynasty policies that restricted Chinese access to administrative positions.[^6] The Mongol rulers had abolished the traditional civil service examination system until 1315, and even after its restoration, the system favored Mongols and other foreigners over Han Chinese scholars.[^7][^8] Chinese candidates faced more stringent requirements than their Mongol counterparts, and of the 300 jinshi degrees awarded, specific quotas ensured Chinese scholars received only the lowest bureaucratic positions.[^9]

Unable to secure a promising political future through conventional scholarly channels, Jiao Yu's life took a transformative turn when he met an adept Daoist intellectual known as Chichi Daoren (赤赤道人, the "Knowing-when-to-stop Daoist") living in the Tiantai Mountains.[^10] This Daoist master recognized Jiao's potential and became his mentor, introducing him to military strategy and the philosophy of warfare. Like Jiao Yu, Daoren accepted Confucian teachings of Confucius and Mencius, but in military affairs convinced Jiao that he had inherited the strategic wisdom of the ancient military philosopher Sun Tzu.[^11]

Chichi Daoren played a pivotal role in redirecting Jiao Yu's career, sharing with him various literary works on "fire-weapons" and their recorded uses in battle.[^12] Most significantly, Daoren urged his protégé to join the cause of Zhu Yuanzhang's rebellion against the Mongol overlords.[^13] This mentorship equipped Jiao with both the technical knowledge of gunpowder warfare and the ideological conviction necessary to challenge the Yuan dynasty, setting him on the path that would make him one of the Ming dynasty's most important military technologists.

## Rise to Power

Jiao Yu joined Zhu Yuanzhang's rebel forces during the Red Turban Rebellion, a widespread peasant uprising against Mongol rule that began in 1351.[^14] By 1355, when Zhu Yuanzhang had amassed an army of 30,000 soldiers and assumed leadership following the death of rebel leader Guo Zixing, Jiao Yu had already established himself as an expert in artillery and gunpowder weapons.[^15][^16] Zhu Yuanzhang, who would later become the Hongwu Emperor and founder of the Ming dynasty, recognized Jiao's exceptional technical expertise and appointed him as a leading artillery officer for the rebel army.[^17]

Jiao Yu's fire-weapons proved instrumental in Zhu's military campaigns. In the preface to the Huolongjing, Jiao claimed to describe gunpowder weapons that had seen use since 1355 during his involvement in the Red Turban Rebellion.[^18] With the aid of Jiao's fire-weapons, Zhu's army, once stationed in Hezhou among numerous rival rebel groups, conquered Jingzhou and Xiangzhou in one expedition.[^19] In the second expedition, the provinces of Jiang and Zhe fell to Zhu's forces, and in the third campaign, the entire province of Fujian was taken, including its surrounding waterways.[^20] Following these successes, Zhu's army captured the whole of Shandong in one campaign.[^21]

The Battle of Lake Poyang in 1363 represented one of the largest naval engagements in history and demonstrated the extensive deployment of gunpowder weapons in Zhu's arsenal.[^22] According to Ming sources, Zhu's fleet arrived armed with "fire bombs, fire guns, fire arrows, fire seeds [probably grenades], large and small fire lances, large and small 'commander' fire-tubes, large and small iron bombs, rockets."[^23] On August 30, Zhu's fleet engaged rival warlord Chen Youliang's forces under orders to "get close to the enemy's ships and first set off gunpowder weapons (發火器), then bows and crossbows, and finally attack their ships with short-range weapons."[^24][^25] Zhu's forces particularly relied on their "bowl-mouthed cannons" (碗口铳, wankouchong)—short-barreled, wide-bore guns that, while lacking range and accuracy, could devastate enemy ships at close quarters.[^26][^27] Though ultimately fire ships rather than guns proved decisive in the battle, the extensive use of gunpowder weapons marked a turning point in Chinese military technology.[^28]

## Major Achievements

### Leadership in Firearms Manufacturing

After the successful establishment of the Ming dynasty in 1368, Jiao Yu's expertise became even more valuable to the new government.[^29] The Hongwu Emperor charged Jiao with manufacturing firearms for the government and eventually appointed him as head officer of the enormous Shen Zhi Ying Armory, where vast quantities of manufactured guns and artillery were deposited for storage and safekeeping.[^30][^31] This position reflected the critical importance the early Ming dynasty placed on maintaining technological superiority in gunpowder weapons.

The Hongwu Emperor created a Bureau of Armaments tasked with producing 3,000 handheld firearms and other weapons every three years.[^32] By 1380, twelve years after the Ming dynasty's founding, the Ming army boasted around 130,000 gunners out of its 1.3 to 1.8 million strong army.[^33] Early Ming military codes stipulated that ideally 10 percent of all soldiers should be gunners, representing a significant commitment to firearms technology.[^34] Safety concerns were taken seriously during Jiao's administration, particularly given memories of disasters such as Prime Minister Zhao Nanchong's personal arsenal catching fire and exploding in 1260 AD during the Song dynasty.[^35]

### The Huolongjing (Fire Drake Manual)

Jiao Yu's most enduring contribution was co-editing the Huolongjing (火龍經, Fire Dragon Manual), alongside the scholar, general, and court adviser Liu Bowen (Liu Ji, 1311-1375).[^36][^37] Liu Ji was a Chinese military strategist, philosopher, and politician who served as a key advisor to Zhu Yuanzhang during the struggle to overthrow the Yuan dynasty.[^38] The earliest edition of the Huolongjing was written by Jiao Yu sometime between 1360-1375, though its preface was not provided until the Nanyang publication of 1412.[^39][^40]

The Huolongjing served as a comprehensive guide to gunpowder weapons and their military applications during the 1280s to 1350s.[^41] The treatise documented an extraordinary array of weapons and technologies including fire arrows, fire lances, early grenades, firearms, matchlocks, bombards, cannons, exploding cannonballs, land mines, naval mines, rockets, rocket launchers, two-stage rockets, and various specialized gunpowder formulations including poisonous concoctions.[^42][^43] By Jiao Yu's time in the mid-14th century, the explosive potential of gunpowder had been perfected, with nitrate levels in gunpowder formulas ranging from 12% to 91%, representing at least six different formulas for specialized applications.[^44][^45]

### Revolutionary Weapons Systems

The Huolongjing described several groundbreaking innovations that represented significant advances in military technology:

**Two-Stage Rockets**: The manual documented the oldest known multistage rocket, the "fire-dragon issuing from the water" (huo long chu shui, 火龙出水), which was used by the Chinese navy.[^46][^47] This weapon consisted of a hollow bamboo tube about 1.5 meters long with a carved wooden dragon head and tail, containing four rockets packed with gunpowder for propulsion.[^48] Operating as a two-stage rocket, the carrier or booster rockets would automatically ignite a swarm of smaller rocket-arrows hidden inside the dragon's belly when about to burn out, which then issued through the dragon's mouth toward enemy targets.[^49][^50] The design was intended primarily for naval warfare.[^51]

**Land Mines**: Although the first recorded use of land mines dated to 1277 AD when Song Dynasty officer Lou Qianxia created them against invading Mongol troops, Jiao Yu provided detailed descriptions of their construction and operation.[^52][^53] He wrote that land mines were spherical, made of cast iron, with fuses ignited by enemy movement disturbing a trigger mechanism.[^54] While the Huolongjing did not elaborate on trigger mechanisms, a later Ming text from 1606 revealed a complex system involving pin releases, dropping weights, cords and axles working to rotate a spinning "steel wheel" that acted as flint to provide sparks igniting underground fuses.[^55]

**Naval Mines**: Jiao Yu provided the first description of naval mines, documenting the "submarine dragon-king" (shui di long wang pao, 水底龙王炮).[^56] These mines were made of wrought iron, carried on submerged wooden boards weighted with stones, with firing mechanisms consisting of floating incense sticks that lit the fuse when burning down, the fuse contained in goat's intestine and connecting to explosive charges floated at specific depths.[^57][^58] This innovation represented a significant advancement in naval warfare technology.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Historical Accuracy and Misattribution

The Huolongjing has faced significant scholarly criticism regarding its historical accuracy and attribution practices. Both the original publication and the 1412 Nanyang edition falsely attributed the earliest passages of the book to the ancient Chinese Prime Minister Zhuge Liang (181-234 AD) of the Shu Kingdom.[^59] This attribution was demonstrably anachronistic, as gunpowder warfare did not exist in China until the advent of the gunpowder-fuse-ignited flamethrower (Pen Huo Qi) in the 10th century.[^60][^61] The oldest passages actually found in the Huolongjing were made no earlier than circa 1270-1280 AD, approximately 1,000 years after Zhuge Liang's death.[^62][^63]

This false attribution appears to have been an attempt to lend authority and prestige to the text by associating it with one of China's most revered historical strategists. Such practices were not uncommon in Chinese military literature, where authors often invoked ancient authorities to legitimize their work, but modern scholars view this as undermining the text's credibility as a purely historical document.

### Discrepancies with Archaeological Evidence

Modern scholarship has identified inconsistencies between the Huolongjing's descriptions and surviving physical evidence. The treatise purports to describe Chinese firearms of the late 13th to mid-14th centuries, yet many surviving guns from that period do not resemble those illustrated in the Huolongjing and appear to fit better with 16th-century designs.[^64] Furthermore, some firearms from the 14th century are not mentioned at all in the text.[^65] These discrepancies raise questions about whether the Huolongjing accurately reflects weapons actually in use during Jiao Yu's lifetime or whether it incorporates later additions and modifications.

Complicating this issue, the earliest available editions of the Huolongjing date to the 16th century, centuries after Jiao Yu's purported compilation period of 1360-1375.[^66] This temporal gap allows for the possibility that later editors added, modified, or updated content to reflect contemporary weapons technology rather than preserving original 14th-century descriptions.

### Limited Biographical Information

Unlike many of his contemporaries who served the Ming dynasty, Jiao Yu's biography does not appear in the official Ming historical text, the Ming Shi (明史, compiled in 1739).[^67] This omission is unusual for someone who held the prestigious title of Count of Dongning and served in such a critical military capacity. While Jiao Yu was mentioned in later works including Zhao Shizhen's Shenqipu (1598 AD), He Rubin's Binglu (1606 AD), and Jiao Xu's Zekelu (1643 AD), the absence of an official biography has made it difficult for historians to verify many details of his life, including precise birth and death dates.[^68]

The lack of detailed personal information also means that historians cannot fully assess Jiao Yu's individual contributions versus those of his co-editor Liu Bowen, or determine how much of the Huolongjing represents original work versus compilation of existing knowledge. Some scholars have questioned whether the 1412 preface attributed to Jiao Yu was actually written by him or added posthumously by later editors.

## Personal Life

Very little is known about Jiao Yu's personal life, family, or relationships, as historical records focus almost exclusively on his military achievements and technical contributions.[^69] The absence of his biography from the official Ming Shi has compounded this lack of personal information, leaving historians with few sources to reconstruct his private life.[^70]

What is known suggests a man deeply influenced by both Confucian and Daoist philosophy. His early aspiration to become a Confucian scholar indicates he received classical education in the Confucian curriculum, studying the works of Confucius and Mencius.[^71] However, his relationship with his Daoist mentor Chichi Daoren suggests he maintained an eclectic philosophical outlook, comfortable integrating different intellectual traditions—a characteristic approach during the Yuan-Ming transition period.

Jiao's appointment to the noble status of Count of Dongning (東寧伯) indicates he achieved significant social elevation through his military service.[^72] This title would have brought considerable prestige, land grants, and hereditary privileges for his family, though no records survive detailing whether he had children or what became of his descendants. The Nanyang publication of 1412, which featured a preface attributed to Jiao Yu, suggests he lived into his eighties, remaining intellectually active decades after the Ming dynasty's founding.[^73]

His personality, as inferred from his works and career trajectory, suggests a pragmatic intellectual who successfully navigated the transition from Yuan to Ming rule. Unlike pure scholars who might have disdained military service, Jiao embraced the practical application of technical knowledge to achieve both military success and political advancement. His willingness to work with gunpowder weapons—technology viewed by some traditionalists as contrary to Confucian values of ritual warfare—indicates flexibility and adaptability.

## Legacy

### Influence on Chinese Military Technology

Jiao Yu's legacy centers on his role in documenting and advancing Chinese gunpowder weapon technology during a critical period of development.[^74] The Huolongjing stands as one of the most important historical documents on early Chinese military technology, providing scholars with detailed information about 14th-century Chinese warfare that would otherwise be lost.[^75][^76] The treatise probably represents a compilation of the best military technology of his time, including various compositions of gunpowder, hollow cast-iron grenade bombs, cannons, handguns, rocket launchers, winged rockets with fins, and other innovations.[^77]

The Ming dynasty's early military successes, particularly against Mongol forces and in establishing control over China, owed much to the gunpowder weapons technology that Jiao Yu helped manufacture and deploy.[^78] The establishment of dedicated firearms manufacturing facilities under his leadership created institutional capacity that would serve the Ming military for decades. By 1380, the Ming army's 130,000 gunners represented approximately 10 percent of total forces, a proportion that reflected Jiao's vision of gunpowder weapons as integral rather than supplementary to military operations.[^79][^80]

### Impact on Global Military History

The Huolongjing documented technologies that would eventually influence military development far beyond China. The two-stage rocket described in the manual represented a conceptual breakthrough that anticipated modern multistage rocketry by centuries.[^81] The land mine and naval mine designs documented fundamental principles of explosive warfare that would be independently rediscovered and refined by later military engineers worldwide.[^82][^83] Fins for rockets to increase aerodynamic stability, as described by Jiao Yu, became standard in rocket design globally.[^84]

China's development of gunpowder weapons technology during Jiao Yu's era has led scholars to characterize Ming China as a "gunpowder empire," comparable to the Ottoman Empire and other early modern states that leveraged firearms technology for military advantage.[^85] The Hongwu Emperor's systematic investment in firearms production and deployment represented one of the earliest examples of state-sponsored military-industrial capacity focused on gunpowder weapons.[^86]

### Scholarly Significance

The Huolongjing remains an essential primary source for military historians studying the development of gunpowder technology and its military applications.[^87] Despite controversies over attribution and accuracy, the text provides unparalleled detail about 14th-century Chinese military thinking regarding the tactical deployment of various gunpowder weapons. The manual's systematic organization—covering everything from gunpowder formulations to specific weapons systems to tactical deployment—represented an early attempt at comprehensive military-technical documentation.[^88]

Modern scholars studying the history of chemistry, pyrotechnics, rocketry, and military engineering regularly consult the Huolongjing as a primary source.[^89] The various gunpowder formulations documented in the text, with nitrate percentages ranging from 12% to 91%, provide evidence of sophisticated experimentation and understanding of explosive chemistry.[^90] This represents a significant intellectual achievement, as it demonstrates empirical methodology in military technology development centuries before the scientific revolution.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars praising Jiao Yu emphasize his role in preserving and advancing Chinese military technology during a crucial historical period. The New World Encyclopedia describes him as a critical figure whose fire-weapons expertise directly contributed to the establishment of the Ming dynasty, one of China's most celebrated imperial periods.[^91] His appointment as Count of Dongning and head of the Shen Zhi Ying Armory reflects the high regard in which the Hongwu Emperor held his abilities.[^92]

Military historians value Jiao Yu's systematic approach to documenting gunpowder weapons technology. Unlike fragmentary accounts in earlier texts, the Huolongjing provided comprehensive coverage of available weapons, their construction, gunpowder formulations, and tactical applications.[^93] This systematic documentation preserved knowledge that might otherwise have been lost, creating a resource that influenced subsequent generations of Chinese military thinkers and continues to inform modern scholarship.[^94]

Historians of science and technology credit Jiao Yu with documenting innovations that demonstrated China's technological sophistication during the 14th century. The multistage rocket concept, in particular, represents a remarkable engineering achievement that anticipated by centuries the principles underlying modern space exploration technology.[^95] The naval mine designs showed sophisticated understanding of waterproofing, timing mechanisms, and explosive effects underwater—all technically challenging problems requiring innovative solutions.[^96]

His practical contributions to Ming military success receive significant praise. The conquests of Jingzhou, Xiangzhou, Jiang, Zhe, Fujian, and Shandong provinces, all aided by Jiao's fire-weapons, were essential to Zhu Yuanzhang's consolidation of power.[^97] Without the technological advantage provided by advanced gunpowder weapons and Jiao's expertise in deploying them, the Ming dynasty's founding might have taken a very different course.

### Negative Views

Critics of Jiao Yu focus primarily on questions of historical accuracy and scholarly integrity regarding the Huolongjing. The false attribution of passages to Zhuge Liang seriously undermines the text's credibility as a historical source.[^98] This deliberate misattribution suggests either that Jiao Yu himself engaged in intellectual dishonesty to enhance his work's prestige, or that later editors corrupted his text—neither interpretation reflects well on the work's scholarly value.

The discrepancies between the Huolongjing's descriptions and surviving archaeological evidence raise questions about whether the text accurately represents 14th-century technology or incorporates later additions.[^99][^100] Some scholars suggest the available editions reflect 16th-century revisions rather than authentic 14th-century content, which would mean attributing too much innovation to Jiao Yu based on anachronistic evidence. This uncertainty complicates efforts to assess his actual contributions versus those of later editors and commentators.

The absence of Jiao Yu's biography from the official Ming Shi has led some historians to question how significant his contemporaries actually considered him.[^101] While officials often excluded from official histories might later gain recognition, the Ming Shi's compilers in 1739 had access to comprehensive records and chose not to include Jiao Yu despite his supposedly prestigious title and important military role. This omission might suggest that later generations inflated his significance beyond what his contemporaries recognized.

Some military historians note that while gunpowder weapons featured prominently in Zhu Yuanzhang's arsenal, they were not always decisive in achieving victory. At the Battle of Lake Poyang, despite extensive deployment of guns, cannons, and other gunpowder weapons, ultimately fire ships rather than firearms proved decisive.[^102] This suggests that while Jiao Yu's expertise contributed to Ming success, it may not have been as crucial as some accounts suggest, and traditional naval tactics remained more important than technological innovation.

Critics also note that attributing specific innovations to Jiao Yu personally remains problematic. The Huolongjing was co-edited with Liu Bowen, and much of its content compiled from earlier sources.[^103] Distinguishing Jiao's original contributions from borrowed material, Liu Bowen's additions, and later editorial changes proves nearly impossible given the available evidence. This uncertainty means that specific achievements often attributed to Jiao Yu might actually belong to others or represent collective rather than individual accomplishment.
