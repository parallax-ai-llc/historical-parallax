## Overview

The Great Depression (1929-1939) was the worst economic crisis in modern history, devastating the global economy and reshaping politics worldwide. Beginning with the U.S. stock market crash of October 1929 ("Black Tuesday"), the depression spread to virtually every country. At its worst, U.S. unemployment reached 25%, industrial production fell by half, and world trade collapsed by 65%. Banks failed by the thousands. Breadlines and Hoovervilles became symbols of the era. The Depression transformed government, leading to the New Deal in America and contributing to the rise of fascism in Europe. It ended only with World War II.

## Causes

### 1920s Boom

**"Roaring Twenties":**
- Stock prices soared (300% from 1924-1929)
- Consumer credit expanded
- Real estate speculation (Florida bubble 1926)
- Overproduction in agriculture and industry

### Stock Market Speculation

**Buying on Margin:**
Investors borrowed up to 90% of stock value. Prices disconnected from reality.

**Everyone Played:**
Middle class, even working class invested. "Everyone ought to be rich."

### Structural Weaknesses

- Wealth inequality (top 1% owned 40%)
- Weak agricultural sector
- European war debts and reparations
- Fragile banking system (no deposit insurance)
- Gold standard constraints
