## Summary
Aileen Carol Wuornos was an American serial killer who murdered seven men in Florida between 1989 and 1990. She claimed all the killings were in self-defense against men who had raped or attempted to rape her while she was working as a sex worker. Wuornos became one of the most well-known female serial killers in history, and her life was depicted in the 2003 film "Monster."

## Early Life
Aileen Wuornos was born on February 29, 1956, in Rochester, Michigan. Her father, Leo Dale Pittman, was a convicted child molester who hanged himself in prison. She was abandoned by her mother at age four and raised by her grandparents. She suffered sexual abuse and became pregnant at 14 from an alleged rape. She was sent to a home for unwed mothers, and her child was given up for adoption. After her grandfather's death, she lived on the streets and survived through sex work. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between November 1989 and November 1990, Wuornos killed seven men along Florida highways. Her victims were middle-aged men whom she encountered while hitchhiking or working as a sex worker. She shot each victim with a .22 caliber pistol and stole their belongings and vehicles. She maintained throughout her trial and imprisonment that the killings were acts of self-defense. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Wuornos was arrested on January 9, 1991, at a biker bar in Volusia County, Florida. Her companion, Tyria Moore, cooperated with police and recorded phone calls in which Wuornos made incriminating statements. She was convicted of six of the seven murders and sentenced to death. After years on death row, she waived her appeals and was executed by lethal injection on October 9, 2002. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- Her case brought attention to the cycle of abuse and trauma experienced by many who enter sex work [^4]
- Sparked important discussions about self-defense laws and the treatment of sex workers in the justice system
- Her troubled life story highlighted failures in the child welfare system

## Negative Perspectives
- Murdered seven men over a one-year period [^5]
- Robbed her victims of money, vehicles, and personal belongings
- The self-defense claims were inconsistent across victims and contradicted by evidence
- Her crimes instilled fear in communities along Florida highways
