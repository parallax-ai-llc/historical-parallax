## Summary

August Kekulé was a German organic chemist who was the principal founder of the theory of chemical structure. He proposed the tetravalence of carbon and the structure of benzene as a ring of six carbon atoms. His famous dream of the ouroboros (a snake biting its tail) reportedly inspired the benzene ring structure. Kekulé's structural theory became the foundation of organic chemistry.
