## Summary

Sir Andrew John Wiles is a British mathematician renowned for proving Fermat's Last Theorem, one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics for over 350 years[^1]. Born in Cambridge, England in 1953, Wiles dedicated seven years of solitary work to achieve this monumental breakthrough, which he announced in 1993 and fully proved in 1995[^2]. His proof revolutionized number theory by establishing the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, connecting two previously disparate areas of mathematics[^3]. For this achievement, Wiles received numerous honors including knighthood, the Abel Prize, and a special tribute from the Clay Mathematics Institute[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Andrew John Wiles was born on April 11, 1953, in Cambridge, England, to Maurice Frank Wiles and Patricia Wiles (née Mowll)[^5]. His father was the Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford, creating an academic atmosphere that would influence young Andrew's intellectual development[^6]. The family moved to Nigeria for a year when Andrew was a child, where his father served as a chaplain, before returning to Oxford[^7].

Wiles discovered his passion for mathematics at the remarkably young age of ten when he encountered Fermat's Last Theorem in a library book[^8]. The problem, stated by Pierre de Fermat in 1637, claimed that no three positive integers a, b, and c could satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than 2[^9]. This deceptively simple statement had eluded mathematicians for over three centuries, and the young Wiles became captivated by the challenge[^10].

He attended King's College School in Cambridge before matriculating at Merton College, Oxford, where he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics in 1974[^11]. His exceptional talent was evident early on, and he continued his studies at Clare College, Cambridge, completing his PhD in 1980 under the supervision of John Coates[^12]. His doctoral thesis focused on elliptic curves, a subject that would prove instrumental in his later triumph[^13].

During his graduate studies, Wiles developed expertise in Iwasawa theory and the arithmetic of elliptic curves, building the foundational knowledge that would eventually enable his assault on Fermat's Last Theorem[^14]. His early research demonstrated a profound understanding of algebraic number theory and established him as a rising star in the mathematical community[^15].

---

## Rise to Prominence

After completing his doctorate, Wiles accepted a position as Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University in 1982, where he would spend most of his career[^16]. Throughout the 1980s, he established himself as a leading expert in number theory, publishing significant work on elliptic curves and modular forms[^17]. His collaboration with mathematicians like Barry Mazur yielded important results that advanced the field considerably[^18].

The turning point in Wiles's career came in 1986 when Ken Ribet proved that the Taniyama-Shimura-Weil conjecture (now known as the modularity theorem) would imply Fermat's Last Theorem[^19]. This connection transformed Fermat's problem from an isolated puzzle into a central question in modern mathematics[^20]. Ribet's work demonstrated that if every elliptic curve could be shown to be modular, then Fermat's Last Theorem would necessarily be true[^21].

Upon learning of Ribet's result, Wiles made the extraordinary decision to abandon all other research and dedicate himself exclusively to proving the modularity theorem for a special class of elliptic curves[^22]. This decision was highly unusual in modern mathematics, where collaboration and regular publication are typically expected[^23]. Wiles worked in near-total secrecy for seven years, confiding only in his wife and occasionally consulting with his former supervisor Nicholas Katz[^24].

During this period of intense solitary research from 1986 to 1993, Wiles developed new mathematical techniques and synthesized ideas from multiple areas of mathematics[^25]. He drew upon Galois representations, the theory of modular forms, and sophisticated methods from algebraic geometry[^26]. His work required mastering and extending some of the most advanced mathematical machinery available[^27].

---

## Major Achievements

Wiles's crowning achievement came in June 1993 when he announced his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem at a lecture series at the Isaac Newton Institute in Cambridge[^28]. The announcement sent shockwaves through the mathematical community and made international headlines, bringing pure mathematics to public attention in an unprecedented way[^29]. The proof consisted of over 100 pages of dense mathematical reasoning and introduced groundbreaking new techniques[^30].

However, the story took a dramatic turn when peer review revealed a gap in the proof in September 1993[^31]. The error involved a specific construction in Wiles's use of Euler systems, and for several months it appeared that the proof might be irreparably flawed[^32]. This period was described by Wiles as the most difficult time of his professional life, as he struggled to repair the argument while under intense scrutiny[^33].

In a remarkable twist, Wiles collaborated with his former student Richard Taylor and discovered that by combining the flawed approach with an earlier method he had abandoned, they could circumvent the gap[^34]. The corrected proof was published in 1995 in the Annals of Mathematics across two papers: Wiles's "Modular elliptic curves and Fermat's Last Theorem" and a joint paper with Taylor addressing the critical repair[^35].

The proof's significance extends far beyond settling Fermat's Last Theorem itself. Wiles proved the modularity theorem for semistable elliptic curves, which established a deep connection between two major areas of mathematics: elliptic curves and modular forms[^36]. This work laid essential groundwork for later generalizations, and the full modularity theorem was completed by other mathematicians building on Wiles's methods[^37].

Wiles's techniques have had far-reaching applications throughout number theory and arithmetic geometry[^38]. His methods for proving modularity have been adapted and extended to prove numerous other results, making his work foundational to modern number theory[^39]. The proof demonstrated the power of connecting different mathematical domains and exemplified the deep unity underlying mathematics[^40].

For his achievement, Wiles received an extraordinary array of honors. In 1996, he was awarded a special tribute by the International Mathematical Union, as he was technically over the age limit for the Fields Medal[^41]. He received the Wolf Prize in 1995/96, the Royal Medal in 1996, the Cole Prize in 1997, and the Clay Research Award in 1999[^42]. In 2000, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming Sir Andrew Wiles[^43]. In 2016, he received the Abel Prize, mathematics' most prestigious honor, specifically for his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem[^44].

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Wiles's achievement is universally celebrated in the mathematical community, certain aspects of his approach and the subsequent treatment of his work have generated discussion and mild controversy. His decision to work in complete isolation for seven years, while ultimately successful, has been criticized by some as antithetical to the collaborative spirit increasingly valued in modern mathematics[^45]. Some commentators have suggested that earlier consultation with colleagues might have identified the gap in his initial proof more quickly[^46].

The intense media attention surrounding the announcement and the subsequent discovery of the error created an uncomfortable situation for the mathematical community[^47]. Some mathematicians expressed concern that the public drama of the gap and its repair might have damaged public confidence in mathematical proof[^48]. The episode highlighted tensions between the traditional peer review process in mathematics and the modern demand for immediate public dissemination of results[^49].

There has been debate about the accessibility of Wiles's proof, which requires extremely specialized knowledge to understand fully[^50]. Critics have noted that only a small number of mathematicians worldwide possess the necessary background to verify the proof independently[^51]. This has raised philosophical questions about the nature of mathematical certainty when proofs become so complex that they cannot be widely verified[^52].

Some historians of mathematics have criticized the disproportionate attention given to Fermat's Last Theorem compared to other significant mathematical achievements[^53]. They argue that the problem, while historically famous, was somewhat isolated from the main currents of mathematical research until Ribet connected it to the modularity conjecture[^54]. These critics suggest that equally important mathematical breakthroughs receive far less recognition simply because they lack the dramatic historical narrative[^55].

Additionally, discussions about credit and collaboration have emerged regarding Richard Taylor's contribution to repairing the proof[^56]. While Wiles is universally recognized as the primary architect of the proof, Taylor's crucial role in resolving the critical gap has led some to argue that the achievement should be viewed as more collaborative than it is often portrayed[^57].

## Personal Life

Andrew Wiles married Nada Canaan, who also has a mathematics background, in 1988[^58]. The couple has three daughters: Clare, Kate, and Olivia[^59]. Wiles has spoken about how his wife was one of the very few people who knew about his secret project to prove Fermat's Last Theorem during those seven years of isolated work[^60]. Her support during this intensive period, and especially during the difficult months after the gap was discovered, was crucial to his ultimate success[^61].

Colleagues describe Wiles as modest and reserved, uncomfortable with the celebrity status his proof brought him[^62]. Unlike some prominent mathematicians, he has generally avoided the public spotlight, preferring to focus on his research and teaching[^63]. He is known for being an exceptionally dedicated and thorough researcher, willing to spend years mastering technical material before beginning work on a problem[^64].

In interviews, Wiles has revealed a deeply philosophical approach to mathematics, viewing it as a quest for truth and beauty rather than merely solving puzzles[^65]. He has described the experience of mathematical discovery as akin to exploring a dark mansion room by room, gradually illuminating what was always there[^66]. This poetic sensibility contrasts with his rigorous technical work and reveals the aesthetic dimension of his mathematical thinking[^67].

Wiles has remained active in research after proving Fermat's Last Theorem, though he has acknowledged that nothing could match the intensity and focus of those seven years[^68]. He continues to work on problems in number theory and has mentored numerous graduate students at Princeton and Oxford[^69]. Despite his fame, he maintains the habits of a working mathematician, attending seminars and engaging with current research[^70].

## Legacy

Andrew Wiles's legacy in mathematics is secure as one of the most significant achievements of the late twentieth century[^71]. His proof of Fermat's Last Theorem stands as a monument to human intellectual achievement, demonstrating that even problems that have resisted solution for centuries can eventually yield to sufficiently powerful methods[^72]. The proof itself has become a standard example in the philosophy of mathematics, illustrating the cumulative nature of mathematical knowledge and the importance of connecting different areas of research[^73].

Beyond the specific theorem, Wiles's methods have fundamentally shaped modern number theory[^74]. The techniques he developed for proving modularity have been extended and refined by subsequent researchers, leading to the complete proof of the modularity theorem by Breuil, Conrad, Diamond, and Taylor in 2001[^75]. This generalization has had profound implications throughout arithmetic geometry and number theory[^76].

Wiles's work directly enabled further breakthroughs, including the proof of other cases of the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture and advances in the Langlands program, one of the most ambitious projects in contemporary mathematics[^77]. His proof is a central pillar in the modern understanding of the deep relationships between different mathematical structures[^78].

The story of Wiles's achievement has also had significant cultural impact beyond mathematics[^79]. His proof brought mathematics into mainstream consciousness in a way few mathematical results ever do, inspiring documentaries, books, and countless articles[^80]. The narrative of a solitary genius working in secret to solve an ancient problem captured public imagination and has inspired a generation of students to pursue mathematics[^81].

In education, Wiles has influenced how advanced mathematics is taught and communicated[^82]. His willingness to discuss the emotional and intellectual journey of his proof has helped humanize mathematics for general audiences[^83]. The BBC documentary "Fermat's Last Theorem" and Simon Singh's popular book of the same name have made his story accessible to millions[^84].

Wiles's career has also raised important questions about how mathematical research should be conducted in the modern era[^85]. His successful solitary approach contrasts with the increasing emphasis on collaboration and interdisciplinary work, suggesting that different problems may require fundamentally different research strategies[^86]. His example has given courage to other mathematicians pursuing long-term, high-risk research projects[^87].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

The mathematical community almost universally regards Wiles's proof as one of the supreme achievements of twentieth-century mathematics[^88]. Fields Medalist Gerd Faltings described the proof as "a moment when mathematics held its breath," recognizing both the technical brilliance and the historical significance of the achievement[^89]. The development of new techniques, particularly in connecting Galois representations with modular forms, has been praised as opening entirely new research directions[^90].

Scholars have emphasized how Wiles's work exemplifies the best traditions of pure mathematics: tackling problems for their intrinsic interest regardless of practical application, and in the process developing tools and insights that prove valuable far beyond the original question[^91]. Mathematician Ken Ribet, whose work directly enabled Wiles's approach, has called the proof "one of the great intellectual achievements of the century," noting its synthesis of ideas from across mathematics[^92].

The systematic and comprehensive nature of Wiles's approach has been particularly praised[^93]. Rather than seeking a clever trick specific to Fermat's equation, he pursued a deep structural understanding that illuminated fundamental connections in mathematics[^94]. This approach has been held up as a model for how to attack major problems: by placing them in a broader context and developing the necessary theoretical framework[^95].

Historians of mathematics have noted that Wiles's achievement vindicated centuries of work by countless mathematicians who contributed pieces to the eventual solution[^96]. His proof drew upon work ranging from nineteenth-century number theory to cutting-edge twentieth-century algebraic geometry, demonstrating the cumulative nature of mathematical progress[^97]. The proof has been described as a triumph not just for one individual but for the entire mathematical enterprise[^98].

### Negative Views

Some critics have argued that the intense focus on Fermat's Last Theorem was somewhat misplaced, as the problem itself was relatively isolated from mainstream mathematical research until it was connected to the modularity conjecture[^99]. These critics suggest that Wiles's real achievement was advancing the modularity program, and that the connection to Fermat, while historically interesting, is somewhat incidental to the mathematical significance[^100].

A few mathematicians have expressed concern about the complexity and specialization required to understand modern proofs like Wiles's[^101]. They worry that mathematics is becoming fragmented into narrow specialties where even professional mathematicians cannot follow work outside their immediate area[^102]. This raises questions about the communal verification of proofs and the unity of mathematics as a discipline[^103].

Some philosophical critics have questioned whether proofs of this complexity truly provide the certainty traditionally associated with mathematics[^104]. When only a handful of experts can fully verify a proof, skeptics ask whether we are relying more on authority and trust than on the transparent logical demonstration that characterizes classical mathematics[^105]. These concerns have led to calls for more emphasis on proof simplification and computer verification[^106].

There has also been criticism of the resource allocation in mathematics, with some arguing that the celebration of Wiles's achievement has reinforced a culture that overvalues solving famous old problems rather than developing new conceptual frameworks[^107]. Critics note that many significant advances in mathematics receive far less recognition because they lack the dramatic narrative of conquering a centuries-old challenge[^108].
