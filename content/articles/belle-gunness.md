## Summary
Belle Gunness was a Norwegian-American serial killer who murdered over 40 people at her Indiana farm between the 1880s and 1908. She lured suitors through matrimonial ads, killed them for their money, and may have faked her own death in a fire. Her true fate remains a mystery.

## Early Life
Born November 11, 1859, in Selbu, Norway. Emigrated to the US in 1881. Her first husband died in 1900 on the one day two insurance policies overlapped. She collected $8,500 and moved to La Porte, Indiana. [^1]

## Criminal Career
At her La Porte farm, Gunness placed ads in newspapers luring men with marriage promises. Suitors were told to bring cash and tell no one. They disappeared. She also murdered her second husband and possibly her children for insurance. Over 40 victims were found on the property. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
On April 28, 1908, her farmhouse burned down. Four bodies were found — including a decapitated woman. Many believed she staged the fire and escaped. Farmhand Ray Lamphere was convicted of arson. Numerous dismembered bodies were found in excavation. [^3]
