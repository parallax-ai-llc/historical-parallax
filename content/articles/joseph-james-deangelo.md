## Summary
Joseph James DeAngelo, the 'Golden State Killer' (also known as the East Area Rapist and Original Night Stalker), was a former police officer who committed at least 13 murders and 50 rapes across California between 1974 and 1986. He was identified in 2018 through genetic genealogy — a groundbreaking use of forensic technology.

## Early Life
Born November 8, 1945, in Bath, New York. He served in the Navy during Vietnam. He was a police officer in Exeter and Auburn, California, from 1973 to 1979, when he was fired for shoplifting. He later worked as a mechanic. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1974 and 1986, DeAngelo committed at least 50 rapes and 13 murders across California, initially as the 'East Area Rapist' in Sacramento and then as the 'Original Night Stalker' in Southern California. He broke into homes at night, binding couples and raping women while threatening to kill their partners. He was a serving police officer during many of the crimes. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
DeAngelo was identified in April 2018 through genetic genealogy, matching crime scene DNA to a distant relative in a public genealogy database (GEDmatch). He was arrested at his home in Citrus Heights on April 24, 2018. In June 2020, he pleaded guilty to 13 murders and 13 kidnappings. He was sentenced to life without parole. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His identification through genetic genealogy revolutionized cold case investigation worldwide [^4]
- Provided closure to victims' families after decades
- Demonstrated that advances in technology can solve seemingly unsolvable cases

## Negative Perspectives
