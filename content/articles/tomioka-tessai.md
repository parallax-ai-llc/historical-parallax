## Summary

Tomioka Tessai was the last major artist of the Bunjinga (literati painting) tradition in Japan and is considered a bridge between traditional and modern Japanese art. His bold, expressive brushwork and vivid colors, drawing on Chinese literary painting and Japanese sensibility, influenced modern Nihonga. He produced an enormous body of work across his 87 years.
