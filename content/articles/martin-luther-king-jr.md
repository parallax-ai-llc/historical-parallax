## Summary

Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) was an American Baptist minister and civil rights leader who became the most prominent spokesperson and leader of the American civil rights movement from 1955 until his assassination in 1968. Through nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, King advanced civil rights for African Americans and other marginalized groups. His leadership was fundamental to the movement's success in ending legal segregation of African Americans in the South and other parts of the United States. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 and is remembered for his "I Have a Dream" speech delivered during the 1963 March on Washington. His assassination in Memphis made him a martyr for the cause.
