## Summary

"Kot Kòb Petwo Karibe a?"—Where is the PetroCaribe money? This question, chanted in the streets of Port-au-Prince and spread through the hashtag #PetroCaribeChallenge, became the rallying cry of Haitian protests that paralyzed the country from 2018 into 2019. Haiti had received billions of dollars through Venezuela's subsidized oil program. It was meant to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Instead, it disappeared into a web of corruption reaching the highest levels of government—including President Jovenel Moïse.[^1]

The protests began in July 2018 when the government tried to raise fuel prices. But they quickly transformed into something larger: a reckoning with decades of corruption, foreign intervention, and the failure of the state to provide even the most basic services. By 2019, Haiti was in "peyi lok" (country lockdown), with barricades blocking roads, schools closed for months, and shortages of everything from fuel to food.[^2]

The protests did not remove Moïse, who clung to power until his assassination in July 2021. They did not recover the PetroCaribe billions. But they revealed the depth of Haitian anger and the bankruptcy of the political class. What followed—gang warfare, state collapse, and unprecedented crisis—built directly on the failures that the PetroCaribe movement exposed.[^3]

## Aftermath

### Moïse's Survival

- Opposition fragmented

### 2020-2021: Escalation to Collapse

- Moïse ruled by decree
- Gang power grew
- Kidnappings epidemic
- Economy collapsed further

**July 7, 2021:**

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did Protests Fail?

**No unified leadership:**

- Multiple opposition factions
- No agreed alternative

**Institutional collapse:**

- No parliament
- Courts compromised
- No constitutional path

**Gang dimension:**

- Armed groups complicated picture
- Some aligned with government
- Some with opposition
- Violence muddied moral clarity

**International support for Moïse:**

- US backed him until assassination
- No external pressure for change

### What Did They Reveal?

**Corruption's scale:**

- Billions stolen across administrations
- Foreign aid didn't reach people
- State captured by elites

**Haitian capacity for mobilization:**

- Movement was genuinely popular
- Young Haitians connected to diaspora
- Social media crucial

**But mobilization ≠ victory without institutions.**[^9]

## Legacy

### For Haiti

- PetroCaribe = symbol of betrayal
- Showed depth of corruption
- Preceded complete state collapse
- August 2024: Gang-government replacement

### For the World

- Example of how protests can't fix collapsed states
- Oil diplomacy's dark side (Venezuela)
- International community's failures

### "Kot Kòb?"

**The question remains:**

- Money never recovered
- Some officials later sanctioned (Canada, US)
- No Haitian accountability
- Future unknown[^10]
