## Summary

Saul Perlmutter is an American astrophysicist who shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. He led the Supernova Cosmology Project, which observed distant Type Ia supernovae and demonstrated that the universe's expansion is speeding up, implying the existence of dark energy. This discovery was called the most surprising in physics in decades.
