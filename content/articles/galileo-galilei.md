## Summary

Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist, and mathematician who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. Often called the "father of modern science," Galileo pioneered the scientific method combining mathematics with experimentation. He improved the telescope and made groundbreaking astronomical observations supporting Copernican heliocentrism (Earth orbits the Sun, not vice versa). His discoveries—Jupiter's moons, Venus's phases, Saturn's rings, lunar mountains, sunspots—revolutionized astronomy. In physics, he formulated laws of motion and falling bodies. His advocacy of heliocentrism brought him into conflict with the Catholic Church, leading to his trial by the Inquisition (1633) and house arrest for his final years. Galileo's work laid foundations for Newton's mechanics and modern astronomy.

## Early Life

Born February 15, 1564, in Pisa (Grand Duchy of Tuscany) to Vincenzo Galilei (musician, music theorist) and Giulia Ammannati. Eldest of six children in a minor noble family facing financial difficulties.

Educated at monastery in Vallombrosa, then enrolled at University of Pisa (1580) to study medicine. Became fascinated with mathematics and physics instead. Left without degree (1585) but continued studying Euclid and Archimedes independently.

In 1589, appointed professor of mathematics at University of Pisa despite lacking credentials, through family connections.

## Scientific Work

### Laws of Motion

**Falling Bodies:**
Tradition claims Galileo dropped objects from Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that different weights fall at same rate (likely apocryphal). He did conduct inclined plane experiments proving:
- Objects accelerate uniformly regardless of mass (in vacuum)
- Distance fallen proportional to square of time
- Contradicted Aristotelian physics (heavy objects fall faster)

**Pendulum:**
Discovered pendulum's isochronism (period independent of amplitude), leading to pendulum clocks.

**Projectile Motion:**
Showed projectiles follow parabolic paths, combining horizontal and vertical motion.

### The Telescope

In 1609, hearing of Dutch spyglasses, Galileo built his own telescope, improving magnification from 3x to 20x, then 30x. He turned it skyward—first European to systematically observe heavens with telescope.

**Revolutionary Discoveries (1609-1610):**

1. **Moon's Mountains and Craters:**
   - Moon has rough surface, not perfect sphere
   - Challenged Aristotelian perfect heavens

2. **Jupiter's Four Moons** (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto):
   - Proved not everything orbits Earth
   - Published in *Sidereus Nuncius* (Starry Messenger, 1610)
   - Named "Medicean stars" to flatter Medici patrons

3. **Venus's Phases:**
   - Venus shows phases like Moon
   - Only possible if Venus orbits Sun
   - Strong evidence for heliocentrism

4. **Saturn's "Ears":**
   - First saw Saturn's rings (thought they were moons or "handles")
   - Telescope wasn't powerful enough to resolve rings clearly

5. **Sunspots:**
   - Observed dark spots on Sun
   - Showed Sun rotates
   - Sun imperfect (challenged dogma)

6. **Milky Way:**
   - Resolved into countless individual stars
   - Universe far larger than imagined

### Copernican Controversy

**Heliocentrism:**
Copernicus proposed (1543) that Earth orbits Sun, not vice versa. Most scholars rejected this as contradicting:
- Common sense (we don't feel motion)
- Aristotelian physics
- Biblical passages (Joshua 10:13—Sun stood still)

Galileo's telescopic observations convinced him Copernicus was right. He began advocating publicly.

## Conflict with the Church

### First Warning (1616)

**The Issue:**
Catholic Church defended geocentrism (Earth center of universe) as biblical truth. Protestant Reformation had made Church sensitive to challenges to scriptural authority.

In 1616, Cardinal Bellarmine warned Galileo:
- Don't teach heliocentrism as fact
- Can discuss as mathematical hypothesis
- Copernicus's *De Revolutionibus* placed on Index of Forbidden Books "until corrected"

Galileo acquiesced but continued research.

### *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems* (1632)

Believing he had permission from Pope Urban VIII (former friend), Galileo published *Dialogue* in Italian (not Latin), making it accessible to wider audience.

**Format:**
- Three-person dialogue over four days
- Salviati (Copernican)
- Simplicio (Aristotelian)—name means "simpleton"
- Sagredo (neutral arbitrator)

**Problem:**
- Clearly favored Copernican view
- Made Simplicio look foolish
- Simplicio supposedly mouthed Pope's own arguments
- Pope felt ridiculed

### Trial by Inquisition (1633)

Summoned to Rome, Galileo faced the Inquisition on charges of heresy.

**The Trial:**
- Age 68, ill, threatened with torture
- Charged with violating 1616 injunction
- Offered plea: abjure heliocentrism

**Sentence (June 22, 1633):**
- Found "vehemently suspect of heresy"
- Forced to recant heliocentrism publicly
- *Dialogue* banned
- House arrest for life
- Daily penitential psalms

**The Recantation:**
Kneeling, Galileo read:
> "I abjure, curse, and detest the aforesaid errors and heresies... I swear that in future I will never again say or assert... anything that might cause similar suspicion."

**Legend:**
After recanting, Galileo supposedly muttered "Eppur si muove" ("And yet it moves"—Earth still orbits Sun). Almost certainly false but captures defiant spirit.

## House Arrest and Final Years

Confined to his villa in Arcetri near Florence under house arrest. Prohibited from publishing or teaching.

Despite this:
- Worked on physics and mechanics
- Wrote *Two New Sciences* (1638), his final book on motion and strength of materials
- Published in Protestant Netherlands (beyond Church's reach)
- Went blind (1638)—possibly from observing Sun
- Continued dictating ideas to students

**Visitors:**
- John Milton (1638) visited, later referenced Galileo in *Paradise Lost*
- Thomas Hobbes corresponded
- Students smuggled manuscripts out

**Death:**
Died January 8, 1642, age 77, at Arcetri. Buried in small chapel in Santa Croce. Not given honorable tomb until 1737.

Ironically, Newton was born same year Galileo died (1642).

## Legacy

### Scientific Impact

**Astronomy:**
- Destroyed Aristotelian cosmology
- Established observational astronomy
- Proved Copernican heliocentrism correct

**Physics:**
- Laws of falling bodies
- Principle of inertia (precursor to Newton's First Law)
- Principle of relativity (motion is relative)
- Founded experimental physics

**Scientific Method:**
- Combined mathematics with experiment
- Emphasized empirical evidence over authority
- Reproducible experiments

**Quote:**
> "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe."

### Church Rehabilitation

Catholic Church slowly admitted error:
- 1741: Permission to publish Galileo's complete works
- 1758: Removed ban on heliocentric books
- 1992: Pope John Paul II officially acknowledged Church's error in condemning Galileo
- 2008: Vatican planned statue of Galileo (not completed)

### Cultural Icon

Galileo symbolizes:
- Science vs. religious dogma
- Truth vs. authority
- Courage despite persecution
- Intellectual freedom

Frequently cited in debates over science, religion, and academic freedom.

## Famous Quotes

> "All truths are easy to understand once they are discovered; the point is to discover them."

> "You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him discover it in himself."

> "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use."

> "Mathematics is the language in which God has written the universe."

> "Wine is sunlight, held together by water."
