## Summary

Attila (c. 406-453 CE), known as "the Scourge of God" (Flagellum Dei), was the ruler of the Hunnic Empire and one of the most feared enemies of the Roman Empire. Leading a vast confederation of nomadic peoples from the steppes, Attila repeatedly invaded the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, extracting massive tribute payments and devastating large territories. His failed invasion of Gaul (451 CE), halted at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, and aborted invasion of Italy (452 CE) marked the limits of Hunnic power. Attila's sudden death ended the Hunnic threat, but his name became synonymous with barbaric destruction.

## The Huns

**Origins:**
Nomadic people from Central Asian steppes. Possibly related to Xiongnu who fought China.

**Migration:**
Pushed westward (4th-5th centuries). Displaced Germanic tribes, who then invaded Roman Empire (Visigoths, Vandals, etc.).

**Society:**
- Pastoral nomads
- Expert horsemen and archers
- Mobile, fast-moving armies
- Confederation of various peoples under Hunnic leadership

---

## Rise to Power

**Co-Rule with Bleda (434-445 CE):**
Attila and brother Bleda jointly ruled Hunnic Empire. Inherited from uncles Octar and Ruga.

**Treaty with Eastern Rome:**
Extracted tribute (700 pounds of gold annually).

**Bleda's Death (445 CE):**
Attila became sole ruler. Bleda possibly murdered by Attila.

---

## Eastern Campaigns

**Invasions of Eastern Roman Empire (440s):**
- Repeatedly crossed Danube
- Sacked cities in Balkans
- Defeated Roman armies
- Threatened Constantinople
- Eastern Empire paid increasingly massive tributes (2,100 pounds gold annually)

**Purpose:**
Wealth extraction, not permanent conquest.

---

## Invasion of Gaul (451 CE)

**Pretext:**
Dispute over Honoria (Western Emperor's sister, who allegedly proposed marriage to Attila).

**Campaign:**
Invaded Gaul with massive army (estimates vary wildly).

**Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (June 451):**
- Roman general Aetius allied with Visigoths
- Massive battle, inconclusive but Attila withdrew
- One of history's largest battles
- Checked Hunnic expansion westward

---

## Invasion of Italy (452 CE)

**Advance:**
Crossed into Italy. Destroyed Aquileia (refugees founded Venice). Ravaged northern Italy.

**Withdrawal:**
- Met with Pope Leo I
- Legend: Pope persuaded Attila to withdraw (divine intervention?)
- Reality: Likely combination of plague in army, famine, and Eastern Roman forces threatening
- Retreated without attacking Rome

---

## Death (453 CE)

**Wedding Night:**
Married Ildico (Germanic princess). Found dead next morning.

**Cause:**
Officially: Nosebleed/hemorrhage (possibly from excessive drinking). Some suspected poisoning by new wife.

**Aftermath:**
Sons fought each other. Subject peoples rebelled. Hunnic Empire collapsed within generation.

---

## Reputation

**"Scourge of God":**
Christian Romans saw him as divine punishment for sins.

**Terror:**
Name became synonymous with destruction. "Attila" passed into legend.

**Reassessment:**
Modern scholars note he was effective ruler, diplomat as well as warrior. Employed Romans, maintained complex court.

**Germanic Legend:**
Appears in Norse sagas and German Nibelungenlied as "Etzel"/"Atli."

---

## Legacy

**Historical:**
- Weakened Roman Empire
- Contributed to Western Rome's fall (476 CE)
- Demonstrated vulnerability of "eternal" Rome

**Cultural:**
- Archetype of barbarian conqueror
- "Hun" became generic term for barbaric invader (WWI Germans)
- Countless modern depictions
