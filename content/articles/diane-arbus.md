## Summary

Diane Arbus was an American photographer known for her portraits of people on the margins of society including giants, dwarfs, transgender people, and nudists. Her direct, confrontational style challenged conventions of beauty and normalcy in photography. Her posthumous retrospective at MoMA in 1972 was the most attended photography exhibition in history.
