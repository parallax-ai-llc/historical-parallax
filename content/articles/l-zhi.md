## Summary

Lü Zhi (呂雉, 241 BC – 18 August 180 BC), courtesy name E'xu, commonly known as Empress Lü and formally Empress Gao of Han, was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China and wield paramount power.[^1] As empress consort to Emperor Gaozu, the founding emperor of the Han dynasty, and later as empress dowager and regent, she dominated Chinese politics for over two decades, establishing precedents for female political power that would resonate throughout imperial Chinese history.[^2] Her reign was marked by administrative competence and economic recovery, yet also by ruthless political purges and acts of legendary cruelty.[^3] She remains one of the most controversial figures in Chinese history, admired for her political acumen yet condemned for her brutality.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Lü Zhi was born in 241 BC in Shanfu, located in present-day Shan County, Shandong Province, during the waning years of the Qin dynasty.[^5] Her father, Lü Wen (also known as Lü Gong), came from a noble family and relocated the household to Pei County in Jiangsu Province to escape a personal enemy.[^6] This fateful move would position the Lü family at the center of the rebellion that would topple the Qin dynasty and establish the Han.

Lü Zhi grew up in a household that valued education and social advancement. Her father possessed skills in prosopomancy, the art of fortune-telling by reading facial features, which would prove instrumental in shaping his daughter's destiny.[^7] She had several siblings, including an older sister Lü Changxu, an older brother Lü Ze, and a younger sister Lü Xu who would later marry the prominent general Fan Kuai.[^8]

The defining moment of Lü Zhi's early life came at a banquet hosted by her father in Pei County. Many influential men attended, and Xiao He, a local official, announced that guests offering less than 1,000 coins would be seated outside the main hall.[^9] Liu Bang, then a low-ranking pavilion chief, arrived with barely a single cent but brazenly declared "I offer 10,000 coins."[^10] Rather than being offended by this obvious lie, Lü Wen was captivated by Liu Bang's appearance and demeanor. According to historical accounts, he told Liu Bang, "I used to predict fortunes for many people but I've never seen someone so exceptional like you before," and immediately offered his daughter's hand in marriage.[^11]

This arrangement puzzled and angered Lü Zhi's mother, who objected to marrying their daughter to a man of such low status and questionable character.[^12] Nevertheless, Lü Wen's decision proved prophetic. Lü Zhi married Liu Bang and bore him a daughter (who would become Princess Yuan of Lu) and a son, Liu Ying (the future Emperor Hui of Han).[^13] During these early years of marriage, Lü Zhi embraced domestic life, managing farmland and raising children during Liu Bang's frequent absences.[^14] She carried infants in baskets while tilling soil, embodying the Confucian ideal of spousal support—a devoted wife far removed from her later fearsome reputation.[^15]

---

## Rise to Power

The trajectory of Lü Zhi's life changed dramatically when Liu Bang joined the rebellion against the Qin dynasty in 209 BC. As Liu Bang participated in military campaigns under the insurgent Chu kingdom alongside the prominent warlord Xiang Yu, Lü Zhi and her children remained behind in Pei County.[^16] This period tested her resilience and resourcefulness as she managed the household alone during years of warfare and uncertainty.

The Chu-Han Contention (206-202 BC) brought Lü Zhi her greatest trial. In the summer of 205 BC, during the four-year power struggle between Liu Bang and Xiang Yu for supremacy over China, she and Liu Bang's father were captured by Xiang Yu's forces and taken hostage.[^17] Xiang Yu, seeking leverage over his rival, threatened to cook Liu Bang's father alive.[^18] Liu Bang's response revealed the brutal pragmatism of the era—he feigned indifference, reportedly offering to share in the resulting soup.[^19] Lü Zhi remained a captive for two years until the autumn of 203 BC, when the Treaty of Hong Canal secured her release along with other members of Liu Bang's family.[^20]

This captivity profoundly shaped Lü Zhi's political consciousness. She had witnessed firsthand how women and family members became pawns in struggles for power, and she understood that in an era when deposed consorts faced death or slavery, survival required strength and ruthlessness.[^21] When she returned to Liu Bang's side, she was no longer merely a supportive wife but a hardened survivor with acute political awareness.

After Liu Bang's forces defeated Xiang Yu at the Battle of Gaixia in 202 BC, he proclaimed himself Emperor of China and established the Han dynasty.[^22] Liu Bang instated Lü Zhi as his empress and their son Liu Ying as crown prince.[^23] As empress, Lü Zhi quickly proved herself a capable administrator, often managing state affairs at the capital Chang'an (modern-day Xi'an) while Emperor Gaozu campaigned against rebellious kings.[^24] She established strong working relationships with many of Gaozu's officials, who admired her capability and feared her ruthlessness.[^25]

The most significant threat to Lü Zhi's position came in Emperor Gaozu's later years when he began favoring Consort Qi, a beautiful concubine who bore him a son named Liu Ruyi.[^26] The emperor believed Liu Ruyi possessed stronger character than the gentle Liu Ying and repeatedly attempted to replace Liu Ying as crown prince.[^27] Only through political maneuvering did Lü Zhi secure her son's position. Following strategist Zhang Liang's advice, she secured the support of the "Four Haos of Mount Shang"—reclusive scholars whose endorsement solidified Liu Ying's position as heir.[^28] This episode revealed Lü's mastery of soft power: where brute force might fail, cultural capital prevailed.[^29]

## Major Achievements

When Emperor Gaozu died in June 195 BC, Liu Ying succeeded to the throne as Emperor Hui of Han, and Lü Zhi was honored as empress dowager.[^30] She exerted more influence during her son's reign than she had as empress, becoming the powerful and effective lead figure in his administration.[^31] After Emperor Hui's death in 188 BC, Lü Zhi became grand empress dowager and regent, choosing his successor from among his sons with other consorts.[^32] She first placed Emperor Qianshao on the throne (r. 188-184 BC), then removed him for another puppet ruler, Emperor Houshao (r. 184-180 BC).[^33]

The official histories of the Han dynasty—the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian) by Sima Qian and the Hanshu (Book of Han) by Ban Gu—fully acknowledged the regency of Empress Dowager Lü as a period of rule rather than as that of the two infant emperors.[^34] Both histories granted Empress Lü her own imperial biography in their "Basic Annals" sections, typically reserved for emperors, making her one of only two women in Chinese history to receive this honor (the other being Empress Wu Zetian).[^35] She addressed herself as "Zhèn" (朕), a first-person pronoun reserved for the emperor after the Qin dynasty, and officials addressed her as "Imperial Majesty" (陛下; Bìxià), an honorific used when addressing the emperor directly.[^36]

Lü Zhi's fifteen-year regency brought stability and prosperity to China after decades of war. She proved to be a competent regent who relaxed taxes and abolished the most cruel penalties of the Qin dynasty's penal law.[^37] During her reign, the empire recovered from the hardships of decades of warfare and exploitation.[^38] Her policies had a positive effect on the country as she improved conditions for the poor, rebuilt sections of the Great Wall, and increased state revenue.[^39]

Lü Zhi adopted the Huang-Lao method of "ruling by doing nothing" (wuwei), emphasizing policies that gave respite to the people.[^40] She encouraged citizens to collect and donate books, helping restore many classical texts that had been destroyed during the Qin dynasty's book burnings.[^41] Historian Sima Qian noted in the Records of the Grand Historian: "During Emperor Hui and Empress Lü's rule, the people finally escaped the Warring States' suffering."[^42] This series of measures laid a solid foundation for the later reigns of Emperor Wen and Emperor Jing, whose combined rule became known as the "Rule of Wen and Jing," one of the most prosperous periods in Han history.[^43]

In economic policy, Empress Lü made significant reforms. In 186 BC, she abolished private minting of currency, establishing government monopoly over coin production.[^44] She first issued a government-minted bronze coin weighing 5.7 grams, but in 182 BC issued a lighter coin weighing 1.5 grams.[^45] While the lighter coin caused widespread inflation and was later reversed, these reforms demonstrated her willingness to experiment with economic policy.[^46]

Lü Zhi also established precedents for political marriages and regency models that subsequent dynasties referenced when empress dowagers governed during minority reigns.[^47] She demonstrated that women in elite families could wield significant political power and govern effectively.[^48] Her practical governance brought stability and economic recovery after years of war, establishing patterns of female regency that would persist throughout Chinese imperial history.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite her administrative accomplishments, Lü Zhi's reign was marked by acts of extreme cruelty that have dominated her historical reputation. The most infamous incident involved her treatment of Consort Qi, Emperor Gaozu's favorite concubine and the mother of Liu Ruyi, Prince of Zhao.[^50] Because of Consort Qi's attempts to have her son replace Liu Ying as crown prince, Lü Zhi harbored deep hatred for both mother and son.[^51]

After Emperor Gaozu's death, Lü Zhi moved swiftly against her rivals. She had Liu Ruyi poisoned despite her own son Emperor Hui's attempts to protect his half-brother.[^52] Her revenge against Consort Qi exceeded even the brutal standards of the era. According to historical accounts, Lü Zhi had Consort Qi's hands and feet chopped off, eyes gouged out, ears burned, nose sliced off, and tongue cut out.[^53] She forced Consort Qi to drink a potion that made her mute and had her thrown into a latrine, calling her a "human swine" (人彘).[^54]

Several days later, Emperor Hui was taken to view the "human swine" and was shocked to learn it was Consort Qi.[^55] He cried loudly and became ill for a long time, telling his mother: "This is something done not by a human. As the empress dowager's son, I'll never be able to rule the empire."[^56] From that point, Emperor Hui indulged himself in carnal pleasures and ignored state affairs, leaving all governance to his mother.[^57] This traumatic incident effectively broke Emperor Hui's spirit and gave Lü Zhi complete control over the government.

Lü Zhi's rule was characterized by systematic elimination of perceived threats. As the widow of the dynasty's founder, she leveraged her position to eliminate three key groups: Liu Bang's other sons by concubines, influential military commanders, and political rivals who might challenge her authority.[^58] She reportedly had a keen instinct for knowing which disaffected nobles could cause potential problems for her family and was ruthless enough to have several of these threats eliminated, sometimes without consulting Emperor Gaozu during his lifetime.[^59]

During her regency, Lü Zhi elevated members of her natal Lü clan to commanding military and administrative posts while sidelining Liu family princes.[^60] She manipulated the throne by installing young relatives as puppet emperors and put her nephews Lü Lu and Lü Chan in charge of the imperial guards immediately before her death.[^61] This consolidation of power in her clan's hands created resentment among Liu family princes and senior officials, setting the stage for violent retribution after her death.

Some scholars note that while Lü Zhi's cruelties are well-documented, most information comes from sources whose accuracy might be questionable and authors known for hyperbole.[^62] Her rival Consort Qi was used to symbolize the supposed dangers of women in power, and the "human swine" story may have been exaggerated as a rhetorical tool.[^63] Nevertheless, even accounting for possible exaggeration, the historical consensus confirms that Lü Zhi employed brutal methods to maintain power.

---

## Personal Life

Lü Zhi's personal life was shaped by the tumultuous political landscape in which she lived. Her marriage to Liu Bang produced two children: Princess Yuan of Lu and Liu Ying (Emperor Hui).[^64] Her relationship with Liu Bang evolved from devoted wife to political partner, though his later favoritism toward Consort Qi created a permanent rift that would have deadly consequences.[^65]

As a mother, Lü Zhi was fiercely protective of her children's interests, though her methods traumatized her son Emperor Hui. He was described as personally kind, well-intentioned, simple, hesitant, soft-hearted, and generous—unable to escape the impact of his mother's viciousness.[^66] After witnessing his mother's treatment of Consort Qi, Emperor Hui told her he could not govern the empire given that he was the son of someone who had done such inhuman deeds.[^67] From that point, he only "indulged himself with wine and women" and no longer made major governing decisions.[^68] This broken relationship between mother and son revealed the personal cost of Lü Zhi's political ruthlessness.

Lü Zhi arranged politically advantageous marriages within her family. She married her daughter Princess Yuan to Zhang Ao, who succeeded his father as ruler of Zhao in 204 BC.[^69] Later, she arranged for Princess Yuan's daughter Zhang Yan to marry Emperor Hui—an uncle-niece marriage that strengthened Lü Zhi's control over the imperial household.[^70] These marriage arrangements demonstrated her strategic use of family relationships to consolidate power.

Historical sources describe Lü Zhi's personality as complex and multifaceted. She demonstrated extraordinary political acumen, administrative competence, and strategic intelligence.[^71] Officials both admired her capability and feared her ruthlessness.[^72] In her final years, there are hints of reflection and perhaps remorse. She reportedly told an advisor named Shen: "Killing many brings retribution; it comes late in life but always arrives."[^73] This symbolic gesture of awareness revealed her growing consciousness of mortality and possibly buried guilt.[^74]

Lü Zhi's transformation from a peasant wife tilling soil with infants in tow to China's first female ruler demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability.[^75] Her early period revealed a capable, devoted woman who embodied Confucian ideals of spousal support.[^76] The years of war, captivity, and political struggle hardened her into a ruthless survivor willing to employ any means necessary to protect her position and her son's throne.

## Legacy

Lü Zhi died of illness at the age of 61 on 18 August 180 BC.[^77] She was originally entombed with her husband Emperor Gaozu.[^78] However, her death triggered immediate political upheaval. Within days, a coalition of high ministers and disgruntled princes of the imperial Liu family orchestrated a coup against the Lü clan.[^79] Chancellor Chen Ping and Grand Commandant Zhou Bo, leveraging their control over the palace guard and northern army, arrested and executed key Lü figures such as Lü Chan and Lü Lu.[^80] The entire Lü clan was exterminated in a bloody purge known as the Lü Clan Disturbance, and Emperor Houshao was deposed in favor of Emperor Wen, marking a restoration of Liu family authority.[^81]

Interestingly, some advisors apparently felt that the massacre of the Lü clan was without cause, suggesting that contemporary opinions varied on whether the purge was justified.[^82] Nevertheless, after Empress Lü's death, her efforts on behalf of the Lü clan came to nothing—her entire extended family was destroyed within weeks.[^83]

Lü Zhi's historical legacy is deeply contested. She set significant precedents as China's first woman to assume the title Empress and wield paramount power.[^84] She demonstrated that women could hold real power in a male-dominated imperial system, influencing later figures like Empress Wu Zetian.[^85] Her fifteen-year regency brought economic recovery and political stability, establishing administrative patterns that benefited subsequent Han rulers.[^86]

However, traditional Chinese historiography has been harsh in its judgment of Lü Zhi. Chinese historiographers always quarreled about whether Empress Lü should be listed among the rulers of the Han dynasty as having ruled (and not just reigned).[^87] The replacement of Empress Lü by the two child emperors in some historiographical traditions resulted from orthodox Confucian thought flourishing during the Song period (960-1279) that did not allow a woman to rule.[^88]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars increasingly offer nuanced perspectives on Lü Zhi that challenge traditional condemnations. Historian Sima Qian, writing in the Shiji, presented Empress Lü as a woman who brought peace to the world after the tumultuous period of the Warring States.[^89] For Sima Qian, the main feature dominating Lü's life was fear for herself and her clan, and he portrayed the battle between the Lü family and the Liu princes as one between two equal competitors.[^90] This interpretation suggests her actions stemmed from survival instinct rather than pure malice.

Contemporary scholars emphasize Lü Zhi's administrative competence and the Han dynasty stability during her fifteen-year regency, which contradicts narratives of pure tyranny.[^91] They note that her practical governance brought stability and economic recovery after years of war.[^92] Her adoption of Huang-Lao philosophy and light-handed governance created conditions for the later prosperity of the "Rule of Wen and Jing."[^93]

Some feminist scholars view Lü Zhi as China's first female sovereign who navigated patriarchal systems with extraordinary skill.[^94] In an era when women had limited options for power, she broke gender barriers and demonstrated that women could govern effectively.[^95] Her willingness to use political marriages, cultural capital, and administrative reforms showed sophisticated understanding of power dynamics.[^96]

Scholars also note that in the brutal context of early imperial China, where succession disputes routinely resulted in mass executions, Lü Zhi's methods were not unprecedented.[^97] The same actions that earned male rulers praise as "decisive" branded her as "ruthless," highlighting enduring double standards in historical assessment.[^98] Her cruelties, while extreme, reflected systemic brutality rather than unique malice.[^99]

### Negative Views

Traditional histories overwhelmingly portray Lü Zhi as a scheming, bloodthirsty woman violating Confucian gender norms.[^100] Ban Gu, author of the Hanshu, attributed her actions to naked cruelty, and for him the struggle was between the legitimate dynasty and a family who had wrongfully usurped power.[^101] Because Ban Gu changed the account of Sima Qian in subtle ways, his image of Empress Lü became more influential than Sima Qian's original version.[^102] This more negative portrayal dominated traditional Chinese historiography for centuries.

Critics emphasize the extraordinary brutality of her treatment of Consort Qi, which shocked even her own son and caused him to withdraw from governance.[^103] They argue that her systematic elimination of Liu family princes and consolidation of power in the Lü clan demonstrated naked ambition rather than defensive necessity.[^104] The swift and total destruction of the Lü clan after her death is sometimes interpreted as evidence that her rule was tyrannical and illegitimate.[^105]

Confucian scholars particularly condemned Lü Zhi for violating gender norms by exercising direct political power rather than remaining in the domestic sphere.[^106] Her assumption of imperial titles and honorifics traditionally reserved for male emperors was seen as transgressive.[^107] Traditional historiography remembers her primarily for her cruelties rather than her administrative accomplishments.[^108]

Some historians argue that Lü Zhi's cruelties and political purges weakened the early Han dynasty and created instability, even if her economic policies were beneficial.[^109] They suggest that her manipulation of the throne and installation of puppet emperors undermined imperial legitimacy and set dangerous precedents.[^110]
