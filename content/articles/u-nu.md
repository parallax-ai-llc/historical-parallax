## Summary

U Nu (May 25, 1907 – February 14, 1995), also known as Thakin Nu, was Burma's first Prime Minister following independence from Britain in 1948. A deeply religious Buddhist and skilled politician, U Nu led Burma through its formative democratic years, implementing ambitious welfare state policies while navigating ethnic insurgencies, economic challenges, and Cold War geopolitics. His tenure ended with military coups in 1958 and 1962, the latter leading to decades of military dictatorship. Despite his failures to resolve ethnic conflicts and economic crises, U Nu remains respected for his integrity, democratic ideals, and commitment to Buddhist principles in governance.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

U Nu was born on May 25, 1907, in Wakema, a small town in the Irrawaddy Delta region of British Burma, to U San Tun and Daw Saw Khin.[^4] His father was a minor nationalist politician who actively participated in the local chapters of the Young Men's Buddhist Association (YMBA) and later in the General Council of Buddhist Associations (GCBA), which exposed young U Nu to anti-colonial sentiment from an early age.[^5] The family operated a small shop in Wakema, placing them in the lower middle-class stratum of colonial Burmese society.

U Nu received his early education in Wakema before moving to Rangoon (Yangon) to attend Myoma National High School, one of the premier educational institutions for young Burmese nationalists.[^6] He excelled academically and in 1929 graduated from the University of Rangoon with a Bachelor of Arts degree.[^7] After graduation, Nu spent five years working as a teacher and journalist, gaining valuable experience in communication and understanding the concerns of ordinary Burmese people. During this period, he developed his writing skills and began to engage more deeply with nationalist ideas circulating among educated Burmese.

In 1934, U Nu returned to Rangoon University to pursue a law degree, a decision that would prove pivotal to his political career.[^8] At university, he formed a close friendship with U Thant, who would later become Secretary-General of the United Nations. More importantly, U Nu became deeply involved in student politics and the growing nationalist movement against British colonial rule. The university environment in the 1930s was a hotbed of anti-colonial activism, and U Nu found himself at the center of this ferment.

U Nu first gained national prominence as one of the leaders of the historic 1936 student strike at Rangoon University.[^9] The strike, which began as a protest against university policies, quickly evolved into one of the first mass demonstrations of Burmese opposition to British colonial authority. U Nu's expulsion from the university, along with that of his colleague Aung San (father of Aung San Suu Kyi), transformed both men into nationalist heroes and thrust them into leadership positions in the independence movement. Like many of his contemporaries in the nationalist movement, Nu adopted the honorific title "Thakin" (Master), a term traditionally used by Burmese when addressing British colonizers, as an assertion of Burmese dignity and resistance to colonial subordination.[^10]

In 1935, while still pursuing his law degree, U Nu married Mya Yi, establishing a family life that would endure through the tumultuous decades ahead.[^11] His early life experiences—from his father's nationalist activism to his education at elite institutions and his participation in the student movement—shaped U Nu's political philosophy, which would blend Buddhist principles, socialist economics, and democratic ideals in a uniquely Burmese synthesis.

## Rise to Power

U Nu's ascent to political leadership accelerated during World War II and its immediate aftermath. He became an active member of the Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association), a nationalist organization that promoted Burmese cultural identity and independence.[^12] During the Japanese occupation of Burma (1942-1945), U Nu, like many nationalist leaders, initially cooperated with the Japanese, who had promised Burmese independence. He served in various administrative roles under the Japanese-sponsored government, though he became increasingly disillusioned with Japanese militarism and their failure to grant genuine independence.

The critical turning point came with the formation of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) in 1944, which brought together diverse political factions—communists, socialists, and other nationalists—in opposition to Japanese occupation.[^13] When the AFPFL switched sides and joined the Allies against Japan in March 1945, U Nu was among its leadership. This strategic move positioned the AFPFL as the legitimate voice of Burmese nationalism when the war ended.

The assassination of Aung San and six cabinet ministers on July 19, 1947, dramatically altered U Nu's trajectory.[^14] Aung San, who had been the charismatic leader of the independence movement and the architect of Burma's political future, was gunned down along with most of his cabinet by political rivals just months before independence. At this critical juncture, U Nu emerged as the leader capable of holding the fractious AFPFL coalition together. Despite lacking Aung San's military background and charismatic authority, U Nu possessed political skills, moral authority derived from his Buddhist devotion, and the trust of diverse factions.

In October 1947, U Nu led the AFPFL delegation in signing the Nu-Attlee Treaty with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, which finalized the terms of Burmese independence.[^15] When Burma gained independence on January 4, 1948, U Nu became the nation's first Prime Minister under the provisions of the 1947 Constitution of the Union of Burma.[^16] He was 40 years old and faced the monumental task of building a nation from the ruins of war, managing ethnic diversity, and establishing democratic institutions in a society with no previous experience of self-governance.

U Nu's rise was not that of a revolutionary firebrand but rather of a consensus builder and intellectual who found himself thrust into leadership by historical circumstance. His political philosophy, which he termed "Buddhist Socialism," sought to reconcile traditional Burmese Buddhist values with modern socialist economic policies and democratic governance.[^17] This ideological framework would define his tenure as Prime Minister, though it would also prove insufficient to resolve the deep structural challenges facing the new nation.

## Major Achievements

U Nu's tenure as Prime Minister was marked by several significant accomplishments that shaped modern Burma, despite the enormous challenges he faced in governing a war-torn, ethnically divided nation.

**Democratic Governance and Constitutional Framework**

One of U Nu's most important achievements was establishing and maintaining democratic governance during Burma's first decade of independence. He played a crucial role in drafting the 1947 Constitution of the Union of Burma, which created a parliamentary democracy with protections for minority rights.[^18] For over a decade, Burma held regular elections, maintained freedom of the press, and allowed political opposition—a stark contrast to most of its neighbors and to the military dictatorship that would follow. U Nu's commitment to democratic principles, even when they made governing more difficult, demonstrated genuine dedication to participatory governance.

**The Pyidawtha Plan: Economic Development and Welfare State**

U Nu's most ambitious domestic achievement was the Pyidawtha Plan, an eight-year national economic development program launched in 1952 to establish an industrial welfare state in Burma.[^19] The term "Pyidawtha" translates as "Royal Prosperous Country" or "Happy Land," reflecting U Nu's vision of combining economic development with Buddhist principles of collective welfare. In August 1951, the government contracted with American engineering firms to develop a comprehensive development program, resulting in an 800-page report completed in August 1953.[^20]

The Pyidawtha Plan was estimated to cost $1.575 billion (a massive sum for a developing nation), with two-thirds allocated to industrial enterprises and the remainder to social services.[^21] The plan focused heavily on infrastructure rehabilitation, as Burma's roads, railways, and industrial facilities had suffered extensive damage during World War II. U Nu and AFPFL leaders viewed this as more than an economic program—it was an attempt to create a "Buddhist welfare state" that would provide citizens with housing, education, healthcare, and economic security while removing the greed that Buddhism identified as a source of suffering.[^22]

Though the Pyidawtha Plan failed to meet its ambitious targets due to falling rice prices after the Korean War boom, it made significant headway in infrastructure development, agriculture, and industry.[^23] More importantly, it represented one of the first comprehensive economic development plans adopted by a post-colonial developing nation, serving as a model for other countries navigating independence.

**Buddhist Revival and International Leadership**

U Nu devoted considerable effort to reviving and promoting Buddhism both domestically and internationally. He built the Kaba Aye Pagoda and the Maha Pasana Guha (Great Cave) in Rangoon in preparation for the Sixth Buddhist Synod, which Burma hosted from 1954 to 1956 as prime minister.[^24] This gathering brought together Buddhist scholars and monks from around the world to revise and preserve Buddhist scriptures, positioning Burma as a center of Theravada Buddhism and U Nu as a global Buddhist leader.

**Non-Aligned Foreign Policy**

In foreign affairs, U Nu pursued a policy of neutrality during the Cold War, refusing to align Burma with either the Western bloc led by the United States or the Soviet Union.[^25] This independent foreign policy allowed Burma to maintain relationships with both sides while avoiding entanglement in great power conflicts. U Nu played a pivotal role in organizing the historic 1955 Bandung Conference in Indonesia, which brought together leaders from 29 Asian and African nations.[^26] The conference, co-sponsored by Burma, Indonesia, India, Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and Pakistan, laid the foundation for the Non-Aligned Movement that would shape international relations for decades.

U Nu's participation alongside leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Sukarno, and Zhou Enlai established him as a significant voice for newly independent nations seeking to chart their own course in international affairs.[^27] He advocated for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among nations with different political systems, famously stating about China-Burma relations: "If we practice these principles honestly with full sincerity in order to eradicate mistrust and suspicion, China and Burma will go down in history as the two countries which turned a world of turmoil, suspicion and distrust into a world of peace and contentment."[^28]

**Democratic Restoration in 1960**

Perhaps U Nu's most remarkable achievement came not during his initial tenure but in 1960, when he returned to power through democratic elections after voluntarily ceding authority to a military caretaker government. In 1960, General Ne Win, who had assumed power in 1958 at U Nu's invitation, honored his commitment to restore civilian rule by holding free and fair elections.[^29] U Nu campaigned on the platform of "democracy versus fascism" and won a massive victory, with 59 percent voter turnout—the highest in Burma's history.[^30] Ne Win handed power back to U Nu on April 4, 1960, in one of the rare instances where a military government voluntarily returned authority to civilian rule.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, U Nu's leadership faced severe criticism and ultimately failed to address the fundamental challenges threatening Burma's stability and unity.

**Governance Failures and Administrative Inefficiency**

Although U Nu was respected as a statesman, his government suffered from chronic administrative inefficiency and inability to effectively govern.[^31] Critics noted that while U Nu possessed moral authority and intellectual capability, he lacked the executive skills and decisiveness needed to manage a complex modern state. His consensus-building approach often resulted in paralysis when decisive action was required. Economic difficulties persisted throughout his tenure, with corruption becoming endemic in government administration despite U Nu's personal integrity.

**Inability to Control Insurgencies**

U Nu's government proved unable to suppress multiple insurgencies that threatened national integrity. Communist insurgents, ethnic minority armed groups—particularly the Karen National Union—and various other rebel factions controlled large swathes of territory.[^32] The government's inability to establish effective control over these regions undermined its legitimacy and created a permanent state of low-intensity civil war. Frustrated military commanders increasingly viewed the civilian government as incompetent and weak, setting the stage for eventual military intervention.

**Politicization of the Military**

U Nu made critical errors in civil-military relations that would have lasting consequences. He infuriated Burman commanders by arbitrarily promoting Karen officers to senior positions to maintain political support from Karen communities, rather than based on merit or military considerations.[^33] This politicization of military appointments undermined professional military culture and encouraged military leaders to view themselves as political actors rather than servants of civilian authority. These actions contributed to the military's willingness to intervene in politics, first in 1958 and decisively in 1962.

**Buddhist State Religion Controversy**

One of U Nu's most damaging decisions came in 1961 when he made Buddhism the state religion of Burma, breaking with the secular principles established by Aung San and enshrined in earlier constitutional discussions.[^34] U Nu had campaigned on this promise in the 1960 elections, viewing it as consistent with his Buddhist Socialist philosophy and responsive to the Buddhist majority's desires. However, this decision alienated Christian minorities, particularly the Kachin and Karen peoples, as well as Muslims and other religious communities. The elevation of Buddhism to state religion status became one of the main factors triggering the Kachin conflict and intensifying separatist sentiments among non-Buddhist ethnic groups.[^35]

**Failure to Address Ethnic Minorities and Federalism**

U Nu's government failed to honor the Panglong Agreement of 1947, in which Aung San had promised full autonomy for areas inhabited by ethnic minorities in exchange for their joining the Union of Burma.[^36] The central government did almost nothing to promote development in ethnic regions. In Shan State, central government troops sent to expel retreating Chinese Nationalist (KMT) forces abused the local Shan population, creating resentment against the Burman-dominated government.[^37]

As ethnic political leaders called for a more decentralized federal structure with a single Burman state and several ethnic states, each with equal powers, U Nu's response was inadequate.[^38] In 1961, Shan leaders, led by Sao Shwe Thaik (Burma's first president and saopha of Yawnghwe), proposed a federal system granting greater autonomy to ethnic states.[^39] Although the Shan had a constitutional right to secede from the Union after ten years, they promised not to exercise this right if federalism could accommodate their concerns.

The Burmese military, led by General Ne Win, viewed the federalism proposal as secessionist and a mortal threat to national unity.[^40] U Nu appeared willing to make concessions to ethnic minorities at the National Seminar on Federalism, which alarmed military leaders who feared the breakup of Burma. This fear became a primary justification for the 1962 coup that ended U Nu's government and Burma's democratic experiment.

**The 1962 Coup and Its Aftermath**

On March 2, 1962, General Ne Win led a swift military coup that overthrew U Nu's government.[^41] Unlike the 1958 intervention, which had U Nu's consent, the 1962 coup occurred without his approval and was genuinely hostile to civilian rule.[^42] While often described as "bloodless," the coup actually resulted in deaths, including that of Sao Mye Thaik, the 17-year-old son of former President Sao Shwe Thaik, who was shot during the military takeover.[^43] Shan leader Sao Kya Seng also disappeared mysteriously after being stopped at a military checkpoint.

Four months after the coup, on July 7, 1962, a peaceful student protest on Rangoon University campus was violently suppressed by the military, killing over 100 students.[^44] The following day, the army blew up the historic Students Union building—the very site where U Nu and Aung San had organized the 1936 strike. This brutal repression marked the beginning of over five decades of military dictatorship, for which U Nu's governance failures bore some responsibility.

## Personal Life

U Nu married Mya Yi in 1935 while he was still studying for his Bachelor of Laws at Rangoon University.[^45] Their marriage endured through decades of political turbulence, exile, and house arrest, providing U Nu with personal stability amid public upheaval. Little detailed information about Mya Yi or their family life appears in public records, reflecting the relative privacy U Nu maintained regarding his personal affairs despite his prominent public role.

U Nu was known as a deeply religious Buddhist whose spirituality went far beyond political expediency.[^46] His daily routine included extensive meditation and religious observances. Unlike many politicians who invoke religion for political advantage, U Nu genuinely attempted to live according to Buddhist principles, practicing non-violence, compassion, and moral conduct. Colleagues described him as personally modest, eschewing the trappings of power and maintaining simple living habits even as Prime Minister.

Beyond politics, U Nu was an accomplished writer and intellectual. He authored several books, including "The People Win Through" (1951), "Burma under the Japanese" (1954), "An Asian Speaks" (1955), and "Burma Looks Ahead" (1951)—a collection of his speeches as Prime Minister.[^47] His most significant literary work was his autobiography "U Nu: Saturday's Son," published in 1975.[^48] Unusually, the autobiography was written in the third person, as if by a fictitious nephew, providing a candid and sometimes self-critical account of his life and political career. The title "Saturday's Son" refers to the Burmese astrological tradition of assigning characteristics based on one's birth day of the week.

U Nu was described by contemporaries as a gifted politician, orator, and speech writer with considerable intellectual capabilities.[^49] However, he lacked the charismatic presence of Aung San or the ruthless decisiveness of Ne Win. His personality was characterized by intellectual complexity, moral earnestness, and sometimes crippling indecisiveness when faced with difficult choices. These traits made him an effective consensus builder and moral leader but a less effective executive administrator.

Throughout his life, U Nu maintained close friendships with fellow nationalists and international figures. His friendship with U Thant, which began at Rangoon University, endured through their respective careers in Burmese and international politics.[^50] U Nu's personal integrity and lack of corruption distinguished him from many post-colonial leaders who enriched themselves at their nations' expense. Even his harshest critics acknowledged his personal honesty and genuine commitment to his principles, even when those principles proved inadequate for the challenges of governing.

## Legacy

U Nu died on February 14, 1995, in Yangon, Myanmar, at the age of 87.[^51] He had witnessed his country's transformation from British colony to independent democracy to military dictatorship and, just before his death, the beginnings of the democracy movement led by Aung San Suu Kyi. His death came at a moment when Burma was still under military rule, and his democratic vision remained unrealized.

U Nu's legacy is deeply paradoxical—he is remembered simultaneously as the founding father of Burmese democracy and as the leader whose failures enabled military dictatorship. His dedication to democratic ideals, Buddhist principles, and national independence remains unquestioned, yet his inability to resolve ethnic conflicts, control insurgencies, and build effective institutions contributed to democracy's collapse.[^52]

For advocates of Burmese democracy, U Nu represents the path not taken—a leader who, despite his flaws, respected democratic processes, allowed political opposition, maintained press freedom, and voluntarily submitted to electoral judgment. His integrity and patriotism contrast sharply with the corruption and repression that characterized subsequent military rule. The fact that Burma experienced genuine democracy, however imperfect, during U Nu's tenure demonstrates that democratic governance was possible in Burma, contradicting military justifications for authoritarian rule.

U Nu's Buddhist Socialism, though ultimately unsuccessful in practice, represented a serious attempt to reconcile traditional Asian values with modern governance, offering an alternative to both Western capitalism and Soviet communism.[^53] His vision of a welfare state grounded in Buddhist ethics influenced political thinking throughout Southeast Asia and contributed to debates about how post-colonial societies could modernize while preserving cultural identity.

In foreign policy, U Nu's role in establishing the Non-Aligned Movement and advocating for peaceful coexistence had lasting international significance.[^54] His participation in the Bandung Conference helped give voice to newly independent nations seeking to chart their own course during the Cold War, contributing to the reconfiguration of international relations in the post-colonial era.

The Pyidawtha Plan, despite failing to achieve its ambitious goals, demonstrated that post-colonial governments could undertake comprehensive development planning and represented an early model of state-led development that influenced other developing nations.[^55] Though economic difficulties persisted, the plan's emphasis on infrastructure, social services, and welfare established principles that subsequent governments, including military ones, would continue to pursue.

However, U Nu's legacy also includes profound failures. His inability to accommodate ethnic minority demands for federalism within a framework of national unity contributed to conflicts that continue to plague Myanmar decades after his death.[^56] The decision to make Buddhism the state religion inflamed ethnic tensions and violated principles of religious equality, creating wounds that have never healed. His politicization of the military and governance failures provided justifications, however spurious, for military intervention that ended democracy for more than half a century.

U Nu's opposition movement from exile (1969-1980), though ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrated his continued commitment to democratic restoration.[^57] His formation of the Parliamentary Democracy Party and attempts to organize armed resistance from Thailand showed determination, even if the effort lacked realistic prospects for success. His decision to accept amnesty and return to Burma in 1980, while disappointing to some supporters, reflected pragmatic recognition of political realities.[^58]

In contemporary Myanmar, U Nu occupies a complex position in collective memory. For democracy advocates fighting military rule, he represents the democratic tradition they seek to restore. For ethnic minorities, he embodies both the promise of genuine autonomy that was never fulfilled and the Buddhist nationalism that marginalized non-Burman, non-Buddhist communities. For scholars of post-colonial state-building, he exemplifies the challenges of creating functional democracies in ethnically diverse societies with weak institutions and powerful militaries.

U Nu's legacy ultimately poses the question of whether democratic governance could have succeeded in post-independence Burma under different leadership or whether the structural challenges—ethnic diversity, economic underdevelopment, powerful military, insurgencies—made democratic failure inevitable. His life represents both the possibilities and limitations of democratic state-building in post-colonial Asia, offering lessons that remain relevant for contemporary struggles for democracy in Myanmar and beyond.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments that view U Nu favorably emphasize his democratic credentials, personal integrity, and the contrast between his rule and subsequent military dictatorship. Historians note that U Nu maintained democratic institutions during Burma's first decade of independence, holding regular elections and allowing political opposition despite enormous pressures to adopt authoritarian methods.[^59] His voluntary transfer of power to a caretaker military government in 1958 and the military's return of power through free elections in 1960 demonstrate a commitment to democratic principles rare among post-colonial leaders.

U Nu is remembered for his integrity and patriotism, with even critics acknowledging his personal honesty and lack of corruption.[^60] Unlike many post-independence leaders who enriched themselves, U Nu maintained modest living standards and genuine commitment to public service. His moral authority, derived from his Buddhist devotion and ethical conduct, provided legitimacy to democratic governance in a society emerging from colonial rule.

Defenders of U Nu argue that his failures must be understood in context of the enormous challenges he faced. He inherited a nation devastated by World War II, with infrastructure destroyed, ethnic insurgencies raging, communist rebellions threatening the government, and virtually no administrative capacity.[^61] That he maintained democratic governance for over a decade under these conditions represents a significant achievement. Scholars note that U Nu's Buddhist Socialism, while imperfect, offered a thoughtful attempt to adapt democracy to Asian cultural contexts rather than simply importing Western models.

U Nu's leadership contrasts sharply with the military dominance that followed his era, suggesting that despite his shortcomings, democratic rule under U Nu was preferable to what came after.[^62] The freedoms Burmese citizens enjoyed during his tenure—free press, political opposition, regular elections—disappeared under military rule and have never been fully restored. This comparison leads many to view the U Nu era as a golden age of Burmese democracy, however tarnished.

His contributions to international relations through the Non-Aligned Movement and the Bandung Conference receive consistent scholarly praise.[^63] U Nu helped give voice to post-colonial nations seeking alternatives to Cold War alignment, contributing to fundamental changes in international relations. His advocacy for peaceful coexistence and cooperation among nations with different political systems influenced global diplomacy during a period of intense ideological conflict.

U Nu's intellectual contributions through his writings and speeches demonstrated the capacity of Asian leaders to engage sophisticated political and philosophical questions.[^64] His attempt to synthesize Buddhist ethics, socialist economics, and democratic governance, while ultimately unsuccessful, represented serious political thought rather than mere opportunism. Scholars studying political Buddhism and Asian political philosophy continue to engage with U Nu's ideas.

### Negative Views

Critical assessments of U Nu emphasize his governance failures, political naivety, and responsibility for democracy's collapse in Burma. Scholars argue that although U Nu was an able and respected statesman, his government was plagued by communist and ethnic-minority insurrections, economic stagnation, and administrative inefficiency.[^65] His inability to establish effective governance, despite having democratic legitimacy and popular support, demonstrated critical deficiencies in executive capacity.

The most damning criticisms focus on U Nu's failure to address ethnic minority grievances and his violation of the Panglong Agreement's promises of autonomy.[^66] By failing to honor commitments made by Aung San and allowing the central government to neglect ethnic regions, U Nu created conditions for permanent insurgency and separatist movements. His decision to make Buddhism the state religion in 1961 further alienated non-Buddhist ethnic groups and violated principles of religious equality, demonstrating political short-sightedness that prioritized majority support over national unity.[^67]

Critics argue that U Nu's politicization of the military—arbitrarily promoting officers based on ethnic considerations rather than merit—undermined professional military culture and encouraged military intervention in politics.[^68] By treating the armed forces as a political tool rather than a professional institution, U Nu created conditions for the military to view itself as entitled to political power. His willing transfer of authority to Ne Win in 1958 established a precedent for military rule that made the 1962 coup more feasable.

Economic failures receive significant criticism. Although the Pyidawtha Plan was ambitious, it failed to achieve its targets and Burma's economy stagnated during U Nu's tenure.[^69] Rice prices collapsed after the Korean War boom, and the government proved unable to adapt to changing economic conditions. Administrative incompetence and corruption, while not personally involving U Nu, flourished under his watch, suggesting failure to establish effective governance institutions.

Some scholars view U Nu's Buddhist Socialism as incoherent ideology that satisfied neither traditional Buddhists nor modern socialists.[^70] His attempt to reconcile Buddhism with Marxism and democracy created conceptual contradictions that undermined policy coherence. The elevation of Buddhist principles in state policy alienated non-Buddhists while failing to create the "earthly Nirvana" promised to Buddhist constituencies.

The military's justifications for the 1962 coup—that civilian government was corrupt, incompetent, and threatening national unity—while self-serving, contained elements of truth that reflected poorly on U Nu's leadership.[^71] A united and disciplined military appeared as a stark contrast to the fractious, ineffective civilian government. U Nu's apparent willingness to make federalism concessions at the 1962 National Seminar genuinely alarmed military leaders who feared national disintegration, suggesting U Nu failed to build consensus on fundamental constitutional questions.

Critical scholars note that U Nu's exile opposition movement from 1969-1980 demonstrated poor judgment and unrealistic assessment of political possibilities.[^72] His parliamentary government-in-exile in Thailand and attempts at armed resistance never posed credible threats to military rule, yet consumed resources and energy that might have been better directed elsewhere. His eventual acceptance of amnesty and return to Burma in 1980 suggested that the exile period accomplished little beyond prolonging his political career.

Some historians argue that U Nu's failures were not merely personal but reflected fundamental flaws in Burma's post-colonial constitutional structure, which concentrated too much power in the central government while making insufficient accommodations for ethnic diversity.[^73] From this perspective, even more capable leadership might have failed given the structural contradictions built into the 1947 Constitution. However, critics note that U Nu bore responsibility for failing to reform these structures when he had the opportunity and democratic mandate to do so.
