## Summary

Soekarno (also spelled Sukarno) was Indonesia's founding father and first president, serving from 1945 to 1967. Born on June 6, 1901, in Surabaya, Java, he led the Indonesian independence movement against Dutch colonial rule and proclaimed the nation's independence on August 17, 1945.[^1] A charismatic orator and nationalist visionary, Soekarno formulated Pancasila, Indonesia's foundational state ideology, and played a pivotal role in establishing the Non-Aligned Movement.[^2] His presidency was marked by both remarkable achievements in nation-building and controversial authoritarian policies under "Guided Democracy." He was deposed in 1967 following the failed 1965 coup attempt and died under house arrest on June 21, 1970.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Soekarno was born Koesno Sosrodihardjo on June 6, 1901, in Surabaya, East Java, in the Dutch East Indies.[^4] His father, Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo, was a poor Javanese schoolteacher, while his mother, Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai, was Balinese from Buleleng regency.[^5] Like many Javanese people of his time, he was given only one name. After suffering a series of childhood illnesses, he was given the more auspicious name "Sukarno."[^6]

Growing up in abject poverty, the Sukarno family of four lived on a monthly income equivalent to twenty-five Dutch rupiahs.[^7] Despite these hardships, Soekarno spent long periods of his childhood with his grandparents in the village of Tulungagung, where he was exposed to the animism and mysticism of rural Java.[^8] This early exposure to the traditional cultures of Java and Bali deeply influenced his sense of identity and nationalism, shaping the worldview that would later inform his political philosophy.[^9]

His parents met when his father was assigned to teach in Bali, and they requested a transfer to Java before Soekarno's birth.[^10] From his mother, Soekarno inherited Brahmin blood, a distinction that connected him to Bali's highest caste.[^11] As a child, he was admitted into a Dutch-run school, receiving a colonial education that would prove instrumental in his later political career.[^12]

At age 15, Soekarno was sent to secondary school in Surabaya and lived in the home of Omar Said Tjokroaminoto, a prominent civic and religious figure and the first leader of Sarekat Islam.[^13] Tjokroaminoto treated him as a cherished foster son and protégé, financed his further education, and eventually married him off at age 20 to his own 16-year-old daughter.[^14] This relationship proved formative, as Tjokroaminoto became Soekarno's political mentor and inspiration, introducing him to nationalist and Islamic political movements.[^15]

In 1921, Soekarno began studying at the Technische Hogeschool (Technical Institute) in Bandung, where he pursued civil engineering with a focus on architecture.[^16] As a student, he excelled mainly in languages, mastering Javanese, Sundanese, Balinese, and modern Indonesian, which he did much to create and standardize.[^17] After graduating in 1926, Soekarno and his university friend Anwari established an architectural firm.[^18] However, his true passion lay not in engineering but in politics and the liberation of his homeland from colonial rule.

## Rise to Power

While studying in Surabaya, Soekarno became interested in philosophy, politics, and socialism.[^19] His exposure to nationalist ideas intensified during his time in the household of Tjokroaminoto, who led Sarekat Islam, one of Indonesia's earliest mass political organizations.[^20] This early political awakening set Soekarno on a path toward revolutionary nationalism that would define his life.

In 1927, Soekarno established and became leader of the Indonesian Nationalist Party (Partai Nasional Indonesia, or PNI), which aimed for the full independence of Indonesia from Dutch colonial rule.[^21] The PNI advocated for complete independence rather than gradual reform, putting Soekarno at odds with the colonial authorities.[^22] These subversive political activities resulted in his arrest on December 29, 1929, when Dutch colonial authorities conducted a series of raids throughout Java targeting PNI leaders.[^23]

During his trial at the Bandung Landraad courthouse from August to December 1930, Soekarno made a series of long political speeches attacking colonialism and imperialism, collectively titled "Indonesia Menggoegat" (Indonesia Accuses).[^24] These speeches transformed his trial into a political platform, strengthening his image as a national hero and freedom fighter.[^25] In December 1930, he was sentenced to four years in prison but was released early on December 31, 1931.[^26]

His freedom was short-lived. Soekarno was arrested again by Dutch police while visiting fellow nationalist Mohammad Hoesni Thamrin in Jakarta on August 1, 1933.[^27] He spent two years in Dutch jails (1929-31) and more than eight years in exile (1933-42), banished to remote locations including Ende in Flores and Bengkulu in Sumatra.[^28] Rather than breaking his spirit, these imprisonments and exiles only enhanced his legendary status among Indonesians seeking independence.

When the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies in March 1942, Soekarno made the controversial decision to collaborate with the new occupiers.[^29] He considered cooperation with the Japanese as the only realistic means to achieve independence, a tactical choice that would later generate both criticism and vindication.[^30] The Japanese put Soekarno in charge of the 3A propaganda movement, and in March 1943 formed POETERA (Center of People's Power) under the leadership of Soekarno, Mohammad Hatta, Ki Hadjar Dewantara, and KH Mas Mansjoer.[^31]

As World War II drew to a close, Soekarno pressured the Japanese to grant Indonesia its independence.[^32] On June 1, 1945, he delivered his most famous speech defining Pancasila, or the Five Principles (nationalism, internationalism, democracy, social prosperity, and belief in God), which would become Indonesia's foundational state ideology.[^33] After Japan's surrender, radical pemuda (youth) groups pressured Soekarno and Hatta to immediately proclaim Indonesian independence.[^34]

On August 17, 1945, Soekarno and Mohammad Hatta declared Indonesian independence, with Soekarno reading the Proclamation of Independence at his home.[^35] The following day, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence elected Soekarno as president and Hatta as vice-president.[^36] This marked the beginning of Soekarno's leadership of the newly independent nation, though the Dutch would not recognize Indonesian sovereignty until 1949 after a bloody four-year revolutionary war.[^37]

## Major Achievements

### Pancasila and National Unity

Soekarno's most enduring achievement was the formulation of Pancasila in 1945, designed to unify Indonesia's extraordinarily diverse population.[^38] He developed this ideological framework over twenty years, introducing the five principles during a joint session of the BPUPK (Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence) on June 1, 1945.[^39] The five principles are: belief in one supreme God; humanitarianism; nationalism expressed in the unity of Indonesia; consultative democracy; and social justice.[^40]

These principles served as the foundation of Indonesia's constitution and continue to guide its governance today.[^41] Leading a country of over 17,000 islands, hundreds of languages, and diverse ethnic groups, Soekarno emphasized the national motto "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" (Unity in Diversity).[^42] His ability to inspire unity across this fragmented archipelago was one of his most remarkable achievements, creating a cohesive national identity from countless regional, ethnic, and religious identities.[^43]

### The Non-Aligned Movement and Third World Leadership

Soekarno emerged as a leading figure in the decolonization movement and Third World politics during the 1950s and 1960s.[^44] In April 1955, he hosted the landmark Bandung Conference, which brought together leaders from 29 Asian and African nations to promote solidarity and oppose colonialism.[^45] His speech at the opening of the Bandung Conference on April 18, 1955, was a pivotal moment that addressed the need for peace and prosperity among newly independent nations.[^46]

The conference laid the groundwork for the Non-Aligned Movement, which Soekarno co-founded in 1961 with Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser, India's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Yugoslavia's President Josip Broz Tito, and Ghana's President Kwame Nkrumah.[^47] Soekarno's concept encouraged countries to reject alignment with either the Western or Soviet blocs during the Cold War, instead pursuing an independent path focused on creating world peace and equality.[^48] This positioned Indonesia as a major player on the international stage and gave voice to newly independent nations seeking to chart their own courses.

### Infrastructure and Nation-Building

Soekarno's presidency saw the construction of iconic national landmarks that symbolized Indonesia's modernity and independence.[^49] These included the National Monument (Monas) in Jakarta, a towering structure representing the fight for independence, and the Istiqlal Mosque, one of the largest mosques in Southeast Asia.[^50] These projects were not merely architectural achievements but powerful symbols of national pride and identity.

### Liberation of West Irian

Soekarno pursued the annexation of Dutch New Guinea (West Irian) as a conclusion of the Indonesian National Revolution.[^51] This campaign successfully pressured the Dutch to relinquish control of the territory, which was incorporated into Indonesia in 1963.[^52] For Soekarno and many Indonesians, this represented the completion of the independence struggle, unifying all former Dutch colonial territories under one nation.

### NASAKOM Ideology

In his attempt to balance competing political forces, Soekarno developed the NASAKOM concept (Nasionalisme, Agama, Komunisme - Nationalism, Religion, and Communism).[^53] Introduced in 1959 during the Guided Democracy era, this political concept sought to unite the nationalist, religious, and communist groups that held the most power in Indonesian politics.[^54] The three pillars were intended to appease the three main factions—the army, Islamic groups, and the communists—while maintaining Pancasila as the national philosophy.[^55] Though ultimately unsuccessful, NASAKOM represented an ambitious attempt to synthesize competing ideologies into a uniquely Indonesian political framework.[^56]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Authoritarian Guided Democracy

In 1959, Soekarno introduced "Guided Democracy," marking a decisive turn toward authoritarianism.[^57] Frustrated with the instability of parliamentary democracy and regional rebellions, he dissolved the elected parliament and replaced it with a new one in which half of the members were appointed by himself.[^58] On July 5, 1959, President Soekarno, together with the military under the pretext of an emergency, reinstated the 1945 Constitution and dissolved the Konstituante (Constituent Assembly) through a Presidential Decree.[^59]

This system concentrated enormous power in Soekarno's hands, effectively making him a dictator who suppressed democratic freedoms.[^60] State institutions that did not align with his policy direction were dissolved under the pretext of fighting counter-revolution.[^61] Many political figures, particularly from the Masyumi and PSI parties, were subjected to repressive policies, with many thrown into prison because of their political opposition to the regime.[^62]

### Manipol-USDEK and Ideological Control

Soekarno's Manipol-USDEK ideology (Manifesto Politik - Political Manifesto of the 1945 Constitution, Indonesian Socialism, Guided Democracy, Guided Economy, and Indonesian Identity) became mandatory doctrine.[^63] Matters deemed incompatible with Manipol-USDEK were eradicated and labeled as subversive or counterrevolutionary.[^64] Higher education became an important target for indoctrination, with universities required to conform to official ideology.[^65]

Soekarno's political thinking, which began filled with revolutionary idealism and anti-oppression sentiment, evolved into increasingly repressive and anti-democratic positions by the end of his reign.[^66] His authoritarian tendencies defended the establishment and suppressed dissent, moving far from the democratic ideals he had once championed.[^67]

### Economic Mismanagement

While Soekarno excelled at political symbolism and rhetoric, his administration was marked by severe economic mismanagement.[^68] Most of the wealth and glamour of the republic was concentrated in Jakarta, with little attention given to regional development or economic fundamentals.[^69] The result was that educated people and the army became appalled at the mismanagement of the nation.[^70]

The economic situation deteriorated dramatically during the Guided Democracy period, with hyperinflation, corruption, and declining living standards.[^71] Soekarno prioritized grand political projects and monuments over sound economic administration, leading to widespread poverty and economic instability that contributed to his eventual downfall.[^72]

### Confrontation with Malaysia (Konfrontasi)

In 1963, Soekarno launched Konfrontasi (Confrontation), an aggressive campaign against the newly formed Federation of Malaysia.[^73] He saw the Federation as a Western-inspired plot opposing anti-colonial forces in Southeast Asia, asserting it was part of a British scheme against Indonesia.[^74] On January 20, 1963, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio announced Indonesia would pursue a policy of Konfrontasi with Malaysia.[^75]

Indonesia declared the "Crush Malaysia" campaign and launched guerrilla warfare in Malaysia's Bornean territories of Sarawak and Sabah beginning in April 1963.[^76] This undeclared war from 1963 to 1966 drained Indonesia's resources, isolated the country internationally, and achieved no meaningful objectives.[^77] In a dramatic gesture, Indonesia formally withdrew from the United Nations on January 20, 1965, after Malaysia joined the UN Security Council.[^78] Soekarno also announced in 1965 that Indonesia was going to form a Jakarta-Peking Axis, signaling closer alignment with communist China.[^79]

### Relationship with the Communist Party

Soekarno's increasingly close relationship with the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) generated intense controversy and ultimately contributed to his downfall.[^80] During the Guided Democracy period, he played a delicate balancing act by supporting both the largely anticommunist army and the PKI.[^81] The PKI generally supported Soekarno politically, and he admitted more communists into his government while developing a strong relationship with PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit.[^82]

In March 1962, the PKI joined the government, with party leaders Aidit and Njoto appointed as advisory ministers.[^83] Soekarno controlled the country by balancing the nationalism of the armed forces against the rise of the PKI, though the PKI became more powerful as Soekarno became more dependent on Soviet and Chinese aid.[^84] This balancing act collapsed in the aftermath of the September 30, 1965, coup attempt, after which the military blamed the PKI and launched massive anti-communist purges.[^85]

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Family

Soekarno married nine times throughout his life, making him Indonesia's most famous polygamist.[^86] His first marriage was to Siti Oetari in 1921 when he was 20 years old and she was only 16, arranged by his mentor Tjokroaminoto.[^87] However, he never consummated this marriage and divorced her in 1923.[^88]

His second wife, Inggit Garnasih, was 12 years his senior and previously married.[^89] Soekarno fell in love with her and eventually married her after she divorced her first husband.[^90] Although they lived together harmoniously for over twenty years, they had no children together.[^91] Inggit faithfully accompanied Soekarno during his exile to various places, including Ende and Bengkulu, supporting him through his most difficult years.[^92]

Soekarno married Fatmawati in 1943 when she was 20 years old, while still married to Inggit.[^93] Fatmawati became his most politically significant wife, as she sewed the Indonesian flag that was raised during the Proclamation of Independence.[^94] They had five children together: Guntur Soekarnoputra, Megawati Soekarnoputri (who later became Indonesia's fifth president from 2001-2004), Rachmawati Soekarnoputri, Sumawati Soekarnoputri, and Guruh Soekarnoputra.[^95]

His subsequent marriages became increasingly controversial. In June 1954, Soekarno admitted he had taken Hartini as a second wife (while married to Fatmawati), with whom he fathered a son, Taufan Soekarnoputra.[^96] When Soekarno married his fourth wife in 1954, Indonesian women held demonstrations against his endorsement of polygamy, with messages reading "Stop importing wives" appearing on Jakarta's streets.[^97]

His most internationally famous marriage was to Ratna Sari Dewi (born Naoko Nemoto), a 19-year-old Japanese woman he met at a Ginza hostess bar in Tokyo in 1959, when he was 38 years her senior.[^98] After Soekarno's death, Dewi settled in Japan and became a successful entrepreneur in jewelry and cosmetics.[^99] His later marriages to younger women continued this pattern: Yurike Sanger, whom he married in 1964 when he was 63 and she was a 17-year-old high school student, and Heldy Djafar, whom he married in 1966 with an age difference of 48 years.[^100]

### Personality and Charisma

Soekarno was renowned as a brilliant orator with an ability to inspire and mobilize the masses.[^101] His speeches were theatrical performances that combined nationalist fervor, anti-colonial rhetoric, and emotional appeals that resonated deeply with Indonesians.[^102] He mastered multiple languages and could address different ethnic groups in their own tongues, strengthening his image as a unifying figure.[^103]

He was also known for his flamboyant lifestyle and love of grand gestures, enjoying the trappings of power and the company of beautiful women.[^104] His penchant for polygamy and reported affairs generated scandal but also contributed to a larger-than-life persona.[^105] Stories of his visits to Bali, where he allegedly hosted extravagant parties, became part of his controversial legacy.[^106]

Despite his authoritarian tendencies, Soekarno maintained genuine popularity among many Indonesians throughout his presidency, who saw him as the father of their nation and a symbol of independence.[^107] His charisma and nationalist credentials provided him with a reservoir of public support that lasted even as his policies failed.[^108]

## Legacy

Soekarno's legacy remains deeply contested in Indonesia, with his historical reputation oscillating between celebration and condemnation.[^109] Today, he is affectionately remembered as "Bung Karno" (Brother Karno), symbolizing the nation's tumultuous journey from colonization to independence.[^110] His legacy as the founding father of Indonesia and a symbol of national unity and independence continues to be widely respected by many Indonesians, often more so than that of his successor Suharto.[^111]

### Enduring Achievements

Pancasila, Soekarno's philosophical contribution, remains Indonesia's official state ideology and continues to guide the nation's constitutional framework.[^112] The principles he articulated in 1945 still serve as the foundation for Indonesian governance and national identity.[^113] His emphasis on "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" (Unity in Diversity) continues to resonate in a country that remains extraordinarily diverse.[^114]

The National Monument and other iconic structures built during his presidency remain powerful symbols of Indonesian nationalism and independence.[^115] These landmarks serve as constant reminders of Soekarno's vision for a modern, independent Indonesia that could stand proudly among the nations of the world.[^116]

### International Impact

On the international stage, Soekarno's role in founding the Non-Aligned Movement established Indonesia as a significant voice for the developing world.[^117] The Bandung Conference he hosted became a watershed moment in post-colonial history, inspiring liberation movements across Africa and Asia.[^118] His vision of Third World solidarity and opposition to neo-colonialism influenced a generation of leaders in newly independent nations.[^119]

### The Soekarno Dynasty

His political legacy extends through his daughter Megawati Soekarnoputri, who served as Indonesia's fifth president from 2001 to 2004.[^120] The Soekarno family name remains powerful in Indonesian politics, with various descendants involved in political and social causes.[^121] This dynastic element demonstrates the enduring appeal of Soekarno's nationalist credentials and founding father status.[^122]

### Contested Memory

Under Suharto's New Order regime (1966-1998), Soekarno's reputation was systematically tarnished.[^123] Official history portrayed "Soeharto and the army as the true heroes who had saved Indonesia from calamities and brought it to peace and prosperity," while "Soekarno and the PKI were the bad guys who perverted and betrayed their own country."[^124] This version of history dominated Indonesian education and public discourse for over three decades.[^125]

Since the fall of Suharto in 1998 and Indonesia's democratization, there has been a reassessment of Soekarno's legacy.[^126] The 7th National History Conference in 2001 showed signs of change, with the Association of Historians of Indonesia making a formal "declaration of independence" from traditional state influence.[^127] Scholars have begun to present more nuanced assessments that acknowledge both Soekarno's achievements and failures.[^128]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many historians and supporters celebrate Soekarno as the proclaimer of independence and the architect of the Indonesian nation.[^129] Against the immense challenges of unifying thousands of islands, hundreds of ethnic groups, and multiple religions into a single nation-state, Soekarno's achievement in establishing Indonesian national identity was remarkable.[^130] His formulation of Pancasila provided an ideological framework that could accommodate Indonesia's extraordinary diversity without privileging any single ethnic or religious group.[^131]

Scholars recognize Soekarno's crucial role in the independence struggle and his courage in confronting Dutch colonialism.[^132] His willingness to endure imprisonment and exile for his nationalist principles earned him genuine heroic status.[^133] His collaboration with the Japanese, while controversial, is defended by some historians as a pragmatic strategy that ultimately facilitated Indonesian independence rather than prolonging Dutch rule.[^134]

Soekarno's leadership during the revolutionary period (1945-1949) is widely praised, as he provided the symbolic and political leadership necessary to sustain resistance against Dutch attempts at re-colonization.[^135] His diplomatic skills helped Indonesia gain international recognition and support during the independence struggle.[^136]

His vision of Third World solidarity and opposition to imperialism resonated far beyond Indonesia's borders.[^137] The Bandung Conference represented a historic moment when colonized and formerly colonized peoples asserted their right to self-determination and charted an independent path between the Cold War superpowers.[^138] Many scholars view Soekarno's internationalism as a significant contribution to global anti-colonial movements.[^139]

Supporters argue that Soekarno's authoritarian turn must be understood in the context of the immense challenges facing Indonesia—regional rebellions, economic underdevelopment, Cold War pressures, and the difficulty of governing such a diverse nation.[^140] From this perspective, Guided Democracy was an attempt to preserve national unity and prevent disintegration, even if the methods were flawed.[^141]

### Negative Views

Critics emphasize Soekarno's evolution from revolutionary idealist to authoritarian ruler who suppressed democracy and concentrated power in his own hands.[^142] The dissolution of elected institutions, imprisonment of political opponents, and mandatory adherence to state ideology represented a betrayal of the democratic principles he had initially championed.[^143] Soekarno's political thinking at the end of his power was "very authoritarian, defending the establishment and anti-democracy."[^144]

Historians point to severe economic mismanagement during Soekarno's presidency, with hyperinflation, corruption, and declining living standards that caused immense suffering.[^145] His focus on political symbolism and grand projects came at the expense of sound economic administration and development that could have improved ordinary Indonesians' lives.[^146] The concentration of wealth in Jakarta while rural areas remained impoverished demonstrated a failure to address fundamental economic challenges.[^147]

The Konfrontasi campaign against Malaysia is widely viewed as a disastrous policy that isolated Indonesia internationally, drained resources, and achieved no meaningful objectives.[^148] Withdrawing from the United Nations and the World Bank further isolated Indonesia and damaged its international standing.[^149] Critics argue these policies reflected Soekarno's prioritization of anti-imperialist rhetoric over Indonesia's practical interests.[^150]

Soekarno's relationship with the PKI and his failure to prevent the violence of 1965-1966 remains highly controversial.[^151] While he may not have directly ordered the mass killings that followed the coup attempt, his policies had enabled the PKI's growth and created the polarized political environment that made such violence possible.[^152] His refusal to ban the PKI after the coup attempt, despite military pressure, demonstrated either political weakness or complicity.[^153]

Some historians argue that Soekarno's nationalist historiography committed "the sin of anachronism" and that his use of history served political propaganda rather than objective understanding.[^154] Indonesian historiography during and after Soekarno's era suffered from "cultural and structural weaknesses" and "insufficient understanding and lack of skill in the use of scientific historical methods," making historical accounts vulnerable to political manipulation.[^155]

Critics of Soekarno's personal life point to his serial polygamy and relationships with much younger women as reflecting a problematic attitude toward women and an abuse of his position of power.[^156] His lifestyle contradicted the socialist and egalitarian principles he claimed to champion, revealing hypocrisy in his public image.[^157]
