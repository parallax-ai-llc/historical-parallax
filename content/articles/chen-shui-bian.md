## Summary

Chen Shui-bian (陳水扁) served as the fifth President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 2000 to 2008, becoming the first president from the Democratic Progressive Party and ending the Kuomintang's 55 years of continuous rule.[^1] Born into poverty in rural Tainan, Chen rose to become Taiwan's youngest lawyer and a prominent democracy activist before his historic electoral victory.[^2] His presidency was marked by significant advances in Taiwan's democratic institutions and a strong push for Taiwanese identity, but was ultimately overshadowed by corruption scandals that led to his conviction and imprisonment in 2009.[^3] Released on medical parole in 2015, Chen remains one of the most controversial and polarizing figures in modern Taiwanese politics.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Chen Shui-bian was born on October 12, 1950, to an impoverished tenant farming family in Guantian Township of Tainan County (now part of Tainan City), Taiwan.[^5] There is some discrepancy regarding his official birth date: he was born on the second day of the ninth lunar month in 1950 but was not formally issued a birth certificate until February 18, 1951, because of doubts that he would survive.[^6] This difficult beginning would shape his political identity as a man who rose from humble origins to Taiwan's highest office.

Chen's childhood was marked by extreme poverty. His family worked as tenant farmers, struggling to make ends meet in rural southern Taiwan.[^7] Despite these hardships, Chen demonstrated exceptional academic ability from an early age. He excelled in his studies and his academic excellence propelled him to the prestigious National Tainan First Senior High School, where he continued to distinguish himself.[^8]

Chen's educational success became his pathway out of poverty. He won a scholarship to National Taiwan University, Taiwan's most prestigious institution, and was admitted in June 1969.[^9] Initially enrolled as a business administration major, he switched to law in his first year and became editor of the school's law review.[^10] His brilliance as a law student was remarkable: he passed the bar exams before the completion of his junior year with the highest score, becoming Taiwan's youngest lawyer at just 24 years old when he graduated in 1974 with an LL.B. in commercial law.[^11]

Chen's early life experiences—poverty, academic success, and legal training—profoundly influenced his political worldview. He later stated that growing up in a poor farming family gave him empathy for ordinary Taiwanese people and a determination to challenge the established elite.[^12] His legal education would prove instrumental in his entry into politics as a defender of Taiwan's democracy movement.

## Rise to Power

Chen Shui-bian's entry into politics came through his work as a defense attorney for participants in the Kaohsiung Incident, a pivotal event in Taiwan's democratization movement. On December 10, 1979, Formosa Magazine, a publication that called for freedom of the press and an end to both martial law and one-party rule, organized a demonstration in Kaohsiung commemorating Human Rights Day.[^13] The incident sparked a government crackdown that became widely regarded as a seminal event in the post-war history of Taiwan and the watershed of the Taiwan democratization movements.[^14]

In 1980, Chen successfully defended participants in the Kaohsiung Incident in a military court.[^15] While his client Huang Hsin-chieh, the leading opposition dissident, and seven co-defendants—including his future Vice President Annette Lu—were found guilty, Chen became known for his forceful and colorful arguments.[^16] He later stated that it was during this period that he realized the unfairness of the political system in Taiwan and became politically active as a member of the Tangwai movement, the "outside the party" opposition to the ruling Kuomintang.[^17]

Chen's legal reputation and political activism led to his election to the Taipei City Council in 1981, just one year after the Kaohsiung Incident.[^18] His political career was not without setbacks: in the mid-1980s, he spent eight months in prison on charges of libeling a KMT official.[^19] However, this imprisonment only enhanced his credentials as an opposition figure.

From 1989 to 1994, Chen served in Taiwan's legislature, continuing to build his political base and reputation.[^20] His breakthrough came in 1994 when he was elected as Mayor of Taipei, largely as the result of a vote split between the KMT incumbent Huang Ta-chou and the KMT-spin-off New Party candidate Jaw Shaw-kong.[^21] This was particularly significant as 1994 marked the first public election for Mayor of Taipei.[^22]

During his mayoral term from 1994 to 1998, Chen received accolades for his campaigns to drive illegal gambling and prostitution rackets out of Taipei, establishing a reputation as a reformer and effective administrator.[^23] Although he lost the mayoral election of 1998 to the KMT's candidate and future president Ma Ying-jeou, his time as mayor had positioned him as the leading opposition figure for national office.[^24]

## Major Achievements

Chen Shui-bian's most significant achievement was his election as President of Taiwan on March 18, 2000, with 39.3% of the popular vote.[^25] This historic victory, achieved when KMT candidates James Soong and Lien Chan split the vote, ended more than half a century of Kuomintang rule on the island.[^26] It was also the first time in Chinese history that a ruling political party peacefully transferred power to an opposition party under a democratic system.[^27]

Contributing factors to his victory included the last-minute public endorsement by President of the Academia Sinica and Nobel laureate Yuan T. Lee, as well as Chen's highly effective campaign that appealed to the Fukien Taiwanese, women, young people, the poor, and those who believed that Taiwan should be legally separate from mainland China.[^28]

In his first term, Chen sought to balance his party's pro-independence ideology with pragmatic governance. He announced the "Four Noes and One Without" policy in his May 20, 2000 inauguration speech, pledging that as long as the PRC did not intend to use military force against Taiwan, he would not declare independence, change the name of the country to "Republic of Taiwan", push for the inclusion of "special state-to-state relations" in the Constitution, or promote a referendum on independence.[^29] Additionally, the "One Without" meant his administration would not abolish the National Unification Council or the National Unification Guidelines.[^30]

Chen signed several important pieces of legislation during his presidency, including the Referendum Act in 2003, which allowed for direct democracy on certain issues, though the Pan-Blue Coalition set an extremely high bar to prevent its widespread application.[^31] He also signed a Taiwan-Panama Free Trade Agreement with Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso, expanding Taiwan's international economic ties.[^32]

Chen's government promoted policies to strengthen Taiwan's distinct identity through what became known as "de-sinicization" efforts. These included renaming public institutions to remove references to China and make them more Taiwan-centric, rewriting school curricula to place Taiwan at the center of different disciplines, and changing the names of state-owned enterprises.[^33] In February 2007, Chunghwa Post Co. was renamed Taiwan Post Co. and Chinese Petroleum Corporation became CPC Corporation, Taiwan.[^34] After Chen came to power in 2000, the DPP cancelled national holidays including Sun Yat-sen's Birthday and Constitution Day.[^35]

Chen won reelection in 2004 by the narrowest of margins—roughly 29,000 votes out of 13 million cast—after surviving an assassination attempt while campaigning the day before the election.[^36] Despite Taiwan's poor economic performance during his first term and no progress in cross-Strait relations, Chen ran an excellent campaign focused on appropriating Taiwan identity and controlling the agenda.[^37]

His administration also achieved important institutional reforms. Scholars have noted that democratic practices were deepened during his presidency through the depoliticization of the military and intelligence forces, the ascendance of an independent and professional judicial system, and a strengthened commitment to constitutionalism and respect for the rule of law.[^38] He passed legislation to strengthen the independence of government agencies from the legislature and increased Taiwan's reliance on renewable energy while fostering economic and civil society development.[^39]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Chen Shui-bian's presidency was plagued by numerous controversies that ultimately defined his legacy. The most damaging were the corruption scandals that emerged during his second term and culminated in his conviction and imprisonment.

Prosecutors alleged that Chen and his wife together embezzled NT$104 million (US$3.12 million) from a special presidential fund and received bribes of US$11.73 million in connection with a government land procurement deal and a separate construction project.[^40] About an hour after he left the Presidential Office Building as a former president and no longer enjoyed presidential immunity, he was arrested and restricted from leaving the nation by Taiwanese prosecutors.[^41]

On September 11, 2009, Taiwan's former President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Taipei District Court in a 1,415-page verdict.[^42] Chen and Wu were found guilty of money laundering, forgery, embezzlement, bribe-taking, and other charges, in violation of the Punishment of Corruption Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, and the Criminal Code.[^43] The life sentence was subsequently reduced through appeals—eventually to about 17-20 years.[^44]

According to a December 7, 2010 press release by the Swiss Federal Authorities, the Attorney General of Switzerland returned approximately CHF 20 million to the Supreme Prosecutors Office of Taiwan, part of the money that was deposited in Switzerland by Chen.[^45]

Beyond corruption, Chen faced criticism for his handling of cross-Strait relations. In October 2000, Chen halted construction of a nuclear power plant, angering members of the KMT-controlled legislature. In the ensuing political crisis, the country's economy faltered as investor confidence waned. He later reversed this decision in February 2001.[^46]

Although Chen initially pledged the moderate Four Noes and One Without policy, by the end of his presidency he proposed the radical concept of "One Country on Each Side," which articulated that the PRC and ROC are two different countries, drawing condemnation from the KMT and internationally from the PRC and mild criticism from the United States.[^47] On February 27, 2006, Chen dismantled the National Unification Council and Guidelines, effectively breaking the promises made in 2000.[^48]

The 2004 assassination attempt on Chen and Vice President Lu the day before the election sparked intense controversy. The March 19 shooting incident occurred while they were campaigning in Tainan, with both sustaining minor injuries.[^49] Some pan-Blue supporters painted the incident as a sham staged to boost sympathy for Chen and win the election, arguing that the wounds were improbably light and citing various perceived irregularities.[^50] The case was officially closed in 2005 with all evidence pointing to a single deceased suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung, though skepticism remained, with a poll finding that only 21% of respondents believed the theory.[^51]

Chen's de-sinicization policies were heavily criticized by his domestic opponents, the Chinese Communist Party, and even Washington.[^52] Critics argued that his "Name Rectification Campaign" and efforts to change educational curricula were unnecessarily divisive and provocative.[^53]

By the time his second term ended, Chen's approval rating was in the gutter, and elite politics in Taiwan had become more divided and acrimonious during his presidency.[^54]

## Personal Life

Chen Shui-bian married Wu Shu-chen (吳淑珍) on February 20, 1975, against the wishes of her father.[^55] Wu was born on July 11, 1953, into a wealthy medical family, a stark contrast to Chen's impoverished background.[^56] She had been his middle school classmate before their romantic relationship developed.[^57]

The couple had two children together: a daughter, Chen Hsing-yu, who became a dentist, and a son, Chen Chih-chung, who received a law degree in Taiwan and gained a Master of Laws from the University of California, Berkeley in 2005.[^58]

The Chen family experienced tragedy on November 21, 1985, when Wu Shu-chen was hit twice by a hand tractor driven by Chang Jong-tsai as Chen and Wu were thanking their supporters three days after Chen lost an election.[^59] She was left paralyzed from the waist down, a life-altering event that profoundly affected the family.[^60] Despite her disability, Wu remained politically active and served one term in the Legislative Yuan from 1987 to 1990.[^61] As the wife of President Chen Shui-bian, Wu was the First Lady of the Republic of China from 2000 to 2008.[^62]

Chen is commonly known by the nickname "A-Bian," a diminutive form that reflects the informal and personable image he cultivated throughout his political career.[^63] This nickname became synonymous with his political brand and was widely used by both supporters and critics.

The corruption charges that engulfed Chen's presidency also implicated his family members and close aides, creating a scandal that extended beyond just the president himself.[^64] In 2009, Chen and his wife Wu Shu-chen were both convicted on bribery charges, with Chen sentenced to 19 years (reduced from life imprisonment) and both imprisoned in Taipei Prison.[^65]

Chen was granted medical parole on January 5, 2015, although it was scheduled to last only three months, he was granted numerous extensions.[^66] Today Chen remains on medical parole, forbidden to make public speeches, and notably shunned by the DPP party he helped propel to power.[^67]

## Legacy

Chen Shui-bian's legacy remains deeply contested and continues to shape Taiwan's political landscape. When he left office in 2008, his tenure was widely considered a disappointment, with the Chen years (2000-2008) remembered mostly for relentless partisan fighting over cross-Strait relations and national identity questions, prolonged political gridlock, and damaging corruption scandals.[^68]

However, more recent scholarship has challenged this purely negative narrative. As one assessment notes, "This conventional narrative obscures a more complex and more positive story," highlighting how democratic practices were deepened during this period through institutional reforms.[^69] The authors of "Taiwan's Democracy Challenged: The Chen Shui-bian Years" argue that "these years were not squandered" and that "by the end of the Chen Shui-bian era, Taiwan's democracy was firmly consolidated."[^70]

Chen's most enduring legacy may be the peaceful transfer of power he represented. His 2000 election marked the first time in Chinese history that a ruling political party peacefully transferred power to an opposition party under a democratic system.[^71] This established a crucial precedent for democratic alternation that has since become normalized in Taiwan's political culture.

His presidency also accelerated the development of a distinct Taiwanese identity separate from Chinese nationalism. Through de-sinicization policies and name rectification campaigns, Chen helped shift Taiwan's cultural and political center of gravity toward a Taiwan-centric worldview.[^72] While controversial, these efforts reflected and reinforced growing sentiment among Taiwanese, particularly younger generations, who identify as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.

The corruption scandals that marred Chen's presidency had a lasting impact on Taiwan's political discourse. He became Taiwan's first former president to be convicted of corruption charges, a fall from grace that shocked many who had viewed him as a champion of democracy and justice.[^73] This tarnished the DPP's anti-corruption credentials and provided ammunition for KMT critics who argued that the party was unfit to govern.

Interestingly, in recent years, the perception of Chen has begun to improve, and this increase in public support was likely partly responsible for his release on medical parole.[^74] Some observers have suggested that subsequent political developments, including concerns about Chinese influence and KMT governance, have led to a reassessment of Chen's presidency.

Chen's legacy is also intertwined with Taiwan's relationship with China and the United States. His push for Taiwan identity and occasional provocations toward Beijing tested both cross-Strait relations and Taiwan's alliance with Washington, establishing patterns that continue to define Taiwan's diplomatic challenges.[^75]

The historical assessment reflects mixed feelings about Chen's legacy, which probably indicates a complex reality where democracy in Taiwan during his presidency both developed and stalled.[^76] As one analysis concluded, "the ugly headlines and incendiary political rhetoric of the era have overshadowed subtler but more important political changes that occurred, both good and bad, in Taiwanese politics and society."[^77]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who take a more favorable view of Chen's presidency emphasize the significant institutional advances Taiwan made during his tenure. According to research published by Stanford University's Hoover Institution, democratic practices were deepened through "the depoliticization of the military and intelligence forces, the ascendance of an independent and professional judicial system, a strengthened commitment to constitutionalism and respect for the rule of law."[^78]

Supporters argue that by the end of the Chen Shui-bian era, Taiwan's democracy was firmly consolidated, representing a crucial achievement in the island's political development.[^79] They contend that the Chen years were not squandered, pointing to subtle but important political changes that occurred in Taiwanese politics and society, even if these were overshadowed by headline-grabbing controversies.[^80]

Chen's defenders note that much of what happened was beyond his control, including the severe political gridlock created by a KMT-controlled legislature that opposed his initiatives at every turn.[^81] They argue that Chen faced unique challenges as the first non-KMT president, operating in a system where the opposition controlled the legislature and could block his agenda.

Regarding the corruption charges, his supporters protested that the detention of Chen for more than 600 days without proving him guilty was illegal, inhumane and unjust, and a result of political revenge by the Kuomintang.[^82] They believe that the frenzy surrounding him and his trial reflected the political climate in Taiwan rather than evidence of wrongdoing.[^83]

Sympathetic scholars also credit Chen with accelerating Taiwan's development of a distinct national identity and advancing the cause of Taiwanese self-determination, even if his methods were sometimes controversial.[^84] His willingness to challenge Beijing's claims over Taiwan and assert Taiwan's sovereignty resonated with many Taiwanese who felt their distinct identity had been suppressed under previous KMT administrations.

### Negative Views

Critics of Chen's presidency offer a starkly different assessment. Some scholars have argued for "the devolution of Taiwan's democracy during the Chen Shui-bian era rather than its consolidation," pointing to deteriorating civil liberties, Chen playing ethnic politics, and his administration's lack of respect for democratic values.[^85]

The corruption charges remain the central pillar of negative assessments. By the time his second term ended, Chen's approval rating was in the gutter, and soon after he was convicted of corruption and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment, later reduced.[^86] The fact that Swiss authorities returned approximately CHF 20 million that had been deposited in Switzerland provides concrete evidence that bolsters critics' claims.[^87]

Critics argue that "the view that money ruled in politics and the prevalence of personal greed caused corruption to worsen" during the Chen era, undermining Taiwan's democratic institutions rather than strengthening them.[^88] They contend that elite politics became more divided and acrimonious during his presidency, poisoning Taiwan's political culture with excessive partisanship and polarization.[^89]

Regarding cross-Strait relations, critics argue that Chen's provocations toward Beijing were reckless and damaged Taiwan's security and economic interests. His abandonment of the Four Noes and One Without policy, culminating in the "One Country on Each Side" formulation and the dismantling of the National Unification Council, is viewed as unnecessarily antagonizing China without achieving any concrete benefits for Taiwan.[^90]

Skeptics also question the 2004 assassination attempt, with some maintaining it was staged to generate sympathy votes in a close election.[^91] The fact that only 21% of respondents in one poll believed the official explanation suggests widespread public skepticism.[^92]

Critics of his de-sinicization policies argue that Chen's "Name Rectification Campaign" and curriculum changes were divisive, provocative, and served primarily to advance his political agenda rather than Taiwan's genuine interests.[^93] They contend that these policies deepened social divisions and created unnecessary tensions with both Beijing and Washington.
