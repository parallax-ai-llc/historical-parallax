## Summary

David Hume (1711-1776) was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, economist, and essayist who is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of Western philosophy and the Scottish Enlightenment[^1]. His empiricist approach to philosophical questions and his skeptical treatment of religion, causation, and induction profoundly influenced subsequent philosophical thought[^2]. Hume's major works include "A Treatise of Human Nature" (1739-1740), "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" (1748), and his multi-volume "History of England"[^3]. Despite facing significant controversy during his lifetime for his religious skepticism, Hume's legacy as a foundational thinker in empiricism, naturalism, and the philosophy of mind remains unparalleled[^4].

## Early Life and Background

David Hume was born on April 26, 1711 (Old Style) or May 7, 1711 (New Style), in Edinburgh, Scotland, to a moderately wealthy family[^5]. His father, Joseph Home (the family name was later changed to Hume), was a lawyer who died when David was an infant, leaving the family's estate, Ninewells, near Berwick-upon-Tweed, to David's older brother[^6]. His mother, Katherine Falconer, came from a family of lawyers and was responsible for raising David and his siblings after their father's death[^7].

Hume entered the University of Edinburgh at the unusually young age of twelve (though this was not uncommon at the time) around 1723[^8]. While his family intended for him to pursue a career in law, Hume found himself drawn to philosophy and literature instead[^9]. He left the university without taking a degree, which was common practice for those not entering the clergy[^10]. During his teenage years, Hume experienced what he described as a breakthrough in his thinking, discovering what he believed to be "a new Scene of Thought"[^11].

In 1734, after a brief and unsuccessful attempt at a career in commerce in Bristol, Hume moved to France, where he spent three years in relative isolation at La Flèche in Anjou, the site of the famous Jesuit college where René Descartes had studied[^12]. It was during this period of intensive study and writing that Hume composed his first and most comprehensive philosophical work, "A Treatise of Human Nature," completing it before his twenty-sixth birthday[^13]. This early work would lay the foundation for his empiricist philosophy, though its initial reception would prove deeply disappointing to the young philosopher[^14].

## Rise to Prominence

Hume's path to intellectual prominence was neither straightforward nor immediate. When "A Treatise of Human Nature" was published in three volumes between 1739 and 1740, it famously "fell dead-born from the press," as Hume himself later ruefully noted[^15]. The work received little attention and what reviews it did receive were largely negative or dismissive[^16]. This failure devastated Hume and prompted him to reconsider his approach to philosophical writing[^17].

Undeterred by this setback, Hume published "Essays, Moral and Political" in 1741-1742, which proved far more successful with the reading public[^18]. These essays demonstrated Hume's ability to write in a more accessible style while addressing important philosophical and political questions[^19]. The success of these essays helped establish Hume's reputation as a literary figure and opened doors that had previously been closed[^20].

In 1744, Hume applied for the Chair of Moral Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh but was rejected, largely due to opposition from the clergy who objected to his perceived atheism and skepticism[^21]. This would be the first of several academic rejections Hume would face throughout his career[^22]. Similarly, in 1751, he was denied the position of Chair of Logic at the University of Glasgow[^23]. These rejections were significant setbacks but ultimately may have freed Hume to pursue his writing and other intellectual activities more independently[^24].

Hume's revised and shortened version of his earlier work, published as "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" in 1748 (originally titled "Philosophical Essays Concerning Human Understanding"), received a warmer reception and helped solidify his philosophical reputation[^25]. His "An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals" (1751) further developed his moral philosophy and is a work Hume himself considered his best[^26].

The publication of his "Political Discourses" in 1752 proved to be Hume's greatest success during his lifetime[^27]. The work was quickly translated into French and established Hume as an important economic and political thinker[^28]. Perhaps most significantly for his contemporary reputation, Hume's multi-volume "History of England" (published between 1754 and 1762) became a bestseller and the standard history of England for many decades[^29]. This work, rather than his philosophical writings, was the primary source of Hume's fame and income during his lifetime[^30].

## Major Achievements

David Hume's contributions to philosophy, particularly in the areas of epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and ethics, represent some of the most significant achievements in Western intellectual history[^31]. His empiricist approach, which held that all knowledge derives from sensory experience, fundamentally challenged rationalist assumptions that had dominated philosophical thought[^32].

One of Hume's most important philosophical contributions was his analysis of causation[^33]. He argued that our belief in cause and effect relationships is not based on rational deduction but rather on habit and custom formed through repeated experience[^34]. According to Hume, when we observe that events of type A are constantly followed by events of type B, we develop an expectation that this pattern will continue, but we have no rational justification for this expectation beyond our psychological habit[^35]. This "problem of induction" remains a central concern in philosophy of science and epistemology to this day[^36].

Hume's skeptical treatment of religious belief was equally groundbreaking and controversial[^37]. In his "Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion" (published posthumously in 1779), Hume subjected traditional arguments for God's existence, particularly the argument from design, to devastating critique[^38]. His essay "Of Miracles" in the "Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding" argued that it is always more rational to believe that testimony about miracles is false than to believe the miracle actually occurred, given the overwhelming evidence from experience against violations of natural law[^39].

In moral philosophy, Hume developed an influential account of ethics grounded in sentiment rather than reason[^40]. He famously argued that reason alone cannot motivate action and that moral distinctions are derived from feelings of approval or disapproval rather than from rational reflection[^41]. His assertion that one cannot derive an "ought" from an "is" – that is, that prescriptive statements cannot be logically deduced from purely descriptive ones – has become known as "Hume's Law" or the "is-ought problem" and remains a foundational issue in meta-ethics[^42].

Hume's economic writings, particularly in his "Political Discourses," made significant contributions to economic theory[^43]. He developed theories about money, interest, trade, and the balance of trade that influenced later economists including Adam Smith[^44]. His analysis of the relationship between money supply and prices anticipated later theories of inflation[^45]. He also articulated a sophisticated version of the quantity theory of money and provided early insights into what would later be called the price-specie flow mechanism[^46].

As a historian, Hume's "History of England" was monumental both in scope and influence[^47]. Spanning from Julius Caesar's invasion to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the work was notable for its attempt at impartiality and its sophisticated analysis of political and social forces[^48]. While modern historians have identified various biases and inaccuracies in Hume's history, it remained the standard English history for decades and helped establish history as a literary and philosophical discipline[^49].

Hume's influence extended beyond his own writings to his role in the Scottish Enlightenment[^50]. He was a central figure in the intellectual community of Edinburgh, engaging with and influencing thinkers such as Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson, and William Robertson[^51]. His correspondence with leading intellectuals across Europe helped disseminate Enlightenment ideas and fostered intellectual exchange[^52].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his intellectual achievements, Hume was a deeply controversial figure during his lifetime, and his work has continued to generate criticism and debate[^53]. The most persistent source of controversy was his perceived atheism and attacks on religious belief[^54]. Although Hume was careful in his published works to avoid explicit denial of God's existence, his skeptical arguments were widely interpreted as fundamentally irreligious[^55].

The charge of atheism had serious practical consequences for Hume[^56]. As mentioned, it contributed to his rejection for academic positions at both Edinburgh and Glasgow universities[^57]. In 1756, the Church of Scotland seriously considered charging Hume with heresy, and only the lack of clear jurisdiction over a layman prevented formal proceedings[^58]. Even his friends sometimes found his religious views troubling; James Boswell recorded visiting Hume on his deathbed, seemingly disturbed to find that the philosopher faced death with equanimity despite his lack of belief in an afterlife[^59].

Hume's philosophy itself became the subject of significant philosophical criticism[^60]. Immanuel Kant famously credited Hume with awakening him from his "dogmatic slumber," but Kant's critical philosophy was in large part an attempt to answer and overcome Humean skepticism[^61]. Thomas Reid and the Scottish Common Sense school directly opposed Hume's skeptical conclusions, arguing that his premises led to absurd results and that common sense should take precedence[^62].

Some critics argued that Hume's skepticism was self-defeating[^63]. If all knowledge derives from experience and we can never have certainty about causal connections, then how can we trust Hume's own philosophical conclusions, which themselves depend on reasoning about experience?[^64] This challenge to the consistency of Hume's system has been debated extensively in philosophical literature[^65].

Hume's political writings also attracted controversy[^66]. His "History of England" was criticized by Whigs for being too sympathetic to the Stuart monarchy and by Tories for not being sympathetic enough[^67]. His political essays sometimes defended positions that offended various political factions[^68]. His essay "Of the Original Contract" challenged social contract theory, which was foundational to much liberal political thought[^69].

In his personal conduct, Hume was accused of moral failures that some felt contradicted his philosophical positions[^70]. His participation in diplomatic and military affairs, particularly his service with the British Embassy in Paris and later as Under-Secretary of State, led some to question the relationship between his philosophical principles and his practical actions[^71]. Critics pointed to apparent inconsistencies between his theoretical skepticism and his conventional career choices[^72].

Modern scholars have also identified problematic aspects of Hume's thought[^73]. Some of his writings contain racist views typical of his era, including passages suggesting the natural inferiority of non-European peoples[^74]. A notorious footnote in his essay "Of National Characters" (later revised but not fully retracted) expressed skepticism about the intellectual achievements of Black people and other non-white groups[^75]. These views have led to contemporary debates about Hume's legacy, including the renaming of the David Hume Tower at the University of Edinburgh[^76].

Feminist philosophers have critiqued Hume's treatment of gender, noting that his writings largely ignore women as moral and intellectual agents and sometimes express conventional sexist views of his time[^77]. While some scholars have attempted to extract feminist-friendly resources from Hume's philosophy, others argue that his overall framework reinforces problematic gender assumptions[^78].

## Personal Life

David Hume never married and left no direct descendants, though this appears to have been more by circumstance and choice than by any inability to form close relationships[^79]. He maintained warm friendships throughout his life and was noted for his sociability and good humor[^80]. His contemporaries frequently remarked on the apparent contrast between his skeptical philosophy and his cheerful, conventional personality[^81].

Adam Smith, one of Hume's closest friends, famously eulogized him as approaching "as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man, as perhaps the nature of human frailty will permit"[^82]. This assessment, published shortly after Hume's death, itself became controversial given Hume's religious skepticism[^83]. Other friends and acquaintances similarly testified to Hume's amiability, generosity, and good nature[^84].

Hume had a well-known fondness for good food and company[^85]. His time in Paris from 1763 to 1766 as secretary to the British ambassador was particularly socially successful; he was celebrated in French salons and became close with several prominent French intellectuals, including Jean-Jacques Rousseau[^86]. However, his relationship with Rousseau ended badly when the paranoid Rousseau became convinced that Hume was part of a conspiracy against him[^87].

Physically, Hume was described as corpulent, especially in his later years, with a ruddy complexion and a face that struck some observers as more suited to a merchant than a philosopher[^88]. He was self-deprecating about his appearance, once joking about his "Face and Figure" being ill-suited to inspire philosophical awe[^89]. Despite this, portraits suggest an intelligent and kindly countenance[^90].

Hume's letters reveal a man capable of deep attachments and considerable emotional range[^91]. His correspondence shows him offering support to friends in distress, engaging in intellectual debate with good humor, and expressing genuine affection for his close associates[^92]. He maintained particularly warm relationships with his sister Katherine and his nephew David, who inherited his manuscripts and oversaw posthumous publications[^93].

In his final years, Hume suffered from intestinal cancer, which he bore with the philosophical equanimity one might expect from a student of Stoic philosophy[^94]. His correspondence from this period shows him facing death with humor and resignation, making arrangements for his unpublished works and maintaining his intellectual interests until the end[^95]. He died at his house in Edinburgh's New Town on August 25, 1776, at the age of 65[^96].

## Legacy

David Hume's influence on subsequent philosophy, both in his own time and continuing to the present day, can hardly be overstated[^97]. His empiricist approach fundamentally shaped the development of modern philosophy and continues to inform contemporary debates in epistemology, metaphysics, philosophy of mind, and ethics[^98].

In epistemology and philosophy of science, Hume's problem of induction remains central[^99]. His challenge to our ability to rationally justify inductive reasoning influenced logical positivism in the twentieth century and continues to shape discussions of scientific method[^100]. Karl Popper's falsificationism can be seen as one response to Humean skepticism about induction[^101]. Contemporary epistemologists continue to grapple with Hume's arguments, with some embracing his skeptical conclusions while others seek ways to answer them[^102].

Hume's treatment of causation has been equally influential[^103]. His analysis inspired the regularity theory of causation and influenced logical empiricist approaches to scientific explanation[^104]. Contemporary debates about causation in philosophy of science, metaphysics, and statistics continue to engage with Humean themes[^105]. The development of counterfactual theories of causation and probabilistic theories can be seen as evolving responses to problems Hume first identified[^106].

In moral philosophy, Hume's sentimentalism influenced the development of emotivism and other non-cognitivist meta-ethical theories in the twentieth century[^107]. His is-ought distinction has become a foundational principle in meta-ethics, though it continues to be debated and challenged[^108]. Contemporary virtue ethics has found resources in Hume's moral psychology, particularly his account of the virtues and his naturalistic approach to ethics[^109].

Hume's philosophy of religion, particularly his critique of the argument from design, gained new relevance in debates about intelligent design and creationism[^110]. His arguments about miracles continue to be discussed in philosophy of religion and apologetics[^111]. More broadly, his naturalistic approach to religion as a human phenomenon influenced the sociology of religion and anthropological studies of religious belief[^112].

In economics, while Adam Smith is generally credited with founding modern economics, Hume's contributions were significant and influential[^113]. His monetary theory, trade theory, and political economy influenced both Smith and subsequent economists[^114]. Modern economists continue to find insights in Hume's economic writings, particularly regarding international trade and monetary policy[^115].

Hume's historiographical legacy is more complex[^116]. While his "History of England" was eventually superseded by more detailed and accurate histories, his approach to history as a philosophical and literary enterprise influenced the development of history as an academic discipline[^117]. His emphasis on analyzing underlying social and economic forces rather than merely chronicling events anticipated later historiographical approaches[^118].

Beyond academia, Hume's broader legacy includes his contribution to Enlightenment values of reason, skepticism toward authority, and religious tolerance[^119]. His life and work exemplified the possibility of living a moral and meaningful life without religious belief, a controversial proposition in his time but increasingly relevant in secularizing societies[^120].

The David Hume Institute, founded in Edinburgh in 1985, continues to promote research in economics and public policy inspired by Hume's ideas[^121]. Numerous academic journals, conferences, and scholarly societies devoted to Hume's philosophy testify to his enduring relevance[^122]. Major scholarly editions of his works and correspondence continue to appear, and the secondary literature on Hume remains vast and growing[^123].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and philosophers have long recognized Hume as one of the most important and influential thinkers in the Western philosophical tradition[^124]. A. J. Ayer, the prominent logical positivist, called Hume "the most important philosopher ever to have written in English"[^125]. Contemporary philosopher Simon Blackburn has similarly praised Hume as "the greatest philosopher to have written in English, and one of the most important in the entire European tradition"[^126].

Hume's empiricism is praised for its rigor and consistency[^127]. Supporters argue that he followed empiricist principles to their logical conclusions, revealing both the power and limitations of human knowledge in ways that earlier empiricists like Locke had not fully appreciated[^128]. His willingness to embrace skeptical conclusions rather than retreat to comfortable dogmatisms is seen as a mark of philosophical integrity[^129].

Many scholars emphasize Hume's relevance to contemporary philosophy[^130]. His naturalistic approach to philosophical questions, treating them as amenable to empirical investigation rather than pure a priori reasoning, anticipates much contemporary philosophy of mind and cognitive science[^131]. His project of understanding human nature through careful observation rather than metaphysical speculation resonates with scientifically-informed philosophy[^132].

Hume's literary style is widely admired[^133]. His ability to express complex philosophical ideas in clear, elegant prose made philosophy accessible to educated general readers and demonstrated that philosophical rigor need not come at the expense of readability[^134]. His essays in particular are regarded as models of philosophical writing[^135].

In moral philosophy, defenders of Hume emphasize the sophistication and plausibility of his sentimentalist account[^136]. Contemporary neo-Humeans in meta-ethics argue that Hume's approach better captures the motivational force of moral judgments than rationalist alternatives[^137]. His moral psychology, with its emphasis on sympathy and sentiment, is seen as more psychologically realistic than purely rationalist accounts[^138].

Scholars of the Enlightenment celebrate Hume as a crucial figure in the development of liberal, secular, and scientific culture[^139]. His skepticism toward religious dogmatism and political absolutism, combined with his defense of reason and experience as guides to knowledge, exemplified Enlightenment ideals[^140]. His influence on the Scottish Enlightenment in particular is seen as crucial to that movement's remarkable intellectual achievements[^141].

Some philosophers argue that Hume has been misunderstood and that careful reading reveals his philosophy to be less radically skeptical than commonly supposed[^142]. These "naturalistic" readings of Hume emphasize his positive program of understanding human nature rather than his skeptical conclusions[^143]. This interpretive approach has been influential in contemporary Hume scholarship[^144].

---

### Negative Views

Critics of Hume have long argued that his philosophy leads to unacceptable skeptical conclusions that undermine the possibility of knowledge[^145]. Thomas Reid and the Scottish Common Sense philosophers argued that Hume's premises, however logically rigorous, must be wrong if they lead to conclusions that contradict common sense and make ordinary knowledge impossible[^146]. This critique maintains that philosophy should respect our basic cognitive commitments rather than undermine them[^147].

Religious critics, both in Hume's time and subsequently, have condemned his philosophy as destructive of moral and religious foundations[^148]. They argue that his skepticism about religious belief and his naturalistic approach to morality remove necessary foundations for ethical life[^149]. Some religious philosophers contend that Hume's arguments against religion involve subtle fallacies or rest on questionable empiricist assumptions[^150].

Rationalist philosophers have challenged Hume's empiricist premises[^151]. They argue that Hume's restriction of knowledge to what can be derived from sensory experience is itself unjustified and that there are forms of a priori knowledge that Hume's system cannot accommodate[^152]. Kant's critical philosophy, while acknowledging Hume's importance, attempted to show that synthetic a priori knowledge is possible and necessary[^153].

Some critics argue that Hume's philosophy is self-refuting[^154]. If all meaningful ideas must be traceable to impressions, what impression corresponds to this principle itself?[^155] If we can never observe causal necessity, how can Hume make claims about what causes our beliefs?[^156] These challenges suggest internal inconsistencies in Hume's system[^157].

Feminist philosophers have criticized Hume for his neglect of gender in his philosophical system and for remarks reflecting the sexism of his era[^158]. They argue that his moral theory, despite its emphasis on sympathy, fails to adequately address issues of justice and power that are central to feminist concerns[^159]. Some contend that the very framework of his philosophy embodies masculine biases[^160].

Critics concerned with racial justice have highlighted Hume's racist statements and questioned whether these reflect deeper problems in his philosophy[^161]. While some scholars argue that these views are incidental to his philosophical system, others suggest that his empiricist method, applied in the context of European colonialism, contributed to pseudo-scientific racism[^162]. The controversy over his legacy in this regard continues[^163].

Some historians of philosophy argue that Hume's influence has been overstated or that his originality is less than commonly supposed[^164]. They point to anticipations of his ideas in earlier thinkers or suggest that his arguments are less compelling than his rhetorical skill made them appear[^165]. These revisionist assessments remain minority views but represent serious scholarly challenges to Hume's conventional status[^166].

Political critics have challenged both Hume's conservative tendencies and his philosophical undermining of political rationalism[^167]. Some argue that his skepticism about rational foundations for political authority is corrosive of democratic ideals and progressive politics[^168]. Others contend that his political views, particularly in his "History of England," reveal biases that compromise his claim to philosophical impartiality[^169].
