## Summary

Xerxes I (Old Persian: Xšayāršā), also known as Xerxes the Great, ruled the Achaemenid Persian Empire from 486 to 465 BCE, succeeding his father Darius I. He is best remembered in Western historiography for his massive invasion of Greece in 480 BCE, which included the famous battles of Thermopylae and Salamis. Despite commanding the largest military force the ancient world had ever seen, Xerxes ultimately failed to conquer Greece, marking a turning point in the Greco-Persian Wars. His reign also witnessed significant architectural achievements in Persepolis and administrative reforms throughout the empire, though his legacy remains complex and contested between Eastern and Western historical traditions.

## Early Life and Background

Xerxes I was born around 519 BCE in the royal palace complex of Persepolis, the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire[^1]. He was the son of Darius I the Great and Queen Atossa, daughter of Cyrus the Great, founder of the Persian Empire. This lineage was crucial to Xerxes' succession, as it connected him directly to the dynasty's founding bloodline through both his parents[^2]. Though Darius had older sons from previous marriages, Xerxes' maternal descent from Cyrus gave him a superior claim to the throne, a fact that Darius himself acknowledged when designating him as heir apparent around 498 BCE[^3].

As crown prince, Xerxes received an education befitting his future role as King of Kings. Persian royal education emphasized physical training, horsemanship, archery, and the Zoroastrian religion that undergirded the empire's ideological framework[^4]. Ancient sources suggest that Xerxes was trained in the arts of warfare and statecraft alongside the sons of noble Persian families, creating bonds that would later serve him as king. He also learned to read and write Old Persian cuneiform, as evidenced by inscriptions he later commissioned[^5].

During his father's reign, Xerxes served as viceroy of Babylon, one of the empire's most important satrapies, from approximately 498 BCE until his accession[^6]. This experience provided him with crucial administrative knowledge and familiarity with the diverse peoples and cultures under Persian rule. The vast Achaemenid Empire stretched from the Indus Valley to Libya and from Central Asia to the Indian Ocean, encompassing dozens of ethnic groups, languages, and religious traditions. Managing this diversity would become one of the central challenges of Xerxes' reign[^7].

The young prince also witnessed his father's military campaigns, including the first Persian invasion of Greece in 492-490 BCE, which ended in defeat at Marathon[^8]. This formative experience likely influenced Xerxes' later determination to complete his father's unfinished conquest of the Greek city-states. When Darius died in 486 BCE while preparing another Greek expedition, Xerxes inherited not only an empire but also an unfulfilled mission that would define his reign[^9].

## Rise to Power

Xerxes' accession to the throne in October 486 BCE was not entirely uncontested, despite his designation as heir[^10]. According to the Greek historian Herodotus, there was debate within the royal court about the succession, with some supporting Xerxes' older half-brother Artobazanes, who argued that his seniority by birth should take precedence[^11]. However, Xerxes countered that he was "the first-born son of Darius' marriage after he became king" and, more importantly, descended from Cyrus through his mother Atossa[^12]. This argument, possibly supported by Atossa's considerable influence at court, secured his position.

The new king's first challenge came almost immediately. Egypt, which Darius had conquered in 525 BCE, erupted in rebellion shortly before or after Darius' death, taking advantage of the transition period[^13]. Xerxes responded decisively and ruthlessly. In 484 BCE, he personally led the Persian army to Egypt and crushed the revolt within a year. Unlike his predecessors who had adopted the title of Pharaoh and respected Egyptian religious traditions, Xerxes imposed harsh measures on Egypt, removing many of the privileges the province had enjoyed and installing his brother Achaemenes as satrap with a strong military garrison[^14]. This marked a shift toward a more authoritarian approach to imperial governance.

A second major rebellion occurred in Babylon in 484-482 BCE, where two successive rebel kings proclaimed themselves rulers[^15]. Xerxes' response was even more severe than in Egypt. After suppressing the revolt, he ordered the destruction of Babylon's temples, melted down the golden statue of Marduk (the city's patron deity), and removed the title "King of Babylon" from his official titulature[^16]. This dramatic break with his predecessors' policy of religious tolerance demonstrated Xerxes' willingness to use force and cultural suppression to maintain imperial unity, though some modern scholars question whether the destruction was as complete as ancient sources suggest[^17].

These early crises established Xerxes' authority and demonstrated his military capability, but they also delayed his inherited mission to punish Greece for its role in supporting the Ionian Revolt and defeating Persian forces at Marathon[^18]. By 483 BCE, with internal stability restored, Xerxes began assembling an enormous military force for the invasion that would become the defining event of his reign. Ancient sources describe years of preparation, with resources drawn from across the empire to create an army and navy of unprecedented size[^19].

## Major Achievements

### The Greek Expedition

Xerxes' invasion of Greece in 480 BCE was the largest military operation in ancient history up to that time[^20]. Herodotus famously claimed the Persian force numbered over 2.6 million fighting men plus support personnel, though modern historians estimate the actual force at between 200,000 to 300,000 soldiers and perhaps 600-800 warships[^21]. Even these revised figures represent an extraordinary logistical achievement. The king ordered the construction of two pontoon bridges across the Hellespont (modern Dardanelles), each over a mile long, and a canal cut through the Athos peninsula to allow his fleet safe passage[^22].

The expedition began with significant successes. The Persian army advanced through Thrace and Macedonia into northern Greece, while the navy moved parallel along the coast[^23]. At Thermopylae in August 480 BCE, Xerxes faced a Greek defensive force led by Spartan King Leonidas. After three days of fierce fighting and only after a Greek traitor revealed a mountain path that allowed the Persians to outflank the defenders, the pass fell and Leonidas died with his 300 Spartans and other Greeks[^24]. Xerxes then advanced into central Greece, capturing and burning Athens, whose population had evacuated to Salamis and the Peloponnese[^25].

However, the campaign's turning point came at the naval Battle of Salamis in September 480 BCE[^26]. The Greek fleet, led by the Athenian Themistocles, lured the larger Persian navy into the narrow straits between Salamis and the mainland. In the confined waters, the Persian numerical advantage became a liability, as their ships crowded together and could not maneuver effectively[^27]. The Greeks destroyed approximately 200 Persian vessels while losing only 40 of their own, forcing Xerxes to withdraw the remainder of his fleet to Asia Minor[^28]. According to Herodotus, Xerxes watched the battle from a throne on a nearby hilltop, witnessing the destruction of his maritime power[^29].

Though Xerxes left a substantial land force in Greece under his general Mardonius and returned to Persia, the campaign effectively ended the following year when the Greeks destroyed this army at Plataea and the remaining Persian fleet at Mycale[^30]. The invasion's failure had profound consequences, halting Persian westward expansion and preserving Greek independence, which many historians consider crucial for the later development of Western civilization[^31].

### Architectural Legacy

Despite the Greek expedition's failure, Xerxes was an accomplished builder who left a significant architectural legacy[^32]. He continued and expanded the construction projects his father had begun at Persepolis, the ceremonial capital. His most notable contribution was the Gate of All Nations (also called the Gate of Xerxes), a grand entrance to the terrace complex adorned with massive lamassu (human-headed winged bulls) in the Assyrian style[^33]. Inscriptions on the gate proclaimed in Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian: "By the favor of Ahuramazda, I built this gateway. Much else that is beautiful was built within this [city of] Parsa, which I built and my father built"[^34].

Xerxes also completed the Apadana (audience hall) begun by Darius, a massive structure with 72 stone columns, each 65 feet tall, supporting a wooden roof[^35]. The hall could accommodate 10,000 people and served as the setting for the New Year festival and other state ceremonies where subject peoples brought tribute to the King of Kings[^36]. The intricate relief sculptures decorating the staircases, depicting representatives of the empire's 23 subject nations in their distinctive dress bearing gifts, illustrate the diversity and extent of Xerxes' domain[^37].

At Susa, another major Persian capital, Xerxes built a magnificent palace complex[^38]. An inscription found at the site describes how materials and craftsmen were brought from across the empire: cedar from Lebanon, gold from Sardis and Bactria, lapis lazuli from Sogdiana, turquoise from Chorasmia, silver and ebony from Egypt, ivory from Ethiopia and India[^39]. This inscription reveals both the economic integration of the empire and Xerxes' desire to display its wealth and power through monumental architecture.

### Administrative Reforms

While less celebrated than his military campaigns or building projects, Xerxes made significant administrative contributions to the empire's governance[^40]. He refined the satrapal system established by his predecessors, clarifying the relationship between civil governors (satraps) and military commanders to prevent any single official from accumulating too much power[^41]. He also strengthened the inspection system, employing "the King's Eyes and Ears" to monitor provincial officials and report directly to the royal court[^42].

Xerxes continued developing the royal road system that facilitated communication and trade across the empire's vast distances[^43]. The main royal road ran from Susa to Sardis, covering approximately 1,600 miles, with posting stations every 15 miles providing fresh horses for royal messengers[^44]. This infrastructure enabled messages to travel the entire distance in about a week, a remarkable achievement that Herodotus noted with admiration[^45].

The king also standardized taxation and tribute collection, maintaining detailed records of what each province owed to the imperial treasury[^46]. Herodotus preserved a list showing annual tribute from each satrapy, ranging from 360 talents of silver from Egypt to 170 talents from the Medes[^47]. This systematic approach to imperial finance helped sustain the empire's military forces and construction projects.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Treatment of Conquered Peoples

Xerxes' harsh suppression of rebellions in Egypt and Babylon marked a departure from the relatively tolerant policy of his predecessors and generated significant criticism, both in ancient times and among modern historians[^48]. Cyrus the Great and Darius I had generally respected local customs, religions, and power structures, presenting themselves as legitimate rulers within each conquered culture's framework—as King of Babylon, Pharaoh of Egypt, etc.[^49]. Xerxes' destruction of Babylonian temples and removal of the Marduk statue represented a dramatic break with this approach, transforming Babylon from a privileged second capital into a subjugated province[^50].

Some ancient Greek sources, though hostile to Persia generally, specifically criticized Xerxes as more despotic and cruel than his predecessors[^51]. The desecration of Greek temples, particularly the burning of the Acropolis in Athens, was portrayed as sacrilege that violated even the customs of warfare[^52]. Modern scholars debate whether Xerxes was genuinely more intolerant than earlier Persian kings or whether Greek propaganda exaggerated his actions, but the suppression of Babylon's religious institutions appears well-documented in both Greek and Babylonian sources[^53].

### Strategic and Military Failures

Despite commanding unprecedented resources, Xerxes' Greek expedition ended in costly failure, and his role in that failure has been extensively debated[^54]. Ancient Greek sources often portray him as arrogant, impulsive, and prone to displays of hubris, such as ordering the Hellespont whipped and branded when storms destroyed his first pontoon bridges[^55]. While such stories may be embellished propaganda, the strategic decisions Xerxes made during the campaign have faced legitimate criticism from military historians.

The decision to fight at Salamis, rather than bypassing the Greek fleet and advancing directly on the Peloponnese by land, proved disastrous[^56]. Some sources suggest Xerxes was manipulated by Themistocles through a false message claiming dissension among the Greek allies, but this may excuse what was fundamentally a strategic error[^57]. After Salamis, Xerxes' decision to return to Persia while leaving Mardonius with the land army has been interpreted as either prudent caution or abandonment of his forces[^58].

More broadly, some historians argue that the entire Greek expedition was a strategic mistake that diverted resources from more pressing challenges within the empire and on its eastern frontiers[^59]. The expedition's failure damaged Persian military prestige and encouraged further Greek aggression, including the Delian League's later attacks on Persian territories in Asia Minor[^60].

### Allegations of Tyranny and Excess

Ancient sources frequently characterize Xerxes as the archetypal eastern despot, living in luxury while exercising absolute and often capricious power[^61]. The Greek playwright Aeschylus, in his tragedy "The Persians" performed just eight years after Salamis, depicts Xerxes as having brought disaster through overreaching ambition and hybris[^62]. Later Greek historians elaborated on themes of Persian decadence and despotism, contrasting them with Greek freedom and moderation[^63].

The murder of Xerxes by the commander of his guard, Artabanus, in 465 BCE may suggest discontent within the court itself, though the sources on his assassination are fragmentary and unreliable[^64]. Some later Persian and Greek sources claim Xerxes had become increasingly paranoid and withdrawn in his final years, concerned more with harem intrigues than governance, but these accounts may reflect stock tropes about oriental monarchs rather than historical reality[^65].

### Historical Bias and Orientalism

Modern scholars increasingly recognize that much of the negative portrayal of Xerxes stems from Greek sources written by his enemies, which formed the basis for later Western historiography[^66]. The Greek-Persian Wars became a foundational myth in Western civilization, cast as a struggle between freedom and tyranny, West and East, civilization and barbarism[^67]. Xerxes served as the emblematic "barbarian king" in this narrative, his defeat validating Greek cultural superiority[^68].

Persian sources on Xerxes are limited and mostly inscriptional, but they present a very different image: a pious Zoroastrian king who ruled with divine favor, built magnificent monuments, and maintained the empire his ancestors had created[^69]. The absence of extensive Persian literary sources means Western understanding of Xerxes remained dominated by the Greek perspective until archaeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries began providing material evidence from Persian sites[^70]. Even today, popular culture depictions of Xerxes, such as in the film "300," perpetuate orientalist stereotypes rather than balanced historical assessment[^71].

---

## Personal Life

Xerxes' family life was typical of Persian royalty, characterized by multiple marriages designed to cement political alliances and produce heirs[^72]. His principal wife was Amestris, daughter of a Persian nobleman named Otanes[^73]. Ancient sources describe Amestris as a powerful and sometimes ruthless figure in the royal court, exercising significant influence over her husband and, after his death, serving as queen mother during their son Artaxerxes' reign[^74]. Herodotus relates several disturbing stories about Amestris' cruelty, including having a rival mutilated, though these tales may reflect Greek stereotypes about Persian royal women rather than historical fact[^75].

Xerxes and Amestris had at least four sons: Darius (the eldest and initially designated heir), Hystaspes, Artaxerxes (who would eventually succeed as Artaxerxes I), and Achaemenes[^76]. The king also had children with several other wives and concubines, as was customary for Persian monarchs[^77]. This polygamous household would later contribute to succession conflicts after Xerxes' death, when court intrigue and assassinations determined which son would inherit the throne[^78].

The Greek historian Herodotus includes several anecdotes about Xerxes' personal character and private behavior, though their reliability is questionable[^79]. One story describes Xerxes falling in love with his brother Masistes' wife and, when she rejected him, arranging for his own daughter to marry Masistes' son, allowing him access to the household where he seduced the younger woman instead[^80]. When Queen Amestris discovered the affair, she allegedly had Masistes' wife brutally mutilated, causing Masistes to rebel—a revolt Xerxes suppressed by having his brother assassinated[^81]. While such stories may be Greek propaganda intended to portray Persian court life as morally degenerate, they became part of Xerxes' traditional image in Western literature.

More reliable sources indicate Xerxes was a devoted Zoroastrian who considered himself Ahura Mazda's chosen ruler on earth[^82]. His inscriptions frequently invoke the supreme deity and emphasize his role in promoting truth (asha) and suppressing the lie (druj)[^83]. One controversial inscription, the "Daiva inscription," describes how Xerxes destroyed sanctuaries where daivas (demons or false gods) were worshipped and established worship of Ahura Mazda instead[^84]. Scholars debate whether this refers to the destruction of Babylonian temples or represents a general policy statement, but it clearly indicates Xerxes' religious convictions[^85].

Contemporary descriptions of Xerxes' physical appearance are limited, but he was reportedly tall and handsome, fitting the Persian ideal of royal bearing[^86]. Relief sculptures at Persepolis depict him in the formal Persian court style, with elaborately curled beard and hair, wearing the royal robe and carrying a staff and lotus blossom as symbols of authority[^87]. These idealized representations emphasize majesty and divine favor rather than individual personality or realistic portraiture.

## Legacy

### Impact on the Greek World

Paradoxically, Xerxes' failed invasion of Greece may have been his most consequential legacy, though not in the way he intended[^88]. The Persian threat united many Greek city-states for the first time, leading to unprecedented cooperation between traditional rivals like Athens and Sparta[^89]. The victories at Salamis and Plataea became defining moments in Greek cultural identity, celebrated in literature, art, and political rhetoric for centuries[^90].

The successful Greek defense also enabled Athens' rise as a major power, as the city's leading role in the naval victory at Salamis justified its dominance of the Delian League, an alliance that transformed into an Athenian empire[^91]. The wealth flowing to Athens from this empire funded the construction of the Parthenon and supported the cultural flowering of the fifth century BCE that produced Pericles, Socrates, the great tragedians, and the foundations of Western philosophy and democracy[^92]. Thus, Xerxes' defeat indirectly contributed to the Classical Greek achievements that profoundly influenced Western civilization[^93].

The Greco-Persian Wars also established enduring cultural paradigms contrasting East and West, freedom and despotism, that continue to influence geopolitical thinking[^94]. The wars became a foundational myth of European identity, invoked during later conflicts from the Crusades to modern times whenever Western powers faced Eastern opponents[^95].

### Within Persian History

Within the Persian imperial tradition, Xerxes occupies a more complex position[^96]. While he failed to expand the empire westward, he maintained its vast territories from India to Libya throughout his 21-year reign, no small achievement given the empire's size and diversity[^97]. His architectural contributions, particularly at Persepolis, created monuments that survived millennia and remain symbols of Persian cultural achievement[^98].

Later Persian sources, including the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) compiled in the 10th century CE, preserve some traditions about Xerxes (identified with the character Khshayarsha), though with significant legendary embellishment[^99]. In this Persian epic tradition, he appears as a complex figure, neither purely heroic nor villainous, reflecting the historical memory of a powerful king whose reign had both successes and failures[^100].

The Achaemenid Empire Xerxes helped maintain provided a model for later Iranian empires, including the Parthian and Sasanian dynasties[^101]. The concept of the King of Kings ruling over diverse peoples while respecting their customs (despite Xerxes' own departures from this ideal) became a persistent feature of Iranian political culture[^102]. Modern Iran's pre-revolutionary government explicitly connected itself to the Achaemenid heritage, celebrating the empire's achievements and promoting Persepolis as a national symbol[^103].

### Archaeological Rediscovery

The 19th and 20th-century archaeological excavation of Persian sites dramatically changed understanding of Xerxes and the Achaemenid Empire[^104]. Excavations at Persepolis, beginning in the 1930s under Ernst Herzfeld and Erich Schmidt, uncovered thousands of administrative tablets, monumental architecture, and inscriptions that provided Persian perspectives to complement Greek literary sources[^105]. These discoveries revealed a sophisticated imperial administration, advanced artistic traditions, and religious ideology that challenged simplistic Western stereotypes about Persian "barbarism"[^106].

Xerxes' inscriptions, written in Old Persian cuneiform, Elamite, and Babylonian, demonstrated the multilingual character of the empire and the king's concern with legitimacy and divine favor[^107]. The Persepolis Fortification Tablets, administrative documents from Xerxes' reign, illuminated daily life, economic organization, and the roles of women in ways Greek sources never addressed[^108]. This material evidence has enabled more balanced assessment of Xerxes' reign beyond the Greek narrative of tyranny and excess.

### Modern Cultural Reception

Xerxes remains a figure of fascination in modern popular culture, though often portrayed through the lens of Greek sources and Orientalist stereotypes[^109]. The 2006 film "300," based on Frank Miller's graphic novel about the Battle of Thermopylae, depicts Xerxes as a bizarre, decadent, almost supernatural figure, perpetuating ancient Greek propaganda rather than engaging with historical evidence[^110]. Such portrayals have been criticized by Iranian scholars and cultural commentators as offensive distortions that continue colonialist traditions of representing Eastern peoples as barbaric and other[^111].

More serious historical treatments, including scholarly biographies and documentaries, have attempted to present more nuanced portraits that acknowledge both Persian and Greek perspectives[^112]. Xerxes increasingly appears in these works as a capable administrator and builder who inherited an enormous empire, maintained it successfully for two decades, but failed in his attempt to expand westward against a determined Greek resistance[^113]. This more balanced view recognizes him as neither the god-like figure of Persian royal ideology nor the tyrannical monster of Greek propaganda, but rather a complex historical figure whose actions shaped the ancient world in profound and lasting ways.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars increasingly recognize Xerxes' considerable achievements as an administrator and builder, despite the overshadowing failure of his Greek expedition[^114]. Amélie Kuhrt, a leading historian of the Achaemenid Empire, argues that Xerxes successfully maintained one of history's largest and most diverse empires for over two decades, a significant accomplishment that required sophisticated administrative skills and effective military force[^115]. The satrapal system he refined continued to function effectively for another century, suggesting sound institutional development rather than mere despotic rule[^116].

Pierre Briant, another prominent Achaemenidologist, emphasizes Xerxes' architectural legacy and its significance for understanding Persian imperial ideology[^117]. The completion of Persepolis, particularly the Apadana and Gate of All Nations, created a ceremonial setting that visually expressed the empire's multiethnic character and the king's role as divinely appointed ruler of diverse peoples[^118]. These monuments demonstrate aesthetic sophistication and technical skill that challenge Greek-derived stereotypes about Persian cultural inferiority[^119].

Scholars of ancient Iranian religion note Xerxes' inscriptions as important sources for understanding Achaemenid Zoroastrianism and royal ideology[^120]. His invocations of Ahura Mazda and emphasis on supporting truth against falsehood reveal a coherent religious worldview that legitimized his authority and provided ethical framework for governance[^121]. The controversial Daiva inscription, whatever its precise referent, shows Xerxes' commitment to promoting what he considered true religion, an impulse not different in kind from later monotheistic rulers[^122].

Some military historians, while acknowledging the Greek expedition's failure, note the extraordinary logistical achievement it represented[^123]. Assembling, supplying, and moving hundreds of thousands of soldiers across two continents, constructing the Hellespont bridges and Athos canal, and coordinating land and naval forces demonstrated organizational capacity unmatched in the ancient world[^124]. That such an effort ultimately failed speaks to Greek military effectiveness and geographic advantages rather than solely Persian incompetence[^125].

Iranian scholars and nationalists view Xerxes more positively than Western historiography traditionally has, seeing him as an Iranian king who defended and expanded Persian power against foreign enemies[^126]. In this perspective, the Greek expedition was a legitimate response to Greek interference in the Ionian Revolt and Greek raids on Persian territory, not unprovoked aggression[^127]. The burning of Athens appears in this context as conventional ancient warfare rather than exceptional barbarity, especially given that the Athenians had previously burned Sardis[^128].

### Negative Views

Despite revisionist scholarly efforts, many historians continue to view Xerxes as a fundamentally flawed ruler whose reign marked the beginning of Achaemenid decline[^129]. Tom Holland, in his popular history "Persian Fire," portrays Xerxes as arrogant and overconfident, launching an ill-conceived invasion driven more by personal pride than strategic necessity[^130]. The massive expenditure of resources on the Greek expedition, which ended in complete failure, weakened the empire and encouraged rebellions and secessions in the following decades[^131].

Classical scholars who focus primarily on Greek sources often accept substantial elements of the Greek characterization of Xerxes as a tyrant[^132]. The suppression of Babylon and Egypt, the destruction of Greek temples, and the stories of cruel punishments (whether entirely accurate or not) suggest a ruler who relied heavily on force and terror to maintain control[^133]. Even if we discount some Greek propaganda, the departure from Cyrus and Darius' more conciliatory approach toward conquered peoples appears historically substantiated and marked a negative shift in imperial policy[^134].

Military historians critical of Xerxes emphasize his strategic and tactical errors during the Greek campaign[^135]. John Keegan notes that dividing his forces after Salamis—returning to Persia himself while leaving Mardonius with the army—created a command problem that contributed to defeat at Plataea[^136]. The decision to fight at Salamis, whether based on faulty intelligence or overconfidence, was a catastrophic error that destroyed Persian naval power and made the entire expedition untenable[^137].

Some scholars argue that Xerxes' religious policies, particularly regarding Babylon, were counterproductive and damaged the empire's stability[^138]. The Achaemenid Empire's success had been built on religious tolerance and respect for local traditions; Xerxes' destruction of Babylonian temples and removal of Marduk's statue violated this principle and created lasting resentment in one of the empire's most important provinces[^139]. This intolerance, some argue, set a precedent that weakened the imperial system's ideological foundations[^140].

The circumstances of Xerxes' death—assassination by his own guard commander—suggest dissatisfaction within the court itself and possible failures of leadership in his later years[^141]. While details are uncertain, the court intrigue and succession crisis that followed his murder indicate instability that may have developed during his reign[^142]. Some ancient sources claim he became increasingly withdrawn and focused on harem intrigues rather than governance, allowing corrupt officials and conspirators to flourish, though these characterizations may reflect topoi rather than fact[^143].

Contemporary critics of orientalism and Western bias in ancient history note that while much anti-Xerxes material is indeed Greek propaganda, the impulse to rehabilitate his reputation sometimes goes too far in the opposite direction, minimizing real failures and problematic policies in an overcorrection against Western bias[^144]. A balanced assessment, they argue, must acknowledge both the limitations of Greek sources and the evidence for genuine strategic mistakes and harsh policies that Xerxes implemented[^145].
