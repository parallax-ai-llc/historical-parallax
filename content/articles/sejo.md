## Summary

Sejo (born November 2, 1417; died September 23, 1468) was the 7th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1455 to 1468.[^1] Originally **Grand Prince Suyang**, the second son of King Sejong, he is one of the most controversial figures in Korean history. A talented and ambitious leader, he seized the throne from his young nephew **Danjong** in a bloody coup known as the **Gyeyu Jeongnan**. While his reign strengthened the monarchy and produced the **Gyeongguk Daejeon** (law code), his legacy is stained by the usurpation and the ruthless execution of the **Six Martyred Ministers** (Sayuksin).[^2]

## The Usurper (Gyeyu Jeongnan)

In 1453, Grand Prince Suyang launched a coup to eliminate the powerful ministers (like Kim Jong-seo) who were protecting the young King Danjong.
*   **The Kill List:** Suyang personally oversaw the bludgeoning of his political rivals. He then became the Chief State Councilor, effectively ruling the country.
*   **Accession:** In 1455, he pressured Danjong to abdicate and declared himself King Sejo.[^3]

## The Six Martyred Ministers (Sayuksin)

In 1456, a group of loyal officials (including Seong Sam-mun and Pak Paeng-nyeon) plotted to assassinate Sejo and restore Danjong.
*   **Betrayal and Torture:** The plot was leaked. Sejo personally interrogated and tortured the conspirators with burning irons. They refused to call him "King," addressing him only as "Your Highness" (Prince). They were all executed and dismembered.
*   **Danjong's Death:** Fearing further rebellions, Sejo demoted Danjong to a commoner and eventually ordered his death by poison in 1457.[^4]

## Achievements and Reforms

Despite his bloody path to power, Sejo was a capable administrator.
*   **Strengthening Royal Power:** He abolished the State Council's power to make decisions, centralizing all authority in the King (6-Ministries Direct Rule System).
*   **Gyeongguk Daejeon:** He ordered the compilation of the **National Code**, the first written constitution of Joseon, establishing the rule of law.
*   **Land Reform:** He implemented the **Jikjeon Law**, reducing the land grants to officials to secure state revenue.[^5]

## Buddhism and Later Years

Suffering from a painful skin disease (which legend says was a curse from Danjong's mother), Sejo turned to Buddhism for solace.
*   **Wongaksa Temple:** He built the Wongaksa Temple (now Tapgol Park) in Seoul, showing rare royal support for Buddhism in a Confucian state.[^6]
