## Summary

Tikhon of Zadonsk was a Russian Orthodox bishop and theologian who is considered one of the greatest spiritual writers of the Russian Church. His works on Christian living deeply influenced Dostoevsky, who modeled the Elder Zosima in The Brothers Karamazov partly on Tikhon. He resigned his bishopric to live in monastic retirement, dedicating his final years to writing and charity.
