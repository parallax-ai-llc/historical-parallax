## Summary

Dipa Ma (Nani Bala Barua) was a Bangladeshi Buddhist meditation master who became one of the most important female meditation teachers of the 20th century. After devastating personal losses, she began intensive meditation practice and quickly attained deep states of insight. She taught vipassana meditation in Calcutta and was a major influence on Western meditation teachers including Sharon Salzberg and Jack Kornfield.
