## Summary

Joseph Le Bel was a French chemist who independently proposed, simultaneously with Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff, the tetrahedral arrangement of carbon bonds in 1874. This concept of stereochemistry explained optical isomerism and was fundamental to understanding three-dimensional molecular structure in organic chemistry.
