## Early Life and Background

David Packard was born on September 7, 1912, in Pueblo, Colorado, to Sperry Sidney Packard, a lawyer, and Ella Graber Packard, a high school teacher.[^5] Growing up in the Rocky Mountain region during the early 20th century, young David displayed an early fascination with science and engineering that would shape his entire career. He avidly read library books on science and electricity as a boy and built his first radio while still in elementary school, demonstrating the hands-on curiosity that would later define his approach to business and innovation.[^6]

At Centennial High School in Pueblo, the six-foot-five Packard stood out both physically and intellectually. He excelled academically while simultaneously demonstrating remarkable athletic prowess, lettering in football, basketball, and track.[^7] This combination of intellectual rigor and physical discipline would later inform his holistic approach to business management, where he valued both mental acuity and practical, hands-on problem-solving.

In 1930, Packard began his freshman year at Stanford University, a decision that would prove pivotal not just for his own life but for the entire technology industry.[^8] At Stanford, he pursued electrical engineering while continuing his athletic achievements, earning letters in both football and basketball. More importantly, he attained membership in the prestigious Phi Beta Kappa society and joined the Alpha Delta Phi Literary Fraternity.[^9] During his time at Stanford, Packard met two people who would profoundly influence his life: Lucile Salter, whom he would later marry, and Bill Hewlett, his future business partner.[^10]

Stanford is where Packard first encountered Fred Terman, the legendary engineering professor who would become known as the "father of Silicon Valley." Terman encouraged his students to start their own companies rather than seeking employment with established East Coast firms, planting the seeds for what would become the Silicon Valley entrepreneurial culture.[^11] After graduating with his B.A. in 1934, Packard briefly attended the University of Colorado at Boulder before accepting a position with General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York.[^12] However, the pull of the West Coast and Terman's influence proved strong, and in 1938, Packard returned to Stanford, where he earned a master's degree in electrical engineering later that year.[^13]

## Rise to Power

The founding story of Hewlett-Packard has become Silicon Valley legend, embodying the entrepreneurial spirit that would define the region for generations. In 1938, encouraged by their former professor Fred Terman, David Packard and Bill Hewlett began part-time work in a rented garage at 367 Addison Avenue in Palo Alto with an initial capital investment of just $538.[^14] That modest garage, which Packard and his new wife Lucile lived beside, would later be designated California Historical Landmark No. 976 and officially declared the "Birthplace of Silicon Valley."[^15]

The partnership between Hewlett and Packard was formalized in 1939, and the company name itself was decided by a coin toss—Hewlett won, but graciously insisted the company be called Hewlett-Packard rather than Packard-Hewlett.[^16] Their first successful product, a resistance-tuned audio frequency oscillator (the Model 200A), demonstrated both technical innovation and business acumen. The device was more advanced yet less expensive than competing products, establishing a pattern that would define HP's competitive strategy.[^17] Their early success came when Walt Disney Studios purchased eight oscillators to test sound equipment for the groundbreaking animated film "Fantasia," providing both revenue and validation for their technology.[^18]

World War II proved a crucial period for HP's growth. The company received numerous government contracts to produce vital electronic equipment for the war effort, and under Packard's wartime management, Hewlett-Packard was awarded the government's "E" for Efficiency honors on four different occasions.[^19] This wartime expansion taught Packard valuable lessons about scaling production, managing rapid growth, and maintaining quality under pressure—lessons that would serve the company well in the decades to come.

HP was officially incorporated on August 18, 1947, with Packard assuming the role of president. Under his leadership, the company experienced explosive growth: sales reached $5.5 million in 1951 with 215 employees, a dramatic increase from the two-person operation that had started in a garage just over a decade earlier.[^20] Packard would serve in various leadership roles throughout his career with HP: president (1947-64), CEO (1964-68), and chairman of the board (1964-68, 1972-93).[^21]

What truly set HP apart, however, was not just its technical innovations but Packard's revolutionary approach to management. In the 1950s and 1960s, when most American corporations operated under hierarchical, command-and-control structures, Packard pioneered what became known as the "HP Way."[^22] This progressive business philosophy emphasized trust and respect for individuals, focus on high achievement and contribution, and conducting business with uncompromising integrity.[^23] Packard literally broke down walls separating top management from employees, abandoned traditional CEO offices, adopted an open-door policy, and introduced "management by walking around" (MBWA)—casual, unplanned visits with employees at all levels.[^24]

## Major Achievements

David Packard's achievements span business innovation, technological advancement, government service, and philanthropy, making him one of the most influential figures in 20th-century American life.

**Building Hewlett-Packard into a Technology Giant**: Perhaps Packard's most visible achievement was transforming HP from a $538 startup into one of the world's premier technology companies. By the time of his death in 1996, HP had grown to $31 billion in revenues, employed tens of thousands of people worldwide, and stood at the forefront of the computer revolution.[^25] The company pioneered numerous technologies, including scientific calculators, desktop computers, laser printers, and medical instrumentation. Under Packard's leadership, HP became known not just for innovation but for reliability and quality—attributes that reflected his engineering background and personal values.

**Revolutionizing Corporate Management Philosophy**: The "HP Way" may be Packard's most enduring contribution to American business. As Packard himself once said, his most important contribution was his management style.[^26] In a 1960 address to HP managers, Packard articulated a philosophy that challenged prevailing corporate wisdom: "Many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money." Instead, Packard argued that profit was not the proper end and aim of management but rather "what makes all of the proper ends and aims possible."[^27] He believed that people get together as a company to accomplish something collectively which they could not accomplish separately.[^28]

This philosophy manifested in concrete practices. Packard championed "management by objective" as opposed to "management by control," giving people flexibility to work toward clearly stated goals in ways they determined best for their own areas of responsibility.[^29] During the 1970 recession, rather than laying off workers, HP reduced everyone's schedule and pay by ten percent for six months, thereby reducing labor costs without firing ten percent of the workforce.[^30] This decision reflected Packard's belief in the company's responsibility to recognize the dignity of employees as human beings, not merely as economic resources.[^31] The HP Way was copied across Silicon Valley, with other companies imitating Packard's style and helping to create the distinctive corporate culture that characterized the region.[^32]

**Government Service and Defense Innovation**: From 1969 to 1971, Packard served as the 13th Deputy Secretary of Defense under President Richard Nixon, with Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird.[^33] Taking the position meant reducing his salary from nearly a million dollars a year to about $30,000, a sacrifice that demonstrated his commitment to public service.[^34] While Laird concentrated on winning Pentagon battles on Capitol Hill, Packard managed the Defense Department, bringing concepts of resource management used in business to the military and establishing the Defense Systems Management College.[^35]

Packard's influence on defense policy extended beyond his formal tenure. During the Reagan Administration, he chaired the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management (commonly known as the Packard Commission), created to study administration and procurement within the Department of Defense.[^36] The commission's recommendations led to significant reforms in how the military acquired and managed weapons systems, applying private-sector efficiency principles to government operations.

**Philanthropic Leadership**: David and Lucile Packard founded the David and Lucile Packard Foundation in 1964 with a $100,000 endowment.[^37] Following David Packard's death in 1996, the Foundation became the beneficiary of approximately $4 billion from his estate, adding to the assets Lucile had bequeathed when she died in 1987.[^38] Today, with over $8 billion in assets and hundreds of millions in annual grantmaking, it ranks among the largest philanthropies in the United States.[^39]

The foundation's goals are to "improve the lives of children, enable creative pursuit of science, advance reproductive health, and conserve and restore earth's natural systems."[^40] In 2017 alone, the Foundation made 1,227 grants to various organizations.[^41] Major philanthropic initiatives include the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), founded by Packard in 1987, which has discovered more than 250 marine species and advanced ocean exploration technology.[^42] In 1986, David and Lucile donated $40 million (later increased to $70 million) toward building the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University, which opened in 1991 and has become one of the nation's premier pediatric facilities.[^43]

**Recognition and Honors**: Packard received numerous prestigious awards throughout his career. In 1988, he was awarded both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Medal of Technology.[^44] He and Hewlett jointly received the 1973 IEEE Founders Medal and were inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1988.[^45] In 1997, Packard received the Heinz Award Chairman's Medal along with William R. Hewlett.[^46] He also received honorary degrees from Colorado College, the University of California, Pepperdine University, the University of Notre Dame, and Catholic University.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his many achievements, David Packard's career was not without significant controversies and criticisms, particularly regarding conflicts of interest, political associations, and business decisions with ethical implications.

**Pentagon Conflict of Interest Controversy**: Packard's appointment as Deputy Secretary of Defense in 1969 immediately sparked fierce controversy. Congressional critics pointed out that Packard owned approximately one-third of the stock in Hewlett-Packard, a company doing about $100 million annually in defense-related business.[^48] The nomination came at the height of the Vietnam War, and many members of Congress complained that Packard's wealth and financial interest in HP represented a major conflict of interest that could influence defense procurement decisions in ways that would benefit his company.[^49]

To address these concerns, Packard placed nearly $300 million worth of Hewlett-Packard shares into a charitable trust, with the annual income of nearly $700,000 from those shares distributed to various charitable and educational institutions.[^50] During his Congressional confirmation hearing, Packard made a dramatic pledge: "The day I quit the Pentagon my Hewlett-Packard stock will not be worth one cent more than it was the day I walked in," offering to donate 100% of any gains in his HP stock that occurred during his term to charity.[^51] While this arrangement satisfied enough senators for confirmation, critics argued that the structural conflict remained, as Packard could still benefit from decisions that helped the broader electronics industry.

**Vietnam War-Era Criticism and Student Protests**: Working for the Defense Department during the Vietnam War years subjected Packard to intense criticism from politicians, media, and especially student activists.[^52] At Stanford University, students protested that the university was affiliated with a firm that profited from war by selling instrumentation used in bomber planes over Vietnam.[^53] Packard was often vilified by student protesters who saw him as emblematic of the "military-industrial complex" that President Eisenhower had warned against. These protests reflected broader societal divisions over the war and raised questions about the ethical responsibilities of technology companies whose products could be used for both civilian and military purposes.

**South Africa Apartheid Controversy**: Perhaps the most damaging ethical criticism of Packard's business career involved HP's expansion into apartheid-era South Africa. Packard was criticized for expanding HP's operations in South Africa, where the company's equipment was used to implement and enforce the apartheid system of racial segregation.[^54] In 1980, Packard personally presided over the groundbreaking ceremony for HP's headquarters in Johannesburg, a highly symbolic act that seemed to endorse the regime's legitimacy at a time when international opposition to apartheid was mounting.[^55]

When Nebraska became the first U.S. state government to divest from companies doing business in South Africa as part of the anti-apartheid movement, Packard's response revealed his priorities: "I'd rather lose business in Nebraska than with South Africa."[^56] This statement, which prioritized corporate profits over human rights concerns, drew sharp criticism from civil rights activists and damaged Packard's reputation as a socially responsible businessman. Critics argued that a man who preached about corporate responsibility to employees seemed willing to overlook state-sanctioned racial oppression when profits were at stake.

**Conservative Political Activities**: As a lifelong conservative Republican and staunch advocate of free-market capitalism, Packard was a leading donor to Republican presidential campaigns, including those of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush.[^57] He served as an elector for President Richard Nixon in 1972 and became part of President Gerald Ford's "kitchen cabinet" or informal advisers.[^58] In August 1975, Packard went half-time at Hewlett-Packard to serve as finance chairman of President Ford's 1976 re-election campaign.[^59]

Packard was also a trustee of the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research organization.[^60] Critics on the left argued that Packard used his wealth and influence to advance policies that favored business interests at the expense of workers, consumers, and the environment. His close ties to Republican administrations and conservative think tanks suggested that his progressive management style at HP did not extend to support for progressive policies more broadly.

**Ideological Inconsistencies**: Some critics noted apparent contradictions between Packard's stated principles and his actions. While he advocated for employee dignity and corporate social responsibility within HP, his political activities often supported policies that labor unions and progressive activists opposed. His willingness to do business in apartheid South Africa contradicted his stated commitment to human dignity. These inconsistencies led some observers to question whether the "HP Way" was primarily a shrewd business strategy rather than a deeply held moral philosophy.

## Personal Life

David Packard married Lucile Salter in 1938, shortly before founding HP.[^61] He had met Lucile at Stanford University while washing dishes at the Delta Gamma sorority.[^62] Their marriage lasted until her death in 1987, spanning nearly five decades and forming one of the most consequential partnerships in American business and philanthropy. Lucile was not merely a supportive spouse but an active participant in HP's early years, serving as secretary, accountant, and personnel manager during the company's formative period.[^63]

The couple had four children: David Woodley Packard, Nancy Packard Burnett, Julie E. Packard, and Susan Packard Orr.[^64] The Packard children went on to distinguished careers of their own, with two daughters, Nancy and Julie, becoming marine biologists. Julie Packard became director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, continuing her father's commitment to ocean conservation and research.[^65] David Woodley Packard, Jr., pursued a career in theater before eventually serving as president of the Packard Humanities Institute, applying the family's resources to preserving and promoting cultural heritage.[^66] All three Packard daughters sit on the board of trustees of the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, ensuring family continuity in the foundation's mission.[^67]

Packard's physical presence was memorable—standing six-foot-five, he commanded attention in any room.[^68] Despite his imposing stature and immense wealth, colleagues and employees consistently described him as approachable and unpretentious. His practice of "management by wandering around" reflected a genuine interest in people at all levels of the organization, not merely a calculated management technique.[^69] Friends and associates noted that Packard retained the practical, hands-on approach of an engineer throughout his life, preferring to understand how things actually worked rather than simply reviewing reports and abstracts.

Away from business, Packard maintained strong connections to Stanford University, serving as president of the Board of Trustees.[^70] His relationship with Stanford was both personal and philanthropic—it was where he met his wife and business partner, where he developed his engineering expertise, and where he eventually directed substantial charitable giving. Packard and Hewlett, together and separately, donated more than $300 million to Stanford over their lifetimes.[^71] Their 1994 combined donation of $77 million led the university to name the David Packard Electrical Engineering Building in his honor.[^72]

Packard's personal interests extended to education policy, having chaired the Palo Alto School Board from 1948 to 1956.[^73] This involvement in local education governance reflected his belief in contributing to his community and his conviction that quality education was essential for both individual development and economic prosperity. His early service on the school board also gave him insights into public sector management that would inform his later government service.

In his later years, Packard focused increasingly on philanthropy and ocean conservation. The founding of MBARI in 1987 represented his growing concern for environmental issues and his belief that innovative science and engineering were necessary to better understand the ocean and address global environmental challenges.[^74] Unlike many business executives who view philanthropy as simply writing checks, Packard approached charitable giving with the same hands-on intensity he brought to business, establishing institutions designed for long-term impact rather than short-term visibility.

## Legacy

David Packard's death on March 26, 1996, at age 83 marked the end of an era, but his influence on American business, technology, and philanthropy continues to resonate decades later.[^75]

**Silicon Valley Pioneer and Model**: Packard stands as a founding father of Silicon Valley, the cradle of one of the most profound technology revolutions in history.[^76] The garage at 367 Addison Avenue in Palo Alto, where HP began, has become a pilgrimage site for entrepreneurs worldwide and serves as a powerful symbol of how great enterprises can emerge from humble beginnings with talent, determination, and innovative thinking.[^77] The designation of that garage as the "birthplace of Silicon Valley" acknowledges Packard and Hewlett's role not just in founding a successful company but in establishing a model that countless others would follow.

**The Enduring HP Way**: Perhaps Packard's most significant legacy is the "HP Way" as a management philosophy. Packard once said his most important contribution was his management style, and subsequent business history has validated that assessment.[^78] The HP Way's emphasis on respect for individuals, innovation, teamwork, and management by objectives rather than control became foundational principles for Silicon Valley corporate culture.[^79] Even as HP itself has struggled in recent decades with corporate restructuring and strategic challenges, the principles Packard articulated continue to influence how technology companies think about employee relations, innovation, and corporate responsibility.

Companies throughout Silicon Valley consciously imitated Packard's management style, creating a distinctive regional culture that emphasized flat hierarchies, stock options for employees, campus-like work environments, and the expectation that companies should contribute to broader social goods.[^80] While not all companies lived up to these ideals, the aspirational culture Packard helped create differentiated Silicon Valley from other business centers and contributed to its extraordinary success in attracting talent and generating innovation.

**Scale of Business Achievement**: The numerical scope of Packard's business achievement remains staggering. The company started with $538 in capital grew to $31 billion in revenues by his death, a return on investment of approximately 58 million percent.[^81] This growth was not merely about financial returns but about creating thousands of jobs, developing technologies that improved lives, and demonstrating that business success could be achieved while treating employees with dignity and respect.

**Philanthropic Impact**: Packard's philanthropic legacy may ultimately prove as significant as his business achievements. His entire $6.6 billion fortune went to the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, making it one of the nation's largest philanthropic organizations.[^82] The foundation's broad grantmaking programs span climate and conservation, reproductive healthcare, infant and child health, education, and democratic institutions.[^83] With over $8 billion in current assets, the foundation will continue advancing Packard's values long after his death.

Specific institutions created through Packard's philanthropy have become leaders in their fields. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), founded in 1987, has discovered more than 250 marine species (with over half formally described and named) and pioneered innovative marine technology.[^84] MBARI operates on Packard's principle that scientists, engineers, and marine operations should work in equal partnership to develop innovative solutions—essentially applying the HP Way to ocean research.[^85] In 2021, MBARI commissioned a new research vessel, the R/V David Packard, ensuring his name will be associated with ocean exploration for generations.[^86]

Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford, which opened in 1991 with $70 million in Packard family funding, has become one of the nation's premier pediatric medical centers, ranked by U.S. News & World Report in all 10 clinical specialty areas.[^87] The hospital represents not just charitable giving but a lasting institutional commitment to children's health and medical innovation.

**Educational Legacy**: Packard's impact on Stanford University extends beyond buildings bearing his name. Stanford's administrators stated that "Dave Packard, along with his wife, Lucile, and his partner, Bill Hewlett, have shaped and nurtured this university in ways that can only be compared to the founders, Jane and Leland Stanford."[^88] The more than $300 million in combined gifts from Packard and Hewlett helped Stanford maintain its position among the world's elite universities, particularly in engineering and sciences.[^89] Perhaps more importantly, the success of HP validated Stanford's model of encouraging entrepreneurship and maintaining close university-industry ties, helping to establish the pattern that made Silicon Valley possible.

**Defense and Government Reform**: Packard's government service, though controversial, produced lasting reforms in defense procurement and management. The Packard Commission's recommendations led to significant changes in how the Pentagon acquired weapons systems, introduced multi-year budgeting, and emphasized system-level thinking rather than individual program management.[^90] While debates continue about defense spending and procurement efficiency, Packard's basic insight—that business management principles could improve government operations—has been widely accepted across the political spectrum.

**Cultural Symbol**: Beyond specific achievements, Packard became a cultural symbol of the American entrepreneurial dream and the notion that business success and social responsibility could coexist. His life story—from small-town Colorado to Silicon Valley pioneer, from garage startup to global corporation, from engineer to statesman to philanthropist—embodied American ideals of opportunity, innovation, and service. That this narrative coexisted with real controversies and ethical complexities makes Packard's legacy more instructive than a simple hagiography would be, offering lessons about both the possibilities and limitations of American capitalism.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and business historians generally regard David Packard as one of the most important and innovative business leaders of the 20th century, particularly for his contributions to management philosophy and Silicon Valley's development.

Management experts consistently cite Packard as a pioneer who fundamentally transformed how companies think about employee relations and organizational structure. Business strategist and author James C. Collins studied HP extensively and concluded that the HP Way represented "one of the great organizational innovations of the twentieth century," demonstrating that companies could achieve both business success and create humane, respectful workplaces.[^91] The longevity and success of HP under principles Packard established—the company thrived for decades using management by objectives, profit sharing, and respect for individuals—provided empirical evidence that progressive management practices could generate superior business results.

Technology historians credit Packard (along with Hewlett) with establishing the template for Silicon Valley success. The Stanford-to-startup pipeline, the garage-to-global-corporation narrative, the emphasis on innovation and quality, and the creation of wealth that was then reinvested in education and research—all became standard patterns in Silicon Valley, and all trace directly to the HP model.[^92] David Brock, director of the Computer History Museum's Software History Center, argues that "without Hewlett-Packard's example, Silicon Valley as we know it might not exist."[^93]

Defenders of Packard's Pentagon service argue that he brought needed efficiency and systems thinking to defense procurement at a time when waste and mismanagement were rampant. Supporters note that he took a massive pay cut to serve, addressed conflict-of-interest concerns proactively, and implemented reforms that saved taxpayer money while improving military readiness.[^94] The Defense Systems Management College he established continues to train acquisition professionals decades later.[^95]

Philanthropic experts praise the Packard Foundation's approach to charitable giving, which combines substantial resources with strategic thinking and long-term institutional commitments. The foundation's willingness to support controversial causes like reproductive rights, alongside less contentious areas like ocean conservation and children's health, demonstrates a commitment to impact rather than merely reputation management.[^96] Ocean scientists particularly credit Packard's founding of MBARI as transformative for marine research, providing resources and technological capabilities that enabled discoveries impossible through traditional academic funding models.[^97]

Packard's admirers emphasize his integrity and consistency in applying his stated principles. Unlike many executives who espouse values while behaving differently, Packard's daily practice of management by wandering around, his willingness to take pay cuts during recessions rather than lay off workers, and his genuine interest in employees at all levels demonstrated authentic commitment to his philosophy.[^98] His pledge to donate any stock gains during his Pentagon service, which he fulfilled, showed a willingness to sacrifice personal financial gain for public service.[^99]

### Negative Views

Critics of David Packard focus on contradictions between his stated progressive values and certain actions, his political conservatism, and ethical compromises made in pursuit of business objectives.

Labor historians and progressive economists argue that the HP Way, while better than many alternatives, ultimately served management interests more than workers. Union organizers noted that HP's generous treatment of employees was part of a deliberate strategy to prevent unionization, and that Packard's management philosophy gave workers autonomy only within bounds defined by management.[^100] When employees' interests conflicted with business objectives—as in HP's later layoffs and restructurings—management philosophy proved less protective than union contracts would have been. Critics contend that praising Packard's "enlightened" management obscures the fundamental power imbalance in employer-employee relations.

Packard's involvement in apartheid South Africa remains his most serious ethical failure in the eyes of many historians. His statement that he would "rather lose business in Nebraska than with South Africa" when pressed about HP's operations under apartheid reveals that profit considerations ultimately trumped human rights concerns.[^101] Anti-apartheid activists argued that Packard's presence at the Johannesburg headquarters groundbreaking ceremony in 1980 provided propaganda value to a regime engaged in systematic racial oppression, and that companies like HP made apartheid economically sustainable longer than it otherwise would have been.[^102] The fact that Packard, who spoke eloquently about human dignity in his writings about management, was willing to do business with a system built on denying human dignity to Black South Africans exposes what critics see as profound moral inconsistency.

Political progressives criticize Packard's conservative political activities and funding. Despite creating a relatively progressive workplace culture at HP, Packard supported Republican politicians and policies that labor unions and civil rights organizations opposed.[^103] His trusteeship of conservative organizations like the American Enterprise Institute and his role as finance chairman for President Ford's campaign suggest that his progressive reputation was primarily about management efficiency rather than broader social commitments.[^104] Critics note that Packard opposed many government regulations designed to protect workers, consumers, and the environment, revealing that his corporate progressivism had sharp limits.

Regarding his Pentagon service, critics argue that Packard's charitable trust arrangement, while creative, did not truly eliminate conflicts of interest.[^105] Even if his HP stock value did not increase, decisions benefiting the electronics industry generally, maintaining high defense budgets, or awarding contracts to HP's suppliers and partners could still indirectly benefit him. Furthermore, the fundamental question of whether a defense contractor executive should oversee defense procurement was never adequately addressed. The Vietnam War context makes this more troubling—Packard profited from and then helped manage a war that many historians now view as a tragic mistake.[^106]

Environmental critics point out that while Packard's later ocean conservation work was admirable, HP under his leadership was a major industrial polluter, particularly regarding electronic waste and toxic chemicals used in manufacturing.[^107] The pivot to environmental philanthropy in his later years, while welcome, does not fully address the environmental damage caused by decades of electronics manufacturing. Some critics view this as "greenwashing"—using late-career philanthropy to rehabilitate the environmental reputation of a career spent in polluting industries.

Feminist scholars note that both HP's leadership and the broader Silicon Valley culture Packard helped create were overwhelmingly male-dominated. While Packard deserves credit for treating male employees well, women and minorities faced significant barriers to advancement in the technology industry that Packard did little to address.[^108] The "HP Way" articulated principles of dignity and respect but did not translate into serious efforts at diversity and inclusion, reflecting the limited social vision of its creator.
