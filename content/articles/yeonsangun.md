## Summary

Yeonsangun (born November 23, 1476; died November 20, 1506) was the 10th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1494 to 1506.[^1] He is universally remembered as the **worst tyrant** in the dynasty's history. His reign was characterized by two bloody knowledge purges (**Muo Sahwa** and **Kapcha Sahwa**), the suppression of free speech, the seizure of Sungkyunkwan university for personal pleasure, and extreme debauchery involving his favorite consort **Jang Nok-su**. He was deposed in the **Jungjong Coup** and stripped of his royal titles, ending his life in exile as a prince (Gun).[^2]

## The Trauma of the Deposed Queen

Yeonsangun was the son of **King Seongjong** and **Deposed Queen Yun**. His mother was executed by poisoning (Sayak) when he was a child due to her jealousy and temper.
*   **The Vindictive King:** Yeonsangun grew up unaware of the details, but upon discovering the truth, his rule turned dark. He sought violent revenge against anyone involved in his mother's death, leading to mass purges.[^3]

## Reign of Terror (The Literati Purges)

### Muo Sahwa (1498)
The first purge began when a scholar named **Kim Il-son** included a text in the royal archives that subtly criticized King Sejo (Yeonsangun's great-grandfather). Yeonsangun used this as an excuse to purge the **Sarim faction** of scholars who often criticized his behavior.

### Kapcha Sahwa (1504)
The more brutal second purge occurred when he fully uncovered the story of his mother's execution.
*   **Bloodshed:** He executed formerly powerful officials who had supported his mother's death. He even posthumously punished the dead (bugwan-chamsi), digging up their graves and beheading the corpses. He beat two of his father's concubines to death and forced their sons to watch.[^4]

## Tyranny and Excess

*   **Suppression of Speech:** He abolished the Office of Censors (Saaganwon) and destroyed the Office of Inspectors, silencing all criticism. He even banned the use of Hangul (Korean alphabet) because commoners were writing posters mocking him.[^5]
*   **Jang Nok-su:** His favorite concubine, a former slave and entertainer, wielded immense power. Together, they turned the highest educational institute, **Sungkyunkwan**, into a pleasure ground filled with thousands of kisaengs (entertainers) gathered from across the country.[^6]

## Downfall (Jungjong Restoration)

In 1506, a group of officials led by **Park Won-jong** staged a coup.
*   **Deposition:** The King was easily overthrown as he had no allies left. He was demoted to Prince Yeonsan and exiled to Ganghwa Island, where he died of illness two months later.
*   **No Temple Name:** Unlike other kings who have "Jo" or "Jong" (Great Ancestor) in their names, he is simply known as "Prince Yeonsan."[^7]
