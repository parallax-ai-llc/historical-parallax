## Overview

The Iranian Revolution (1978-1979) overthrew the Western-backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and established the world's first modern theocracy—the Islamic Republic of Iran—under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The revolution was driven by diverse grievances: opposition to authoritarianism, economic inequality, Western cultural influence, and the Shah's brutal secret police (SAVAK). Though initially a broad coalition revolution, Khomeini's Islamist faction soon dominated, creating a revolutionary Shia Islamic state that transformed Middle Eastern politics and U.S.-Iran relations for decades to come.
