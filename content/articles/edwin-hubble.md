## Summary

Edwin Hubble was an American astronomer who played a crucial role in establishing the field of extragalactic astronomy. He proved that many objects classified as 'nebulae' were actually galaxies beyond the Milky Way, fundamentally changing our understanding of the universe. Hubble's law, which describes the expanding universe, provided key observational evidence for the Big Bang theory. The Hubble Space Telescope is named in his honor.
