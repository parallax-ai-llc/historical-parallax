## Summary

Joan Mitchell was a leading second-generation Abstract Expressionist known for her vibrant, large-scale paintings inspired by landscape, memory, and poetry. Working mainly from her studio in Vetheuil, France, she created luminous canvases that bridge American abstraction with French landscape tradition. Her multi-panel paintings are among the most ambitious of the postwar era.
