## Summary

Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska, was one of the most influential African American leaders of the 20th century.[^1] A powerful orator and charismatic advocate for Black empowerment, he rose to prominence as a minister and national spokesman for the Nation of Islam before breaking away to form his own organizations and embrace orthodox Sunni Islam.[^2] His advocacy for Black self-determination, unflinching critique of white supremacy, and famous declaration that African Americans should defend themselves "by any means necessary" made him a polarizing yet transformative figure in the civil rights movement.[^3] Assassinated on February 21, 1965, at age 39, Malcolm X's legacy continued to inspire the Black Power movement and remains influential in contemporary struggles for racial justice.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Malcolm Little was born on May 19, 1925, in Omaha, Nebraska, the fourth of eight children to Louise Helen Little (née Langdon Norton), a homemaker from Grenada, and Earl Little, a Baptist lay preacher and outspoken supporter of Pan-African activist Marcus Garvey.[^5] From the moment of his birth, Malcolm's life was shaped by racial violence and white supremacist terrorism. When Malcolm was still an infant, the Ku Klux Klan surrounded the family home in Omaha, smashing windows with rifle butts and threatening Louise while Earl was away preaching. The attackers warned that "good Christian white people" did not want Earl Little spreading Marcus Garvey's message of Black nationalism.[^6]

Fleeing the constant threats, the Little family moved first to Milwaukee in 1926, then to Lansing, Michigan, in 1928.[^7] Even in Michigan, the family found no respite from racial terrorism. In 1929, their Lansing home was burned to the ground by white supremacists, likely members of the Black Legion, a Ku Klux Klan splinter group.[^8] The family watched helplessly as the house burned while white firefighters and police stood by. Two years later, in September 1931, Earl Little was found lying across streetcar tracks with his body nearly severed in half. While authorities ruled his death an accident, the Little family believed—and Malcolm would later assert—that Earl had been murdered by white supremacists who then placed his body on the tracks to disguise the killing.[^9]

The death of Earl Little plunged the family into economic devastation, as the life insurance company refused to pay the policy, claiming suicide.[^10] Louise struggled to support eight children during the Great Depression, working odd jobs while dealing with mounting psychological trauma. The welfare system subjected the family to invasive scrutiny and racist condescension. By 1938-1939, Louise suffered a mental breakdown and was committed to the Kalamazoo State Hospital, where she would remain institutionalized for 26 years.[^11] The children were separated and sent to different foster homes throughout the Lansing area.

Despite the trauma and instability, young Malcolm excelled academically at Mason Junior High School, where he was one of the few Black students. He was elected class president and harbored dreams of becoming a lawyer.[^12] However, a crushing encounter with his English teacher, Mr. Ostrowski, shattered these aspirations. When Malcolm expressed his ambition to become an attorney, Ostrowski responded that this was "no realistic goal for a nigger" and suggested carpentry instead.[^13] This moment of overt racism, coming from an educator Malcolm had respected, profoundly disillusioned him with the promise of integration and conventional paths to success. Shortly after, Malcolm dropped out of school after completing the eighth grade and moved to Boston to live with his half-sister, Ella Little-Collins.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Malcolm's teenage years in Boston and later New York City saw his descent into street life and criminality. In Boston's Roxbury neighborhood and Harlem, he adopted the street name "Detroit Red" due to his reddish hair and Michigan origins.[^15] He worked various legitimate jobs—shoeshine boy, soda jerk, busboy on the New Haven Railroad—but increasingly gravitated toward hustling. By his late teens, Malcolm was deeply involved in drug dealing, gambling, pimping, numbers running, and eventually armed robbery.[^16] He became a skilled hustler, navigating the dangerous underworld of wartime and post-war urban America.

In January 1946, Malcolm's criminal career came to an abrupt end when he attempted to retrieve a stolen watch from a Boston pawnshop and was arrested.[^17] At age 20, he was convicted on charges of burglary and firearms possession and sentenced to eight to ten years in prison—an unusually harsh sentence that Malcolm and others attributed to the fact that his burglary ring had included white women, including his girlfriend.[^18] On February 27, 1946, he entered Charlestown State Prison.

Malcolm's early prison years were marked by intense anger and rebellion. Fellow inmates nicknamed him "Satan" for his vitriolic denunciations of religion and God.[^19] The transformation that would change his life began when his siblings, particularly his brother Reginald, began writing to him about a new religious movement called the Nation of Islam, led by Elijah Muhammad.[^20] The Nation's teachings—that white people were "devils" created by an evil scientist named Yakub, that Black people were the original human beings, and that a separate Black nation must be established—resonated with Malcolm's experiences of racial violence and oppression.

In 1948, while transferred to the more progressive Norfolk Prison Colony with its extensive library, Malcolm underwent a profound intellectual awakening.[^21] He devoured books on philosophy, history, and religion, often reading late into the night by the dim glow of corridor lights. He studied the teachings of Elijah Muhammad intensively and began a disciplined program of self-education, copying an entire dictionary to expand his vocabulary.[^22] He also began the practice that would define his later life: he became a powerful writer and correspondent, exchanging letters with Elijah Muhammad and beginning to articulate the philosophy that would make him famous.

Malcolm was paroled in August 1952, emerging from prison a transformed man.[^23] He immediately traveled to Detroit to meet Elijah Muhammad in person and formally joined the Nation of Islam (NOI). He replaced his surname "Little," which he considered a slave name, with "X" to symbolize his lost African ancestral name.[^24] Within months, Malcolm X was appointed assistant minister of Detroit Temple Number One. His intelligence, charisma, organizational skills, and especially his extraordinary oratorical gifts quickly distinguished him within the movement.

By 1954, Elijah Muhammad appointed Malcolm X as minister of Temple Number Seven in Harlem, the Nation of Islam's most prominent location.[^25] Malcolm revolutionized the temple's operations, dramatically increasing membership through aggressive recruitment, disciplined organization, and electrifying public speaking. He established new temples across the East Coast and became the Nation's national representative and most visible spokesman.[^26] While Elijah Muhammad largely remained out of the public eye, Malcolm X became the face of the Nation of Islam, appearing on radio and television, engaging in debates at universities, and giving speeches that attracted thousands. Between 1952 and 1963, Nation of Islam membership grew from approximately 500 to 30,000, largely due to Malcolm X's tireless organizing and recruitment.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Malcolm X's most significant achievement was transforming the national conversation about race, civil rights, and Black identity in America. While Martin Luther King Jr. and mainstream civil rights organizations pursued integration through nonviolent protest, Malcolm X articulated a radical alternative that resonated with many African Americans, particularly in Northern urban areas where legal segregation was less of an issue than economic exploitation, police brutality, and systematic discrimination.[^28]

As the Nation of Islam's national spokesman throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, Malcolm X developed and popularized several key concepts that would have lasting impact. He was among the most forceful advocates of Black nationalism—the idea that African Americans constituted a nation within a nation and should seek self-determination rather than integration into white society.[^29] He argued that Black people should control the economics, politics, and social institutions of their own communities rather than depending on white beneficence or waiting for white society to grant rights.

Malcolm X's emphasis on armed self-defense represented a direct challenge to the nonviolence philosophy of the mainstream civil rights movement. His famous formulation "by any means necessary" encapsulated his view that African Americans had the right to defend themselves against racist violence.[^30] While often mischaracterized as advocating aggressive violence, Malcolm X's position was more nuanced: he argued that when the government failed to protect Black citizens from Ku Klux Klan terrorism, lynch mobs, and police brutality, those citizens had the natural and constitutional right to defend themselves with arms if necessary.[^31] This message particularly resonated with African Americans in Northern cities who faced police violence and did not see nonviolent protest as adequately addressing their concerns.

Malcolm X pioneered a powerful rhetoric of Black pride and self-respect that directly challenged the internalized racism promoted by white supremacist society. He spoke unapologetically about the beauty of Blackness, the dignity of African heritage, and the need for Black people to reject the standards of white society that taught them to hate themselves.[^32] His speeches emphasized African and Islamic history and civilization, countering narratives that presented Black people as having no history before slavery. This cultural nationalism anticipated and influenced the "Black is Beautiful" movement and the broader Black Arts and Black Power movements of the late 1960s and 1970s.[^33]

As a public intellectual and debater, Malcolm X was extraordinarily effective at articulating the frustrations of working-class and poor African Americans and forcing white Americans to confront uncomfortable truths about racism. He appeared frequently on television programs, participated in debates at Harvard, Oxford, and other elite universities, and gave hundreds of speeches.[^34] His sharp wit, extensive vocabulary, and ability to dismantle opponents' arguments made him a formidable presence in any forum. He was particularly skilled at exposing the hypocrisies of American democracy, contrasting professed American values of freedom and equality with the brutal realities of segregation, discrimination, and violence against Black people.

Malcolm X also made significant contributions to expanding the framework of Black liberation beyond civil rights to human rights. After his break with the Nation of Islam in 1964, he founded two organizations: Muslim Mosque, Inc., a religious organization rooted in orthodox Sunni Islam, and the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU), a secular Pan-African organization modeled on the Organization of African Unity.[^35] The OAAU sought to internationalize the Black freedom struggle by framing it as a human rights issue that could be brought before the United Nations, thereby circumventing the limitations of seeking redress solely within the American political system.[^36]

In April and May 1964, Malcolm X undertook a transformative pilgrimage to Mecca and subsequent travels throughout the Middle East and Africa.[^37] This journey profoundly altered his worldview. During the Hajj, he witnessed Muslims of all races—"blonde-haired, blue-eyed" Europeans alongside the darkest-skinned Africans—worshipping together without racial prejudice.[^38] In letters home, he wrote that this experience had caused him to "rearrange" his thinking about race and recognize that the problem was not white skin but rather the racist ideology of white supremacy.[^39] He met with heads of state across Africa, including Kwame Nkrumah in Ghana, Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, and Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, receiving support for his efforts to internationalize the African American struggle.[^40]

Malcolm X's Autobiography, written in collaboration with Alex Haley and published posthumously in 1965, became one of the most influential books of the 20th century.[^41] Selling millions of copies and translated into dozens of languages, the Autobiography introduced Malcolm X's life story and ideas to generations of readers worldwide, cementing his status as an iconic figure of Black resistance and self-determination.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Throughout his public life, Malcolm X was one of the most controversial figures in America, subjected to intense criticism from multiple quarters. Mainstream white media often portrayed him as a violent extremist and demagogue. Time magazine called him "an unashamed demagogue" whose "creed was violence," while The New York Times characterized him as "an extraordinary and twisted man" who "turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose."[^43] These portrayals consistently distorted Malcolm X's actual positions, particularly regarding violence.

The most notorious incident that damaged Malcolm X's reputation occurred on December 1, 1963, just nine days after President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Speaking at the Manhattan Center in New York, Malcolm X was asked about the assassination and responded that it was a case of "the chickens coming home to roost," meaning that the violence America perpetrated abroad and the climate of hate that allowed the murder of civil rights activists like Medgar Evers had created conditions where even a president could be killed.[^44] Newspapers quoted the remark out of context, making it appear that Malcolm X was celebrating or justifying Kennedy's murder, which he denied. The statement triggered a firestorm of criticism and gave Elijah Muhammad justification to silence Malcolm X, ordering him not to speak publicly for 90 days—a suspension that marked the beginning of Malcolm X's break with the Nation of Islam.[^45]

Malcolm X's relationship with the mainstream civil rights movement was contentious. He sharply criticized Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders for pursuing integration and relying on white liberal allies.[^46] He called the 1963 March on Washington the "Farce on Washington" and derided civil rights leaders as tools of the white power structure.[^47] King, in turn, criticized Malcolm X for "articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative."[^48] Many civil rights activists felt that Malcolm X's rhetoric was divisive and undermined the movement's progress by frightening white moderates and confirming stereotypes about Black militancy.

Malcolm X's advocacy within the Nation of Islam for complete racial separation was deeply controversial. He argued that integration was impossible and undesirable, that Black people should establish their own separate nation, and that interracial marriage was abhorrent.[^49] These positions aligned the Nation of Islam's goals with those of white segregationists, though from opposite motivations. The Nation's teaching that all white people were "devils" by nature was condemned as reverse racism by critics across the political spectrum.[^50]

The Nation of Islam's unorthodox theology also drew criticism from mainstream Muslims who viewed the organization's teachings—including the story of Yakub creating white people through genetic engineering, the claim that W.D. Fard was God incarnate, and Elijah Muhammad's status as a divine messenger—as blasphemous deviations from Islam.[^51] After Malcolm X converted to orthodox Sunni Islam in 1964, he himself acknowledged that the Nation's teachings were not authentic Islamic doctrine.

Malcolm X's treatment of women has been subject to criticism. During his time with the Nation of Islam, he espoused strict patriarchal views, arguing that women should be submissive to men and confined primarily to domestic roles.[^52] While his views evolved somewhat after his break with the Nation, and while he worked with female activists in the Organization of Afro-American Unity, his gender politics remained conservative by contemporary standards.

The circumstances surrounding Malcolm X's break with the Nation of Islam in 1964 involved serious allegations on both sides. Malcolm X cited his discovery that Elijah Muhammad had fathered several children with young secretaries in the Nation, violating the organization's strict moral code.[^53] Nation of Islam leadership, meanwhile, accused Malcolm X of jealousy, insubordination, and seeking to take credit for Elijah Muhammad's work. The bitter split led to death threats against Malcolm X from Nation members, increasing tensions that would ultimately lead to his assassination.[^54]

Some critics, particularly after his death, argued that Malcolm X's militancy and confrontational rhetoric contributed to increased racial tensions, riots, and the violent turn that some elements of the Black liberation movement took in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Conversely, some radicals criticized Malcolm X for moderating his positions after his Hajj, viewing his new openness to working with progressive whites and his embrace of orthodox Islam as a betrayal of Black nationalism.[^55]

## Personal Life

On January 14, 1958, Malcolm X married Betty Sanders, who took the name Betty X and later Betty Shabazz.[^56] Betty had been a member of Temple Number Seven in Harlem and a nursing student. Their marriage initially followed the Nation of Islam's strict patriarchal model, with Malcolm X setting the rules and Betty expected to be submissive.[^57] However, over time, particularly after Malcolm's break with the Nation of Islam, their relationship evolved into a more equal partnership, with Betty becoming an important advisor and collaborator in Malcolm's work.

The couple had six daughters together: Attallah (born 1958), Qubilah (born 1960), Ilyasah (born 1962), Gamilah Lumumba (born 1964), and twins Malikah and Malaak (born in 1965, seven months after Malcolm's death).[^58] Malcolm was a devoted father who took seriously his responsibilities to his family despite his demanding schedule. He was known to help with household chores and spend quality time with his daughters when he could, though his constant travel and activism meant he was frequently away from home.

Life in the Malcolm X household was shaped by the constant threat of violence. The family received frequent death threats, particularly after Malcolm's break with the Nation of Islam in 1964.[^59] On February 14, 1965, just one week before Malcolm's assassination, the family's home in East Elmhurst, Queens, was firebombed in the middle of the night.[^60] Malcolm, Betty, and their four daughters (Betty was pregnant with the twins) barely escaped with their lives. The Nation of Islam denied responsibility, while Malcolm X accused them of attempting to kill his family. Some accounts suggest Malcolm himself may have started the fire to garner sympathy, though this claim is disputed and not well-evidenced.[^61]

Malcolm X was known for his discipline, intelligence, and intense work ethic. He typically slept only four to five hours per night, spending the rest of his time reading, writing, organizing, or speaking.[^62] He maintained the strict dietary and health practices of the Nation of Islam even after leaving the organization, avoiding pork, tobacco, alcohol, and drugs—a remarkable commitment given his earlier life as a hustler who had been involved in all these vices.

Those who knew Malcolm X personally often noted the contrast between his public image as an angry, confrontational militant and his private demeanor. Close associates described him as warm, thoughtful, and possessed of a keen sense of humor.[^63] He was known for his courtesy, his impeccable dress (always wearing conservative suits), and his respectful treatment of others in personal interactions. He had the ability to engage with anyone from street hustlers to heads of state with equal ease and authenticity.

Malcolm X's relationship with his half-sister Ella Little-Collins was particularly significant. Ella, who lived in Boston, provided crucial support at multiple points in Malcolm's life: taking him in as a teenager, helping fund his pilgrimage to Mecca, and later taking over leadership of the Organization of Afro-American Unity after his death.[^64] Malcolm viewed Ella as the strongest person he knew and credited her with being a major influence in his life.

In his final year, Malcolm X was a man under enormous pressure. He faced death threats from the Nation of Islam, surveillance from the FBI (which had maintained a file on him since the 1950s), and the challenge of building new organizations with limited resources while supporting a growing family.[^65] Associates from this period describe a man who was exhausted but determined, increasingly aware that he might be killed but committed to continuing his work. In the weeks before his assassination, Malcolm X spoke openly about the threats against him and seemed resigned to the possibility that he would not live long.[^66]

## Legacy

Malcolm X's assassination on February 21, 1965, transformed him from a controversial figure into a martyr and icon. The publication of The Autobiography of Malcolm X later that year introduced his life story to millions of readers, particularly young African Americans who embraced him as a hero.[^67] By the late 1960s, as the civil rights movement gave way to the Black Power movement, Malcolm X became the ideological lodestar for a new generation of activists.

Malcolm X was "the inspiration behind much of the black power movement," and many of the ideas he articulated—race pride, self-defense, community control, and Black nationalism—became foundational principles of organizations like the Black Panther Party, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) after it embraced Black Power, and countless local community organizations.[^68] Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown, Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, and other Black Power leaders explicitly acknowledged Malcolm X's influence on their thinking.[^69]

The slogan "Black is Beautiful" and the broader cultural movement to embrace African American identity, natural hairstyles, African clothing and names, and Black cultural expression owed a significant debt to Malcolm X's emphasis on racial pride and his rejection of white aesthetic standards.[^70] The Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 1970s, led by figures like Amiri Baraka, drew heavily on Malcolm X's cultural nationalism and his example of uncompromising Black expression.[^71]

Malcolm X's influence extended far beyond the United States. His Pan-African vision and his efforts to connect the African American freedom struggle with decolonization movements in Africa, Asia, and Latin America inspired liberation movements worldwide.[^72] Aboriginal activists in Australia, anti-apartheid organizers in South Africa, and various independence movements cited Malcolm X as an influence. His critique of imperialism and neo-colonialism resonated in the Third World and among leftist movements globally.

In the decades since his death, Malcolm X has been embraced by diverse and sometimes contradictory groups, each claiming him for their particular vision. Sunni Muslims honor him as a true Muslim who brought many African Americans to orthodox Islam.[^73] Black nationalists claim him as the prophet of Black self-determination. Marxists and socialists point to his late-life evolution toward socialism and his critique of capitalism.[^74] Even mainstream politicians and corporations have appropriated his image, something that would have likely appalled Malcolm X given his radical politics.

The 1990s saw a major resurgence of interest in Malcolm X, triggered largely by Spike Lee's 1992 biographical film "Malcolm X," starring Denzel Washington.[^75] The film introduced Malcolm X to a new generation and sparked a commercial boom in Malcolm X merchandise—T-shirts, hats, posters—that ironically turned the anti-capitalist revolutionary into a consumer product. Hip-hop culture embraced Malcolm X, with artists from Public Enemy to Tupac Shakur to Kendrick Lamar referencing him in their work and sampling his speeches.[^76]

Hundreds of schools, streets, and public facilities across the United States have been renamed in Malcolm X's honor.[^77] The Audubon Ballroom site where he was assassinated was partially redeveloped in 2005 to house the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center.[^78] Malcolm X Day is celebrated as a holiday in some cities and states.

Malcolm X's legacy has taken on renewed significance in the 21st century. The Black Lives Matter movement, formed in response to police killings of African Americans, echoes Malcolm X's critiques of police brutality and his emphasis on Black self-defense.[^79] His analysis of systemic racism, structural inequality, and the limitations of seeking justice solely through the American legal and political system resonate with contemporary activists who see many of the same issues Malcolm X addressed—police violence, economic exploitation, mass incarceration—persisting or worsening.

The November 2021 exoneration of two of the three men convicted of assassinating Malcolm X—Muhammad Abdul Aziz and Khalil Islam—vindicated long-standing claims by researchers and activists that the men were wrongly convicted.[^80] The investigation revealed that both the FBI and NYPD had withheld evidence that would have cleared the two men, and that the FBI's surveillance of Malcolm X may have contributed to failures to prevent his assassination. Khalil Islam had died in 2009 still proclaiming his innocence; Aziz lived to see his name cleared at age 83. The exoneration renewed attention to Malcolm X's life and the government's role in suppressing Black radical movements.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessment of Malcolm X has grown increasingly positive over the decades since his death. Historian Manning Marable called Malcolm X "the most important African American leader of the 20th century," arguing that his influence on Black consciousness and the Black freedom struggle exceeded even that of Martin Luther King Jr.[^81] Historian Peniel E. Joseph writes that Malcolm X "transformed American democracy" by expanding the boundaries of acceptable political discourse and forcing the nation to confront uncomfortable truths about racism.[^82]

Many scholars emphasize that Malcolm X's militancy and the threat he represented actually made Martin Luther King Jr. and moderate civil rights leaders more palatable to white America, thereby accelerating civil rights legislation. Political scientist Michael Eric Dyson argues that Malcolm X and King represented complementary rather than contradictory approaches, with Malcolm's uncompromising stance making King's demands seem more reasonable by comparison.[^83]

Contemporary scholars praise Malcolm X for his intellectual rigor and his model of self-education. His transformation from eighth-grade dropout to sophisticated intellectual who could hold his own in debates at Oxford University demonstrates the power of disciplined self-study.[^84] His Autobiography has been required reading in countless classrooms, introducing students to themes of personal transformation, racial identity, and political awakening.

Malcolm X is celebrated for his authenticity and his willingness to evolve. Unlike many political leaders, Malcolm X publicly acknowledged when his views changed, as he did after his Hajj pilgrimage when he reconsidered his blanket condemnation of all white people.[^85] This intellectual honesty and capacity for growth is seen as a model of how commitment to truth should supersede rigid ideology.

Feminist scholars have noted that while Malcolm X held patriarchal views, women in the Nation of Islam and later in the Organization of Afro-American Unity found empowerment in the movement's emphasis on Black dignity and its requirement that men treat women with respect, even if within traditional gender roles.[^86] Some women activists have argued that the protection and respect Malcolm X advocated for Black women, within his cultural context, represented a significant challenge to white supremacist degradation of Black womanhood.

Muslim scholars and communities honor Malcolm X as one of the most important figures in the history of Islam in America, crediting him with bringing tens of thousands of African Americans to the religion and with articulating an authentically American Muslim identity.[^87] His embrace of orthodox Sunni Islam and his criticisms of the Nation of Islam's unorthodox teachings after his Hajj are seen as evidence of his genuine spiritual seeking.

### Negative Views

Despite his iconic status, Malcolm X continues to face significant criticism from various perspectives. Some historians and political scientists argue that his confrontational rhetoric was counterproductive, frightening potential white allies and providing ammunition to white supremacists who used his statements to portray the entire Black freedom struggle as extremist and violent.[^88] These critics suggest that Malcolm X's militancy ultimately hindered rather than helped the cause of racial justice by energizing white backlash.

Civil rights veterans who worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and other integrationist leaders sometimes view Malcolm X's legacy as divisive. They argue that his criticisms of nonviolence and integration were unfair, that he offered critique without practical alternatives, and that his separatist vision was both unrealistic and morally problematic.[^89] Some point out that while Malcolm X was giving fiery speeches, it was King and others who were organizing the boycotts, sit-ins, and voter registration drives that actually changed laws and expanded rights.

The historian Manning Marable's 2011 biography of Malcolm X, while generally admiring, sparked controversy by revealing unflattering details about Malcolm X's life, including suggestions about his possible same-sex encounters in his youth and his manipulation of various situations for personal or political gain.[^90] Marable's work was criticized by some Malcolm X devotees and scholars as an attempt to diminish Malcolm X's revolutionary legacy and remake him into a more moderate, palatable figure. The collection of essays "A Lie of Reinvention," edited by Jared Ball and Todd Steven Burroughs, argues that Marable's biography was "at best flawed and at worst a major setback in American history, African American studies, and scholarship on the life of Malcolm X."[^91]

Some critics note that Malcolm X's practical achievements were limited compared to his rhetorical impact. Unlike King, who led campaigns that resulted in landmark legislation, or even compared to the Black Panther Party, which created social programs like free breakfast for children, Malcolm X's organizations accomplished relatively little in concrete terms before his death.[^92] The Organization of Afro-American Unity never gained significant membership or achieved its goals of bringing the United States before the United Nations for human rights violations.

Conservative critics have long portrayed Malcolm X as a dangerous radical whose ideas led to urban riots, the militant turn of the civil rights movement, and the breakdown of law and order in American cities during the late 1960s.[^93] They argue that his rhetoric of Black rage and his dismissal of nonviolence contributed to violence that harmed Black communities and damaged race relations.

Some on the left argue that Malcolm X's break with revolutionary ideology came too late and was incomplete. They criticize his nationalism as potentially reactionary and note that while he moved toward socialism in his final year, he never fully articulated a coherent economic or political program beyond Pan-Africanism and anti-imperialism.[^94]

Finally, scholars have noted that the commercial appropriation of Malcolm X's image—on t-shirts, posters, and other merchandise, often sold by corporations that exploit workers and engage in the very capitalism Malcolm X opposed—represents a tragic irony. The revolutionary who rejected the American system has been absorbed into consumer culture, his image sanitized and commodified, which some see as the ultimate neutralization of his radical message.[^95]
