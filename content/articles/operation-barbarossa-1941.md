## Overview

Operation Barbarossa (June 22, 1941) was the code name for the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. It remains the **largest military operation in human history**. Adolf Hitler broke the 1939 Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, unleashing 3.8 million soldiers, 3,350 tanks, and 2,770 aircraft across a 2,900 km front. The goal was **Lebensraum** (living space) in the East and the destruction of "Jewish Bolshevism." While the Wehrmacht achieved staggering initial success—encircling millions of Soviet troops at Kiev, Minsk, and Smolensk—the offensive stalled at the gates of Moscow in December due to winter weather, overstretched supply lines, and fierce Soviet resistance.

## Order of Battle

### Axis Powers (Army Groups North, Center, South)
- **Strength:** 3.8 million men (including Romanian, Finnish, Hungarian allies). 600,000 horses (critical for logistics).
- **Strategy:** Blitzkrieg. Deep armored thrusts to encircle Soviet armies before they could retreat.
- **Objective:** The "A-A Line" (Archangel to Astrakhan).

### Soviet Union (Red Army)
- **Strength:** 5 million men (but many in Far East guarding against Japan).
- **State:** Purged officer corps (Stalin killed his best generals in 1937). In transition.
- **Surprise:** Stalin refused to believe intelligence warnings. Planes were bombed on the ground.

## Idealism vs Reality

**Hitler's Prediction:** "We have only to kick in the door and the whole rotten structure will come crashing down."
**The Reality:** The Red Army suffered 3 million casualties in 1941 alone... and *kept fighting*. The T-34 tank shocked the Germans.

## Causes of Failure

### 1. The Delay (Balkans)
Germany invaded Yugoslavia/Greece in April 1941 to bail out Italy. Some argue this delayed Barbarossa by 5 critical weeks.

### 2. General Winter
By October, rains turned Russian roads into mud (**Rasputitsa**), stopping supplies.
By November, temps hit -40°C. Germans had no winter oil (guns jammed), no winter coats.
**Frostbite:** 100,000 cases in weeks.

### 3. Scorched Earth
Stalin ordered retreating troops to burn everything. Dismantled 1,500 factories and moved them to the Urals (out of bomber range).

## The Holocaust

Barbarossa marked the start of the "Holocaust by Bullets." **Einsatzgruppen** (SS death squads) followed the army, shooting 1.3 million Jews in pits (e.g., Babi Yar ravine).
