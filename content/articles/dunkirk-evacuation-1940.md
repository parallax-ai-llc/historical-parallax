## Overview

The Dunkirk evacuation (May 26 – June 4, 1940), codenamed **Operation Dynamo**, was the miraculous rescue of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and allied French troops from the beaches of Dunkirk. Cut off by the German "Sickle Cut" maneuver that sliced through the Ardennes to the sea, 400,000 allied troops were trapped in a shrinking pocket with the sea at their backs. Expected to save only 45,000 men, a hastily assembled fleet of 800 vessels—destroyers, ferries, and hundreds of civilian "Little Ships"—evacuated 338,000 men under constant Luftwaffe attack. While a military defeat (Churchill: "Wars are not won by evacuations"), it saved the British Army from annihilation.

## The Collapse of France

**Manstein Plan:**
German Panzers bypassed the Maginot Line, attacking through the dense Ardennes forest (believed impassable for tanks).
They reached the English Channel on May 20, splitting the Allied armies in two.
With no port left but Dunkirk, the BEF retreated to the coast.

### The Halt Order (May 24)
General Gerd von Rundstedt halted the Panzer advance just 12 miles from Dunkirk. Hitler approved it.
**Why?**
1.  **Terrain:** Marshy ground around Dunkirk was bad for tanks.
2.  **Luftwaffe:** Hermann Göring boasted his air force could destroy the trapped army alone.
3.  **Reserves:** Saving tanks for the final push south (Paris).
**Result:** Gave Allies 48 hours to fortify the perimeter.

## The Evacuation (Operation Dynamo)

### The Fleet
- **Royal Navy:** 39 Destroyers (risky; shallow water makes them targets).
- **The Little Ships:** The Admiralty requisitioned ~700 private boats (yachts, fishing trawlers, lifeboats, paddle steamers) to ferry men from shallow beaches to big ships.

### The Mole
The Eastern Mole (a concrete breakwater) was the only structure usable for docking.
~200,000 men were lifted directly from the Mole onto destroyers.
The rest had to wade into the sea to the Little Ships.

### The Air War
The RAF fought fiercely inland to intercept German bombers. Soldiers on the beach, being bombed, cursed the RAF ("Where are they?"), not knowing they were protecting them from miles away.

## Aftermath

### The "Dunkirk Spirit"
Turned a disaster into a morale boost. Civil society helping the military.

### Churchill's Speech (June 4)
Delivered to Parliament:
> "We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender."

### Fate of French
Those evacuated returned to France to fight (then surrendered days later) or joined Free French.
The French soldiers taken prisoner at Dunkirk spent 5 years in camps.
