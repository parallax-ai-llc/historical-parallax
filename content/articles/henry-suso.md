## Summary

Henry Suso was a German Dominican friar and mystic who was a disciple of Meister Eckhart. He popularized Eckhart's mystical theology through his devotional writings, particularly The Little Book of Eternal Wisdom, which became one of the most widely read devotional works of the late Middle Ages. His autobiography, Vita, is one of the first spiritual autobiographies in the German language. He combined profound mystical experience with tender devotional expression.
