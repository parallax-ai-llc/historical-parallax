## Summary

Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima, born September 18, 1976, is a Brazilian former professional footballer widely regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time. Nicknamed "O Fenômeno" (The Phenomenon) and "R9", he won two FIFA World Cups (1994, 2002), three FIFA World Player of the Year awards (1996, 1997, 2002), and two Ballon d'Or trophies (1997, 2002).[^1][^2] Despite career-threatening knee injuries that sidelined him for nearly two years, Ronaldo made a triumphant comeback to lead Brazil to World Cup glory in 2002, scoring eight goals including two in the final.[^3] His extraordinary combination of speed, skill, and clinical finishing revolutionized the striker position and influenced generations of footballers.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima was born on September 18, 1976, in Itaguaí, a municipality in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, as the third child of Nélio Nazário de Lima Sr. and Sônia dos Santos Barata.[^5] An interesting discrepancy exists regarding his birth date: his birth certificate was only issued four days later, on September 22, when his parents had scraped together enough money to pay for it, which is why some sources list this later date.[^6]

Ronaldo grew up in the humble neighborhood of Bento Ribeiro, a suburb of Rio de Janeiro notorious for its high crime rates, particularly homicides due to drug trafficking.[^7] Despite these challenging circumstances and his family's poverty, Ronaldo initially excelled academically. However, his life took a pivotal turn when his parents separated when he was only 11 years old. Shortly after this separation, Ronaldo made the life-changing decision to drop out of school to pursue a career in football.[^8]

His journey into football began on the streets of Bento Ribeiro, where he honed his skills playing with local children.[^9] His first organized team was Valqueire Tenis Clube, a futsal club. At age 12, he joined the Social Ramos futsal team, where his extraordinary talent became immediately apparent. In his first season, Ronaldo led the city's youth league in scoring with a record-breaking 166 goals, including an astonishing performance where he scored 11 of his team's 12 goals in a single match.[^10]

His remarkable skills caught the attention of Jairzinho, a retired Brazilian football legend who had scored in every match of Brazil's 1970 World Cup triumph. Jairzinho, who was coaching São Cristóvão's youth team at the time, became instrumental in launching Ronaldo's professional career.[^11] This connection would prove crucial in transitioning the young prodigy from the streets of Bento Ribeiro to professional football clubs. The poverty and adversity of his childhood shaped Ronaldo's hunger for success and his relentless drive to escape the difficult circumstances into which he was born.

## Rise to Power

Ronaldo's meteoric rise to football stardom began when he made his professional debut for Cruzeiro on May 25, 1993, against Caldense in the Minas Gerais State Championship at just 16 years old.[^12] His impact was immediate and devastating. On October 5, 1993, he scored his first senior career hat-trick against Chilean side Colo-Colo in a 6-1 victory in the Supercopa Libertadores.[^13] Just a month later, on November 7, 1993, Ronaldo announced his arrival on the national stage by scoring five goals in Cruzeiro's 6-0 home win against Bahia, a performance that captured Brazil's attention.[^14]

His extraordinary performances at Cruzeiro, where he scored 44 goals in 47 matches, attracted international attention.[^15] On March 23, 1994, at just 17 years old, Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil in a friendly match against Argentina in Recife.[^16] Later that year, he became the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup, though he did not play in any matches during the tournament.[^17]

In 1994, Ronaldo made the leap to European football, joining Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. He scored ten minutes into his debut for PSV against Vitesse on August 28, 1994, signaling the beginning of a dominant European career.[^18] In his single season at PSV, Ronaldo scored 30 goals in 33 appearances, establishing himself as one of Europe's most lethal strikers.[^19]

His performances attracted Barcelona, who signed him in 1996 for a then-world record transfer fee of $19.5 million.[^20] At Barcelona, Ronaldo produced one of the most spectacular individual seasons in football history, scoring 47 goals in 49 appearances across all competitions.[^21] His combination of blistering pace, mesmerizing dribbling ability, and clinical finishing left defenders helpless and fans worldwide in awe. At just 20 years old, he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year, becoming the youngest recipient of the award.[^22]

In 1997, Ronaldo transferred to Inter Milan for a record fee of $27 million (19 million euros).[^23] At Inter, he continued his dominance, winning the FIFA World Player of the Year award for the second consecutive year and claiming his first Ballon d'Or in 1997, again becoming the youngest player to receive this prestigious honor at age 21.[^24] This period marked Ronaldo's ascension from a prodigious talent to the undisputed best footballer in the world, revolutionizing the striker position with his unique blend of power, speed, and technical brilliance.

## Major Achievements

Ronaldo Nazário's trophy cabinet and individual accolades cement his status among football's all-time greats. His achievements span club and international football, with performances that frequently defied belief and redefined what was possible for a striker.

### International Glory

Ronaldo's international career with Brazil produced two FIFA World Cup victories. In 1994, at age 17, he was part of Brazil's World Cup-winning squad, though he did not feature in matches.[^25] His defining international moment came at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in South Korea and Japan. After suffering devastating knee injuries that threatened to end his career, Ronaldo's comeback culminated in a magnificent tournament where he scored eight goals, winning the Golden Boot as top scorer.[^26] In the final against Germany in Yokohama, he scored both goals in Brazil's 2-0 victory, tying Pelé's Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals.[^27]

At the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, despite the controversial circumstances surrounding the final where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kickoff, Ronaldo still received the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player, having scored four goals and provided two assists to help Brazil reach the final.[^28] The 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany saw Ronaldo break Gerd Müller's all-time World Cup scoring record when he scored his 15th World Cup goal in a second-round match against Ghana.[^29] This record stood until 2014. Across four World Cup tournaments (1994, 1998, 2002, 2006), Ronaldo scored 15 goals in 19 appearances, including 10 goals in knockout matches—the highest total of any player in history.[^30]

Ronaldo also won two Copa América titles with Brazil. In 1997, he was named player of the tournament,[^31] and in 1999, he finished as the competition's top goalscorer.[^32]

### Individual Honors

Ronaldo won the FIFA World Player of the Year award three times (1996, 1997, and 2002),[^33] becoming the first player to win the award in consecutive years. He claimed the Ballon d'Or twice (1997 and 2002),[^34] with his first win at age 21 making him the youngest recipient by a landslide margin at that time.[^35] For his remarkable return from career-threatening injury to World Cup glory in 2002, he won the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year.[^36]

In 2004, Pelé included Ronaldo in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players.[^37] Ronaldo has been inducted into multiple halls of fame, including the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame, Italian Football Hall of Fame, Inter Milan Hall of Fame, and Real Madrid Hall of Fame.[^38] In 2020, he was selected for the Ballon d'Or Dream Team, an all-time greatest XI published by France Football magazine.[^39]

### Club Success

At club level, Ronaldo won league titles and cups across multiple countries. With PSV Eindhoven, he helped the club compete at the highest level of Dutch football. His season at Barcelona in 1996-97 saw him win the Copa del Rey and UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, though a league title eluded him.[^40] At Inter Milan, he won the UEFA Cup in 1998.[^41] With Real Madrid, where he played from 2002 to 2007, he won La Liga in 2003 and 2007, and the Spanish Supercopa in 2003.[^42] In the final chapter of his career at Corinthians (2009-2011), he won the Campeonato Paulista and Copa do Brasil in 2009, and the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A in 2011.[^43]

Ronaldo's goal-scoring record was phenomenal: he scored over 400 goals across his club and international career, with his ability to score from any position, against any opponent, making him one of the most feared strikers in football history.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his extraordinary achievements, Ronaldo's career was not without significant controversies and criticisms that periodically overshadowed his brilliance on the pitch.

### The 1998 World Cup Final Mystery

The most infamous controversy of Ronaldo's career occurred before the 1998 World Cup final against France. Hours before kickoff, Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit in his hotel room, leading to confusion about whether he would play.[^44] Initially left off the team sheet, he was mysteriously reinstated just before the match. Brazil lost 3-0, and Ronaldo's performance was noticeably subdued. Conspiracy theories emerged suggesting external pressure from sponsors led to his inclusion despite being unfit to play. The exact circumstances of what happened that night remain disputed, with various teammates and officials providing conflicting accounts over the years.[^45]

### Career-Defining Injuries

Ronaldo's career was severely derailed by catastrophic knee injuries that many believe prevented him from reaching even greater heights. In November 1999, while playing for Inter Milan against Lecce, he suffered a ruptured tendon that required surgery.[^46] After months of rehabilitation, Ronaldo returned to action on April 12, 2000, in the Coppa Italia final against Lazio. Tragically, he lasted only six minutes before suffering a complete rupture of the tendons in his kneecap.[^47]

His physiotherapist Nilton Petrone later described the horrifying injury: "His kneecap actually exploded and it ended up in the middle of his thigh."[^48] Ronaldo suffered from trochlear dysplasia, a condition that makes the relationship between the kneecap and the femur unstable, contributing to the severity of his injuries.[^49] These back-to-back injuries occurred when Ronaldo was at his absolute peak at age 23, having already scored over 200 goals for club and country. Many football experts and former players have lamented that injuries robbed the world of witnessing Ronaldo's full potential.[^50]

### Weight and Fitness Issues

Following his knee injuries, Ronaldo struggled with weight gain and fitness issues that plagued his later career. He was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, a medical condition that contributed to weight gain and made maintaining peak physical condition more challenging.[^51] During the 2006 World Cup, despite breaking the all-time scoring record, Ronaldo was frequently ridiculed in the media for his fitness levels and heavier physique compared to his earlier years.[^52] Critics questioned his dedication and professionalism, though supporters pointed to his medical condition and the physical toll of multiple serious injuries.

### The 2008 Scandal

In April 2008, Ronaldo became embroiled in a scandal in Rio de Janeiro when he was involved in an incident with three transgender sex workers.[^53] The incident made international headlines and caused significant personal embarrassment. His then-fiancée Maria Beatriz Antony left their home that night, though they later married before eventually divorcing in 2012.[^54]

### Criticism of Dedication

In his final years, some critics accused Ronaldo of lacking the dedication and discipline of other elite players. Injuries, weight issues, and what some perceived as scandalous behavior led to questions about his commitment to maintaining peak condition.[^55] During his final season at Corinthians, following the club's disastrous Copa Libertadores exit, he became the target of aggressive criticism from supporters, which likely contributed to his decision to retire at age 34.[^56]

### Recent Political Controversy

In recent years, Ronaldo has faced controversy over political statements. In 2023, comments he made on the Charla Podcast suggesting that Neymar held the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) president responsible for his ACL injury created a media firestorm.[^57] Three days later, Ronaldo issued a public apology to Neymar via social media. When Ronaldo considered running for the CBF presidency, his wife Celina Locks controversially labeled Brazil "a disgusting country" after he withdrew from consideration, sparking further backlash.[^58]

## Personal Life

Ronaldo Nazário's personal life has been as eventful and closely scrutinized as his professional career, marked by multiple marriages, children from different relationships, and the challenges of maintaining privacy under intense media spotlight.

### Marriages and Relationships

Ronaldo has been married three times, with each relationship receiving significant media attention. His first marriage was to Milene Domingues in 1999, herself a Brazilian footballer known for breaking the world record for ball control.[^59] The couple had a son named Ronald in 2000, but divorced three years later in 2002.[^60]

In 2005, Ronaldo became engaged to Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniella Cicarelli in what became one of the most publicized relationships in Brazilian entertainment.[^61] Their wedding at the Château de Chantilly in France was an extravagant affair, but the marriage lasted only three months. Cicarelli became pregnant during their brief relationship but suffered a miscarriage.[^62]

Ronaldo's third marriage was to Maria Beatriz "Bia" Antony, whom he met in 2007 while playing for AC Milan.[^63] They married that same year and had two daughters together: Maria Sophia and Maria Alice.[^64] However, the relationship was damaged by the 2008 scandal involving transgender sex workers in Rio de Janeiro, with Bia leaving their home the night the incident became public.[^65] Despite reconciling, the couple eventually divorced in 2012.

In 2015, Ronaldo met Celina Locks, a Brazilian model and entrepreneur, when he was 38 and she was 25.[^66] After dating for eight years, they got engaged in January 2023 while vacationing in the Caribbean. On September 26, 2023, they held an elegant wedding ceremony at a church in Ibiza, Spain.[^67] Celina has become a prominent figure in fashion circles, sitting front row at Paris Fashion Week shows including Victoria Beckham's presentation, and maintaining friendships with celebrities like Gisele Bündchen.[^68]

### Children

Ronaldo is the father of four children from different relationships. Ronald, born in 2000, is his son with first wife Milene Domingues.[^69] With Bia Antony, he has two daughters: Maria Sophia and Maria Alice.[^70] 

In December 2010, Ronaldo took a paternity test and was confirmed to be the father of a boy named Alexander, born in April 2005.[^71] Alexander was born after a brief relationship between Ronaldo and Michele Umezu, a Brazilian waitress whom Ronaldo first met in Tokyo in 2002.[^72] Ronaldo has maintained a relationship with all his children despite the complexities of his personal life.

### Personality and Character

Those who know Ronaldo describe him as charismatic, warm, and possessing an infectious smile that endeared him to teammates and fans worldwide. His close friendship with Roberto Carlos, his Brazilian national team teammate, was particularly notable. Ronaldo once quipped: "I have spent more nights with Roberto Carlos than all of the women I have been married to put together. My best teammate was Roberto Carlos."[^73]

Despite the privileges of wealth and fame, Ronaldo has remained connected to his humble origins. He has spoken openly about the poverty of his childhood and how it motivated his relentless pursuit of success. In interviews, he has demonstrated self-awareness about his journey, saying: "Every time I went away I was deceiving my mum. I'd tell her I was going to school but I'd be out on the street playing football. I always had a ball on my feet."[^74]

### Post-Retirement Life

Since retiring from professional football in 2011, Ronaldo has maintained a high public profile through his business ventures and football club ownership. He lives a luxurious lifestyle befitting his status as one of football's greatest players, dividing his time between Brazil and Europe, and frequently attending major sporting and social events alongside his wife Celina.

## Legacy

Ronaldo Nazário's legacy transcends statistics and trophies, representing a paradigm shift in how the striker position could be played and what level of individual brilliance was possible on a football pitch.

### Revolutionizing the Striker Position

Ronaldo redefined what a striker could be through his unique combination of physical and technical attributes. His blend of explosive speed, strength, sublime dribbling ability, and clinical finishing was unprecedented.[^75] Unlike traditional strikers who relied primarily on positioning and finishing, Ronaldo could beat multiple defenders in succession, creating goals from seemingly impossible situations. His ability to dribble past defenders with the ball seemingly glued to his feet while maintaining full sprint speed set him apart from every striker before him.[^76]

Former Inter Milan teammate and legendary defender Paolo Maldini said of facing Ronaldo in training: "He was tough, tough, every time we played against each other. And I played against him many times."[^77] José Mourinho, one of football's most successful managers, stated in 2014: "Ronaldo is easily the best player post-Diego Maradona, possibly ever."[^78]

### Historical Comparisons

Ronaldo's playing style drew inevitable comparisons with other Brazilian legends like Pelé and later greats like Ronaldinho. Many football historians and former players consider him the most complete striker in football history.[^79] In 2020, when France Football created the Ballon d'Or Dream Team—an all-time greatest XI—Ronaldo was selected as one of the forwards, cementing his place among football's immortals.[^80]

His World Cup achievements place him in an elite category. With 15 World Cup goals, he held the all-time record from 2006 to 2014.[^81] His 10 goals in World Cup knockout matches remain the highest total of any player in history,[^82] demonstrating his ability to perform in the tournament's most pressure-filled moments.

### Influence on Future Generations

Ronaldo's impact extends far beyond his era, with countless professional footballers citing him as their primary inspiration. Strikers who emerged in the 2000s and 2010s frequently mentioned attempting to emulate aspects of Ronaldo's game. His multifaceted brilliance not only redefined the striker position but also left an indelible influence on generations that followed.[^83]

When discussing the modern greats Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, the Brazilian Ronaldo's name is frequently invoked as the benchmark against which they are measured. His assessment of the Messi-Cristiano debate reflects his diplomatic nature: "I love Messi with the ball at his feet: he scores goals and does all the rest, too. But Cristiano's numbers can't be ignored. It's a cruel comparison. Both of them deserve respect."[^84]

### The "What If" Legacy

Perhaps the most persistent aspect of Ronaldo's legacy is the tantalizing question of what he could have achieved without the devastating knee injuries that robbed him of nearly two years at his physical peak. Former teammates, opponents, and football experts universally agree that the world only witnessed a fraction of Ronaldo's full potential.[^85] Many argue that had he remained injury-free, he would have established records that might never have been broken, potentially establishing himself as the undisputed greatest player in football history.

### Business and Philanthropic Legacy

Beyond the pitch, Ronaldo has built a significant business portfolio. He became the majority owner of Spanish club Real Valladolid in September 2018, purchasing 51% of the club's shares.[^86] In December 2021, he bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro, investing $70 million in an attempt to restore the club to its former glory,[^87] though he sold his stake in April 2024.[^88]

Ronaldo has served as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador since 2000, using his platform to advocate for poverty alleviation and development initiatives.[^89] His work in this capacity has extended his influence beyond football into humanitarian efforts, particularly in developing countries.

### Enduring Popularity

More than a decade after retirement, Ronaldo remains one of football's most beloved figures. His nickname "O Fenômeno" (The Phenomenon) perfectly captures how he was perceived during his prime—a player who seemed to operate on a different plane from everyone else on the pitch.[^90] His story of rising from poverty to become world champion, overcoming career-threatening injuries to achieve redemption, and maintaining grace and humility throughout, ensures his legacy endures not just as a great player, but as an inspiration to millions worldwide.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Football historians, journalists, and fellow professionals consistently rank Ronaldo among the greatest players in the sport's history, with many arguing he was the most naturally gifted striker ever to play the game.

Zlatan Ibrahimović, himself one of the most talented strikers of his generation, stated: "Ronaldo, El Fenomeno. He was so impressive. The way he played, his dribbling, his speed, his technique. For me, he's the best striker that's ever existed."[^91] This sentiment is echoed across generations of players who witnessed his peak years.

Former Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, who faced Ronaldo numerous times in Serie A and internationally, offered high praise: "Ronaldo was a phenomenon. He made the difference on his own, doing things that no one else could do. He was special."[^92] Such assessments from world-class opponents carry particular weight, as they experienced firsthand the impossibility of stopping Ronaldo in full flight.

Scholarly assessments of Ronaldo's career emphasize his revolutionary impact on the striker position. Football historians note that he combined the physical power of traditional center-forwards with the technical brilliance and dribbling ability typically associated with wingers or attacking midfielders.[^93] This hybrid nature made him uniquely devastating and influenced how modern strikers are developed and deployed tactically.

Ronaldo's remarkable comeback from injuries that would have ended most careers is celebrated as one of sport's greatest redemption stories. His 2002 World Cup triumph, where he scored eight goals just two years after doctors questioned whether he would walk normally again, earned him the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year.[^94] Sports psychologists and medical professionals have studied his recovery as an example of mental resilience and determination overcoming seemingly insurmountable physical obstacles.

Defenders who played against Ronaldo, including legends like Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro, have admitted they had no consistent strategy to stop him. Cannavaro remarked that defending against Ronaldo required "luck, prayer, and hoping he wasn't at his best that day."[^95] Such admissions from world-class defenders underscore Ronaldo's unparalleled individual brilliance.

His inclusion in prestigious all-time lists—the FIFA 100 (2004), the Ballon d'Or Dream Team (2020), and multiple halls of fame—reflects the consensus among football authorities that Ronaldo occupies an elite tier in the sport's history.[^96] Contemporary football analysis often describes the pre-injury Ronaldo as potentially the most talented player ever to play the game, with only injuries preventing him from conclusively claiming that title.[^97]

### Negative Views

Despite overwhelming praise, Ronaldo has faced significant criticism from some quarters, particularly regarding questions of dedication, professionalism, and unfulfilled potential.

Critics point to his struggles with weight and fitness in his later career as evidence of insufficient discipline and commitment compared to other elite athletes. The contrast between his physique at Barcelona and Inter Milan versus his final years at Real Madrid and Corinthians led some pundits to question whether he maintained the rigorous training regimens necessary to maximize his career longevity.[^98] While supporters cite his hypothyroidism diagnosis, detractors argue that other players have managed similar conditions without comparable decline.

Some football analysts contend that Ronaldo's injury problems, while undeniably severe, were partially attributable to his explosive playing style and possibly inadequate conditioning or injury prevention measures.[^99] This perspective suggests that better management of his physical development and training load might have prevented or mitigated his knee issues, though such assessments remain speculative and controversial.

The 1998 World Cup final remains a point of contention, with some Brazilian critics arguing Ronaldo should not have played given his condition, and that his insistence on playing potentially cost Brazil the trophy.[^100] While most observers sympathize with the impossible situation Ronaldo faced, some maintain that a fully fit replacement might have given Brazil a better chance of victory.

Ronaldo's personal life controversies, particularly the 2008 scandal involving transgender sex workers, damaged his public image and led some to question his judgment and professionalism.[^101] While such incidents don't diminish his footballing achievements, critics argue they reflect poorly on his character and may have contributed to distractions that affected his performance in later years.

Comparative assessments sometimes unfavorably contrast Ronaldo's career longevity and total goal output with players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, who maintained elite performance levels into their late thirties.[^102] While acknowledging his extraordinary peak, these analyses suggest that truly great players demonstrate both brilliance and sustained excellence over 15-20 years at the highest level, something Ronaldo's injury-interrupted career prevented him from achieving.

Some tactical analysts argue that Ronaldo's individualistic style, while spectacular, occasionally came at the expense of team cohesion, particularly during his later years.[^103] This criticism suggests that his reluctance to adapt his game as his physical abilities declined limited his effectiveness and his teams' overall performance.

Finally, critics of Ronaldo's post-retirement business ventures, particularly his ownership of Real Valladolid and brief involvement with Cruzeiro, have questioned his business acumen and commitment to these projects.[^104] His sale of his Cruzeiro stake after significant investment was viewed by some as abandoning the club when results didn't meet expectations, though supporters argue market conditions and internal politics made his position untenable.
