## Summary

Charles Lyell was a British geologist who popularized the principle of uniformitarianism — the idea that the Earth was shaped by the same slow geological processes that are still operating today. His three-volume 'Principles of Geology' profoundly influenced Charles Darwin and modern earth science. Lyell demonstrated that the Earth is much older than previously thought and that geological change occurs gradually over immense periods.
