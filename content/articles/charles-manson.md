## Summary
Charles Milles Manson led the 'Manson Family' cult in 1960s California. Though he didn't personally commit the murders, he directed followers to carry out the Tate-LaBianca killings of nine people in August 1969. Convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy, he was sentenced to death (commuted to life) and died in prison in 2017.

## Early Life
Born November 12, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to an unmarried 16-year-old mother. He spent most of his childhood in reform schools and prisons. By 32, he had been incarcerated for more than half his life. He learned guitar in prison and developed manipulative skills. [^1]

## Criminal Career
After release in 1967, Manson gathered followers — mostly young women — at Spahn Ranch near LA. He developed 'Helter Skelter,' predicting a race war based on Beatles songs. On August 8-9, 1969, followers murdered five people at Sharon Tate's home. The next night they killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Arrested in October 1969, the Family was connected to the murders through Susan Atkins' jailhouse boasts. Manson and several followers were convicted in 1971. His death sentence was commuted when California abolished capital punishment in 1972. Denied parole 12 times, he died November 19, 2017, of cardiac arrest. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His case increased awareness of cult manipulation dangers [^4]
- Created important legal precedents for conspiracy and joint enterprise liability
- Extensively studied in psychology to understand charismatic manipulation

## Negative Perspectives
- Orchestrated the murders of seven people [^5]
- Manipulated vulnerable young people into committing violence
- Used drugs and psychological control to maintain power
- His 'Helter Skelter' ideology was rooted in white supremacist thinking
