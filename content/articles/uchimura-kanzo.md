## Summary

Uchimura Kanzo was a Japanese Christian leader, author, and founder of the Non-Church Movement (Mukyokai), which rejected Western ecclesiastical structures in favor of a Japanese form of Christianity. He believed that Christianity should be expressed through Japanese culture rather than Western institutional forms. He was a prominent public intellectual who opposed Japanese imperialism and the Russo-Japanese War. His concept of 'two J's' (Jesus and Japan) sought to harmonize faith and patriotism.
