## Overview
On October 6, 1981, President Anwar Sadat was assassinated during a victory parade in Cairo celebrating Operation Badr.

## The Event
As air force planes flew overhead, a group of soldiers led by Khalid Islambouli disembarked from a truck and opened fire on the reviewing stand, throwing grenades. Sadat was killed, along with several dignitaries.

## Context
Sadat had become controversial in the Arab world for signing the Camp David Accords and making peace with Israel, which angered Islamists and Arab nationalists. His deputy, Hosni Mubarak, succeeded him.
