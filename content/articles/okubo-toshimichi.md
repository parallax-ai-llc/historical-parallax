## Summary

Ōkubo Toshimichi (September 26, 1830 – May 14, 1878) was a Japanese statesman and samurai of the Satsuma Domain, regarded as one of the principal architects of modern Japan. One of the "Three Great Nobles" who led the Meiji Restoration in 1868 alongside Kido Takayoshi and Saigō Takamori, Ōkubo served as Home Minister and championed state-led industrialization policies that transformed Japan from a feudal society into a modern nation-state.[^1][^2] His political philosophy, centered on the principle of *fukoku kyōhei* (enrich the country, strengthen the military), and his authoritarian methods have led historians to compare him to Otto von Bismarck of Prussia.[^3][^4] He was assassinated in 1878 by disaffected samurai who accused him of tyranny, yet his legacy as a master of Realpolitik and architect of Japanese modernization endures.

## Early Life and Background

Ōkubo Toshimichi was born on September 26, 1830, in Kajiyamachi, a section of the castle-town of Kagoshima in the Satsuma Domain, on the southern island of Kyushu.[^5] His father, Ōkubo Jūemon (also known as Toshio or Shirō), was a low-ranking samurai serving as a *koshōgumi* (bodyguard) of the Satsuma Domain, receiving less than 150 koku of rice annually, which kept the family in straitened circumstances until his father obtained a minor government position dealing with Ryukyuan affairs.[^6][^7] His maternal grandfather, Minayoshi Hōtoku, was a noted Satsuma physician who had studied Western technology and science, providing intellectual influence within the family. As the only son in a family of seven children, Ōkubo was reared in strict conformity with Satsuma samurai traditions.[^8]

Between the ages of seven and fourteen, Ōkubo attended the *Gochū*, a self-governing association for young boys peculiar to Kagoshima. These institutions guided young Satsuma lads in play, study, and military training under the supervision of older youths, with activities oriented toward fostering military courage and literary proficiency, including the practice of *jūjutsu* and reading Confucian classics, Japanese history, and literature.[^9] As the oldest son of a samurai, Ōkubo was also entitled to attend the Seidō (also known as Zōshikan), a han-operated educational institution. He undertook special training in military arts, studying *jūjutsu* under his uncle Minayoshi Kinroku and spear fighting under Umeda Kyūnojō, though his frail constitution prevented him from excelling.[^10] To compensate for his physical limitations, Ōkubo concentrated on literary pursuits, becoming a voracious reader and studying alongside Saigō Takamori, who was three years his senior.[^11]

At the age of sixteen, Ōkubo's literary accomplishments earned him a position as *kakiyakujo* (archivist's aide) in the Satsuma han's archives.[^12] However, following his father's involvement in a failed political movement in 1849, Ōkubo himself was accused of acting as a messenger between his father and other conspirators, was relieved of his position in the archives, and placed under domiciliary arrest for six months.[^13] This early political setback proved formative, tempering his ambitions with caution and teaching him the importance of careful political maneuvering.

## Rise to Power

The pivotal turning point in Ōkubo's career came in 1858 when Shimazu Nariakira, the progressive daimyo of Satsuma, recognized Ōkubo's talents and appointed him to the position of tax administrator.[^14] Ōkubo shared Nariakira's *kinnō* (reverence for the emperor) views and his advocacy of *kōbu gattai* (union of court and Bakufu), and because he strongly advocated a policy of internal reform and Westernization within Satsuma, he soon became a confidant of the lord.[^15] Nariakira's death in August 1858, just a year after their relationship began, was a significant setback for the progressives, leaving Ōkubo and Saigō without employment and mentor.[^16] This loss pushed Ōkubo toward more radical action to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate.

After Satsuma was defeated in the bombardment of Kagoshima by the British Royal Navy in 1863, Ōkubo realized that cooperation between the court and the shogunate had become impossible and recognized the military superiority of the Western powers.[^17] In 1866, he and Saigō Takamori met Chōshū domain's Kido Takayoshi to forge the secret Satchō Alliance between the two most powerful domains in southwestern Japan with the aim of overthrowing the bakufu, marking the beginning of the Meiji Restoration.[^18][^19] Ōkubo was central to the coup d'état of January 3, 1868, which proclaimed the restoration of imperial rule, and he emerged as a principal architect of the new Meiji state, working during the critical period from 1868 to 1871 to consolidate the government.[^20][^21]

The culmination of these consolidation efforts was the *haihan chiken* (abolition of han and establishment of prefectures) in August 1871. This decisive move, largely orchestrated by Ōkubo, Kido, and Saigō, dismantled the feudal structure and brought the entire country under direct central government control.[^22] On August 24, 1871, the plan was secretly worked out at Kido's residence by seven people from Satsuma and Choshu, fundamentally transforming Japan's political geography.[^23] The reform initially generated over 300 prefectural units before rapid consolidation reduced them to approximately 75 entities by December 1871.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### Political Centralization and Administrative Reforms

Ōkubo's most significant achievement was the centralization of political power in the early Meiji period. As Home Minister from November 29, 1873, to 1878, he advanced the process of political centralization substantially and channeled state energies and resources into economic development.[^25][^26] Appointed to be Home Lord, Ōkubo wielded enormous power through his control of all local government appointments and the police force.[^27] Centralization meant "the abolition of feudal institutions, the conversion of fiefs (han) into prefectures (ken) administered by government appointees, and the appropriation by the center of revenues that had gone to the old warrior elite," with Okubo at the center of this process.[^28]

He carried out reforms such as *hanseki hokan* (the return of lands and people to the Emperor) and *haihan chiken* (the abolition of clans and establishment of prefectures), fundamentally restructuring Japanese governance.[^29] The early 1870s saw the onset of an impressive period of Japanese modernization characterized by the centralization of political power and the growing role of the state as an agent of economic development.[^30]

### Economic Modernization and Industrialization

Ōkubo promoted a policy of rapid, state-sponsored industrialization through the importation of Western technology, the establishment of pilot-plant operations, and government subsidies to key businesses.[^31][^32] His economic philosophy was centered on *fukoku kyōhei* (enrich the country, strengthen the military), with strong government patronage for industrial development to ensure national strength.[^33] As Home Minister, Ōkubo prioritized infrastructure development, including the expansion of railways and telegraph networks, and his 1874 memorandum underscored government responsibility for nurturing industries, reflecting a pragmatic strategy to import Western technologies while leveraging domestic entrepreneurship.[^34]

Ōkubo was not timid about the role of government in promoting economic development, having stated that "the volume of goods produced arises partly from the industriousness of the people, but more fundamentally it must depend upon the guidance and encouragement by the government and its officials."[^35] He focused on a state-led industrialization drive and suppressed several samurai uprisings that challenged the central government, including the Saga and Satsuma Rebellions.[^36]

### Land Tax Reform

The Meiji government's land tax reform, enacted on July 28, 1873, under Ōkubo Toshimichi's oversight as the newly appointed Home Minister, fixed the national land tax at 3 percent of standardized land assessments payable in cash rather than rice, thereby establishing private land ownership.[^37] The land tax reform ordinance shifted taxation from fluctuating crop yields to a standardized 3% levy on assessed land value payable in currency rather than kind, yielding approximately 30 million yen annually by standardizing fiscal extraction and freeing capital for investment while commodifying land ownership.[^38] This reform provided the Meiji government with a stable revenue base to fund modernization efforts.

### The Iwakura Mission (1871-1873)

After serving as councillor and Finance Minister, Ōkubo joined the Iwakura Mission as vice-envoy extraordinary in 1871.[^39] The mission was a Japanese diplomatic voyage to Europe and the United States conducted between 1871 and 1873, with the aim of gaining recognition for the newly reinstated imperial dynasty, beginning preliminary renegotiation of the unequal treaties, and making a comprehensive study of modern industrial, political, military and educational systems.[^40][^41] On December 23, 1871, an expedition of 100 Japanese leaders set sail from Yokohama, with the mission lasting 631 days, including seven months spent in the United States, four in the United Kingdom, and seven on the European continent.[^42][^43]

Ōkubo was deeply impressed by British industrial progress and particularly by his meeting with Otto von Bismarck in Prussia in March 1873. Bismarck's emphasis on national strength and Realpolitik reinforced Ōkubo's own convictions about the path Japan should follow.[^44] The experience reinforced his belief that Japan must prioritize internal modernization before engaging in foreign ventures.[^45] Upon return to Japan on September 13, 1873, Ōkubo became a dominant figure in the Meiji government and championed state-led industrialization policies based on what he had observed during the mission.[^46]

### Foreign Policy and the Korea Debate

In 1873, Ōkubo broke with Saigō Takamori over policy toward Korea in what became known as the Seikanron debate, with Saigō supporting a plan of conquest while Ōkubo argued that priority be given to internal Japanese reform and development.[^47][^48] Ōkubo's "Seven Points Document," dated October 1873, outlined the arguments against invading Korea, arguing that action against Korea was premature because Japan was in the stages of modernizing and an invasion would be far too costly.[^49] His seven-point memorial detailed the risks of war, including civil disturbances, economic bankruptcy, depletion of gold reserves, Russian and English interference, and diversion from treaty revision.[^50] Ōkubo's views prevailed and were adhered to until 1894, long after his death.[^51] The supporters of Korean invasion all resigned from the government in October 1873, resulting in a major split in the Meiji government.[^52]

Despite his opposition to the Korean expedition, Ōkubo, initially focused on internal affairs, was pressured into supporting a punitive expedition to Taiwan in 1874, partly as a diversion for disaffected samurai.[^53] Despite foreign protests and Kido's resignation over the issue, Ōkubo sanctioned the expedition led by Saigō Tsugumichi in May 1874.[^54] When China protested, Ōkubo traveled to Peking in August 1874 as minister plenipotentiary, and through tense negotiations, skillfully using foreign diplomats as intermediaries, secured a settlement in October 1874.[^55] The Taiwan Expedition of 1874 was Japan's first military foray outside of Japan since the formal opening of the country in 1854, and had enormous significance in terms of enabling Japan to stake a claim to being a serious player in international relations.[^56]

### Suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion

Ōkubo, as the central figure in the government, directed the suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion (1877), which, though costly, ultimately crushed the last major feudal resistance to the Meiji regime.[^57] By 1877, Ōkubo's and Saigō's paths had diverged dramatically, with Saigō's intention being to topple the ruling oligarchy headed by Ōkubo.[^58] Ōkubo accompanied the 30,000-strong Imperial Japanese Army to personally oversee the defeat of the Satsuma Rebellion at the final battle of Shiroyama.[^59] The rebellion lasted from January 29 until September 24, 1877, when it was decisively crushed, and its leader, Saigō Takamori, was shot and mortally wounded.[^60] This conflict represented the tragic end of a friendship, with former allies becoming enemies as Japan modernized.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Ōkubo Toshimichi was controversial for his authoritarian methods, and his authoritarian tendencies and concentration of power drew significant criticism.[^61] He used authoritarian political techniques inherited from the feudal past to force the pace of modernization.[^62] Despite being regarded as the progressive driving force behind the new Meiji state, he had an authoritarian and often opportunist style of government.[^63]

### Press Restrictions and Political Suppression

Ōkubo authored restrictive press and libel laws in June 1875 to curb criticism of the government. Press restrictions formalized in laws like the 1875 Press Regulations limited criticism of government policies, with penalties for publications deemed seditious.[^64][^65] Ōkubo's administration responded to agitation demanding assemblies and broader participation by tightening controls, viewing popular assemblies as premature and destabilizing.[^66] He inherited and adapted feudal-era authoritarian techniques, such as hierarchical command structures and surveillance mechanisms, to suppress potential factionalism.[^67]

### Accusations of Despotism

Critics, particularly traditionalist samurai and early liberals, decried these tactics as erosive of liberties, accusing Ōkubo's oligarchy of betraying the Charter Oath's call for deliberative assemblies.[^68] Ōkubo's domination of political authority was criticized as "despotism by a domain-dominated government."[^69] The fact of his assassination and public reaction to it revealed that he was anything but a popular figure in his lifetime.[^70] The assassins justified their deed by charging Ōkubo with suppressing popular rights, monopolizing administrative affairs, promulgating laws arbitrarily, depleting the national treasury, fomenting disorders, and prejudicing Japan's national rights in foreign relations.[^71]

### Break with Saigō Takamori

Ōkubo's break with his lifelong friend Saigō Takamori over the Korean question in 1873 and the subsequent Satsuma Rebellion in 1877 demonstrated the personal costs of his political pragmatism. For Ōkubo Toshimichi, their mutual birthplace — Satsuma — needed to disappear as a political entity, which put him in direct opposition to Saigō's more traditionalist views.[^72] The consensus is that avenging Saigō Takamori's death was an important motivation for Ōkubo's assassination in 1878.[^73]

---

## Personal Life

Ōkubo was married to Hayasaki Masako (also referred to simply as Masuko) in 1857, about whom little is recorded; she outlived him by less than a year, dying in 1878.[^74][^75] His children included Yoshiko (eldest daughter), and sons Hikonoshin (Toshikazu), Nobukuma (who became the statesman Makino Nobuaki), Toshitake, Tatsukuma, Yukuma, Shunkuma, Shichikuma, and Toshikata.[^76] His children from this marriage were Toshikazu, the 1st Marquess Okubo (1859-1945), Makino Nobuaki (1861-1949), Toshitake, later the 2nd Marquess (1865-1943), Ishihara Takeguma (1869-1943), who was adopted by his wife Yaeko's family, and Yoshiko, who married Ijuin Hikokichi.[^77] Additionally, Ōkubo had four illegitimate children by a mistress.[^78]

He took a keen interest in their education, placing two sons in American schools.[^79] It is said that Ōkubo was a very gentle and devoted father to his family. In the short time of 10 to 15 minutes before heading off to the Ministry, he showed affection to his only daughter, Yoshiko, by lifting her in his arms.[^80] Japan's 92nd Prime Minister Tarō Asō is a great-great-grandson of Ōkubo Toshimichi, demonstrating his lasting familial influence on Japanese politics.[^81]

Despite his fearsome reputation as a statesman and his authoritarian methods in government, those close to him described a different side of his character—a man dedicated to his family and capable of warmth in his private life, contrasting sharply with his cold, calculating political persona.

## Legacy

Ōkubo Toshimichi is regarded as one of the most important figures in the Meiji Restoration and the founding of modern Japan, with his unwavering dedication to unifying and strengthening the nation, administrative competence, and far-sighted policies laying the groundwork for Japan's rapid modernization.[^82][^83] His policies, often characterized by realism and a focus on national strength (*fukoku kyōhei*), have led some historians to compare his role in Japan to that of Otto von Bismarck in Prussia.[^84][^85] The only English-language biography is Masakazu Iwata's "Ōkubo Toshimichi: The Bismarck of Japan" (1964), based on research in Japanese materials and considered one of the few scholarly works about a member of the Meiji oligarchy.[^86]

A group of disaffected former samurai assassinated Ōkubo in May of 1878, but by then the pathways of economic development and industrialization had become so entrenched that his associates had no problems moving his program of reforms forward.[^87] Within a hundred years, Japan's income per capita, less than a third that of England in 1870, had caught up with its wealthier Western competitors, and Japan had emerged as the world's second largest economy and one of its foremost technological innovators.[^88]

He was a master of Realpolitik, adapting his methods and ideologies to achieve his overarching goal of a strong, centralized state, though his authoritarian tendencies and concentration of power drew criticism; his leadership during a tumultuous period was crucial for Japan's survival and development.[^89][^90] His leadership during the turbulent early Meiji period was instrumental in transforming Japan from a feudal country into a modern, industrialized nation-state.[^91]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars examining Ōkubo's legacy emphasize his visionary leadership and administrative genius in orchestrating Japan's transformation from feudalism to modernity. His unwavering dedication to unifying and strengthening the nation, his administrative competence, and his far-sighted policies laid the groundwork for Japan's rapid modernization that would position it as a major world power by the early 20th century.[^92] Historians note that at the center of the modernization process stood a reform-minded group of bureaucrats, led by the Home Minister, Ōkubo Toshimichi, who advanced the process of political centralization substantially and channeled state energies and resources into economic development.[^93]

The comparison to Otto von Bismarck is frequently invoked by scholars to understand Ōkubo's approach to nation-building. Like Bismarck, Ōkubo understood that national strength required both economic prosperity and military capability, and he pursued these goals with ruthless pragmatism.[^94] His belief that people should be promoted on the basis of merit rather than family or military connections was matched by his conviction that those who had had foreign training were particularly well-suited to assist him in his efforts to launch Japan in a sustained process of modernization.[^95]

Defenders of Ōkubo argue that the authoritarian measures he employed were necessary given the fragility of the new Meiji state and the resistance from traditionalist forces. The heirs of Ōkubo Toshimichi and Kido Takayoshi, two of the three great nobles of the Meiji Restoration, were ennobled as marquesses in 1884, reflecting the official recognition of his contributions to the nation.[^96] Modern Japanese historians often credit Ōkubo with being the single most important figure in ensuring that the Meiji Restoration resulted in genuine transformation rather than mere political reshuffling.

### Negative Views

Critics of Ōkubo emphasize the moral ambiguities of his methods and the human costs of his policies. Scholars examine not only Ōkubo's policies—finance, foreign affairs, internal modernization—but also the moral ambiguities of his methods: from suppressing domestic revolts to pushing industrialization through authoritarian means, illuminating the interplay of personality, political necessity, and structural change while raising enduring questions about leadership, absolutism, and the costs of modernization.[^97]

The fact of his assassination and public reaction to it revealed that he was anything but a popular figure in his lifetime.[^98] His authoritarian methods, particularly the restrictive press and libel laws of 1875, are seen by some scholars as establishing dangerous precedents for government control over public discourse that would have long-term negative consequences for Japanese democracy.[^99] Critics, particularly traditionalist samurai and early liberals, decried these tactics as erosive of liberties, accusing Ōkubo's oligarchy of betraying the Charter Oath's call for deliberative assemblies.[^100]

The suppression of the Satsuma Rebellion, while politically necessary from the government's perspective, involved the destruction of a significant segment of the traditional samurai class and resulted in the death of thousands, including Ōkubo's former friend and ally Saigō Takamori. Some historians argue that Ōkubo's policies accelerated social dislocation and contributed to the alienation of the samurai class, whose members would later turn to political violence and assassination, including the murder of Ōkubo himself.[^101]

His domination of political authority was criticized as "despotism by a domain-dominated government," and his concentration of power in the Home Ministry created an institutional precedent for centralized bureaucratic control that some scholars argue undermined the development of more democratic institutions.[^102] The assassins' charges—suppressing popular rights, monopolizing administrative affairs, promulgating laws arbitrarily, depleting the national treasury, fomenting disorders, and prejudicing Japan's national rights in foreign relations—while partly motivated by revenge for Saigō, also reflected genuine grievances about Ōkubo's authoritarian governance.[^103]
