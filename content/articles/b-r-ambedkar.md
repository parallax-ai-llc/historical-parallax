## Summary

Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (1891-1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer, and political leader who served as the principal architect of the Constitution of India. Born into the marginalized Dalit Mahar caste, he became one of India's most highly educated citizens, earning doctorates from Columbia University and the London School of Economics. Ambedkar dedicated his life to fighting caste discrimination and championing the rights of India's "untouchables," ultimately renouncing Hinduism and converting to Buddhism in 1956, inspiring millions to follow. His intellectual contributions spanned constitutional law, economics, and social reform, establishing him as one of modern India's most influential figures.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar was born on April 14, 1891, in the military cantonment town of Mhow in Central India (now in Madhya Pradesh). He was the fourteenth and last child of Ramji Maloji Sakpal, an army officer who held the rank of Subedar, and Bhimabai Murbadkar. Born into the Mahar caste, considered one of the "untouchable" communities at the lowest rung of the Hindu caste hierarchy, Ambedkar experienced the brutal realities of caste discrimination from his earliest years.[^3][^4]

After his father's retirement from the army in 1894, the family moved to Satara, where tragedy struck when Bhimrao's mother passed away. Four years later, his father remarried, and the family relocated to Bombay (now Mumbai). Throughout his childhood, Ambedkar faced the stigmas and humiliations of being an untouchable in Indian society. At school, he was segregated from his high-caste classmates, forbidden from touching the same water pitcher, and often made to sit outside the classroom. These experiences of systematic degradation profoundly shaped his consciousness and future mission.[^5]

Despite these obstacles, Ambedkar's father, himself literate and progressive, encouraged his son's education. In 1900, Ambedkar enrolled in the government high school near Satara, and later joined the prestigious Elphinstone High School in Bombay. His academic brilliance became evident early, and in 1907, he passed his matriculation examination, becoming one of the first persons of untouchable origin to reach this milestone. He then entered Elphinstone College, affiliated with the University of Bombay, where he studied economics and political science. By 1912, he had obtained his degree, becoming the first Dalit to obtain a college education in India—an achievement that would open doors previously unimaginable for someone of his caste background.[^6][^7]

The young Ambedkar's intellectual promise attracted the attention of progressive reformers. In 1913, at age 22, he was awarded a prestigious Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 sterling per month for three years by the progressive ruler Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the Maharaja of Baroda. This scholarship enabled him to pursue postgraduate education at Columbia University in New York City, setting him on a path that would transform him into one of the most highly educated Indians of his generation and equip him with the intellectual tools to challenge India's entrenched caste system.[^8]

## Rise to Power

Ambedkar's rise from marginalized untouchable to national leader was built on three pillars: exceptional education, relentless activism, and strategic political engagement. His time at Columbia University from 1913 to 1916 proved transformative. He studied under the renowned economist Edwin Seligman and was deeply influenced by American democratic ideals and the pragmatist philosophy of John Dewey. In 1915, he earned his M.A. in Economics, and the following year was awarded a Ph.D. for his dissertation "The Evolution of Provincial Finance in British India," which was formally conferred in 1927.[^9][^10]

From Columbia, Ambedkar proceeded to the London School of Economics, where he studied under Harold Laski and pursued research in economics and law. In 1923, he was awarded a D.Sc. degree for his thesis "The Problem of the Rupee: Its Origin and Solution," a work that would later significantly influence the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India. He also trained as a barrister at Gray's Inn, London, being called to the Bar in 1923.[^11][^12] This exceptional educational pedigree—unprecedented for an Indian untouchable—gave Ambedkar both credibility and intellectual weaponry to challenge India's social order.

Upon returning to India, Ambedkar attempted to work as a military secretary in the princely state of Baroda but faced such severe caste discrimination that he had to resign within weeks. This experience reinforced his conviction that social reform must precede or accompany political independence. In 1924, he established the Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha (Society for the Welfare of the Excluded) for the social upliftment of marginalized sections, with the powerful motto "Educate, Agitate, Organize."[^13]

Ambedkar's national prominence grew through a series of dramatic public actions challenging caste restrictions. On March 20, 1927, he led the historic Mahad Satyagraha, where thousands of Dalits asserted their right to access the public Chavdar Tank, from which they were traditionally barred. This symbolic act of defiance became a watershed moment in the Dalit rights movement. In 1930, he launched the Kalaram Temple Entry Satyagraha at Nashik, demanding the right for untouchables to enter Hindu temples.[^14][^15]

The British government, seeking Indian participation in constitutional discussions, invited Ambedkar as a representative of the Depressed Classes to the Round Table Conferences in London (1930-1932). There, Ambedkar eloquently argued that untouchables constituted a distinct minority—some 43 million people, or one-fifth of British India's population—separate from caste Hindus and deserving of special political safeguards. He demanded separate electorates for untouchables, which would allow them to elect their own representatives without depending on the votes of caste Hindus.[^16][^17]

This demand brought Ambedkar into direct conflict with Mahatma Gandhi, who opposed separate electorates as dividing Hindu society. When the British granted separate electorates through the Communal Award of 1932, Gandhi launched a "fast unto death" in protest. Under enormous pressure to save Gandhi's life, Ambedkar reluctantly agreed to the Poona Pact on September 24, 1932, which replaced separate electorates with reserved seats within a joint electorate. Though disappointed, Ambedkar secured an increase from 71 to 148 reserved seats for Depressed Classes in provincial legislatures.[^18][^19]

## Major Achievements

Ambedkar's achievements spanned constitutional law, economic policy, social reform, and mass mobilization, making him one of twentieth-century India's most consequential figures.

**Architect of the Indian Constitution**: Ambedkar's crowning achievement was chairing the Drafting Committee of the Constituent Assembly of India, earning him the title "Father of the Indian Constitution." Appointed Law Minister in Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's first cabinet in 1947, Ambedkar brought his vast legal expertise and commitment to equality to bear on the constitution-making process. The Constitution of India, adopted on November 26, 1949, and effective from January 26, 1950, reflects his vision of a democratic, secular republic committed to social justice.[^20][^21]

The Constitution incorporated several revolutionary provisions championed by Ambedkar: the abolition of untouchability (Article 17), the outlawing of all forms of discrimination (Articles 14-15), extensive fundamental rights including freedom of religion, and a comprehensive system of reservations (affirmative action) in government jobs, educational institutions, and legislative bodies for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes. These provisions represented Ambedkar's understanding that formal political equality would be meaningless without concrete measures to address historical injustice and create substantive equality.[^22][^23]

**Economic Contributions**: As an economist, Ambedkar made seminal contributions to Indian economic thought. His doctoral thesis "The Problem of the Rupee" (1923) analyzed currency instability under British rule and proposed sophisticated monetary reforms. On December 15, 1926, Ambedkar presented evidence before the Royal Commission on Indian Currency and Finance. His recommendations significantly influenced the commission's proposals, which were incorporated into the RBI Act of 1934, leading to the establishment of the Reserve Bank of India on April 1, 1935, though Ambedkar received little official credit.[^24][^25]

Ambedkar also championed labor rights, playing a significant role in bringing about the Factories Act of 1946 and the Trade Unions Act of 1947. He conceptualized the creation of the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) and the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) schemes, establishing foundational structures for worker welfare in independent India.[^26]

**Social Reform and Women's Rights**: Beyond his constitutional work, Ambedkar was a tireless advocate for social transformation. He consistently argued that caste discrimination and the subordination of women were interconnected evils of Brahminical Hinduism. As Law Minister, he drafted and introduced the Hindu Code Bill in February 1951, which sought to radically expand women's rights in matters of marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. The bill proved extremely controversial among conservative Hindus, and when it faced obstruction, Ambedkar resigned from Nehru's cabinet in September 1951 in frustration, considering the government's failure to pass comprehensive social reform legislation a betrayal.[^27][^28]

**Conversion to Buddhism**: Ambedkar's most dramatic act of resistance came on October 14, 1956, when he publicly converted to Buddhism in Nagpur, along with approximately 400,000 to 600,000 followers. After decades of fighting within Hinduism for Dalit rights, Ambedkar concluded that the theological foundations of caste discrimination made true equality impossible within Hinduism. In 1935, he had declared, "I was born a Hindu, but I will not die as a Hindu." His conversion to Buddhism—which he interpreted as a rational, egalitarian philosophy without caste—represented both a symbolic rejection of Hindu supremacy and a practical strategy for Dalit liberation. This sparked the Dalit Buddhist movement, with millions subsequently converting. By the 1961 census, over 90% of Maharashtra's 3 million Mahars had become Buddhists.[^29][^30][^31]

**Literary and Intellectual Output**: Ambedkar was a prolific writer and editor. He founded several periodicals including the Marathi fortnightly *Bahishkrit Bharat* (1927) and the English weekly *Janata* (1930). His most influential work, *Annihilation of Caste* (1936), was an undelivered speech that became a devastating critique of the caste system, arguing that inter-caste dining and marriage were insufficient remedies and that the religious foundations of caste must be destroyed. The book remains one of the most powerful anti-caste texts ever written. His final work, *The Buddha and His Dhamma* (1957), published posthumously, articulated his vision of Buddhism as a philosophy for social change.[^32][^33]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his towering achievements, Ambedkar's life and thought have been subject to significant controversies and criticisms, both during his lifetime and in posthumous assessments.

**Conflict with Gandhi and the Nationalist Movement**: Ambedkar's most famous controversy was his bitter conflict with Mahatma Gandhi, whom he saw as a defender of the caste system despite Gandhi's rhetoric about uplifting "Harijans" (God's children), his patronizing term for untouchables. Ambedkar rejected this terminology and Gandhi's approach as paternalistic and inadequate. In *Annihilation of Caste* and other writings, Ambedkar delivered searing critiques not just of the caste system but of Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru's leadership of the independence movement, accusing them of prioritizing political independence while neglecting social revolution.[^34]

Ambedkar has been criticized for his "one-sided views on the issue of caste at the expense of cooperation with the larger nationalist movement." Some historians argue that his focus on caste conflicts diverted energy from the anti-colonial struggle and that his acceptance of British invitations to constitutional conferences made him appear collaborationist. Gandhi and Congress leaders often portrayed Ambedkar as divisive and a tool of British divide-and-rule policies.[^35]

**Views on Hinduism and Islam**: Ambedkar's critique of Hinduism was unsparing and has remained controversial. Scholar Bhikhu Parekh describes Ambedkar's view as "quasi-Manichaean," seeing Hinduism and Hindu society in starkly black-and-white terms without acknowledging reform movements or positive elements. While Ambedkar's critique was rooted in lived experience of oppression, critics argue it sometimes lacked nuance and alienated potential allies in upper-caste reform movements.[^36]

Ambedkar was also critical of Islam, despite Muslims being fellow sufferers of caste Hindu dominance. In his book *Pakistan or the Partition of India* (1940), Ambedkar opposed the creation of Pakistan but also provided detailed criticisms of Islamic society and history, arguing that Islam had its own forms of intolerance and inequality. These views have been controversial, with some seeing them as necessary criticism and others as unfairly harsh.[^37]

**Organizational Weaknesses**: Some biographers have criticized Ambedkar for neglecting organization-building. Despite founding the Independent Labour Party (1936) and the All India Scheduled Castes Federation (1942), these political formations never achieved mass organizational strength comparable to the Indian National Congress. Ambedkar's focus on intellectual and legal work, some argue, came at the expense of building durable grassroots political structures that could sustain the movement beyond his lifetime.[^38]

**Criticism of Communism**: Ambedkar was deeply critical of communism and Marxist movements in India, accusing Communists of "exploiting the workers' cause to advance their own career" according to scholar Christophe Jaffrelot. While Ambedkar championed economic justice, he rejected class-only analyses that ignored caste, arguing that Marxists in India failed to understand the specificity of caste oppression. This put him at odds with leftist movements that might have been natural allies.[^39]

**Electoral Failures**: Ambedkar's political career included significant electoral setbacks. He lost his parliamentary seat in the 1952 general elections, a humiliating defeat that reflected the limited electoral base of explicitly Dalit parties in India's majoritarian system. This defeat highlighted the gap between Ambedkar's intellectual influence and his direct political power.[^40]

**The Poona Pact Debate**: Ambedkar's agreement to the Poona Pact remains controversial. Some Dalit activists argue he should have held firm on separate electorates despite pressure, believing that reserved seats within joint electorates left Dalits dependent on caste Hindu voters and prevented genuine Dalit representation. Others defend the decision as pragmatic given Gandhi's fast and the risk of anti-Dalit violence.[^41]

## Personal Life

Ambedkar's personal life was marked by both traditional arrangements and unconventional choices that reflected his progressive values and the painful toll of his political struggles.

In 1906, at the age of fifteen, Ambedkar was married to nine-year-old Ramabai Bhimrao Ambedkar in a simple ceremony in the vegetable market of Byculla, Mumbai. Such child marriages were customary at the time. Ramabai, born into the Mahar caste, remained largely uneducated but became a pillar of support for Ambedkar during his years of study abroad and political struggle. The couple had five children—sons Yashwant, Gangadhar, Ramesh, and Rajratna, and daughter Indu—though tragically, only Yashwant survived to adulthood, with four children dying in infancy.[^42][^43]

Ramabai's life exemplified sacrifice. She endured extended separations when Ambedkar studied in America and London, faced social ostracism as an untouchable's wife, and lived in difficult economic circumstances despite her husband's education. She supported Ambedkar's relentless work schedule and political activities while managing household responsibilities. On May 27, 1935, Ramabai died after a prolonged illness at the age of 37. Her death deeply affected Ambedkar, who had been traveling for work and political activities. Many accounts suggest the stress of discrimination and poverty contributed to her early death.[^44]

After Ramabai's death, Ambedkar remained unmarried for over a decade, pouring himself into constitutional work and political organizing. However, on April 15, 1948, at age 57, Ambedkar married Dr. Sharada Kabir, a Brahmin medical doctor. Born on January 27, 1909, in Bombay to a Saraswat Brahmin family, Sharada (who took the name Savita Ambedkar after marriage) had completed her MBBS degree from Grant Medical College in 1937, making her one of the few women doctors of her era.[^45]

The marriage was revolutionary for multiple reasons. It was an inter-caste marriage at the highest level of social difference—between an untouchable man and a Brahmin woman—directly challenging the caste system Ambedkar spent his life fighting. Moreover, Savita was 39 at the time of marriage, considerably younger than Ambedkar but past the traditional marriage age. The marriage reflected Ambedkar's commitment to practicing the social revolution he preached.[^46]

Savita became Ambedkar's intellectual companion and caregiver during his final years, which were marked by deteriorating health due to diabetes and other ailments. In the preface to *The Buddha and His Dhamma*, Ambedkar acknowledged that Savita had "increased his life by 8-10 years" through her medical care and companionship. On October 14, 1956, Savita converted to Buddhism alongside Ambedkar in the historic mass conversion at Deekshabhoomi, Nagpur.[^47][^48]

Ambedkar's personality, according to those who knew him, combined fierce intellectual rigor with personal austerity. He was known as a voracious reader who accumulated a personal library of over 50,000 books. His work ethic was legendary—he often worked late into the night on constitutional drafts, legal writings, and social reform projects. The stress of this relentless schedule, combined with the psychological toll of fighting caste discrimination throughout his life, took a severe toll on his health.[^49]

Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar died on December 6, 1956, at his home in Delhi, just three days after completing the manuscript of *The Buddha and His Dhamma*. He was 65 years old. The government of India investigated his death and declared that he died of natural causes, attributed to complications from diabetes and chronic ailments. His death came barely two months after his conversion to Buddhism, preventing him from witnessing the full flowering of the Dalit Buddhist movement he initiated. Savita Ambedkar survived him by nearly 47 years, passing away on May 29, 2003, at age 94 at J.J. Hospital in Mumbai.[^50][^51]

## Legacy

B.R. Ambedkar's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, profoundly shaping modern India's constitutional framework, social movements, and ongoing struggles for equality and justice.

**Constitutional and Legal Legacy**: Ambedkar's most enduring contribution is the Constitution of India itself, which remains the world's longest written constitution and the fundamental legal framework of the world's largest democracy. The constitutional guarantees of equality, the abolition of untouchability, fundamental rights, and the system of reservations (affirmative action) continue to provide legal tools for combating discrimination and promoting social justice. Ambedkar's vision of constitutionalism—using law as an instrument of social transformation—has deeply influenced Indian jurisprudence.[^52]

The reservation system Ambedkar championed has enabled millions of Dalits and other marginalized groups to access education and government employment. While its implementation remains contested and imperfect, it represents one of the world's most extensive affirmative action programs. Ambedkar understood that formal political equality required substantive economic and educational equality, and reservations were his mechanism for achieving this.[^53]

**Social and Political Movements**: Ambedkar became an icon for Dalit assertion and dignity. His slogan "Educate, Agitate, Organize" continues to inspire social movements. Political parties explicitly claiming his legacy, such as the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), have achieved significant power in states like Uttar Pradesh, demonstrating the enduring political mobilization of Dalit communities around Ambedkarite principles.[^54]

Ambedkar's statues are ubiquitous across India, adorning public squares, government buildings, and Dalit neighborhoods. His birthday, April 14, is celebrated as Ambedkar Jayanti, a public holiday in India. Dalits often display his portraits in their homes and workplaces as symbols of pride and resistance. This iconography represents a dramatic reversal—from a caste condemned as "unseeable" to venerating a leader from that caste as a national founding father.[^55]

**Dalit Buddhist Movement**: Ambedkar's conversion to Buddhism initiated a mass religious movement. Millions of Dalits, particularly in Maharashtra, have converted to Buddhism, creating a distinct Navayana ("new vehicle") Buddhist tradition that emphasizes Buddhism's social justice dimensions. Major Buddhist sites associated with Ambedkar, particularly Deekshabhoomi in Nagpur where he converted, have become pilgrimage centers. Buddhist organizations continue to promote Ambedkarite Buddhism as a path of Dalit liberation.[^56][^57]

**Global Influence**: Ambedkar's thought has influenced anti-discrimination struggles worldwide. His analysis of caste as a system of graded inequality has been compared to analyses of race, class, and other forms of social stratification. Scholars in African American studies, critical race theory, and postcolonial studies have engaged with Ambedkar's work. His critique of religious orthodoxy and championship of human rights resonate beyond the Indian context.[^58]

**Educational Institutions**: Numerous universities, colleges, and educational institutions across India bear Ambedkar's name, including Dr. B.R. Ambedkar University in Delhi and Agra, and Ambedkar University in Lucknow. These institutions embody his belief that education is the primary means of empowerment for marginalized communities.[^59]

**Recognition and Honors**: In 1990, Ambedkar was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honor. Retrospectively, the award acknowledged what had been a studied neglect of Ambedkar by the Indian state for decades after his death. UNESCO has recognized his contributions to human rights and social justice. In 2012, Ambedkar was named in Columbia University's list of notable alumni, and his statue stands at the University of London.[^60]

**Economic Ideas**: Though less celebrated than his social and constitutional work, Ambedkar's economic thought—particularly his thesis on the rupee, his advocacy for state-led development, and his support for land reform—influenced India's economic policy in the early independence period. His emphasis on economic rights as preconditions for meaningful political rights anticipated modern human rights frameworks.[^61]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessment of Ambedkar has grown increasingly positive, particularly since the 1990s, with recognition of his intellectual depth and moral courage.

**Constitutional Genius**: Legal scholars widely acknowledge Ambedkar as one of the twentieth century's great constitutional architects. His drafting of the Indian Constitution demonstrated remarkable synthesis of diverse legal traditions—British parliamentary democracy, American fundamental rights, Irish directive principles, and indigenous concerns for social justice. Constitutional law experts praise the Constitution's adaptability and comprehensiveness, crediting Ambedkar's vision.[^62]

Former Indian Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan stated, "Dr. Ambedkar's contribution to the making of the Constitution has made him immortal in the annals of Indian history." The Supreme Court of India regularly invokes Ambedkarite principles when interpreting constitutional provisions on equality and fundamental rights.[^63]

**Social Justice Pioneer**: Historians of social movements recognize Ambedkar as among the first intellectuals globally to articulate a comprehensive theory and practice of caste annihilation. Unlike reformers who sought to ameliorate caste, Ambedkar demanded its complete destruction. Scholar Gail Omvedt writes, "Ambedkar was the first to make clear that caste was not simply about inequality but about a system of graded degradation."[^64]

Feminist scholars increasingly appreciate Ambedkar's championship of women's rights. His drafting of the Hindu Code Bill and persistent advocacy for gender equality—at a time when most Indian male leaders gave these issues secondary importance—mark him as an early intersectional thinker who understood that caste and gender oppression were interconnected.[^65]

**Intellectual Recognition**: Academic assessment of Ambedkar's scholarly work has grown more appreciative. His economic writings, initially dismissed by colonial academia, are now recognized as sophisticated analyses. Modern economists acknowledge his thesis on the rupee was "way ahead of its time and not just academically sound but also morally compelling." His critique of Hinduism, once dismissed as bitter polemic, is now studied as serious religious philosophy and social criticism.[^66]

Columbia University and the London School of Economics now celebrate Ambedkar as among their most distinguished alumni. International conferences on Ambedkar's thought are regularly held, and his works are translated into multiple languages. Scholar Christopher Queen notes Ambedkar's influence on global Buddhism, calling him one of Buddhism's most important modern interpreters.[^67]

**Symbol of Resistance**: For millions of Dalits and other marginalized communities, Ambedkar represents hope, dignity, and the possibility of transformation. Writer Arundhati Roy, in her introduction to *Annihilation of Caste*, writes, "Ambedkar's work is a searing critique not just of caste but of the entire edifice of power in South Asia." His personal journey—from untouchable boy forbidden to touch a water pitcher to architect of India's Constitution—embodies the radical possibility of merit and determination overcoming birth-based hierarchy.[^68]

### Negative Views

Despite widespread veneration, Ambedkar has faced criticism from various quarters, and debates continue about his positions and legacy.

**Hindu Conservative Criticism**: Hindu nationalists and conservatives have long been critical of Ambedkar's denunciations of Hinduism. They argue his critique was overly harsh, ignored reform movements within Hinduism, and was divisive. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and affiliated organizations, while publicly praising Ambedkar to appeal to Dalit voters, historically opposed his anti-Hindu positions and his conversion to Buddhism. Some critics argue Ambedkar's conversion represented a betrayal of Hindu unity against colonial rule.[^69]

**Marxist Critiques**: Leftist scholars have criticized Ambedkar for his rejection of Marxism and his conflicts with Communist movements. They argue that his focus on caste over class was theoretically inadequate and politically divisive, preventing unified working-class struggle. Marxist historians sometimes portray Ambedkar as a liberal reformist rather than a revolutionary, criticizing his faith in constitutional mechanisms rather than mass uprising.[^70]

Indian Communist leader E.M.S. Namboodiripad wrote that Ambedkar "failed to understand the relationship between caste and class," a critique that Ambedkarites reject, arguing that orthodox Marxists failed to understand caste's specificity and autonomy from class relations.[^71]

**Criticism of Political Strategy**: Some critics, including sympathetic scholars, argue that Ambedkar's political strategies were sometimes counterproductive. His formation of separate political parties fragmented opposition to Congress dominance without building sufficient mass base. His acceptance of the Poona Pact is seen by some Dalit activists as a capitulation that weakened untouchable political autonomy. Political scientist Christophe Jaffrelot argues that Ambedkar's "lack of organizational skills" prevented him from translating intellectual influence into sustained political power.[^72]

**Accusations of Elitism**: Some critics argue that Ambedkar's Western education and legalistic approach made him distant from ordinary Dalits' everyday struggles. His emphasis on constitutional reform and education, they suggest, offered little immediate relief to landless agricultural laborers and manual scavengers. This critique, however, is challenged by the mass followings Ambedkar commanded and the concrete benefits reservations have provided.[^73]

**Inter-Dalit Caste Tensions**: Within Dalit communities, some from castes other than Ambedkar's Mahar caste argue that the Dalit Buddhist movement primarily benefited Mahars in Maharashtra while other Dalit castes remained marginalized. This reflects the complexity of "Dalit" as a category encompassing numerous distinct castes with different histories and interests.[^74]

**Contemporary Political Appropriation**: Scholars note the paradox that Ambedkar is now claimed by political parties across the spectrum, including those whose ideologies contradict his principles. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), associated with Hindu nationalism that Ambedkar opposed, has built statues and renamed institutions after him to appeal to Dalit voters. Critics argue this represents a sanitization and depoliticization of Ambedkar's radical critique, reducing him to a safe icon of "national unity" rather than a revolutionary challenging caste-Hindu supremacy.[^75]

Despite these criticisms, the scholarly and popular consensus increasingly recognizes Ambedkar as one of modern India's most important thinkers and one of the twentieth century's great champions of human dignity and equality. His limitations and contradictions are increasingly seen within the context of the enormous structural obstacles he faced and the pioneering nature of his work.
