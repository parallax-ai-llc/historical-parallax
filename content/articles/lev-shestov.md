## Summary

Lev Shestov was a Russian-French existentialist philosopher who was one of the most radical religious thinkers of the 20th century. He challenged the supremacy of reason in philosophy, arguing that faith requires a 'leap' beyond rational thought — what he called 'Athens versus Jerusalem.' His works, including Athens and Jerusalem and Kierkegaard and Existential Philosophy, influenced Camus, Derrida, and others. He argued that God is the God of Abraham, not of the philosophers.
