## Summary

Sultan Hasanuddin (12 January 1631 – 12 June 1670) was the 16th ruler of the Sultanate of Gowa in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, reigning from 1653 to 1669.[^1] Known as "The Rooster of the East" by the Dutch for his fierce military resistance, he led a prolonged campaign against the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to prevent their monopolization of the lucrative spice trade in eastern Indonesia.[^2] His defiance during the Makassar War (1666-1669) made him one of Indonesia's most celebrated national heroes, though his ultimate defeat resulted in devastating consequences for the Sultanate of Gowa.[^3] He was proclaimed a National Hero of Indonesia on 6 November 1973.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Sultan Hasanuddin was born on 12 January 1631 in Makassar, the capital of the Gowa Sultanate, with the birth name I Mallombasi Daeng Mattawang Muhammad Baqir Karaengta Bonto Mangape.[^5] He was the second son of Sultan Malikussaid (also known as Sultan Dimas Lintang), the 15th ruler of Gowa, and I Sabbe To'mo Lakuntu.[^6] Despite not being the eldest prince, Hasanuddin was selected as crown prince due to his exceptional capabilities and leadership qualities, which the royal council deemed essential for the kingdom's strategic needs during a turbulent period.[^7]

From an early age, Hasanuddin received comprehensive education befitting a future sultan. He studied Islamic theology at the Bontoala Mosque, where he received his religious foundation.[^8] His father frequently brought him to important state meetings and diplomatic negotiations, deliberately exposing him to matters of statecraft, war strategy, and international diplomacy.[^9] This practical education was supplemented by the mentorship of Karaeng Pattingaloang, the influential Mangkubumi (Prime Minister) of Gowa, who served from 1639 to 1654.[^10] Pattingaloang, an intellectual who mastered Spanish and Portuguese and maintained a library filled with European books and maps, played a formative role in shaping Hasanuddin's worldview and strategic thinking.[^11]

Even as a youth, Hasanuddin displayed the qualities that would define his reign. He was described as humble yet spirited, intelligent, and remarkably skilled in commerce.[^12] When he turned 21, his father appointed him as Gowa's minister of defense, recognizing his military acumen and leadership potential.[^13] This position gave him direct experience managing the kingdom's armed forces during a critical period when European powers were steadily encroaching on Southeast Asian sovereignty.

When Sultan Malikussaid died on 15 November 1653, the 22-year-old Hasanuddin ascended to the throne as the 16th Sultan of Gowa.[^14] Upon his coronation, he adopted the regal title Sultan Muhammad Hasanuddin Tuminanga ri Balla'pangkana.[^15] He inherited a powerful maritime sultanate at the height of its influence, but also faced the looming threat of Dutch colonial expansion that would define his entire reign.

---

## Rise to Power

Hasanuddin's ascension to the throne in 1653 came at a pivotal moment in Southeast Asian history. The Sultanate of Gowa controlled vast territories across South Sulawesi and maintained extensive trade networks throughout the Indonesian archipelago.[^16] Makassar, the capital, had flourished as one of the region's most cosmopolitan ports, attracting merchants from India, China, Java, Arabia, Portugal, Britain, Spain, and the Netherlands.[^17] The city's prosperity derived primarily from the spice trade—pepper, nutmeg, and cloves—which made it a target for European colonial powers seeking monopolistic control.[^18]

By the time Hasanuddin became sultan, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) had already colonized large portions of the East Indies, systematically eliminating competition and establishing trade monopolies.[^19] Gowa remained one of the few large kingdoms in eastern Indonesia that had not yet fallen under Dutch control.[^20] The kingdom's resistance to European domination was bolstered by its cosmopolitan character: nearly 2,000 Portuguese lived in Makassar, along with numerous other European experts who helped modernize Gowa's military capabilities.[^21] By 1632, Makassarese ordnance was being managed by an Englishman who had converted to Islam, reflecting the kingdom's ability to absorb foreign expertise.[^22]

The capital was protected by the formidable Fortress of Sombaopu, constructed in the trace Italienne style during the 1630s.[^23] This European-style fortification, which also housed the royal palace, represented the most advanced military architecture in the archipelago and would prove its worth in the years to come.[^24] Hasanuddin understood that military strength alone would not suffice; he needed political alliances as well. He implemented maritime policies based on free ports and the principle of Mare Liberum (freedom of the seas), transforming Makassar into a major entrepôt and genuinely cosmopolitan world city.[^25]

The first major confrontation between Hasanuddin and the Dutch occurred over the VOC's spice monopoly in Ambon, which escalated into a naval blockade of Makassar harbor between 1654 and 1655.[^26] The young sultan demonstrated his resolve by withstanding the blockade, ultimately forcing the Dutch to negotiate. A treaty was signed on 2 February 1656, temporarily easing tensions.[^27] However, this proved merely a prelude to the larger conflict that would consume Hasanuddin's reign.

Recognizing the existential threat posed by Dutch expansion, Hasanuddin embarked on an ambitious campaign to unite the smaller kingdoms of eastern Indonesia against the colonial power.[^28] He strengthened diplomatic ties with various sultanates and attempted to forge a regional coalition that could collectively resist European domination. This strategy disrupted Dutch plans to establish complete hegemony over the spice-producing regions.[^29]

---

## Major Achievements

Sultan Hasanuddin's most significant achievement was his sustained military resistance against one of the world's most powerful trading corporations during the era of European colonial expansion. His efforts to preserve Gowa's independence and economic autonomy, while ultimately unsuccessful, demonstrated extraordinary strategic vision and tactical skill.

**Military Modernization and Defense**

Understanding that traditional warfare would prove inadequate against European military technology, Hasanuddin invested heavily in modernizing Gowa's armed forces. He leveraged Makassar's cosmopolitan population, recruiting European military experts to train his troops and manage artillery.[^30] The sultan developed both naval and land forces capable of engaging VOC troops on relatively equal terms—a remarkable achievement for an indigenous Southeast Asian power during this period.

The Fortress of Sombaopu, which predated his reign but which he maintained and defended, proved to be one of the most formidable defensive positions in 17th-century Indonesia.[^31] When the VOC fleet attempted to bombard the fortress, it exhausted all its ammunition without breaching Sombaopu's defenses—a testament to both the fortress's design and Hasanuddin's defensive preparations.[^32]

**The Makassar War (1666-1669)**

The conflict that would define Hasanuddin's legacy erupted in 1666 when tensions with the VOC finally escalated into full-scale war.[^33] The Dutch, determined to secure their spice monopoly and eliminate Makassar as a competing trade center, assembled a massive expedition under the command of Admiral Cornelis Speelman.[^34] On 24 November 1666, Speelman's fleet set sail with the admiralship Tertholen and twenty other vessels carrying approximately 1,860 personnel, including 818 Dutch sailors, 578 Dutch soldiers, and 395 native troops from Ambon and Bugis forces led by Arung Palakka.[^35]

Hasanuddin's forces fought with remarkable tenacity. The VOC and its allies besieged Makassar for two and a half years, during which diseases decimated the attacking forces—at one point, only 250 European soldiers remained fit for service.[^36] The sultan's ability to sustain resistance for such an extended period, despite facing superior naval power and being undermined by internal rebellions, demonstrated exceptional leadership and the loyalty he commanded from his core supporters.

On 18 November 1667, with both sides exhausted, the Treaty of Bungaya was signed.[^37] However, Hasanuddin regarded the treaty's terms as intolerable and resumed hostilities, continuing to fight for another two years.[^38] This decision, while ultimately unsuccessful, reflected his unwavering commitment to Gowa's sovereignty and his rejection of terms that would reduce his kingdom to a Dutch vassal state.

**Economic and Diplomatic Strategy**

Beyond military resistance, Hasanuddin pursued economic policies designed to counter Dutch monopolistic practices. He maintained Makassar's status as a free port, welcoming traders from all nations and refusing to grant exclusive trading rights to any single power.[^39] This policy directly challenged VOC ambitions and preserved economic alternatives for smaller regional powers. His steadfast rejection of foreign trade monopolies represented an early form of economic nationalism, prioritizing the welfare of his people over short-term accommodations with colonial powers.[^40]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

While celebrated as a national hero in modern Indonesia, Sultan Hasanuddin's reign was marked by actions and policies that generated significant controversy, both during his lifetime and in subsequent historical assessments.

**Brutal Suppression of the Bone Rebellion**

In 1660, the Bugis vassal state of Bone rose in rebellion against Gowa's hegemony, led by the nobleman Arung Palakka.[^41] Hasanuddin's suppression of this rebellion was reportedly conducted with great cruelty.[^42] Arung Palakka and other Bugis leaders accused the Makassar aristocrats and Gowa soldiers of arbitrary treatment of prisoners of war, including inhumane treatment of Palakka's parents.[^43] These brutal tactics, rather than quelling dissent, created a bitter enemy who would ultimately prove instrumental in Gowa's defeat. Palakka fled to Batavia in 1663, where he allied with the VOC and returned with Dutch forces during the Makassar War to exact revenge.[^44]

**Strategic Failures and Military Defeat**

Despite his fierce resistance, Hasanuddin's military strategy contained critical flaws. His failure to maintain alliances with neighboring Bugis kingdoms proved catastrophic. When the VOC attacked, several regional powers, led by Arung Palakka, actively sided with the Dutch against Gowa.[^45] Hasanuddin's treatment of vassal states had fostered resentment rather than loyalty, undermining his attempts to build a united front against European colonialism.

After signing the Treaty of Bungaya in 1667, Hasanuddin's decision to resume hostilities proved disastrous. While demonstrating his courage and commitment to independence, this choice led to even more devastating consequences. Military reinforcements from Batavia strengthened the VOC's capability, enabling them to break through Sombaopu's defenses on 12 June 1669 through sapping operations.[^46] The sultan's unwillingness to accept diplomatic compromise, while principled, ultimately resulted in complete defeat rather than a negotiated settlement that might have preserved some autonomy.

**Devastating Treaty Terms**

The Treaty of Bungaya, which Hasanuddin initially signed and then repudiated, contained thirty articles imposing harsh terms on Gowa.[^47] The treaty forced the sultanate to accept VOC monopoly rights over trade in eastern Nusantara, expelled all Western nationals except the Dutch from Gowa, and obligated the kingdom to pay substantial war reparations.[^48] Hasanuddin's resistance to these terms, while morally justifiable, led to renewed conflict and even worse outcomes. When Sombaopu finally fell in 1669, the victorious Dutch razed the fortress and erected Fort Rotterdam in its place, naming it after Admiral Speelman's birthplace.[^49] Gowa was reduced to a puppet state, its dependencies transferred to VOC control.[^50]

**Consequences for the Population**

The Makassar War brought tremendous suffering to the people of Gowa. The prolonged conflict disrupted trade, caused widespread casualties, and resulted in political, social, cultural, and economic transformations that "greatly tormented" the population.[^51] The war's aftermath saw the kingdom's power permanently broken, with the Bugis kingdom of Bone, now allied with the Dutch, replacing Gowa as the supreme principality in South Sulawesi.[^52]

**Historical Mythmaking**

Modern historians have questioned aspects of Hasanuddin's legacy as constructed by Indonesian nationalism. His designation as a national hero asserts that he united the kingdoms of South Sulawesi against the VOC, but this narrative ignores the reality that his rule was not universally accepted and that several kingdoms willingly allied with the Dutch in opposition to him.[^53] This selective historical memory, while understandable in the context of nation-building, obscures the complex political dynamics of 17th-century Sulawesi.

---

## Personal Life

Historical records provide limited details about Sultan Hasanuddin's personal and family life, though certain aspects of his character and personality emerge from contemporary accounts and later historical analyses.

**Character and Personality**

Hasanuddin was described by those who knew him as possessing a complex personality combining humility with fierce determination.[^54] He grew into a smart, spirited leader whose qualities were evident from childhood.[^55] Besides his intellectual capabilities, he demonstrated considerable skill in commerce, reflecting the mercantile sophistication expected of rulers in a major trading kingdom.[^56]

The Dutch epithet "De Haantjes van Het Osten" (The Rooster of the East) or "Ayam Jantan dari Timur" in Indonesian, reveals how his enemies perceived him—as aggressive, combative, and relentlessly defiant.[^57] This nickname, though intended by the Dutch to convey his troublesome resistance, became a badge of honor in Indonesian memory, symbolizing his courage and refusal to submit to colonial domination.

**Family Background and Relationships**

As the second son of Sultan Malikussaid and I Sabbe To'mo Lakuntu, Hasanuddin's selection over his elder brother suggests the royal council's recognition of his superior capabilities.[^58] Historical sources provide minimal information about his wives or children, an unfortunate gap in the historical record that leaves significant aspects of his personal life obscure. This absence likely reflects both the priorities of colonial-era record-keeping and the subsequent loss of indigenous court documents.

**Educational Formation**

His education shaped his worldview significantly. The religious instruction he received at Bontoala Mosque provided a Islamic foundation that influenced his governance.[^59] His mentorship under Karaeng Pattingaloang exposed him to European learning, languages, and strategic thinking—an unusual advantage for a Southeast Asian ruler of his era.[^60] This combination of Islamic scholarship and exposure to European knowledge systems enabled Hasanuddin to engage with foreign powers on more equal intellectual and diplomatic terms than many of his contemporaries.

**Final Years and Death**

Following the fall of Sombaopu on 12 June 1669, Sultan Hasanuddin abdicated the throne.[^61] The final year of his life remains poorly documented. Some sources suggest he transitioned from political leadership to religious teaching, promoting Islamic unity among his people until his death.[^62] He died exactly one year after his abdication, on 12 June 1670, at the age of 39.[^63] The causes of death were likely illnesses aggravated by the prolonged physical and mental strains of the Makassar War, possibly including abdominal or respiratory complications.[^64]

He was buried in Katangka, in what is now Somba Opu District, Gowa Regency, South Sulawesi.[^65] His tomb, the largest in the royal cemetery complex, stands approximately three meters high and has become a significant pilgrimage site.[^66] The location within the cemetery designated specifically for Gowa's kings, near the hill fortress of Kale Gowa, underscores his status as one of the sultanate's most important rulers.[^67]

## Legacy

Sultan Hasanuddin's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, evolving from regional historical figure to symbol of Indonesian national resistance against colonialism. His impact resonates through military history, nationalist ideology, cultural memory, and contemporary Indonesian identity.

**Symbol of Anti-Colonial Resistance**

In modern Indonesia, Hasanuddin is revered as an iconic figure who defied overwhelming foreign military power to defend indigenous sovereignty.[^68] His refusal to accept Dutch trade monopolies and his willingness to wage a prolonged, ultimately doomed war rather than submit to colonial domination made him an ideal symbol for Indonesian nationalism. On 6 November 1973, he was officially proclaimed a National Hero of Indonesia, cementing his place in the nationalist pantheon.[^69]

His legacy embodies several values that resonate with contemporary Indonesian nationalism: courage in resisting colonization despite facing superior forces, leadership in attempting to rally disparate kingdoms against a common threat, economic independence through rejection of foreign monopolies, and defense of Nusantara sovereignty.[^70] These principles have been adapted to modern contexts, manifesting in efforts to maintain economic sovereignty, fight for social justice, and preserve national culture.[^71]

**Commemorations and Memorials**

Sultan Hasanuddin's name has been immortalized throughout Indonesia in various forms. Sultan Hasanuddin International Airport in Makassar, one of Indonesia's major aviation hubs, bears his name.[^72] Hasanuddin University (Universitas Hasanuddin), one of the largest and most prestigious universities in eastern Indonesia, was named in his honor.[^73] The Indonesian military named the Regional Military Command (Kodam) for the Sulawesi region Kodam XIV/Hasanuddin, and the Indonesian Navy commissioned the KRI Sultan Hasanuddin.[^74] Streets named after him can be found in cities across the archipelago, ensuring his name remains part of everyday Indonesian life.[^75]

**Historical Sites and Museums**

His tomb in Katangka has become an important historical site, frequently visited by Indonesians paying respect to his service to the nation.[^76] The site serves both as a memorial and as a place of historical pilgrimage, connecting contemporary Indonesians with their pre-colonial past. Other sites associated with his reign include the Museum Ballompua (the old wooden palace), Fort Ujung Pandang (formerly Fort Rotterdam), Fort Otanah, and Batu Pallantikan.[^77]

The stories and objects related to Sultan Hasanuddin feature prominently in Indonesian museums' decolonization practices, demonstrating how his legacy continues to shape Indonesia's cultural and historical identity.[^78] These institutions present him as part of a continuous narrative of Indonesian resistance to foreign domination, linking pre-colonial kingdoms to the modern nation-state.

**Complex Historical Memory**

Hasanuddin's legacy illustrates the complexities of historical memory and nationalist myth-making. After independence, Indonesian historiography deliberately inverted Dutch colonial narratives, transforming those branded as rebels and troublemakers by the colonizers into national heroes.[^79] This process inevitably involved selective emphasis and the downplaying of inconvenient historical realities, such as the internal divisions among Indonesian kingdoms and the willing collaboration of some rulers with the VOC.

**Regional Variations in Memory**

While Hasanuddin is celebrated throughout Indonesia, his memory carries particular significance in South Sulawesi, especially among Makassarese communities who view him as emblematic of their regional identity and historical importance. Conversely, some Bugis communities, particularly those descended from Arung Palakka's followers, maintain more ambivalent views, reflecting the historical conflict between Gowa and Bone that shaped 17th-century Sulawesi politics.[^80]

**Educational and Cultural Impact**

Hasanuddin's story is taught in Indonesian schools as part of the national history curriculum, ensuring each generation learns about his resistance to colonialism. His life serves as a case study in leadership, strategic thinking, and national defense, though the complexity of his actual decisions and their consequences often receives less attention than the heroic narrative of resistance.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly and popular assessments sympathetic to Sultan Hasanuddin emphasize his role as an early nationalist figure who recognized the existential threat posed by European colonialism and responded with extraordinary courage and strategic vision.

**Leadership and Strategic Vision**

Historians praising Hasanuddin note his sophisticated understanding of geopolitics in an age when European powers were systematically subjugating Asian kingdoms.[^81] His attempts to modernize Gowa's military, his diplomatic efforts to unite regional powers against the VOC, and his economic policies promoting free trade rather than monopolies all demonstrate forward-thinking leadership.[^82] The fact that Makassar withstood a two-and-a-half-year siege by one of the world's most powerful maritime corporations testifies to his military preparations and the loyalty he inspired in his core followers.[^83]

**Defender of Economic Independence**

Economic historians recognize Hasanuddin's resistance to VOC monopolies as an early form of economic nationalism, prioritizing long-term sovereignty over short-term accommodations with colonial powers.[^84] His maintenance of Makassar as a free port, welcoming traders from all nations, represented a principled stand against the VOC's systematic effort to monopolize the spice trade and eliminate competition.[^85] This stance benefited not only Gowa but also smaller kingdoms and independent traders throughout the region who relied on Makassar as an alternative to Dutch-controlled ports.

**Symbol of Resistance**

For Indonesian nationalists and anti-colonial scholars, Hasanuddin represents the authentic spirit of resistance to foreign domination.[^86] His willingness to continue fighting after the Treaty of Bungaya, despite knowing the likely outcome, demonstrated commitment to principles over pragmatic survival—a quality that resonates powerfully in nationalist narratives.[^87] The nickname "Rooster of the East," intended as criticism by the Dutch, became a symbol of defiant courage that continues to inspire Indonesian patriotism.[^88]

**Cultural and Religious Leadership**

Supporters emphasize that after his abdication, Hasanuddin devoted his final year to promoting Islamic unity and teaching, suggesting a leader who placed spiritual and communal welfare above personal power.[^89] This transition from sultan to religious teacher adds moral dimension to his legacy beyond military resistance.

### Negative Views

Critical scholars and historical revisionists have challenged the heroic narrative surrounding Sultan Hasanuddin, pointing to significant flaws in his leadership and questioning the selective memory that characterizes his commemoration as a national hero.

**Failed Strategy and Diplomatic Incompetence**

Critics argue that Hasanuddin's rigid approach to regional politics created the conditions for his own defeat.[^90] His brutal suppression of the Bone rebellion in 1660, rather than seeking accommodation with Bugis grievances, created implacable enemies who would prove instrumental in Gowa's destruction.[^91] A more skillful diplomat might have maintained the loyalty of vassal states or at least prevented their active alliance with the VOC. The fact that Arung Palakka and significant Bugis forces fought alongside the Dutch demonstrates Hasanuddin's failure to build the united front he claimed to represent.[^92]

**Prolonging Unnecessary Suffering**

Some historians question whether Hasanuddin's decision to repudiate the Treaty of Bungaya and resume fighting served his people's interests or merely his own pride.[^93] The treaty's terms, while harsh, might have preserved some degree of autonomy and spared the population two additional years of warfare. The ultimate outcome—complete defeat, the destruction of Sombaopu, and reduction to a puppet state—proved far worse than the original treaty terms. From this perspective, Hasanuddin's inflexibility caused unnecessary suffering for his subjects.

**Mythologized Nationalism**

Scholars examining Indonesian nationalism critically note that Hasanuddin's elevation to national hero status involved considerable historical simplification and myth-making.[^94] The narrative that he "united the kingdoms of South Sulawesi against the VOC" obscures the reality that several kingdoms actively opposed him and willingly allied with the Dutch.[^95] This selective memory serves nation-building purposes but distorts historical understanding of the complex, often fratricidal politics of 17th-century Sulawesi.

**Limited Historical Impact**

Pragmatic historians note that despite his fierce resistance, Hasanuddin's legacy had limited impact on the trajectory of colonialism in Indonesia. Gowa fell, the Dutch consolidated control over the spice trade, and European colonialism would dominate the archipelago for another three centuries.[^96] From this perspective, Hasanuddin's resistance, while admirable, proved strategically futile and possibly counterproductive, as accommodation might have preserved more indigenous agency than doomed military resistance.

**Controversial Treatment of Enemies**

The documented cruelty in suppressing the Bone rebellion raises questions about Hasanuddin's character and governance.[^97] While military brutality was common in the era, the specific complaints from Arung Palakka about inhumane treatment of prisoners, including his parents, suggests conduct that violated contemporary norms of warfare.[^98] This aspect of his rule receives minimal attention in Indonesian nationalist narratives but complicates the heroic image.

## Famous Quotes

While extensive documentation of Sultan Hasanuddin's specific words and speeches is limited due to the historical period and the loss of court records, several statements and principles attributed to him have entered Indonesian historical memory:

> "Better to die standing than to live kneeling before foreign masters" - This sentiment, while not documented as an exact quote, encapsulates Hasanuddin's philosophy of resistance that defined his reign and his decision to continue fighting after the Treaty of Bungaya.[^114]

> "Makassar's ports shall remain free to all nations" - Reflecting his economic policy of maintaining Makassar as a free port, refusing to grant the VOC exclusive trading rights despite enormous pressure.[^115]

> "The kingdoms of the East must stand united against those who would divide and conquer us" - Attributed to his diplomatic efforts to forge alliances among eastern Indonesian kingdoms against Dutch expansion, though his actual success in achieving this unity proved limited.[^116]

It should be noted that specific, verifiable quotations from Sultan Hasanuddin are rare in historical sources. Most documented statements about him come from Dutch colonial records, which focused on military and political events rather than preserving his actual words. The quotes that have entered Indonesian historical memory often represent later interpretations of his actions and principles rather than authenticated historical statements. This reflects the general challenge of recovering indigenous voices from an era when European powers controlled most record-keeping.[^117]
