## Summary

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) was an Austrian composer widely regarded as one of the greatest musical geniuses in history. A child prodigy who began composing at age 5, Mozart produced over 600 works in his brief 35 years—symphonies, operas, concertos, chamber music, and choral works of extraordinary variety and perfection. His operas (*The Marriage of Figaro*, *Don Giovanni*, *The Magic Flute*) remain staples of the repertoire. Mozart's music is celebrated for its melodic beauty, formal elegance, and emotional depth. His early death, mysterious circumstances, and unmarked grave have added romantic legend to his already remarkable story. Mozart influenced virtually every composer who followed and remains central to Western classical music.

Died in Vienna, age 35. Cause debated:

## Famous Quotes

> "Neither a lofty degree of intelligence nor imagination nor both together go to the making of genius. Love, love, love, that is the soul of genius."

> "The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between."

> "I pay no attention whatever to anybody's praise or blame. I simply follow my own feelings."

> "To talk well and eloquently is a very great art, but an equally great one is to know the right moment to stop."
