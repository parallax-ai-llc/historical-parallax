## Summary

Ulysses S. Grant was the commanding general of the Union Army who led the North to victory in the American Civil War and later served as the 18th President of the United States from 1869 to 1877.[^1] Born Hiram Ulysses Grant in Point Pleasant, Ohio, he graduated from West Point in 1843 and rose to become one of America's greatest military leaders through his aggressive tactics and relentless pursuit of Confederate forces.[^2] As president, Grant championed civil rights for African Americans and fought against the Ku Klux Klan, though his administration was marred by numerous corruption scandals involving his appointees.[^3] Despite personal integrity, his presidency became synonymous with political corruption, earning the term "Grantism," yet modern historians have begun reassessing his legacy, particularly his efforts on behalf of civil rights.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Ulysses S. Grant was born on April 27, 1822, in Point Pleasant, Ohio, to Jesse Root Grant and Hannah Simpson Grant, who had married on June 24, 1821.[^5] He was christened Hiram Ulysses Grant, though a clerical error at West Point would later change his name permanently to Ulysses S. Grant.[^6] His father Jesse was a tanner who had worked his way up from poverty, and the family moved to Georgetown, Ohio, in 1823, where young Ulysses grew up alongside five siblings: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary.[^7]

From an early age, Grant demonstrated an extraordinary ability with horses that would serve him throughout his military career.[^8] Unlike his father's expectations that he would join the tanning business, young Grant found the work distasteful and instead developed his skills in horsemanship, which his father encouraged by giving him work driving supply wagons and transporting people.[^9] This aversion to his father's trade would shape his future path, though it created tensions within the family.

Grant's formal education began at age five when he started at a subscription school, later attending two private schools in Georgetown.[^10] During the winter of 1836-1837, he studied at Maysville Seminary, and in autumn 1838, he attended John Rankin's academy, where he received a more classical education.[^11] His academic performance was unremarkable, showing particular weakness in grammar and spelling that would persist throughout his life, though he excelled in mathematics and demonstrated a quiet determination that would later define his military career.

In spring 1839, at his father's request, Representative Thomas L. Hamer nominated Ulysses to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.[^12] Grant was accepted on July 1, though unfamiliar with the young man, Hamer mistakenly listed his name as "Ulysses S. Grant" rather than Hiram Ulysses Grant, believing his middle name was Simpson (his mother's maiden name).[^13] Rather than correct the error, Grant accepted the new name, reportedly relieved to avoid the initials "H.U.G." that had subjected him to teasing.[^14] He graduated from West Point in 1843, finishing twenty-first out of thirty-nine cadets in his class, a middling performance that gave little indication of his future military brilliance.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Grant's rise to prominence began modestly with service in the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), where he served under Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott.[^16] Though he later described the Mexican War as "one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation," his experiences under these commanders taught him valuable lessons in military strategy and leadership that he would later apply with devastating effectiveness.[^17] Following the war, Grant married Julia Dent on August 22, 1848, at her family's estate in St. Louis, though his father refused to attend because the Dents were slaveholders, deepening the rift between Grant and his father.[^18]

The years between the Mexican War and the Civil War proved difficult for Grant. Assigned to remote posts in the Pacific Northwest and separated from his family, he struggled with loneliness and reportedly developed problems with alcohol.[^19] In 1854, facing a choice between facing charges for drunkenness or resigning, Grant left the army and returned to his family at White Haven, his wife's family plantation.[^20] The following years brought financial hardship as Grant failed at farming, firewood sales, and real estate, eventually taking a clerk position at his father's leather goods store in Galena, Illinois, in 1860.[^21]

The outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 transformed Grant's fortunes. Initially working to organize and train volunteer troops in Illinois, his West Point education and Mexican War experience made him valuable despite his previous failures.[^22] He was appointed colonel of the 21st Illinois Infantry in June 1861, and quickly promoted to brigadier general in July through the influence of Illinois Congressman Elihu B. Washburne.[^23] His first command demonstrated the aggressive, decisive style that would become his trademark, as he whipped an undisciplined volunteer regiment into an effective fighting force through firm but fair leadership.

Grant's breakthrough came in February 1862 with his capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee, the first significant Union victories of the war.[^24] When Confederate commander Simon Bolivar Buckner requested terms of surrender at Fort Donelson, Grant replied with his famous demand for "unconditional and immediate surrender," earning him the nickname "Unconditional Surrender Grant" and making him a Northern hero.[^25] These victories gave the Union control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers, opening the pathway to the Confederate heartland and demonstrating Grant's understanding that the war would be won through aggressive offensive action rather than defensive maneuvering.[^26]

Following the costly but strategically important victory at Shiloh in April 1862, Grant orchestrated the Vicksburg Campaign in 1863, which many historians consider a masterpiece of military strategy.[^27] After months of failed approaches, Grant boldly moved his army down the west bank of the Mississippi, crossed the river below Vicksburg, and cut loose from his supply lines to live off the land—a risky maneuver that allowed him to maneuver freely and ultimately capture the heavily fortified city on July 4, 1863.[^28] Combined with the Union victory at Gettysburg on July 3, the fall of Vicksburg marked the turning point of the war, splitting the Confederacy in two and giving the Union complete control of the Mississippi River.[^29]

Grant's success at breaking the Confederate siege of Chattanooga in November 1863, particularly the dramatic assaults on Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge, convinced President Abraham Lincoln that he had finally found a general who could win the war.[^30] In March 1864, Lincoln promoted Grant to lieutenant general—the first person to hold that rank since George Washington—and gave him command of all Union armies.[^31] Grant moved his headquarters to the field with the Army of the Potomac in Virginia, determined to personally oversee the campaign against Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia while coordinating operations across all theaters of war.[^32]

## Major Achievements

Grant's most significant military achievement was developing and executing the strategy that won the Civil War. Unlike previous Union commanders who sought to capture Confederate territory or inflict single decisive defeats, Grant understood that the war would only end when the Confederate armies were destroyed as fighting forces.[^33] His strategy of coordinated offensives across multiple theaters prevented Confederate forces from shifting troops to threatened areas, while his willingness to accept heavy casualties in pursuit of strategic objectives—though earning him the grim nickname "the Butcher"—reflected his recognition that the numerically superior Union could replace losses while the Confederacy could not.[^34]

The Overland Campaign of 1864 exemplified Grant's relentless approach. From May to June 1864, he engaged Lee's army in a series of brutal battles—the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Court House, Cold Harbor—that cost tens of thousands of Union casualties.[^35] However, unlike previous commanders who would have retreated after such losses, Grant continuously maneuvered southward, forcing Lee into an increasingly defensive posture and gradually depleting Confederate manpower.[^36] "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer," Grant wrote, a statement that captured his determination and helped maintain Northern morale despite the horrific casualties.[^37]

Grant's siege of Petersburg and Richmond from June 1864 to April 1865 demonstrated his ability to adapt tactics to circumstances. Unable to defeat Lee's army in open battle, Grant besieged the Confederate capital, gradually extending his lines westward to cut Lee's supply lines and prevent Confederate forces from shifting to other threatened areas.[^38] This grinding campaign of attrition proved exactly what was needed to defeat the Confederacy, as Lee's army slowly starved and deserted while Sherman's army marched through Georgia and the Carolinas.[^39] When Lee finally abandoned Petersburg and Richmond in April 1865, Grant's relentless pursuit prevented the Confederate army from escaping to continue guerrilla warfare, culminating in Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865.[^40]

At Appomattox, Grant demonstrated the magnanimity that would characterize his approach to reconciliation. He offered generous terms to Lee's army: Confederate soldiers could return home on parole with their personal possessions, officers could keep their sidearms, and any soldier who owned a horse or mule could take it home for spring planting.[^41] Grant prevented his troops from celebrating Lee's surrender, reportedly saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again."[^42] This gracious approach helped begin the process of national healing, though Grant would later fight to ensure that reunion did not come at the expense of African American rights.

As president from 1869 to 1877, Grant achieved significant accomplishments that have only recently received appropriate historical recognition. He stabilized the post-war economy, supported congressional Reconstruction, and used federal power to protect African American rights more aggressively than any other nineteenth-century president.[^43] Grant advocated for and secured ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibited denying voting rights based on race, and within a year of his advocacy, the three remaining unreconstructed states—Mississippi, Virginia, and Texas—adopted the amendment and were readmitted to Congress.[^44]

Grant's administration passed groundbreaking civil rights legislation and vigorously enforced it. On March 18, 1869, Grant signed into law equal rights for African Americans to serve on juries and hold office in Washington, D.C., and in 1870 he signed the Naturalization Act extending citizenship to foreign-born black people.[^45] When the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups used violence and intimidation to prevent African Americans from voting, Grant supported passage of the Force Acts (1870-1871) that authorized the president to use military force to protect voting rights and permitted suspension of habeas corpus in pursuit of that aim.[^46] In October 1871, Grant instituted martial law in nine counties in South Carolina, using federal troops to arrest Klan members and restore order, the most aggressive federal intervention on behalf of civil rights until the 1960s.[^47]

Grant also created important government institutions and protections. He signed legislation establishing the Department of Justice in 1870, providing the federal government with dedicated legal capacity to enforce civil rights laws and prosecute organizations like the Klan.[^48] In 1871, he created the first Civil Service Commission, advancing professional government administration beyond any prior president's efforts.[^49] Grant established the Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) to provide scientific meteorological services, and signed legislation creating Yellowstone National Park in 1872, America's first national park and the beginning of the conservation movement.[^50] His efforts toward Native American policy, while paternalistic by modern standards, represented an attempt to transition from military conflict to peaceful assimilation, including his "Peace Policy" that sought to replace corrupt Indian agents with religious nominees and eventually extend citizenship to Native Americans.[^51]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his personal honesty, Grant's presidency became synonymous with political corruption through a series of scandals involving his appointees. Grant's fundamental weakness as president was his poor judgment of character and misplaced loyalty to friends and associates, allowing subordinates to exploit their positions while he defended them against mounting evidence of wrongdoing.[^52] The term "Grantism" was coined by Republican Senator Charles Sumner in 1872 to describe the systemic corruption that characterized the administration, and Grant's presidency became arguably the most scandal-ridden in American history until that time.[^53]

The scandals began early with the Black Friday gold panic of September 24, 1869, when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk attempted to corner the gold market with inside information obtained through Grant's brother-in-law, Abel Corbin.[^54] Though Grant himself was not involved and ultimately ordered Treasury gold sales that broke the ring, his initial naïveté and the involvement of his relative damaged his credibility.[^55] The incident established a pattern: Grant's associates would exploit their connections while Grant, trusting in personal loyalty, would refuse to believe evidence of their misconduct.

The Crédit Mobilier scandal, though occurring before Grant's presidency, involved his vice president Schuyler Colfax and damaged the administration when revealed in 1872.[^56] The scheme involved railroad company executives bribing congressmen with stock to avoid investigation of their massive overcharging on federal contracts, ultimately defrauding the government of millions.[^57] While Grant was not implicated, the scandal tainted his administration and contributed to growing public cynicism about Reconstruction-era politics.

The Whiskey Ring scandal of 1875 was perhaps the most damaging to Grant personally. Treasury officials and whiskey distillers conspired to avoid taxes on liquor by bribing tax collectors, defrauding the federal government of over $3 million.[^58] The conspiracy extended to multiple cities and involved officials Grant had personally appointed, with some proceeds going to Republican Party coffers.[^59] Most painfully for Grant, his personal secretary Orville Babcock was implicated, though Grant refused to believe it and provided a deposition defending Babcock's character that helped secure his acquittal.[^60] Grant's loyalty to Babcock, despite overwhelming evidence of guilt, exemplified his inability to hold corrupt subordinates accountable.

The final major scandal came in 1876 when Secretary of War William Belknap was impeached for accepting bribes to award lucrative Indian trading post appointments.[^61] Belknap had received approximately $6,000 annually in bribes for years, but Grant's fondness for Belknap and his recently deceased wife led him to accept Belknap's resignation on the morning of impeachment, allowing Belknap to avoid conviction in the Senate trial.[^62] This incident further reinforced Grant's image as either complicit or incompetent in controlling his administration.

Beyond corruption, Grant faced criticism for his handling of economic policy. The Panic of 1873, triggered by the collapse of Jay Cooke's banking house, plunged the nation into a severe economic depression lasting five years.[^63] Grant's conservative monetary policies, including vetoing an inflation bill that would have increased paper currency circulation, were blamed by many for worsening the depression, though modern economists generally credit him with preventing even worse inflation.[^64] His attention to economic crisis also diverted his focus from Reconstruction, allowing white supremacist "Redeemer" governments to regain power across the South through violence and intimidation.[^65]

Grant's military record also drew criticism. His willingness to accept enormous casualties earned him the nickname "the Butcher," particularly after the Battle of Cold Harbor where Union forces suffered over 7,000 casualties in less than an hour in a frontal assault on entrenched Confederate positions.[^66] Critics argued that Grant simply bludgeoned his way to victory through superior numbers rather than superior generalship, though most military historians now recognize that his strategic vision and operational skill were essential to Union victory.[^67] His memoirs notably express regret for ordering the Cold Harbor assault, calling it his greatest tactical mistake.[^68]

## Personal Life

Ulysses and Julia Grant's marriage was one of deep mutual devotion that sustained him through the trials of war and politics. They met in February 1844 when Grant visited her brother Frederick, his West Point classmate, at the Dent plantation White Haven near St. Louis.[^69] Despite Julia's strabismus (crossed eyes) and Grant's modest prospects, they fell in love, and Grant proposed in May 1844 with his West Point class ring before deploying to the Mexican-American War.[^70] Their four-year engagement endured separation and opposition from Grant's father, who refused to attend their wedding on August 22, 1848, because the Dents were slaveholders.[^71]

Julia Dent Grant came from a slaveholding Missouri family; her father "Colonel" Frederick Dent owned White Haven, an 800-acre plantation worked by approximately 70 enslaved people.[^72] This background created tension with the Grant family's abolitionist views, though Julia herself maintained that slavery was a benevolent institution, a view she apparently never fully abandoned.[^73] Grant's own views on slavery evolved considerably; during his brief attempt at farming at White Haven in the 1850s, he worked a farm using an enslaved man named William Jones, whom Grant freed in 1859 despite being in desperate financial straits when he could have sold him.[^74]

The Grants had four children between 1850 and 1858: Frederick Dent Grant (1850), Ulysses S. Grant Jr., known as "Buck" (1852), Ellen Wrenshall Grant, called "Nellie" (1855), and Jesse Root Grant II (1858).[^75] By all accounts, Grant was a devoted and affectionate father who delighted in his children and maintained close relationships with them throughout his life.[^76] His family provided him emotional stability that contrasted sharply with his struggles in professional life during the 1850s, when he failed at farming, firewood sales, real estate, and various other ventures before taking a clerk position at his father's leather store in Galena, Illinois.[^77]

Grant struggled with alcohol throughout his life, a problem exacerbated by loneliness during military postings that separated him from Julia and the children.[^78] The evidence suggests he was not a habitual drunkard but rather someone whose constitution could not handle alcohol well; small amounts affected him greatly, and drinking bouts during periods of stress and separation from family caused problems during his military career.[^79] Julia's presence seemed to help him control his drinking, and during the Civil War, he largely avoided alcohol problems when she could visit him at headquarters.[^80]

Grant's personality was marked by modesty, quiet determination, and fierce loyalty to friends and family. He was famously taciturn, uncomfortable with public speaking, and preferred action to words.[^81] Unlike many of his contemporaries, he displayed little personal ambition or ego, viewing his military service as duty rather than a path to glory.[^82] This modesty made him an effective military leader who earned soldiers' loyalty through competence rather than charisma, but it ill-suited him for political leadership where recognizing deception and manipulation was essential.[^83]

After leaving the presidency in 1877, the Grants embarked on a two-and-a-half-year world tour, receiving enthusiastic receptions from royalty and commoners alike across Europe, Asia, and Africa.[^84] They eventually settled in New York City to be near their children, where Grant unfortunately lost his savings in 1884 when his son Buck's investment firm collapsed due to his partner Ferdinand Ward's fraud.[^85] Facing bankruptcy and diagnosed with throat cancer, likely caused by his cigar smoking habit, Grant accepted Mark Twain's offer to publish his memoirs, writing furiously against time to provide for his family.[^86] He completed the manuscript just days before his death on July 23, 1885, at Mount McGregor, New York; the Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant became an instant bestseller, earning his family approximately $450,000 and securing his literary legacy.[^87] Julia survived him by seventeen years, dying on December 14, 1902, and was laid to rest beside him in Grant's Tomb in New York City.[^88]

## Legacy

Ulysses S. Grant's legacy has undergone dramatic shifts over the 140 years since his death. When he died in 1885, Grant was mourned as one of the greatest Americans, standing alongside George Washington and Abraham Lincoln in public estimation.[^89] Over 1.5 million people viewed his casket in New York City, and his funeral was one of the largest public events in American history to that time.[^90] His military reputation remained secure; even his enemies acknowledged him as the Union's greatest general whose strategic vision and determination had saved the nation.[^91]

However, Grant's presidential reputation suffered dramatically during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The rise of Lost Cause mythology, promoted by Confederate apologists and given academic credibility by the Dunning School of Reconstruction historians, portrayed Grant's presidency as a failure characterized by corruption, incompetence, and vindictive treatment of the South.[^92] This revisionist narrative, deeply rooted in white supremacist ideology, condemned Grant's efforts to protect African American rights while excusing or ignoring the violence and fraud that ended Reconstruction.[^93] By the mid-20th century, most historians ranked Grant among the worst presidents in American history, with his administration seen as a cautionary tale of good intentions undermined by poor judgment and corruption.[^94]

The late 20th and early 21st centuries brought significant reassessment of Grant's legacy, driven by civil rights movements and more honest scholarship about Reconstruction. Historians began recognizing that Grant fought harder for African American rights than any president between Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson, using federal power aggressively to combat the Ku Klux Klan and enforce voting rights.[^95] His support for the Fifteenth Amendment, establishment of the Justice Department to prosecute civil rights violations, and willingness to deploy troops to protect Black voters represented the high-water mark of federal commitment to racial equality until the 1960s.[^96]

Modern scholarship has also contextualized the corruption scandals, recognizing that while Grant showed poor judgment in appointments and excessive loyalty to subordinates, he was never personally corrupt and the scandals reflected broader systemic issues in Gilded Age politics rather than unique failures of his administration.[^97] Historians have noted that Grant's attempts at civil service reform, though incomplete, represented important first steps toward professional government administration.[^98] His creation of the Justice Department, establishment of Yellowstone National Park, and efforts toward Native American policy reform demonstrate achievements that were overshadowed by scandals but nonetheless had lasting positive impacts.[^99]

Grant's Personal Memoirs, completed just before his death, secured his literary legacy. Mark Twain, who published them, called them "the most remarkable work of its kind since the Commentaries of Julius Caesar."[^100] The memoirs' clear prose, strategic insights, and honest self-assessment have kept them continuously in print, providing each generation with Grant's own account of the Civil War and establishing him as one of America's finest military memoirists.[^101] The book's financial success, earning his widow Julia approximately $450,000, also demonstrated the public's continued affection for Grant personally, even as his presidency fell into disrepute.[^102]

Recent presidential rankings reflect Grant's rehabilitation. While mid-20th century polls consistently placed him in the bottom ten presidents, 21st-century surveys have moved him into the middle or upper-middle tier, with some placing him as high as the top quarter.[^103] This shift reflects not only changing historical interpretations but also evolving values; Grant's commitment to civil rights, once dismissed as misguided or self-serving, is now recognized as morally courageous and tragically abandoned by his successors.[^104]

Grant's military legacy has remained consistently high. Military historians and commanders from William T. Sherman to Dwight Eisenhower to modern scholars have recognized Grant as one of history's great generals whose understanding of modern warfare's political and strategic dimensions was unmatched among Civil War commanders.[^105] His development of coordinated operations across multiple theaters, his recognition that enemy armies rather than territory were the proper objective, and his ability to maintain operational tempo despite setbacks established principles that would be validated in subsequent conflicts.[^106]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has increasingly emphasized Grant's achievements and moral courage, particularly regarding civil rights. Historian Eric Foner argues that Grant "was the most important advocate of African American rights in the late nineteenth century," using federal power more aggressively to combat white supremacist violence than any president until the modern civil rights era.[^107] Ron Chernow, Grant's most prominent recent biographer, portrays him as a fundamentally decent man whose commitment to racial equality was ahead of his time and whose presidency's failures reflected the impossible position of attempting Reconstruction while Northern public opinion abandoned the cause.[^108]

Military historians consistently praise Grant's generalship. Historian Jean Edward Smith writes that Grant "was the greatest general of the Civil War and one of the most brilliant in American history," whose strategic vision transformed how wars are fought.[^109] Brooks Simpson emphasizes Grant's ability to learn from mistakes and adapt to circumstances, noting that his campaigns showed increasing sophistication and that his magnanimity at Appomattox set the tone for peaceful reunification.[^110] Military scholar J.F.C. Fuller placed Grant among history's great captains, arguing that his understanding of modern war's totality made him a more significant military innovator than Lee.[^111]

Defenders of Grant's presidency point to his civil rights accomplishments and pioneering efforts at government reform. Historian Josiah Bunting III notes that Grant's establishment of the Civil Service Commission and support for merit-based appointments laid groundwork for Progressive Era reforms.[^112] Charles Calhoun argues that Grant's economic policies, while politically unpopular, were sound, noting that his veto of inflation currency and support for hard money prevented the economic instability that would have resulted from abandoning the gold standard.[^113]

Recent scholarship emphasizes that Grant's reputation suffered from Lost Cause mythology and racism. Historian Joan Waugh demonstrates how white supremacist historians deliberately distorted Grant's record to discredit Reconstruction and justify segregation.[^114] The National Park Service notes that "Grant's efforts to protect Black Americans and advance their rights were undermined not by personal failures but by the nation's abandonment of Reconstruction's goals."[^115] This perspective suggests Grant's presidency should be judged not primarily by the scandals that plagued it but by his attempt to fulfill the Civil War's promise of equality against overwhelming political and cultural opposition.[^116]

### Negative Views

Critics maintain that Grant's presidency was genuinely disastrous, marked by corruption, incompetence, and failed leadership. Historian William McFeely, while sympathetic to Grant personally, argues that "as president, Grant was a failure" whose poor judgment enabled systematic corruption and whose political naïveté allowed his administration to be captured by self-serving interests.[^117] The scandals were not merely typical of the Gilded Age but reflected Grant's specific failures to supervise subordinates, investigate allegations, or hold wrongdoers accountable.[^118]

Some historians argue that Grant's civil rights efforts, while well-intentioned, were ultimately ineffective and possibly counterproductive. His use of military force to suppress the Klan generated Northern backlash that weakened support for Reconstruction, while his eventual abandonment of aggressive intervention allowed white supremacists to seize power across the South.[^119] Critics note that by his second term, Grant had largely given up on Reconstruction, accepting the triumph of "Redeemer" governments that imposed segregation and disenfranchisement.[^120] The result was that African Americans' situation in 1877 was arguably worse than in 1869, with formal rights legally protected but practically unenforceable.[^121]

Military critics, while fewer, argue that Grant was simply a bludgeoner who won through superior resources rather than superior generalship. Some scholars emphasize his staggering casualty rates, noting that his Overland Campaign cost 55,000 Union casualties in six weeks, leading to calls for his removal even as he approached victory.[^122] British military historian Russell Weigley suggests that Grant's approach to warfare was "crude and wasteful," lacking the elegance and efficiency that marks truly great commanders.[^123]

Critics also argue that Grant's much-praised memoirs, while well-written, are fundamentally self-serving, minimizing his failures and exaggerating his strategic vision.[^124] His account of the Civil War largely omits the role of African Americans as soldiers and agents of their own liberation, focusing instead on white commanders and conventional military operations.[^125] This omission, critics argue, reflects the same racial paternalism that limited his effectiveness as president, viewing Black rights as something to be protected by whites rather than secured by African Americans themselves.[^126]

Some historians question the recent rehabilitation of Grant's reputation, arguing it reflects contemporary political agendas rather than objective historical assessment. They note that while Grant's civil rights efforts were superior to his successors, they were still rooted in paternalism and failed to achieve lasting change, and that highlighting these efforts while minimizing the corruption scandals creates a distorted picture.[^127] The administration's failures were real and consequential, establishing patterns of executive branch corruption and demonstrating the dangers of presidential naïveté that remain cautionary lessons.[^128]
