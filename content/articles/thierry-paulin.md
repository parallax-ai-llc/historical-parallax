## Summary
Thierry Paulin, known as 'The Monster of Montmartre,' was a French serial killer from Martinique who murdered at least 21 elderly women in Paris between 1984 and 1987. He targeted women living alone, robbing and beating them to death. He died of AIDS in prison before trial in 1989.

## Early Life
Born November 28, 1963, in Fort-de-France, Martinique. He was raised by his grandmother and moved to Paris as a young man. He served in the military, then lived in Montmartre. He was openly gay and worked in nightclubs. He developed a drug habit requiring money to sustain. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Between 1984 and 1987, Paulin targeted elderly women living alone in Paris, focusing on the 18th and 19th arrondissements. He would gain entry to their apartments, beat and torture them to obtain money, and leave them to die. His accomplice Jean-Thierry Mathurin participated in many attacks. His victims ranged from age 70 to 95. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
