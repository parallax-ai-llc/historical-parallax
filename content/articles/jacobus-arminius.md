## Summary

Jacobus Arminius was a Dutch Reformed theologian whose views on predestination and free will challenged Calvinist orthodoxy. He argued that God's sovereignty was compatible with human free choice, rejecting unconditional predestination. His followers, the Remonstrants, were condemned at the Synod of Dort in 1618-19. Arminianism later profoundly influenced Methodism and much of evangelical Christianity.
