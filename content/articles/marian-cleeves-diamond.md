## Summary

Marian Diamond was an American neuroscientist who was the first to demonstrate that the brain can change with experience (neuroplasticity). She studied Einstein's brain and found it had more glial cells than average. Her enriched environment studies proved the brain grows and changes throughout life, overturning the dogma that the brain is fixed after development.
