## Summary

Taejong (born June 13, 1367; died May 30, 1422) was the 3rd King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1400 to 1418.[^1] Born as **Yi Bang-won**, he was the fifth son of the founder, King Taejo. He is the "Architect of the Joseon State," famous for his ruthless determination to build a powerful centralized monarchy. He assassinated political rivals (like **Jeong Do-jeon**), seized power through the **Strife of Princes**, and abolished private armies. Although his path was bloody, his administrative reforms laid the stable foundation for the golden age of his son, **Sejong the Great**.[^2]

## The Ruthless Revolutionary (Yi Bang-won)

Before becoming King, Yi Bang-won was instrumental in helping his father overthrow the Goryeo Dynasty.
*   **Poeun Assassination:** He famously ordered the assassination of **Jeong Mong-ju**, the last great defender of Goryeo, clearing the path for the new dynasty.
*   **Strife of Princes:** When his father chose his youngest half-brother as Crown Prince, Yi Bang-won launched a coup (1st Strife of Princes) in 1398, killing the Crown Prince and the prime minister Jeong Do-jeon. He later defeated his own brother Yi Bang-gan (2nd Strife of Princes) to effectively secure the throne.[^3]

## Strengthening Royal Power

Taejong believed in an absolute monarchy, opposing the scholar-bureaucrat-led government envisioned by Jeong Do-jeon.
*   **Abolishing Private Armies:** He outlawed private armies maintained by princes and nobles, integrating them into the national military. This prevented future rebellions.
*   **Six Ministries System:** He reformed the government so that the Six Ministries reported directly to the King, bypassing the State Council, thus centralizing power.[^4]
*   **Hopae System:** He introduced the *Hopae* (identification tags), an early census system to control the population and tax revenue.[^5]

## The Father of Sejong

Taejong abdicated in 1418 to his third son, Sejong, but remained the "King Emeritus" (Sangwang), handling military affairs and clearing obstacles for his son.
*   **Purging In-laws:** To prevent maternal relatives from meddling in politics (as happened in Goryeo), he ruthlessly executed the brothers of his own wife (Queen Wongyeong) and the father-in-law of Sejong (Sim On). This cold-blooded pruning ensured Sejong's reign would be peaceful and free from factional threats.[^6]
