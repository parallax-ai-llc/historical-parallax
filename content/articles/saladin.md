## Summary

Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (1137-1193), known in the West as Saladin, was a Kurdish Muslim leader who founded the Ayyubid dynasty and united Egypt, Syria, and other territories. He is most famous for recapturing Jerusalem from the Crusaders in 1187 after the decisive Battle of Hattin, ending 88 years of Christian rule over the holy city. Unlike the First Crusade's bloody conquest, Saladin's capture was largely bloodless, earning him a reputation for chivalry that impressed even his enemies. His rivalry with Richard the Lionheart during the Third Crusade became legendary. To Muslims, he remains a hero of jihad; to the West, an ideal of noble enemy.
