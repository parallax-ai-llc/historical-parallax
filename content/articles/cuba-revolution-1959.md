## Summary

On New Year's Day 1959, dictator Fulgencio Batista fled Cuba in the middle of the night. Within hours, triumphant guerrillas in olive fatigues were rolling into Havana, greeted by cheering crowds. Their leader, Fidel Castro—a young lawyer turned revolutionary—would not arrive in the capital for another week, savoring a victory march across the island. When he finally reached Havana on January 8, 1959, a white dove landed on his shoulder during his speech. Even nature, it seemed, blessed the revolution.[^1]

The Cuban Revolution transformed a Caribbean island into a Cold War flashpoint. What began as a nationalist movement against a corrupt dictator became a communist state 90 miles from Florida. Castro's guerrilla campaign—launched by just 82 men who arrived on a leaking yacht—proved that determined revolutionaries could defeat a conventional army. The images of bearded rebels descending from the Sierra Maestra mountains inspired revolutionary movements across Latin America and beyond.[^2]

The revolution promised land reform, literacy, healthcare, and dignity. It delivered those things—along with political repression, one-party rule, and an economy that would struggle for decades under US embargo and socialist mismanagement. Whether the Cuban Revolution was liberation or tragedy depends on who tells the story. But its impact on the 20th century—from the Bay of Pigs to the Missile Crisis—is beyond dispute.[^3]
