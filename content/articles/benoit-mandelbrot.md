## Summary

Benoit Mandelbrot was a Polish-born French-American mathematician who developed fractal geometry and discovered the Mandelbrot set. He showed that fractals appear in nature from coastlines to blood vessels, introducing a new way to understand complex shapes and patterns. His book 'The Fractal Geometry of Nature' transformed how scientists and artists think about complexity.
