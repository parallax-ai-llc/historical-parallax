## Summary

Madhvacharya was a Hindu philosopher and theologian who founded the Dvaita (dualism) school of Vedanta. He argued that God (Vishnu/Narayana), individual souls, and the material world are eternally distinct realities. He sharply critiqued Shankara's Advaita, arguing that difference is the fundamental nature of reality. His philosophical system provided the theological basis for the Haridasa devotional movement.
