## Summary

Fukuzawa Yukichi (1835-1901) was one of the most influential intellectuals and educators in Meiji Japan, widely recognized as the founder of modern Japanese civilization. As an author, translator, journalist, and founder of Keio University, he played a pivotal role in introducing Western ideas and institutions to Japan during its rapid modernization period. His writings, particularly "An Encouragement of Learning" (Gakumon no Susume), advocated for education, individual independence, and practical learning as foundations for national strength. Though celebrated as a champion of enlightenment and progress, his legacy has become increasingly controversial due to his advocacy for Japanese imperialism and his views on Asian neighbors, particularly Korea and China.

## Early Life and Background

Fukuzawa Yukichi was born on January 10, 1835, in Osaka, Japan, into a lower-ranking samurai family from the Nakatsu domain (present-day Oita Prefecture). His father, Fukuzawa Hyakusuke, was a low-ranking samurai who served as a treasury official and had a passion for learning, maintaining a personal library despite the family's modest means.[^1] Tragically, Fukuzawa's father died when he was only one and a half years old, leaving the family in difficult financial circumstances. His mother, O-Jun, raised five children alone, instilling in young Fukuzawa a sense of resilience and determination.[^2]

Growing up in the rigid Tokugawa class system, Fukuzawa experienced firsthand the limitations imposed by hereditary social status. Despite his father's learning and abilities, the family could never advance beyond their low samurai rank, a frustration that would profoundly influence Fukuzawa's later advocacy for merit-based society.[^3] His early education began at age five when he started studying classical Chinese texts, which formed the foundation of traditional samurai education. At age fourteen, he moved to Nagasaki to study Dutch, which was then the primary window to Western learning in isolated Japan.[^4]

In 1854, at age nineteen, Fukuzawa moved to Osaka to study at the Tekijuku, a school run by the renowned Dutch scholar Ogata Koan. Here he immersed himself in Dutch studies (Rangaku), learning about Western science, medicine, and culture through Dutch books.[^5] This period proved transformative, as Fukuzawa not only mastered the Dutch language but also developed a systematic approach to learning that emphasized practical knowledge over rote memorization of Confucian classics. His time at Tekijuku also exposed him to the ideas of freedom, equality, and scientific rationalism that would shape his entire intellectual career.[^6]

The turning point came in 1858 when Fukuzawa visited Yokohama and discovered that English, not Dutch, had become the dominant language of international commerce and diplomacy. This realization prompted him to immediately begin studying English at age twenty-three, demonstrating the pragmatic flexibility that characterized his approach to learning.[^7] In 1858, he was summoned to Edo (Tokyo) to teach Dutch studies at a school that would eventually become part of his greatest achievement, Keio University.[^8]

## Rise to Prominence

Fukuzawa's rise to national prominence began with his participation in three official missions abroad during the final years of the Tokugawa shogunate. In 1860, he joined the first Japanese embassy to the United States as a member of the Kanrin Maru mission, becoming one of the first Japanese to visit America in the modern era.[^9] During this visit, he observed American society, institutions, and technology with keen analytical eyes, purchasing numerous books on Western civilization that would form the basis of his later writings.[^10] He was particularly struck by the concepts of individual liberty, democratic institutions, and the practical application of science in everyday life.

In 1862, Fukuzawa traveled to Europe as part of the Takenouchi mission, visiting France, England, Holland, Prussia, Russia, and Portugal. This European tour expanded his understanding of Western civilization beyond the American model, exposing him to different political systems and social structures.[^11] He observed parliamentary debates in England, examined European educational institutions, and studied the relationship between technological advancement and national power. These experiences convinced him that Japan's survival in the modern world required wholesale adoption of Western knowledge and institutions.[^12]

His third and final overseas journey came in 1867, again to the United States, where he acquired more books and deepened his understanding of Western political economy and social organization.[^13] Upon returning to Japan, Fukuzawa found himself uniquely positioned as one of the nation's foremost experts on Western civilization at precisely the moment when Japan was undergoing revolutionary change. The Meiji Restoration of 1868 overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate and initiated Japan's rapid modernization, creating enormous demand for the knowledge Fukuzawa possessed.[^14]

Rather than seeking government office—a path many of his contemporaries chose—Fukuzawa decided to remain independent and devote himself to education and writing. This decision proved strategically brilliant, as it allowed him to maintain intellectual freedom while still exerting enormous influence on policy debates.[^15] In 1868, he changed the name of his school to Keio Gijuku (Keio University), which would become Japan's first modern private university and a training ground for the nation's business and political elite.[^16]

Fukuzawa's writings brought him national fame and influence far beyond the classroom. Between 1872 and 1876, he published seventeen volumes of "An Encouragement of Learning" (Gakumon no Susume), which sold an estimated 3.4 million copies—an extraordinary number in a nation of roughly 35 million people.[^17] These essays argued that education and practical knowledge, rather than birth or hereditary status, should determine a person's position in society. His famous opening line, "Heaven does not create one person above or below another," became a rallying cry for social reform and individual empowerment.[^18]

## Major Achievements

Fukuzawa Yukichi's contributions to Japanese modernization were multifaceted and profound, spanning education, journalism, translation, and social philosophy. His most enduring achievement was the founding and development of Keio University, which began as a small Dutch studies school in 1858 and grew into one of Japan's premier institutions of higher learning.[^19] Keio pioneered Western-style education in Japan, introducing systematic instruction in economics, political science, natural sciences, and foreign languages. The university produced generations of leaders in business, government, journalism, and academia who shaped modern Japan.[^20]

As an author and translator, Fukuzawa produced an enormous body of work that introduced Western ideas to Japanese audiences. He wrote over one hundred books and countless articles, making complex Western concepts accessible to ordinary Japanese readers.[^21] His "Conditions in the West" (Seiyō Jijō), published in 1866-1870, provided comprehensive descriptions of Western institutions, technology, and customs, becoming an essential reference for Japanese reformers.[^22] He translated and adapted works on economics, political theory, international law, and natural science, effectively creating much of the modern Japanese vocabulary for these fields.[^23]

"An Encouragement of Learning" remains his most influential work, articulating a philosophy of education and social organization that challenged traditional Confucian hierarchies. Fukuzawa argued that individuals should pursue practical learning (jitsugaku) that would make them self-reliant and contribute to national strength, rather than merely memorizing classical texts.[^24] He emphasized mathematics, science, geography, economics, and foreign languages as essential subjects for modern citizens. His concept of "independence and self-respect" (dokuritsu jison) promoted individual autonomy while linking personal development to national prosperity.[^25]

In 1882, Fukuzawa founded the Jiji Shinpō, one of Japan's first modern newspapers, which became a leading voice for political and social reform. Through this publication, he advocated for constitutional government, women's education, and economic development while critiquing what he saw as outdated customs and inefficient government policies.[^26] The newspaper gave him a powerful platform to shape public opinion on critical issues facing Meiji Japan, from treaty revision to educational policy.[^27]

Fukuzawa's advocacy for women's education represented progressive thinking for his era. He argued that educating women was essential for national development, as educated mothers would raise better citizens and contribute to family prosperity.[^28] In 1874, he opened a public speaking hall where women could attend lectures, a radical innovation in a society where women were largely excluded from public intellectual life. He wrote extensively about the need to reform marriage customs, eliminate concubinage, and provide women with greater legal rights.[^29]

His economic thought emphasized commerce and industry as foundations of national wealth and power. Fukuzawa promoted entrepreneurship, criticized the traditional samurai disdain for commercial activity, and encouraged talented individuals to enter business rather than government service.[^30] He translated and adapted Adam Smith's economic theories for Japanese audiences and advocated for private enterprise, property rights, and market mechanisms as engines of prosperity.[^31] Many of Japan's leading industrialists and business organizations trace their intellectual lineage to Fukuzawa's teachings.[^32]

Fukuzawa also contributed to Japan's legal modernization by introducing Western concepts of rights, law, and governance. He translated works on international law, helping Japanese officials understand the legal framework governing relations between nations.[^33] His writings on political economy and constitutional government influenced debates about Japan's political structure during the 1870s and 1880s, though he opposed premature democratization, believing Japan needed time to develop an educated citizenry first.[^34]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his celebrated status as a pioneer of Japanese enlightenment, Fukuzawa's legacy is deeply controversial, particularly regarding his views on imperialism and Asian neighbors. In his later years, Fukuzawa became an increasingly vocal advocate for Japanese expansion and a harsh critic of China and Korea, positions that have generated intense scholarly debate and public controversy.[^35]

His most controversial writing is the 1885 essay "Datsu-A Ron" (Leaving Asia), published in Jiji Shinpō, which argued that Japan should abandon solidarity with other Asian nations and align itself with Western powers. Fukuzawa characterized China and Korea as backward, feudal societies incapable of reform and modernization.[^36] He wrote that Japan should "reject bad friends in Asia" and treat these neighbors with the same contempt that Western nations showed them. This essay is often cited as intellectual justification for Japanese imperialism and aggression against Asian neighbors.[^37]

During the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), Fukuzawa's newspaper enthusiastically supported Japanese military action, and his writings described the conflict as a civilizational struggle between progressive Japan and backward China.[^38] He characterized Chinese civilization as stagnant and oppressive, arguing that Japanese military victory would benefit the Chinese people by freeing them from their feudal government. Critics argue that this rhetoric helped create an ideological framework for later Japanese imperialism and militarism.[^39]

Fukuzawa's views on Korea were similarly dismissive and hostile. He supported Japanese intervention in Korean affairs and characterized Korean society as hopelessly backward and resistant to progress.[^40] When Korea sought Chinese support against Japanese influence, Fukuzawa denounced this as evidence of Korean inability to govern themselves. His writings on Korea have been particularly controversial in Korean-Japanese relations, with some Korean scholars viewing him as an intellectual architect of Japanese colonial domination.[^41]

Scholars debate whether Fukuzawa's imperialism was a betrayal of his earlier liberal principles or a consistent extension of his philosophy. Some argue that his advocacy for civilization and progress logically led to supporting forcible modernization of neighboring countries.[^42] Others contend that his late-career imperialism reflected disappointment with China's and Korea's reform efforts and a pragmatic assessment of international power politics.[^43] Still others suggest his nationalism always coexisted with his liberalism, and that he viewed Japanese national strength as the ultimate goal.[^44]

Beyond imperialism, Fukuzawa's political philosophy contained contradictions and limitations. Despite advocating individual independence, he opposed immediate democratization and universal suffrage, arguing that the Japanese people needed more education before they could participate in self-government.[^45] His support for women's education, while progressive, was largely instrumental—focused on women's roles as mothers and household managers rather than as fully autonomous individuals with equal rights.[^46] He never advocated for women's suffrage or complete legal equality.[^47]

His emphasis on Western civilization sometimes led to uncritical admiration and advocacy for wholesale cultural transformation. Critics argue that he undervalued Japanese and Asian cultural traditions, contributing to a sense of cultural inferiority that complicated Japan's modernization.[^48] His famous statement that Japan should "leave Asia and enter Europe" (Datsu-A Nyū-Ō) suggested a racial hierarchy that privileged Western civilization and denigrated Asian cultures.[^49]

Fukuzawa's relationship with the Meiji government was complex and sometimes contradictory. While he claimed independence from government service, his ideas closely aligned with state policies, and his school received government support.[^50] Some critics argue that his proclaimed independence was more rhetorical than real, and that he functioned as an unofficial ideologist for the Meiji state's modernization and expansion projects.[^51]

## Personal Life

Fukuzawa Yukichi married Okamoto Kin in 1861, following an arranged marriage typical of the era. Despite the conventional arrangement, their marriage was reportedly harmonious and lasted forty years until his death.[^52] The couple had nine children—four sons and five daughters—and Fukuzawa was known as a devoted family man who spent considerable time with his children and took an active role in their education.[^53] His personal life reflected some of the reforms he advocated publicly; he treated his wife with respect unusual for the time and ensured that his daughters received substantial education.[^54]

Contemporary accounts describe Fukuzawa as possessing a strong, charismatic personality with a sharp wit and excellent sense of humor. He was known for his straightforward, sometimes blunt manner of speaking and his impatience with pretension and formality.[^55] Despite his intellectual stature, he maintained a relatively simple lifestyle, avoiding the ostentatious displays of wealth that characterized some Meiji-era elites. He enjoyed sake, good conversation, and the company of students and colleagues who would gather at his home for discussions.[^56]

Fukuzawa was intensely private about certain aspects of his life and rarely discussed personal matters in his writings. However, his autobiography, "The Autobiography of Fukuzawa Yukichi" (Fukuō Jiden), completed in 1899, provides valuable insights into his character and experiences.[^57] The work reveals his pride in having remained independent of government service, his satisfaction with his educational achievements, and his belief that he had contributed significantly to Japan's modernization.[^58]

Health issues plagued Fukuzawa in his later years. He suffered from a stroke in 1898 that significantly limited his activities, though he continued to write and oversee Keio University until near the end of his life.[^59] He died on February 3, 1901, at age sixty-six, from a cerebral hemorrhage. His death was mourned nationally, with thousands attending his funeral and newspapers throughout Japan publishing extensive tributes to his contributions.[^60]

His personal philosophy emphasized self-reliance, pragmatism, and continuous learning. He frequently advised students to think independently, question authority, and pursue practical knowledge that would enable them to navigate the modern world.[^61] Despite advocating Western learning, he maintained certain Japanese cultural practices in his personal life and never converted to Christianity, unlike some other Westernizers of his era.[^62] This balance between Western learning and Japanese identity reflected his broader philosophy of selective modernization.[^63]

## Legacy

Fukuzawa Yukichi's impact on modern Japan is profound and multifaceted, though increasingly contested. His most visible legacy is Keio University, which remains one of Japan's elite private universities and has produced numerous prime ministers, business leaders, and intellectuals.[^64] The university's motto, "Independence and Self-Respect," continues to reflect Fukuzawa's educational philosophy. Beyond Keio, his emphasis on practical education and merit-based advancement influenced the development of Japan's entire modern educational system.[^65]

In the economic sphere, Fukuzawa's advocacy for commerce and entrepreneurship helped legitimize business activity and contributed to the emergence of a modern capitalist economy. Many founders of major Japanese corporations studied his works or attended Keio, and business organizations like the Japan Chamber of Commerce trace their intellectual origins partly to his teachings.[^66] His translations and explanations of Western economic theory provided the conceptual framework for Japan's economic modernization.[^67]

Fukuzawa's portrait appeared on the 10,000 yen note from 1984 to 2024, the highest denomination of Japanese currency, symbolizing his elevated status in Japanese cultural memory.[^68] This honor reflected official recognition of his contributions to modernization and education. However, the decision to replace him on the 2024 redesign with industrialist Shibusawa Eiichi sparked debates about how Japan should remember its modernization era.[^69]

His writings remain widely read in Japan, with "An Encouragement of Learning" and his autobiography considered classics of modern Japanese literature. Numerous scholarly studies, biographies, and popular works continue to examine his life and thought.[^70] Schools, libraries, and institutions throughout Japan bear his name, and statues commemorate him in various locations.[^71]

However, Fukuzawa's legacy has become increasingly controversial, particularly in international contexts. His imperialist writings, especially "Datsu-A Ron," have damaged his reputation in Korea and China, where he is sometimes viewed as an intellectual enabler of Japanese aggression.[^72] Korean scholars have been particularly critical, arguing that his contempt for Korean civilization provided ideological justification for the brutal Japanese colonial occupation of Korea (1910-1945).[^73]

Within Japan, debates about Fukuzawa intensified in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries as scholars reexamined his imperialist writings. Progressive historians have challenged the heroic narrative of Fukuzawa as a pure enlightenment thinker, highlighting the darker aspects of his thought.[^74] Conservative scholars have defended him, arguing that his views must be understood in the context of nineteenth-century imperialism and Social Darwinist thinking prevalent worldwide.[^75]

The controversy over Fukuzawa reflects broader debates in Japan about how to remember the Meiji era—as a period of successful modernization or as the beginning of the imperial expansion that culminated in World War II.[^76] Some argue for a nuanced view that acknowledges both his contributions to domestic modernization and his problematic views on foreign relations.[^77] Others contend that his imperialism so taints his legacy that he should not be celebrated as a national hero.[^78]

His influence on Japanese liberalism is also debated. While he advocated individual independence and criticized feudal hierarchies, his liberalism was always bounded by nationalism and pragmatism.[^79] Some see him as the father of Japanese liberalism, while others argue that his thought contained authoritarian elements that undermined genuine liberal democracy.[^80] His opposition to immediate democratization and emphasis on elite-led modernization arguably contributed to the limitations of Japanese democracy in the pre-war period.[^81]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and scholars who emphasize Fukuzawa's positive contributions view him as an indispensable architect of modern Japan who courageously challenged feudal traditions and introduced transformative ideas. Historian Albert Craig argues that Fukuzawa was "the most influential thinker of the Meiji period," whose writings fundamentally reshaped Japanese understanding of society, education, and national purpose.[^82] Craig emphasizes that Fukuzawa's advocacy for education, individual autonomy, and practical learning helped dismantle the rigid Tokugawa class system and create opportunities for social mobility.[^83]

Defenders point to his remarkable achievements in education, particularly founding Keio University and promoting women's education at a time when such ideas were radical.[^84] They argue that his emphasis on merit over birth helped create a more dynamic, achievement-oriented society essential for modernization. Scholar Carmen Blacker characterizes him as a "revolutionary" whose ideas "struck at the very roots of the traditional social structure."[^85]

Many scholars admire Fukuzawa's commitment to intellectual independence, noting that he refused government positions despite numerous offers, allowing him to maintain critical distance from official policies.[^86] His decision to focus on education rather than direct political power demonstrated wisdom and long-term thinking, as his ideas influenced multiple generations through his writings and students.[^87]

Regarding his controversial imperialist writings, some scholars argue they should be understood in historical context. They note that Social Darwinist ideas about civilizational hierarchies were widespread in the nineteenth century, and that Fukuzawa genuinely believed Japanese expansion would benefit Asian neighbors by introducing modernization.[^88] Historian Kiyooka Eiichi argues that Fukuzawa's harsh criticism of China and Korea stemmed from frustration with their resistance to reform rather than racial prejudice.[^89]

Some defenders contend that focusing on "Datsu-A Ron" distorts Fukuzawa's overall legacy, as his domestic contributions to education, social reform, and economic development far outweigh this controversial essay.[^90] They emphasize his progressive views on women's education, his attacks on feudal privileges, and his advocacy for individual rights as his true legacy.[^91]

Japanese business leaders and educators often praise Fukuzawa as the intellectual founder of Japan's economic success, arguing that his emphasis on entrepreneurship and practical education laid the groundwork for Japan's emergence as an economic power.[^92] Keio University alumni, including numerous corporate executives and politicians, continue to celebrate his vision and contributions to Japanese society.[^93]

### Negative Views

Critics of Fukuzawa, particularly in recent decades, emphasize his role in providing intellectual justification for Japanese imperialism and his dismissive, sometimes racist views of other Asian peoples. Korean scholar Lee Kwang-rin argues that Fukuzawa's writings "provided the ideological foundation for Japanese aggression against Korea" and that his "civilizational discourse" masked colonial ambitions.[^94] Chinese scholars have similarly criticized him as an advocate of Japanese expansion who helped create the ideological climate for later military aggression.[^95]

Historian Richard Rubinger notes that Fukuzawa's later writings reveal "an increasingly strident nationalism and a dismissive attitude toward China and Korea that sits uncomfortably with his earlier liberal principles."[^96] Critics argue that his imperialism was not merely a product of his times but represented a fundamental flaw in his philosophical system, which prioritized Japanese national power over universal human rights.[^97]

Some scholars question whether Fukuzawa's proclaimed independence from government was genuine or largely rhetorical. Political scientist Matsuzawa Hiroaki argues that Fukuzawa "functioned as an unofficial ideologist for the Meiji state" despite his claims of independence, and that his ideas conveniently aligned with government modernization and expansion policies.[^98] Critics point out that Keio University received government support and that many of his students entered government service, suggesting that his independence was more limited than his rhetoric suggested.[^99]

Feminist scholars have criticized Fukuzawa's views on women as limited and instrumentalist. While he advocated women's education, historian Sharon Sievers argues that his support was "fundamentally conservative," aimed at making women better wives and mothers rather than achieving genuine equality.[^100] He never supported women's suffrage or complete legal equality, and his vision of women's roles remained confined to the domestic sphere.[^101]

Progressive Japanese historians have challenged the heroic narrative of Fukuzawa as a pure enlightenment figure. Historian Yasukawa Junosuke contends that Fukuzawa's thought contained "authoritarian elements" and that his opposition to immediate democratization reflected elitist attitudes that limited Japanese democracy's development.[^102] Critics argue that his emphasis on elite-led modernization and his skepticism about popular political participation contributed to the weakness of democratic institutions in pre-war Japan.[^103]

Some scholars criticize Fukuzawa's uncritical admiration of Western civilization and his dismissal of Asian cultural traditions. Cultural critic Sakai Naoki argues that Fukuzawa's "Leaving Asia" mentality created a problematic sense of cultural inferiority and alienation from Asian identity that has complicated Japan's regional relations.[^104] This critique suggests that Fukuzawa's wholesale embrace of Western values contributed to cultural confusion and identity problems in modern Japan.[^105]

Critics also point to contradictions in Fukuzawa's philosophy, noting tensions between his advocacy for individual freedom and his nationalism, between his criticism of hierarchies and his elitism, and between his professed liberalism and his support for authoritarian modernization.[^106] These contradictions, critics argue, reveal fundamental inconsistencies in his thought that limit his value as a political philosopher.[^107]
