## Summary

Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy (1809-1847) was a German composer, pianist, organist, and conductor of the early Romantic period, widely regarded as one of the most talented musicians of the 19th century. Born into a prominent Jewish banking family that converted to Christianity, Mendelssohn achieved extraordinary success during his brief 38-year life, composing masterworks including the "Italian" and "Scottish" symphonies, the Violin Concerto in E minor, and the incidental music to "A Midsummer Night's Dream."[^1] He played a pivotal role in reviving interest in Johann Sebastian Bach's music, particularly through his legendary 1829 performance of the St. Matthew Passion.[^2] Despite his immense popularity during his lifetime, Mendelssohn's reputation suffered posthumously due to antisemitic campaigns in Nazi Germany, though his music has since been fully rehabilitated and remains central to the concert repertoire.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Jakob Ludwig Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy was born on February 3, 1809, in Hamburg, Germany, into one of Europe's most distinguished families.[^4] His grandfather, Moses Mendelssohn, was a renowned philosopher and a leading figure of the Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah), while his father, Abraham Mendelssohn, was a successful banker.[^5] His mother, Lea Salomon, came from a cultivated family and provided her children with extensive education in literature, languages, and the arts.[^6]

The Mendelssohn family fled Hamburg in 1811 to escape the French occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, settling in Berlin where Abraham established a banking house.[^7] In 1816, when Felix was seven years old, the family converted from Judaism to Lutheran Christianity, and the children were baptized with the added surname "Bartholdy" (taken from the name of a property owned by Lea's brother).[^8] This conversion was partly motivated by the desire to facilitate the children's integration into German society, which still harbored significant prejudice against Jews.[^9]

Felix displayed prodigious musical talent from earliest childhood. His mother began his piano instruction, and by age six he was receiving lessons from Marie Bigot in Paris.[^10] Upon returning to Berlin, he studied piano with Ludwig Berger, a former pupil of Muzio Clementi and Field, and composition with Carl Friedrich Zelter, the director of the Berlin Singakademie and a correspondent of Goethe.[^11] Zelter was a strict teacher in the classical tradition who grounded Mendelssohn in the works of Bach, Handel, and Mozart.[^12]

The Mendelssohn household became a center of Berlin's intellectual and artistic life. Abraham and Lea hosted regular Sunday musicales where the young Felix and his equally talented sister Fanny could perform.[^13] These gatherings attracted leading figures of German culture, including the poet Heinrich Heine, the geographer Alexander von Humboldt, and the philosopher G.W.F. Hegel.[^14] At age twelve, Felix met Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in Weimar, beginning a friendship that would profoundly influence his artistic development.[^15] Goethe, then in his seventies, compared the young Mendelssohn favorably to the young Mozart, declaring: "What that little fellow can do with his memory and his talent is quite extraordinary."[^16]

By age thirteen, Mendelssohn had already composed numerous works, including twelve string symphonies, several piano sonatas, and various chamber works.[^17] His early training was not limited to music—he received a comprehensive education in classics, literature, mathematics, and modern languages, becoming fluent in German, French, English, and Italian.[^18] He also demonstrated considerable talent as a visual artist, producing skillful landscape drawings and watercolors throughout his life.[^19]

## Rise to Prominence

Mendelssohn's emergence as a major compositional voice came remarkably early. In 1826, at age seventeen, he composed his Overture to "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Op. 21, a work of such maturity and brilliance that it remains one of his most performed pieces nearly two centuries later.[^20] The overture's gossamer textures, vivid orchestration, and perfect capture of Shakespeare's magical atmosphere announced the arrival of an extraordinary talent.[^21]

The pivotal moment in Mendelssohn's career came on March 11, 1829, when at age twenty he conducted a performance of Bach's St. Matthew Passion at the Berlin Singakademie.[^22] This was the work's first public performance since Bach's death in 1750, nearly a century earlier.[^23] Mendelssohn had to overcome significant resistance from conservative members of the Singakademie, who doubted whether audiences would accept Bach's "outdated" style.[^24] The performance was a sensation, requiring two additional presentations and sparking a Bach revival that swept across Europe.[^25] This achievement established Mendelssohn not merely as a composer but as a cultural force dedicated to preserving and promoting the classical tradition.[^26]

Following this triumph, Mendelssohn embarked on the first of several grand tours that would shape his compositional voice and establish his international reputation. From 1829 to 1831, he traveled throughout England, Scotland, Wales, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and France.[^27] These journeys proved extraordinarily fruitful: his visit to Scotland inspired both the "Scottish" Symphony (No. 3 in A minor) and the Hebrides Overture ("Fingal's Cave"), while his Italian sojourn generated the sunny "Italian" Symphony (No. 4 in A major).[^28]

Mendelssohn found particular success in England, where he was lionized by aristocracy and public alike. He made ten visits to Britain during his lifetime, performing before Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (himself an amateur composer and great admirer of Mendelssohn's music).[^29] His oratorio "Elijah," premiered in Birmingham in 1846, was received with near-religious fervor, establishing Mendelssohn as the heir to Handel in the British musical imagination.[^30]

In 1835, at age twenty-six, Mendelssohn was appointed conductor of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, one of Europe's most prestigious musical institutions.[^31] He transformed the orchestra into the finest ensemble of its day, introducing innovative programming that balanced contemporary works with historical repertoire.[^32] He championed not only Bach but also Handel, Mozart, Beethoven, and contemporary composers including Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz, and Franz Liszt.[^33] His concerts established the modern concept of the symphonic repertoire built around canonical masterworks.[^34]

## Major Achievements

Mendelssohn's compositional output, though cut short by his early death, encompasses masterworks in nearly every genre. His five symphonies include the "Reformation" Symphony (No. 5), the "Italian" Symphony (No. 4), and the "Scottish" Symphony (No. 3), all of which remain concert staples.[^35] The Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 64 (1844), composed for his friend, the virtuoso Ferdinand David, is universally regarded as one of the supreme achievements in the violin repertoire, admired for its lyrical beauty, technical brilliance, and seamless integration of soloist and orchestra.[^36]

His Octet for strings, Op. 20, composed when he was only sixteen, remains the finest work in its genre, combining youthful exuberance with sophisticated contrapuntal technique.[^37] The incidental music to Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," including the famous Wedding March (composed seventeen years after the overture), demonstrates his gift for capturing literary atmosphere in musical terms.[^38] His two piano concertos, particularly the First Concerto in G minor, helped establish the Romantic piano concerto as a vehicle for lyrical expression rather than mere virtuosic display.[^39]

In the realm of chamber music, Mendelssohn produced significant contributions including six string quartets, two string quintets, two piano trios, and various sonatas.[^40] His Songs Without Words for solo piano, published in eight volumes, created a new genre of character piece that influenced generations of Romantic composers.[^41] These miniatures demonstrate his gift for memorable melody and refined pianism.[^42]

Mendelssohn's achievements extended far beyond composition. At Leipzig, he founded the Conservatorium (now the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig) in 1843, one of the first institutions of its kind in Germany.[^43] He assembled an extraordinary faculty including Robert Schumann, Ferdinand David, and Ignaz Moscheles, establishing a pedagogical approach that emphasized both historical knowledge and contemporary practice.[^44] The Leipzig Conservatorium became a model for music education worldwide and trained several generations of distinguished musicians.[^45]

As a conductor, Mendelssohn raised performance standards to unprecedented heights. He was among the first conductors to use a baton systematically and to rehearse with meticulous attention to detail.[^46] His interpretations emphasized clarity, balance, and fidelity to the composer's intentions at a time when conductors often took significant liberties with scores.[^47] He established many practices that remain standard in orchestral performance today.[^48]

His editorial work was equally significant. Beyond reviving Bach's St. Matthew Passion, he edited and published numerous works by Bach, Handel, and other Baroque masters.[^49] While some of his editorial choices reflected 19th-century taste rather than strict authenticity, his efforts ensured these works remained accessible to performers and audiences.[^50] He also used his influence to promote living composers, premiering Schumann's First Symphony and conducting the first Leipzig performances of Berlioz's works despite his private reservations about Berlioz's compositional style.[^51]

Mendelssohn's role in establishing the Neue Zeitschrift für Musik (New Journal of Music) with Robert Schumann in 1834 provided a platform for serious musical criticism and advocacy for worthy composers against what they perceived as shallow popular taste.[^52] Though Mendelssohn's direct involvement was limited, the journal became influential in shaping German musical discourse throughout the 19th century.[^53]

His influence on Jewish musical culture, though complex given his conversion, was nonetheless significant. His rediscovery of Bach influenced Jewish composers seeking to integrate into European classical music tradition, while his oratorios drew on Old Testament subjects, maintaining connection to Jewish heritage even within Christian musical forms.[^54]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his enormous success, Mendelssohn faced significant criticism during and after his lifetime. Richard Wagner, who as a young man benefited from Mendelssohn's support, later turned against him with vicious antisemitism.[^55] In his 1850 essay "Das Judenthum in der Musik" ("Jewishness in Music"), published shortly after Mendelssohn's death, Wagner argued that Jewish composers were incapable of genuine artistic expression and could only imitate, specifically targeting Mendelssohn as his prime example.[^56] Wagner's attack, motivated partly by jealousy of Mendelssohn's greater success, would have devastating consequences for Mendelssohn's posthumous reputation in Germany.[^57]

Some contemporary critics accused Mendelssohn of being too conservative, too beholden to classical forms at a time when Romantic composers were pushing boundaries.[^58] Berlioz, despite their cordial personal relationship, privately complained that Mendelssohn's music lacked passion and daring.[^59] Franz Liszt, though respectful, suggested Mendelssohn's refinement sometimes bordered on the precious and overly polished.[^60]

The so-called "War of the Romantics" in the mid-19th century positioned Mendelssohn (along with Brahms and Schumann) as representative of conservative, "classical" Romanticism against the progressive, more radical approach of Liszt and Wagner.[^61] This artificial division obscured the genuine innovations in Mendelssohn's music, particularly his harmonic language and orchestration.[^62]

Mendelssohn's relationship with his sister Fanny represents a troubling aspect of his life. Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel was an extraordinarily gifted composer and pianist, possibly equal in talent to her brother.[^63] However, Felix discouraged her from pursuing a professional musical career, echoing their father's belief that such public activity was unsuitable for a woman of their social class.[^64] Some of Fanny's compositions were even published under Felix's name.[^65] While Felix's attitude reflected the patriarchal norms of his era, his failure to advocate for his sister's talent represents a significant personal failing.[^66]

The most catastrophic assault on Mendelssohn's reputation came during the Nazi era. Despite his conversion and his family's complete assimilation into Christian German culture, the Nazi regime designated Mendelssohn as a Jewish composer and banned performances of his music.[^67] His statue outside the Leipzig Gewandhaus was torn down in 1936.[^68] The regime's propaganda machine, building on Wagner's earlier antisemitic attacks, portrayed Mendelssohn as emblematic of supposed Jewish cultural corruption.[^69] This systematic suppression meant that several generations of German musicians grew up without knowledge of Mendelssohn's achievements.[^70]

In the post-World War II period, some critics continued to view Mendelssohn as somewhat superficial, a gifted craftsman who lacked the profound depth of Beethoven or the revolutionary spirit of Wagner.[^71] The musicologist Joseph Kerman notoriously dismissed the "Italian" Symphony as "essentially an arty piece, a tourist piece, a piece d'occasion," arguing it lacked the structural rigor and emotional depth of the greatest symphonic works.[^72]

More recently, some scholars have questioned Mendelssohn's editorial approach to earlier music, arguing that his modifications of Bach and Handel reflected 19th-century sensibilities rather than authentic historical practice.[^73] His additions of dynamic markings, tempo indications, and even occasional reorchestrations, while well-intentioned, potentially distorted the composers' original intentions.[^74]

---

## Personal Life

On March 28, 1837, Felix Mendelssohn married Cécile Sophie Charlotte Jeanrenaud, the daughter of a French Reformed Church clergyman in Frankfurt.[^75] By all accounts, the marriage was exceptionally happy, providing Mendelssohn with domestic stability and emotional support.[^76] Cécile was beautiful, cultivated, and though not musical herself, deeply supportive of her husband's work.[^77] The couple had five children: Carl Wolfgang Paul (1838), Marie (1839), Paul (1841), Lili (1845), and Felix (1847).[^78]

Mendelssohn was described by contemporaries as charming, witty, and exceptionally cultivated. The pianist and composer Ignaz Moscheles wrote that Mendelssohn possessed "the most versatile culture, the warmest heart, and the most refined manners."[^79] He was fluent in multiple languages, well-read in classical and contemporary literature, and maintained extensive correspondence with leading intellectual figures of his day.[^80]

His relationship with his family remained central throughout his life. He was particularly close to his sister Fanny, with whom he shared a deep musical and intellectual bond.[^81] They corresponded regularly, discussing compositional techniques, sharing musical ideas, and critiquing each other's work.[^82] Fanny's sudden death from a stroke on May 14, 1847, devastated Felix, who was conducting a rehearsal in Leipzig when he received the news.[^83] He immediately collapsed and suffered what was likely a stroke himself, though he partially recovered.[^84]

Mendelssohn was known for his extraordinary work ethic, often composing, conducting, performing, and administrating simultaneously.[^85] He maintained punishing schedules, traveling constantly between Leipzig, Berlin, and his frequent visits to England.[^86] Friends and family worried about his health, particularly his tendency toward nervous exhaustion and severe headaches.[^87]

Despite his professional success and social prominence, Mendelssohn remained sensitive to antisemitism and acutely aware of his ambiguous position in German society.[^88] While his conversion and cultivation granted him access to the highest circles, he could never entirely escape his Jewish heritage in an era of growing racial antisemitism.[^89] Some scholars suggest this tension contributed to his psychological stress and physical ailments.[^90]

Mendelssohn's personal religious faith appears to have been sincere, though scholars debate the extent to which his Christianity represented genuine conviction versus pragmatic assimilation.[^91] His oratorios "St. Paul" and "Elijah" demonstrate deep engagement with Christian and Old Testament subjects, while his letters reveal serious theological reflection.[^92] He composed numerous works for Lutheran church services and took his role as a Christian artist seriously.[^93]

His hobbies included landscape painting and drawing, at which he was quite skilled. He filled numerous sketchbooks during his travels with accomplished watercolors and pencil drawings of scenic views.[^94] He was also an avid swimmer and walker, seeking outdoor recreation when his schedule permitted.[^95]

## Legacy

Mendelssohn's death on November 4, 1847, at age 38, shocked the musical world. He suffered a series of strokes in the months following his sister Fanny's death, and despite brief periods of improvement, died in Leipzig surrounded by his family.[^96] His funeral was attended by thousands, and memorial concerts were held across Europe.[^97] Robert Schumann wrote: "The master whom we mourn stood in the very zenith of his art and life... An evil day took him from us."[^98]

His immediate musical legacy was enormous. The generation of composers that followed—including Brahms, Bruch, and countless others—built upon foundations Mendelssohn established.[^99] His revival of Bach created the historical consciousness that characterizes classical music performance to this day.[^100] The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra and Conservatorium remained at the forefront of European musical life for decades, directly due to his foundational work.[^101]

The Mendelssohn Scholarship, established in Britain shortly after his death, supported young composers including Arthur Sullivan and John Tavener.[^102] Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who had sung Mendelssohn's music in private performances with the composer at the piano, kept his memory alive in British cultural life.[^103]

However, Mendelssohn's reputation underwent significant fluctuation. In the late 19th century, influenced by Wagner's criticisms and the ascendancy of more overtly "progressive" Romantic aesthetics, some critics began to view Mendelssohn as too restrained, too classical, insufficiently innovative.[^104] The early 20th century saw further decline, with modernist critics dismissing his music as Victorian sentimentality.[^105]

The Nazi persecution represented the nadir of Mendelssohn's posthumous fortune. The systematic suppression of his music in Germany from 1933-1945, combined with Nazi cultural propaganda, inflicted damage that took decades to repair.[^106] Even after World War II, German orchestras and conservatories were slow to rehabilitate Mendelssohn fully, partly due to the loss of performance tradition during the Nazi years.[^107]

The late 20th century witnessed a comprehensive Mendelssohn revival. Scholarly research, particularly the critical edition of his complete works (Leipziger Ausgabe der Werke von Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy), revealed the sophistication and innovation that earlier critics had overlooked.[^108] Analysts demonstrated that his seemingly effortless melodies masked sophisticated harmonic and structural techniques.[^109] His orchestration, once dismissed as merely elegant, proved remarkably innovative, influencing Wagner and Brahms more than previously recognized.[^110]

Today, Mendelssohn occupies a secure position in the repertoire. His Violin Concerto is among the most frequently performed works in the genre.[^111] The "Italian" and "Scottish" symphonies appear regularly on concert programs worldwide.[^112] "Elijah" remains a cornerstone of the choral repertoire.[^113] The Octet, piano trios, and string quartets are chamber music staples.[^114]

Beyond the concert hall, Mendelssohn's Wedding March from "A Midsummer Night's Dream" has become virtually synonymous with weddings in Western culture, performed at countless ceremonies from royal weddings to small-town celebrations.[^115] This ubiquity, while testament to the music's appeal, has perhaps obscured its original dramatic context and musical sophistication.[^116]

Mendelssohn's role in establishing the canon of classical music—the idea that certain historical works deserve permanent places in repertoire—fundamentally shaped how we experience classical music today.[^117] His programming philosophy at the Gewandhaus, balancing historical masterworks with contemporary compositions, remains the standard model for symphony orchestras worldwide.[^118]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has substantially rehabilitated Mendelssohn's reputation, revealing the depth and innovation that earlier critics overlooked. Musicologist R. Larry Todd, author of the definitive Mendelssohn biography, argues that Mendelssohn was "among the most versatile and accomplished musicians of the nineteenth century," whose influence on subsequent musical development has been systematically underestimated.[^119]

Scholars now recognize Mendelssohn's harmonic innovations, particularly his use of chromatic mediant relationships and his sophisticated approach to modulation, as significantly influencing later Romantic composers.[^120] His integration of fugal techniques into Romantic forms demonstrated that classical rigor and Romantic expression were compatible, providing a model that Brahms would follow.[^121]

His orchestration is now understood as highly influential. The fairy-like textures of the "Midsummer Night's Dream" Overture, achieved through unprecedented use of divided strings, lightweight scoring, and delicate woodwind writing, created a sound world that composers from Berlioz to Rimsky-Korsakov would explore.[^122] The Violin Concerto's orchestration, which treats the orchestra as equal partner to the soloist rather than mere accompaniment, established a new paradigm for concerto writing.[^123]

Conductor John Eliot Gardiner has championed Mendelssohn's Bach revival as one of the most significant musical events of the 19th century, arguing that "Mendelssohn's performance of the St. Matthew Passion changed music history, creating the idea that earlier music could speak meaningfully to contemporary audiences."[^124] This historical consciousness fundamentally altered how musicians understood their relationship to the past.[^125]

Feminist scholars have reexamined Mendelssohn's relationship with his sister Fanny with more nuance, noting that while he discouraged her professional ambitions, he also respected her musical judgment, consulted her about his compositions, and grieved her loss profoundly.[^126] Some argue that Felix was caught between genuine admiration for his sister's talent and the oppressive social conventions of his time.[^127]

Jewish scholars have explored Mendelssohn's complex relationship with his heritage, arguing that his music often reflects Jewish musical characteristics and that his conversion should be understood in the context of the extremely limited opportunities available to unconverted Jews in early 19th-century Germany.[^128] Michael Steinberg argues that Mendelssohn's life and work represent "a kind of bridge between Jewish and German culture" that the Nazi regime sought to destroy precisely because it demonstrated the possibility of integration.[^129]

British musical culture has consistently maintained Mendelssohn's reputation at the highest level. The pianist and scholar Charles Rosen wrote that the Violin Concerto represents "one of the most perfect realizations of the concerto form in musical history," combining brilliant virtuosity with profound lyricism.[^130] British critics and audiences never abandoned Mendelssohn during the periods when his reputation suffered on the Continent.[^131]

---

### Negative Views

Despite the modern revival, significant criticisms of Mendelssohn persist. Some scholars argue that his music, however skillfully crafted, ultimately lacks the profundity of the greatest composers.[^132] Critic Harold Schonberg, while acknowledging Mendelssohn's gifts, suggested that "there is an element of the comfortable and even complacent in much of Mendelssohn's music" that prevents it from reaching the highest levels of artistic achievement.[^133]

The charge of facility—that Mendelssohn's music came too easily and thus lacks the depth achieved through struggle—has never entirely disappeared.[^134] Comparing Mendelssohn's seemingly effortless output to Beethoven's tortured sketches, some critics argue that the greatest art requires existential struggle that Mendelssohn, raised in privilege and achieving early success, never experienced.[^135]

Feminist critics continue to criticize Mendelssohn's treatment of Fanny, arguing that his active discouragement of her compositional career represents not merely acceptance of social norms but active enforcement of patriarchal oppression.[^136] Some suggest that Felix's success came partly at Fanny's expense, as he absorbed her ideas and benefited from her critical insights while denying her equivalent recognition.[^137]

Critics of Mendelssohn's religious journey argue that his conversion represented opportunism rather than conviction, an abandonment of Jewish identity to gain social acceptance and professional advancement.[^138] Some Jewish scholars view the conversion as a betrayal, particularly given Moses Mendelssohn's role as a champion of Jewish Enlightenment and integration without assimilation.[^139]

Musicologists specializing in historical performance practice criticize Mendelssohn's editorial interventions in Bach and Handel, arguing that his modifications, while popularizing these works, also distorted them according to 19th-century taste.[^140] His additions of Romantic-style dynamics, his use of larger orchestras than the originals specified, and his occasional rewriting of passages have been characterized as "well-intentioned vandalism" that hindered authentic understanding of Baroque music.[^141]

Some critics argue that Mendelssohn's conservatism, particularly his resistance to the more radical innovations of Berlioz, Liszt, and Wagner, positioned him on the wrong side of musical history.[^142] While his technical mastery is undeniable, these critics suggest he used his considerable talents to perfect existing forms rather than create genuinely new musical languages.[^143]

Political critics have noted Mendelssohn's essentially conservative social and political views, arguing that unlike Beethoven or Wagner, he never used his music to challenge the political status quo.[^144] His comfortable position within the Prussian establishment and his cordial relationships with royalty suggest an artist content with existing hierarchies.[^145]

The assessment of Theodor Adorno, while written before the full Mendelssohn revival, still carries weight in some circles. Adorno argued that Mendelssohn's music exemplifies bourgeois complacency, a surface brilliance that masks an absence of genuine dialectical development or social critique.[^146] While many modern scholars reject this view as ideologically driven and musically inaccurate, it represents a persistent strain of criticism.[^147]
