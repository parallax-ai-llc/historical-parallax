## Summary

Samson Raphael Hirsch was a German rabbi who founded Neo-Orthodoxy (Torah im Derech Eretz), a movement that combined strict observance of Jewish law with engagement in modern Western culture. His commentary on the Torah and his philosophical works, including The Nineteen Letters, articulated a vision of Judaism compatible with modernity while maintaining traditional practice. He served as rabbi of the separatist Orthodox community in Frankfurt am Main.
