## Summary

On April 17, 1975, the Khmer Rouge marched into Phnom Penh. Citizens, exhausted by years of civil war and American bombing, greeted them with relief. The war was over. Peace had come. Within hours, the soldiers began emptying the city—every hospital, every home—at gunpoint. The sick were wheeled out on their beds to die on the roads. Two million people were forced into the countryside. The genocide had begun.[^1]

Over the next three years, eight months, and twenty days, the Khmer Rouge regime—led by Pol Pot and committed to an extreme vision of peasant communism—killed approximately 1.5 to 2 million Cambodians. That was roughly one quarter of the entire population. Victims were executed for wearing glasses (a sign of intellectualism), speaking a foreign language, having soft hands, or simply being from the city. Many more died from starvation, disease, and exhaustion in the fields.[^2]

The Khmer Rouge called it "Year Zero." They were building a new society by destroying everything that came before: education, religion, family, individual identity. The killing fields of Cambodia became synonymous with ideological madness—a warning of what happens when utopian vision meets absolute power. The regime ended not because the world intervened, but because Vietnam invaded and overthrew them. To this day, many perpetrators have never faced justice.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Cambodia Before 1975

**The Kingdom:**

- Ancient Khmer Empire (peak 9th-13th century) built Angkor Wat
- French protectorate 1863-1953
- Independence under King Norodom Sihanouk

**Sihanouk's neutral policy:**

- Tried to keep Cambodia out of Vietnam War
- Allowed North Vietnamese supply routes through Cambodia (Ho Chi Minh Trail)
- Balancing act between superpowers

**1970 Coup:**

- General Lon Nol overthrew Sihanouk while he was abroad
- Cambodia dragged into Vietnam War
- Sihanouk allied with Khmer Rouge from exile[^4]

### The Khmer Rouge

**Origins:**

- Communist guerrillas founded in 1960s
- "Khmer Rouge" (Red Khmers) = French term
- Leadership: educated in France, influenced by Maoism
- Pol Pot (Saloth Sar) emerged as leader

**Ideology:**

- Extreme agrarian communism
- Rejection of all foreign influence (including Vietnamese communism)
- Return to mythic peasant purity
- Cities as corruption; intellectuals as enemies
- Self-sufficiency at any cost

**Growth:**

- 1970: Few thousand fighters
- 1970-1975: Fueled by US bombing and civil war chaos
- By 1975: Controlled countryside; 70,000 soldiers[^5]

### US Bombing

Between 1969 and 1973, the United States conducted massive bombing of Cambodia:

- **2.7 million tons of bombs dropped**—more than all Allied bombs in WWII
- Ostensibly targeting North Vietnamese supply lines
- **30,000-150,000** civilians killed
- Devastated countryside
- Drove survivors into Khmer Rouge arms
- Created the chaos the Khmer Rouge exploited

**The bombing helped create the conditions for genocide.**[^6]

## The Genocide

### Day One: April 17, 1975

**Phnom Penh fell:**

- Khmer Rouge soldiers in black pajamas entered the capital
- Initial celebrations—the war was over
- Within hours, soldiers ordered evacuation

**The evacuation:**

> "You must leave. The Americans are going to bomb the city. It's only for three days."

- 2 million people forced out at gunpoint
- Hospitals emptied; patients pushed in beds
- No transport, no food, no water
- The sick, elderly, and young died on the roads
- Anyone who resisted was shot
- The capital became a ghost city

**This was not military necessity. It was ideology:** Cities were evil; everyone must become peasants.[^7]

### "Year Zero"

**The Khmer Rouge declared a complete restart of civilization:**

**Abolition of:**

- Money (currency destroyed)
- Private property
- Religion (Buddhist monks killed or forced to work)
- Family structure (collective eating, children separated)
- Education (schools closed)
- Markets, hospitals, courts
- Any vestige of the old society

**New Cambodia:**

- "Democratic Kampuchea" (the official name)
- Everything before = tainted, corrupt
- History erased
- Foreign embassies closed (except China, North Korea)
- Total isolation from the world[^8]

### The Labor Camps

**The entire population was forced into agricultural labor:**

**Conditions:**

- 12-16 hour workdays
- Inadequate food (often watery rice gruel)
- No medicine
- Malaria, dysentery, exhaustion
- Families separated
- No rest
- Slogans: "To keep you is no benefit; to destroy you is no loss"

**The goal:** Achieve rice production surpluses to prove the revolution's success

- Impossible quotas set
- Failed harvests blamed on "enemies"
- Starvation widespread

**Estimated deaths from disease, starvation, exhaustion:** 750,000-1,000,000[^9]

### The Executions

**In addition to deaths by labor, the Khmer Rouge systematically executed perceived enemies:**

**Targeted groups:**

- Former government officials and soldiers
- Educated people (teachers, doctors, lawyers)
- Urban residents (called "New People" or "April 17 People")
- Ethnic minorities (Vietnamese, Chinese, Cham Muslims)
- Religious figures (Buddhist monks and nuns)
- Anyone with foreign connections
- Anyone who showed dissent

**How they were identified:**

- **Glasses** = intellectual
- **Soft hands** = not a peasant
- **Speaking French or English** = foreign corruption
- **Knowing how to read** = potential enemy

**Methods:**

- Blunt force (to save bullets)
- Hoes, pickaxes, bamboo poles, machetes
- Suffocation with plastic bags
- Babies swung against trees
- Mass burial in pits (often while still alive)

**Killing fields:** Over 20,000 mass grave sites have been identified[^10]

### Tuol Sleng (S-21)

**The most infamous prison:**

- Former high school converted to torture/execution center
- 1975-1979: 14,000-17,000 people imprisoned
- **Only about 12 survived** (some estimates say 7)
- Run by Kaing Guek Eav ("Duch")
- Detailed records kept: photographs, confessions under torture
- Prisoners "confessed" to working for CIA, KGB, or Vietnamese
- After confession: taken to Choeung Ek (killing fields) and killed

**The photos:** Thousands of haunting mugshots remain—the faces of the dead.[^11]

### Ethnic Cleansing

**Specific groups targeted:**

**Vietnamese:**

- Khmer Rouge ideology was anti-Vietnamese
- Up to 100% of Vietnamese in Cambodia killed
- Estimated 100,000+ killed or expelled

**Chinese:**

- 50% of ethnic Chinese population killed
- Approximately 215,000 dead

**Cham (Muslims):**

- 36-40% killed
- Mosques destroyed
- Forced to eat pork; killed for refusing
- Approximately 100,000 dead

**Thai, Lao, and other minorities:** Similar persecution

**This was ethnic as well as political genocide.**[^12]

| Starvation | 500,000-800,000   |
| Disease    | 200,000-500,000   |
| Exhaustion | Included above    |

## The End

### Vietnamese Invasion

**The regime fell not through internal resistance but foreign intervention:**

**Background:**

- Khmer Rouge attacked Vietnamese border areas
- Killed Vietnamese civilians
- Phnom Penh increasingly hostile to Hanoi
- Despite both being communist, deep enmity

**December 1978:**

- Vietnam launched full invasion with 150,000 troops

**January 7, 1979:**

- Vietnamese forces captured Phnom Penh
- Khmer Rouge fled to Thai border
- The genocide ended—after 3 years, 8 months, 20 days

**Vietnamese occupation continued until 1989.**[^14]

### Aftermath

**International response:**

- China (ally of Khmer Rouge) invaded Vietnam; brief border war
- US and West continued to recognize Khmer Rouge-controlled seat at UN until 1990
- Cold War politics trumped human rights
- Khmer Rouge guerrillas continued fighting until 1999

**Cambodia:**

- Hun Sen (former Khmer Rouge cadre who defected) installed by Vietnam
- Ruled Cambodia until 2023
- Authoritarian stability replaced mass murder
- Reconstruction slow and painful[^15]

---

## Justice

### Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC)

**Established:** 2003 (agreement); trials began 2007

**Mandate:** Try senior Khmer Rouge leaders for crimes

**Proceedings:**
| Case | Defendant | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Case 001 | Duch | Life imprisonment (2012) |
| Case 002 | Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan | Both: Life imprisonment |
| Cases 003-004 | Suspended or dismissed |

**Limitations:**

- Only a handful tried
- Proceedings slow and expensive
- Most perpetrators died free
- Pol Pot never faced trial
- Charges against lower-level cadres not pursued

**By the time of trials, many key figures were dead or dying.**[^16]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Why Did It Happen?

**Multiple factors:**

1. **US bombing:** Destroyed rural Cambodia; radicalized population
2. **Cold War:** Cambodia caught between superpowers
3. **Extreme ideology:** Maoism taken to logical extreme
4. **Isolation:** No external checks on regime
5. **Peasant resentment:** Real grievances exploited
6. **Total power:** No institutions to restrain leadership
7. **Dehumanization:** Enemies were "microbes" to be "swept away"

### Comparison to Other Genocides

| Feature                | Khmer Rouge             | Holocaust          | Rwanda             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Percentage killed      | ~25%                    | ~60% of Jews       | ~75% of Tutsi      |
| Primary weapon         | Starvation, crude tools | Industrial killing | Machetes           |
| Ideology               | Agrarian communism      | Racial purity      | Ethnic nationalism |
| Duration               | 3+ years                | ~4 years           | 100 days           |
| External intervention? | Vietnam ended it        | Allied victory     | Minimal            |

### What Makes It Unique

- **Auto-genocide:** The state killed its own people, not a foreign group
- **Class as race:** Urban origin treated as an ethnic category
- **Totality:** Attempted to rebuild civilization from zero
- **Impunity:** Many perpetrators integrated into society; minimal prosecutions[^17]

## Legacy

### For Cambodia

**Continuing trauma:**

- Average age of survivors now in 60s-70s; memory fading
- Young generation often unaware of details
- Mental health burden
- Missing generation (educated were killed)
- Mass graves still being discovered
- Survivors and perpetrators live side by side

**Memorialization:**

- Choeung Ek (Killing Fields) memorial
- Tuol Sleng Museum
- National Day of Remembrance (May 20)
- Oral history projects[^18]

### For the World

**Lessons:**

- Ideology without constraint can justify anything
- Cold War politics can ignore genocide
- "Never Again" must mean action
- Justice delayed is justice incomplete
- Rebuilding from mass atrocity takes generations

**Legal precedent:**

- ECCC contributed to international criminal law
- Defined crimes against humanity in Cambodian context
- But showed limits of delayed justice[^19]

### Cultural Impact

**"The Killing Fields" (1984):**

- Academy Award-winning film
- Introduced world to Cambodia's horror
- Haing S. Ngor (survivor) won Best Supporting Actor
- He was murdered in LA in 1996

**Documentation:**

- DC-Cam (Documentation Center of Cambodia) preserves evidence
- Victim testimonies recorded
- Educational programs in schools[^20]
