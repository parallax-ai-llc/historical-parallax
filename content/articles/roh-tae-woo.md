## Summary

Roh Tae-woo (born December 4, 1932; died October 26, 2021) was a South Korean politician and former army general who served as the 6th President of South Korea from 1988 to 1993.[^1] A close ally of Chun Doo-hwan, Roh played a key role in the 1979 military coup and the subsequent authoritarian regime. However, in the face of massive pro-democracy protests in 1987, he issued the historic "June 29 Declaration," conceding to demands for direct presidential elections.[^2] As the first directly elected president of the Sixth Republic, his tenure was marked by the diplomatic success of "Nordpolitik," successfully establishing relations with communist bioc nations, and the hosting of the 1988 Seoul Olympics. His legacy is complicated by his later conviction for corruption and his role in the 1979 coup and Gwangju massacre suppression.[^3]

## Early Life and Military Career

Roh Tae-woo was born on December 4, 1932, in Dalseong County, near Daegu, North Gyeongsang Province.[^4] He attended the Korea Military Academy (KMA), graduating in the 11th class in 1955 alongside his lifelong friend and political ally, Chun Doo-hwan.[^5]

Roh served in the Vietnam War as a district commander and rose through the ranks to become a major general. In 1979, as the commander of the 9th Infantry Division, he played a critical role in the **December 12 Military Insurrection**, moving his troops from the frontline to Seoul to support Chun Doo-hwan's seizure of power.[^6] Following the coup, he held key military and government positions, including Commander of the Defense Security Command and Minister of Home Affairs.[^7]

## Rise to Power and June 29 Declaration

In 1987, Chun Doo-hwan designated Roh as his successor, sparking nationwide outrage. The public, tired of military rule, demanded direct elections, leading to the **June Democratic Struggle**.[^8] On June 29, 1987, in a surprising turn of events, Roh issued the **June 29 Declaration**, accepting the opposition's demands for a direct presidential election system, amnesty for Kim Dae-jung, and restoration of civil rights.[^9]

This strategic move allowed him to run as the candidate for the ruling Democratic Justice Party. In the December 1987 election, the opposition vote was split between Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, allowing Roh to win the presidency with 36.6% of the vote.[^10]

## Presidency (1988–1993)

Roh's administration, often transitioning from authoritarianism to democracy, focused heavily on foreign policy and internal stabilization.

### Nordpolitik (Northern Policy)
Roh's most significant achievement was his **Nordpolitik** policy, aimed at engaging with traditional communist allies of North Korea. Capitalizing on the geopolitical shifts at the end of the Cold War, his government established diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union (1990) and the People's Republic of China (1992).[^11] This diplomatic maneuvering isolated North Korea and facilitated the simultaneous admission of both Koreas to the United Nations in 1991.[^12]

### Domestic Policy and Olympics
His presidency oversaw the successful hosting of the **1988 Seoul Olympics**, which showcased South Korea's economic development to the world.[^13] Domestically, he faced challenges from a "ruling minority, opposition majority" National Assembly. To overcome this, he orchestrated a controversial three-party merger in 1990, joining forces with Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil to form the Democratic Liberal Party.[^14]

To address housing shortages, his government undertook a massive construction project to build two million housing units, creating new satellite cities like Bundang and Ilsan.[^15]

## Controversies and Trials

Like his predecessor, Roh faced legal reckoning after leaving office.

### Slush Funds and Corruption
In 1995, allegations surfaced that Roh had amassed hundreds of millions of dollars in secret slush funds from business conglomerates (chaebols) during his presidency.[^16] He publicly admitted to accumulating approximately 500 billion won (about $450 million at the time) and apologized.[^17]

### Trial and Conviction
He was arrested and tried alongside Chun Doo-hwan for corruption, mutiny (for the 12.12 coup), and treason (for the Gwangju crackdown). In August 1996, he was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison (later reduced to 17 years) and ordered to pay massive fines.[^18] He was pardoned in December 1997 by President Kim Young-sam.[^19]

### Later Life and Apology
Unlike Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo largely stayed out of the public eye due to poor health (prostate cancer and cerebellar atrophy). In his later years, his family, particularly his son, visited the Gwangju National Cemetery to apologize to the victims on his behalf.[^20] Upon his death in 2021, his will expressed regret and a request for forgiveness for his "shortcomings and mistakes."[^21]

Roh Tae-woo is viewed as a transitional figure who bridged the gap between military dictatorship and civilian democracy.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

1.  **Diplomatic Breakthroughs:** His Northern Policy is widely regarded as a masterstroke that redefined South Korea's place in the world, opening new markets and diplomatic channels with China and Russia that remain crucial today.[^22]
2.  **Democratic Transition:** While he was part of the military junta, his decision to accept direct elections prevented potential bloodshed in 1987 and allowed for the institutionalization of democratic procedures.[^23]
3.  **Housing Supply:** His push to build two million homes is credited with stabilizing housing prices and modernizing South Korea's urban infrastructure.[^24]

### Negative Views

1.  **Water-Tae-woo (Mul-Tae-woo):** Critics often referred to him as "Mul-Tae-woo" (Water Tae-woo) for his perceived indecisiveness and lack of strong leadership compared to his predecessors.[^25]
2.  **Military Roots:** Despite his democratic election, he is inextricably linked to the 12.12 military coup and the Gwangju massacre. Many view his presidency as merely an extension of the Fifth Republic's military rule under a democratic guise.[^26]
3.  **Corruption:** The massive slush fund scandal revealed the deep-seated collusion between politics and business (chaebol) that characterized his era, tarnishing his claims of a "clean" administration.[^27]
