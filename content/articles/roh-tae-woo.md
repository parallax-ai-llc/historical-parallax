## Summary

Roh Tae-woo (born December 4, 1932; died October 26, 2021) was the 6th President of South Korea, serving from 1988 to 1993.[^1] A key participant in the 1979 military coup alongside his friend Chun Doo-hwan, Roh later pivoted to become the first directly elected president of South Korea's Sixth Republic, marking the transition from military dictatorship to democracy.[^2] His presidency is best remembered for his diplomatic masterstroke, **Nordpolitik**, which established relations with communist bloc nations during the waning days of the Cold War, and for the successful hosting of the **1988 Seoul Olympics**.[^3] Despite these achievements, his legacy is tainted by his role in the Gwangju Massacre and his conviction for amassing a massive illegal slush fund.[^4]

## Early Life and Military Career

Roh Tae-woo was born on December 4, 1932, in Dalseong County, near Daegu. His father, a low-level civil servant, died when Roh was just seven years old.[^5] Despite financial difficulties, he was a diligent student. He entered the Korea Military Academy (KMA) in 1951, where he met Chun Doo-hwan. The two became inseparable friends, a bond that would shape the course of South Korean history.[^6]

Graduating in 1955, Roh rose through the ranks of the military. He fought in the Vietnam War as a battalion commander and later a regimental commander. By 1979, he was the commander of the powerful 9th Infantry Division, stationed on the frontline near the DMZ.[^7]

On December 12, 1979, when Chun Doo-hwan launched a military coup to seize power, Roh played a decisive role. He ordered his 9th Division troops to abandon their frontline positions and march into Seoul to support the coup, an act that would later be judged as mutiny.[^8] Under the subsequent Fifth Republic, he served in key positions, including Commander of the Defense Security Command, Minister of Home Affairs, and President of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee.[^9]

## The June 29 Declaration

In 1987, prolonged pro-democracy protests culminated in the **June Democratic Struggle**. With the 1988 Olympics approaching, the military regime faced a choice between a bloody crackdown or concessions. On June 29, 1987, Roh—then the chairman of the ruling Democratic Justice Party—shocked the nation by issuing the **June 29 Declaration**.[^10] He accepted the opposition's demands for a direct presidential election, amnesty for Kim Dae-jung, and freedom of the press.[^11]

This strategic move effectively split the opposition vote between Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung in the December 1987 election. Roh won the presidency with 36.6% of the vote, becoming the first president of the democratic Sixth Republic.[^12]

## Presidency (1988–1993)

Roh's tenure was an era of transition, balancing the military's lingering influence with growing democratic demands.

### Nordpolitik (Northern Policy)
Roh's most enduring legacy is his foreign policy. Announced on July 7, 1988, **Nordpolitik** aimed to engage with North Korea's communist allies to isolate Pyongyang and reduce tensions.[^13]
*   **Diplomatic Breakthroughs:** He established diplomatic ties with Hungary (1989), Poland (1989), and most notably the **Soviet Union** (September 1990) and the **People's Republic of China** (August 1992).[^14]
*   **UN Membership:** This diplomatic encirclement forced North Korea to abandon its opposition to separate UN memberships. In September 1991, both North and South Korea were simultaneously admitted to the United Nations.[^15]
*   **Inter-Korean Relations:** In 1991, the two Koreas signed the "Basic Agreement" on reconciliation and non-aggression, a landmark document that remains the foundation for inter-Korean relations.[^16]

### Domestic Policy: Housing and Infrastructure
Facing a severe housing shortage and skyrocketing prices in the late 80s, Roh launched the **"Two Million Housing Unit Construction Plan"** in 1988.[^17]
*   **New Cities:** The government developed five major "new towns" around Seoul, including **Bundang** and **Ilsan**. The plan succeeded in stabilizing housing prices for the next decade and modernized South Korea's living standards.[^18]
*   **Infrastructure:** His administration also initiated the construction of the Incheon International Airport and the KTX high-speed rail network, laying the groundwork for South Korea as a logistics hub.[^19]

### The Three-Party Merger
In the 1988 legislative election, the ruling party lost its majority, creating a "Yeoso Yadae" (small ruling party, large opposition) deadlock. To break this, Roh orchestrated a surprise political realignment in 1990. He merged his party with the opposition parties of Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil to form the massive **Democratic Liberal Party**.[^20] This act secured a parliamentary supermajority but was criticized as a betrayal of democracy by liberals.

### 1988 Seoul Olympics
Roh presided over the Seoul Olympics, which were seen as a "coming out party" for South Korea's economic development and newfound democracy. The games were highly successful and are credited with opening South Korea to the world (and the Eastern Bloc).[^21]

## Controversies and Later Life

### The Slush Fund Scandal
In 1995, a former aide revealed that Roh had accumulated a massive **400 billion won** (approx. $500 million) slush fund during his presidency.[^22] Roh tearfully admitted to the charges on national television, stating, "I am ready to accept any judgment, including stoning."[^23] This revelation shattered the image of his administration as a "transitional democracy" and exposed deep-rooted corruption.

### Trial and Imprisonment
Along with Chun Doo-hwan, Roh was arrested and tried for mutiny (12.12 coup), treason (Gwangju massacre), and corruption. In August 1996, he was sentenced to 22.5 years in prison (later reduced to 17 years) and ordered to pay 262.8 billion won in fines.[^24] He was pardoned in December 1997 by President Kim Young-sam.

### Health and Atonement
After his release, Roh lived a quiet life, suffering from prostate cancer and later a rare cerebellar atrophy disorder that left him bedridden for a decade. Unlike Chun Doo-hwan, Roh's family made efforts to atone. His son repeatedly visited the **Gwangju National Cemetery** to apologize on his father's behalf.[^25] Roh eventually paid off his entire fine in 2013, the first former president to do so.[^26]

## Legacy

Roh Tae-woo died on October 26, 2021, at age 88. His death was treated with more respect than Chun's; the government held a five-day state funeral, acknowledging his contribution to diplomacy and peaceful transfer of power, while noting his "historical faults."[^27]

### Historical Assessment

**Positive Views:**
1.  **Diplomatic Visionary:** Nordpolitik is widely regarded as the most successful foreign policy in South Korean history, permanently altering the strategic landscape of Northeast Asia.[^28]
2.  **Housing Stabilization:** The massive supply of 2 million homes effectively solved the acute housing crisis of the late 80s and is studied as a model of forceful state intervention in the housing market.[^29]
3.  **Soft Authoritarianism:** Roh was often mocked as "Mul (Water) Tae-woo" for his lack of charisma, but his softer style allowed for the gradual expansion of civil liberties, press freedom, and local autonomy during a volatile transition period.[^30]

**Negative Views:**
1.  **Original Sin:** He could never escape the fact that he was a co-conspirator in the 12.12 coup and the Gwangju massacre. His presidency is seen by many as merely an extension of military rule.[^31]
2.  **Corrupt Legacy:** The scale of his slush fund revealed that he continued the corrupt practices of the past, collecting astronomical bribes from chaebols in exchange for government contracts.[^32]
3.  **Political Distortion:** The 3-party merger artificially created a conservative hegemony that distorted South Korean politics for decades, marginalizing progressive voices.[^33]
