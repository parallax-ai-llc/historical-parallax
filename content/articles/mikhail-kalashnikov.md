## Summary

Mikhail Kalashnikov designed the AK-47 assault rifle, the most widely used firearm in history. Although not a traditional entrepreneur, his invention became the basis of a massive global arms industry. Over 100 million AK-47s and variants have been produced. He lived modestly despite the global proliferation of his design and expressed regret near the end of his life about the weapon's use in conflicts worldwide.
