## Summary

Pavel Florensky was a Russian Orthodox priest, theologian, philosopher, and mathematician often called the 'Russian Leonardo da Vinci' for his polymathic genius. His major work The Pillar and Ground of the Truth explored the foundations of religious knowledge through philosophy, mathematics, and art. He refused to leave Russia after the Revolution and was eventually arrested and executed in the Gulag. His work has been rediscovered as one of the most original contributions to Russian religious thought.
