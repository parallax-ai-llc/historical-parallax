## Summary

Silouan the Athonite was a Russian monk on Mount Athos who is one of the most important Orthodox saints of the modern era. He experienced a vision of Christ and received the teaching 'Keep thy mind in hell, and despair not.' His profound spiritual writings, recorded by his disciple Sophrony, articulate a theology of humble love and self-emptying prayer. He was canonized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1987.
