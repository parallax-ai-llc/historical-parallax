## Summary

Hugo de Vries was a Dutch botanist and geneticist who was one of the first to rediscover Mendel's laws of heredity in 1900. He developed the mutation theory of evolution, proposing that new species arise through sudden large mutations rather than gradual selection. His work on evening primroses influenced early genetics. De Vries coined the term 'mutation' in its modern biological sense.
