## Summary

Ramananda was a North Indian Vaishnava saint who is credited with bringing the Bhakti movement from South India to the north. He taught in Hindi rather than Sanskrit, making devotion accessible to common people. His disciples included both men and women, Hindus and Muslims, and people of all castes, including Kabir, Ravidas, and Pipa. He is considered the link between the South Indian Bhakti tradition and the later North Indian movement.
