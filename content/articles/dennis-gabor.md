## Summary

Dennis Gabor was a Hungarian-British physicist who won the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of holography. He invented the holographic method in 1947 while trying to improve electron microscopy, but practical holography only became possible after the invention of the laser in 1960. Holography has since found applications in art, data storage, security, and scientific imaging.
