## Summary

Lene Hau achieved the remarkable feat of slowing light to 17 meters per second (38 mph) using a Bose-Einstein condensate in 1999, and later stopped light entirely and converted it to matter. Her experiments on 'slow light' opened new possibilities for quantum computing, optical data storage, and quantum communication.
