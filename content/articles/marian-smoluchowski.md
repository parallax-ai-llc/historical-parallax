## Summary

Marian Smoluchowski was a Polish physicist who made major contributions to statistical physics, particularly the theory of Brownian motion and diffusion. He independently developed the theory of Brownian motion around the same time as Einstein. His work on coagulation kinetics (Smoluchowski equation) is widely used in colloid science and atmospheric physics.
