## Summary
Luis Alfredo Garavito, 'La Bestia' (The Beast), confessed to the rape, torture, and murder of 147 children in Colombia, though the actual number may exceed 300. One of the world's most prolific serial killers, he targeted poor and homeless boys aged 6-16. His inadequate sentence under Colombian law sparked outrage.

## Early Life

## Criminal Career
From 1992 to 1999, Garavito traveled Colombia targeting poor and homeless boys. He lured them with money, sweets, or work, took them to remote areas, and tortured, raped, and murdered them. He often decapitated and dismembered victims. He used numerous aliases and disguises. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Arrested April 22, 1999, in Villavicencio after a boy escaped his assault. Police found photos and notebooks detailing his crimes. He confessed to 140 murders and was convicted of 138. His sentence of 1,853 years was capped at 22-40 years under Colombian law. [^3]
