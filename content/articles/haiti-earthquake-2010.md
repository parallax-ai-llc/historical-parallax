## Overview

On January 12, 2010, at 4:53 PM, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck just 16 miles west of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. While 7.0 is severe, in a developed country with building codes (like Japan), the death toll would have been manageable. In Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, it was an apocalypse. Concrete slum housing crumbled instantly. Government buildings, including the Presidential Palace and the UN headquarters, collapsed. The death toll is one of the most contentious in history, ranging from 100,000 to the Haitian government's figure of over 300,000. It highlighted the cruel intersection of poverty, poor infrastructure, and geology.

## The Chaos

**Infrastructure Collapse:**
The port was destroyed (cranes fell into the sea), blocking aid.
The airport tower was damaged (US military had to run air traffic control from a folding table on the grass).
**Hospitals:**
Most hospitals collapsed. Doctors performed amputations in the streets with hacksaws and vodka for sterilization.
**The Bodies:**
There were too many bodies to count or identify. Dump trucks collected them and buried them in mass graves (e.g., Titanyen).

## The Aftermath: A Second Disaster

**Cholera (Oct 2010):**
10 months later, a Cholera epidemic broke out.
Scientific consensus confirmed it was brought to Haiti by **UN Peacekeepers from Nepal** (where Cholera is endemic), whose camp waste leaked into the Artibonite River.
It sickened 800,000 and killed 10,000+. The UN denied responsibility for years before finally acknowledging its role in 2016.

**Failed Aid:**
Billions of dollars were donated globally (Red Cross, etc.).
Years later, investigations showed that much of the money never reached the people, absorbed by overhead, corruption, or foreign contractors. "Build Back Better" became a hollow slogan.
