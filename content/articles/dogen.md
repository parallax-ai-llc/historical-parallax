## Summary

Dōgen Zenji (1200–1253) was a Japanese Zen Buddhist monk, writer, poet, philosopher, and founder of the Sōtō school of Zen in Japan, one of the largest Zen schools both in Japan and internationally today.[^1] Born into aristocracy during the Kamakura period, Dōgen journeyed to China in 1223 where he studied under the Caodong master Tiantong Rujing and experienced profound enlightenment through the practice of zazen (seated meditation).[^2] Upon returning to Japan in 1227, he established a distinctive meditation-focused approach emphasizing shikantaza ("just sitting") and the radical unity of practice and enlightenment.[^3] His masterwork, the Shōbōgenzō (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye), is considered one of the most important philosophical works in Japanese Buddhism and perhaps the finest philosophical work written in the Japanese language.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Dōgen was born on January 19, 1200, in Kyoto during the transformative Kamakura period, a time marking the end of the courtly age and the rise of the samurai warrior class as Japan's new ruling elite.[^5] He came from the highest echelons of Japanese society, with connections to the fading but still powerful Fujiwara regency clan on his mother's side and to the emerging Minamoto samurai clan through his father, who was also a descendant of the imperial family.[^6] His mother was Ishi, daughter of Matsudono Motofusa and sister of the monk Ryōkan Hōgen.[^7] Though probably born into nobility, Dōgen was an illegitimate child of Minamoto Michichika, and his foster father was his older brother Minamoto no Michitomo, who served in the imperial court as a high-ranking ashō (Councillor of State).[^8]

Tragedy struck when Dōgen was only seven years old—his mother died in the winter of 1207.[^9] According to tradition, just before her death, she recommended that he become a monk to help save all beings, a moment that profoundly shaped his spiritual destiny.[^10] This early experience of loss gave young Dōgen a visceral understanding of impermanence (mujō), the Buddhist concept that would become central to his later philosophy.[^11] The orphaned aristocrat received an exceptional education befitting his high status, studying important Buddhist texts from an early age.[^12] Remarkably, by age nine, Dōgen had already read the eight-volume Abhidharma-kośa, an advanced work of Buddhist philosophy that demonstrated his precocious intellectual capabilities.[^13]

In the spring of 1212, when he was thirteen years old, Dōgen made a decisive break with his aristocratic destiny.[^14] He fled from the house of his uncle Matsudono Moroie and went to his other uncle, Ryōkan Hōgen, at the foot of Mount Hiei, headquarters of the Tendai school of Buddhism, the dominant Buddhist tradition in Japan at that time.[^15] There, Dōgen received monastic ordination and began his formal training as a Tendai priest at Enryaku-ji monastery.[^16] However, the young monk soon became troubled by a fundamental doctrinal question that would drive his spiritual quest: if all beings already possess Buddha-nature according to Tendai teachings of "original enlightenment," why is spiritual practice necessary?[^17] Finding no satisfactory answer to this existential paradox at Mount Hiei, and disillusioned by the internal politics and need for social prominence for advancement within the Tendai establishment, Dōgen grew increasingly dissatisfied with the doctrinal debates and political entanglements of the monastic community.[^18]

## Rise to Prominence

In 1217, two years after the death of the pioneering Zen Buddhist master Myōan Eisai (who had introduced Rinzai Zen to Japan), Dōgen went to study at Kennin-ji Temple under Eisai's successor, Myōzen.[^19] This marked Dōgen's first serious encounter with Zen Buddhism, a tradition that emphasized direct experience over doctrinal study. Under Myōzen's guidance, Dōgen began to find answers to the questions that had plagued him on Mount Hiei, yet he still felt the need for deeper understanding that could only be found by going to the source of Zen in China.[^20]

In 1223, at the age of twenty-three, Dōgen and his teacher Myōzen undertook the dangerous passage across the East China Sea to Song dynasty China, the birthplace of Chan (Zen) Buddhism.[^21] This journey was fraught with peril—storms, pirates, and disease made sea travel treacherous—but Dōgen was determined to find authentic dharma transmission. Upon arriving in China, he initially studied at various temples, searching for a master who could guide him to true realization.[^22] His quest led him through several monasteries until, in the summer of 1225, he arrived at Jingde Temple on Tiantong Mountain in Yinzhou District, Ningbo, where he met the sixty-two-year-old abbot Tiantong Rujing (1163–1228).[^23]

Under Rujing's rigorous guidance, Dōgen practiced intensively in the Caodong (Japanese: Sōtō) tradition of Chan Buddhism.[^24] The relationship between master and student proved transformative. According to traditional accounts, during early morning zazen one day, Rujing said to the assembly, "Zazen is body-mind drop off" (shinjin datsuraku), and upon hearing this, Dōgen experienced a profound spiritual awakening—a sudden realization of the unity of practice and enlightenment through the simple act of seated meditation.[^25] Though modern scholars debate the exact details of this enlightenment experience (Dōgen himself never described it in his writings), what is certain is that Rujing recognized Dōgen's realization and granted him dharma transmission, certifying him as a legitimate heir in the Caodong lineage.[^26]

Dōgen returned to Japan in 1227, bringing with him not institutional Buddhism focused on political power or magical rituals, but a pure Zen teaching centered on zazen practice.[^27] Unlike his predecessor Eisai, who had sought to integrate Zen within the existing Tendai framework and actively courted secular authorities, Dōgen aimed for what he considered an ineffable absolute—a pure Zen teaching not tied to beliefs and practices from Tendai or other orthodox schools, and with little concern for guiding people in secular life.[^28] He rejected affiliations with secular authorities and focused instead on establishing authentic meditation practice.[^29]

Initially, Dōgen taught at Kennin-ji, but in 1233 he moved to a temple on the outskirts of Kyoto that belonged to his mother's family, which was renamed Kannondōri Kōshōhōrin-ji (abbreviated as Kōshōji), making it the first Sōtō Zen monastery in Japan.[^30] During this period, Dōgen wrote some of his most important early works, including Fukanzazengi (General Advice on the Principles of Zazen) around 1227, shortly after returning from China, and Bendōwa (On the Endeavor of the Way) in 1231, which asserted the superiority of shikantaza practice through a series of questions and answers.[^31]

## Major Achievements

Dōgen's most significant achievement was establishing the Sōtō school as a major branch of Japanese Zen Buddhism, with a distinctive approach that continues to shape meditation practice worldwide.[^32] His emphasis on shikantaza—"just sitting" or "single-minded sitting"—represented a radical simplification and purification of Zen practice.[^33] The term, coined by his teacher Rujing, referred to zazen performed without focusing on koans, counting breaths, or any other meditation object—simply sitting in a state of full clarity and alertness, perceiving things directly as they are without engaging in discursive thought.[^34] Dōgen stressed that the only thing practitioners need to do is sit, emphasizing quiet awareness of whatever happens rather than striving toward some future enlightenment.[^35]

Central to Dōgen's teaching was the revolutionary concept of the unity of practice and enlightenment (shushō-ittō).[^36] He taught that zazen is not a means to an end, but rather the direct manifestation of Buddha-nature itself: "The zazen I speak of is not learning meditation. It is simply the Dharma gate of repose and bliss, the practice-realization of totally culminated enlightenment. It is the manifestation of ultimate reality."[^37] This meant that enlightenment was not something to be attained in the future through practice, but rather that the very act of sitting zazen was itself the expression of enlightenment. During a single instant of sitting meditation, Dōgen maintained, there arises unity of the mental and physical attributes of the practitioner, as well as a sense of oneness joining the individual with reality.[^38]

Dōgen's literary output was prodigious and philosophically profound. His masterpiece, the Shōbōgenzō (Treasury of the True Dharma Eye), consists of talks and writings collected in ninety-five fascicles covering an extraordinary range of topics including zazen, koans, Buddhist philosophy, monastic practice, the equality of women and men, and sophisticated analyses of language, being, and time.[^39] The work is widely regarded as one of the most important philosophical treatises in Japanese Buddhism and continues to influence Zen practice today.[^40] He also compiled the Shinji Shōbōgenzō, a collection of 301 koans in Chinese without added commentaries.[^41]

Beyond the Shōbōgenzō, Dōgen produced numerous other significant works. The Eihei Kōroku (Extensive Record) contains collections of his formal dharma talks and informal teachings.[^42] The Eihei Shingi was the first Japanese Zen monastic code, establishing the disciplinary framework and daily routines for training monasteries.[^43] He also wrote practical guides including the Tenzo Kyōkun (Instructions to the Chief Cook) in 1237, which elevated even mundane kitchen work to the status of spiritual practice, and the Gakudō Yōjinshū (Advice on Studying the Way), probably written in 1234.[^44] These works demonstrated Dōgen's belief that enlightenment could be found in every aspect of monastic life, not just in formal meditation.

Philosophically, Dōgen made groundbreaking contributions to Buddhist thought. His concept of uji (being-time) presented a radical reconceptualization of temporality and existence.[^45] In his 1240 essay titled "Uji," Dōgen explained that "time itself is being, being itself is time"—time and existence are not separate entities but mutually constitutive.[^46] This meant that things and events do not move through time but rather are time itself in its momentary existence.[^47] Dōgen also made a startling revaluation of the concept of impermanence (mujō), writing: "Impermanence is the Buddhahood… The impermanence of grass, trees, forests is verily the Buddhahood. The impermanence of the person's body and mind is verily the Buddhahood."[^48] Rather than viewing impermanence as suffering to be transcended, Dōgen identified the full realization of impermanence with Buddha-nature itself.[^49]

In 1243, facing increasing tension with the Tendai community on Mount Hiei (who viewed his growing popularity and criticism of established schools as threatening) and growing competition from the Rinzai school, Dōgen accepted the invitation of his patron Hatano Yoshishige to relocate to the remote mountains of Echizen province (modern-day Fukui Prefecture).[^50] In April 1245, Dōgen announced the opening of a new monastery, changing its name from Daibutsu-ji to Eihei-ji (Temple of Eternal Peace), which would become the head temple of the Sōtō school and remains one of the two main training monasteries for Sōtō Zen to this day.[^51] There, far from the political intrigues of Kyoto, Dōgen established an intensive training environment dedicated purely to zazen practice and monastic discipline.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his profound spiritual achievements, Dōgen's career was not without controversy. His uncompromising criticism of other Buddhist schools created significant tensions. He "relentlessly criticized the Buddhists of Hokke [Nichiren], Kegon, and Shingon, calling them 'the scholars who count words and letters,'" and this stubbornness coupled with his rising popularity "did not fail to irritate the traditionally-minded Buddhists, especially those on Mt. Hiei."[^53] He was also highly critical of the Japanese Daruma school of Dainichi Nōnin, viewing their approach as inadequate.[^54] This sectarian antagonism, while reflecting Dōgen's commitment to what he saw as authentic Zen practice, alienated potential allies and contributed to the pressures that eventually drove him from Kyoto to the remote mountains of Echizen.[^55]

Scholarly debate has long centered on the question of "early Dōgen" versus "late Dōgen," with some scholars suggesting significant shifts in his teaching emphasis over time.[^56] Some extol the "early Dōgen" for his inclusive, universal teaching while critiquing the "late Dōgen" for an exclusivist monastic emphasis and increasingly bitter tone.[^57] Others consider only his later phase worthy of attention due to its emphasis on karma and ethics.[^58] Modern scholarship generally views this dichotomy as oversimplified, suggesting that variations in Dōgen's writings reflect different genres and audiences rather than fundamental philosophical changes.[^59] Nevertheless, it remains true that Dōgen's late writings show an ever-growing obsession with monastic discipline that some critics find off-putting.[^60]

The interpretation of Dōgen's texts has itself become controversial. There are very few aspects in Dōgen's work about which there is scholarly consensus, and translations can differ "occasionally to the point of unrecognizability," ensuring that vigorous debate will continue well into the future.[^61] For approximately seven hundred years prior to 1926, Dōgen studies were pursued primarily by sectarian scholars who approached his work with apologetic concerns and confessional hermeneutics—Dōgen was venerated pietistically but never studied critically.[^62] This changed when the philosopher Watsuji Tetsurō published a lengthy essay on Dōgen in 1926, "single-handedly rescuing Dōgen from obscurity" and presenting him as a universal thinker rather than merely a sectarian religious figure.[^63]

Scholars continue to debate fundamental questions about how to read Dōgen. Should he be interpreted primarily as a philosopher or as a religious teacher with pedagogical aims?[^64] Some scholars, such as Steven Heine and Joan Stambaugh, have compared Dōgen's concepts to Western philosophy, particularly Martin Heidegger's "Dasein," but others like Rein Raud argue these comparisons are misguided and that Dōgen's thought operates within fundamentally different frameworks.[^65] The methodological question of whether reading Dōgen as a philosopher is appropriate given his fundamentally religious and pedagogical aims remains unresolved.[^66]

A significant controversy surrounds Dōgen's legacy regarding women and gender equality. Two chapters of his Shōbōgenzō, "Bendōwa" and "Raihaitokuzui," explicitly affirm the equality of women and men in Zen practice, with Dōgen asserting the authenticity of female practitioners and championing ultimate equality between genders in understanding the dharma.[^67] In "Raihaitokuzui," he famously stated: "What is so exceptional about being born male? Space is space; four elements are four elements; five skandhas are five skandhas; the distinction between men and women is also thus."[^68] He spoke admiringly of Chinese nuns like Moshan and Miaoxin who taught male monastics and outsmarted them in Zen dialogues.[^69]

However, the gap between Dōgen's rhetoric and practice has troubled many historians and contemporary practitioners. While "Raihaitokuzui" is considered a masterful treatise on nonduality and gender, it is perplexing that Dōgen did not establish any practice spaces for women or have any direct female dharma heirs.[^70] He did not establish any convents, and though he showed respect to individual nuns like Egi-ni (who spent twenty years by his side), he never ordained any women.[^71] Many historians have argued that Dōgen's rhetoric represented "merely theoretical equality"—that while he paid lip service to the idea of gender equality, he did not take concrete steps to actualize this equality in institutional forms.[^72] This contradiction remains a point of critical discussion in contemporary Zen feminism and scholarship.[^73]

## Personal Life

Compared to the wealth of information about Dōgen's teachings and institutional achievements, relatively little is known about his personal life and intimate relationships. He never married and maintained strict monastic celibacy throughout his life, dedicating himself entirely to the dharma.[^74] The most significant relationship in his life was with his principal disciple and dharma heir, Koun Ejō (1198–1280), who would become the second patriarch of the Japanese Sōtō school.[^75]

Koun Ejō first met Dōgen in 1228 at Kennin-ji, but initially studied under the Daruma school master Kakuan.[^76] After Kakuan's death around 1234, Ejō joined Dōgen's temple in Uji and formally became his student.[^77] The relationship between the two men was characterized by deep mutual respect and dedication. Ejō served as Dōgen's personal attendant (jisha) and devoted himself to preserving and transmitting his master's teachings.[^78] He compiled many of Dōgen's writings, including much of the Shōbōgenzō and volumes 2–4 and the informal meetings in volume 8 of the Eihei Kōroku.[^79] Most significantly, Ejō authored the Shōbōgenzō Zuimonki, a collection of informal talks by Dōgen recorded throughout his discipleship that provides invaluable insight into Dōgen's personality and day-to-day teaching style.[^80]

Beyond Ejō, Dōgen had six other great, influential disciples: Senne, Kyōgō (Senne's disciple), Tettsū Gikai, Gien, Kangan Giin, and Jakuen.[^81] Interestingly, four of these disciples—Koun Ejō, Tettsū Gikai, Gien, and Kangan Giin—had previously been part of the Daruma school before joining Dōgen's assembly, suggesting Dōgen's teaching had particular appeal to monks already familiar with Zen practice.[^82] Dōgen clearly considered Tettsū Gikai a preeminent disciple, though he commented on Gikai's lack of compassion in interactions with other monks, revealing Dōgen's attention to the character development of his students beyond mere intellectual understanding.[^83] Dōgen's early death prevented him from giving dharma transmission to most of these seven disciples, but Koun Ejō later gave transmission to the others, meaning all later successors in Dōgen's lineage officially trace their lineage through Koun Ejō.[^84]

As mentioned earlier, throughout his life Dōgen was influenced by female monastics, particularly a nun named Egi-ni who spent twenty years by his side and to whom he showed the deepest respect.[^85] He also respected many other nuns and frequently cited the examples of accomplished Chinese female Zen masters in his teachings.[^86] These relationships suggest that despite his failure to create institutional structures for female practitioners, Dōgen personally valued the spiritual achievements of women and maintained respectful collegial relationships with accomplished female monastics.

Dōgen's personality, as revealed in his writings and the accounts of his disciples, combined fierce intellectual rigor with deep compassion. He refused to engage in open-ended dispute and required his students to do the same, preferring direct pointing to truth over conceptual debate.[^87] His writing style ranged from the poetically beautiful to the philosophically dense, demonstrating both artistic sensibility and analytical precision. He was demanding of his students, emphasizing rigorous adherence to monastic discipline and meditation practice, yet also capable of profound gentleness, as evidenced by his elevation of mundane activities like cooking to the status of spiritual practice.[^88]

## Legacy

Dōgen's legacy extends far beyond his lifetime, profoundly shaping the development of Japanese Buddhism and influencing Zen practice worldwide. As the founder of the Sōtō school in Japan, his influence cannot be overstated—today, Sōtō Zen is one of the largest Zen schools both in Japan and internationally, with millions of practitioners.[^89] His efforts firmly established the Sōtō tradition as a major branch of Zen Buddhism in Japan, providing an alternative to the koan-focused Rinzai school with its emphasis on pure sitting meditation.[^90]

Dōgen's writings remain one of the most important sources studied in the contemporary Sōtō Zen tradition, with his texts continuously shaping modern Zen practices in Japan and around the world.[^91] Many contemporary Zen practitioners still study his writings intensively, finding in them guidance for authentic practice and profound philosophical insights.[^92] His emphasis on shikantaza and the practice of mindfulness in everyday life has been particularly influential in the development of Zen in the West, where his non-goal-oriented approach to meditation resonates with practitioners seeking authenticity in their spiritual journeys.[^93]

The concept of practice-enlightenment unity, Dōgen's central teaching, continues to be a defining characteristic of Sōtō Zen practice. His assertion that "practice and enlightenment are not two" fundamentally changed how Zen practitioners understand the relationship between spiritual effort and realization.[^94] This teaching has proven especially relevant in contemporary Western Buddhism, where practitioners often struggle with goal-oriented approaches imported from achievement-focused secular culture.[^95]

Philosophically, Dōgen's impact extends beyond religious circles. Since Watsuji Tetsurō and Tanabe Hajime promoted interest in Dōgen as a universal thinker in the twentieth century, the Shōbōgenzō has been lifted from obscurity and is now seen as a distinctively creative masterpiece of premodern religious rhetoric and philosophy.[^96] Modern philosophers have engaged seriously with Dōgen's concepts of being-time, impermanence, and the nature of reality, finding in his work sophisticated phenomenological and ontological insights that speak to contemporary philosophical concerns.[^97]

In recent years, scholarly publication in the field of Dōgen studies has grown dramatically, with many new translations of his writings appearing and diverse interpretive approaches flourishing.[^98] Present-day Dōgen studies encompass multiple factions: the Zennists emphasizing practice, the Genzōnians focusing on close textual reading, the laity movement opening both texts and practice to people in modern society, and the Genzō researchers searching for the authenticity and truth of Dōgen's writings.[^99] Dōgen is recognized as both an important figure in Japanese Buddhist history and, through his interpreters, a major influence in what can be called modern global Buddhism.[^100]

Eiheiji, the monastery Dōgen founded in 1245, remains one of the two head temples of Sōtō Zen (along with Sōji-ji) and continues to serve as an intensive training center where monks undergo rigorous practice in the tradition Dōgen established.[^101] When Dōgen died in 1253, his remains were returned to Eiheiji, where they are still venerated in rites of worship today, making the temple both a living training center and a memorial to its founder.[^102]

Dōgen's exacting approach to sustained meditation, along with strict adherence to the minimalism and diligent discipline of traditional monastic life, has greatly influenced multitudes of zazen practitioners and other contemplatives and spiritual seekers in America and elsewhere.[^103] His masterwork, the Shōbōgenzō, is considered one of the greatest examples of worldwide religious writings, offering deep philosophical insights that continue to challenge and inspire modern practitioners seeking to understand the nature of reality and consciousness.[^104] The ongoing study and application of Dōgen's writings not only preserve his legacy but also inspire a deeper understanding of Zen that transcends cultural boundaries, making it relevant in today's fast-paced world.[^105]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars and practitioners have offered profound appreciation for Dōgen's philosophical and spiritual contributions. The twentieth-century philosopher Watsuji Tetsurō's 1926 essay on Dōgen fundamentally transformed how the Zen master was perceived, rescuing him from sectarian obscurity and presenting him as a world-class philosopher whose insights rival those of the greatest Western thinkers.[^106] Tanabe Hajime and other Kyoto School philosophers similarly promoted Dōgen as a universal thinker whose phenomenological insights into temporality, being, and consciousness offer sophisticated answers to fundamental philosophical questions.[^107]

Religious scholars emphasize Dōgen's uncompromising commitment to authentic practice and his resistance to the corruption of Buddhism by political power and magical thinking. His teaching that zazen itself is enlightenment—not a means to an end but the direct manifestation of Buddha-nature—is celebrated as a profound spiritual innovation that cuts through goal-oriented striving and returns Buddhism to its meditative essence.[^108] As one scholar notes, "Dōgen's Zen is the Zen of practice, and its deepest value is found in its illumination of the unity of practice and enlightenment."[^109]

Dōgen's philosophical sophistication is widely admired. His analyses of being, time, language, and consciousness demonstrate extraordinary intellectual depth and phenomenological precision. Scholar Steven Heine notes that Dōgen "does not have a single, simple or uniform method of koan interpretation, but he varies rhetorical and narrative strategies to bring out particular ideas," demonstrating remarkable philosophical flexibility and creativity.[^110] His concept of being-time (uji) is celebrated as a groundbreaking reconceptualization of temporality that anticipates modern process philosophy and phenomenology.[^111]

Many scholars praise Dōgen's progressive views on gender equality, noting that his explicit affirmation of women's spiritual capacity in "Raihaitokuzui" was radical for thirteenth-century Japan and remains inspiring today.[^112] His assertion that gender distinctions are ultimately empty and that women can achieve the highest levels of enlightenment demonstrated remarkable freedom from the patriarchal prejudices of his time.[^113] Feminist Buddhist scholars appreciate Dōgen's recognition of accomplished female Zen masters and his theoretical commitment to equality, even while critiquing his failure to institutionalize these principles.[^114]

Contemporary practitioners value Dōgen's relevance to modern life. His emphasis that enlightenment can be found in everyday activities—cooking, cleaning, walking—resonates with laypeople seeking to integrate spirituality with daily life.[^115] His non-dualistic approach, which refuses to separate sacred from profane or practice from enlightenment, offers a holistic vision that appeals to contemporary seekers dissatisfied with compartmentalized approaches to spirituality.[^116]

### Negative Views

Despite widespread admiration, Dōgen has also faced significant criticism from scholars and practitioners. His sectarian intolerance and harsh criticism of other Buddhist schools has been viewed as ungenerous and counterproductive. His relentless attacks on Tendai, Shingon, Kegon, and Nichiren Buddhism, calling their adherents "scholars who count words and letters," alienated potential allies and contributed to the tensions that forced his departure from Kyoto.[^117] Critics argue this sectarian narrowness contradicted the universalist implications of his philosophical insights and betrayed an unfortunate dogmatism.[^118]

The debate over "early Dōgen" versus "late Dōgen" reflects substantial criticism of his later writings and teaching emphasis. Some scholars and practitioners find his late work marked by a "bitter tone and ever-growing obsession with discipline" that seems at odds with the liberating spirit of his earlier teachings.[^119] This increasing rigidity and emphasis on strict monastic rules has been criticized as a narrowing of his original vision, privileging institutional concerns over the direct spiritual insight he originally championed.[^120]

Dōgen's failure to establish institutional structures for women practitioners, despite his theoretical affirmation of gender equality, has drawn sharp criticism from feminist scholars and practitioners. Many historians argue his rhetoric of equality was "merely theoretical"—that he paid lip service to gender equality while failing to take concrete steps to actualize it.[^121] The fact that he never ordained women, never established convents, and had no female dharma heirs suggests a significant gap between his philosophical commitments and his practical actions.[^122] Contemporary feminist Buddhist scholars view this as a serious limitation in his legacy, arguing that theoretical equality without institutional support perpetuates patriarchal structures.[^123]

Some critics question whether Dōgen's emphasis on monastic practice and his rejection of engagement with secular society represents an unfortunate otherworldliness. Unlike Eisai, who actively engaged with secular authorities and sought to make Zen relevant to Japanese society at large, Dōgen withdrew to remote mountains and focused exclusively on intensive monastic training.[^124] Critics argue this represents an abdication of social responsibility and limited the potential social impact of his teachings.[^125]

The difficulty and obscurity of Dōgen's writing has also drawn criticism. His philosophical language is often extraordinarily dense, and his texts can differ in translation "to the point of unrecognizability," making his thought inaccessible to many readers.[^126] Some critics suggest this obscurity reflects conceptual confusion rather than philosophical depth, or that Dōgen's resistance to systematic exposition undermines the coherence of his philosophical project.[^127]

Modern scholars debate whether the traditional enlightenment narrative about Dōgen—particularly the story of Rujing's reprimand of a sleeping monk triggering Dōgen's great awakening—is historically accurate or later hagiographical fiction.[^128] This scholarly skepticism about traditional accounts raises questions about how much we really know about Dōgen's actual experiences and whether his legacy has been distorted by sectarian myth-making.[^129]

Finally, some critics argue that Dōgen's approach is ultimately too quietistic, emphasizing inward meditation at the expense of engaged compassionate action in the world. While Dōgen spoke of saving all beings, his practical emphasis remained overwhelmingly on individual sitting practice, with less attention to how enlightened practitioners should actively work to reduce suffering in the world.[^130]
