## Summary

Allama Prabhu was a 12th-century Kannada mystic, philosopher, and Vachana poet who was a contemporary of Basavanna. He was the president of the Anubhava Mantapa, the 'Hall of Spiritual Experience' established by Basavanna. He is considered the most philosophically profound of the Vachana poets, exploring the nature of consciousness, void (shunya), and the dissolution of ego. His Vachanas represent some of the deepest mystical poetry in any Indian language.
