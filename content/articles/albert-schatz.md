## Summary

Albert Schatz was the co-discoverer of streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis, while working as a graduate student under Selman Waksman. Though he isolated the antibiotic and was named on the patent, Waksman received sole credit and the Nobel Prize. Schatz sued and won a share of royalties but was marginalized in his career.
