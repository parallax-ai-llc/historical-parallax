## Summary

Toyama Kametaro was a Japanese geneticist who confirmed Mendel's laws of inheritance using silkworms in 1906, providing important validation of Mendelian genetics in a non-plant species. His silkworm genetics research was among the earliest genetic studies in Japan and contributed to both basic science and practical sericulture.
