## Summary

John Conway made extraordinary contributions to many areas of mathematics including group theory, number theory, coding theory, and combinatorial game theory. He invented the Game of Life, a cellular automaton that demonstrated how complex patterns emerge from simple rules. He also discovered surreal numbers and the Conway groups in finite group theory.
