## Summary

Pangeran Antasari (1809 – 11 October 1862) was the 20th Sultan of Banjar who led the armed resistance against Dutch colonial forces during the Banjarmasin War (1859–1863). Born as Gusti Inu Kartapati, he rose from humble circumstances to become a unifying leader who earned the title Panembahan Amiruddin Khalifatul Mukminin (Leader of the Faithful). Despite being offered wealth and power by the Dutch in exchange for surrender, he maintained his resistance until his death from smallpox in 1862. He was posthumously declared a National Hero of Indonesia in 1968.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Pangeran Antasari was born in 1809 in Sungai Batang, Martapura, South Kalimantan, with the birth name Gusti Inu Kartapati.[^3][^4] He was the son of Pangeran Masohut (Mas'ud) bin Pangeran Amir and his mother was Gusti Hadijah binti Sultan Sulaiman, making him a prince from a line of the Banjar royal family whose power had been usurped in the 18th century.[^5][^6] His grandfather was Prince Amir, connecting him to the older lineage of Banjar rulers who had been displaced from power.

Unlike typical aristocratic children of his time, Antasari faced misfortune from childhood due to ongoing conflicts between two families competing for the Banjar throne.[^7] As a result of these extended family conflicts and political instability, young Pangeran Antasari was cast out from the palace and grew up among common people, working hard to support his family.[^8] This early experience living outside the palace walls gave him unique insight into the struggles of ordinary Banjarese people and forged his character through hardship.

During his formative years, Antasari received education in Islamic religious knowledge, which would later prove crucial to his leadership role.[^9] His religious education enabled him to be recognized not only as a political leader but also as a spiritual authority among the Muslim population of South Kalimantan. Growing up during a period of increasing Dutch colonial interference in Banjar affairs, the young prince witnessed firsthand the erosion of indigenous sovereignty and the exploitation of local resources by foreign powers.

He had a younger sister named Ratu Antasari (also known as Ratu Sultan Abdul Rahman), who tragically died after giving birth to a child named Rakhmatillah, who was an heir to the Banjar sultanate, though the infant also died while still young.[^10] These family tragedies and the broader political instability of his youth shaped Antasari's understanding of the fragility of power and the importance of defending his people's interests.

## Rise to Power

The path to Pangeran Antasari's emergence as a leader began with a succession crisis following the death of Sultan Adam in November 1857.[^11] The succession became highly contentious when the Dutch colonial authorities interfered to install their preferred candidate. In 1852, when the Sultan's heir-apparent died, the Dutch replaced him with Tamjied Illah (also spelled Tamjidillah), whom they considered more amenable to colonial interests.[^12] Sultan Adam had proposed making Prince Hidayatullah the crown prince, but the Resident and Governor General rejected this, instead appointing Tamjidillah as crown prince and mangkubumi official.[^13]

Tamjid was formally installed by the Dutch resident van Bentheim in Martapura, but this succession was deeply unpopular among many Banjarese.[^14] Pangeran Antasari was particularly concerned about this coronation, as Tamjidillah's ascension was backed by the Dutch colonials who were looking to sow unrest and discord to make their attempts to take over Borneo easier.[^15] The Dutch tried to elevate Tamjidillah because he promised to make things easier for colonial exploitation, in direct contrast to Sultan Adam's preference for the more independent-minded Hidayatullah.[^16]

In early 1859, a revolt broke out east of Martapura, and the political situation deteriorated rapidly.[^17] Tamjid abdicated the throne in June 1859 when he felt unable to continue his reign amidst the escalating rebellion.[^18] Hidayatullah was crowned by the Banjar commanders as sultan in September 1859, but the Dutch were not satisfied with this development.[^19] The colonial authorities then exiled Hidayatullah and unilaterally dissolved the sultanate in 1862.[^20]

In response to this colonial aggression, Dayak commanders, fighters, Islamic scholars, and Banjar nobles appointed Pangeran Antasari as Sultan of Banjar with the title "Panembahan Amiruddin Khalifatul Mukminin" on 14 March 1862.[^21][^22] This title made him not only a political ruler but also a religious leader (khalifah) for his people, embodying both temporal and spiritual authority. Antasari was not only considered a leader of the Banjar people; he was also recognized as the leader of the Ngaju, Maanyan, Siang, Sihong, Kutai, Pasir, Murung, Bakumpai, and several other tribes living in the region and interior or along the Barito River, both Muslim and those practicing Kaharingan (indigenous beliefs).[^23]

## Major Achievements

Pangeran Antasari's most significant achievement was his successful organization and leadership of a multi-ethnic, inter-religious coalition against Dutch colonial expansion in South Kalimantan. When the Banjarmasin War broke out on 18 April 1859, Antasari's alliance was able to field some 6,000 armed men, demonstrating his remarkable ability to mobilize and coordinate diverse groups.[^24][^25]

The war began with a coordinated attack on 25 April 1859, when Pangeran Antasari led 300 of his soldiers to attack the Dutch-owned coal mine in Pengaron.[^26] These coal mines, known as "Oranje Nassau," had been run by the colonial government using convict labor from 1849 to 1884, representing a clear symbol of economic exploitation.[^27] The Dutch had rented the land from Sultan Adam and operated mining operations that benefited colonial interests at the expense of local populations.[^28] The attack on Pengaron was strategically significant, striking at the economic heart of Dutch colonial operations in the region.

Antasari demonstrated sophisticated military coordination by cooperating with leaders from Martapura, Kapuas, Pelaihari, Barito, and Kahayan.[^29] His forces attacked the Dutch in Gunung Jabuk and the coal mines in Pengaron, while his allies simultaneously attacked other Dutch posts and ships.[^30] In December 1859, the resistance achieved a significant victory when they killed Lieutenants Van der Velde and Bangert by sinking the ship Onrust, along with destroying installations at the Julia Hermina coal mine at Kalangan.[^31] On 1 May 1859, all Europeans at the coal mine, including Englishman James Motley, his wife, and three children, died in the fighting, along with those at the missionary settlement near Poctor Petak.[^32]

During the war, Pangeran Antasari led troops in the strategically important Barito, Kapuas, and Katingan regions, which frequently became targets of Dutch military attacks specifically because of his troublesome presence.[^33] By the end of 1859, the battlefield had spread across three locations, with Antasari commanding the fighting along the vital Barito River corridor.[^34] He applied guerrilla warfare strategy effectively, building defense fortresses in remote areas like Gunung Sulit, Guyu, Bayan Begok, and Liang Umbung, which were chosen because the geographical terrain was difficult for Dutch forces to reach.[^35]

On 24 September 1861, Antasari, together with Prince Miradipa and Tumenggung Mancanegara, successfully defended Tundakan fort against Dutch assault.[^36] He also defended a fort in Mount Tongka on 8 November 1861 alongside Gusti Umar and Tumenggung Surapati, demonstrating a coordinated defensive strategy using multiple fortified positions.[^37] These successful defenses showed his tactical acumen in utilizing terrain and fortifications to offset Dutch technological and numerical advantages.

Perhaps his most remarkable achievement was his success in unifying diverse ethnic and religious groups under a common cause. He relied on social and cultural networks, building closeness with the Dayak tribes through political relations and kinship ties, and in several battles, Dayak forces appeared at the forefront of resistance.[^38] This cross-cultural coalition was unprecedented and demonstrated Antasari's inclusive leadership style. The movement he led was framed as a holy war (perang sabil) against non-believers, providing religious legitimacy that strengthened Muslim commitment while still maintaining alliances with non-Muslim indigenous groups.[^39]

Antasari's principled stance was evident when he rejected Dutch attempts to negotiate an end to the war, in which they offered him wealth and power in exchange for his surrender.[^40][^41] This refusal to compromise demonstrated his commitment to independence over personal gain. For Antasari, there was no reason to stop fighting, and he accepted the position entrusted to him with a sense of full responsibility to Allah and the people.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Pangeran Antasari is celebrated as a national hero in Indonesia, the historical record reveals complexities and controversies surrounding his resistance movement. The violence of the Banjarmasin War resulted in significant casualties on all sides, including civilian deaths. On 1 May 1859, all Europeans at the Julia Hermina coal mine at Kalangan were killed, including Englishman James Motley, his wife, and three children, as well as those at the missionary settlement near Poctor Petak.[^43] The targeting of civilian mining and missionary personnel, while strategically aimed at colonial economic and cultural infrastructure, raised questions about the conduct of the resistance.

The warfare in the Pengaron mining region involved brutal fighting that resulted in the deaths of approximately 165 coal mining laborers, with twenty Dutch casualties including Wijnmalen, the director of coal mining at Pengaron, and engineer Motley.[^44] The high number of laborer casualties—many of whom were likely coerced convict workers rather than willing participants in colonial exploitation—illustrates the human cost of the conflict beyond the colonial authorities themselves.

The movement led by Pangeran Antasari was explicitly framed as a holy war (perang sabil) against non-believers, which could be interpreted as having religious exclusionary dimensions, though this was tempered by his practical alliances with non-Muslim Dayak groups.[^45] The religious framing of the conflict may have intensified communal tensions and made negotiated settlements more difficult to achieve, as it cast the struggle in absolute moral terms that allowed little room for compromise.

The ultimate military outcome of the Banjarmasin War was a defeat for the resistance forces. The war ended with a Dutch victory in 1863, resulting in the complete abolition of the Sultanate of Banjarmasin and the territory being placed under direct control of Batavia.[^46][^47] Critics might argue that Antasari's uncompromising stance, while principled, led to the total destruction of Banjar autonomy rather than preserving some degree of sovereignty through negotiation. The Dutch dissolved the sultanate entirely rather than maintaining it as even a nominal entity, representing a complete loss of indigenous political structures.

The prolonged conflict also brought tremendous suffering to the civilian population of South Kalimantan. An outbreak of smallpox that led to Antasari's death on 11 October 1862 was described as epidemic in South Kalimantan at that time, suggesting that the war's disruption may have contributed to public health crises.[^48] The continuation of resistance by his son Muhammad Seman until 1905 meant that sporadic fighting continued for over four decades after the initial conflict, perpetuating instability and preventing peaceful development.[^49]

---

## Personal Life

Pangeran Antasari had a large family, with 3 sons and 8 daughters.[^50] His most historically significant son was Muhammad Seman (1836 – 24 January 1905), who would continue his father's resistance against Dutch colonial forces after Antasari's death.[^51] Approximately a month after Antasari's death, on 8 November 1862, Muhammad Seman formed a kingdom with the capital city of Muara Teweh and continued the armed struggle.[^52] One of his daughters was Ratoe Hasiah, who married Pangeran Wira Kasoema and had a daughter named Ratoe Sjerief Aboe Bakar, continuing the royal lineage.[^53]

Historical sources do not provide detailed information about Antasari's wives or the specifics of his domestic arrangements, which was common for biographical accounts of this period that focused primarily on political and military activities. However, having eleven children suggests a substantial household and family life that existed alongside his military and political responsibilities.

Pangeran Antasari possessed exemplary character traits that were widely recognized by his contemporaries and recorded in historical accounts. He was described as being honest (ujur), simple, frugal and humble (bersahaja), firmly upholding religious principles and convictions, and fighting for the interests of his community.[^54] These personal qualities contributed significantly to his ability to inspire loyalty among diverse followers from different ethnic and religious backgrounds.

He was known as a charismatic figure who commanded deep respect and devotion.[^55] His personal motto, "Haram manyarah waja sampai kaputing" (It is forbidden to surrender until the last drop of blood), reflected his unwavering determination and became emblematic of his character.[^56][^57] Another saying attributed to him was "Dalas pagat gulu lamun manyarah kahada" (better to have the neck severed than to ever surrender), which further demonstrated his uncompromising nature.[^58]

Antasari's personality combined religious devotion with military leadership. His Islamic religious knowledge earned him recognition not only as a movement leader but also as a religious leader, which provided spiritual legitimacy to his political authority.[^59] He was given the title 'Panembahan Amiruddin Khaliful Mukmin' on 14 March 1862, which made him a religious leader for his people and in his position as sultan, he continued the struggle with the spirit of jihad against colonization, which in that context was accepted as a form of defense of homeland and religion.[^60][^61]

Despite his royal lineage, Antasari maintained a simple and approachable demeanor that endeared him to common people, perhaps influenced by his early years living outside the palace. His famous declaration "siapa nang babaik-baik lawan walanda, tujuh turunan kada aku rawa" (whoever sides with the Dutch will not be acknowledged for seven generations) emphasized that there was no compromise with colonizers and the importance of unity against Dutch colonial forces.[^62] This uncompromising stance defined both his public leadership and his personal character until his death from smallpox on 11 October 1862, which occurred while he was preparing a large-scale attack against the Dutch.[^63][^64]

## Legacy

Pangeran Antasari's legacy as a symbol of resistance against colonialism has endured long after his death. In 1968, he was declared a National Hero of Indonesia by President Suharto through presidential decree No. 06/TK/1968, officially recognizing his contribution to the Indonesian independence struggle over a century after his death.[^65][^66] This posthumous honor placed him among the pantheon of Indonesian national heroes who fought against colonial oppression.

His name has been immortalized in numerous institutions and places throughout Indonesia, particularly in South Kalimantan. The province is nicknamed "Bumi Antasari" (Land of Antasari) in his honor.[^67] Korem 101/Antasari, a military regional command, bears his name, connecting his legacy to Indonesia's modern armed forces.[^68] The Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Antasari, an Islamic state university in Banjarmasin and Banjarbaru, was named after him, ensuring that generations of students learn about this historical figure.[^69]

The place where he was buried in Banjarmasin was later named the Antasari Heroes' Cemetery, and several other resistance leaders from different periods were subsequently buried there, making it a site of national remembrance.[^70] This cemetery serves as a physical memorial where Indonesians can pay respects to those who fought for independence.

Antasari appears on Indonesian currency, featured on the obverse of the 2009 series 2,000 rupiah bill, which shows traditional Bornean dancers on the reverse.[^71] This placement on national currency ensures that his image and story reach millions of Indonesians in their daily lives, keeping his memory alive in the most practical way possible. In the mid-1990s, a documentary on Antasari's life was produced, bringing his story to contemporary audiences through modern media.[^72]

His resistance had lasting military consequences beyond his own lifetime. After Antasari's death in 1862, his son Muhammad Seman continued the struggle against the Dutch, with the resistance not ending until Seman's death in 1905.[^73] Sultan Muhammad Seman carried out operations in the Dusun Hulu area at the end of August 1883 and repeatedly attacked the Dutch post at Muara Teweh, maintaining active resistance for over four decades after his father's initial uprising.[^74] While the official Banjarmasin War ended with Dutch victory in 1863, occasional sporadic fighting continued until 1905, demonstrating the enduring spirit of resistance that Antasari had ignited.[^75]

The cultural impact of Antasari's resistance extends beyond formal monuments and institutions. His famous motto "Haram Manyarah Waja Sampai Kaputing" has become a rallying cry used by Indonesian political figures and activists to symbolize determination and refusal to surrender in various contexts.[^76] The phrase has been invoked in contemporary Indonesian politics, showing how Antasari's words continue to resonate with modern audiences facing different challenges.

Academic research continues to examine Antasari's life and leadership. Scholarly works analyze his leadership values and heroism as sources for character education in social studies curricula, ensuring that his example influences Indonesian youth.[^77] Research publications document his strategic military leadership, his ability to build cross-ethnic coalitions, and his role in the broader context of anti-colonial movements in Southeast Asia.[^78]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars and historians have praised Pangeran Antasari as an exemplary leader who demonstrated remarkable strategic thinking and moral courage during a critical period in Indonesian history. Academic research emphasizes his leadership values, including his honesty, humility, religious devotion, and commitment to community interests, positioning him as a model for character education.[^79] His ability to unite diverse ethnic groups—Banjar, Dayak, and other indigenous communities along the Barito River—under a common cause against colonial oppression is viewed as evidence of exceptional diplomatic and leadership skills.[^80]

Historians highlight his strategic military acumen in employing guerrilla warfare tactics and establishing fortified positions in geographically challenging terrain that neutralized Dutch technological advantages.[^81] His successful defense of fortifications like Tundakan and Mount Tongka demonstrated tactical sophistication and the ability to maximize the defensive capabilities of his forces.[^82] The coordinated attacks he orchestrated across multiple locations simultaneously—at Pengaron coal mines, Gunung Jabuk, and other Dutch posts—showed advanced understanding of combined operations.[^83]

Indonesian nationalist historians particularly celebrate Antasari's unwavering principles and refusal to compromise. His rejection of Dutch offers of wealth and power in exchange for surrender is viewed as demonstrating moral integrity and prioritizing collective freedom over personal gain.[^84] The fact that he continued fighting until his death from smallpox while preparing another major offensive illustrates his total commitment to the cause of independence.[^85]

Religious scholars note his dual role as both political and spiritual leader, holding the title Khalifatul Mukminin (Leader of the Faithful), which provided religious legitimacy to the resistance movement and mobilized Muslim populations through the framework of jihad.[^86] His religious education and knowledge enabled him to frame the anti-colonial struggle in terms that resonated deeply with the Islamic identity of many Banjarese people, while still maintaining practical alliances with non-Muslim Dayak groups, showing political pragmatism alongside religious commitment.[^87]

Contemporary Indonesian society has embraced Antasari as a symbol of resistance against injustice and foreign domination. His famous sayings, particularly "Haram Manyarah Waja Sampai Kaputing," continue to inspire Indonesians facing various challenges, demonstrating the enduring relevance of his message of unwavering determination.[^88] The continuation of armed resistance by his son Muhammad Seman until 1905 is seen as testament to the powerful legacy he established and the deep commitment he instilled in his followers.[^89]

### Negative Views

Critical historians have pointed to the ultimate military failure of the Banjarmasin War, which resulted in the complete abolition of the Sultanate of Banjarmasin and the imposition of direct Dutch colonial control over the territory.[^90] From this perspective, Antasari's uncompromising stance, while morally principled, may have foreclosed opportunities for negotiated settlement that could have preserved some degree of Banjar autonomy or indigenous political structures. The Dutch dissolved the sultanate entirely rather than maintaining it even as a nominal entity, representing a total loss that might have been partially avoided through diplomatic flexibility.

The human cost of the prolonged conflict raises questions about the strategic wisdom of sustained armed resistance against a militarily superior colonial power. The war resulted in significant civilian casualties, including the deaths of approximately 165 coal mining laborers at Pengaron, many of whom were likely coerced convict workers rather than active supporters of colonialism.[^91] The civilian deaths at the Julia Hermina coal mine, including women and children, and at missionary settlements, though occurring in the context of targeting colonial infrastructure, demonstrated the indiscriminate violence that characterized the conflict.[^92]

The framing of the resistance as a holy war (perang sabil) against non-believers, while effective for mobilizing Muslim support, potentially contributed to religious polarization and communal tensions.[^93] Critics might argue that this religious framing made peaceful coexistence and negotiated settlement more difficult by casting the conflict in absolute moral and religious terms that allowed little room for compromise or pragmatic accommodation.

The prolonged suffering of the South Kalimantan population during and after the war, including the smallpox epidemic that killed Antasari himself and was described as epidemic throughout the region, suggests that the conflict may have contributed to public health crises and general humanitarian suffering.[^94] The continuation of sporadic fighting until 1905—over four decades after the initial uprising—meant that the region experienced prolonged instability that prevented peaceful development and economic recovery.[^95]

Some analysts note that while Antasari is celebrated in Indonesian nationalist historiography, the actual outcome of his resistance was a tightening rather than loosening of Dutch colonial control. The unilateral dissolution of the sultanate in 1862 and the imposition of direct Batavian rule represented a more thorough colonization than had existed previously, when the Dutch had worked through local sultanate structures.[^96] This raises counterfactual questions about whether a different approach might have achieved better long-term outcomes for indigenous political autonomy.
