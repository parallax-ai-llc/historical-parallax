## Summary

Between 2017 and 2019, Venezuela descended into one of the worst political and humanitarian crises in Latin American history. What began as protests against President Nicolás Maduro's government became a constitutional struggle, a parallel government, and ultimately a standoff between two men each claiming to be president—while millions of Venezuelans fled the country and those who remained faced starvation.[^1]

In 2017, the Maduro government stripped the opposition-controlled National Assembly of its powers and rewrote the constitution. Mass protests erupted: over 120 people died, thousands were arrested, and the regime consolidated control. In 2019, Juan Guaidó, the assembly president, declared himself the legitimate interim president, recognized by over 50 countries. But Maduro had the military, and military power proved decisive.[^2]

By 2019, over 4 million Venezuelans had fled—the largest displacement crisis in the Western Hemisphere. Those who stayed faced hyperinflation, food shortages, and a collapsing healthcare system. The protests failed to remove Maduro. The opposition was divided and eventually marginalized. The crisis showed how an authoritarian government with military loyalty and oil wealth could survive international isolation, mass protests, and economic collapse.[^3]

## Why Did Maduro Survive?

- Russia, China provided loans
- Cuba provided intelligence support

### Opposition Weaknesses

**Fragmentation:**
- Multiple leaders, competing agendas
- No unified strategy
- International recognition didn't translate to power
- Guaidó couldn't deliver

### Regime Willingness to Repress

**No limits:**
- Arbitrary detention
- Torture documented
- Military courts for civilians

## Aftermath

### Guaidó's Fade

**2020-2021:**
- COVID provided excuse for fewer protests
- Guaidó lost momentum
- International recognition slowly withdrawn
- US shifted approach (2023)

## Historical Assessment

### What Went Wrong?

**Opposition:**
- Never won military
- Relied on international pressure that didn't work
- Didn't build sustained domestic pressure

**International community:**
- Sanctions hurt economy but didn't topple regime
- Recognition of Guaidó didn't translate to action
- No military intervention (wisely or not)

### Lessons

**What Venezuela shows:**
- Authoritarian regimes can survive economic collapse
- Military loyalty is decisive
- International isolation insufficient alone
- Oil wealth buys time

### Comparison

| Crisis | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Arab Spring (Tunisia) | Success |
| Arab Spring (Syria) | Civil war |
| **Venezuela** | **Regime survived** |
