## Summary

Abu Hamid al-Ghazali is considered one of the most important scholars in Islamic history. His Ihya Ulum al-Din (Revival of the Religious Sciences) integrated Sufi spirituality into orthodox Sunni Islam. He attacked Greek-influenced philosophy in Tahafut al-Falasifa (The Incoherence of the Philosophers). After a spiritual crisis, he abandoned his prestigious position to pursue Sufism. He is sometimes called the 'Proof of Islam' (Hujjat al-Islam).
