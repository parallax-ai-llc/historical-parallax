## Summary

The **Holodomor** (Ukrainian: "death by hunger") was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine from 1932 to 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. Unlike famines caused by crop failure, the Holodomor was engineered by **Joseph Stalin**'s regime through forced collectivization, impossibly high grain quotas, and the confiscation of all food sources. It is widely recognized as a genocide aimed at crushing Ukrainian nationalism and the peasantry's resistance to Soviet rule.

## Causes: Engineered Starvation

### Forced Collectivization
In the late 1920s, Stalin ordered the collectivization of agriculture, forcing independent farmers (*kulaks*) to give up their land and livestock to state-run farms (*kolkhozes*). Resistance was fierce; farmers slaughtered their own cattle rather than hand them over.

### The "Five Stalks of Grain" Law
In August 1932, Stalin enacted a decree punishing the theft of "socialist property."
*   **Penalty:** People could be shot or imprisoned for 10 years for taking even a handful of grain ("five stalks") from the fields to feed their starving families.
*   **Watchtowers:** Guard towers were built in the fields to shoot peasants picking leftover crops.

### The Blacklist
Villages that failed to meet the impossible grain quotas were placed on a "black list" (*chorna doshka*).
*   **Blockade:** These villages were blockaded by troops. No food could enter, and no goods could leave.
*   **Search Brigades:** "Tow brigades" of activists went house to house, using metal rods to probe floors and walls, confiscating not just grain but all food (potatoes, beets, beans) and even seed reserves for the next planting.

## Horror of the Famine

### "Internal Passports"
As starvation set in, peasants tried to flee to the cities or Russia to find food. In January 1933, Stalin issued a directive closing the borders of Ukraine and the Kuban region.
*   **Cordon:** Police and military units blocked roads and railways. Peasants caught trying to leave were arrested and sent back to their villages to die.

### Cannibalism
The hunger drove people to madness.
*   **Desperation:** People ate grass, tree bark, dogs, cats, and leather shoes.
*   **Cannibalism:** By 1933, widespread acts of cannibalism were reported. Parents killed children for food; children ate siblings. The Soviet secret police (OGPU) recorded thousands of cases, but the regime suppressed the information. A common survival phrase was: *"Do not eat your children."*

## The Cover-Up

### "There is no famine"
While millions died, the Soviet Union continued to **export grain** to the West to fund industrialization.
*   **Walter Duranty:** The *New York Times* Moscow bureau chief famously won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting that denied the famine, writing "Any report of a famine in Russia is today an exaggeration or malignant propaganda."
*   **Gareth Jones:** A Welsh journalist who secretly visited Ukraine exposed the truth ("I walked through villages and twelve collective farms. Everywhere was the cry, 'There is no bread. We are dying.'"), but he was smeared by the Soviet press machine.

### Census Suppression
The 1937 Soviet census revealed a massive population drop in Ukraine. Stalin had the census administrators arrested and shot, and the results were buried for decades.

## Legacy

The Holodomor broke the backbone of the Ukrainian peasantry and culture.
*   **Genocide Recognition:** Since 2006, Ukraine and over 30 other countries (plus the European Parliament) have recognized the Holodomor as a genocide.
*   **Remembrance:** Every year on the fourth Saturday of November, candles are lit in memory of the victims.
