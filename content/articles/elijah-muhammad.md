## Summary

Elijah Muhammad was the leader of the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975. He taught a heterodox form of Islam that emphasized Black separatism and self-sufficiency. Under his leadership, the Nation of Islam grew from a small sect to a major force in African American life, with temples across the country. He mentored Malcolm X, who later broke with the movement. After his death, his son Warith Deen Mohammed led most followers toward orthodox Sunni Islam.
