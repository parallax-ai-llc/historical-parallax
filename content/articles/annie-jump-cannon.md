## Summary

Annie Jump Cannon was an American astronomer who created the Harvard spectral classification system (OBAFGKM) still used today to classify stars by their temperatures. She classified about 350,000 stellar spectra during her career, more than any other person. She was part of the 'Harvard Computers,' a group of women hired by Edward Pickering to catalog stars. Cannon was deaf for most of her life but became one of the most prolific astronomers in history.
