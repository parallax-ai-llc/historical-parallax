## Summary

Masamoto Yashiro is a Japanese banking executive who served as CEO of Shinsei Bank (formerly Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan). After the bank's collapse during Japan's banking crisis, it was privatized and Yashiro led its transformation into a modern retail and corporate bank. His Western management style was controversial in Japanese banking circles but demonstrated how failed institutions could be revitalized.
