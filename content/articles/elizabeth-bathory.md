## Summary
Countess Elizabeth Báthory is often cited as the most prolific female serial killer in history, accused of torturing and killing hundreds of young women between 1585 and 1609. The legend claims she bathed in victims' blood for youth, though the charges' accuracy is debated.

## Early Life
Born August 7, 1560, into one of Hungary's most powerful families. Highly educated, she spoke four languages. She married Count Ferenc Nádasdy in 1575 and resided at Csejte Castle. Her husband died in 1604. [^1]

## Criminal Career
According to testimony from over 300 witnesses, Báthory and her servants tortured and killed young women using beating, burning, freezing, and mutilation. Estimates range from 80 to 650 victims. The claim of bathing in blood may be legend. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
King Matthias II ordered investigation in 1610. Her castle was raided December 30, 1610. Four servants were tried and executed. Due to her noble status, Báthory was never tried but was sealed in rooms at Csejte Castle. She was found dead August 21, 1614. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives

- Testimony reliability is questioned

## Negative Perspectives
