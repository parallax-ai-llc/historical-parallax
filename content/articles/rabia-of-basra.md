## Summary

Rabia al-Adawiyya of Basra was an early Muslim mystic who introduced the concept of Divine Love (ishq-e-ilahi) into Sufi mysticism. Born into poverty and reportedly sold into slavery, she later became the most revered woman saint in Islam. She taught disinterested love of God — loving God for God's sake, not from fear or desire for reward. Her teachings transformed Sufism from an ascetic movement into a love-centered mystical tradition.
