## Summary

Madhava of Sangamagrama was an Indian mathematician and astronomer who founded the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics. He discovered the infinite series expansions of trigonometric functions (now known as Maclaurin/Taylor series) approximately 250 years before European mathematicians. He also developed methods of calculus including convergence tests and computed pi to 11 decimal places. His work represents some of the most advanced mathematics before the European Renaissance.
