## Summary

Henry Kaiser was an American industrialist who was central to the U.S. war effort during World War II. He built Liberty ships at unprecedented speed — averaging one ship every day. He also founded Kaiser Permanente, one of America's first HMOs, to provide healthcare for his shipyard workers. After the war, he expanded into aluminum, steel, and automobiles. His innovative management techniques and social welfare programs made him a model of industrial leadership.
