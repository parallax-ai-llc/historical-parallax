## Summary

Paul Tillich was a German-American existentialist theologian and philosopher of religion. His Systematic Theology sought to correlate Christian revelation with existentialist questions about human existence. He described God as the 'Ground of Being' and faith as 'ultimate concern.' He was dismissed from his position in Germany for opposing the Nazis and emigrated to the United States.
