## Summary

Slobodan Milošević was a Yugoslav and Serbian politician who served as President of Serbia from 1989 to 1997 and President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1997 until his overthrow in 2000.[^1] He became the first sitting head of state charged with war crimes by an international tribunal, facing 66 counts of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).[^2] His role in the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which involved ethnic cleansing campaigns in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo, resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people and the displacement of millions.[^3] Milošević died in his prison cell at The Hague on March 11, 2006, before his trial could conclude.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Slobodan Milošević was born on August 20, 1941, in Požarevac, Yugoslavia (now in Serbia), during World War II when his country was occupied by Axis powers.[^5] His parents, Svetozar and Stanislava, were schoolteachers from Montenegro who had been sent to Serbia by the education ministry.[^6] The family faced profound tragedy and political division from the start. In 1947, Milošević's father left the family and returned to Montenegro because he did not agree with the ideals of communism, while his mother remained in Serbia as a devoted communist.[^7]

The shadow of suicide haunted Milošević's formative years. Both of his parents eventually took their own lives—his father in 1962 when Slobodan was 21, and his mother in 1973.[^8] These traumatic losses shaped a young man who would become known for his withdrawn, calculating personality and intense focus on power.

Milošević's academic record was exemplary. He finished his elementary and high school education in Požarevac, where teachers and classmates remembered him as an outstanding student, always attentive and neatly dressed.[^9] Though quiet and solitary by nature, he was politically active even as a teenager, publishing writings in his local high school journal.[^10] His intellectual abilities earned him admission to the prestigious University of Belgrade Faculty of Law, where he joined the League of Socialist Youth of Yugoslavia.[^11]

It was during his university years that Milošević met two people who would profoundly shape his future: his future wife Mirjana "Mira" Marković, whom he had known since high school, and Ivan Stambolić, whose uncle Petar Stambolić had been president of the Serbian Executive Council.[^12] The latter connection would prove crucial for Milošević's career prospects as the two climbed through the party hierarchy together.[^13] Milošević graduated with a law degree in 1964, having distinguished himself as a diligent student who adhered strictly to Communist Party ideals.[^14] At the age of seventeen in 1959, he became a full member of the party, signaling his early commitment to the communist system that he would later manipulate for nationalist purposes.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Milošević's ascent to power followed the classic trajectory of a communist apparatchik, beginning in the economic sector before transitioning to direct political control. After completing his law degree, he worked in various business and government roles through the 1960s and 1970s, always under the patronage of his friend and mentor Ivan Stambolić.[^16] From 1973 to 1978, Milošević held posts as deputy director and later general director at Tehnogas, a major oil company in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.[^17]

His most prominent position in the business world came in 1978 when he became president of Beogradska banka (Beobanka), one of the largest banks in Yugoslavia, a post he held until 1983.[^18] During his tenure from 1979-1983 as president of the Executive Board of the United Belgrade Bank, Milošević oversaw major financial operations, including a syndicated credit agreement signed in Luxembourg in 1979 through the European Investment Bank for $300 million for the Brotherhood-Unity highway project.[^19] This experience in high finance gave him valuable connections and insights into economic leverage that he would later use politically.

Milošević entered politics full-time in 1984 as a protégé of Ivan Stambolić, who was then head of the League of Communists of Serbia.[^20] He was elected president of the Belgrade Communist Party in 1984, and one of his first actions was to crack down on political dissidents.[^21] In May 1986, Milošević was named head of the Serbian Communist Party, with Stambolić spending three days advocating for his election and finally securing him the tightest victory ever in the history of Serbian Communist Party internal elections.[^22]

The pivotal moment that transformed Milošević from a faceless bureaucrat into a national figure occurred on April 24, 1987, in Kosovo Polje.[^23] Milošević had been sent to Kosovo to quell nationalist feelings among the Serb minority, but instead, he made a fateful decision that would alter Balkans history. When Serb demonstrators clashed with police outside a building where he was meeting with local party officials, Milošević came outside and declared: "No one should dare to bite you."[^24] This sentence was said to have "enthroned him as a tsar," and over the next two years, Milošević emerged as the undisputed leader of Serbia.[^25]

After this Kosovo turning point, Milošević broke with the Communist Party line and aligned himself with the Serb nationalists in the Kosovo region, publicly embracing the cause of the beleaguered Serb minority.[^26] He soon introduced a new populist political style to Serbia, appealing directly to the Serbian people over the heads of party officials and calling for an "antibureaucratic revolution."[^27] This represented a dramatic shift from communist internationalism to ethnic nationalism.

The transformation proved costly for his former mentor. Milošević used the Kosovo issue to turn the party against Stambolić, whom he portrayed as weak on Serbian interests.[^28] At a nationally televised party meeting in September 1987, leading communists severely criticized Stambolić's regime for its supposed failure to defend Serbian interests in Kosovo.[^29] Two months later, Stambolić resigned, having been systematically undermined by his former protégé.[^30] The betrayal was complete—and would have even darker consequences years later when Stambolić mysteriously disappeared on August 25, 2000, murdered by Special Operations Unit officers on orders that a court later determined came from Milošević himself.[^31]

In late 1987 and early 1988, Milošević consolidated his political power by removing thousands of officials from government and effectively using mob politics to achieve his goals.[^32] In 1988, he replaced the party leadership in the provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo with his own supporters, giving him control over their votes in the federal presidency.[^33] By 1989, Milošević had effectively ended Kosovo's autonomy and positioned himself as the champion of Serbian nationalism, ready to lead Serbia through the turbulent collapse of Yugoslavia.

## Major Achievements

On June 28, 1989, Milošević delivered what would become his most famous speech at the Gazimestan monument on the Kosovo field, marking the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo before an estimated crowd of one million or more attendees.[^34] The speech emphasized Serbian unity with the backdrop slogan "Samo Sloga Srbina Spašava" (Only Unity Saves the Serbs).[^35] The speech contained ominous references to the possibility of "armed battles" in Serbia's future national development, with Milošević stating: "If we have to fight, by God we are going to fight. I hope that they will not be so crazy as to fight against us. If we do not know how to work properly or run an economy, at least we know how to fight properly."[^36] Crowds sang "Tsar Lazar, you were not lucky enough to have Sloba by your side" and dubbed Milošević "Little Lazar," comparing him to the medieval Serbian prince who died in the 1389 battle.[^37]

Milošević's rhetoric resonated powerfully with the Serbian population, and he gained enormous popularity by positioning himself as a defender of Serbian identity and rights against perceived threats from other Yugoslav republics and ethnic minorities.[^38] He "catapulted from the ranks of communist functionaries to become the most popular Serbian leader of the century by embracing and promoting nationalism," transforming his image from a functionary to "the voice of Serbian nationalism."[^39]

In the political arena, Milošević demonstrated considerable skill at consolidating power across multiple institutions. Between 1989 and 1997, he served as President of Serbia, and from 1997 until 2000, he held the position of President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.[^40] During this period, he managed to maintain control despite Yugoslavia's disintegration, economic collapse, and international isolation. His ability to manipulate constitutional arrangements—including switching from the Serbian presidency to the Yugoslav presidency when term limits threatened his power—showed his tactical political acumen.[^41]

One of Milošević's most significant international achievements came with the Dayton Accords in November 1995, which ended the three-and-a-half-year Bosnian War.[^42] The Dayton conference took place from November 1-21, 1995, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, with Milošević representing the interests of the Bosnian Serbs (whom they had empowered him to represent), alongside Croatian President Franjo Tuđman and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegović.[^43] The talks bordered on total failure before an 11th-hour territorial concession by Milošević sealed an imperfect agreement that ended the war in Bosnia.[^44] The agreement created a single sovereign state known as Bosnia and Herzegovina composed of two parts: the largely Serb-populated Republika Srpska and the mainly Croat-Bosniak-populated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.[^45]

The signing of the Dayton Accords allowed for the lifting of most economic sanctions against Serbia, providing temporary relief from the international isolation that had devastated the Serbian economy.[^46] For many in Serbia, Milošević appeared as a successful statesman who had secured Serbian interests at the negotiating table. His supporters viewed him as having protected Serbian populations in Croatia and Bosnia while eventually bringing peace to the region.[^47]

Despite international sanctions, hyperinflation, and economic devastation from war, Milošević maintained significant domestic support. He was listed as the third-most favorably rated politician in Serbia in the last opinion poll before his death.[^48] Tens of thousands of supporters attended his farewell ceremony in Belgrade, demonstrating that "for many Serbs [he remains] a symbol of national pride."[^49] Even decades after his fall from power, "Milošević has many supporters across the region, most notably in Serbia and Bosnia's entity Republika Srpska."[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most severe criticisms of Milošević center on his role in the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, which historians regard as "one of Europe's most destructive conflicts and human rights atrocities since World War II."[^51] When Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on June 25, 1991, Milošević's response set the stage for years of brutal warfare. The Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), at Serbia's behest, intervened militarily, though Milošević later claimed he was "against using the Yugoslav Army in Slovenia."[^52] The Serbian leadership under Milošević had decided to 'give up' Slovenia but fight for Croatia's Serb-populated regions and eventually Bosnia.[^53]

With the help of the JNA and Serbia, Croatian Serbs rebelled, declaring nearly a third of Croatia's territory under their control to be an independent Serb state.[^54] The ICTY declared that Milošević, along with other senior political and military officials, participated in a "common criminal purpose to forcibly and permanently remove non-Serbs from large areas of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina."[^55] In 1991-92, he ordered the intervention of the Serb-led Yugoslav army in Slovenia and Croatia, and in 1992-94, he actively supported Serb militias and their policies of 'ethnic cleansing' in Bosnia-Herzegovina.[^56]

The single most horrific event linked to Milošević's policies was the Srebrenica massacre of July 1995. On July 11, 1995, Bosnian Serb troops led by Ratko Mladić and supported by Milošević's Serbian government seized the UN-protected "safe area" of Srebrenica, ordered the departure of peacekeepers, and carried out what would be legally recognized as genocide.[^57] More than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were killed in and around the town in what constituted "the first legally recognised genocide in Europe since the end of World War II."[^58] While Milošević died before a verdict could be reached in his trial, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded there was no evidence directly linking him to genocide committed by Bosnian Serb forces, but found he had violated the Genocide Convention by failing to prevent genocide from occurring and to hold those involved accountable.[^59]

The Kosovo conflict brought Milošević into direct confrontation with NATO and the international community. In 1999, he ordered a program of ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians that drove hundreds of thousands of them into neighboring countries as refugees.[^60] NATO responded with an aerial bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia lasting 78 days, from March 24 to June 10, 1999.[^61] The NATO intervention was prompted by Yugoslavia's bloodshed and ethnic cleansing, which had the potential to destabilize the entire region.[^62] The indictment against Milošević alleged that forces under his command expelled some 800,000 Kosovo Albanian civilians, murdered hundreds of Kosovo Albanian men, women and children, sexually assaulted many women, and destroyed and looted Kosovo Albanian property.[^63] The overall civilian death toll from NATO's bombing campaign was estimated at around 500 by Human Rights Watch, though the Serbian government placed the figure much higher at 2,500 dead and 12,500 injured.[^64]

Milošević's economic policies brought Serbia to the brink of collapse. Under heavy economic sanctions from the United Nations due to his perceived role in the Yugoslav wars, Serbia's economy entered a prolonged period of collapse and isolation beginning in April 1992.[^65] The combination of sanctions and the National Bank of Yugoslavia's war-related easy money policies contributed to hyperinflation that reached the alarming rate of 313 million percent in January 1994, with daily rates reaching 62 percent.[^66] According to the World Bank, Serbia's economy contracted by 27.2 and 30.5 percent in 1992 and 1993 respectively.[^67] Serbia's GDP dropped from $24 billion in 1990 to below $10 billion in 1993, and just $8.66 billion in 2000.[^68]

On May 24, 1999, Milošević became the first sitting head of state to be charged with war crimes by an international tribunal when the ICTY indicted him for crimes in Kosovo.[^69] Chief Prosecutor Louise Arbour stated: "On May 22, I presented an indictment for confirmation against Slobodan Milošević and four others charging them with crimes against humanity—specifically, murder, deportation and persecutions, and with violations of the laws or customs of war."[^70] By 2001, the Tribunal had confirmed additional indictments against Milošević for crimes in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1991 to 1995 while he was President of the Republic of Serbia.[^71] In total, he faced 66 counts of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes.[^72]

## Personal Life

Slobodan Milošević married Mirjana "Mira" Marković in 1965, having met her when they were in high school together.[^73] Both came from difficult backgrounds—Milošević was a lonely outsider whose parents had both committed suicide, and the two quickly became inseparable after meeting.[^74] According to observers, their bond was extraordinarily strong; she was "considered to be the only person her husband trusted."[^75]

Mira Marković was far more than a political spouse. Born on July 10, 1942, she held a Ph.D. in sociology and taught the subject at the University of Belgrade.[^76] As the leader of her own political party, Yugoslav United Left, she wielded considerable political influence in her own right.[^77] Her influence over Milošević was widely recognized and sometimes criticized. She was "considered a source for the increase in Milošević's strong anti-western rhetoric and actions," with Milošević biographer Slavoljub Đukić telling the Ottawa Citizen in 1998: "She invented him."[^78]

The couple had two children: son Marko, born on July 3, 1974, and daughter Marija.[^79] Marko was allegedly involved in organized crime in Serbia during the Yugoslav Wars until he fled the country following his father's removal from power on October 5, 2000.[^80] Marija founded TV Košava in 1998 and was its owner until the overthrow of Milošević.[^81] The family dynamic appears to have been troubled, with Marija known to have been "at odds with her mother and brother for years" and eventually becoming estranged from them.[^82]

After Milošević's fall from power, his family scattered. Marko fled to Moscow with his sister Marija, mother Mira, and uncle Borislav, where he was later granted refugee status by Russia.[^83] Pursued by Serbian legal authorities on fraud charges, Mira Marković settled in Russia in 2003, with Serbia issuing an arrest warrant that was circulated via Interpol, though Russian authorities refused to arrest her.[^84] She died at the age of 76 in Moscow on April 14, 2019.[^85] The urn containing her ashes was buried next to her late husband in the garden of their family home in the eastern Serbian town of Požarevac.[^86]

Neither of the Milošević children attended their father's funeral in 2006, which led to a public family dispute about the burial arrangements.[^87] Marija publicly called the funeral "scandalous," highlighting the deep divisions within the family even in death.[^88] Milošević's personality was often described as withdrawn, calculating, and intensely private, in stark contrast to his populist public persona. His transformation from a reserved communist technocrat to a fiery nationalist leader remains one of the psychological puzzles of his career.

## Legacy

One observer's assessment of Milošević's legacy is particularly harsh: "Slobodan Milosevic did more damage to Serbia and the Serbian people than any other Serb in history."[^89] His legacy to Serbia includes bringing about the end of Yugoslavia, a country many Serbs loved; over 600,000 Serb refugees and displaced persons in Serbia from Kosovo, Croatia, and Bosnia; thousands killed, wounded, and missing; a healthcare and educational infrastructure critically under-funded and lacking even basic elements; and a society where criminal behavior was nourished rather than suppressed by the state.[^90]

The wars Milošević instigated or supported resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people across the former Yugoslavia and the displacement of millions more.[^91] The ethnic cleansing campaigns he orchestrated or facilitated created demographic changes that persist to this day, with entire regions ethnically homogenized through violence and forced expulsion. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals found he was part of a joint criminal enterprise that used violence such as ethnic cleansing to remove Croats, Bosniaks, and Albanians from parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo.[^92]

Yugoslavia itself ceased to exist as a unified state largely due to Milošević's policies. The federation that had been held together by Josip Broz Tito and the ideology of "brotherhood and unity" fractured along ethnic lines, with Milošević's Serbian nationalism provoking reactive nationalisms in other republics.[^93] By the time of his overthrow in 2000, Yugoslavia had been reduced to just Serbia and Montenegro, and even this rump state would dissolve in 2006, the year of Milošević's death.

The economic devastation Milošević left behind was staggering. The hyperinflation of 1993-1994, international isolation, and the destruction of productive capacity during the wars set Serbian economic development back by decades.[^94] Sanctions, the NATO bombing in 1999, and endemic corruption created a lost generation of economic opportunity. Even two decades after his fall, Serbia's economy has struggled to recover to pre-war levels of prosperity.

Politically, the legacy of Milošević's rule continues to shape Serbian politics, with nationalist movements still influencing the political landscape.[^95] The spectre of Milošević "continues to haunt Serbia," with debates over his legacy remaining divisive in Serbian society.[^96] Some see him as a defender of Serbian interests who was unfairly demonized by the West, while others view him as a war criminal who destroyed Yugoslavia and brought catastrophe to the Serbian people.

The regional impact has been equally profound. The scars of the wars Milošević helped start continue to shape politics and society throughout the Balkans, where ethnic tensions remain high and reconciliation remains incomplete.[^97] Bosnia and Herzegovina remains divided along ethnic lines as established by the Dayton Accords. Kosovo declared independence in 2008, which Serbia still refuses to recognize. Croatia joined the European Union in 2013, while Serbia's path to EU membership remains complicated by unresolved issues stemming from the 1990s wars.

Milošević's trial at The Hague, despite ending without a verdict due to his death, set important precedents in international law. It demonstrated that even sitting heads of state could be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity, establishing principles that would influence later tribunals and the International Criminal Court.[^98]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite widespread international condemnation, Milošević retains defenders and admirers, particularly within Serbia and among Serbian nationalist communities. Tens of thousands of supporters attended a farewell ceremony for Milošević in Belgrade after his death in 2006, demonstrating the enduring emotional connection many Serbians felt toward him.[^99] In the last opinion poll conducted before his death, he was listed as the third-most favorably rated politician in Serbia, indicating substantial popular support even after his fall from power and during his war crimes trial.[^100]

His supporters argue that Milošević was fundamentally a defender of Serbian national interests during the chaotic collapse of Yugoslavia. They contend that he sought to protect Serbian populations who found themselves as minorities in newly independent states like Croatia and Bosnia, where historical memories of World War II atrocities against Serbs by Croatian Ustaše and Bosnian Muslim forces remained vivid.[^101] From this perspective, Milošević's actions were defensive responses to genuine threats against Serbian people, not aggressive expansionism.

Some defenders claim that Western powers unfairly targeted Milošević and Serbia while ignoring crimes committed by Croatian, Bosnian Muslim, and Kosovo Albanian forces against Serbian civilians.[^102] They argue that the ICTY was a political instrument designed to blame Serbs for the Yugoslav Wars while exculpating other parties. The fact that Milošević died before receiving a verdict is sometimes cited as evidence that the prosecution's case was weak or that he was being unfairly persecuted.

Within nationalist circles, Milošević is sometimes portrayed as a victim of Western imperialism who resisted NATO expansion and defended Serbian sovereignty against external interference.[^103] This interpretation has found resonance beyond Serbia. The Christchurch terrorist attacker expressed support for Milošević over NATO, and Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik described NATO's bombing of Serbia as "completely unacceptable" against "our Serbian brothers," demonstrating how Milošević has been appropriated by far-right extremist movements as a symbol of resistance to multiculturalism and Western liberal values.[^104]

Some scholars note that Milošević was "an opportunist rather than a convinced nationalist" who "used Serbian nationalism to win votes" rather than acting from deep ideological conviction.[^105] This interpretation suggests a more complex figure than either the demonic war criminal of Western narratives or the heroic defender of Serbian nationalism presented by his supporters. From this perspective, Milošević was primarily a power-seeking politician who manipulated ethnic tensions for personal political gain rather than a true believer in any particular ideology.

His defenders point to his role in negotiating the Dayton Accords as evidence of his capacity for statesmanship and compromise.[^106] They argue that without his willingness to pressure the Bosnian Serbs to accept the agreement, the war in Bosnia could have continued indefinitely. Similarly, his eventual acceptance of the terms ending the Kosovo War in 1999 is portrayed by some as pragmatic leadership rather than capitulation.

### Negative Views

The preponderance of scholarly and international opinion views Milošević as one of the principal architects of the Yugoslav Wars and the immense human suffering they caused. Historians overwhelmingly regard "Milosevic's war of nationalism and ethnic cleansing as one of Europe's most destructive conflicts and human rights atrocities since World War II."[^107] The systematic campaigns of ethnic cleansing, mass murder, rape as a weapon of war, and cultural destruction that characterized the conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo represent crimes of such magnitude that they triggered the first genocide prosecutions in Europe since the Nuremberg trials.[^108]

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia's extensive investigations documented Milošević's central role in planning and executing campaigns to create ethnically pure territories through violence.[^109] The indictments charged him with leading a "joint criminal enterprise to permanently remove the majority of non-Serbs from large swaths of territory in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo by violent means, with his goal being to establish and control a centralized and ethnically homogenous Serbian state."[^110] While he died before receiving a verdict, substantial evidence was presented during the trial linking him to atrocities across multiple theaters of conflict.

The Srebrenica massacre stands as the most damning evidence of the consequences of Milošević's policies. The systematic murder of more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys in July 1995—the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II—occurred with the support of Milošević's government.[^111] While the International Court of Justice found insufficient evidence to hold Serbia directly responsible for genocide, it determined that Milošević's government had violated the Genocide Convention by failing to prevent the genocide and failing to punish those responsible.[^112]

Critics emphasize the catastrophic damage Milošević inflicted on Serbia itself. One assessment concludes that "Slobodan Milosevic did more damage to Serbia and the Serbian people than any other Serb in history."[^113] His legacy includes the destruction of Yugoslavia, the transformation of Serbia into an international pariah, economic devastation including one of history's worst episodes of hyperinflation, over 600,000 Serbian refugees and displaced persons, thousands of Serbian casualties in wars that achieved no lasting gains, the loss of Kosovo, and the poisoning of Serbia's political culture through years of propaganda, corruption, and authoritarianism.[^114]

Many analysts argue that Milošević cynically manipulated Serbian nationalism for personal power rather than acting from genuine conviction. Before 1987, he was a communist technocrat with no particular nationalist credentials.[^115] His sudden transformation into a firebrand Serbian nationalist appears to have been a calculated political strategy to seize power rather than a deeply held ideological position. By stoking ethnic hatred and historical grievances, he created conflicts that served his political interests while devastating the lives of millions.

The destabilizing effects of Milošević's policies extended far beyond Serbia. The wars he helped initiate created a refugee crisis affecting multiple countries, strengthened organized crime networks that continue to plague the Balkans, and left a legacy of ethnic division and mutual suspicion that impedes regional cooperation and European integration decades later.[^116] Bosnia remains a dysfunctional state divided along ethnic lines. Kosovo's status remains disputed. War criminals remain celebrated as heroes in some communities while being vilified in others.

Human rights organizations and international legal scholars view the Milošević era as representing a catastrophic failure of the international community to prevent atrocities and a cautionary tale about the dangers of ethnic nationalism.[^117] The fact that ethnic cleansing and genocide occurred in Europe in the 1990s, decades after the world pledged "never again" following the Holocaust, represents a profound moral failure that implicates not only Milošević but also the international system that failed to stop him until hundreds of thousands had died.
