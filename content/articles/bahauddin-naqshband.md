## Summary

Bahauddin Naqshband was a Central Asian Sufi master who founded the Naqshbandi order, one of the most important and widespread Sufi orders in Islam. His order emphasized silent dhikr (remembrance of God) over the vocal practices of other orders. He taught strict adherence to the Sunnah and sharia alongside mystical practice. The Naqshbandi order spread across Central Asia, Turkey, South Asia, and beyond.
