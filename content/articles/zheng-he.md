## Summary

Zheng He (1371-1433) was a Chinese Muslim admiral and diplomat who commanded seven massive naval expeditions throughout the Indian Ocean and beyond from 1405 to 1433 under Ming Dynasty Emperor Yongle. His "Treasure Fleet" was the largest maritime force in world history up to that time—with ships dwarfing anything in Europe—visiting Southeast Asia, India, Arabia, and East Africa. The voyages demonstrated Chinese naval superiority, established tributary relationships, and facilitated trade across half the world. After Zheng He's death, China abruptly abandoned maritime exploration and turned inward, one of history's great "what ifs."

## Activities and Impact

- Defeated pirates in Straits of Malacca
- Captured hostile Ceylon king
- Intervened in local conflicts

### Cultural Exchange

- Muslim envoys visited Mecca
- Established Chinese communities abroad
- Spread knowledge of Chinese civilization

---

## Why Voyages Stopped

### Emperor Yongle's Death (1424)

Successor emperors less interested.

### Confucian Opposition

**Officials Argued:**
- Voyages expensive, impractical
- Foreign trade corrupting
- Resources needed for defense against Mongols
- Seafaring un-Confucian

### Haijin (Sea Ban)

Private maritime trade increasingly restricted. Imperial navy dismantled.

### Records Destroyed

Hostile officials may have destroyed voyage records to prevent future expeditions.

## Historical Significance

### "What If?"

Had China continued maritime expansion:
- Might have colonized Africa, Americas
- World history dramatically different
- European Age of Exploration might not have dominated

### Chinese Assessment

For centuries, voyages minimized. Now celebrated as proof of Chinese achievements and "peaceful rise."

### Comparison to Europe

Columbus sailed 1492—60 years after Zheng He's final voyage. China had retreated from seas; Europe was just beginning.

## Legacy

### Modern China

- Zheng He celebrated as national hero
- Symbol of Chinese soft power
- Claimed as precedent for "peaceful" maritime expansion
- Belt and Road Initiative invokes his memory

### Memory

- Temples built in Southeast Asia (still active)
