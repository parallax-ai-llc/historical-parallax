## Summary

Zheng He (1371-1433) was a Chinese admiral, explorer, and diplomat who commanded massive naval expeditions throughout the Indian Ocean (1405-1433) under Ming Emperor Yongle. His fleet, the largest in the world at the time—with ships dwarfing European vessels—visited Southeast Asia, India, Arabia, and East Africa. The voyages demonstrated Chinese naval superiority, established tributary relationships, and facilitated trade, but were discontinued after Zheng He's death as China turned inward. Had China continued these expeditions, world history might have unfolded very differently.

## Why They Stopped

After Zheng He's death (1433) and Emperor Yongle's earlier passing, Confucian officials convinced the court that expeditions were wasteful. China turned focus inward, dismantled navy, even destroyed records of voyages. This isolationism allowed Europeans to dominate sea routes decades later.
