## Summary

Mohammad Hatta was Indonesia's first Vice President and a founding father of the Indonesian nation, serving alongside President Sukarno from 1945 to 1956. Born in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, he was an intellectual, economist, and nationalist leader who played a crucial role in Indonesia's independence movement against Dutch colonial rule. Known as "The Proclamator" alongside Sukarno, Hatta co-signed Indonesia's Declaration of Independence on August 17, 1945, marking the birth of the Indonesian Republic. Unlike many post-colonial leaders, Hatta voluntarily resigned from power in 1956 due to political differences with Sukarno, establishing a reputation for integrity and democratic principles. His legacy as "Bung Hatta" (Brother Hatta) remains deeply respected in Indonesia as a symbol of intellectual leadership, economic nationalism, and principled governance.

## Early Life and Background

Mohammad Hatta was born on August 12, 1902, in Bukittinggi (then called Fort de Kock), West Sumatra, in the Dutch East Indies. He came from a Minangkabau family, an ethnic group known for its matrilineal society and strong Islamic traditions. His father, Mohammad Djamil, was a merchant who died when Hatta was only eight months old, leaving him to be raised by his mother, Siti Saleha, and extended family members. The Minangkabau tradition of merantau (voluntary migration for education and advancement) would profoundly influence Hatta's worldview and intellectual development.

Hatta received his early education at the European Lower School (ELS) in Bukittinggi, where he excelled academically. He then attended MULO (Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs), a Dutch-language secondary school in Padang, demonstrating exceptional aptitude in mathematics and economics. His upbringing in the culturally rich Minangkabau society, combined with Dutch colonial education, created a unique intellectual foundation that blended indigenous values with Western knowledge.

In 1921, at age 19, Hatta traveled to Java to attend the Prins Hendrik School (now the Bandung Institute of Technology) in Batavia (Jakarta), a prestigious Dutch-language commercial school. However, his education in the Netherlands Indies proved to be just a stepping stone. In 1921, he was awarded a scholarship to study in the Netherlands, joining a growing community of Indonesian students who would become the intellectual vanguard of the independence movement. This period marked the beginning of his transformation from a talented student into a nationalist leader.

Hatta's time in the Netherlands, from 1921 to 1932, was formative in developing his political consciousness. He enrolled at the Rotterdam School of Commerce (Nederlandsche Handels-Hoogeschool), studying economics and later earning his doctorate. During these years, he became actively involved in the Perhimpunan Indonesia (Indonesian Association), a student organization that evolved from a cultural society into a radical nationalist movement. Hatta's intellectual rigor, combined with his exposure to European socialist and nationalist movements, shaped his vision for an independent Indonesia based on economic justice and democratic governance.

## Rise to Power

Hatta's rise to prominence began during his student years in the Netherlands, where he emerged as a leading voice of Indonesian nationalism. In 1922, he joined the Perhimpunan Indonesia and quickly became one of its most influential members. By 1926, he was elected chairman of the organization, transforming it into a platform for anti-colonial resistance. Under his leadership, the organization's magazine, "Indonesia Merdeka" (Free Indonesia), became increasingly radical, advocating for complete independence rather than reform within the colonial system.

In 1927, Hatta and several colleagues were arrested by Dutch authorities and tried in The Hague for seditious activities. The trial, rather than silencing him, provided Hatta with an international platform to articulate the case for Indonesian independence. His eloquent defense speech, which critiqued colonialism and articulated the Indonesian people's right to self-determination, gained widespread attention. He was ultimately acquitted, but the trial elevated his status as a nationalist leader both in Europe and back in the Dutch East Indies.

After completing his studies in 1932, Hatta returned to Indonesia, where he immediately joined forces with Sutan Sjahrir and other nationalist leaders. He became active in the Pendidikan Nasional Indonesia (Indonesian National Education) club, which focused on mass education and political consciousness-raising. However, his activities attracted colonial surveillance, and in 1934, both Hatta and Sjahrir were arrested by the Dutch authorities and exiled to Boven Digoel, a remote prison camp in New Guinea known for its harsh conditions.

Hatta spent nearly eight years in exile, first in Boven Digoel (1935-1936) and then in Banda Neira (1936-1942), a small island in the Moluccas. Despite the isolation, he continued his intellectual pursuits, reading extensively and corresponding with fellow nationalists. His exile, rather than breaking his spirit, strengthened his resolve and enhanced his reputation as a committed independence leader. The Japanese occupation of Indonesia in 1942 ended his exile, and he was brought back to Java along with other nationalist leaders.

During the Japanese occupation (1942-1945), Hatta, like Sukarno, chose a controversial path of cooperation with the Japanese authorities. Both leaders believed that working with the Japanese provided an opportunity to prepare Indonesia for eventual independence. Hatta served in various advisory capacities and was instrumental in organizing the Pembela Tanah Air (PETA), a Japanese-sponsored Indonesian volunteer army that would later become crucial to the independence struggle. This period of collaboration would later attract criticism, but Hatta and Sukarno argued they were strategically positioning Indonesia for the post-war independence moment.

As World War II drew to a close in August 1945, Hatta and Sukarno seized the opportunity created by Japan's impending defeat. On August 17, 1945, they proclaimed Indonesia's independence at Sukarno's house at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur 56, Jakarta. Hatta co-signed the declaration alongside Sukarno, and the two became known as "The Proclamators" (Dwi-Tunggal, or "Inseparable Duo"). The following day, Hatta was appointed Vice President of the newly declared Republic of Indonesia, a position he would hold for the next eleven years through the turbulent revolutionary period and early years of independence.

## Major Achievements

Mohammad Hatta's most significant achievement was his role in securing Indonesian independence and establishing the foundations of the Indonesian state. As Vice President, he served as a counterbalance to Sukarno's charismatic but often impulsive leadership style. While Sukarno excelled at mass mobilization and revolutionary rhetoric, Hatta provided intellectual depth, administrative competence, and diplomatic skill. This complementary partnership was crucial during Indonesia's four-year war of independence against the Dutch (1945-1949), who attempted to reassert colonial control.

During the Indonesian National Revolution, Hatta played a critical diplomatic role. When the Dutch launched their first "police action" (military offensive) in July 1947, Hatta was instrumental in bringing the conflict to international attention at the United Nations. His diplomatic efforts, combined with military resistance led by Indonesian fighters, eventually forced the Dutch to negotiate. Hatta participated in key negotiations, including the Linggadjati Agreement (1946), the Renville Agreement (1948), and ultimately the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in The Hague (1949), which resulted in Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.

One of Hatta's most courageous moments came during the Madiun Affair of September 1948, when the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) attempted a coup in the city of Madiun. The revolt occurred at a critical moment when Indonesia was under intense military pressure from the Dutch. Hatta, serving as Prime Minister at the time (in addition to Vice President), supported decisive military action to suppress the communist rebellion, arguing that the revolution's survival required unity and that the PKI's actions threatened to fragment the independence movement. The firm response to the Madiun Affair demonstrated to Western powers that Indonesia's leadership was not communist, which proved crucial for gaining international support.

As an economist, Hatta made substantial contributions to Indonesia's economic policy framework. He was a strong advocate for cooperative economics, believing that cooperatives suited Indonesia's communal traditions and could provide a third way between capitalism and communism. His 1933 article on cooperative economics and his subsequent work on Indonesia's economic structure influenced Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution, which established that the economy should be based on family principles (asas kekeluargaan) with cooperatives playing a central role. To this day, Hatta is honored as "Bapak Koperasi" (Father of Cooperatives) in Indonesia, and Cooperatives Day is celebrated on his birthday, August 12.

Hatta also served as Prime Minister during two critical periods: from January to August 1948 and again from 1948 to 1950. During his tenure, he implemented important administrative and economic reforms while managing the ongoing revolutionary struggle. He worked to professionalize the Indonesian military, establish functioning government institutions, and create economic policies that could sustain the new nation. His emphasis on rational administration and institutional development provided crucial stability during a chaotic revolutionary period.

In foreign policy, Hatta articulated what became known as the "Hatta Doctrine" or "Independent and Active" (Bebas-Aktif) foreign policy. In a speech on September 2, 1948, he declared that Indonesia would not align with either the Western bloc or the Soviet bloc in the emerging Cold War, instead pursuing an independent foreign policy based on national interests. This doctrine became a cornerstone of Indonesian foreign policy and influenced the Non-Aligned Movement, which Indonesia co-founded at the Bandung Conference in 1955. Hatta's vision positioned Indonesia as a leader among newly independent nations seeking to navigate Cold War pressures while maintaining sovereignty.

Throughout his vice presidency, Hatta championed democratic governance and constitutional limits on executive power. He consistently argued for parliamentary democracy, regular elections, and the rule of law, often finding himself at odds with Sukarno's more authoritarian inclinations. He opposed Sukarno's concept of "Guided Democracy" (Demokrasi Terpimpin), which concentrated power in the presidency and limited political opposition. These principled positions, while sometimes putting him in conflict with Sukarno, established Hatta's reputation as a democrat committed to constitutional governance.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his respected legacy, Mohammad Hatta's career was not without controversy. The most significant criticism centers on his cooperation with the Japanese occupation forces from 1942 to 1945. Both Hatta and Sukarno accepted positions in Japanese-sponsored organizations and encouraged Indonesian cooperation with the occupation. Critics, both contemporary and historical, have argued that this collaboration amounted to betrayal, particularly given Japanese brutality, including forced labor (romusha) that resulted in thousands of Indonesian deaths, and the sexual enslavement of Indonesian women as "comfort women."

Hatta and his defenders argued that their cooperation was strategic—a calculated risk to prepare Indonesia organizationally and militarily for independence. They claimed that the Japanese, unlike the Dutch, were willing to train Indonesians in administration and military affairs, and that this training proved invaluable during the revolution. However, this justification has remained contentious. Some historians argue that Hatta and Sukarno could have resisted more actively or at least avoided legitimizing Japanese rule through their participation in occupation institutions. The moral complexity of this period has never been fully resolved in Indonesian historical discourse.

Another source of criticism was Hatta's handling of regional rebellions during the 1950s. The suppression of the Madiun Affair in 1948, while praised by anti-communists, was condemned by leftists who saw it as a betrayal of socialist principles. More significantly, during the 1950s, several regions launched rebellions against the central government, including the Darul Islam movement and later the PRRI/Permesta rebellion (1958-1961) in Sumatra and Sulawesi. Some of Hatta's fellow Sumatrans expected him to support their grievances against Java-dominated central government policies, but Hatta remained firmly committed to Indonesian unity, disappointing regional leaders who felt betrayed.

Hatta's economic policies also attracted criticism from multiple directions. Leftist critics argued that his cooperative economics and moderate approach failed to address fundamental inequalities and that more radical land reform and nationalization were necessary. Right-wing critics, conversely, felt that his socialism-influenced economics deterred foreign investment and hindered economic development. In practice, Indonesia's economy struggled significantly during the 1950s, suffering from inflation, infrastructure damage from the war, and limited capital. While these problems cannot be solely attributed to Hatta's economic philosophy, his policies did not produce the rapid development that some had hoped for.

His resignation from the vice presidency in 1956 was controversial in its timing and impact. Hatta cited fundamental political differences with Sukarno, particularly over the move toward Guided Democracy and the growing influence of the Communist Party. However, some critics argued that by resigning rather than fighting from within, Hatta abandoned his responsibilities and left Indonesia without an effective democratic counterweight to Sukarno's increasingly authoritarian tendencies. His resignation may have inadvertently paved the way for the political crises of the 1960s, including the 1965-66 massacres.

Some scholars have also criticized Hatta for not being more vocal in opposing Sukarno's authoritarian drift and the political violence of the 1950s and 1960s. After his resignation, Hatta generally maintained a dignified silence rather than publicly challenging Sukarno's policies. While this restraint reflected his constitutional principles and reluctance to destabilize the nation, critics argue that a figure of his stature had a moral obligation to speak out more forcefully against the erosion of democracy and the later mass killings following the 1965 coup attempt.

Finally, Hatta's technocratic and intellectual approach, while respected, sometimes put him out of touch with mass politics. Unlike Sukarno, who was a masterful orator and charismatic leader, Hatta's style was more reserved and academic. Some critics argue that his inability or unwillingness to engage in populist politics meant he could not effectively mobilize support for his democratic vision, ultimately allowing more authoritarian forces to dominate Indonesian politics.

## Personal Life

Mohammad Hatta married Rahmi Rachim on November 18, 1945, just three months after Indonesia's independence declaration. Rahmi, who came from a respectable Betawi family in Jakarta, was considerably younger than Hatta, who was 43 at the time of their marriage. Their marriage was reportedly arranged by mutual acquaintances, following traditional Indonesian customs. Despite the significant age difference and the arranged nature of the marriage, by most accounts, they developed a strong and affectionate partnership that lasted until Hatta's death in 1980.

The couple had three daughters: Meutia Farida Hatta (known as Gemala), Halida Nuriah Hatta, and Ratu Atria Siti Hatta. Hatta was known to be a devoted father who valued his family life highly. Despite his demanding political responsibilities, he made efforts to spend time with his daughters and took interest in their education. His daughter Meutia Farida Hatta would later become a prominent economist and academic, serving as a member of Indonesia's Constitutional Court, carrying on her father's legacy of public service and intellectual rigor.

Hatta was known for his austere lifestyle and personal integrity. Unlike many political leaders, he did not accumulate personal wealth or engage in corruption. When he resigned as Vice President in 1956, he had few financial resources and struggled to maintain his household. He lived in a modest home in Jakarta and relied on his pension and occasional writing fees for income. This financial modesty, while reflecting his integrity, also caused hardship for his family, particularly after his retirement from politics.

In personality, Hatta was described as reserved, intellectual, and methodical—a stark contrast to Sukarno's flamboyant charisma. He was an avid reader with a personal library containing thousands of books on economics, history, and political theory. He wrote extensively, producing numerous essays, articles, and books on Indonesian economics, cooperatives, and political development. His intellectual approach to politics was both a strength and a limitation: it gave him analytical clarity but sometimes distanced him from emotional connections with the masses.

Hatta's health declined significantly in the 1970s. He suffered from heart problems and other ailments related to aging and the hardships he had endured during his years of exile. Despite his declining health, he remained intellectually active, continuing to write and occasionally commenting on Indonesian political affairs. He was particularly concerned about corruption and the erosion of democratic principles under Suharto's New Order regime, though he was careful in his criticisms.

Mohammad Hatta died on March 14, 1980, at the age of 77, at his home in Jakarta. His death was met with national mourning, and he was given a state funeral attended by thousands. President Suharto, despite political differences, paid tribute to Hatta's contributions to Indonesian independence and development. Hatta was buried at Tanah Kusir Public Cemetery in Jakarta, where many Indonesian national heroes are interred. His funeral demonstrated the deep respect Indonesians held for him, transcending political divisions.

One of the most telling aspects of Hatta's personal character was his relationship with money and power. There are numerous anecdotes about his refusal to accept gifts or special treatment, his insistence on paying his own way, and his rejection of opportunities to enrich himself through political connections. When the government later recognized his financial difficulties and increased his pension, he reportedly used much of the additional income to support educational and social causes rather than improving his own living conditions. This personal incorruptibility became a defining element of his legacy and a standard by which subsequent Indonesian leaders would be measured.

## Legacy

Mohammad Hatta's legacy in Indonesia is profound and multifaceted. He is universally recognized as one of the nation's founding fathers, honored as a Proclamator of Independence and National Hero. The respect for "Bung Hatta" crosses political and ideological lines, with both democratic and authoritarian regimes, both Islamic and secular groups, claiming him as part of their heritage. This broad respect reflects both his actual accomplishments and his symbolic value as a figure of integrity in Indonesian political culture.

Hatta's most enduring legacy is in economic thought and policy. His advocacy for cooperative economics shaped Indonesia's constitutional economic framework and inspired generations of Indonesian economists and policymakers. The principle enshrined in Article 33 of the 1945 Constitution—that the economy should be organized cooperatively and serve the people's welfare—reflects Hatta's intellectual influence. Although the practical implementation of cooperative economics has been inconsistent and often disappointing, the ideal remains central to Indonesian economic discourse. Cooperatives Day, celebrated annually on Hatta's birthday (August 12), institutionalizes his legacy in this field.

The concept of "Independent and Active" foreign policy remains a cornerstone of Indonesian international relations. Hatta's articulation of non-alignment and Indonesia's refusal to choose sides in the Cold War influenced not just Indonesia but the broader Non-Aligned Movement. This doctrine has shown remarkable resilience, surviving multiple regime changes and continuing to guide Indonesian foreign policy in the 21st century. Indonesia's contemporary role as a bridge between different international groupings—engaging with both Western democracies and Asian powers, participating in ASEAN while maintaining global partnerships—reflects the principles Hatta articulated in 1948.

Hatta's commitment to democratic governance and constitutional limits on power provides an important counternarrative to Indonesia's authoritarian periods. During Suharto's New Order regime (1966-1998), when Sukarno's legacy was tarnished by association with political chaos and communist sympathies, Hatta's reputation remained largely untarnished. Democratic activists and reformers could point to Hatta as an example of principled leadership, constitutional governance, and voluntary relinquishment of power. After Indonesia's democratic transition beginning in 1998, Hatta's legacy gained renewed relevance as a model for democratic leadership.

Educational institutions throughout Indonesia bear Hatta's name, including Mohammad Hatta University in Padang and numerous schools across the archipelago. These institutions serve as daily reminders of his contributions and help transmit his values to new generations. His childhood home in Bukittinggi has been converted into a museum, preserving artifacts from his life and serving as a pilgrimage site for those interested in Indonesian history. The Indonesian currency has featured Hatta's image alongside Sukarno on the 100,000 rupiah note, literally inscribing his face into daily economic life.

In academic discourse, Hatta's writings on economics, democracy, and Indonesian identity remain subjects of study and debate. His synthesis of Islamic values, Minangkabau traditions, European socialist thought, and Indonesian nationalism created a distinctive intellectual framework that continues to influence Indonesian political thought. Scholars study Hatta not just as a historical figure but as a thinker whose ideas remain relevant to contemporary challenges of democracy, economic justice, and cultural identity in developing nations.

Perhaps Hatta's most important legacy is symbolic: he represents the possibility of principled leadership in Indonesian politics. In a political culture often characterized by patronage, corruption, and authoritarianism, Hatta's life story—his incorruptibility, his voluntary resignation from power, his commitment to democratic principles, his modest lifestyle—provides an idealized standard. Whether or not subsequent leaders live up to this standard, Hatta's example creates a measuring stick by which Indonesian leaders are judged. The question "What would Bung Hatta do?" remains a rhetorical device in Indonesian political discourse.

Hatta's relationship with Sukarno has become a defining narrative of Indonesian national identity—the idea that the nation's founding required both revolutionary passion (Sukarno) and rational governance (Hatta), both charismatic mass leadership and intellectual discipline. This Dwi-Tunggal (inseparable duo) concept, while perhaps overly romanticized, captures an important truth about successful nation-building requiring diverse forms of leadership. The eventual breakdown of their partnership is often narrated as a tragedy, a failure to maintain the balance that made independence possible.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and political scientists generally regard Mohammad Hatta as one of Indonesia's most admirable founding fathers. Herbert Feith, an influential scholar of Indonesian politics, characterized Hatta as representing the "administrators" faction of Indonesian nationalism—those who emphasized rational governance, institution-building, and technocratic competence, in contrast to the "solidarity makers" like Sukarno who emphasized mass mobilization and ideological unity. Feith's framework, while sometimes oversimplified, captures Hatta's distinctive contribution to Indonesian state-building.

Prominent Indonesian historians such as Anhar Gonggong and Bonnie Triyana have praised Hatta's intellectual rigor and his role in articulating a coherent vision for Indonesian independence that went beyond mere anti-colonialism. Hatta's writings from the 1920s and 1930s, they argue, provided the ideological foundation for Indonesian nationalism, connecting local traditions with universal principles of self-determination and economic justice. His educational background and international experience enabled him to articulate Indonesia's case in terms that resonated with international audiences, crucial for gaining diplomatic recognition.

Economists and development scholars frequently cite Hatta's cooperative economics as an innovative attempt to create an alternative to both capitalism and communism. Mubyarto, a prominent Indonesian economist, argued that Hatta's "Pancasila Economics" (referring to Indonesia's state philosophy) represented a genuinely Indonesian approach to economic development that, if properly implemented, could have avoided many of the problems that plagued both capitalist and socialist developing countries. While acknowledging that cooperative economics has not fulfilled its promise in practice, admirers argue that this reflects implementation failures rather than flaws in Hatta's vision.

International observers have consistently praised Hatta's democratic commitments. George McTurnan Kahin, an American scholar who witnessed Indonesia's revolution firsthand, wrote admiringly of Hatta's constitutional principles and his efforts to restrain Sukarno's authoritarian tendencies. Kahin and others have argued that Indonesian democracy might have developed more successfully if Hatta's vision had prevailed over Sukarno's Guided Democracy. His voluntary resignation from power is frequently compared favorably to the behavior of many post-colonial leaders who clung to power indefinitely.

Religious scholars, particularly Islamic intellectuals, have praised Hatta's synthesis of Islamic values with democratic governance and social justice. Unlike some secular nationalists who viewed Islam as obstacle to modernization, and unlike Islamic fundamentalists who rejected democratic institutions, Hatta articulated a vision in which Islamic ethical principles informed progressive politics without imposing theocratic governance. Nurcholish Madjid and other prominent Indonesian Islamic thinkers have cited Hatta as a model of how Muslims can engage constructively with modernity and democracy while remaining rooted in religious values.

Hatta's supporters emphasize his personal integrity as perhaps his greatest contribution to Indonesian political culture. In a region where post-colonial leaders often enriched themselves and their families through corruption, Hatta's modest lifestyle and financial difficulties after leaving office stand as remarkable exceptions. Biographers such as Deliar Noer have documented numerous examples of Hatta refusing gifts, insisting on paying his own expenses, and living simply despite his high office. This personal example, admirers argue, established a standard of public service that, even if rarely matched, remains an ideal in Indonesian political discourse.

Contemporary democratic activists and reformers in Indonesia frequently invoke Hatta's legacy when critiquing corruption and authoritarianism. During the Reformasi period following Suharto's fall in 1998, Hatta's writings on democracy and his example of voluntary power transfer were widely cited by those advocating for democratic reforms. Organizations promoting transparency and anti-corruption frequently use Hatta's image and quotes in their campaigns, leveraging his respected legacy to promote good governance.

## Negative Views

Despite widespread respect for Mohammad Hatta, critical historians and political scientists have identified significant limitations and contradictions in his legacy. The most substantial criticism concerns his collaboration with Japanese occupation forces from 1942-1945. Indonesian leftist historians and some international scholars have argued that Hatta's cooperation with the Japanese constituted a betrayal of the Indonesian people, particularly those subjected to forced labor and sexual exploitation. Critics note that Hatta and Sukarno's participation in Japanese-sponsored organizations legitimized the occupation and facilitated Japanese exploitation of Indonesian resources and labor for their war effort.

J.D. Legge and other historians have questioned the strategic justification for collaboration, arguing that the organizational and military training benefits were outweighed by the moral costs and that Indonesian nationalism might have developed more authentically through resistance rather than collaboration. These critics point out that in other occupied territories, resistance movements—despite tremendous costs—preserved moral authority that served post-war nation-building. By choosing cooperation, Hatta and Sukarno compromised their moral position and created a legacy that has complicated Indonesia's relationship with World War II history.

Leftist critics have accused Hatta of betraying socialist principles, particularly in his role in suppressing the 1948 Madiun communist rebellion. Indonesian communists and their sympathizers view Hatta's decisive military response to the PKI uprising as a betrayal of the revolutionary left and an alignment with Western capitalist interests. Some historians argue that Hatta's anti-communism reflected his Western education and Cold War pressures more than genuine Indonesian political development, and that his suppression of the left contributed to Indonesia's subsequent political polarization.

Hatta's economic policies have been criticized as ineffective by both left and right. Market-oriented economists argue that his emphasis on cooperatives and state enterprise hindered Indonesia's economic development by discouraging private investment, foreign capital, and entrepreneurship. Statistics from the 1950s show Indonesia's economy struggling with high inflation, low growth, and declining per capita income—problems that critics partly attribute to the economic framework Hatta helped establish. Conversely, leftist economists argue that Hatta's "middle way" approach failed to address fundamental inequalities and that his reluctance to pursue radical land reform and nationalization perpetuated colonial-era economic structures.

Some historians have criticized Hatta's resignation in 1956 as an act of political cowardice or at least poor judgment. By withdrawing from active politics rather than fighting Sukarno's authoritarian drift, critics argue, Hatta abandoned his responsibilities and left Indonesia without an effective democratic voice. Hamish McDonald and other biographers have suggested that Hatta's personality—reserved, intellectual, uncomfortable with political struggle—made him unsuited to the rough-and-tumble of post-independence politics. His preference for principled withdrawal over messy political combat, while personally admirable, may have been politically irresponsible.

Regional critics, particularly from outer islands like Sumatra and Sulawesi, have accused Hatta of betraying regional interests in favor of Java-centric nationalism. Despite being Sumatran himself and despite having articulated concerns about Java's domination of the archipelago, Hatta consistently opposed regional rebellions and supported strong central government authority. During the PRRI/Permesta rebellion (1958-1961), when many Sumatrans expected Hatta to support their grievances against Jakarta, he remained committed to Indonesian unity, disappointing those who felt that centralization was recreating Dutch colonial patterns of exploitation.

Some scholars have argued that Hatta's intellectual and technocratic approach was fundamentally elitist and disconnected from the masses of Indonesian people. Unlike Sukarno, who could mobilize millions through emotional rhetoric and symbolic politics, Hatta's reasoned arguments and economic theories meant little to illiterate peasants and urban poor. Critics suggest that his cooperative economics, while theoretically appealing, failed to resonate with actual Indonesian economic actors, who preferred either traditional economic relationships or modern market opportunities. His inability to translate ideas into popular movements limited his political effectiveness.

Feminist scholars have noted Hatta's generally conservative views on gender and his failure to champion women's rights more vigorously. While he was not actively opposed to women's participation in public life, and while Indonesia's independence period saw some women leaders emerge, Hatta did not prioritize gender equality in his political agenda. His economic theories and political writings rarely addressed women's economic roles or rights, reflecting the male-dominated perspective of his generation's nationalism.

Finally, some critics argue that Hatta's legacy has been sanitized and romanticized to serve various political agendas. The "Saint Hatta" narrative—emphasizing his incorruptibility and democratic principles while downplaying his compromises and failures—serves as a convenient myth for those critiquing contemporary corruption without necessarily offering realistic political alternatives. These critics suggest that a more honest assessment of Hatta would acknowledge his contradictions, his collaboration with authoritarians (both Japanese occupiers and Sukarno), and his limited effectiveness in implementing his ideals.
