## Summary

Okada Mokichi was the founder of Sekai Kyusei Kyo (the Church of World Messianity), a Japanese new religion emphasizing spiritual healing through Johrei (purification of the spirit). He was also a passionate advocate of natural farming and a major art collector who established the MOA Museum of Art. His three pillars of paradise — art, natural farming, and Johrei — constitute a comprehensive vision of civilization renewal.
