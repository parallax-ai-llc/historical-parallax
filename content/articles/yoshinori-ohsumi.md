## Summary

Yoshinori Ohsumi is a Japanese cell biologist who won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discoveries of mechanisms for autophagy, the process by which cells recycle their own components. His work using yeast cells identified the genes essential for autophagy and elucidated the molecular machinery involved. Understanding autophagy has implications for cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and aging.
