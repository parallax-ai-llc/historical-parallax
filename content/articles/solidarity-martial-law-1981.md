## Summary

Solidarity (Solidarność) was the first independent trade union in a Soviet-bloc country, born in the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, Poland, in August 1980. Led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, it grew within months to encompass 10 million members—one-third of Poland's working-age population—becoming far more than a labor union: it was a mass social movement demanding fundamental change in a communist society. Solidarity represented the most serious challenge to Soviet control in Eastern Europe since the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.[^1]

On December 13, 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law, crushing Solidarity's open activities. Tanks rolled through Polish cities; Wałęsa and thousands of activists were arrested; strikes were broken by force. At the Wujek Coal Mine, ZOMO riot police killed nine miners—the bloodiest incident of martial law. Over the next two years, approximately 90 people died and 10,000 were interned without trial.[^2]

But Solidarity was not destroyed. It continued underground, supported by the Catholic Church, Western governments, and millions of ordinary Poles. In 1989, faced with economic collapse, the communist government agreed to roundtable talks. Solidarity was re-legalized, won a landslide election victory, and formed Poland's first non-communist government since World War II. The fall of communism in Poland triggered the revolutions of 1989 across Eastern Europe. Lech Wałęsa became Poland's first democratically elected president in 1990.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Communist Poland

Poland came under Soviet domination after World War II. The Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) ruled as a one-party state aligned with Moscow. Key features included:

- Centrally planned economy
- Suppression of independent civil society
- Catholic Church as partial refuge from state control
- Periodic crises and worker protests (1956, 1970, 1976)[^4]

### Previous Worker Protests

Polish workers had risen before:
- **1956 (Poznań):** Strikes met with military force; dozens killed
- **1970 (Baltic Coast):** Shipyard strikes triggered by price hikes; approximately 45 killed
- **1976 (Radom/Ursus):** Strikes brutally suppressed; formation of KOR (Workers' Defense Committee)

These experiences shaped the workers who would form Solidarity.[^5]

### Economic Crisis (Late 1970s)

By the late 1970s, Poland faced severe economic problems:
- Mounting foreign debt
- Food shortages and rationing
- Price increases that hit workers hardest
- Growing gap between official promises and daily reality[^6]

---

## The Birth of Solidarity

### July-August 1980: The Strikes Begin

In July 1980, the government announced major price increases. Strikes spread across Poland:

- Lublin, Łódź, and other industrial centers struck
- The regime made concessions, but protests continued

### The Lenin Shipyard (August 1980)

On August 14, 1980, workers at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk went on strike. The immediate cause was the dismissal of Anna Walentynowicz, a popular crane operator and activist.

**Lech Wałęsa's arrival:**
- Wałęsa, a fired electrician and veteran activist, climbed over the shipyard fence
- He addressed the workers and emerged as the strike leader
- An Interfactory Strike Committee (MKS) was formed, coordinating with other enterprises[^7]

### The 21 Demands

The strikers issued 21 demands, including:

1. Independent, self-governing trade unions
2. Right to strike
3. Freedom of speech, press, and publication
4. Release of political prisoners
5. Access to media for all religious denominations
6. Selection of management based on qualifications, not party membership

These demands went far beyond economic grievances—they challenged the foundations of the communist system.[^8]

### The Gdańsk Agreement (August 31, 1980)

After two weeks of negotiations, Deputy Prime Minister Mieczysław Jagielski signed an agreement with Wałęsa:

- Workers won the right to form independent trade unions
- Right to strike recognized
- Concessions on censorship and religious access to media
- First time a communist government had conceded such rights

Solidarity was officially registered in November 1980.[^9]

---

## The Sixteen Months (September 1980 - December 1981)

### Explosive Growth

Solidarity grew with unprecedented speed:
- By early 1981: 10 million members
- Nearly one-third of Poland's working-age population
- Organized in virtually every workplace

The union was a broad social movement embracing workers, intellectuals, students, and farmers (with the allied Rural Solidarity).[^10]

### Tension with the Regime

The PZPR faced impossible pressure:
- Could not tolerate independent organization that challenged its monopoly
- Could not suppress Solidarity without risking mass resistance and Western condemnation
- Soviet Union demanded action

Throughout 1981, tensions escalated through strikes, confrontations, and negotiations. Key figures like Wałęsa, intellectual advisors (Bronisław Geremek, Tadeusz Mazowiecki), and church leaders (Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, then Cardinal Józef Glemp) navigated between confrontation and compromise.[^11]

### The Soviet Factor

Moscow watched with alarm:
- Solidarity threatened the entire Soviet bloc
- Warsaw Pact exercises signaled possible intervention
- The Polish leadership faced the choice: suppress the movement themselves or face Soviet invasion[^12]

---

## Martial Law

### December 13, 1981

In the early hours of December 13, 1981, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, who was both Prime Minister and First Secretary of the PZPR, declared martial law (stan wojenny):

**Immediate measures:**
- Tanks and soldiers deployed to major cities
- Phones cut; borders sealed
- Curfew imposed
- Solidarity leaders arrested (including Wałęsa, detained until November 1982)
- Approximately 5,000-10,000 people interned in the first weeks[^13]

### Justification

Jaruzelski claimed martial law was necessary to:
- Prevent economic collapse
- Forestall Soviet invasion
- Preserve national stability

He framed it as the "lesser evil." This justification remains contested—critics argue the Soviets were unlikely to invade by late 1981.[^14]

### Resistance and Repression

Solidarity did not surrender quietly:

**Wujek Mine Massacre (December 16, 1981):**
The bloodiest incident occurred at Wujek Coal Mine in Katowice:
- Miners barricaded themselves and refused to end their strike
- ZOMO riot police and soldiers stormed the mine
- Nine miners were shot dead; dozens wounded
- The massacre became a symbol of regime brutality[^15]

**Other resistance:**
- Strikes at shipyards, mines, and factories were broken by force
- Some factories held out for days
- Underground resistance networks formed
- Samizdat (underground) publications circulated[^16]

---

## Death Toll and Casualties

**Parliamentary Commission findings (1989-1991):**
- Over 90 people killed during martial law period

**Other estimates:**
- Approximately 100 killed
- 10,000+ interned in ~50-67 camps
- Thousands arrested, tried, sentenced
- Unknown numbers beaten and injured[^17]

## Historical Assessment

### Pro-Solidarity Perspective

**Heroic Resistance:** Solidarity was the most significant challenge to Soviet communism, demonstrating that workers themselves rejected the system that claimed to rule in their name. The union's combination of mass participation, nonviolent discipline, and moral authority made it a model for democratic resistance.[^18]

**Beginning of the End:** Martial law delayed but could not prevent communism's collapse. Solidarity's survival underground and resurgence in 1989 proved that the regime could not destroy civil society. Poland's breakthrough enabled the fall of the Berlin Wall and the revolutions of 1989.[^19]

### Jaruzelski's Defense

**Lesser Evil:** Jaruzelski argued that martial law prevented Soviet invasion and preserved Polish statehood. Without his action, he claimed, the alternative would have been Warsaw Pact occupation and far greater bloodshed.

This argument remains controversial. Evidence suggests the Soviets were reluctant to invade by late 1981, though the threat was real earlier in the crisis.[^20]

### Critical Analysis

**Incomplete Victory?** Some argue that the 1989 transition was a negotiated compromise that allowed former communists to transform into new elites. Economic "shock therapy" benefited some while hurting workers Solidarity once represented. The union's political role declined after initial democratization.[^21]

## Legacy and Long-term Impact

### Underground Solidarity (1982-1989)

Despite martial law:
- Underground structures maintained
- Samizdat publications flourished
- Church provided sanctuary
- Western support (especially from US/Reagan administration and Pope John Paul II) sustained morale
- Economic failure continued to delegitimize the regime[^22]

### The Roundtable and Democratic Transition (1989)

In early 1989, the regime opened roundtable negotiations:
- Solidarity re-legalized April 1989
- Semi-free elections June 1989: Solidarity won overwhelming victory
- Mazowiecki became first non-communist PM (August 1989)
- Wałęsa elected President (December 1990)[^23]

### Domino Effect

Poland's breakthrough inspired the fall of communism across Eastern Europe:
- Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania followed in 1989
- Soviet Union collapsed in 1991

### Commemoration

- August 31 (anniversary of Gdańsk Agreement) is observed
- European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk preserves history
- Wujek miners commemorated as martyrs
- Martial law anniversary (December 13) marked with reflection[^24]
