## Summary

Apollonius of Perga was an ancient Greek mathematician known as 'The Great Geometer.' His treatise 'Conics' defined and systematized the study of conic sections (ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas). These curves later proved fundamental in physics — Kepler used ellipses for planetary orbits and Galileo used parabolas for projectile motion. His work influenced mathematics for over 2,000 years.
