## Summary

Girolamo Fracastoro proposed an early form of germ theory in his 1546 work De Contagione, suggesting that epidemic diseases are caused by transferable tiny particles (seminaria). He coined the term 'syphilis' in his 1530 poem Syphilis, sive Morbus Gallicus. His ideas about contagion anticipated modern microbiology by three centuries.
