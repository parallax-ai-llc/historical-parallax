## Summary

The Tunguska Event is the largest impact event on Earth in recorded history. On the morning of June 30, 1908, a massive explosion flattened 2,000 square kilometers (about 830 sq miles) of Siberian taiga forest. The blast is estimated to have been **1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb** (10-15 megatons).

What makes Tunguska so mysterious and fertile ground for theories is the **lack of an impact crater**. The object—whatever it was—exploded in the air (airburst) with such force that it knocked trees flat in a radial pattern like matchsticks but left no significant hole in the ground. While modern science favors a meteor or comet, fringe theories range from a miniature black hole to the crash of an alien nuclear-powered spacecraft.[^1]

## The Event (June 30, 1908)

### The Blast (7:17 AM Local Time)
Eyewitnesses in trading posts 40 miles away saw a bluish light, nearly as bright as the sun, moving across the sky.
*   **The Sound:** A column of fire was followed by a shockwave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometers away.
*   **The Shockwave:** Detailed seismic stations across Eurasia recorded the tremors. Atmospheric pressure waves were detected as far away as Great Britain.
*   **The Sky:** For days afterward, the night skies over Europe and Asia were glowing so brightly that people could read newspapers at midnight (likely due to high-altitude dust/ice dispersion).[^2]

### The Investigation (1927)
Due to the remoteness and political turmoil (Russian Revolution), the first scientific expedition didn't arrive until 19 years later, led by mineralogist **Leonid Kulik**.
*   **The Scene:** Kulik expected to find a huge crater with a meteorite in the middle. Instead, he found a vast area of toppled trees.
*   **The Butterfly Pattern:** The trees lay in a radial pattern pointing away from a central epicenter. At the very center ("Ground Zero"), the trees were still standing but stripped of all branches and bark ("telephone poles"). This indicated the explosion happened directly above them.[^3]

## Explanations

### Scientific Consensus: Meteor/Comet Airburst
The prevailing theory is that a stony asteroid or a comet nucleus (approx. 50-100 meters wide) entered the atmosphere and exploded at an altitude of 5-10 km due to extreme pressure/heat.
*   **Chelyabinsk (2013):** The 2013 meteor over Russia provided a smaller-scale modern example of how airbursts work.

### The UFO Hypothesis (Kazantsev)
In 1946, Soviet sci-fi writer **Alexander Kazantsev** wrote a story titled "Explosion," proposing the event was the nuclear explosion of a Martian spacecraft.
*   **Nuclear Parallels:** Kazantsev pointed out similarities between the devastation at Tunguska and Hiroshima (standing trees at ground zero, radiation burns on witnesses).
*   **The Argument:** Since no meteorite fragments were found for decades, he argued the object must have vaporized completely—like an optimized nuclear drive.[^4]

### Other Exotic Theories
*   **Miniature Black Hole:** In 1973, physicists Jackson and Ryan proposed a primordial micro-black hole passed through Earth. (Disproven as there was no exit event on the other side of the planet).
*   **Antimatter:** An impact by a chunk of antimatter would explain the pure energy release and lack of residue, though no mechanism for its existence in our solar system exists.[^5]
