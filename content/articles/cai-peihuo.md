## Summary

Cai Peihuo (蔡培火, 1889-1983), also romanized as Tsai Pei-huo, was a pioneering Taiwanese social activist, educator, and politician who played a central role in Taiwan's anti-colonial movements during Japanese rule (1895-1945). Born in Beigang, Yunlin County, he became one of the key leaders advocating for Taiwanese autonomy and cultural preservation through peaceful political means.[^1] Cai is particularly remembered for his work in language reform, his 1928 manifesto addressing Japanese discrimination, and his leadership in founding Taiwan's first political party.[^2] His career spanned both the Japanese colonial period and the post-war Kuomintang era, making him one of the most controversial yet influential figures in modern Taiwanese history.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Cai Peihuo was born on May 22, 1889, in Beigang, a small town in Yunlin County in central Taiwan, during the final years of Qing Dynasty rule.[^4] His father was a well-known local scholar, providing Cai with a privileged intellectual upbringing.[^5] However, the family's fortunes changed dramatically following Japan's colonization of Taiwan in 1895. Because Cai and his elder brother participated in anti-Japanese resistance activities, the entire family was forced to flee to Shimen, Fujian Province on the Chinese mainland.[^6] The exile depleted the family's assets, and they eventually returned to Beigang under difficult economic circumstances.

Despite these hardships, Cai received a strong education. From 1897, he studied classical Chinese literature under the tutelage of his eldest brother, Cai Jia Pei.[^7] During 1901-1902, while attending public school, his brother who was studying in Tainan introduced him to romanization systems for Chinese characters.[^8] This early exposure to romanized script would profoundly influence Cai's later advocacy for language reform and literacy campaigns. At age 13, Cai converted to Christianity, joining the Presbyterian Church, which connected him to networks of Western-educated reformers and missionaries working in Taiwan.[^9]

Cai initially worked as a schoolteacher in Taiwan, but his involvement in political activism soon cost him his position. After joining the Taiwan Assimilation Society (Taiwan Dōkakai) in 1914, Cai was forced to leave his teaching job when the organization was dissolved by Japanese authorities in 1915.[^10] The Taiwan Assimilation Society, briefly led by Japanese politician Itagaki Taisuke, had attracted over 3,000 Taiwanese and Japanese members who sought equal treatment for Taiwan within the Japanese Empire.[^11] Following the society's suppression, Cai's friend and patron Lin Hsien-tang, a wealthy landowner from the influential Wufeng Lin family, provided financial support for Cai to pursue higher education in Japan.[^12]

In 1915, Cai traveled to Tokyo to study physics and chemistry at Tokyo Higher Normal School (now the University of Tsukuba).[^13] This education abroad exposed him to liberal political thought, modern science, and the growing movement of Taiwanese students organizing for reform. It was in Tokyo that Cai would help establish the foundations of Taiwan's modern political activism.

## Rise to Power

Cai Peihuo's political ascent began during his years as a student in Tokyo, where he became part of a network of Taiwanese intellectuals organizing against colonial discrimination. On July 16, 1920, Cai and other Taiwanese students in Tokyo launched *Taiwan Youth* (台灣青年, Tai Oan Chheng Lian), a groundbreaking political magazine that would become the voice of Taiwan's emerging anti-colonial movement.[^14] Cai served as editor-in-chief and primary spokesperson for the publication.[^15] The magazine's mission statement declared: "Collecting domestic and overseas ideas and writing in Japanese and Chinese, we hope to respond to global events and follow modern trends to advance the wisdom of Taiwanese."[^16]

Through *Taiwan Youth*, Cai articulated sophisticated arguments for reform within the colonial system. In the magazine's fourth issue, he elaborated on Taiwan's political status, arguing that the government must treat Japanese settlers, ethnic Chinese Taiwanese, and indigenous peoples equally.[^17] This position reflected Cai's moderate approach: rather than calling for independence, he sought to leverage Japanese liberal ideals to secure greater rights for Taiwan.

In 1921, Cai became involved in the Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament, which would become the longest-lasting political campaign during Japanese colonial rule.[^18] Starting from January 30, 1921, when the first petition was submitted to the Imperial Diet in Tokyo, the movement submitted 15 petitions over 14 years.[^19] The movement was led by Lin Hsien-tang of the newly formed Taiwanese Cultural Association, with Cai playing a key organizational role.[^20]

In 1923, Cai joined the Taiwan Cultural Association (台灣文化協會), where he became deeply involved in educational and cultural activities designed to promote Taiwanese consciousness and literacy.[^21] The association organized lecture tours across the island, established reading rooms and bookstores, and promoted cultural activities to disseminate new knowledge among Taiwan's largely illiterate population.[^22] That same year, on December 16, 1923, Cai was arrested along with fellow activists Cai Huirue and Chiang Wei-shui in what became known as the "POPA Incident."[^23] The mass arrest targeted 99 leaders of the parliament petition movement, and Cai was sentenced to four months in prison.[^24] During his imprisonment, Cai composed the "Song of Taiwan Autonomy," which would become an anthem for the movement.[^25]

By 1927, ideological divisions had fractured the Taiwan Cultural Association. Cai and others grew dissatisfied with colleagues who advocated class struggle and Marxist approaches to anti-colonial resistance.[^26] Following disagreements with leftist leaders like Lien Wen-ch'ing, Cai left the association and co-founded the Taiwan People's Party (台灣民眾黨) with Chiang Wei-shui on July 10, 1927.[^27] This was Taiwan's first political party, marking a significant evolution in organized political resistance.[^28]

However, ideological tensions continued. In August 1930, Lin Hsien-tang and Cai Peihuo launched the Taiwan Local Autonomy Alliance with other prominent activists including Yang Chao-chia.[^29] The alliance had a single focused goal: achieving Taiwanese local autonomy, whether through cooperation with anti-Japanese activists, elites who worked with Japan, or even the Japanese colonial government itself.[^30] Within five months, the alliance had attracted over 1,000 members and regularly drew between 500 and 1,500 people to speeches across Taiwan.[^31] This success led to Cai and 16 other members being expelled from the Taiwan People's Party later that year.[^32] After five years of campaigning, the Japanese government finally conceded limited reforms, allowing public election of half of Taiwan's city and township councilors.[^33]

## Major Achievements

### Language Reform and Literacy Campaigns

One of Cai Peihuo's most significant contributions was his pioneering work in language reform and literacy education. Cai spearheaded the Romanized Taiwanese Movement during the Japanese colonial era, which aimed to develop a romanized writing system for Taiwanese Hokkien (the language spoken by the majority of Taiwan's population).[^34] Building on the Pe̍h-ōe-jī (白話字) romanization system developed by Presbyterian missionaries in the 1860s, Cai promoted romanization as a tool for mass literacy and Taiwanese identity formation.[^35]

Cai's early exposure to romanization through his brother's teaching had convinced him that alphabetic writing systems could enable faster literacy acquisition than Chinese characters, particularly among Taiwan's rural poor.[^36] Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Cai advocated for romanization through publications, lectures, and educational programs. In 1937, he and Lin Xiantang appealed to colonial officials, arguing that written Chinese was critical for most Taiwanese who remained illiterate in Japanese.[^37] Though the Romanized Taiwanese Movement ultimately failed to achieve official adoption, it was important in developing a distinct Taiwanese worldview and self-identity separate from both Chinese and Japanese cultural hegemony.[^38]

### The 1928 Manifesto

Cai's most influential written work was his 1928 manifesto, *Nihon honkokumin ni atau* (日本本国民に与う, "To the People of the Japanese Metropole").[^39] Published by the Taiwan Mondai Kenkyujo in Tokyo, this document represented a watershed moment in Taiwan's anti-colonial discourse.[^40] The manifesto appeared during a year of crisis for Taiwan's political movements: 1928 marked the first post-universal (male) suffrage election for the Imperial Diet, yet Taiwanese remained excluded from voting.[^41]

In the manifesto, Cai directly addressed Japanese citizens in the metropole, systematically documenting the discriminatory structures, policies, and practices that constrained the lives of both ethnic Chinese Taiwanese and indigenous peoples.[^42] Rather than demanding independence, Cai used what scholars have called "imaginative geography" to construct an argument for self-rule that would appeal to Japanese liberal sensibilities.[^43] He argued that granting self-rule to Taiwan was "the only reasonable response to the inequities of colonial rule."[^44]

The manifesto skillfully navigated the political constraints of its time. By 1928, Taiwan's anti-colonial movement had split into a radical Marxist wing and an increasingly marginalized moderate wing; Cai was a prominent representative of the latter.[^45] His moderate approach sought to work within imperial structures rather than overthrow them. However, modern scholars note that Cai's argument "never escaped the logic of empire," as it shied away from independence demands and ignored the violent dispossession of Taiwan's indigenous peoples by both Chinese settlers and Japanese colonizers.[^46]

### Taiwan People's Party Leadership

As co-founder and leader of the Taiwan People's Party (1927-1931), Cai helped establish Taiwan's first modern political organization.[^47] The party provided an institutional framework for channeling Taiwanese political aspirations through legal means. It advocated for expanded suffrage, educational opportunities, freedom of speech and assembly, and reforms to discriminatory legal codes.[^48]

The Taiwan People's Party organized island-wide campaigns, held public rallies that attracted thousands despite constant police surveillance, and petitioned both local colonial authorities and the Imperial Diet in Tokyo.[^49] Though the party was eventually dissolved in 1931 under increasing Japanese repression and internal factional disputes, it established precedents for organized political activity that would influence Taiwan's political development for generations.[^50]

### Educational and Cultural Work

Throughout his activist years, Cai maintained a deep commitment to education and cultural preservation. He helped establish reading rooms and libraries, organized lecture tours to remote areas, and promoted both traditional Taiwanese culture and modern knowledge.[^51] Cai was renowned for using his diplomatic skills and eloquence to build bridges between Taiwanese activists and sympathetic Japanese politicians, hosting cultural activities to promote better mutual understanding.[^52] This approach, while controversial, allowed some reforms to proceed that might otherwise have been impossible under harsh colonial rule.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Collaboration with Colonial Authorities

Cai Peihuo remains one of the most controversial figures in Taiwanese history due to accusations of excessive collaboration with Japanese colonial authorities. While other activists took more confrontational stances or faced severe persecution, Cai was known for cultivating relationships with Japanese officials and working within the colonial system.[^53] Critics argue that his moderate approach ultimately legitimized Japanese rule rather than challenging it fundamentally.

Lin Hsien-tang and Cai Peihuo's Taiwan Local Autonomy Alliance explicitly sought to achieve autonomy "whether working with anti-Japanese activists, elites who cooperated with Japan or even the Japanese themselves."[^54] This pragmatic willingness to cooperate with colonial authorities troubled more radical activists who saw it as betrayal. The alliance's eventual success in securing limited electoral reforms for local councils, while celebrated by moderates, was viewed by critics as merely cosmetic changes that reinforced rather than undermined colonial control.

### Wartime Activities

Cai's actions during the late 1930s and early 1940s drew particularly harsh criticism. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, which sparked full-scale war between Japan and China, Cai moved his family to Tokyo.[^55] There, he published work arguing that China and Japan should not be in conflict—a position that many viewed as supporting Japanese aggression against China.[^56] The Japanese government imprisoned Cai for 40 days for these writings, suggesting they found his position insufficiently supportive of their war effort.[^57]

After his release, Cai traveled to China to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and reconciliation during Japan's brutal occupation.[^58] In July 1945, just before Japan's surrender, he served as secretary to Tagawa Daikichirō and established contact with military intelligence bureaus, becoming involved in underground intelligence work.[^59] While some historians view this as Cai hedging his bets as Japan's defeat became inevitable, others see it as opportunistic collaboration that contradicted his earlier advocacy for Taiwanese interests.

### Post-War Opportunism

Cai's rapid political transformation after Japan's surrender in August 1945 generated significant controversy. Despite decades opposing Japanese colonialism while working within its structures, Cai immediately joined the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) abroad in 1945, even before returning to Taiwan.[^60] He returned to Taiwan in 1946 and was elected as a legislator in the Legislative Yuan in the 1948 elections—Taiwan's first constitutional elections.[^61]

In 1950, after the KMT government's retreat to Taiwan following defeat by Communist forces in mainland China, Cai became the first Taiwanese to serve on the Executive Yuan's political affairs committee.[^62] In 1952, he was appointed deputy director of the Chinese Red Cross and director of its Taiwan branch, positions he held for many years.[^63] Critics saw this seamless transition from Japanese colonial activism to KMT insider as evidence of Cai's fundamentally opportunistic character.

### Peng Ming-min's Accusations

Perhaps the most damning criticism came from Peng Ming-min, a prominent Taiwanese independence activist and scholar. In his memoir *A Taste of Freedom* (often referred to as "Escape"), Peng described Cai as "an extremely vain, hypocritical opportunist who flattered those in power."[^64] Peng accused Cai of cooperating with the KMT government's suppression of dissidents, including members of Peng's own family.[^65]

Peng's accusations carried particular weight because they came from within Taiwan's pro-democracy movement and described Cai's behavior during the authoritarian period when the KMT imposed martial law (1949-1987). According to Peng, Cai used his position within the regime to advance his own status rather than advocate for ordinary Taiwanese, betraying the principles he had espoused during the Japanese period.

### Ignoring Indigenous Rights

Modern scholars have also criticized Cai's political vision for ignoring or marginalizing Taiwan's indigenous peoples. His 1928 manifesto and other writings focused primarily on ethnic Chinese Taiwanese grievances against Japanese rule, while glossing over or ignoring "the dehumanizing violence of the colonial state's dispossession of indigenous peoples."[^66] This blind spot reflected the Chinese-centric worldview of many Taiwanese activists of his generation, who saw indigenous peoples as subjects to be assimilated rather than as peoples with legitimate sovereignty claims.

## Personal Life

Cai Peihuo married Wu Zu (吳足), about whom relatively little is recorded in available historical sources.[^67] The couple had at least one daughter, who married Zhang Hanyu (張漢裕), an economist who studied under Professor Yanaihara Tadao at Tokyo University.[^68] Zhang Hanyu later taught at National Taiwan University's economics department and played an important role in preserving Cai's legacy after his death.[^69]

In 1937, Wu Zu passed away. Cai commemorated her death by composing a classical Chinese poem titled "Remembering My Wife" (憶我妻), demonstrating his continued engagement with traditional Chinese literary forms despite his advocacy for romanization and linguistic reform.[^70] The poem's composition during the tumultuous year of 1937—when Japan launched full-scale war against China—suggests the personal struggles Cai experienced alongside his political dilemmas.

As a Presbyterian Christian from age 13, Cai maintained his religious faith throughout his life, which connected him to networks of missionaries, reformers, and educated elites.[^71] His Christian identity was relatively rare among Taiwan's political activists of his generation and influenced his moderate, reform-oriented approach to social change.

Cai was known for his eloquence, diplomatic skills, and ability to navigate between different cultural and political worlds.[^72] He was fluent in multiple languages including Taiwanese Hokkien, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and classical Chinese, giving him unique abilities to communicate across Taiwan's diverse linguistic communities. His education in physics and chemistry at Tokyo Higher Normal School also gave him credibility as a modern, scientifically-educated intellectual.[^73]

Those who knew Cai described him as skilled at building personal relationships with people across political divides—a talent that enabled his political effectiveness but also fueled accusations of opportunism.[^74] He lived through one of the most turbulent periods in Taiwanese history, witnessing the end of Qing rule, 50 years of Japanese colonization, and the arrival of KMT rule, finally dying on January 4, 1983, at the age of 94, having outlived most of his contemporaries.[^75]

## Legacy

Cai Peihuo's legacy remains deeply contested in Taiwan, with different political movements claiming or rejecting him based on their ideological commitments. His impact on Taiwan's political development is undeniable, yet interpretations of that impact vary dramatically.

### Pioneer of Taiwanese Political Activism

Cai is widely credited as one of the founding fathers of modern Taiwanese political activism. His work in establishing *Taiwan Youth* magazine, co-founding the Taiwan People's Party, and organizing the Taiwan Local Autonomy Alliance created institutional frameworks that shaped how Taiwanese pursued political goals for generations.[^76] The petition movement, lecture tours, and cultural organizations he helped build demonstrated that Taiwanese could organize collectively to advocate for their interests despite colonial repression.

His moderate, reformist approach established one of the two main strands of Taiwanese political thought—the other being more radical independence advocacy. For those who believe in working within existing systems to achieve gradual reform, Cai represents an important precedent.[^77] His ability to achieve limited but real concessions from Japanese authorities, such as partial local council elections, demonstrated that patient negotiation could yield results.

### Language and Literacy Reform

Cai's work on romanization and literacy campaigns, though ultimately unsuccessful in his lifetime, anticipated later language policy debates in Taiwan. His Romanized Taiwanese Movement aimed to preserve Taiwanese linguistic identity against both Japanese and Mandarin Chinese dominance.[^78] In the 21st century, Taiwan's Ministry of Education has promoted Tâi-lô, a romanization system derived from the Pe̍h-ōe-jī that Cai championed, vindicating aspects of his vision.[^79]

His broader advocacy for mother-tongue education and multilingualism influenced subsequent generations of language activists who resisted the KMT's Mandarin-only policies during the martial law era (1949-1987) and who continue to advocate for Taiwanese, Hakka, and indigenous language preservation today.[^80]

### Historical Documentation

After Cai's death in 1983, his son-in-law Zhang Hanyu worked to collect, edit, and publish Cai's writings, diaries, and correspondence as the *Cai Peihuo Complete Works* (蔡培火全集).[^81] Zhang hoped these materials would "help the world understand Cai Peihuo's contributions to Taiwan."[^82] Cai's diary from 1929-1936 has proven particularly valuable for historians studying Taiwan's colonial period, providing rare first-person documentation of activist life under Japanese rule.[^83]

Scholarly studies of Cai's diary have explored how the "first generation of Japanese-educated, bilingual middlemen envisioned their futures" and reveal his "inner dilemma in identifying with the colonial Weltanschauung."[^84] These materials have made Cai an important case study for understanding the psychological and political complexities of colonial subjecthood.

### Controversial Symbol

For Taiwan independence activists, Cai represents the failures of collaboration and incrementalism. His willingness to work within Japanese and later KMT structures, rather than demanding independence, exemplifies what critics see as a self-defeating accommodation to outside rule.[^85] Peng Ming-min's harsh characterization of Cai as a "vain, hypocritical opportunist" resonates with those who believe Taiwanese should have taken more confrontational stances against both Japanese colonialism and KMT authoritarianism.[^86]

Conversely, for those who emphasize Taiwan's complex relationship with both Japan and China, Cai represents a pragmatic realism about Taiwan's limited options as a small territory caught between great powers. His advocacy for Taiwanese interests through negotiation rather than armed resistance arguably prevented bloodshed and achieved incremental improvements in Taiwanese welfare.[^87]

### Recognition and Commemoration

Taiwan's Ministry of Culture has recognized Cai as a significant "Social Activist," acknowledging his role in "cultural, social, and political movements in Taiwan's colonial history."[^88] Various historical exhibitions and academic conferences have examined his life and work. The Bodies and Structures digital history project features extensive analysis of "Cai Peihuo's Inner Territory," exploring his geographic imagination and political thought.[^89]

However, unlike some other anti-colonial activists, Cai has no major monuments or institutions named after him, reflecting the ongoing controversies surrounding his legacy. He occupies an ambiguous space in Taiwan's collective memory—acknowledged as historically significant but not celebrated as a unifying hero.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Many historians view Cai Peihuo as a sophisticated political thinker who understood the constraints of colonial politics and worked skillfully within them to advance Taiwanese interests. Scholars emphasize that Cai was "one of the key players in the home front Taiwanese mobilization movement during the 1920s and 1930s," helping to create Taiwan's first modern political organizations and movements.[^90]

His 1928 manifesto is recognized as an important document in colonial political thought, demonstrating how colonized peoples could craft arguments for self-determination that engaged with metropolitan liberal discourses.[^91] While modern scholars note its limitations—particularly its failure to challenge empire fundamentally or address indigenous rights—they acknowledge it as a sophisticated attempt to leverage Japanese democratic rhetoric for Taiwanese benefit.[^92]

Historians specializing in Taiwan's colonial period note that Cai and his contemporaries faced impossible choices between armed resistance (which the Japanese military crushed brutally), total accommodation (which meant abandoning Taiwanese identity), or the difficult middle path of working within colonial structures while advocating for reform.[^93] From this perspective, Cai's moderate approach was neither collaborationist nor heroic, but rather a realistic response to limited options.

Scholars studying Taiwan's language politics recognize Cai's pioneering role in promoting romanization and mother-tongue literacy.[^94] Though his Romanized Taiwanese Movement failed during the colonial period and faced further suppression under KMT rule, it preserved important linguistic concepts that informed later language revitalization movements.[^95] The eventual official adoption of Tâi-lô romanization in 2006 represents a posthumous vindication of principles Cai advocated eight decades earlier.[^96]

Some historians emphasize Cai's role as a "bridge figure" who could communicate across cultural and political divides—between Taiwanese and Japanese, between elites and common people, between traditional Chinese culture and modern political thought.[^97] His diplomatic skills and multilingual fluency enabled conversations and negotiations that more confrontational activists could not achieve.[^98]

Defenders note that Cai was one of few Taiwanese political figures from the colonial era who "survived into the postwar period relatively without suppression," suggesting his moderate approach enabled him to preserve influence and continue advocating for Taiwanese interests under changed circumstances.[^99] His positions in the KMT government and Red Cross may have allowed him to assist Taiwanese in ways that more marginalized activists could not.

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Cai's entire political career exemplifies the failures of elite-led, reformist politics that ultimately reinforced rather than challenged structures of oppression. His willingness to work with Japanese colonial authorities, critics contend, legitimized Japanese rule and discouraged more radical resistance that might have achieved independence earlier.[^100]

The fact that Cai "never escaped the logic of empire" in his political thought reveals fundamental limitations in his vision.[^101] His arguments for Taiwanese self-rule accepted Japanese sovereignty as a given and framed Taiwanese interests within imperial structures rather than challenging colonialism's basic premises. This moderate position, critics argue, perpetuated rather than dismantled colonial hierarchies.

Scholars critical of Cai emphasize his marginalization of indigenous peoples, noting that his vision of "Taiwan" was fundamentally Han Chinese-centric and ignored or dismissed indigenous sovereignty.[^102] His 1928 manifesto's failure to address "the dehumanizing violence of the colonial state's dispossession of indigenous peoples" reflects a settler-colonial mindset that viewed indigenous lands as rightfully Chinese, disagreeing only about whether Japanese or Chinese should govern them.[^103]

Cai's wartime activities remain particularly problematic. His 1937 publications arguing against China-Japan conflict, his travels to occupied China promoting "friendship" during Japan's brutal occupation, and his intelligence work in 1945 all suggest opportunistic maneuvering rather than principled activism.[^104] Critics note that while Cai faced brief imprisonment, he never experienced the sustained persecution that befell more radical activists, suggesting his collaboration kept him in good standing with authorities.[^105]

His post-war transformation into a KMT insider is viewed by many as final proof of Cai's opportunism. Critics point out that someone who spent decades opposing Japanese colonialism but immediately joined the new colonial regime demonstrates loyalty to power rather than to principles.[^106] Peng Ming-min's characterization of Cai as someone who "flattered those in power" and "cooperated with the Nationalist government's suppression" of fellow Taiwanese carries weight because it describes Cai's behavior when he held actual power.[^107]

Some scholars argue that Cai's moderate approach actually hindered more effective resistance by dividing Taiwan's anti-colonial movement and providing authorities with a "acceptable" alternative to radical activism.[^108] By creating the impression that reform was possible through cooperation, Cai may have discouraged Taiwanese from pursuing independence more vigorously when opportunities existed.

Finally, critics note that Cai's legacy has been selectively appropriated by various political forces. The KMT regime honored him as a "patriotic" Chinese who opposed Japanese rule and supported Chinese reunification, while downplaying his advocacy for Taiwanese autonomy.[^109] This suggests that Cai's political ambiguity made him useful to those seeking to deny rather than support Taiwanese self-determination.[^110]
