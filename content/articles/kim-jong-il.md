## Summary

Kim Jong-il (February 16, 1941 – December 17, 2011) was the second Supreme Leader of North Korea who ruled from 1994 until his death in 2011[^1]. Born in the Soviet Union during World War II, he was groomed from the early 1970s to succeed his father, Kim Il-sung, creating the world's first communist hereditary succession[^2]. His 17-year rule was marked by the development of North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the devastating famine of the 1990s that killed hundreds of thousands to millions, severe human rights abuses, and a pervasive personality cult[^3][^4]. Known as the "Dear Leader," Kim Jong-il implemented "military-first" politics (Songun) while maintaining one of the world's most repressive totalitarian regimes[^5].

## Early Life and Background

Kim Jong-il was born on February 16, 1941, in Vyatskoye, near Khabarovsk in the Soviet Union, where his father Kim Il-sung was receiving military training with Soviet authorities[^6]. However, official North Korean propaganda claimed he was born on February 16, 1942, at a secret military camp on Mount Paektu, Korea's sacred mountain, accompanied by supernatural phenomena including a double rainbow and a new star in the heavens[^7]. According to scholar Lim Jae Cheon, Kim is generally agreed to have been born in Voroshilov, a Soviet military camp near Nikolsk[^8].

His mother, Kim Jong-suk, was Kim Il-sung's first wife and a former guerrilla fighter. In 1945, when Kim was four years old, World War II ended and Korea regained independence from Japan[^9]. His father returned to Pyongyang that September, and in late November, young Jong-il returned to Korea via a Soviet ship, landing at Sonbong[^10]. The family moved into a former Japanese officer's mansion in Pyongyang, complete with a garden and pool, marking the beginning of the Kim family's privileged position in North Korean society[^11].

During the Korean War (1950-1953), Kim Jong-il was moved to China for safety[^12]. He received his education in China during this period before returning to North Korea. He later attended Kim Il-sung University, graduating in 1963 with a degree in political economy[^13]. Some sources indicate he also studied in East Germany for two years, where he trained to be a pilot[^14]. After graduating from university in 1964, Kim Jong-il devoted himself to cultural, ideological, and propaganda work at the Department of Organization and Guidance of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party[^15].

From an early age, Kim Jong-il was exposed to the machinery of totalitarian power and witnessed his father's consolidation of absolute control over North Korea. This upbringing in the heart of North Korea's political elite would profoundly shape his worldview and his later approach to leadership, emphasizing loyalty, control, and the centrality of the Kim family to the North Korean state.

## Rise to Power

Kim Jong-il's ascent to power was unprecedented in the communist world, representing the first hereditary succession in a communist state[^16]. According to East German documents, Kim had been groomed from as early as 1974 to take over the helm of the North Korean state[^17]. The succession process began so early out of fear that "something grave might happen to Kim Il-sung," and extended over two decades[^18].

In 1967, Kim Jong-il was appointed to the state propaganda and information department, where he began to focus his energy on developing the veneration of his father[^19]. It was around this time that the title "Great Leader" came into habitual usage for Kim Il-sung. In 1973, Kim Jong-il became party secretary of the propaganda department[^20]. At the February 1974 plenum, Kim Jong-il was formally proclaimed as the successor and became a member of the Political Council[^21].

The first public confirmation of Kim Jong-il's position as successor came in 1977, when in a booklet he was designated as Kim Il-sung's only heir[^22]. In 1980, he was elevated to the Politburo and was granted the title "Dear Leader," distinguishing him from his father while maintaining the dynastic mystique[^23]. In 1991, he was named commander of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) armed forces[^24].

Kim Jong-il's succession strategy included the early distribution of photographs of the successor, the institutionalization of the Kim-family cult, and the use of mass campaigns, including the Three Revolutions Movement, to build a base of support among cadres in the ruling Korean Workers' Party and among the masses[^25]. He personally guided the production of revolutionary films such as *Sea of Blood* (1969), *The Fate of a Self-Defence Corps Man* (1970), and *The Flower Girl* (1972), using cinema as a tool for ideological indoctrination[^26].

On July 8, 1994, Kim Il-sung died of a heart attack, and Kim Jong-il inherited power[^27]. However, he did not immediately assume all of his father's titles. In October 1997, Kim Jong-il was named General Secretary of the Workers' Party[^28]. In April 1993, he had been named Chairman of the National Defense Commission, a position that became increasingly important under his "military-first" ideology[^29]. This dynastic succession was unprecedented in a communist country, marking a unique development in communist political systems and setting a precedent that would later be followed when Kim Jong-il's own son, Kim Jong-un, succeeded him.

## Major Achievements

### Nuclear Weapons Program

Under Kim Jong-il's leadership, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test in October 2006, becoming the world's ninth nuclear-armed state[^30]. This represented a major shift in the regional and global security landscape. In 2009, a second nuclear test was conducted, further cementing North Korea's status as a nuclear power[^31]. Kim Jong-il leveraged North Korea's nuclear program to help achieve diplomatic and economic objectives, at times offering limited nuclear concessions in return for economic aid and improved relations with the United States[^32].

The nuclear program became a defining legacy that would be passed to his son Kim Jong-un and remains central to North Korea's national strategy[^33]. In 2002, Kim's government admitted to having produced nuclear weapons in violation of the 1994 Agreed Framework with the United States[^34].

### Military-First Politics (Songun)

Kim Jong-il strengthened the role of the military through his Songun ("military-first") policies, making the army the central organizer of civil society[^35]. His regime adopted the basic guideline of "military-first politics" (sŏngun chŏngch'i) to safeguard it from adverse impacts such as the collapse of the Soviet Union and persistent economic hardships at home[^36]. This ideology prioritized military spending and placed the Korean People's Army at the center of political, economic, and social life.

### Diplomatic Achievements

The year 2000 marked a significant milestone in relations between North and South Korea when Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-il came together for the 2000 inter-Korean summit, the first time leaders of each Korea had met since the end of the Korean War[^37]. The June 15, 2000 summit has widely been regarded as the biggest achievement of South Korea's Sunshine Policy[^38]. Kim Jong-il had in-person meetings with both South Korean presidents Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun — still to date, the only two South Korean presidents to actually meet the North Korean leadership in person[^39].

### Economic Initiatives

Kim's rule saw tentative economic reforms, including the opening of the Kaesong Industrial Park in 2003, just north of the demilitarized zone, which represented unprecedented economic cooperation with South Korea[^40]. North Korea adopted economic reforms during the Kim Jong-il era, including enabling state-owned enterprises to make profits in 1997, reforming wages and prices in 2002, and legalizing markets in 2003[^41]. These reforms included the "July 1 economic measures" launched in 2002, though many were reversed by the end of Kim Jong-il's rule[^42].

In 1998, Kim Jong-il revised the Constitution to consolidate power and address economic difficulties, expanding ownership rights to include social organizations alongside the state and cooperatives, reducing state control and fostering a more conducive environment for private ownership[^43].

### Cultural Legacy

Kim Jong-il was a passionate cinephile with a collection of approximately 20,000 films, including James Bond movies, action films, and all Academy Award winners[^44]. His treatise *On the Art of the Cinema* from 1973 is considered the most authoritative work on North Korean filmmaking[^45]. In his 1987 essay "The Cinema and Directing," Kim wrote that cinema occupies an important place in art and literature development and "is a powerful ideological weapon for the revolution and construction"[^46].

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The 1990s Famine

Kim Jong-il was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands, and perhaps millions, of North Koreans through widespread preventable starvation during the "Arduous March" of the 1990s[^47]. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and its support for North Korea in 1991, Kim Jong-il presided over this disastrous period, which killed massive numbers of people through mismanagement of an already ill-equipped economy, combined with droughts and floods that severely hurt the harvest, and brutal policies that steered scarce food to the military and government elites[^48]. Estimates of deaths range from hundreds of thousands to more than 2.5 to 3 million between 1994 and 1998[^49]. Kim's government was accused of "crimes against humanity" for its alleged culpability in creating and prolonging the famine[^50].

### Political Prison Camps and Human Rights Abuses

Kim Jong-il's legacy includes the fate of tens of thousands who have died in the kwanliso (political prison) camps for alleged enemies of the state, where an estimated 200,000 North Koreans continued to work and die in conditions of near starvation and brutal abuse[^51]. Human Rights Watch characterized him as a dictator and accused him of human rights violations[^52]. Amnesty International condemned him for leaving "millions of North Koreans mired in poverty" and detaining hundreds of thousands of people in prison camps[^53]. A Human Rights Watch official described "North Korea under Kim Jong-il has been a human rights hell on earth"[^54].

### Kidnapping of South Korean Filmmakers

Kim Jong-il instructed the kidnapping of South Korean filmmaker Shin Sang-ok and actress Choi Eun-hee in the late 1970s, holding them captive for years and forcing them to make films for him to gain global recognition for North Korea's film industry[^55]. This extraordinary crime demonstrated the regime's willingness to violate international law and human dignity to achieve its objectives.

### Nuclear Proliferation

Kim Jong-il's development of nuclear weapons violated the 1994 Agreed Framework and created regional instability[^56]. His regime's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction came at enormous cost to the North Korean people, diverting resources from desperately needed economic development and humanitarian aid during the famine years.

### Personality Cult and Propaganda

The personality cult built around Kim Jong-il was grandiose, extensive, pervasive, and enduring, with propaganda writers heralding him as "the greatest of great men produced by heaven" and touting him as the world's greatest leader, thinker, scientist, politician, guerrilla leader, and songwriter[^57]. State propaganda made absurd claims, such as that he could walk and talk before the age of six months, and that when he was born, a glacier on the lake on Mount Paektu cracked, a double rainbow appeared in the sky, and a new star appeared in the heavens[^58]. A year after Kim Jong-il's death, North Korea faced serious financial difficulties after spending US$100 million building a personality cult around the deceased leader[^59].

---

## Personal Life

Kim Jong-il had four partners and at least six children with three of them[^60]. He married his first wife, Hong Il-chon, at the behest of Kim Il-sung in 1966, and they had one daughter, Kim Hye-kyung (born 1968), before divorcing in 1969[^61]. He later fathered Kim Jong-nam (born 1971) with his first consort, film star Song Hye-rim, and due to Song being a divorcée, Kim concealed the relationship and son from his father[^62].

In 1974, Kim Jong-il married his second wife, Kim Young-suk. They had two daughters, Kim Sol-song (born 1974) and Kim Chun-song (born 1976), and he divorced her in 1977[^63]. In 1980, Kim Jong-il married his third wife, Ko Yong-hui, who was the de facto First Lady of North Korea from Kim Jong-il's becoming leader in 1994 until her death in 2004[^64]. The couple had two sons, Kim Jong-chul (born 1981) and Kim Jong-un (born 1982 or 1983), and one daughter, Kim Yo-jong (born 1987)[^65].

His third and youngest son, Kim Jong-un, succeeded him as Supreme Leader[^66]. Kim Jong-un came to power with the death of his father, who died from a heart attack in December 2011[^67]. Kim Jong-il's second son, Kim Jong-chul, was "deemed too effeminate" to rule, which left Kim Jong-un, the youngest of the three sons, to succeed his father as the head of North Korea[^68].

Kim Jong-il was known for his eccentric lifestyle and tastes. He favored large-scale epics of Hollywood, including works of John Ford and James Cameron, plus James Bond movies of the 1960s and 1970s, and Japanese monster films like Godzilla[^69]. Although Kim was known to have been privately interested in Hollywood films, he forbade discussion on foreign film concepts at the Aesthetic Review Meeting, an important annual film conference[^70].

In August 2008, Kim Jong-il reportedly suffered a stroke[^71]. He was treated by French doctors at Pyongyang's Red Cross Hospital and suffered a debilitating stroke that raised questions about succession and the stability of his regime[^72]. Despite his health issues, Kim maintained control until his death in 2011.

## Legacy

Kim Jong-il's legacy remains deeply contested and multifaceted. International assessments of his legacy were generally negative, blaming him for the continued economic decline of the country[^73]. However, scholarly perspectives varied by region and approach. Western perspectives and DPRK defectors/refugees were particularly negative, with widespread claims that Kim Jong-il was far less popular than Kim Il-sung and that apparent outpourings of grief were all staged[^74]. Commentators in China and Russia were somewhat more nuanced, noting the continued existence of the DPRK 17 years after Kim Jong-il took power despite widespread predictions in 1994 that neither he nor the regime would last[^75].

Kim Jong-il is associated both with the trauma of famine and crisis in the late 1990s, and with limited steps toward economic reform in the early 2000s that have since been scaled back[^76]. Defectors' reports suggest the view of Kim within his country was more mixed, with Kim Jong-il associated both with the trauma of famine and crisis in the late 1990s and with limited steps toward economic reform in the early 2000s[^77].

The most significant aspect of Kim Jong-il's legacy is the successful establishment of dynastic succession in North Korea. He not only inherited power from his father but successfully passed it to his son, Kim Jong-un, creating a three-generation hereditary dictatorship unique in the modern world[^78]. This dynastic system has proven remarkably resilient despite predictions of collapse.

Kim Jong-il's legacy of military-first politics still governs North Korea[^79]. The nuclear weapons program he developed became a cornerstone of North Korean national strategy and continues to shape regional security dynamics. His emphasis on military power over economic development set a pattern that his son has largely followed, though with some modifications.

The personality cult Kim Jong-il helped create around his father and then around himself has become an integral part of North Korean political culture[^80]. State propaganda dubbed Kim Il-sung "Great Leader" and Kim Jong-il "Dear Leader," with their portraits ubiquitous in the country, appearing in apartments, subway cars, offices, and almost every major facility[^81].

A more considered judgment will in large part depend on how the DPRK develops in the future. If North Korea survives and its circumstances improve, Kim may be remembered as a leader who guided the country through its worst post-war crisis and prepared the way for reform[^82]. However, for most observers, his legacy remains one of human rights abuses, economic mismanagement, and the perpetuation of one of the world's most repressive regimes.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Some scholars and commentators, particularly in China and Russia, have offered more nuanced assessments of Kim Jong-il's leadership[^83]. They note that despite widespread predictions in 1994 that neither Kim Jong-il nor the North Korean regime would survive, the DPRK persisted for 17 years under his leadership and beyond[^84]. This survival through the collapse of the Soviet Union, the devastating famine of the 1990s, and international isolation is seen by some as evidence of political skill and adaptability.

Within North Korea's official historiography, Kim Jong-il is celebrated as a revolutionary leader who upheld the principles of Juche (self-reliance) ideology during an extraordinarily difficult period[^85]. State propaganda credits him with maintaining North Korea's independence and sovereignty against foreign pressure, particularly from the United States. His military-first politics are portrayed as a necessary response to external threats and the key to national survival.

Some analysts acknowledge that Kim Jong-il did implement certain economic reforms, including the July 2002 measures that reformed wages and prices, legalized markets in 2003, and enabled state-owned enterprises to make profits[^86]. The establishment of the Kaesong Industrial Complex in cooperation with South Korea represented an unprecedented opening, albeit limited[^87]. These tentative steps toward marketization laid groundwork that some scholars believe could have led to more significant reform under different circumstances.

Kim Jong-il's diplomatic engagement, particularly the historic 2000 inter-Korean summit with South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, demonstrated a willingness to engage in dialogue and reduced tensions on the Korean Peninsula, at least temporarily[^88]. For this achievement, some credit Kim with pragmatism and strategic flexibility, even if subsequent developments undermined these gains.

Defenders of Kim Jong-il's cultural legacy point to his genuine passion for cinema and his theoretical writings on film, particularly *On the Art of the Cinema*, which some film scholars consider a serious work of film theory, albeit one serving an authoritarian ideology[^89]. His emphasis on culture and propaganda as tools of governance showed sophistication in understanding the importance of narrative and symbolism in maintaining political power.

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among international scholars, human rights organizations, and defectors is that Kim Jong-il was a brutal dictator responsible for crimes against humanity[^90]. Human Rights Watch's assessment that "North Korea under Kim Jong-il has been a human rights hell on earth" reflects the severity of the regime's abuses[^91]. The political prison camp system, with an estimated 200,000 prisoners subjected to forced labor, torture, and starvation, represents one of the worst ongoing human rights situations in the world[^92].

Critics emphasize that Kim Jong-il's policies were directly responsible for the famine that killed hundreds of thousands to millions of North Koreans in the 1990s[^93]. Rather than prioritizing the welfare of his people, Kim maintained military spending and continued to live in luxury while his citizens starved. The regime's refusal to accept international humanitarian aid without strict conditions and its diversion of aid to the military and party elites demonstrated a callous disregard for human life.

Scholars critical of Kim Jong-il point out that his economic "reforms" were minimal, inconsistent, and ultimately reversed[^94]. Unlike China's Deng Xiaoping or Vietnam's reformers, Kim never committed to genuine economic opening. The limited marketization that occurred was a survival response to state collapse rather than a planned reform strategy. His resistance to meaningful economic change perpetuated North Korea's poverty and isolation.

The personality cult surrounding Kim Jong-il is widely condemned as one of history's most extreme examples of totalitarian propaganda[^95]. The absurd claims about his birth, abilities, and achievements, combined with the mandatory worship of Kim family portraits and the severe punishment for any perceived disrespect, created a climate of fear and psychological control that stifled human dignity and freedom of thought.

International relations scholars criticize Kim Jong-il's development of nuclear weapons as a dangerous destabilization of regional security that triggered an arms race and increased the risk of catastrophic conflict[^96]. His brinksmanship diplomacy, threatening nuclear weapons development to extract economic concessions, is seen as irresponsible and ultimately counterproductive, leading to tighter sanctions and greater isolation.

Western scholars and defectors emphasize that any apparent popular support for Kim Jong-il was manufactured through coercion and propaganda rather than genuine affection[^97]. The staged displays of grief at his death, while impressive in scale, reflected the totalitarian control over public expression rather than authentic emotion. Defector testimonies consistently describe a climate of fear, surveillance, and arbitrary punishment that made genuine political opposition impossible.

## Famous Quotes

> "Nothing is impossible for a man with a strong will." [^98]

This quote reflects Kim Jong-il's emphasis on determination and revolutionary spirit, central themes in North Korean ideology.

> "The revolution is carried out by means of one's thought, not through one's family background." [^99]

An ironic statement given that Kim Jong-il himself came to power entirely through hereditary succession.

> "It is my greatest wish to enable our people to live with nothing to envy at the earliest possible date, and it is my greatest pleasure to work energetically, sharing my joys and sorrows with our people, on the road of translating my wish into reality." [^100]

This quote represents Kim's propagandistic self-portrayal as a devoted servant of the people, contradicted by the reality of famine and repression.

> "The core in the Juche outlook on the revolution is loyalty to the party and the leader. The cause of socialism and communism is started by the leader and is carried out under the guidance of the party and the leader." [^101]

This statement encapsulates the centrality of personal loyalty in North Korean political ideology.

> "We oppose the reactionary policies of the U.S. government but we do not oppose the American people. We want to have many good friends in the United States." [^102]

Kim Jong-il's attempt to distinguish between the U.S. government and its people, a common rhetorical device in North Korean propaganda.

> "I am the object of criticism around the world." [^103]

A rare moment of apparent self-awareness from Kim Jong-il acknowledging international condemnation.

> "A man who dreads trials and difficulties cannot become a revolutionary. If he is to become a revolutionary with an indomitable fighting spirit, he must be tempered in the arduous struggle from his youth." [^104]

This quote emphasizes the North Korean ideological emphasis on hardship and struggle as character-building experiences.
