## Summary

Alice Lenshina was a Zambian religious leader who founded the Lumpa Church, one of the most significant independent African churches of the 20th century. She claimed to have died and been sent back by God with a message against witchcraft and sorcery. Her movement attracted over 100,000 followers but clashed with the new Zambian government. The Lumpa uprising of 1964 resulted in hundreds of deaths and the banning of the church.
