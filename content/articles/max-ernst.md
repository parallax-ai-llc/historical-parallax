## Summary

Max Ernst (1891-1976) was a German-born pioneer of the Dada movement and Surrealism, renowned for inventing groundbreaking artistic techniques including frottage, grattage, and the collage novel.[^1] A prolific painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and poet, Ernst achieved the rare distinction of establishing a glowing reputation in three countries simultaneously—Germany, France, and the United States—while still living.[^2] His traumatic experiences during World War I profoundly shaped his anti-aesthetic, anarchistic vision, leading him to challenge artistic conventions and explore the unconscious mind through innovative methods.[^3] Ernst's experimental approach and rejection of traditional painting profoundly influenced Abstract Expressionism and shaped the direction of mid-twentieth-century art.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Max Ernst was born on April 2, 1891, in Brühl, a small town south of Cologne, Germany, the third of nine children in a middle-class Catholic family.[^5] His father, Philipp Ernst, was a teacher of the deaf and an amateur painter, while his mother, Maria Magdalena Kuelp, was a devout Catholic.[^6] Philipp Ernst's dual influence proved formative: his devout Christianity and strict disciplinarianism inspired in young Max a lifelong penchant for defying authority, while his interest in painting and sketching in nature encouraged Max to pursue art.[^7]

During his childhood, Ernst visited asylums and became fascinated with the artwork created by mentally ill patients, an early indication of his interest in the unconscious mind.[^8] He began painting in 1909, producing sketches in the garden of the Brühl castle and creating portraits of his sister and himself.[^9] By the time he completed his studies at the gymnasium in Brühl and entered the University of Bonn in the winter of 1908, Ernst had read most of the important works of modern literature and seen many of the advanced paintings of the early twentieth century.[^10]

In 1909, Ernst enrolled at the University of Bonn to study philosophy, art history, literature, psychology, and psychiatry rather than pursuing formal artistic training.[^11] This interdisciplinary education proved crucial to his later artistic development, particularly his engagement with psychoanalytic theory. In 1912, he visited the Sonderbund exhibition in Cologne, where works by Pablo Picasso and post-Impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauganne profoundly influenced him and helped crystallize his artistic ambitions.[^12] Ernst met Hans Arp in Cologne in 1914, establishing what would become an important artistic friendship.[^13]

## Rise to Prominence

Ernst's path to artistic prominence was interrupted and fundamentally transformed by World War I. After completing his studies in the summer of 1914, he was drafted into the German army and served for four years on both the Western and Eastern Fronts.[^14] He was conscripted into an artillery division where he directly experienced the drama and bloodshed of trench warfare.[^15] This experience left him shocked, traumatized, and profoundly critical of Western culture and the modern world.[^16] In his autobiography, Ernst wrote of his time in the army: "On the first of August 1914 M[ax].E[rnst]. died. He was resurrected on the eleventh of November 1918."[^17]

Ernst's disillusionment after the war drew him to the anti-aesthetic, inherently anarchistic revolt espoused by the Dadaists, and he became a co-founder of the Cologne Dada movement.[^18] He was demobilized and returned to Cologne in 1918, where he married art history student Luise Straus, whom he had met in 1914.[^19] Luise Straus-Ernst was a Jewish German art historian, writer, journalist, and artist, a graduate of the University of Bonn who had completed her thesis in 1917 and later worked as a research associate in the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum.[^20] In June 1920, their son Ulrich, known as Jimmy, was born; he would later become a painter himself.[^21]

After returning from the war, Ernst began creating his first collages in 1919, reworking mundane materials such as scientific manuals and illustrated catalogs from the turn-of-the-century to create stunning, fantastical images without set narratives.[^22] In the Dada period of 1920-21, Ernst, along with Hans Arp, André Breton, Tristan Tzara, and his wife Luise, created the so-called *fatagaga*, or *Fabrication de Tableaux Gasométriques Garantis*, which combined imagery and text.[^23] His war experiences informed his exploration of psychoanalytic theory and unconscious imagery, which became central to his Dada and later Surrealist work.[^24]

In 1921, Ernst met Paul Éluard, who would become a lifelong friend despite extraordinary personal complications.[^25] Éluard bought two of Ernst's paintings and chose six collages to illustrate his poetry collection, *Répétitions* (Repetitions).[^26] In 1922, Ernst entered France illegally and settled into a ménage à trois with Éluard and his wife Gala in Paris, a relationship that would eventually lead to his divorce from Luise Straus in 1927.[^27] That same year, 1922, Ernst moved to Paris, where two years later he became a founding member of the Surrealists, a group of artists and writers whose work grew out of fantasies evoked from the unconscious.[^28]

## Major Achievements

### Pioneering Artistic Techniques

Max Ernst's experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of several revolutionary techniques that would define Surrealist practice. In August 1925, while staying at a hotel in Pornic on the French Atlantic coast, Ernst discovered frottage when he observed a washed-out wooden floor.[^29] He laid pieces of paper over the floorboards and began rubbing with soft black pencil, twisting and turning the pages as he went.[^30] The technique—from the French verb *frotter*, meaning "to rub"—allowed Ernst to create new worlds using materials like leaves and their veins, bark, ragged edges of linen, netting, and most anything at hand with an intriguing texture.[^31] With his frottages, the artist wanted to integrate coincidences into his creative process and stimulate the flow of imagery from his unconscious mind.[^32]

Following his experimentation with frottage, Ernst adopted the logic of this technique to canvas in 1926 in a method called grattage—from the French verb *gratter*, meaning "to scrape."[^33] He placed textured materials such as wood, string, glass, and wire mesh underneath a canvas and applied a coat of paint; after this dried, he applied a second coat and began scraping with tools like a palette knife or a comb.[^34] He would observe the abstract images that appeared before him and allow for the wandering of his unconscious mind, blocking or highlighting aspects of the image to conjure new forms.[^35] Grattage allowed Ernst to harness what he called the "inner eye" and enabled him to develop wider Surrealist ideas, namely the merging of reality with a fantasy realm and the transformation of ordinary objects into the curious, haunting, and uncanny.[^36]

### Masterworks of Painting

Ernst created numerous masterpieces that defined Surrealist painting. "The Elephant Celebes" (1921), regarded as one of his early Surrealist works, is widely considered the first masterpiece of Surrealist painting.[^37] The painting features a large round shape that Ernst based upon a photograph of a Sudanese bin for storing corn, which he refigured as an elephant-like mechanical being from the subconscious.[^38] The work is now housed at Tate Modern in London.[^39]

"Europe After the Rain" (1940-1942), created in New York, bears testimony to the insurmountable reign of warfare that devastated Europe and represents Ernst's psychological interpretation of war-torn Europe.[^40] The monumental painting incorporates the decalcomania technique and depicts a post-apocalyptic landscape filled with ruined architectural structures and metamorphic figures, providing an unparalleled artistic interpretation of the Spanish Civil War and the beginnings of World War II.[^41]

### Collage Novels

In 1929, Ernst returned to collage and created "The Woman with 100 Heads" (*La Femme 100 têtes*), his first "collage novel"—a sequence of illustrations assembled from 19th- and 20th-century reading material, a format which he is credited with having invented.[^42] The plates of this collage novel were created with collages of images derived from scientific works, medical encyclopedias, catalogs, and illustrated stories.[^43] This was followed by "A Little Girl Dreams of Taking the Veil" (*Rêve d'une petite fille qui voulut entrer au Carmel*) in 1930 and "A Week of Kindness" (*Une semaine de bonté*) in 1934.[^44]

### Collaboration with Paul Éluard

Ernst's most significant literary collaboration was "Les Malheurs des Immortels" (The Misfortunes of the Immortals) with Paul Éluard in 1922.[^45] This experimental work challenged traditional conceptions of what illustrations could or should do: Ernst created twenty-one collages composed of engravings cut out from nineteenth-century magazines and catalogs, then Ernst and Éluard worked together on twenty prose poems to accompany the illustrations, sending fragments of text to each other to revise or supplement, often jotted down on postcards.[^46] It is considered a landmark of Surrealism and the first genuine collaboration between two of the movement's most important contributors.[^47]

### Sculptural Work

Ernst's sculptural achievements culminated in "Capricorn," the great monumental sculpture from his years in Sedona, Arizona.[^48] In the summer of 1947, Ernst began playing with cement and scrap iron with assists from box tops, eggshells, car springs, milk cartons, and other detritus.[^49] The original cement and scrap-iron version served as a guardian outside the tiny concrete house that Ernst and artist Dorothea Tanning built in Sedona in 1946.[^50] It was not until 1964 that the work was cast in bronze in an edition of six, and then cast again in 1975.[^51] The sculpture, which refers to the tenth sign of the zodiac, divided Capricorn's attributes between two figures—the horned male and the mermaid.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Nazi Persecution and "Degenerate Art"

Max Ernst was among the avant-garde German artists branded by the Nazis as enemies of the state and a threat to German culture.[^53] By 1933, Hitler and the Nazi Party had seized control of Germany, and by fall 1937, Hitler had accumulated approximately sixteen thousand works of avant-garde art from Germany's national museums, shipping six hundred and fifty works to Munich for his infamous exhibition *Entartete Kunst* (Degenerate Art).[^54] Ernst had approximately two paintings on display in the Degenerate Art exhibition, though both of these artworks were reported to have disappeared, with the possibility of having been destroyed.[^55] A large amount of "degenerate art" by Picasso, Dalí, Ernst, Klee, Léger, and Miró was destroyed in a bonfire on the night of July 27, 1942, in the gardens of the Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume in Paris.[^56]

### Internment as an Enemy Alien

In September 1939, the outbreak of World War II caused Ernst, being German, to be interned as an "undesirable foreigner" in Camp des Milles, near Aix-en-Provence.[^57] Ernst fled from France with the Gestapo on his heels after being interned three times as a German national.[^58] Escaping his confinement in 1940, he traveled to Marseille, the site of Varian Fry's Emergency Rescue Committee, an organization that aided artists attempting to flee Nazi-occupied France.[^59] Through the group, Ernst met the American collector Peggy Guggenheim, with whom he retreated to New York via Lisbon in the summer of 1941.[^60]

### Religious Controversy

Ernst drew considerable controversy with his 1926 painting "The Virgin Chastises the infant Jesus before Three Witnesses: André Breton, Paul Éluard, and the Painter."[^61] This work predated his Nazi persecution and represented his provocative approach to religious subject matter, reflecting his rebellion against the strict Catholic upbringing of his childhood.[^62]

### Exclusion from Surrealist Group

Ironically, when Ernst won the Grand Prize for painting at the 27th Venice Biennale in 1954, this prestigious award had two consequences: his final exclusion from the Surrealist group, but also international recognition that led to numerous solo exhibitions.[^63] This exclusion reflected the ideological rigidity of André Breton's Surrealist movement, which viewed commercial success and institutional recognition with suspicion.[^64]

### Citizenship Complications

After becoming a naturalized American citizen in 1948, Ernst faced difficulties retaining his American citizenship due to the McCarran Act and his extended periods of residence abroad.[^65] Correspondence from circa 1957 shows Ernst's efforts to navigate these bureaucratic challenges while maintaining ties to both the United States and France, where he also gained citizenship in 1958.[^66]

---

## Personal Life

### Marriages and Relationships

Max Ernst had a remarkably complex romantic history involving four marriages and relationships with prominent women in the art world. His first marriage was to art history student Luise Straus in 1918.[^67] Their marriage was complicated by Ernst's involvement in a ménage à trois with poet Paul Éluard and his wife Gala, and was officially dissolved in 1927.[^68] Tragically, Luise Straus-Ernst's life ended in the Holocaust: the ascension of the Nazis caused her to flee to Paris in 1933, and she sent their son Jimmy to London in 1938.[^69] On April 28, 1944, she was arrested in a raid and on June 30 was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where she was killed on an unknown date.[^70]

Ernst met painter Marie-Berthe Aurenche in late 1927 and they married almost immediately.[^71] Marie-Berthe Aurenche (1906-1960), the sister of movie writer Jean Aurenche, was a French aristocrat and artist.[^72] They were photographed by Man Ray in 1928, mixing with the wider group of Surrealists including André Breton.[^73] Ernst and Aurenche became estranged and divorced in 1936.[^74]

Leonora Carrington, a wealthy English debutante, first met and fell in love with Ernst at a dinner party in London in 1937 when she was nineteen years old and he was forty-seven and married to someone else.[^75] Soon after, Carrington moved to Paris to be with Ernst, where she met many of the Surrealists.[^76] In 1938 they moved to the village of Saint-Martin d'Ardèche, near Avignon, where they lived and created art together.[^77] Their relationship ended tragically when Ernst escaped arrest with the help of Peggy Guggenheim, arriving in America together and marrying in December 1941, leaving Leonora alone in France.[^78]

Ernst's marriage to Peggy Guggenheim was quite short despite the creative atmosphere prevailing in their house on the East River, where Ernst had a large and comfortable studio.[^79] During a research assignment for Guggenheim's planned exhibition "31 Women," Ernst met the artist Dorothea Tanning in 1942.[^80] He was captivated not only by her work but also by her personally.[^81] The couple married in 1946, and their artistically fruitful relationship lasted until Ernst's death in 1976—almost thirty years.[^82] Ernst's most successful and long-lasting relationship was with Dorothea Tanning, and for the last thirty years of his life he remained devoted to her.[^83]

### Friendship with Paul Éluard

Despite the extraordinary personal complications of their relationship—including Ernst's affair with Éluard's wife Gala and the ménage à trois arrangement—Éluard and Ernst remained devoted friends throughout their lives.[^84] In a remarkable 1936 speech, Éluard described their experience: "In February 1917, the Surrealist painter Max Ernst and I were at the front, hardly a mile away from each other. Max, a German gunner, was bombarding the trenches where I, a French infantryman, was on the look-out. Three years later, we were the best of friends and ever since we have fought fiercely side by side for the same cause: that of the total emancipation of human-kind."[^85]

### Character and Personality

Ernst was recognized as a rarity—a German artist who impressed his French peers with his wit and imagination.[^86] His art was characterized by abrupt changes of direction and a rigorously self-critical attitude.[^87] Ernst was one of the first artists to apply Freud's "The Interpretation of Dreams" to investigate his deep psyche in order to explore the source of his own creativity.[^88] He believed that "every normal human being (and not merely the 'artist') has an inexhaustible store of buried images in his subconscious, it is merely a matter of courage or liberating procedures... of voyages into the unconscious, to bring pure and unadulterated found objects to light."[^89]

## Legacy

### Influence on Abstract Expressionism

Max Ernst achieved a rare feat in that he established a glowing reputation and critical following in three countries simultaneously—Germany, France, and the United States—while still living.[^90] Along with other artists and friends such as Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall who had fled from the war and lived in New York City, Ernst helped inspire the development of Abstract Expressionism.[^91] Abstract Expressionism was notably influenced by the spontaneous and subconscious creation methods of Surrealist artists like André Masson and Max Ernst.[^92] His desire to paint from the subconscious, also known as automatic painting, was central to his Surrealist works and would later influence Abstract Expressionists Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, and Willem de Kooning.[^93]

Through his association with Peggy Guggenheim, Ernst interacted with the Abstract Expressionists directly, and via his son Jimmy Ernst, who became a well-known German-American Abstract Expressionist painter after the war.[^94] While based in Sedona, Ernst became attracted to Southwest Native American Navajo art as artistic inspiration, and the younger Abstract Expressionists, particularly Pollock, in turn became fascinated with the art of sand painting, which are deeply tied to healing rituals and evocations of the spiritual.[^95]

### Lasting Impact on Art

Ernst's rejection of traditional painting in favor of his own unique techniques (collage, frottage, grattage) captivated young American painters who similarly sought to forge a fresh and unorthodox approach to painting.[^96] He profoundly influenced more than one generation of American as well as European painters, with only Picasso playing a role as decisive as Ernst in the invention of modern techniques and styles.[^97] His proto-Surrealist paintings produced between 1921 and 1923 are considered signature works of the Surrealist movement, and these powerfully appealing and mysterious pictures inspired the early efforts of Yves Tanguy, René Magritte, Salvador Dalí, and other Surrealists.[^98]

### Institutional Recognition

The Max Ernst Museum opened in 2005 in his hometown Brühl, Germany, dedicated to preserving and celebrating his artistic legacy.[^99] Ernst's works are held in major collections including the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Tate Collection in London, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.[^100]

### Posthumous Reputation

Although Ernst is an artist who is better known by art historians and academics than by the general public today, his influence in shaping the direction of mid-century American art is easily recognizable.[^101] In 1976, Ernst passed away, yet his legacy lived on as he continued to become a source of inspiration for artists throughout the world.[^102] He even helped shape the trend of American art during the mid-century, thanks to his brilliant and extraordinary ideas that were unlike those of other artists during his time.[^103]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Art historians and scholars have overwhelmingly praised Max Ernst's contributions to modern art. He is recognized as a primary pioneer of the Dada movement and Surrealism in Europe, whose experimental innovations fundamentally changed the course of twentieth-century art.[^104] Ernst remains a potent and influential figure in the visual arts in the twentieth century, and his art is characterized by abrupt changes of direction and a rigorously self-critical attitude that demonstrated genuine artistic integrity.[^105]

Scholars particularly celebrate Ernst's technical innovations. The diverse, often novel artistic techniques such as collage, frottage, grattage, dripping, and decalcomania facilitated, and indeed marked, the evolution of Ernst's unique visual vocabulary.[^106] The grattage technique allowed Ernst to develop wider Surrealist ideas shared by his contemporaries including André Breton and René Magritte, namely the merging of reality with a fantasy realm, or the transformation of ordinary objects into the curious, haunting, and uncanny.[^107]

Major retrospectives at prestigious institutions have solidified Ernst's reputation. The Museum of Modern Art held exhibitions exploring work created during 1912-27, including approximately 180 paintings, collages, drawings, and prints.[^108] More recently, MoMA presented "Max Ernst: Beyond Painting" in 2017-2018, surveying the career of this preeminent Dada and Surrealist artist with approximately 100 works drawn from the Museum's collection.[^109] In 2005, the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened "Max Ernst: A Retrospective" including works like "Celebes" (1921), "Ubu Imperator" (1923), and "Fireside Angel" (1937).[^110]

Ernst's proto-Surrealist paintings produced between 1921 and 1923 are considered signature works of the Surrealist movement, and these powerfully appealing and mysterious pictures inspired the early efforts of Tanguy, Magritte, Dalí, and other Surrealists.[^111] His collage novel "Les Malheurs des Immortels" (1922) is considered a landmark of Surrealism and the first genuine collaboration between two of the movement's most important contributors.[^112]

### Negative Views

While the search of scholarly literature reveals remarkably few negative assessments of Ernst's artistic contributions, some criticisms can be identified. His final exclusion from the Surrealist group following his Venice Biennale prize in 1954 reflects the movement's view that his acceptance of commercial success and institutional recognition represented a betrayal of Surrealist principles.[^113] André Breton's rigid ideological stance viewed such mainstream recognition with suspicion, suggesting that Ernst had compromised the revolutionary anti-establishment ethos that had initially defined Surrealism.[^114]

Ernst's complex personal life, particularly his serial marriages and the ménage à trois arrangement with Paul Éluard and Gala, has been subject to criticism from those examining the gender dynamics and power imbalances in Surrealist circles.[^115] The relationship with nineteen-year-old Leonora Carrington when he was forty-seven and married, followed by his abandonment of her when he fled to America with Peggy Guggenheim, has been viewed as emblematic of the exploitative relationships some male Surrealists maintained with younger female artists.[^116]

Some critics have noted that although Ernst is recognized as a potent and influential figure among art historians and academics, he remains less known to the general public than contemporaries like Dalí or Picasso.[^117] This relative obscurity outside academic circles might suggest limitations in the accessibility or popular appeal of his work, though it could equally reflect the vagaries of art market promotion and popular culture rather than artistic merit.[^118]
