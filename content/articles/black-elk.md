## Summary

Black Elk was an Oglala Lakota holy man and visionary whose account of his spiritual experiences, published as Black Elk Speaks, became one of the most important works on Native American spirituality. He witnessed the Battle of Little Bighorn as a boy and participated in the Ghost Dance. He later converted to Catholicism and served as a catechist. His 'Great Vision' at age nine and his integration of Lakota and Christian spirituality have made him an iconic figure.
