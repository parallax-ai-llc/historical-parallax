## Overview

In 1928, Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming returned from a holiday to his messy lab at St. Mary's Hospital in London. He found a petri dish of *Staphylococcus* bacteria that he had accidentally left open. A blue-green mold had contaminated the plate. But around the mold, the bacteria were dead—dissolved. "That's funny," he famously remarked. This accident led to the discovery of **Penicillin**, the world's first antibiotic ("against life"). It turned formerly fatal illnesses (pneumonia, syphilis, gangrene, strep throat) into minor inconveniences.

## The "Funny" Discovery

Fleming identified the mold as *Penicillium notatum*.
He realized the mold secreted a "mold juice" that killed bacteria.
**The Limit:**
Fleming couldn't purify it. The "juice" was unstable. He published a paper in 1929, but it was largely ignored. He mostly used it to purify bacteria cultures, not treat people.

## Florey and Chain (The Realization)

While Fleming discovered it, **Howard Florey** and **Ernst Chain** at Oxford University turned it into a medicine (1940).
**The Output Problem:**
It took 2,000 liters of mold brew to get enough penicillin for one case.
They grew it in bedpans, milk churns, and bathtubs.
**Albert Alexander (1941):**
The first human patient. A policeman who scratched his face on a rose bush and had severe sepsis.
The penicillin cleared his infection wonderfully.
*Tragedy:* The supply ran out. The bacteria returned. He died.
It proved the drug worked, but they needed **mass production**.

## Mass Production (WWII)

The war created a desperate need (gangrene killed more soldiers than bullets in WWI).
US production ramped up. They found a new strain on a **moldy cantaloupe** in a market in Peoria, Illinois that produced 3,000x more penicillin.
By D-Day (1944), there were enough doses for every allied soldier.

## The Nobel Prize (1945)

Fleming, Florey, and Chain shared the Nobel.
**Fleming's Warning:**
In his acceptance speech, Fleming predicted **Antibiotic Resistance**:
*"The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of the man who succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism."*
He was right.
