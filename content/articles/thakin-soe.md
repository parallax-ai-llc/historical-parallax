## Summary

Thakin Soe (1906-1989) was a founding member of the Communist Party of Burma and leader of the Red Flag Communist Party, regarded as one of Burma's most prominent communist leaders.[^1] An ethnic Mon from Moulmein, he was instrumental in introducing Marxist ideology to Burma through his writings and became known as the communist sayagyi (great teacher).[^2] Notorious for his ruthlessness but respected for his unbending nationalism, Soe led an armed insurgency against successive Burmese governments for nearly three decades before his capture in 1970.[^3] His advocacy for ethnic federalism and workers' rights left a lasting impact on Myanmar's political landscape.

## Early Life and Background

Thakin Soe was born in 1906 in Moulmein (present-day Mawlamyine), the capital of Mon State in southeastern Burma.[^4] As an ethnic Mon, he belonged to one of Burma's significant minority communities, which would later influence his political positions on ethnic federalism and minority rights.[^5] Unlike other prominent nationalist leaders such as Aung San and U Nu who attended university, Soe did not pursue higher education but instead worked for the Burmah Oil Company before becoming involved in politics.[^6] According to available records, he was educated at Basic Education High School No. 9 in Mawlamyine.[^7]

Being very much attracted by socialist ideas in his youth, Soe became an avid reader, particularly of books on socialism that were flowing into Burma during the 1930s.[^8] He joined the nationalist Dobama Asiayone ("Our Burma" Association) in the 1930s, a movement composed of young, disgruntled intellectuals who challenged British colonial rule.[^9] The members of this organization adopted the honorific title "Thakin" (meaning "master"), a term traditionally used to address the British, as a form of political defiance and to cultivate what they called a "master mentality" rather than the "slave mentality" imposed by colonialism.[^10]

In 1937, Soe co-founded the Nagani ("Red Dragon") Book Club together with Thakin Than Tun and U Nu, modeled after the British Left Book Club.[^11] As a prominent translator and honorary secretary of the Nagani Book Club, Soe played a crucial role in introducing socialist and communist ideology to the Burmese public through translated works and original writings.[^12] He wrote books and articles in Burmese that made Socialism and Communism accessible to a wider audience, helping to shape an entire generation's political consciousness.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Thakin Soe's rise to prominence began with his intellectual contributions to Burma's nascent socialist movement. In June 1938, his book "Soshalitwada" (Socialism) was published by the Nagani Book Club.[^14] This groundbreaking work utilized Buddhist language and concepts to introduce Marxist ideas to the Burmese people, drawing parallels between dialectical materialism and the Buddhist concept of samkhara (conditioned phenomena).[^15] Soe explained dialectical materialism by referring to the Buddhist doctrine of Dependent Origination, creating a syncretic approach that resonated deeply with Burmese audiences.[^16] The book had a profound impact on Burmese society, and along with other works published by the club, it helped establish socialism as a dominant political ideology in pre-independence Burma.[^17]

In 1939, Thakin Soe published another significant work titled "The Burmese Revolution," which discussed various topics from a dialectical materialist perspective, including class struggle, the accumulation of capital, and revolutionary organization.[^18] The book touched on these subjects using local organic knowledge without foreign hegemony, making Marxist theory relevant to Burma's specific conditions.[^19]

In August 1939, Soe, together with Thakin Than Tun and Aung San, was one of the twelve or thirteen people who founded a communist party cell that later became regarded as the foundation of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB).[^20] By December 1943, Soe had risen to become General Secretary of the Communist Party of Burma, reaching the pinnacle of communist leadership in the country.[^21]

His ideological clarity became evident during World War II. While imprisoned in Insein jail in July 1941, Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe co-authored the historic Insein Manifesto, which identified world fascism as the main enemy in the coming war and called for temporary cooperation with the British in a broad allied coalition that should include the Soviet Union.[^22] This position was against the prevailing opinion in the Dobama movement, as most Burmese nationalists viewed the British colonizers as the primary enemy.[^23] The manifesto followed the Popular Front line advanced by Bulgarian communist leader Georgi Dimitrov at the Seventh Comintern Congress in 1935.[^24]

## Major Achievements

### Underground Resistance Against Japanese Occupation

When the Japanese entered Burma in 1942, Thakin Soe distinguished himself from other nationalist leaders by refusing to collaborate with the Japanese occupiers.[^25] Unlike Aung San, Nu, and Than Tun who initially cooperated with the Japanese, Soe went underground in the Irrawaddy Delta to organize armed resistance against the Japanese occupation.[^26] He had already gone underground to organize resistance, and Than Tun was able to pass on Japanese intelligence to Soe while working within the Japanese-sponsored administration.[^27] Soe's principled anti-fascist stance during the war gave credibility to Burma's post-war nationalist movement and established him as the only prominent Thakin with clear "anti-fascist" activities during the war within Myanmar.[^28]

During the Japanese occupation, Soe cooperated with Ne Win, who commanded an army unit in the delta, serving as a "political advisor" responsible for maintaining the correct political attitude of soldiers.[^29] His role in the independence struggle during World War II was crucial for creating a delicate balance between official cooperation with the Japanese and maintaining resistance networks that would eventually turn against them.[^30]

### Founding the Anti-Fascist Organisation

In August 1944, at a secret meeting in Pegu, Communist leaders Thakin Than Tun and Thakin Soe, Socialist leaders Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein, and the Burma National Army led by General Aung San founded the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO).[^31] The foundation of this popular front against the Japanese was discussed at Thakin Soe's headquarters, demonstrating his central role in organizing the resistance.[^32] At the first meeting, the AFO represented itself to the British as the provisional government of Burma with Thakin Soe as Chairman and Aung San as a member of its ruling committee.[^33] The AFO would later be renamed the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), which secured Burma's independence and formed the initial post-colonial government.[^34]

### Intellectual Leadership and Socialist Education

Thakin Soe wrote at least three books and many pamphlets, earning him the title of communist sayagyi (great teacher).[^35] His impact on shaping the Burmese understanding of socialism and communism dominated the country's history for many decades.[^36] By 1948, when Burma gained independence, almost every articulate politician and nationalist in the country claimed to be a socialist, Marxist, or communist, a testament to Soe's intellectual influence.[^37] His former students later drafted policies for socialist organizations, and his books were frequently republished, extending his influence beyond his active political career.[^38]

### Advocacy for Ethnic Federalism

Unlike other Burmese communist leaders who viewed federalism with suspicion, Thakin Soe and his Red Flag Communist Party advocated the establishment of "independent people's republics" for each ethnic group within a federal union, modeled after the Soviet Union.[^39] More importantly, Soe supported the right of each ethnic group to secede from such a union, a radical position that set him apart from the mainstream CPB.[^40] His catchphrase "One ethnic group, one state" and his advocacy for separatism and self-determinism for each ethnicity represented a progressive stance on minority rights that was far ahead of its time.[^41] During the 1950s and 1960s, Thakin Soe and his Red Flag communists succeeded in creating amicable relations with various ethnic minority communities in the border regions of Burma.[^42]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The 1946 Split and Accusations of Ultra-Leftism

In February 1946, Thakin Soe denounced the CPB's leadership, particularly Thakin Thein Pe, accusing them of Browderism, the form of revisionism espoused by Earl Browder, leader of the Communist Party of the United States.[^43] He also denounced Thakin Than Tun as a "Browderist," charging that they had taken a compromising stand towards imperialism and opportunistic elements.[^44] Soe and Ba Tin had traveled to India in September 1945 to meet with the Communist Party of India, where Browderism was already under attack, and Soe returned convinced that armed struggle was the only way forward.[^45]

After losing his position as General Secretary of the Communist Party in July 1945, just one month after the Allied victory, Soe left the CPB with seven other members of the Central Committee and formed the Communist Party (Burma), popularly known as the Red Flag Communist Party.[^46] The new party opposed working with non-communist groups and called for direct armed confrontation with the British to achieve independence.[^47] With his unilateral focus on armed struggle as the only tactic, Soe can be considered an ultra-leftist according to Trotskyist theory.[^48]

### The Sin Swe Massacre

The atrocity at Sin Swe village remains one of the best-known massacres in post-independent Burma.[^49] In retaliation for passing information to the Tatmadaw (Burmese military), Red Flag Communist Party guerrillas slaughtered the residents of Sin Swe village.[^50] At trial, Myo Swe, a "junior general" in the Red Flag group, testified that he had led the attack on Sin Swe village under the orders of General Myint Aung, a subordinate of Thakin Soe.[^51] According to Soe's widow, Thakin Soe had no knowledge of the massacre.[^52] However, fifty-five years on, what happened in Sin Swe remains a controversial topic for the Red Flag Communist Party, the people, and the government.[^53]

### Personal Scandals and Moral Controversies

Thakin Soe had several personal love affairs that created controversy within the communist movement.[^54] He had to lose his position as general secretary of the party partly because of a love affair, reflecting the conservative moral values that prevailed even among self-proclaimed communists at the time.[^55] When he surrendered to government forces in 1970, he was accompanied by his fifth wife and newly born son, indicating that he had been married at least five times.[^56] In his book, he quoted Marx: "To devote myself to this work, I have sacrificed my well-being, my family life and everything," suggesting his revolutionary work took precedence over family stability.[^57]

### Armed Rebellion and Violence

The Red Flag Communist Party began building up Red Flag Cultivators Unions across Burma, a movement which called on peasants to stop paying rents and taxes.[^58] In July 1946, the governor of Burma Sir Henry Knight issued a ban on the Red Flag Cultivators Unions and the labor wing of the party, the Red Flag Labour Unions.[^59] The government declared the Communist Party (Burma) an unlawful association on 10 July 1946.[^60]

Thakin Soe led an armed rebellion against successive Burmese governments for 24 years, engaging in guerrilla warfare that resulted in significant casualties on both sides.[^61] Soe continued armed struggle against the governments led by Aung San (until his assassination in July 1947), U Nu (1947-1958; 1960-1962), and Ne Win (1958-1960; from 1962 onwards) until 1970.[^62] His uncompromising militant approach alienated potential allies and resulted in the Red Flag Communist Party remaining relatively small compared to the White Flag CPB.[^63]

---

## Personal Life

Thakin Soe lived an underground life fighting different governments from 1942, when he was 37 years old, for almost 30 years.[^64] This clandestine existence shaped his character and personal relationships in profound ways. As noted earlier, he had been married at least five times and had multiple children, though specific details about his family members remain scarce in historical records.[^65]

His personal relationships were often controversial within Burmese society, which remained conservative despite the revolutionary rhetoric of the time.[^66] Even self-proclaimed communists were heavily influenced by conservative values regarding the nuclear family and moral conduct.[^67] Soe's multiple marriages and love affairs challenged these social norms, contributing to both his political troubles and his reputation as a firebrand who lived by his own rules.

During his underground years, Soe demonstrated remarkable dedication to his revolutionary cause. He lived in harsh conditions in the Arakan Yoma mountains and the Irrawaddy Delta, constantly evading government forces while maintaining his guerrilla operations.[^68] An anecdote from his collaboration with Ne Win during World War II reveals his personality: Ne Win, who commanded the troops, reprimanded Soe for ordering lipsticks and nylons for female followers during resistance activities against the Japanese, considering it frivolous behavior during wartime.[^69]

Soe was known for his intellectual rigor and his role as an educator of revolutionary theory. His reputation as the communist sayagyi reflected not only his writings but also his personal commitment to teaching and mentoring young communists.[^70] He was notorious for his ruthlessness in political matters but respected for his unbending nationalism and principled stands against fascism and imperialism.[^71]

## Legacy

Thakin Soe died on May 6, 1989, at age 83, and was buried in Rangoon.[^72] His death came shortly after he had re-entered politics following the nationwide demonstrations against Ne Win's government in August 1988.[^73] In September 1988, he became the patron of the Unity and Peace Party, which he hoped would contest the 1990 elections, though the party received only 3,656 votes.[^74]

Despite his violent anti-government rebellion, Soe was released from prison in 1980 under an amnesty granted by General Ne Win's government to mark a national conference of monks at the Kabar Aye Pagoda.[^75] Remarkably, he was awarded the Medal of State for his part in the Burmese independence struggle, recognizing his contributions during World War II and the anti-colonial movement.[^76]

Soe's legacy is complex and multifaceted. He was one of the most influential members of the Dobama Asiayone and the AFPFL in the fight for Burma's independence from the late 1930s until the country's independence in 1948.[^77] His intellectual contributions, particularly his synthesis of Buddhist philosophy and Marxist theory, created a uniquely Burmese form of socialist thought that influenced generations of political activists.[^78]

His advocacy for ethnic federalism proved remarkably prescient. The establishment of "independent people's republics" for each ethnic group within a federal union and the right for each ethnic group to secede from such a union—positions he championed in the 1940s and 1950s—became main slogans for the Spring Revolution of Burma in the 21st century.[^79] This demonstrates how Soe's vision for a federal, multi-ethnic Burma was far ahead of his contemporaries and remains relevant to Myanmar's ongoing political struggles.

However, his colourful life and character have been widely neglected in scholarship due to the shift of public and academic interest in Burma after 1988.[^80] The Red Flag Communist Party's armed campaign effectively ended with his capture in November 1970, when army forces stormed his hideout in the northern fringes of the Arakan Yoma mountain range.[^81] By the early 1970s, most of the Red Flags' cadres had been crushed by other ethnic insurgent groups such as the Karen National Union (KNU), and the party was militarily defeated by 1978.[^82]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars recognize Thakin Soe as one of Burma's most prominent communist leaders and a key intellectual architect of Burmese socialism.[^83] Robert Taylor and other historians have noted the lasting influence of his work, observing that by 1948, socialist ideology had become dominant among Burma's political class, largely due to Soe's educational efforts.[^84] His synthesis of Buddhist philosophy and Marxist theory is considered innovative and culturally sensitive, demonstrating how revolutionary ideology can be adapted to local contexts without losing its essential character.[^85]

His anti-fascist credentials during World War II are particularly praised. Unlike other nationalist leaders who initially collaborated with Japanese occupiers, Soe maintained a principled opposition to fascism, organizing underground resistance networks at great personal risk.[^86] This moral consistency earned him respect even from political opponents, and his co-authorship of the Insein Manifesto is viewed as a prescient analysis of the global anti-fascist struggle.[^87]

Progressive scholars applaud Soe's advocacy for ethnic federalism and minority rights, which was far ahead of its time.[^88] His support for the right of ethnic groups to self-determination, including secession, represented a radical democratic position that contrasted sharply with the centralized, Burman-dominated nationalism of other leaders.[^89] During the 1950s and 1960s, his ability to build amicable relations with various ethnic minority communities demonstrated the practical viability of his federal vision.[^90]

Contemporary leftist analysts view Soe as an intellectually gifted individual and a radical far-left influenced communist who distinguished himself from reformist social democrats, left-opportunist Stalinists, and what they term "red fascist" Maoists.[^91] His resistance to Stalinist orthodoxy and his critique of Browderism are seen as evidence of independent Marxist thinking rooted in local conditions rather than blind adherence to Soviet directives.[^92]

### Negative Views

Critics point to Soe's ultra-leftist tendencies and his uncompromising insistence on armed struggle as the only valid revolutionary tactic.[^93] His 1946 split from the main Communist Party, based on accusations of Browderism, is viewed by some historians as sectarian and premature, weakening the communist movement at a crucial juncture when unity was needed to negotiate favorable independence terms.[^94] The Red Flag Communist Party remained relatively small and ineffective militarily compared to the White Flag CPB, suggesting that Soe's strategic judgment was flawed.[^95]

The Sin Swe massacre and other atrocities committed by Red Flag forces have tarnished Soe's legacy, regardless of whether he personally ordered them.[^96] As the leader of the organization, he bears responsibility for establishing a culture that allowed such violence against civilians.[^97] The fact that this particular atrocity remains controversial even decades later indicates the deep wounds it caused in Burmese society.[^98]

His personal life, including multiple marriages and affairs, created scandals that undermined his political standing and provided ammunition for his opponents.[^99] Some historians argue that his removal as General Secretary of the CPB was partly due to these personal issues, suggesting that his behavior violated the revolutionary discipline he ostensibly championed.[^100]

The question of whether Thakin Soe was actually a Trotskyist has generated considerable debate. While he was labeled a Trotskyist by Stalinists, Maoists, and mainstream Burmese communists, serious analysis suggests he never qualified as a genuine Trotskyist.[^101] His later adoption of a two-stage revolution theory—suggesting that capitalism had to mature before socialism could thrive—directly contradicted Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution and Lenin's April Theses.[^102] Critics argue this ideological inconsistency reveals confused thinking rather than principled Marxist analysis.

Finally, the futility of his 24-year armed insurgency is cited as evidence of his strategic failures.[^103] Despite decades of guerrilla warfare, the Red Flag Communist Party achieved none of its revolutionary objectives, was eventually crushed militarily, and left Soe imprisoned for high treason.[^104] His uncompromising militancy, while morally consistent, proved politically ineffective and caused unnecessary suffering.
