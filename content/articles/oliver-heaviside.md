## Summary

Oliver Heaviside was a British self-taught mathematician, physicist, and electrical engineer who reformulated Maxwell's equations into the four vector equations used today. He invented the Heaviside step function and operational calculus, predicted the ionosphere (Heaviside layer), and introduced concepts like impedance and inductance. Despite his enormous contributions, he spent his later years as an impoverished recluse.
