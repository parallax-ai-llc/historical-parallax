## Summary

Xu Zhimo (1897-1931) was one of the most celebrated Chinese poets of the 20th century and a pioneering figure in modern Chinese literature. Born into a wealthy merchant family in Zhejiang province, he studied at Cambridge University where he fell in love with English Romantic poetry, particularly the works of Keats and Shelley. Upon returning to China, he founded the influential Crescent Moon Society and became a leader of the modern poetry movement, striving to liberate Chinese poetry from traditional forms and reshape it under Western influences and vernacular language. His romantic personal life, marked by divorce and controversial relationships, and his tragic death in a plane crash at age 34, have made him a legendary figure whose poetry remains compulsory reading in Chinese schools.

## Early Life and Background

Xu Zhimo was born on January 15, 1897, in Xiashi township, Haining County, Zhejiang Province, into what was then the wealthiest family in the locality[^1]. His father, Xu Shenru (1872–1944), was a highly successful merchant and banker who amassed considerable wealth through commerce in the prosperous Xiashi area and maintained connections with influential figures such as the entrepreneur Zhang Jian[^2]. Shenru was an open-minded national capitalist who ran traditional business enterprises including the Xu Yufeng Sauce Garden, Yutong Bank, and Renhe Silk Village, among others[^3]. He also founded a silkworm factory, a cloth factory, the Xiashi Electric Lamp Factory, the Shuangshan Workshop, and was active in both Shanghai and Zhejiang province's financial industry, serving for a long time as the head of Xiashi's Chamber of Commerce[^4]. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, founded by shareholders including Shenru, demonstrated his significant business influence in the region[^5].

Growing up in this environment of wealth and progressive business thinking, Xu Zhimo received an excellent education that would lay the foundation for his later literary career. His family's financial resources enabled him to pursue extensive studies both in China and abroad, opportunities that were rare for Chinese students of his generation. At age 18, in 1915, he was compelled to enter into an arranged marriage with Zhang Youyi, the sister of politician Zhang Junmai[^6]. This arranged marriage went against Xu's belief in free and simple love, though Zhang gave birth to two sons: Chi-kai Hsu (Xu Jikai, born 1918) and Peter Hsu (1922-1925), the latter of whom tragically passed away at age three due to sepsis[^7].

After graduating from Peking University, Xu went to the United States in 1918 to study economics and political science at Clark University, followed by graduate studies at Columbia University[^8]. In 1920, he received an M.A. in political science from Columbia University in New York City[^9]. However, his intellectual journey took a dramatic turn when he became inspired by the writings of Bertrand Russell. He transferred to the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1920 to follow his spiritual mentor Bertrand Russell, wanting to study with both Russell and Harold Laski, two philosophers and theorists whom he greatly admired[^10].

## Rise to Prominence

Xu Zhimo's transformation from a political science student to one of China's most influential modern poets began during his time in England. After a few months at the London School of Economics, he transferred to King's College, Cambridge, as a special student in 1921[^11]. It was at Cambridge that Xu Zhimo underwent a profound intellectual and artistic metamorphosis. He fell in love with English Romantic poetry, particularly the works of John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley[^12]. For eighteen months in the early 1920s, he was an associate member of King's College, where he became acquainted with members of the Bloomsbury Group, many of whom became close friends and mentors[^13].

Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson, a Cambridge don, helped Xu enroll as a special student at King's College, and Xu became lifelong friends with several Bloomsbury members including Virginia Woolf, E. M. Forster, Duncan Grant, and Roger Fry[^14]. During this period, Xu also joined the avant-garde Heretics Society, a Cambridge discussion group that challenged orthodox ways of thinking[^15]. From the Bloomsbury Group, he acquired ideas on the poetic use of images, and he also met Katherine Mansfield and had a brief interview with the English novelist and poet Thomas Hardy[^16]. It was Bertrand Russell, together with other twentieth-century English contemporaries who were greatly influenced by Shelley, who instigated Xu's interest in English Romanticism[^17].

While in London in 1921, Xu met and fell in love with Lin Huiyin, the daughter of Lin Changmin, who would go on to become a renowned architect[^18]. This passionate attachment led him to divorce Zhang Youyi in March 1922, a highly controversial move at the time in Chinese society[^19]. However, Lin was already betrothed to Liang Sicheng, the son of Xu's mentor Liang Qichao, and the two became friends rather than romantic partners[^20].

In 1922, Xu returned to China and immediately became a leading figure of the modern poetry movement[^21]. In 1923, he founded the Crescent Moon Society, a Chinese literary society named after "The Crescent Moon," a poem by Rabindranath Tagore[^22]. Other members included leading author and educator Hu Shih, poets Wen Yiduo and Chen Mengjia, writers Liang Shih-chiu and Shen Congwen, Rao Mengkan, and sociologist Pan Guangdan[^23]. The society was part of the larger New Culture Movement, believing in "art for art's sake" and often engaging in running debates with the Communist-aligned "art for politics' sake" League of the Left-Wing Writers[^24].

## Major Achievements

Xu Zhimo's most significant achievement was his revolutionary transformation of Chinese poetry. He strove to loosen Chinese poetry from its traditional forms and reshape it under the influences of Western poetry and the vernacular Chinese language, becoming one of the most important figures of modern Chinese poetry[^25]. The Crescent Moon School's "newness" lay in elimination of various rules of classical Chinese, old rhymes and old-style metrical poetry, emphasis on syllables and rhythms in poems, and advocacy of nature, translated foreign poems, transplanted foreign poetry styles and forms, and injected new emotional vitality and expression ability into the development of Chinese modern new poetry[^26].

His most famous work, "A Second Farewell to Cambridge" (再别康桥), written in 1928 after his third visit to Cambridge, has become emblematic of modernist Chinese poetry[^27]. The poem is now a compulsory text on Chinese literature syllabuses, learned by millions of schoolchildren across China every year[^28]. The opening and closing lines have become some of the most beloved verses in modern Chinese literature. In the translation by Cyril Birch, the opening reads: "Lightly let me leave now, / Lightly as first I came; / Lightly wave farewell / To the western sky aflame"[^29]. The closing lines, equally poignant, read: "Silently I leave now, / Silent as that first day, / With shake of sleeve, to carry / Not a wisp of cloud away"[^30].

Xu left behind four collections of verse and several volumes of translations from various languages[^31]. Some of his most famous and well-loved works include "By Chance," "You Are in His Eyes," "For Whom," "The Weak Flame of a Star," "A Pipa Tune in an Alley at Midnight," and "Saying Goodbye to Cambridge Again"[^32]. He was not only a poet but also an influential literary organizer and promoter of Western literature in China. In 1927 he helped organize the Xinyue Shudian (Crescent Moon Book Company), and the following year he began editing "Xinyue" ("Crescent Moon"), a literary monthly featuring liberal ideas and Western literature[^33].

In 1924, when the Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore visited China at the invitation of the Beijing Lecture Association, Xu Zhimo served as one of his oral interpreters, translating Tagore's romantic English language into vernacular Chinese[^34]. Xu met Tagore in Shanghai on April 12, 1924, and would act as Tagore's chief interpreter throughout the visit[^35]. A lover of Shelley and Keats, Xu responded passionately to Tagore's poetry for its sophisticated grace and universality[^36]. During this visit, Xu worked alongside Lin Huiyin as interpreters for Tagore, who was warmly received by Liang Qichao and other prominent Chinese intellectuals[^37].

Xu Zhimo worked with other progressive liberal intellectuals including Luo Longji, Liang Shiqiu, Ding Xilin, and Ye Gongchao to form Ping She, a Chinese version of the British Fabian Society, indicating his alignment with social democratic and liberal reform ideas[^38]. His academic background in political and social sciences at Clark University and his graduate studies in economics and politics at Columbia University in 1919 provided him with formal training in political thought[^39]. As an editor for many different monthly magazines, he promoted and introduced Western literature and liberal ideas to Chinese people[^40].

## Controversies and Criticisms

Xu Zhimo's personal life was a constant source of controversy and criticism. His decision to divorce his first wife, Zhang Youyi, in 1922 was highly scandalous in Chinese society at the time. Although his divorce and second marriage went against social norms and aroused the wrath of conservatives, such as his own father and his mentor Liang Qichao, Xu was accepted and even admired in intellectual and literary circles[^41]. It has been said that Xu searched for ideal beauty in women, not loving them for who they are, making him a huge source of controversy and incurring the wrath of Liang Qichao, his teacher and friend[^42].

His second marriage to Lu Xiaoman in 1926 became even more controversial. Lu was married to Wang Geng, a friend of Xu, in an arranged marriage she felt trapped in[^43]. When Xu and Lu met, they quickly bonded over the similarity of their respective experiences with arranged marriages[^44]. The grand wedding ceremony was held in Beijing on Chinese Valentine's Day on October 3, 1926, with Liang Qichao as the chief witness delivering one of the most uncomfortable wedding speeches of all time[^45]. Liang stated: "Zhimo and Xiaoman, as you both have been through a divorce, I hope that you will never have to go through it again. Marriage is a big deal in life and should never be regarded as child's play"[^46]. He concluded with the pointed wish: "I wish you this is the last wedding"[^47]. These strong words not only stunned the bride and groom but the guests as well[^48].

The marriage to Lu Xiaoman brought severe financial and personal difficulties. In the craziest period, Lu Xiaoman would spend 500 yuan a month, while at that time, the living expenses of an ordinary family of four might be less than 40 yuan a year[^49]. Lu's high-end clothing, cosmetics, and social expenses were very costly, and she became addicted to opium, which was undoubtedly another huge expense[^50]. In order to meet Lu Xiaoman's expenses, Xu Zhimo taught in many schools in Beijing and Shanghai, worked as a real estate agency, and tried his best to make money, even teaching at three universities simultaneously[^51]. Faced with his wife who was addicted to drugs, Xu Zhimo advised her to give up smoking, but the sweetness of the past had been gradually worn away by life, leaving only endless quarrels[^52].

Xu Zhimo's literary and political positions also drew criticism. His "art for art's sake" stance put him in direct opposition to Communist-aligned writers who advocated for "art for politics' sake," representing a fundamental debate about the role of literature in society and political transformation during the Republican era[^53]. The criticisms of left-wing students, although understandable in their context, focused on his perceived political disengagement during a time of revolutionary ferment in China[^54].

## Personal Life

Xu Zhimo's personal life was characterized by romantic idealism that often clashed with social reality. His first marriage to Zhang Youyi was arranged when he was 18 years old on October 10, 1915[^55]. Though Zhang gave birth to two sons, Xu could not accept the arranged marriage and divorced her in March 1922 after falling in love with Lin Huiyin while in England[^56]. However, Lin ultimately chose to marry Liang Sicheng, to whom she had been betrothed by her father[^57].

His second wife, Lu Xiaoman, was described as the number one socialite in Beijing, known for her beauty, artistic talents, and sophisticated social presence[^58]. They married in 1926, but their families ostracized them, there were severe money troubles, and Lu became depressed and addicted to opium[^59]. Despite the difficulties, Xu remained devoted to Lu, though their relationship deteriorated due to financial stress and her addiction. After Xu's death, the famous scholar Hu Shi offered to help Lu Xiaoman with three conditions: give up opium, stay away from Weng Ruiwu (who had introduced her to opium), and come to Nanjing, but Lu directly rejected all three conditions[^60].

From his first marriage, Xu had one surviving son who reached adulthood, Xu Jikai (Chi-kai Hsu, born 1918), who became the hope of the Xu family after his father's death[^61]. Xu Jikai later had four accomplished children who were all raised by their grandmother Zhang Youyi while their parents pursued their studies in the United States[^62]. The family included Tony Hsu, Margaret Hsu, Fern Hsu, and Angela Hsu[^63]. Xu Zhimo's great-granddaughter, Alle Xu, became a young movie director born in the United States[^64].

Throughout his life, Xu Zhimo maintained his passion for poetry and literature despite personal turmoil. In the last few years of his life, he worked as an editor in several bookstores and as a professor in many universities[^65]. His personality was characterized by romantic idealism, a belief in free love, and a deep appreciation for beauty in both art and life. His unconventional approach to love and marriage drew significant social criticism during his lifetime, yet he remained committed to his principles of following his heart rather than social conventions[^66].

## Legacy

Xu Zhimo's untimely death on November 19, 1931, at age 34 in a plane crash near Jinan, Shandong province, cut short a brilliant literary career but paradoxically enhanced his legendary status[^67]. On that day, he was traveling from Nanjing to Beijing to attend a lecture given by Lin Huiyin at a university in Peking[^68]. The flight encountered severe fog in the Jinan area, and when the Stinson Detroiter aircraft attempted to turn back to course, it hit the peak of a mountain, breaking off the right wing and crashing into the mountains[^69]. Some conspiracy theories suggested the crash was arranged by romantic rivals, with the most likely suspect being Wang Geng, the former husband of Lu Xiaoman, though investigators found no evidence to support this claim[^70].

His impact on modern Chinese literature has been profound and enduring. Xu Zhimo is celebrated for his innovative poetic style, which broke away from traditional Chinese literary conventions. He introduced Western influences into Chinese poetry, incorporating free verse, romantic themes, and vivid imagery[^71]. His poetry resonated with a generation of readers who were drawn to its emotional depth and modern sensibility[^72]. With Liang Qichao and Hu Shi, Xu formed the Crescent Moon Society, whose modern work style and everyday language tone in their works were huge breakthroughs in Chinese literature[^73].

Today, Xu Zhimo is a household name in China[^74]. Every elementary student in China studies his poetry, demonstrating his enduring impact on Chinese education and culture[^75]. His contributions to modern Chinese literature are widely recognized and appreciated, with his poetry remaining influential and inspiring generations of writers and poets who admire his ability to capture the complexities of human emotion with elegance and grace[^76].

In 2008, King's College Cambridge erected a memorial on the Backs facing the scene described in his famous poem, inscribing the first and last couplet of "A Second Farewell to Cambridge" on Beijing marble[^77]. Ten years later, on August 10, 2018, King's College unveiled a memorial garden dedicated to Xu Zhimo, the first Chinese garden built inside any college campus in Cambridge[^78]. The garden, which took three years to complete, was the result of the vision of Senior Horticulturalist Steven Coghill[^79]. Xu Shanzeng, the oldest grandson of Xu Zhimo, was invited to Cambridge and read his grandfather's best-known poem in the garden during the opening ceremony[^80]. This memorial honors not only Xu Zhimo's literary achievements but also his contribution to Sino-British cultural exchanges[^81].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Xu Zhimo is widely regarded as the leader of the modern Chinese poetry movement and one of the pioneers who combined modern and romantic elements in Chinese poetry[^82]. Scholarly analysis indicates that he creatively transformed modern Western poetry, bringing vernacular Chinese poetry prosperity and interrupting predominant unpoetic trends by giving new poetry aesthetic temperament[^83]. At the University of Cambridge, he became fascinated with English Romantic poetry, and the foreign literature to which he had been exposed shaped his own poetry and helped establish him as a leader in the modern Chinese poetry movement[^84].

Academic perspectives emphasize his role as a cultural mediator between East and West. His life and work was central to the first great opening up of Chinese to Western artistic and literary influences during the 1920s and 1930s[^85]. He translated the poems of Li Qingzhao, a Chinese female poet from the Northern Song Dynasty, from ancient Chinese into Chinese vernacular language, resembling an act of paying homage to classical Chinese poems while making them accessible to modern readers[^86]. Xu Zhimo is considered among the 'academic' authors who theorized less but practiced more than their populist counterparts, alongside Wen Yiduo and Zhu Guangqian[^87].

His grandson Tony Hsu has worked to preserve and promote his legacy, expressing that his dream has been "to write a biography that could encapsulate and preserve my grandfather's legacy and inspire new generations of readers to pick up his poetry"[^88]. The poet's influence extends beyond literature to cultural diplomacy, as evidenced by the ongoing commemorations at Cambridge University and the annual Cambridge Xu Zhimo Poetry and Art Festival[^89]. His "Second Farewell to Cambridge" has become emblematic of modernist Chinese poetry and represents one of the most successful examples of cross-cultural literary influence[^90].

### Negative Views

Despite his literary achievements, Xu Zhimo faced significant criticism during his lifetime and after. Left-wing intellectuals and politically engaged writers criticized his "art for art's sake" position as politically disengaged during a period when China faced severe social and political challenges[^91]. The criticisms of left-wing students, focused on his perceived failure to use literature as a tool for social revolution and political transformation[^92]. His association with liberal intellectuals and promotion of Western literature was seen by some as cultural colonialism and a betrayal of Chinese revolutionary needs[^93].

His role as interpreter for Rabindranath Tagore during the 1924 visit to China also drew harsh criticism. Tagore's lectures and Xu's interpretations faced strong resistance from Chinese intellectuals who sought radical social reform rather than the spiritual and aesthetic messages that Tagore promoted[^94]. This resistance interrupted Tagore's visit and inflicted lasting anguish on his interpreter Xu Zhimo, who found himself defending values that many Chinese intellectuals rejected as irrelevant to China's urgent needs[^95].

His personal life drew even harsher moral criticism. Conservative critics, including his own father and his mentor Liang Qichao, condemned his divorce and remarriage as immoral and irresponsible[^96]. It has been said that Xu searched for ideal beauty in women rather than loving them for who they truly were, suggesting a narcissistic approach to relationships that caused suffering to the women in his life[^97]. His first wife Zhang Youyi, whom he abandoned, was left to raise their children alone, though she later became a successful businesswoman[^98]. His second wife Lu Xiaoman's descent into opium addiction and the couple's severe financial difficulties were seen as consequences of his romantic irresponsibility[^99].

Some critics argue that his poetry, while technically innovative, was overly sentimental and lacked the social consciousness needed during China's turbulent Republican era[^100]. The tension between aesthetic beauty and social responsibility in his work continues to be debated by literary scholars, with some viewing his focus on personal emotion and romantic love as a limitation rather than a strength in the context of modern Chinese literature's development[^101].
