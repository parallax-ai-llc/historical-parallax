## Summary

Michel Foucault (1926-1984) was a French philosopher and historian who became one of the most influential and controversial scholars of the post-World War II period. Associated with structuralist and post-structuralist movements, he fundamentally transformed how we understand power, knowledge, and social institutions through groundbreaking works like *Discipline and Punish* and *The History of Sexuality*. His revolutionary theories on surveillance, biopower, and the relationship between knowledge and power have had profound impacts across anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, and queer theory. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Foucault was the most frequently cited author in the humanities, though his legacy remains contested due to both his controversial political stances and recent allegations regarding his personal conduct.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

Paul-Michel Foucault was born on October 15, 1926, in Poitiers, west-central France, as the second of three children in a prosperous, socially conservative, upper-middle-class family.[^3] His father, Paul Foucault (1893-1959), was a successful local surgeon born in Fontainebleau who moved to Poitiers to establish his own practice. He married Anne Malapert, daughter of prosperous surgeon Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the University of Poitiers' School of Medicine.[^4]

Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, but his mother insisted on the addition of "Michel." Referred to as "Paul" at school, he expressed a preference for "Michel" throughout his life.[^5] This preference became more pronounced as conflict developed with his father, who wanted young Paul-Michel to follow his forebears into the medical profession. Foucault, however, excelled at philosophy and from a young age declared his intention to pursue an academic career, persistently defying his father's wishes. The conflict with his father may have been a factor in Foucault's dropping the "Paul" from his name entirely.[^6]

In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local Lycée Henry-IV, where he undertook two years of elementary education before entering the main lycée, staying until 1936.[^7] His early education was a mix of success and mediocrity until he attended the Jesuit Collège Saint-Stanislas, where he excelled academically.[^8] 

A distinguished but sometimes erratic student, Foucault gained entry at age 20 to the prestigious École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Paris in 1946.[^9] There he studied psychology and philosophy, embraced and then abandoned communism, and established a reputation as a sedulous, brilliant, and eccentric student. He received his license in philosophy in 1948, in psychology in 1950, and was awarded a diploma in psychopathology in 1952.[^10] At the École Normale Supérieure, he developed an intense interest in philosophy and came under the influence of his tutors Jean Hyppolite and Louis Althusser, who provided the intellectual foundation for his later groundbreaking work.[^11] However, Foucault later left the Communist Party after two years because of worsening relations with party colleagues during the time of Stalinism and, according to Althusser, because of his homosexuality.[^12]

## Rise to Prominence

Foucault's ascent to intellectual prominence was marked by constant geographic and intellectual movement. After graduating in 1952 and being awarded the agrégation in philosophy in 1951, he began a career characterized by restlessness and experimentation.[^13] In 1954, he published his first book, *Maladie mentale et personalité* (*Mental Illness and Personality*), which he would later substantially revise.[^14]

From 1955 to 1960, Foucault spent five years outside France as a cultural attaché in Uppsala, Sweden; Warsaw, Poland; and Hamburg, West Germany.[^15] During his time at the University of Uppsala, he was appointed as a Reader in French language and literature while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, serving as a cultural diplomat.[^16] This period of geographical displacement proved intellectually productive, allowing him distance from the Parisian philosophical scene dominated by existentialism and phenomenology.

Foucault's breakthrough came in 1961 when he defended his doctoral dissertation at the ENS. His thesis was published that same year under the title *Folie et déraison* (*Madness and Civilization*), which was critically acclaimed by Maurice Blanchot, Michel Serres, Roland Barthes, Gaston Bachelard, and Fernand Braudel.[^17] This work examined the archaeology of madness in the West from 1500 to 1800, tracing how insanity transformed from being considered part of everyday life to a condition requiring confinement and exclusion.[^18]

Following this success, Foucault taught at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France from 1960 to 1966.[^19] In 1963, he published *The Birth of the Clinic*, further developing his archaeological method. His most spectacular success came in April 1966 with the publication of *The Order of Things: An Archaeology of the Human Sciences* (*Les Mots et les choses*), which began to attract wide notice and established him as one of the most original and controversial thinkers of his day.[^20] The book explored how human beings came to be objects of knowledge and argued that different historical periods possessed underlying conditions of truth that constituted acceptable scientific discourse.[^21]

In 1966, Foucault took up a chair of philosophy at the University of Tunis in Tunisia, where he remained until 1968.[^22] During this period, he witnessed student unrest and political activism that would influence his later work on power and resistance. In 1968, he returned to Paris and became head of the Philosophy Department at the Centre Expérimental de Vincennes.[^23] 

The pinnacle of Foucault's academic career came in 1969 when he was elected to the prestigious Collège de France, where he held the chair in the History of Systems of Thought until his death.[^24] This position at France's most prestigious postsecondary institution provided him with an unparalleled platform for developing and disseminating his ideas. From 1971 until his death in 1984, Foucault gave public lectures at the Collège de France that were seminal events, attended by thousands, creating benchmarks for contemporary critical inquiry.[^25]

## Major Achievements

Michel Foucault's intellectual achievements fundamentally transformed multiple academic disciplines and created entirely new ways of understanding power, knowledge, and social institutions. His work can generally be characterized as philosophically oriented historical research, and toward the end of his life, Foucault insisted that all his work was part of a single project of historically investigating the production of truth.[^26]

### The Archaeological Trilogy

Foucault's first major period produced what scholars call his "archaeological trilogy." His first major book, *The History of Madness* (1961), was followed by *The Birth of the Clinic* (1963) and *The Order of Things* (1966), publications that displayed his increasing involvement with structuralism.[^27] These three histories exemplified a historiographical technique Foucault was developing, which he called "archaeology"—a method for excavating the underlying structures of knowledge that determine what can be thought and said in any given historical period.[^28]

*Madness and Civilization* examined how Western society transformed its treatment of the mentally ill from the late Middle Ages, when fools and lunatics walked the streets freely, to the Age of Reason, when such people began to be considered a threat and asylums were built, erecting walls between the "insane" and the rest of humanity.[^29] The work demonstrated how reason defined itself through the exclusion and confinement of madness.

*The Order of Things* became a bestseller in France and established Foucault's international reputation. The book argued that all periods of history possess certain underlying epistemic structures—what Foucault called "epistemes"—that constituted what was acceptable as scientific discourse.[^30] He traced how human beings became objects of knowledge in the modern period, introducing the provocative claim that "man" as a concept was a recent invention that might soon disappear.

In 1969, Foucault published *The Archaeology of Knowledge*, a methodological treatise about the systems of thought (epistemes) and knowledge (discursive formations) that attempted to systematize his archaeological approach.[^31] This work provided theoretical scaffolding for his historical investigations and introduced key concepts like "discourse," "statement," and "archive."

### Genealogical Works and the Analysis of Power

Beginning in the 1970s, Foucault shifted from archaeology to what he called "genealogy," a method inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche that examined how power relations produce knowledge and shape subjects. His most influential works from this period include *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison* (1975) and *The History of Sexuality* (begun in 1976).[^32]

*Discipline and Punish* revolutionized how scholars understand power, punishment, and surveillance. The book traced the transformation of punishment from public spectacles of torture to the modern prison system based on surveillance and normalization.[^33] Central to this work was Foucault's analysis of Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon, a circular prison design with a central tower from which observers could see into every cell without being seen.[^34] Foucault argued that the major effect of the Panopticon was to induce in inmates "a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power."[^35] Perhaps most importantly, the design ensured that prisoners could never be sure whether they were being observed at any moment, leading to self-regulation and docility.[^36]

Foucault extended this analysis beyond prisons to argue that modern society had become a "carceral archipelago"—a vast network including schools, military institutions, hospitals, and factories that build a panoptic society for its members.[^37] He demonstrated that modern power operates not primarily through violence but through surveillance, discipline, and normalization.[^38] This insight has proven remarkably prescient in the digital age, as the NSA surveillance revelations by Edward Snowden dramatically illustrated how state control can be invisible and comprehensive, perfectly embodying panoptic logic.[^39]

*The History of Sexuality* project examined how sexuality became an object of knowledge and a target of power. In the first volume, *The Will to Knowledge* (1976), Foucault challenged the "repressive hypothesis"—the common assumption that sexuality had been repressed in modern Western societies.[^40] Instead, he argued that the modern period witnessed an explosion of discourse about sexuality, with confession, medicine, psychiatry, and other institutions producing ever more detailed knowledge about sex. This knowledge served as a mechanism of power and control.

Foucault introduced the crucial concept of "biopower"—a form of power that targets the population and individual bodies, administering and regulating human life.[^41] Biopower operates through two poles: anatamo-politics (disciplinary power focused on individual bodies) and biopolitics (power focused on populations, their health, reproduction, and mortality).[^42] According to Foucault, the emergence of biopower meant that "the ancient right to take life or let live was replaced by a power to foster life or disallow it to the point of death."[^43]

### Governmentality and Late Work

In his later lecture courses at the Collège de France, Foucault developed the concept of "governmentality"—the art of governing populations and the technologies, rationalities, and mentalities involved.[^44] This work examined neoliberalism, liberalism, and the changing forms of governmental reason from the 18th century onward. These lectures, published posthumously, have had enormous influence on political theory, sociology, and studies of contemporary capitalism.[^45]

Foucault's final works, published as the second and third volumes of *The History of Sexuality*—*The Use of Pleasure* and *The Care of the Self* (both 1984)—shifted focus to ancient Greek and Roman practices of self-formation.[^46] These works examined how individuals constituted themselves as ethical subjects through practices of self-care, representing a turn toward what Foucault called "ethics" or the relationship of the self to itself.

### Influence and Impact

A central theme unifying Foucault's work is the relationship between power and knowledge—how power controls and defines knowledge, and how knowledge constantly induces effects of power.[^47] As Foucault famously wrote: "There is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge, nor any knowledge that does not presuppose and constitute at the same time power relations."[^48]

Foucault's thought has influenced academics within a large number of contrasting areas, especially those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology.[^49] He is best known for his critical studies of various social institutions, most notably psychiatry, medicine, the human sciences, and the prison system, as well as for his work on the history of human sexuality.[^50] His concerns with sexuality, bodies, and norms have, via the work of Judith Butler in particular, been one of the main influences on contemporary feminist thought and gender studies.[^51] His elucidation of discipline and biopolitics has had noticeable impact on recent studies of colonialism, law, technology, gender, and race.[^52]

All of Foucault's lecture courses at the Collège de France have been published and translated into English, providing scholars with access to the development of his thought over thirteen years from 1970 to 1984.[^53] These lectures have provided crucial insights into concepts like biopolitics, critique, and governmentality that were never fully developed in his published books.[^54]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Michel Foucault's work and life have been subject to intense controversy and criticism from multiple directions, ranging from philosophical objections to his methodology to serious allegations about his personal conduct.

### Personal Controversies and Allegations

In recent years, serious allegations have emerged regarding Foucault's conduct during his time in Tunisia in the late 1960s. Guy Sorman made claims on French television and in *The Sunday Times* that Foucault sexually abused Tunisian prepubescent children, allegedly paying Arab boys for sex at night in a cemetery.[^55] While questions remain about the veracity and details of these accusations, they have sparked significant debate about separating the thinker from his ideas and how to reckon with potential abuses by celebrated intellectuals.[^56]

Adding to these concerns, Foucault signed a 1977 letter along with other French intellectuals including Simone de Beauvoir, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Gilles Deleuze favoring modification of consent laws and decriminalizing consensual sexual relations with persons under 15 years of age.[^57] This petition has been widely criticized and is viewed by many as part of a troubling pattern among certain French intellectuals of that era.

### The Iranian Revolution Debacle

One of the most significant political controversies in Foucault's career involved his journalism on the Iranian Revolution. In 1977, the Italian newspaper *Corriere della sera* asked Foucault to write a column, and in 1978 he traveled to Tehran, days after the Black Friday massacre.[^58] Documenting the developing revolution, he met with opposition leaders such as Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari and Mehdi Bazargan, and discovered popular support for Islamism.[^59] 

Foucault strongly supported what he called the "spiritual revolution" in Iran, an event he believed was meant to save humanity from the clutches of materialism and capitalism.[^60] His articles expressed awe of Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticized in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates.[^61] When news of summary executions on school rooftops in Tehran and mass executions of regime opponents began to make international rounds, Foucault was severely hurt both intellectually and emotionally. He wrote a letter to Iran's interim government Prime Minister condemning the violence and began to distance himself from Islamism, a subject he avoided until his death.[^62] 

This episode has generated extensive scholarly debate, with books like Janet Afary and Kevin Anderson's *Foucault and the Iranian Revolution: Gender and the Seductions of Islamism* examining his controversial endorsement and its implications.[^63]

### Philosophical and Methodological Criticisms

Foucault's work has faced substantial academic criticism regarding its philosophical foundations and methodology. According to Jürgen Habermas, Foucault's criticisms of modern society amounted to "arbitrary partisanship of a criticism that cannot account for its normative foundations."[^64] By ruling out appeal to normative standards that escape their contexts, Foucault allegedly lacked a "normative yardstick" from which to mount his critiques. Similarly, political philosopher Nancy Fraser asked: "why is struggle preferable to submission? Why ought domination be resisted?"[^65] These critics argue that Foucault's rejection of universal values undermines his ability to justify resistance to oppression.

Alan Hunt suggested that by broadening the scope of what power means, Foucault expels law from his analysis, arguing that it might be equally problematic to claim that power is so fluid that it is found everywhere.[^66] This critique points to a potential weakness in Foucault's conception of power as omnipresent—if power is everywhere, how can we identify specific mechanisms of domination or points of resistance?

### Neoliberalism and Political Ambiguity

Late in life, Michel Foucault developed what some scholars consider a troubling sympathy for neoliberalism. Sociologist Daniel Zamora and others have raised serious questions about Foucault's relationship with the neoliberal revolution, particularly his seeming interest in neoliberal critiques of the welfare state.[^67] This has sparked debate about whether Foucault's analysis of governmentality inadvertently provided intellectual resources for neoliberal political projects.

The question of Foucault's overall political stance remains hotly contested, with scholars disagreeing both on the level of consistency of his position over his career and the particular position he could be said to have taken at any particular time.[^68] Some view him as a leftist critic of domination, while others see his rejection of Marxism and his interest in liberalism as more politically ambiguous.

### Contemporary Culture War Attacks

In today's online exchanges and opinion pages, rhetoric against Foucault has risen to new and feverish intensity. Ross Douthat described him as a "satanic figure," and *The American Spectator* blamed Foucault for hatching the "vile serpent" of "deconstruction."[^69] Conservative critics often position Foucault as the intellectual architect of contemporary identity politics, critical race theory, and what they term "woke ideology," though such characterizations often misrepresent the complexity of his thought.[^70]

### Academic Debates on Post-structuralism

Though often cited as a structuralist and postmodernist, Foucault rejected these labels.[^71] American philosopher John Searle suggested in 1990 that the spread of "poststructuralist" literary theory was "perhaps the best-known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon."[^72] Physicist Alan Sokal similarly criticized what he termed "postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now hegemonic in some sectors of the American academy."[^73]

Despite these criticisms, defenders of Foucault argue that while his general epistemological statements may be problematic, his specific genealogical works are concrete enough to avoid self-referentiality and provide valuable historical insights.[^74] Moreover, his influence on feminist theory, queer studies, critical race theory, and postcolonial studies demonstrates the ongoing productivity of his conceptual frameworks, even when the philosophical foundations remain contested.

## Personal Life

Michel Foucault's personal life was marked by intense relationships, political engagement, and the navigation of his sexuality in an era when homosexuality remained deeply stigmatized and, in many places, illegal.

In 1960, Foucault met philosophy student Daniel Defert, beginning a relationship that would last for the rest of his life.[^75] Foucault and Defert maintained a non-monogamous relationship characterized by deep intellectual and emotional bonds despite periods of physical separation.[^76] Earlier in his life, Foucault had entered into a romantic relationship with serialist composer Jean Barraqué. Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs, and engaged in sado-masochistic sexual activity.[^77]

Foucault's homosexuality profoundly shaped his intellectual work and political commitments. His groundbreaking *History of Sexuality* examined how homosexuality became classified as a sexual perversion in the 18th and 19th centuries, contending that our understanding of sexuality is in many ways a social construct.[^78] This work laid philosophical foundations for future LGBTQ literary work and human rights activism by situating the LGBTQ community in the context of power relationships.[^79] Foucault is recognized as a French post-structuralist philosopher associated with the development of queer theory, alongside scholars like Judith Butler and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick.[^80] *The History of Sexuality* was considered a foundational text for what was at the time the relatively new field of queer theory.[^81]

Foucault's political activism extended beyond theoretical work. In May 1971, he co-founded the Groupe d'Information sur les Prisons (GIP) along with historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet and journalist Jean-Marie Domenach.[^82] The organization aimed to investigate and expose poor conditions in prisons and give prisoners and ex-prisoners a voice in French society. Foucault threw himself into this activism, participating in protests and demonstrations. In the early 1970s, his involvement with the prisoners' movement led him to lecture two years running on prisons at the Collège de France, which culminated in his 1975 work *Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison*.[^83]

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Foucault was very active politically. He was a founder of the Groupe d'information sur les prisons and often protested on behalf of marginalized groups.[^84] From the late 1970s onward, Foucault began to spend more and more time teaching in the United States, and by 1983 had agreed to teach annually at the University of California at Berkeley.[^85]

Foucault died in Paris on June 25, 1984, as an early victim of AIDS.[^86] On the second anniversary of Foucault's death, Defert publicly revealed in *The Advocate* that Foucault's death was AIDS-related.[^87] Although the family officially denied that his death was HIV-related, he was the first major public personality in France to die of complications associated with HIV/AIDS.[^88] Following Foucault's death, Daniel Defert founded the AIDES charity in his memory, which became the first national HIV/AIDS organization in France.[^89] Even in the final months of his life, Foucault continued his intellectual work, finishing editing two volumes on ancient sexuality from his sickbed.[^90]

## Legacy

Michel Foucault's legacy as one of the most significant and versatile thinkers of the modern era has left a lasting impact on many fields of study and continues to shape contemporary intellectual discourse decades after his death.[^91] His work remains indispensable for understanding modern disciplines like sociology, philosophy, and political science, with his ideas provoking continuous engagement and reflection while offering valuable insights into contemporary issues.[^92]

### Scope of Influence

At the beginning of the 21st century, Foucault became the most frequently cited author in the humanities in general, a remarkable testament to his enduring relevance.[^93] Today, he remains one of the most influential and widely read social theorists in recent history, with his work proving groundbreaking not only for sociology but also for anthropology, cultural studies, psychology, gender studies, gay and lesbian studies, philosophy, and literary criticism.[^94]

Foucault's multidisciplinary influence has touched academics within a large number of contrasting areas of study, especially those working in anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology.[^95] His insights on power, knowledge, and social structures continue to be relevant in philosophy, sociology, political science, and cultural studies.[^96]

### Theoretical Contributions

Foucault's conception of power as something distributed and present in all aspects of society stood in stark contrast to traditional views of power as concentrated in the hands of the few, fundamentally altering perceptions of power relations across different fields.[^97] His famous formulation—"Where there is power, there is resistance"—has inspired countless scholars and activists to identify and challenge subtle forms of domination.[^98]

The concepts developed in Foucault's work have become essential analytical tools. "Governmentality" has increasingly influenced the study of politics, offering new ways to understand how populations are managed and how individuals are shaped to govern themselves.[^99] "Biopower" has proven particularly relevant for understanding contemporary debates about public health, reproductive rights, genetic engineering, and pandemic management.[^100] "Discourse" has become central to how scholars across disciplines understand the relationship between language, knowledge, and power.

### Impact on Specific Fields

Foucault's concerns with sexuality, bodies, and norms have, via the work of Judith Butler in particular, been one of the main influences on contemporary feminist thought, as well as influential in diverse areas of the humanities and social sciences.[^101] His analysis provided foundational concepts for queer theory, showing how sexual identities are historically constructed and regulated through knowledge-power regimes.[^102]

His elucidation of the dense and minute dimensions of discipline and biopolitics has had a noticeable impact on recent studies of colonialism, law, technology, gender, and race.[^103] Scholars have applied Foucauldian concepts to analyze how colonial regimes exercised power through knowledge production, how racial categories were constructed and policed, and how gender norms were enforced through institutional surveillance.

In criminology and legal studies, *Discipline and Punish* fundamentally transformed how scholars understand punishment, rehabilitation, and the carceral system. Foucault's analysis of the prison as one node in a larger network of disciplinary institutions has proven essential for critical criminology and prison abolition movements.[^104]

### Contemporary Relevance

The digital age has only enhanced the relevance of Foucault's work on surveillance and discipline. His analysis of panopticism has become a crucial framework for understanding contemporary surveillance technologies, social media platforms, and data collection practices. The revelations by Edward Snowden about NSA surveillance programs dramatically illustrated how state control in the digital age can be invisible yet comprehensive—perfectly embodying the panoptic logic where it is not actual observation but the feeling of constant watchfulness that disciplines.[^105]

Foucault's work on biopower has proven remarkably prescient for analyzing contemporary biopolitics, from debates about vaccination and public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic to controversies over reproductive rights, genetic modification, and the governance of life itself. His framework helps scholars understand how modern states increasingly govern through managing population health, longevity, and biological processes.[^106]

### Ongoing Engagement and Debate

Despite—or perhaps because of—controversies surrounding both his ideas and his life, Foucault's work continues to inspire both passionate defense and rigorous critique. His legacy remains contested, with scholars continuing to debate the normative foundations of his critique, his relationship to liberalism and neoliberalism, and how to reconcile his theoretical insights with troubling aspects of his personal conduct.[^107]

Foucault's ideas provoke continuous engagement and reflection, offering valuable insights into contemporary issues and inspiring resistance against rigid institutional norms.[^108] His work has encouraged scholars and activists to question taken-for-granted assumptions about what counts as knowledge, how power operates, and how subjects are formed. His insistence that "the self is not given to us" and that "we have to create ourselves as a work of art" continues to inspire those seeking to transform themselves and their social conditions.[^109]

Today, his work remains indispensable for critical approaches to institutions, power, knowledge, and subjectivity across the humanities and social sciences. Whether scholars embrace, critique, or build upon his ideas, they cannot avoid engaging with the intellectual revolution Foucault helped to create.[^110]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders of Foucault's work point to the concrete insights and historical discoveries that his genealogical method has produced, arguing that while some of his broader epistemological claims may be problematic, his specific analyses remain valuable and well-grounded.[^111] Georges Canguilhem, the distinguished French historian and philosopher of science, was not only a powerful figure in the French university establishment but also Foucault's sponsor and one of his most important and effective supporters throughout his career.[^112] Canguilhem's endorsement provided crucial institutional support and intellectual validation for Foucault's unorthodox approach.

Foucault's early work *Folie et déraison* received critical acclaim from some of the most respected French intellectuals of the era, including Maurice Blanchot, Michel Serres, Roland Barthes, Gaston Bachelard, and Fernand Braudel.[^113] This early recognition from established scholars across different fields demonstrated the breadth and originality of his contribution.

Supporters emphasize that Foucault's work has increasingly influenced the study of politics, primarily via concepts like "governmentality" and "biopower" that have been taken up as analytical tools across disciplines.[^114] His influence extends far beyond philosophy to anthropology, communication studies, criminology, cultural studies, feminism, literary theory, psychology, and sociology, demonstrating the versatility and applicability of his conceptual frameworks.[^115]

Despite criticisms, Foucault has inspired increasingly important alternatives to established practices of cultural and intellectual history, encouraging scholars to examine how knowledge is produced, how subjects are formed, and how power operates through seemingly neutral or benevolent institutions.[^116] His elucidation of discipline and biopolitics has had a noticeable impact on recent studies of colonialism, law, technology, gender, and race, providing scholars with tools to analyze forms of domination that traditional political theory overlooked.[^117]

Defenders argue that at the beginning of the 21st century, Foucault's status as the most frequently cited author in the humanities demonstrates the ongoing productivity and relevance of his work.[^118] The influence of Michel Foucault has been immense, with him being considered a credible source across many disciplines beyond sociology, from literary criticism to political science to medical humanities.[^119]

Foucault's concerns with sexuality, bodies, and norms have fundamentally shaped contemporary feminist thought (particularly through Judith Butler's work), queer theory, and gender studies, providing conceptual resources for understanding how gender and sexual identities are constructed, regulated, and potentially transformed.[^120] His genealogical approach offers scholars ways to denaturalize what seems inevitable and to imagine alternative configurations of power, knowledge, and subjectivity.

### Negative Views

Critics have raised serious philosophical objections to Foucault's work, particularly regarding its normative foundations. Jürgen Habermas argued that Foucault's criticisms of modern society amounted to "arbitrary partisanship of a criticism that cannot account for its normative foundations."[^121] Without appeal to normative standards that transcend particular historical contexts, critics claim Foucault lacks the resources to justify his critiques of domination or to advocate for resistance. Political philosopher Nancy Fraser crystallized this concern by asking: "why is struggle preferable to submission? Why ought domination be resisted?"[^122] These questions point to what critics see as a fundamental incoherence in Foucault's political project.

Alan Hunt suggested that by broadening the scope of what power means to the point where it becomes omnipresent, Foucault's analysis becomes analytically weak, potentially as problematic as claiming power is so fluid that it is found everywhere.[^123] If power is truly everywhere and inescapable, critics argue, then the concept loses analytical precision and the possibility of identifying specific mechanisms of domination or effective strategies of resistance becomes unclear.

The post-structuralist intellectual project more broadly has been criticized for imposing "rather unforgiving limits on what humans can and cannot do in history," with critics arguing that Foucault's anti-humanism and rejection of the subject undermines possibilities for political agency and social transformation.[^124] American philosopher John Searle suggested in 1990 that the spread of "poststructuralist" literary theory was "perhaps the best-known example of a silly but non-catastrophic phenomenon."[^125] Physicist Alan Sokal went further, criticizing what he termed "postmodernist/poststructuralist gibberish that is now hegemonic in some sectors of the American academy."[^126]

Historians have criticized Foucault's historical accuracy and methodology, arguing that he sometimes sacrificed empirical rigor for theoretical coherence, oversimplified complex historical developments, or imposed contemporary concerns onto past contexts. Some specialists have found his accounts of the history of madness, medicine, or sexuality to be overly schematic or inattentive to important details and variations.

Foucault's late engagement with neoliberalism has prompted criticism from left-wing scholars who see his analysis of liberal governmentality as insufficiently critical. Sociologist Daniel Zamora and others have raised questions about whether Foucault's relationship with the neoliberal revolution was too sympathetic, potentially providing intellectual resources for projects aimed at dismantling the welfare state.[^127]

In contemporary culture wars, Foucault has become a target for conservative critics who blame him for contemporary identity politics and what they perceive as excesses of progressive activism. Ross Douthat described him as a "satanic figure," while *The American Spectator* blamed Foucault for hatching the "vile serpent" of "deconstruction."[^128] These attacks often misrepresent Foucault's actual positions, but they reflect the extent to which he has become a symbolic figure in broader political and cultural conflicts.

Most seriously, recent allegations regarding Foucault's conduct in Tunisia and his signing of petitions related to age of consent laws have prompted calls to reevaluate his legacy and to consider how personal misconduct should affect the reception of intellectual work.[^129] These controversies have complicated assessments of Foucault's contribution and raised difficult questions about separating ideas from the individuals who produce them.
