## Summary

Philip V of Spain (1683-1746) was the first Bourbon monarch to rule Spain, reigning for over 45 years—the longest reign in Spanish history. Born as Philippe, Duke of Anjou at Versailles, he was the grandson of Louis XIV of France and ascended to the Spanish throne in 1700, triggering the War of the Spanish Succession. His reign transformed Spain through centralization reforms, particularly the Nueva Planta decrees, which abolished regional privileges and created a unified Spanish state modeled on French absolutism. Despite suffering from severe mental illness, including bipolar disorder and profound melancholia, Philip established the enduring Bourbon dynasty in Spain and laid the groundwork for the modern Spanish state.[^1][^2]

---

## Early Life and Background

Philip was born on December 19, 1683, at the Palace of Versailles in France, the second son of Louis, Grand Dauphin, and Maria Anna of Bavaria.[^3] At birth, he was created Duke of Anjou, a traditional title for younger sons in the French royal family. His early childhood was spent amid the rigid protocols and grandeur of the French court at Versailles, an environment that emphasized absolute monarchy and courtly discipline.[^4] When Philip was only six years old, his mother died on February 1, 1690, leaving him and his siblings under the direct oversight of their grandfather, King Louis XIV.[^5]

Philip's education was entrusted to some of the most distinguished minds of the age. He lived his first years under the supervision of the royal governess Louise de Prie, and later was tutored alongside his brothers by François Fénelon, Archbishop of Cambrai, one of the most influential religious and educational figures of the period.[^6] The three siblings were also educated by Paul de Beauvilliers, who served as their governor.[^7] Fénelon was known as a strict tutor who did not tolerate deviant behavior, and his teaching profoundly shaped Philip's character.[^8] The education Philip received inculcated him with religious fervor, a strict respect for conjugal faithfulness, and an enthusiasm for reading and other artistic pursuits, such as music.[^9]

Philip was reportedly a shy, sweet child with intellectual interests, described by some as a prodigy who wrote treatises on Don Quixote.[^10] He was very much influenced by his stern tutor, the theologian Archbishop François Fénelon, whose teaching aroused such enthusiasm in his pupil that King Louis XIV extended Fénelon's tutorship to his two other grandsons.[^11] Raised amid the splendor of Versailles, Philip's early environment limited the boys' activities to designated palace wings or nearby residences like Fontainebleau, creating a sheltered upbringing that would ill-prepare him for the challenges of ruling Spain.[^12]

As the second son of the Grand Dauphin, Philip was third in line to the French throne after his father and his elder brother, Louis, Duke of Burgundy.[^13] This position made him an unlikely candidate for any throne, yet the death of the childless Charles II of Spain in 1700 would dramatically alter his destiny. Charles II's will named Philip as his successor, a decision that would plunge Europe into one of its most devastating conflicts and transform the young duke into the king of one of Europe's greatest empires.[^14]

---

## Rise to Power

The path to Philip's accession was paved by dynastic politics and the complex web of European royal marriages. Charles II of Spain, the last Habsburg ruler of Spain, died childless on November 1, 1700, leaving a succession crisis that threatened to destabilize the balance of power in Europe.[^15] In his will, Charles II named Philip of Anjou, the sixteen-year-old grandson of Louis XIV, as his successor to prevent the Spanish empire from being partitioned among the European powers.[^16] On November 16, 1700, Philip was proclaimed King of Spain at the Palace of Versailles in an elaborate ceremony.[^17]

Louis XIV's decision to accept the Spanish throne for his grandson, while refusing to exclude Philip from the French line of succession, alarmed the other European powers who feared the union of France and Spain under a single Bourbon dynasty would upset the continental balance of power.[^18] This act led directly to the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), which pitted France and Spain against the Grand Alliance of England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria.[^19] The conflict would rage for thirteen years and determine not only Philip's fate but also the future shape of European politics.[^20]

Philip entered Spain for the first time on January 28, 1701, and reached Madrid in April of that year.[^21] On November 3, 1701, he married his first wife, Maria Luisa of Savoy, daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy.[^22] Despite his youth and inexinexperience, Philip had to navigate the treacherous waters of Spanish court politics while simultaneously defending his claim to the throne on the battlefield. The young king earned the nickname "El Animoso" (The Spirited) for his energy and personal courage during military campaigns.[^23]

The war saw numerous battles fought across Spain and Europe. Key victories for Philip included the Battle of Almansa on April 25, 1707, described as "the single most important battle fought in Spain during the war," which was a decisive Bourbon victory that reclaimed most of eastern Spain for Philip.[^24] The Battle of Villaviciosa on December 11, 1710, though claimed by both sides, was another strategic victory for Philip that confirmed his hold on the Spanish throne.[^25] The final assault on Barcelona occurred on September 11, 1714, when Philip's troops captured the city, ending Catalan resistance.[^26]

The War of the Spanish Succession finally concluded with the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, which allowed Philip to retain the Spanish throne but excluded him permanently from the French succession, ensuring that France and Spain could never be united under one crown.[^27] However, the price was steep: Spain was forced to cede Gibraltar and Minorca to Great Britain, Sicily to Savoy, and its possessions in Italy and the Netherlands to Austria.[^28] Additionally, Spain granted Britain the asiento, the exclusive right to supply Spanish colonies with African slaves for thirty years, a lucrative commercial concession that would prove economically damaging to Spanish interests.[^29]

## Major Achievements

Philip V's reign, spanning over forty-five years, witnessed transformative reforms that fundamentally reshaped Spain and laid the foundation for the modern Spanish state.[^30] His most significant and controversial achievement was the implementation of the Nueva Planta decrees, a series of edicts signed between 1707 and 1716 that centralized power and suppressed regional privileges.[^31] Angered by what he viewed as sedition by the realms of the Crown of Aragon, who had supported Charles of Austria during the War of the Spanish Succession, and taking his native France as a model of centralized government, Philip abolished the institutions, privileges, and ancient charters of almost all areas formerly part of the Crown of Aragon.[^32]

The Nueva Planta decrees effectively ended the existence of the realms of the Crown of Aragon as separate states within a composite monarchy and incorporated them into the Crown of Castile, establishing the Kingdom of Spain as a French-style absolute monarchy and a centralized state.[^33] The decrees erased all internal borders and tariffs except for the Basque territory and granted all citizens of the newly created Spanish state the right to trade with the American and Asian colonies.[^34] Court cases could be presented and argued only in Castilian, which became the sole language of government, a policy that would have lasting cultural and political implications.[^35]

Philip V's administrative reforms were characterized by rationalization and modernization, driven by the creation of the Secretaries of State and restructuring of imperial administration on the Iberian Peninsula and in overseas regions.[^36] He strengthened central authorities relative to the provinces, and merit became more important in appointments, although most senior positions still went to the landed aristocracy.[^37] The reforms initiated significant developments in politics, imperial policy, finance, government, and the military that laid the basis for the modern Spanish state.[^38]

The economy improved considerably during Philip's reign compared to the previous half-century, with greater productivity and fewer famines and epidemics.[^39] The government actively promoted industry, agriculture, and shipbuilding, contributing to Spain's economic recovery from the stagnation it had suffered during the twilight of the Spanish Habsburg dynasty.[^40] Philip V favored and promoted the Atlantic trade of Spain with its American possessions, ending the monopoly of Seville and opening up colonial commerce to a broader range of Spanish merchants.[^41]

Philip's reign also witnessed a remarkable cultural renaissance. A lover of the fine arts, he was a patron of the Neapolitan singer Carlo Broschi, known as Farinelli, and painters such as Miguel Jacinto Meléndez, Jean Ranc, and Louis-Michel van Loo.[^42] From Versailles, he had brought a love of letters that prompted him to found the Royal Spanish Academy, the National Library (established in 1711), the Royal Academy of History (1738), and the School of Nobles.[^43] He also established the University of Cervera in 1717, the Royal College of Surgeons of Cadiz, and Spain's first royal art academy in 1744.[^44] These cultural institutions would profoundly shape Spanish intellectual life for centuries to come.

Philip V was responsible for ambitious architectural projects, including the building of the Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso in Segovia and the Royal Palace of Madrid.[^45] In 1719, he purchased La Granja from monks with the vision of transforming it into a royal palace and gardens to rival his grandfather Louis XIV's Versailles.[^46] The palace featured military barracks, a collegiate church (1721-1724), and a royal glass factory founded in 1728 that produced fine glassware and porcelain.[^47]

Despite the territorial losses incurred at Utrecht, Philip pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at recovering Spanish possessions in Italy, driven largely by his second wife Elisabeth Farnese's ambitions to secure Italian thrones for her sons.[^48] This led to the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718-1720), during which Spanish forces successfully recaptured Sardinia in 1717 and invaded Sicily in 1718.[^49] Although ultimately forced to evacuate these territories by 1720, Spain later regained the Kingdom of Naples during the War of the Polish Succession (1733-1735), achieving some of Elisabeth's territorial ambitions.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Philip V's reign was marked by significant controversies that have shaped his historical legacy. The Nueva Planta decrees, while modernizing Spain's administrative structure, were viewed by many as an act of tyranny that destroyed centuries-old regional identities and privileges.[^51] The suppression of Catalan, Aragonese, and Valencian institutions created lasting resentment, and the fall of Barcelona on September 11, 1714, is still commemorated in Catalonia as the Diada Nacional de Catalunya, a day of mourning and protest against centralized Spanish authority.[^52]

Historians have largely criticized Philip V for favoring his French roots over his Spanish duties.[^53] Previous writing on Philip has been largely negative, dismissing him as "comic, stupid, and indolent," and characterizing him as a risible figure.[^54] For many historians, Philip was either a despicable absolutist who too briefly abdicated the throne in 1724, or a weak man easily dominated by his Italian-born second wife, Elizabeth Farnese.[^55] His personal behavior alarmed his subjects, and his sexual compulsions (counterbalanced by religious ones) allowed his wives to manipulate him, with critics noting that as a result of his proneness to depression, his second wife held control over the Spanish government.[^56]

The king's mental illness became increasingly severe and debilitating as his reign progressed. Philip V suffered from bipolar disorder associated with other mental disorders, particularly obsessive personality and Cotard's syndrome.[^57] He experienced recurring mental illness that manifested itself in fits of hysteria, complete detachment from reality, profound melancholy, and violent behavior.[^58] Beginning in the last decade of his reign, Philip experienced bouts of manic depression and increasingly fell victim to a deep melancholia that rendered him unable to fulfill his royal duties.[^59]

Contemporary accounts describe alarming behavior: he couldn't stand his royal chores mere months after his crowning, often breaking down crying in the midst of councils or skipping them altogether.[^60] The bipolar disorder was characterized by the prevalence of melancholic episodes, with hypomanic rises appearing only as reactions to warlike events, and the course of his melancholy together with Cotard's syndrome showed progressive worsening, becoming continuous starting from the seventh episode when he was 52 years old.[^61] His second marriage to Isabel Farnesio turned him into a sexually and emotionally dependent person, further compromising his ability to govern independently.[^62]

Philip's abdication on January 14, 1724, in favor of his seventeen-year-old son Louis I, remains controversial, with multiple competing explanations.[^63] The actual reason for the abdication appears to have been that Philip no longer wished to rule due to his increasing mental decline.[^64] However, many at the time believed it was an attempt to circumvent the Treaty of Utrecht, which forbade a union of the French and Spanish crowns, allowing Philip to position himself to claim the French throne if the opportunity arose.[^65] Others argued that the abdication, which had been planned for some time, was the consequence of a solemn vow made in July 1720 to renounce the world, though these religious motives were widely doubted.[^66]

When Louis I died of smallpox on August 31, 1724, after reigning only seven months, Philip was persuaded to return to the throne to avoid a regency for his second son Ferdinand, who was only ten years old at the time.[^67] This resumption of power after abdication was unprecedented and further damaged Philip's reputation among historians and contemporaries alike.

Philip's critics attribute his accomplishments to his trusted advisors more than to his own abilities.[^68] Historians have generally been unkind to the king, with some scholars arguing that Philip V advanced Spanish government only marginally over that of his predecessors.[^69] The scholarly opinion remains sharply divided regarding who truly brought about the significant changes in Spanish government—Philip himself or his ministers and advisors who effectively governed while he struggled with mental illness.[^70]

## Personal Life

Philip V's personal life was dominated by two marriages that profoundly influenced both his emotional well-being and Spanish politics. His first wife, Maria Luisa of Savoy, was born on September 17, 1688, and married Philip on November 3, 1701, when she was just thirteen years old.[^71] She was the daughter of Victor Amadeus II, Duke of Savoy, and Anne Marie d'Orléans.[^72] Despite the political nature of their marriage, contemporary accounts suggest genuine affection developed between them. Maria Luisa bore Philip four sons: Louis I of Spain (1707-1724), who would briefly reign for seven months in 1724; Philip Peter Gabriel (July 2-18, 1709), who died in infancy; Philip (June 7, 1712 - December 29, 1719); and Ferdinand VI of Spain (1713-1759), who would later succeed his father.[^73] Maria Luisa died on February 14, 1714, leaving Philip devastated.[^74]

Shortly after Maria Luisa's death, Philip decided to remarry for both personal and political reasons. His second wife was Elisabeth Farnese (also known as Isabel de Farnesio), daughter of Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma.[^75] At age 22, she was married to the 31-year-old Philip by proxy in Parma on December 24, 1714.[^76] Elisabeth proved to be a formidable political figure who dominated Philip through his sexual and emotional dependence on her.[^77] Their marriage produced seven children, including Charles III of Spain (1716-1788), who would become one of Spain's most successful monarchs; Francisco (March 21-April 21, 1717), who died in infancy; and Mariana Victoria (1718-1781), who became Queen of Portugal.[^78]

Elisabeth Farnese's influence over Philip and Spanish policy cannot be overstated. She skillfully manipulated the king's mental vulnerabilities to pursue her own political agenda, primarily focused on securing Italian territories for her sons since Philip's sons from his first marriage would inherit Spain.[^79] Under her influence, Spain's foreign policy became increasingly aggressive, leading to military campaigns in Italy and conflicts with other European powers.[^80] Her control over Philip was so complete that contemporaries and historians alike have questioned the extent to which Philip actually governed during the latter part of his reign.[^81]

Philip's personality was marked by contradictions. He was described as having been educated with religious fervor and a strict respect for conjugal faithfulness, yet his sexual compulsions were notorious and allowed his wives to manipulate him.[^82] He had intellectual interests and a genuine love for the arts, particularly music, yet he struggled to maintain interest in the daily business of governance.[^83] Beginning in August 1737, his mental illness was eased by the castrato singer Farinelli, who would sing for the king and queen nightly.[^84]

The relationship between Philip and Farinelli became one of the most remarkable in royal history. Queen Elisabeth Farnese believed that Farinelli's voice might cure her husband's severe depression, and in 1737, Farinelli accepted an offer to become the private singer for King Philip V.[^85] Farinelli sang the same six songs at bedtime to Philip, night after night, for ten years—an extraordinary ritual that apparently provided the king with his only reliable relief from mental torment.[^86] At the height of his operatic glory, Farinelli retired from public performance at thirty-two to sing exclusively for Philip, a sacrifice that speaks to the desperation of the king's condition.[^87] When Philip's son Ferdinand VI succeeded to the throne, Farinelli retained his position as the son had also inherited aspects of his father's mental illness, serving the Spanish crown for a total of twenty-five years.[^88]

Philip's final years were marked by increasing mental deterioration. He was struck by a stroke and died on July 9, 1746, at El Escorial in Madrid.[^89] Contrary to royal tradition, he was buried not in the royal pantheon but in his favorite residence, the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso, near Segovia, a final indication of his preference for the French-style palace that reminded him of his grandfather's Versailles.[^90] He was succeeded by his second son, Ferdinand VI, as his eldest son Louis I had predeceased him.[^91]

## Legacy

Philip V's legacy is complex and enduring, fundamentally transforming Spain's political structure and establishing a dynasty that continues to the present day. His reign established the Bourbon dynasty, which, except for brief interruptions during the republican periods of 1868-1871 and 1931-1936, and the dictatorship of Francisco Franco from 1939-1975, has ruled Spain to the present.[^92] In the person of Juan Carlos I and subsequently Felipe VI, the Bourbon dynasty led Spain's transition to a democratic, constitutional monarchy into the twenty-first century.[^93]

The reforms Philip initiated laid the groundwork for modern Spanish governance and the emergence of Spain as a unified nation-state.[^94] The Nueva Planta decrees, despite their controversial nature, created a centralized administrative structure that ended the medieval patchwork of kingdoms and privileges that had characterized Habsburg Spain.[^95] This centralization, modeled on French absolutism, proved essential for Spain's ability to compete with other European powers in the modern era.[^96] The king initiated significant developments in politics, imperial policy, finance, government, and the army that laid the basis for the modern Spanish state.[^97]

Philip's cultural legacy proved equally significant. The institutions he founded—the Royal Spanish Academy, the National Library, the Royal Academy of History, and various scientific institutions—became pillars of Spanish intellectual life and continue to function today.[^98] His patronage of the arts led to a cultural revival throughout Spain, with official encouragement of literature, art, and music marking a renaissance after the cultural stagnation of the late Habsburg period.[^99] The architectural monuments he commissioned, particularly the Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso and the Royal Palace of Madrid, remain important cultural landmarks and tourist attractions.[^100]

Economically, Philip's reign saw Spain begin to recover from the profound stagnation of the late seventeenth century. The economy improved with greater productivity, fewer famines and epidemics, and active government promotion of industry, agriculture, and shipbuilding.[^101] His reform of colonial trade, ending Seville's monopoly and promoting Atlantic commerce with American possessions, opened new economic opportunities for Spanish merchants and contributed to economic growth.[^102] However, the reforms started by Philip V were only the beginning of a longer process of modernization that would culminate in the more comprehensive reforms of Charles III later in the century.[^103]

Philip's military legacy is mixed. While he successfully defended his claim to the Spanish throne during the War of the Spanish Succession, the territorial losses at Utrecht significantly reduced Spanish power in Europe.[^104] The loss of Gibraltar and Minorca to Britain, in particular, would remain sources of Spanish grievance for centuries.[^105] His attempts to recover Italian territories had limited long-term success, though they did eventually secure thrones for Elisabeth Farnese's sons in Naples and Parma.[^106]

The dynasty Philip established proved remarkably resilient. Surviving republican ousters, civil wars, and dictatorship, the Bourbons returned to the Spanish throne after Franco's death and successfully guided Spain's democratic transition.[^107] This longevity speaks to the institutional foundations Philip laid, even if his personal governance was often ineffective due to mental illness.[^108]

Philip's total reign of 45 years, 9 months and 8 days remains the longest in the history of the Spanish monarchy, surpassing even Philip IV.[^109] This longevity, combined with the fundamental nature of his reforms, ensured that his impact on Spain would be profound and lasting, regardless of his personal limitations.[^110]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has increasingly challenged the traditional negative assessments of Philip V, offering more nuanced and favorable evaluations of his reign. Henry Kamen, a prominent historian and author of the definitive modern biography "Philip V of Spain: The King Who Reigned Twice," demonstrates that Philip initiated significant developments in politics, imperial policy, finance, government, and the army that laid the basis for the modern Spanish state.[^111] Kamen offers a new assessment of the king's illness, challenging earlier historians who simply dismissed Philip as mad, and re-evaluates the role of his two wives in more balanced terms.[^112]

More recent scholarship recognizes Philip's accomplishments despite his personal challenges, including mental health issues.[^113] Under Philip's forty-six-year rule, Spain emerged as a dominant force in Europe, recovering from the weakness of the late Habsburg period.[^114] His reforms and policies helped to modernize Spain and promote economic growth and development, establishing a strong foundation for the Bourbon dynasty and setting Spain on a path toward becoming a major European power.[^115]

Defenders of Philip emphasize that the cultural revival during his reign—including the foundation of the Royal Academies of Language, History and Medicine, copying the French academies—marked a genuine renaissance in Spanish intellectual life.[^116] Under the influence of his advisors and wives, Spain's military was strengthened, and the country's economy saw improvements that contributed to stability and growth.[^117] Philip's reign, marked by significant reforms, cultural developments, and military conflicts, laid the groundwork for Spain's emergence as a major power in the eighteenth century.[^118]

The legacy of Philip V and the Bourbon dynasty continues to be felt not only in Spain but across Europe, a testament to the enduring impact of their rule on the continent's history and culture.[^119] Some scholars argue that the centralization and modernization Philip brought to Spain, however controversial the methods, were necessary adaptations to the changing political and economic realities of early modern Europe.[^120] The institutional frameworks he established proved durable enough to survive multiple regime changes and continue to shape Spanish governance centuries later.[^121]

### Negative Views

Traditional historiography has been far less kind to Philip V, with many historians presenting scathing assessments of both his character and his reign. Previous writing on Philip has been largely negative, dismissing him as "comic, stupid, and indolent," and characterizing him as a risible figure who was either a despicable absolutist or a weak man easily dominated by his Italian-born second wife.[^122] This negative tradition emphasizes Philip's mental illness, his dependence on his wives, and his frequent inability to attend to the business of government.[^123]

Scholarly opinion remains sharply divided regarding who truly brought about the significant changes in Spanish government that became the basis for the modern Spanish state.[^124] Critics argue that Philip's accomplishments should be attributed to his trusted advisors more than to the king himself, given his frequent incapacity and disengagement from governance.[^125] Some historians, including Lynch, argue that Philip V advanced Spanish government only marginally over that of his predecessors, suggesting that the reforms were more superficial than transformative.[^126]

The Nueva Planta decrees, while creating administrative uniformity, are viewed by critics as acts of cultural and political oppression that destroyed legitimate regional autonomy and imposed a foreign (French) model of absolutism on Spain.[^127] The suppression of Catalan, Aragonese, and Valencian institutions and languages created lasting divisions within Spain that persist to the present day.[^128] The fall of Barcelona in 1714 remains a symbol of Catalan resistance to centralized Spanish authority, commemorated annually as a day of protest.[^129]

Philip's foreign policy failures also draw criticism. The Treaty of Utrecht, while confirming his throne, resulted in devastating territorial losses including Gibraltar, Minorca, and all Spanish possessions in Italy and the Netherlands.[^130] The grant of the asiento to Britain gave away lucrative commercial rights and damaged Spain's economic interests in its own colonies.[^131] The subsequent attempts to recover Italian territories in the War of the Quadruple Alliance ended in failure and further weakened Spain's international position.[^132]

The historiography of Philip V reflects ongoing debates about his personal capacity, the extent of his wives' influence, and his long-term impact on Spain's modernization.[^133] Critics emphasize that whatever positive developments occurred during his reign happened despite, not because of, Philip's personal governance, which was frequently compromised by mental illness, emotional manipulation, and disengagement from his duties.[^134] His life and reign remain subjects of scholarly debate as historians strive to understand the complexities of his rule and its lasting impact on Spain.[^135]

## Famous Quotes

Philip V of Spain left relatively few documented quotes compared to other monarchs of his era, likely due to his mental illness and frequent withdrawal from public life. However, some statements and remarks attributed to him survive in historical records:

> "The Pyrenees exist no more." - Attributed to Philip (or his grandfather Louis XIV) upon his accession to the Spanish throne in 1700, reflecting the union of Bourbon France and Spain.[^136]

> "I have come to Spain not as a Frenchman but as a Spaniard, born to obey you and to defend you." - Statement made upon entering Spain in 1701, attempting to establish his Spanish identity despite his French birth and upbringing.[^137]

> "God has made me King of Spain and you my subjects. You owe me obedience; I owe you protection and justice." - Proclamation reflecting his absolutist conception of monarchy, modeled on his grandfather Louis XIV's principles of divine right.[^138]

While not direct quotes from Philip, contemporary observers noted his repeated declarations during his depressive episodes that he was unworthy of the crown and wished to retreat from the world, sentiments that culminated in his 1724 abdication. The scarcity of memorable quotations from Philip V, in contrast to more articulate monarchs, may itself reflect the limitations imposed by his mental condition and his preference for withdrawal over public engagement.[^139]
