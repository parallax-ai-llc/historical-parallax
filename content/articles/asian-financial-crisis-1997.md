## Overview

The Asian Financial Crisis (1997-1998) was the most severe economic crisis to hit Asia since World War II. Beginning with Thailand's baht devaluation on July 2, 1997, a wave of currency collapses, stock market crashes, and banking failures spread across East and Southeast Asia. The "Asian Tigers"—economies praised for their rapid growth—saw their currencies lose 50-80% of value, GDP collapse, and millions plunge into poverty. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) provided massive bailouts with controversial conditions. The crisis reshaped Asian economies, discredited the "Asian model" of development, and triggered political change including the fall of Indonesia's Suharto after 32 years.

## Background

### The Asian Miracle

**1960s-1990s:**
- East Asian "Tiger economies" grew spectacularly
- South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore
- Then Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines
- Export-led growth, high savings, education investment

### Warning Signs

**By mid-1990s:**
- Current account deficits widening
- Short-term foreign debt increasing
- Property/stock bubbles
- "Crony capitalism" (corruption, connected lending)
- Fixed (or managed) exchange rates

---

## The Crisis Begins

### Thailand: Ground Zero

**Early 1997:**
Speculative attacks on Thai baht. Central bank spent reserves defending peg.

**July 2, 1997:**
Thailand abandoned fixed exchange rate. Baht floated (collapsed).

**Effect:**
Baht fell 50%+ against dollar. Exposed massive foreign debt. Banks/companies insolvent.

### Contagion

**"Asian Flu":**
Investors panicked. Pulled money from entire region.

**Currency Collapses:**
| Country | Currency Fall (Peak) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Thailand | 52% |
| Indonesia | 80%+ |
| South Korea | 50% |
| Malaysia | 45% |
| Philippines | 37% |
