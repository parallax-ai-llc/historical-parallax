## Summary

Yoon Suk-yeol (born December 18, 1960) is a South Korean politician and attorney who served as the 13th and 20th president of South Korea from May 10, 2022, until his removal from office on April 4, 2025.[^1] Previously serving as Prosecutor General from 2019 to 2021, Yoon gained national prominence for leading high-profile corruption investigations that resulted in the convictions of two former presidents.[^2] His presidency was marked by efforts to strengthen ties with the United States and Japan while taking a harder stance toward North Korea and China, but ended abruptly following his controversial declaration of martial law in December 2024.[^3] Yoon became the second South Korean president to be removed from office through impeachment, following a unanimous Constitutional Court decision.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Yoon Suk-yeol was born on December 18, 1960, in the Bomun-dong neighborhood of Seoul's Seongbuk district to a family of distinguished academics.[^5] His father, Yoon Ki-jung, was a prominent economist at Yonsei University who cofounded the Korean Statistical Society and became a member of the National Academy of Sciences.[^6] His mother, Choi Jeong-ja, lectured at Ewha Womans University before leaving her position to marry and raise her family.[^7]

Growing up in an intellectually stimulating household during South Korea's authoritarian era, Yoon witnessed firsthand the tensions between academic freedom and political repression. This environment would profoundly shape his early political consciousness. On May 8, 1980, during the tumultuous period preceding the Gwangju Uprising, Yoon demonstrated early political courage when he took the role of judge in a mock trial of Chun Doo-hwan, the army general who had staged a coup d'état against South Korea's civilian government.[^8] In this mock proceeding, the young student sentenced Chun to death. When the story spread throughout his school, Yoon feared retribution and fled to the home of a relative in Gangneung, where he remained in hiding for three months.[^9]

Yoon pursued his education at Seoul National University, South Korea's most prestigious institution, graduating with an undergraduate degree in law in 1983 and a master's degree in law in 1988.[^10] Despite his academic pedigree, Yoon's path to becoming a prosecutor was far from smooth. After graduation, he studied for the bar exam, only to fail the second of its two sections eight times before finally passing.[^11] This experience of repeated failure and eventual success would later become part of his political narrative, positioning him as someone who understood persistence and resilience. He graduated from the Judicial Research and Training Institute in February 1994 and began his career as a prosecutor that same year.[^12]

## Rise to Power

Yoon Suk-yeol began his prosecutorial career in 1994 at the Daegu District Prosecutors' Office, embarking on what would become a 27-year career in law enforcement.[^13] During his early years as a prosecutor, Yoon worked in various locations including Chuncheon (1996–97), Suwon (1997–99), Seoul (1999–2001), and Busan (2001–02), gradually building a reputation as a tenacious investigator.[^14] In 1999, he successfully prosecuted the National Police Agency's intelligence chief, Park Hee-won, on charges of bribery, demonstrating his willingness to pursue powerful figures.[^15]

Between 2002 and 2003, Yoon briefly left government service to join the prestigious law firm Bae, Kim & Lee, but returned to the prosecutor's life in February 2003, indicating his commitment to public service over private gain.[^16] His career-defining moment came during the investigation of former President Park Geun-hye. In December 2016, Yoon led a special investigation into a corruption scandal involving Park, a probe that resulted in her becoming the nation's first democratically elected leader to be ousted from office.[^17]

Yoon's reputation as an uncompromising prosecutor was further cemented when he served as chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office, where he played a key role in convicting not only Park Geun-hye but also former President Lee Myung-bak for abuse of power.[^18] During his tenure, Yoon's investigations extended beyond former presidents to include Samsung's chief executive and a former chief justice of the Supreme Court, establishing him as what many called an "anti-corruption investigator" who did not bend to political pressure.[^19]

In 2019, President Moon Jae-in appointed Yoon as Prosecutor General of South Korea, a decision Moon would later reportedly regret.[^20] As Prosecutor General from 2019 to 2021, Yoon conducted investigations into Cho Kuk, an influential figure in the Moon administration who had been appointed minister of justice.[^21] The investigation led Cho to resign only 35 days after his term officially began, representing a major embarrassment for Moon's government and creating a rift between Yoon and the presidential administration that had appointed him.[^22]

This public falling-out with the Moon administration paradoxically boosted Yoon's political prospects among conservatives, who viewed him as a principled prosecutor willing to challenge even his political benefactors. On November 5, 2021, Yoon officially won the nomination of the People Power Party for the 2022 presidential election, despite being a political newcomer with no prior electoral experience.[^23] On March 9, 2022, Yoon won the presidential election, defeating the ruling Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung with 48.56 percent of votes compared to Lee's 47.83 percent—a margin of just 0.73 percentage points, the narrowest margin of victory in South Korean presidential election history.[^24] He was inaugurated as the 20th President of the Republic of Korea on May 10, 2022.[^25]

## Major Achievements

### Foreign Policy Initiatives

Yoon Suk-yeol's most significant achievements came in the realm of foreign policy, where he pursued an ambitious agenda centered on strengthening South Korea's alliance with the United States and repairing relations with Japan. His foreign policy platform emphasized closer alignment with the United States through a "comprehensive strategic alliance," representing a notable shift from his predecessor Moon Jae-in's approach.[^26] Yoon aligned South Korea more closely with the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy and expressed interest in joining the Quad multilateral regional cooperative initiative in phases, starting with working groups on vaccines, climate change, and emerging technologies.[^27]

One of Yoon's most notable foreign policy accomplishments was the unprecedented deepening of ties with Japan. He implemented what he called "future-oriented" diplomacy toward Tokyo, moving rapidly to repair relations that had been strained for decades over historical grievances related to Japan's colonial occupation of Korea.[^28] This effort facilitated enhanced trilateral security coordination with the United States and Japan. The historic Camp David summit in August 2023 marked a high point of this trilateral cooperation, with security and defense officials from the three countries meeting at least 80 times following the summit.[^29]

On April 28, 2023, Yoon became the first South Korean president in over a decade to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress, where he emphasized that "Our Alliance is an alliance of universal values. Freedom, human rights, and democracy are the very foundations of our bonds."[^30] This speech underscored his commitment to values-based diplomacy and closer alignment with Washington's strategic priorities in the Indo-Pacific region.

### Economic and Technological Policies

On the domestic front, Yoon's administration emphasized what it called a "private-sector-led economy," prioritizing market autonomy and dynamism as drivers of economic growth.[^31] The government declared fiscal austerity, asserting that government borrowing was inappropriate and that private investment should be encouraged instead.[^32] The Ministry of Economy and Finance announced in July 2022 plans to cut the maximum corporate tax rate from 25 percent to 22 percent, aiming to enhance corporate competitiveness.[^33]

Recognizing the strategic importance of advanced technology, the Yoon administration committed 4.5 trillion KRW to key strategic technologies such as semiconductors and quantum computing, with a specific allocation of 1 trillion KRW to the semiconductor industry.[^34] This investment reflected South Korea's determination to maintain its competitive edge in critical technology sectors amid intensifying global competition.

### Prosecutorial Legacy

Before his presidency, Yoon's achievements as a prosecutor defined his public image. His willingness to pursue corruption cases against the nation's most powerful figures—including two former presidents, major corporate leaders, and judicial officials—established him as a symbol of equal justice under law.[^35] These investigations cemented his reputation as someone who would not be intimidated by power or political pressure, a reputation that proved crucial to his electoral appeal among voters frustrated with perceived elite corruption.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Martial Law Crisis

The defining controversy of Yoon's presidency came on December 3, 2024, when at 22:23, he declared martial law for the first time in South Korea since 1980.[^36] Yoon accused the opposition of being an "anti-state den of criminals" and "trying to overthrow the free democracy" by impeaching members of his cabinet and blocking his budget plans.[^37] He cited the need to protect the country from "North Korean communist forces" and "antistate forces."[^38]

The declaration shocked the nation and international observers. At 01:02 on December 4, just hours after the declaration, 190 legislators unanimously passed a motion to lift martial law, despite military attempts to prevent the vote.[^39] At 04:30, Yoon and his cabinet lifted martial law, making it last only several hours.[^40] Subsequent investigations concluded that Yoon had plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power.[^41] Investigators also accused the former president and his military allies of ordering operations against North Korea in a deliberate bid to stoke tensions and justify his plans to declare martial law.[^42]

### Corruption and Influence-Peddling Scandals

Throughout his presidency, Yoon faced multiple corruption allegations centered around his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and their alleged influence-peddling activities. The scandal involved allegations that Yoon and Kim exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative People Power Party to select a specific candidate for a parliamentary by-election in 2022.[^43] Opposition parties alleged that Yoon provided political favors in return for free opinion polls, with recordings suggesting he asked a party committee to pick senior party member Kim Young-sun to run in the election.[^44]

Yoon was accused of being an accomplice when his wife allegedly received opinion polls worth 270 million won ($183,000) for free from a self-proclaimed power broker and when she allegedly accepted a painting worth 140 million won from a former prosecutor.[^45] Kim was separately linked to multiple corruption allegations, including claims that she received luxury gifts via a fortuneteller acting as an intermediary for a Unification Church official seeking business favors, and possible involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme tied to a local BMW dealership company.[^46]

In a historic first for South Korea, prosecutors conducted a court-approved raid on Yoon's private residence as part of an investigation into allegations of backroom deals and influence peddling.[^47] On May 1, 2025, Yoon was indicted for abuse of power.[^48] His wife, Kim Keon-hee, was arrested on August 12, 2025, on various graft charges including bribery, stock fraud, and accepting luxury gifts such as Chanel bags, a diamond necklace, and a high-value Van Cleef pendant.[^49]

### Democratic Backsliding and Academic Criticism

Yoon's presidency was marked by growing concerns about democratic erosion in South Korea. In 2024, the Swedish V-Dem Institute reported that under Yoon's administration, South Korea was dropping in its liberal democracy index and described Yoon as "South Korea's Donald Trump."[^50] More than 500 professors at Seoul National University, Yoon's alma mater, signed a statement demanding he resign, stating "Democracy has collapsed and regression and retrogression are serious in all areas" and "President Yoon must step down as soon as possible."[^51] Professors from Yonsei University wrote that "What the Yoon Suk Yeol administration showed us during the first half of his term was incompetence, irresponsibility and reckless use of power."[^52]

### Approval Ratings and Political Challenges

Yoon's presidency was characterized by historically low approval ratings. By late November 2024, his approval rating had sank to 19 percent, the lowest since his election in May 2022.[^53] In the April 2024 general election, the ruling People Power Party suffered a crushing defeat, winning only 108 seats in the National Assembly, severely limiting Yoon's ability to advance his legislative agenda.[^54]

### Controversial Policy Proposals

Yoon's domestic policy agenda generated significant controversy. His labor reform plan, which recommended pushing the current 52-hour workweek to up to 69 hours per week, faced widespread public backlash and was ultimately abandoned.[^55] Critics argued that such policies prioritized corporate interests over worker welfare and quality of life. Yoon also vetoed a special prosecutor bill investigating allegations of corruption related to himself and his wife, drawing criticism for appearing to protect himself from accountability.[^56]

---

## Personal Life

Yoon Suk-yeol married Kim Keon-hee in 2012 when she was a businesswoman heading an art exhibition company.[^57] According to a 2018 interview, Kim revealed she had known Yoon "for a long time," and after a shared acquaintance suggested they would be a good match, they married when Kim was 40 and Yoon was 52.[^58] The couple has no children.[^59]

Both Yoon and Kim are known animal lovers, owning six dogs and five cats.[^60] Among their pets were two Turkmen shepherd puppies gifted by Turkmenistan's President during their visit in June 2024.[^61] An advocate for animal rights, Kim worked to end dog meat consumption in South Korea, representing a generational shift in South Korean attitudes toward animal welfare.[^62]

Kim is the president of Covana Contents, a company that focuses on art exhibitions.[^63] Upon her husband's election as president-elect in March 2022, Kim stated that she preferred the term "President's Spouse" to "First Lady," reflecting a more modern approach to the role.[^64] However, critics in South Korea began describing her as the country's "Lady Macbeth," suggesting she wielded inappropriate influence over her husband's political decisions.[^65]

During Yoon's impeachment crisis and subsequent legal troubles, Kim's health reportedly deteriorated significantly. In January 2025, several officials at the presidential residence expressed concerns about her health, describing her as "looking worryingly emaciated" and noting she had turned "so thin that it worries [them]."[^66] Kim was hospitalized due to her deteriorating health in June 2025, being released on June 27, 2025.[^67]

Yoon's personality has been described as stubborn and uncompromising, traits that served him well as a prosecutor pursuing powerful criminals but proved problematic in the collaborative environment of democratic politics. His lack of political experience before becoming president was evident in his difficulty building coalitions and managing relationships with the opposition-controlled National Assembly.

## Legacy

### Unprecedented Downfall

Yoon Suk-yeol's legacy will forever be defined by his spectacular fall from power. On December 14, 2024, lawmakers impeached Yoon for acting unconstitutionally following his brief declaration of martial law.[^68] The Constitutional Court ruled to oust Yoon on April 4, 2025, in a unanimous 8–0 decision, with the verdict stating that "the respondent's unconstitutional and unlawful acts amount to a serious violation of law that cannot be tolerated from the perspective of constitutional protection, as they represent a betrayal of public trust."[^69]

Yoon became only the second Korean president to be removed from office through impeachment, following Park Geun-hye in 2017, who was also removed by a unanimous 8–0 decision.[^70] He served as president from May 10, 2022, to April 4, 2025, making him the shortest-serving directly elected president in South Korea's democratic history since 1987.[^71] After his removal from office, Yoon was arrested and formally indicted on charges of leading an insurrection, facing potential penalties including life imprisonment or the death penalty.[^72]

### Foreign Policy Achievements and Contradictions

Historians note that Yoon deserves credit for an unprecedented deepening of ties with Japan and for facilitating enhanced trilateral cooperation with the United States and Japan through the historic Camp David summit.[^73] However, scholars also observe that "his lofty rhetoric was never translated into meaningful action" and that "his rushed and politically misaligned push for reconciliation sparked public backlash, and any progress made is likely to be reversed by future administrations."[^74]

Yoon's approach to China—proclaiming "strategic clarity" and shifting away from "strategic ambiguity"—represented a significant recalibration of South Korea's foreign policy, though the long-term sustainability of this shift remains uncertain.[^75] His administration's efforts to position South Korea as a "global pivotal state" reflected ambitious middle-power diplomacy, but these aspirations were cut short by his domestic political collapse.[^76]

### Impact on South Korean Democracy

Despite any foreign policy accomplishments, analysts agree that Yoon Suk-yeol will primarily be remembered for weakening South Korea's democracy, polarizing society, and diminishing his party.[^77] Growing ideological competition, societal division, the politicization of civil-military interactions, and a decline in institutional confidence are identified as major manifestations of his legacy.[^78]

The impeachment process itself represented the longest and most intensely scrutinized presidential impeachment in South Korean history, with polling showing 57 percent supporting impeachment versus 37 percent opposing it.[^79] Some scholars argue that Yoon's impeachment and the unparalleled divisions across Korean society "must be seen by the left and the right as the last chance for South Korea to begin resetting its broken political system."[^80]

### Warnings for Future Leaders

Yoon's rapid rise from political novice to president and equally rapid fall serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of combining political inexperience with authoritarian tendencies in a mature democracy. His inability to work with an opposition-controlled legislature, his reliance on executive power rather than consensus-building, and his ultimate resort to martial law demonstrate the fragility of democratic norms when leaders lack commitment to democratic processes. The resilience of South Korea's democratic institutions—particularly the National Assembly's swift reversal of martial law and the Constitutional Court's firm application of constitutional principles—offers a counterpoint, suggesting that institutional checks can contain would-be authoritarians.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and some analysts credit Yoon Suk-yeol with important contributions to South Korea's international standing and security posture. Defenders argue that his strengthening of the U.S.-South Korea alliance came at a critical time when North Korea was accelerating its nuclear and missile programs and when China was becoming increasingly assertive in the region.[^81] His willingness to repair relations with Japan, despite domestic political costs, is seen by some as courageous statesmanship that prioritized national security over narrow political calculations.[^82]

Conservative supporters describe Yoon as a defender of "true freedom" against both domestic and foreign hostile forces.[^83] One pro-Yoon protester articulated this view: "I was taken aback by the president's martial law declaration at first, but I trusted that he made the declaration with good intentions. I believe the president when he says that our politics are rigged and is being driven by pro-North, anti-state forces."[^84]

Scholars analyzing Yoon's rhetorical strategies note that his emphasis on "Jayu" (freedom) represented a distinctive approach in South Korean presidential discourse, highlighting liberal democratic values in ways that differed from his predecessors.[^85] Some analysts appreciated his efforts to position South Korea as a "global pivotal state," arguing that this vision reflected South Korea's growing capabilities and responsibilities in international affairs.[^86]

Economic conservatives praised Yoon's commitment to fiscal discipline and private-sector-led growth, viewing his policies as necessary corrections to what they saw as excessive government intervention under previous administrations.[^87] His investments in strategic technologies like semiconductors were seen as forward-thinking efforts to maintain South Korea's competitive advantages in critical industries.[^88]

Before his presidency, Yoon's prosecutorial career earned widespread respect for his willingness to pursue powerful figures regardless of political consequences. His investigations of former presidents Park Geun-hye and Lee Myung-bak were viewed by many as demonstrating that no one was above the law.[^89]

### Negative Views

Critics and most scholars offer far more damning assessments of Yoon's presidency and legacy. The overwhelming view is that Yoon fundamentally damaged South Korean democracy through his authoritarian tendencies, culminating in the unprecedented declaration of martial law.[^90] More than 500 professors at Seoul National University condemned his administration, stating that "Democracy has collapsed and regression and retrogression are serious in all areas."[^91]

The Swedish V-Dem Institute's characterization of Yoon as "South Korea's Donald Trump" reflects international concerns about democratic backsliding under his leadership.[^92] Scholars point to growing polarization, declining institutional trust, and the politicization of civil-military relations as negative aspects of his legacy that will persist long after his removal from office.[^93]

Critics argue that Yoon's foreign policy achievements were overstated and unsustainable. His approach to Japan, while producing short-term gains in trilateral cooperation with the United States, "sparked public backlash" due to insufficient consultation with domestic stakeholders and attention to historical justice concerns.[^94] Analysts note that "his lofty rhetoric was never translated into meaningful action," suggesting a gap between diplomatic showmanship and substantive achievement.[^95]

On domestic policy, Yoon is criticized for incompetence and ideological rigidity. His controversial proposal to extend the workweek to 69 hours was seen as tone-deaf to workers' concerns and contributed to his declining popularity.[^96] His economic policies prioritizing corporate interests over worker protections and social welfare were viewed as exacerbating inequality.[^97]

The corruption scandals involving Yoon and his wife fundamentally undermined his credibility, particularly given that he had built his political career on anti-corruption investigations. The irony of a former prosecutor general being investigated for influence-peddling and corruption was not lost on observers.[^98] Investigations revealing that Yoon had plotted martial law for over a year to eliminate political rivals paint a picture of calculated authoritarianism rather than a momentary lapse in judgment.[^99]

Yoon's extremely low approval ratings—reaching just 19 percent by November 2024—and his party's crushing defeat in the April 2024 legislative elections demonstrate that most South Koreans had lost confidence in his leadership well before the martial law crisis.[^100] His impeachment with strong public support (57 percent in favor) and the Constitutional Court's unanimous decision to remove him suggest broad consensus that his presidency had become untenable.[^101]

Perhaps most significantly, critics argue that Yoon's legacy represents a warning about the dangers of electing political novices to executive office without adequate vetting or consideration of their democratic commitments. His prosecutorial background, while impressive in its way, did not prepare him for the collaborative, consensus-building nature of democratic governance.[^102] His instincts toward unilateral action and his apparent belief in his own superior judgment—traits that may have served him as a prosecutor—proved disastrous when combined with presidential powers in a polarized political environment.
