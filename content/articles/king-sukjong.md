## Summary

King Sukjong (Yi Sun, 1661-1720) was the 19th monarch of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning for 46 years from 1674 to 1720.[^1] A brilliant and politically astute ruler who ascended the throne at age 13, Sukjong's reign was marked by intense factional conflicts, significant economic reforms including nationwide tax restructuring and currency standardization, and complex court intrigues involving multiple queens and royal consorts.[^2] His strategic manipulation of political factions—alternating power between Southerners, Westerners, Noron, and Soron groups—strengthened royal authority but resulted in bloody purges and political instability.[^3] Despite the turmoil, his era witnessed economic recovery, agricultural development, and the establishment of foundations that would lead to the prosperous reigns of his successors, Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Born on October 7, 1661 (the 15th day of the 8th lunar month in the lunar calendar), at Changdeok Palace in Hanseong (modern-day Seoul), Yi Sun was the only son of King Hyeonjong (r. 1659-1674) and Queen Myeongseong (1642-1683).[^5] His birth was particularly significant in the context of Joseon royal succession—he was one of only seven kings out of twenty-seven in the entire Joseon Dynasty who were firstborn sons of official queens, giving him indisputable legitimacy as heir to the throne.[^6] This secure succession status would prove crucial in establishing his later political authority.

Prince Yi Sun's early years were spent in the refined environment of the Joseon court, where he received a rigorous education befitting a crown prince. In 1667, at the tender age of six, he was formally designated Crown Prince Myeongbo, beginning his formal preparation for kingship.[^7] His education followed the traditional Confucian curriculum for royal princes, emphasizing classical Chinese texts, statecraft, history, and moral philosophy. Young Sukjong showed remarkable intelligence and aptitude for learning, qualities that would later manifest in his skillful political maneuvering.[^8]

The political environment of his childhood was shaped by the aftermath of the devastating Manchu invasions (1627 and 1636-1637) that had forced Joseon into a tributary relationship with the Qing Dynasty.[^9] This humiliation left deep scars on the Joseon elite and fostered a strong pro-Ming sentiment among the ruling class, a sentiment that would influence Sukjong's own political and cultural outlook. His father, King Hyeonjong, presided over a period of reconstruction and recovery, but factional tensions were already simmering beneath the surface of court politics.[^10]

When King Hyeonjong died in 1674, the thirteen-year-old crown prince ascended the throne as King Sukjong. Despite his youth, he demonstrated remarkable composure and political acumen from the very beginning of his reign.[^11] The young king immediately faced his first major crisis—the Royal Funeral Dispute (예송논쟁, Yesong Nonjaeng)—which concerned the appropriate mourning period for Queen Inseong, King Hyojong's widow. This seemingly minor ritualistic question masked deeper factional divisions between the Southern and Western factions.[^12]

Sukjong sided with the Southern faction's position that the mourning should last one year rather than nine months, as the Western faction argued.[^13] This decision had profound political consequences—it demonstrated that even at age thirteen, Sukjong was willing to make decisive choices and was not merely a puppet of court officials. In 1675, he ordered the execution of Yun Hyu, a prominent Western faction leader, for opposing his decision, sending a clear message about royal authority that would characterize his entire reign.[^14]

## Rise to Power

Though Sukjong technically held supreme power from the moment of his coronation in 1674, his true consolidation of authority evolved over the first decade of his reign as he mastered the complex dynamics of factional politics.[^15] The young monarch quickly recognized that the intense rivalry between the Southerners (Namin) and Westerners (Seoin) could be exploited to strengthen royal prerogatives—a strategy known as tangpyeong, or impartial governance through balanced factionalism.[^16]

The Gyeongsin Hwanguk (경신환국) of 1680 marked Sukjong's first major political reversal. After six years of Southern faction dominance following the funeral dispute, Sukjong abruptly shifted his support to the Western faction.[^17] Southern faction leaders Heo Jeok and Yun Hyu were accused of treason, executed, and the entire faction was purged from government positions. This dramatic turnabout demonstrated Sukjong's willingness to ruthlessly eliminate political opponents and his belief that no single faction should become too powerful.[^18]

The political landscape became even more complex after 1680, when the Western faction itself split into two groups: the Noron (Old Doctrine) faction, which supported the hardline neo-Confucian scholar Song Si-yeol, and the Soron (Young Doctrine) faction, which opposed Song's rigid interpretation of Confucian principles.[^19] Sukjong skillfully played these factions against each other, preventing any single group from monopolizing power and ensuring that court officials remained dependent on royal favor rather than factional loyalty alone.[^20]

Personal matters intersected with politics in ways that would define Sukjong's reign. His first queen, Queen Ingyeong of the Kim clan, died of smallpox in 1680 at age twenty after bearing three daughters who all died in childbirth.[^21] After a year of mourning, Sukjong married Queen Inhyeon of the Yeoheung Min clan in 1681. However, Queen Inhyeon failed to produce a male heir, creating a succession crisis that would have profound political ramifications.[^22]

In the early 1680s, Sukjong became infatuated with Jang Ok-jeong, an exceptionally beautiful palace woman who would become known to history as Lady Jang Hui-bin.[^23] Contemporary records describe her as "exceedingly beautiful," "flirtatious and seductive," with charm that was notable even in the official Joseon Annals—an unusual acknowledgment in typically austere court records.[^24] In 1688, Lady Jang bore Sukjong his first son, Yi Yun (later King Gyeongjong), which dramatically shifted the political balance.[^25]

The birth of a potential heir to a concubine rather than the official queen created the perfect catalyst for Sukjong's most dramatic political maneuver. In 1689, when the Western faction opposed naming Lady Jang's son as crown prince, arguing it would undermine Queen Inhyeon's position, Sukjong responded with the Gisa Hwanguk (기사환국), a complete political reversal.[^26] He deposed Queen Inhyeon, elevated Lady Jang to queen status, named her infant son crown prince, and executed or exiled Western faction leaders, including the venerated Song Si-yeol, who was forced to drink poison.[^27] The Southern faction, which supported Lady Jang, returned to power after nine years of exile.[^28]

This bold series of actions demonstrated that Sukjong had fully come into his own as a political operator. By manipulating personal relationships, succession politics, and factional rivalries, he had achieved complete mastery over the court, proving that royal authority could override even the most powerful aristocratic factions when wielded with sufficient skill and ruthlessness.[^29]

## Major Achievements

Despite the political turbulence that characterized his reign, King Sukjong presided over substantial economic, administrative, and foreign policy achievements that laid the groundwork for the later prosperity of the Joseon Dynasty.[^30]

### Economic and Tax Reform

Sukjong's most significant accomplishment was the nationwide implementation of the Daedongbeop (대동법, Uniform Land Tax Law), which fundamentally transformed Joseon's taxation system.[^31] Before this reform, provinces were required to deliver specific local tribute goods to the central government—a system that was burdensome for farmers, created opportunities for corruption in transport and collection, and provided unstable revenue for the state.[^32] The Daedongbeop replaced this with a standardized levy primarily paid in grain or cloth per household, calculated based on land ownership rather than household or regional specialties.[^33]

While the Daedongbeop had been introduced in limited regions during previous reigns, it was during Sukjong's rule that the system was expanded and applied comprehensively across the entire kingdom for the first time.[^34] This reform substantially alleviated peasant hardships, reduced administrative corruption, stabilized state revenues, and contributed to post-war economic recovery following the devastating invasions of the previous century.[^35] The regime improvement eased the tax burden on ordinary people while still securing sufficient resources for state affairs, demonstrating Sukjong's commitment to both fiscal stability and popular welfare.[^36]

### Currency Reform and Monetary Policy

In 1678, just four years into his reign, Sukjong initiated a groundbreaking currency reform by issuing the Sangpyeongtongbo (상평통보) coins, establishing the first government-mandated bronze currency for nationwide circulation in Korean history.[^37] Prior to this, Joseon had relied primarily on a barter economy supplemented by limited use of Chinese coins and cloth currency. The Sangpyeongtongbo became Korea's first true standardized currency and would remain in continuous use for almost 200 years, making it the longest-used currency in Korean history.[^38]

The coins were minted in different regions across the kingdom, with slight design variations depending on the minting location—nearly 3,000 different varieties have been identified by numismatists.[^39] This currency reform facilitated commercial development, enabled more efficient tax collection under the Daedongbeop system, and supported the growth of a market economy. The establishment of a stable monetary system was a crucial step in Joseon's economic modernization and contributed to the commercial prosperity that characterized the later eighteenth century.[^40]

### Administrative Reforms

Sukjong implemented significant liberalization of civil service rules, promoting members of the middle class (jungin) and children of concubines into higher-ranking regional government positions.[^41] This meritocratic expansion of bureaucratic recruitment broke down some of the rigid status barriers that had previously limited social mobility and administrative efficiency. By drawing on a broader talent pool, Sukjong's government could staff provincial offices more effectively and reduce the monopoly that aristocratic families held over government appointments.[^42]

### Foreign Policy and Border Definition

In 1712, Sukjong's government successfully negotiated with the Qing Dynasty to formally define the borders between Joseon and Qing territory at the Yalu River and Tumen River.[^43] This border demarcation provided diplomatic clarity and reduced potential conflicts over territorial jurisdiction. While Joseon remained a tributary state to Qing, establishing clear boundaries was an important assertion of Joseon's territorial integrity and administrative sovereignty within its recognized borders.[^44]

Additionally, in 1696, Sukjong's government secured Japanese recognition of Ulleungdo (Ulleung Island) as Joseon territory, resolving a longstanding dispute over sovereignty of the island.[^45] This diplomatic success protected Korean territorial claims and demonstrated effective foreign policy management despite Joseon's position between two powerful neighbors.

### Agricultural and Cultural Development

Sukjong's reign witnessed substantial agricultural development in remote provinces, expanding cultivated land and improving productivity through government-supported irrigation projects and agricultural extension programs.[^46] Increased agricultural output supported population growth and provided the economic foundation for cultural flourishing.

The period also saw increased cultural activity, including significant publishing projects and literary production.[^47] Sukjong himself was an accomplished poet who used poetry to express his political philosophy and governance ideals. He composed poems inspired by paintings, maps, and astronomical charts, using these cultural artifacts to articulate his vision for the kingdom.[^48] His poetry revealed his commitment to learning, acceptance of loyal advice, and emphasis on virtue in governance.[^49]

### Foundation for Future Prosperity

While Sukjong's reign was marked by intense factional conflict, the economic and administrative foundations he established ultimately enabled the flourishing of the late Joseon Dynasty under his successors.[^50] Historians credit his reforms with laying the groundwork for the reigns of Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo—considered the apex of Joseon culture and governance—even if Sukjong himself did not fully resolve the factional strife that plagued his court.[^51]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

King Sukjong's reign, despite its achievements, was marked by severe controversies that have led many historians to view his rule as deeply problematic and his political tactics as ultimately damaging to Joseon's long-term stability.[^52]

### Weaponization of Factional Politics

Sukjong's most significant failure was his systematic manipulation of factional rivalries through a strategy of hwanguk (환국, "reversal of fortunes"), whereby he would abruptly withdraw support from one faction and empower their rivals, resulting in wholesale political purges.[^53] While Sukjong believed this would strengthen royal authority by preventing any single faction from becoming too powerful, the actual result was a series of bloody political massacres that decimated the intellectual and administrative elite.[^54]

The hwanguk incidents—particularly the Gisa Hwanguk of 1689 and the Gapsul Hwanguk of 1694—resulted in the execution, exile, or forced suicide of hundreds of scholars, officials, and their family members.[^55] These purges destroyed entire lineages of educated officials who had dedicated their lives to state service. The veteran neo-Confucian scholar Song Si-yeol, who had served multiple kings and was revered as one of the greatest minds of his era, was forced to drink poison in 1689 at age 83 simply because his faction opposed Sukjong's personal desires regarding succession.[^56]

### Paralysis of Government Administration

Far from strengthening royal authority in the long term, Sukjong's factional manipulations created a climate of fear, suspicion, and paralysis within the bureaucracy.[^57] Officials could never be certain whether their current favor would protect them from future purges, leading to risk-averse behavior, reluctance to offer frank counsel, and prioritization of factional loyalty over competent governance. The rigid factionalism that characterized Sukjong's reign gradually paralyzed effective administration and established patterns of political revenge that would plague Joseon for generations.[^58]

### The Queen Deposition Scandal

Sukjong's treatment of his queens and consorts revealed a willingness to subordinate institutional norms and human dignity to personal desires and political expedience.[^59] The deposition of Queen Inhyeon in 1689 was unprecedented in its brazenness—Sukjong stripped the legitimate queen of her title, exiled her and her family (some of whom were executed), and elevated his concubine Lady Jang to queen simply because she had borne him a son and was supported by his currently favored political faction.[^60]

This action shocked contemporary observers and violated fundamental Confucian principles regarding the sanctity of ritual propriety and the respect due to legitimate queens.[^61] When Sukjong reversed course in 1694, deposing Lady Jang (now Queen Jang) and reinstating Queen Inhyeon, it became clear that both women were merely pawns in Sukjong's political games with the factions.[^62] Lady Jang was eventually executed by forced poisoning in 1701 after being accused of using sorcery to curse Queen Inhyeon, though many historians suspect the charges were politically motivated.[^63]

### Instrumentalization of Women

The king's relationships with his three queens and multiple consorts reflected a pattern of using women as political instruments rather than treating them as individuals with dignity.[^64] Queen Inhyeon suffered deposition and exile; Lady Jang was elevated and then executed; Queen Inwon, his third wife married in 1702, was childless and essentially a placeholder.[^65] The treatment of these women set disturbing precedents and demonstrated the dangerous intersection of personal desire, political manipulation, and absolute power.

### Long-Term Factional Damage

The Southern faction never recovered from the purge of 1694, effectively removing one of the major political traditions from Joseon politics and narrowing the diversity of political thought in the kingdom.[^66] Meanwhile, the split between Noron and Soron within the Western faction became increasingly bitter, with these groups continuing to feud violently into subsequent reigns. The factional hatred intensified during Sukjong's rule would contribute directly to the succession crisis after his death and the controversy surrounding his son King Gyeongjong's brief, troubled reign.[^67]

### Succession Complications

Sukjong's complex marital and succession arrangements created lasting problems. His eldest son Yi Yun (King Gyeongjong), born to the disgraced and executed Lady Jang, reigned for only four years and faced constant legitimacy challenges from Noron faction members who supported his half-brother, Prince Yeoning (later King Yeongjo), son of Sukbin Choe, a consort of extremely low social status.[^68] These succession tensions resulted in further purges and instability that plagued the early eighteenth century.[^69]

### Qing Relations Friction

Sukjong's frequent health issues (some historians suspect political theater) led him to repeatedly avoid the ritual of personally greeting Qing envoys when they arrived in Joseon—a serious breach of tributary protocol.[^70] By 1686, the Qing court was openly criticizing Sukjong's "usual unfaithful ritual of greeting envoys," creating diplomatic tensions that could have escalated into serious conflict had the Qing chosen to respond more forcefully.[^71] This behavior reflected poorly on Joseon's diplomatic reliability and demonstrated Sukjong's willingness to risk foreign relations for personal convenience.

## Personal Life

King Sukjong's personal life was extraordinarily complex, characterized by multiple marriages, numerous consorts, succession intrigues, and relationships that were inextricably intertwined with political machinations.[^72]

### Marriages and Queens

Sukjong had three official queens during his lifetime, an unusually high number reflecting the turbulent personal and political circumstances of his reign.[^73]

His first wife, **Queen Ingyeong** of the Gwangsan Kim clan (1661-1680), was married to Sukjong while he was still crown prince and became queen when he ascended the throne in 1674.[^74] She bore three daughters, but tragically all died during childbirth or shortly thereafter. At age twenty, Queen Ingyeong contracted smallpox and died within eight days in 1680, leaving the young king without an heir.[^75]

Following a year of mourning, Sukjong married **Queen Inhyeon** of the Yeoheung Min clan in 1681.[^76] Supported by the powerful Western faction, Queen Inhyeon was unable to produce an heir for the throne, which became a source of political vulnerability. In 1689, Sukjong shocked the court by deposing her, stripping her of the queen title, and exiling her when the Western faction opposed his designation of Lady Jang's son as crown prince.[^77] Five years later, in the Gapsul Hwanguk of 1694, Sukjong reversed course again, reinstating Queen Inhyeon to her former position after purging the Southern faction that had supported Lady Jang.[^78] Queen Inhyeon died in 1701, still childless, reportedly devastated by the years of political turmoil and humiliation she had endured.[^79]

In 1702, Sukjong married for the third time. **Queen Inwon** of the Gyeongju Kim clan (1687-1757) became queen at age fifteen.[^80] She was also childless and adopted both of Sukjong's surviving sons—Crown Prince Yi Yun (King Gyeongjong) and Prince Yeoning (King Yeongjo)—as her own.[^81] Queen Inwon outlived Sukjong by 37 years, surviving into the reign of her adopted son Yeongjo and dying at age 70, making her one of the longest-lived Korean queens.[^82]

### Royal Consorts

Beyond his three queens, Sukjong had multiple royal consorts, three of whom are particularly significant in historical records.[^83]

**Royal Noble Consort Hui (Jang Hui-bin)**, also known as Jang Ok-jeong (1659-1701), was the most famous and controversial figure in Sukjong's personal life.[^84] Entering the palace as a palace woman in the early 1680s, she captured the king's heart with her exceptional beauty and charm. Historical records describe her as possibly "the most beautiful woman in Joseon," with a flirtatious and seductive nature that entranced the king.[^85] In 1688, she bore Sukjong's first son, Crown Prince Yi Yun (later King Gyeongjong), dramatically changing her status and the political landscape.[^86]

Sukjong elevated her to queen in 1689, deposing Queen Inhyeon in the process—an unprecedented action that scandalized the court.[^87] However, in 1694, when political winds shifted again, she was demoted back to her previous consort status. In 1701, she was accused of using witchcraft and sorcery to curse Queen Inhyeon and was executed by forced poisoning.[^88] Her dramatic life story has been the subject of numerous Korean historical dramas, novels, and cultural works, cementing her place as one of the most notorious figures in Joseon history.[^89]

**Sukbin Choe** of the Haeju Choe clan (1670-1718) was one of the best-known consorts of King Sukjong and the biological mother of King Yeongjo, who would become one of Joseon's greatest monarchs.[^90] Her background was extraordinary—she belonged to the cheonmin (천민), the lowest social class in rigidly hierarchical Joseon society, and worked as a musuri (무수리), a lowly water maid in the palace.[^91] Despite her humble origins, she bore Prince Yeoning (Yi Geum) in 1694, who was recognized as a child prodigy and eventually became King Yeongjo.[^92] Her son's brilliance and later success as king elevated her posthumous reputation, though during her lifetime she faced discrimination due to her low birth.[^93]

### Children

Sukjong fathered three sons and six daughters through his consorts.[^94]

His first son, **Crown Prince Yi Yun** (1688-1724), born to Lady Jang, was designated heir apparent in 1689 despite fierce Western faction opposition.[^95] He became King Gyeongjong upon Sukjong's death in 1720 but reigned for only four turbulent years before dying at age 36 without an heir, possibly poisoned according to some historical theories.[^96]

His second son, **Prince Yeoning** (Yi Geum, 1694-1776), born to Sukbin Choe, was known from childhood as a prodigy with exceptional intelligence and learning.[^97] Despite his mother's low social status, he succeeded his half-brother as King Yeongjo and ruled for 52 years, becoming one of the longest-reigning and most accomplished monarchs in Korean history.[^98] The factional support for the two princes—Soron backed Gyeongjong while Noron supported Yeoning—created succession tensions that persisted throughout both their lives.[^99]

### Personality and Character

Historical sources describe Sukjong as exceptionally intelligent, politically astute, and decisive even from a young age.[^100] When Western faction leader Song Si-yeol opposed him during the funeral dispute, the fourteen-year-old king sent Song into exile and later ordered his execution by poison, demonstrating he was "not afraid to make big decisions and lead with confidence" despite his youth.[^101]

Sukjong was interested in Chinese history and culture, particularly admiring the loyalty of Guan Yu, the famous general from the Three Kingdoms period.[^102] He wrote poetry inspired by paintings of Guanwang (the deified Guan Yu), expressing his hope that such loyalty and virtue would protect Joseon.[^103] His cultural interests reflected a traditional Confucian education combined with artistic sensibility.

However, Sukjong's personality also exhibited concerning traits—a tendency toward manipulation, a willingness to sacrifice individuals for political expedience, and an apparent belief that rapid, violent political reversals would strengthen rather than undermine the monarchy.[^104] His treatment of the women in his life suggests he viewed personal relationships primarily through a political lens, using marriage and favor as tools of statecraft rather than sources of genuine human connection.[^105]

---

## Legacy

King Sukjong's legacy is deeply contested among historians, with his 46-year reign viewed simultaneously as a period of important economic reform and disastrous political instability.[^106]

### Economic and Administrative Foundations

Sukjong's most enduring positive legacy lies in the economic and administrative reforms that created foundations for later prosperity.[^107] The nationwide implementation of the Daedongbeop tax system and the establishment of the Sangpyeongtongbo currency were genuine achievements that benefited the kingdom for generations.[^108] The reign of King Sukjong was "a very meaningful era in Joseon's economic history because it was a time when Joseon's national power, which had been reduced by war, was almost restored, agricultural productivity developed dramatically, a currency circulation economy was established, and the Daedongbeop was implemented nationwide."[^109]

These reforms stabilized state finances, reduced corruption in tax collection, alleviated peasant burdens, and facilitated the development of a commercial economy.[^110] Historians credit these foundations with enabling the cultural and political flourishing under Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo in the late eighteenth century, often called the "Joseon Renaissance."[^111]

### Political Devastation

Conversely, Sukjong's political legacy is largely negative. His reign was marked by "some of the most intense factional fights in the Joseon dynasty," with bloody hwanguk purges that killed hundreds of officials and scholars.[^112] Rather than strengthening royal authority in the long term, these violent political reversals created a climate of fear, instability, and revenge that "gradually paralyzed the bureaucracy" and established destructive patterns that persisted for generations.[^113]

The Southern faction was effectively destroyed as a political force after the Gapsul Hwanguk of 1694, while the Noron-Soron split became increasingly bitter and violent.[^114] This narrowing of political discourse and intensification of factional hatred directly contributed to the succession crisis and political turmoil that followed Sukjong's death.[^115]

### Royal Authority Paradox

Sukjong succeeded in demonstrating powerful royal authority during his lifetime—"the fact that Sukjong had no problems with certain actions is proof that he had strong royal authority."[^116] As the only son of King Hyeonjong and Queen Myeongseong, he possessed "secure legitimacy" as "the indisputable successor to the throne," which gave him confidence to act decisively.[^117]

However, the methods he used to assert this authority—manipulating factions, conducting bloody purges, deposing queens, and creating a climate of fear—ultimately weakened rather than strengthened the institution of the monarchy. His son Gyeongjong faced constant legitimacy challenges and factional opposition, while his grandson Yeongjo spent much of his long reign trying to heal the factional divisions that Sukjong's tactics had exacerbated.[^118]

### Cultural Memory and Historical Representation

In Korean cultural memory, Sukjong is most remembered for the dramatic circumstances surrounding the Gi-Sa Hwanguk dispute involving Queen Inhyeon and Lady Jang Hui-bin.[^119] This love-triangle-turned-political-catastrophe has been the subject of countless novels, plays, films, and television dramas, cementing Sukjong's place in popular consciousness as a king whose personal passions drove political chaos.[^120]

Interestingly, nineteenth-century folk narratives and vernacular Korean novels present a romanticized image of Sukjong's reign "as being peaceful and all his subjects living in comfort," suggesting that popular memory focused more on the economic stability and less on the court intrigues that dominated elite political life.[^121] This divergence between elite historical records and popular memory reflects different experiences of Sukjong's rule—for ordinary people, tax reform and economic development may have been more significant than factional battles among aristocrats.[^122]

### Reassessment of Royal Legitimacy

Sukjong actively worked to promote his own legitimacy by reassessing the achievements of King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon Dynasty, and "through such efforts promoted his own legacy as the restoring monarch of the royal court."[^123] This suggests Sukjong was conscious of crafting his historical image and saw himself as a monarch who restored royal prerogatives that had been eroded by aristocratic factionalism.[^124]

### Enabling Future Greatness

Perhaps the most paradoxical aspect of Sukjong's legacy is that despite his political failures, the reforms he implemented and the very succession complications he created produced one of Joseon's greatest kings—his son Yeongjo, born to a palace maid, who ruled for 52 years and implemented crucial political reforms including the tangpyeong (impartial governance) policy that finally began to heal factional divisions.[^125] In this sense, Sukjong's reign, "although he had these limitations, was significant as it ultimately laid the foundation for the late Joseon Dynasty's revival period, the King Yeongjo and Jeongjo eras."[^126]

---

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who emphasize Sukjong's economic and administrative achievements view him as a capable, intelligent reformer who guided Joseon through a crucial period of recovery and modernization.[^127] His implementation of the Daedongbeop nationwide is recognized as one of the most significant tax reforms in Korean history, comparable in importance to similar reforms in Ming and Qing China.[^128] Economic historians note that "King Sukjong's reigning period was a time of recovery and development," during which "the nation's tax regime was improved to ease the burden of the people, while still securing enough for state affairs."[^129]

The establishment of the Sangpyeongtongbo currency system is praised as a crucial step toward economic modernization, facilitating commercial development and marking Joseon's transition from a primarily barter economy to a monetary economy.[^130] That this currency remained in use for nearly 200 years demonstrates the soundness of the monetary policy implemented during Sukjong's reign.[^131]

Defenders of Sukjong's political tactics argue that his factional manipulations, while brutal, were necessary to prevent any single aristocratic group from monopolizing power and reducing the king to a mere figurehead.[^132] From this perspective, the hwanguk reversals demonstrated that the king, not the factions, held ultimate authority, which was essential for maintaining the monarchical system against aristocratic encroachment.[^133] Some scholars note that "Sukjong was a skilled legislator who caused multiple changes in political power throughout his reign," suggesting his political maneuvering reflected genuine strategic skill rather than mere caprice.[^134]

Sukjong's cultural patronage and personal literary accomplishments are also noted positively. His poetry revealed sophisticated political philosophy, with verses expressing that "if a King cultivates virtue, his country will reach a happy occasion and if a King neglects, disaster will occur," demonstrating his awareness of Confucian principles of virtuous governance.[^135] His patronage of scholarship and publishing contributed to the cultural vitality of the period.[^136]

The longevity of Sukjong's reign—46 years—provided stability in the sense of consistent leadership, and the fact that he "presided over a period of relative peace and prosperity" in terms of external relations and economic development is sometimes emphasized.[^137] Unlike some of his predecessors who faced invasions or coups, Sukjong maintained the kingdom's territorial integrity and avoided major external conflicts.[^138]

Some revisionist historians argue that traditional accounts exaggerate the negative aspects of factional conflict during Sukjong's reign, pointing out that "many facts related to King Sukjong's accomplishments and ruling tactics are misrepresented in movies and dramas," and that contemporary folk literature suggests ordinary people experienced his reign as generally prosperous and stable.[^139] This suggests the political violence, while real, may have been more limited to elite circles than comprehensive historical narratives sometimes imply.[^140]

### Negative Views

Critics of Sukjong's reign focus on the devastating political instability he created and the long-term damage to Joseon's governance structures.[^141] His systematic manipulation of factions through hwanguk reversals is condemned as "resulting in bloody killings between factions" that destroyed lives, eliminated talented officials, and created a climate of fear and paralysis within the bureaucracy.[^142]

The execution of Song Si-yeol, one of the most respected Confucian scholars of the era, at age 83 for opposing the king's personal desires regarding succession is cited as emblematic of Sukjong's willingness to sacrifice principle and merit for political expedience.[^143] Critics argue that rather than strengthening royal authority, these purges demonstrated that Sukjong placed personal power above institutional stability and Confucian principles of governance.[^144]

Sukjong's treatment of his queens and consorts is viewed as deeply problematic, reflecting authoritarian abuse of power and instrumentalization of women for political purposes.[^145] The deposition of Queen Inhyeon in 1689 "shocked contemporary observers and violated fundamental Confucian principles regarding the sanctity of ritual propriety," while the elevation and subsequent execution of Lady Jang demonstrated that both women were "merely pawns in Sukjong's political games."[^146]

Historians critical of Sukjong note that his belief that "political factions would weaken the king's power" and his consequent strategy of "rapid reversals of the ruling faction" revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of how stable governance functions.[^147] Rather than preventing any faction from becoming too powerful, his actions intensified factional hatred, created cycles of revenge, and ensured that each faction, when in power, would ruthlessly eliminate their opponents before they could be eliminated themselves.[^148]

The long-term consequences of Sukjong's political tactics are seen in the troubled reigns of his immediate successors. King Gyeongjong faced constant legitimacy challenges and died after only four years, possibly assassinated; the early years of King Yeongjo's reign were marked by violent factional conflict and the Rebellion of Yi Injwa (1728), which was directly connected to Noron-Soron tensions that had intensified during Sukjong's time.[^149] It would take decades of deliberate effort by Yeongjo and Jeongjo to repair the damage Sukjong's factional manipulations had caused.[^150]

Some scholars argue that Sukjong's economic reforms, while beneficial, were continuations or completions of policies developed by previous administrations rather than original innovations, and that crediting Sukjong personally overlooks the contributions of his ministers and the groundwork laid by earlier kings.[^151] From this perspective, Sukjong's economic legacy is less a matter of brilliant personal achievement and more a function of being in power at the right time to implement long-developing reforms.[^152]

The diplomatic tensions with the Qing Dynasty resulting from Sukjong's frequent avoidance of envoy-greeting rituals are cited as evidence of his willingness to risk Joseon's external security for personal convenience, demonstrating poor judgment and irresponsible statecraft.[^153]

Ultimately, critics view Sukjong as an intelligent but fundamentally flawed ruler whose personal political skill masked deeper failures of wisdom, restraint, and long-term strategic thinking.[^154] While he successfully maintained his personal power for 46 years, he left the kingdom with intensified factional hatred, weakened administrative institutions, and succession complications that would plague Joseon for generations to come.[^155]
