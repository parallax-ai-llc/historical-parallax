## Summary

Triệu Đà (趙佗; Chinese: Zhao Tuo; c. 240–137 BC), also known as Emperor Wu of Nanyue, was a Chinese general of the Qin dynasty who founded the independent kingdom of Nanyue in 204 BC following the collapse of the Qin Empire.[^1] Born in Zhengding, Hebei in northern China, he participated in the Qin conquest of the Baiyue peoples and later established a kingdom that encompassed modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam.[^2] His 93-year reign remains one of the longest in world history, and his legacy continues to provoke intense debate among Vietnamese and Chinese historians regarding his status as either a founding father or foreign invader.[^3][^4]

## Early Life and Background

Zhao Tuo was born around 240 BC in Zhengding (modern-day Zhengding County, Hebei Province) in northern China during the late Warring States period.[^5] Little is known about his family background, though he emerged from the northern Chinese state of Zhao. When the state of Zhao was defeated and annexed by Qin in 222 BC, the young Zhao Tuo joined the Qin military forces, serving as one of their generals in their ambitious southern campaigns.[^6]

Around 219 BC, Zhao Tuo was dispatched southward as part of the Qin dynasty's massive military campaign against the Baiyue peoples, a collective term for various indigenous tribes inhabiting what is now southern China and northern Vietnam.[^7] This campaign, ordered by Emperor Qin Shi Huang, involved an army of 500,000 soldiers and represented one of the Qin Empire's most ambitious territorial expansions. The campaign faced fierce resistance from the southern Yue tribes, who employed devastating guerrilla warfare tactics against the unfamiliar Qin forces, resulting in the death of Qin commander Tu Sui and casualties exceeding 10,000 men.[^8]

Despite these initial setbacks, by 214 BC the territories of Guangdong, Guangxi, and possibly northern Vietnam were subjugated and annexed into the Qin Empire.[^9] The conquered territory was divided into three commanderies: Guilin, Nanhai, and Xiang. Zhao Tuo distinguished himself during these campaigns and was appointed magistrate of Longchuan and later commander of Nanhai Commandery, demonstrating his military prowess and administrative capabilities.[^10]

Before the fall of the Qin dynasty, Zhao Tuo's military commander Ren Xiao, sensing the impending collapse of the empire, advised him not to get involved in the chaos consuming central China. Instead, Ren Xiao counseled Zhao Tuo to establish his own independent kingdom centered around the geographically remote and strategically defensible city of Panyu (modern Guangzhou).[^11] This prescient advice would prove crucial to Zhao Tuo's future success as an independent ruler.

## Rise to Power

As the Qin dynasty began to collapse in 206 BC following peasant rebellions and internal strife, Zhao Tuo seized the opportunity to consolidate his power base in the south.[^12] Using one excuse or another, he systematically eliminated Qin-appointed officials and replaced them with his own appointees, establishing a loyal power structure independent from the crumbling central authority.[^13]

By the time the Qin fell completely, Zhao Tuo had successfully conquered the neighboring provinces of Guilin and Xiang, bringing them under his control.[^14] In 204 BC, he formally proclaimed himself King Wu of Nanyue (Emperor Wu of the Southern Yue), establishing an independent kingdom that encompassed the modern Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Hong Kong, Macau, southern Fujian, and central to northern Vietnam.[^15]

The establishment of Nanyue represented not merely a military achievement but also a sophisticated political calculation. Zhao Tuo positioned his new kingdom as a buffer state between the emerging Han dynasty in the north and the indigenous kingdoms of Southeast Asia to the south. This strategic positioning would define much of Nanyue's foreign policy for decades to come.

In June or July 196 BC, Emperor Gaozu of Han, the founder of the Han dynasty, dispatched the diplomat Lu Jia to negotiate with Zhao Tuo.[^16] The resulting agreement recognized Zhao Tuo as the legitimate king of Nanyue in return for his nominal submission to the Han Empire. This arrangement allowed legal trade between the Han Empire and Nanyue, particularly benefiting the Nanyue people who were anxious to purchase iron vessels from China. Emperor Gaozu was reportedly much pleased by this diplomatic resolution, which secured the southern frontier without military conflict.[^17]

However, Zhao Tuo's relationship with the Han dynasty was never entirely submissive. Before reaching this diplomatic accord, he had ruled Nanyue autonomously, committed acts of defiance against Emperor Gaozu, severed all ties with the Han dynasty, killed many Han-appointed officials, and favored local Yue customs over Chinese practices.[^18] Although formally a Han subject state, Nanyue retained a large measure of de facto autonomy, and Zhao Tuo walked a careful diplomatic tightrope between nominal vassalage and practical independence.[^19]

## Major Achievements

### Military Campaigns and Territorial Expansion

Zhao Tuo's military achievements extended well beyond the initial founding of Nanyue. After the death of Emperor Gaozu, relations between Nanyue and the Han dynasty deteriorated significantly during the regency of Empress Lü. In 185 BC, Empress Lü's officials outlawed trade in iron and horses with Nanyue, severing the commercial ties that had stabilized relations between the two states.[^20] Zhao Tuo protested vehemently, complaining that "Emperor Gaozu set me up as a feudal lord and sent his envoy giving me permission to carry on trade," but that "Empress Lu...[is] treating me like one of the barbarians and breaking off our trade in iron vessels and goods."[^21]

In retaliation, Zhao Tuo proclaimed himself emperor of Nanyue in 185 BC—a direct challenge to Han authority—and launched a military attack on the neighboring kingdom of Changsha, successfully taking several border towns.[^22] In 181 BC, Empress Lü dispatched General Zhou Zao with an army to attack Nanyue, but the campaign ended in complete failure as the heat and dampness caused many of his officers and men to fall ill, preventing them from crossing the mountains into Nanyue territory.[^23]

Following the death of Empress Lü in 180 BC, Zhao Tuo embarked on his most significant territorial expansion. He used his troops to menace neighboring kingdoms and his wealth to bribe them into submission.[^24] Around 179 BC, Zhao Tuo successfully conquered the kingdom of Âu Lạc, ruled by King An Dương Vương (Thục Phán), bringing the Red River Delta of northern Vietnam under Nanyue control.[^25][^26]

According to Vietnamese legend, Zhao Tuo initially failed on the battlefield against An Dương Vương's forces. He then asked for a truce and sent his son Zhong Shi to serve King An Dương, where Zhong Shi fell in love with and married the king's daughter, Mỵ Châu. Zhong Shi allegedly discovered the secret of An Dương Vương's magical crossbow—a weapon said to confer political power—and sabotaged it, enabling Zhao Tuo to launch a successful attack that resulted in An Dương Vương's suicide.[^27][^28]

Zhao Tuo also began to menace the neighboring kingdoms of Minyue, Western Ou, and Luo, securing their submission and issuing edicts in a manner similar to the Han emperor, effectively acting as an independent sovereign rather than a vassal.[^29]

### Administrative Innovations and Governance

Zhao Tuo demonstrated considerable administrative acumen in organizing his kingdom. After conquering Âu Lạc around 179-180 BC, he divided his expanded kingdom into administrative regions including Cửu Chân and Giao Chỉ, with the latter encompassing most of northern Vietnam.[^30] Rather than imposing direct central control, he allowed each region to have representatives to the central government, creating a relatively relaxed and decentralized administrative system while maintaining overall authority.[^31]

Crucially, Zhao Tuo incorporated the conquered regions into his Nanyue domain but left indigenous chiefs in control of the local population, with the former royal court at Cổ Loa (An Dương Vương's capital) continuing to function under Nanyue oversight.[^32] In areas of particular "complexity," Yue chieftains were often enfeoffed with great autonomy, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to governance that prioritized stability over centralization.[^33]

Because the Kingdom of Nanyue was established by Zhao Tuo, a Chinese general of the Qin dynasty, Nanyue's political and bureaucratic systems initially continued those of the Qin Empire.[^34] However, the ruling elite included both native Yue and immigrant Han peoples, creating a blended administrative framework unlike the ethnically homogeneous bureaucracies of either the Qin or Han dynasties.[^35]

### Cultural and Economic Policies

One of Zhao Tuo's most significant achievements was his innovative cultural policy that promoted bidirectional assimilation between Han Chinese and Yue peoples. Unlike Qin Shi Huang, who had imposed harsh Chinese cultural supremacy, Zhao Tuo respected Yue customs, rallied their local rulers, and allowed local chieftains to continue their traditional policies and political practices.[^36]

Under Zhao Tuo's leadership, Chinese immigrants were actively encouraged to adopt the customs of the Yue.[^37] This policy extended even to the royal family—traditional accounts suggest Zhao Tuo himself married a Vietnamese wife according to Yue customs and self-proclaimed as "Man Di the great elder," adopting elements of indigenous identity.[^38] Marriages between Han Chinese and Yue became increasingly common throughout Nanyue's existence, even occurring within the Zhao royal family, with many marriages recorded between the Zhao family (Han Chinese) and the Lü family (Yue).[^39]

Over time, the Yue gradually began holding more positions of authority in the government. Lü Jia, the last prime minister of Nanyue, was a Yue citizen, with over 70 of his kinsmen serving as officials in various parts of the government.[^40] This gradual integration of indigenous peoples into the governing apparatus represented a relatively progressive policy for its time.

Economically, Zhao Tuo transformed Nanyue into a major maritime trading power. The kingdom, located on the coast of the South China Sea with its capital in Panyu (Guangzhou), relied on its unique geographical location and convenient water transportation to become an important port and commodity distribution center.[^41] Nanyue actively expanded overseas trade and made Guangzhou an important node on the emerging Maritime Silk Road.[^42]

Archaeological evidence from the tomb of the second Nanyue king revealed extensive international trade connections. Artifacts include a silver box featuring "the chiseling technique popular in Persia and petal decorations common in West Asia," along with other West Asian-style objects, indicating that the Maritime Silk Road existed during Nanyue's era.[^43] During this period, spices, glass beads, and other trade products from Southeast Asia, South Asia, and West Asia began entering China through these maritime routes.[^44]

### Longevity and Political Stability

Perhaps Zhao Tuo's most remarkable achievement was the extraordinary longevity of his reign. By the time he died in 137 BC, he had ruled for more than 70 years and outlived his own sons, being succeeded by his grandson Zhao Mo.[^45] At his death, Zhao Tuo was approximately 103 years old—an extraordinary lifespan for ancient times—making his reign one of the longest in world history.[^46] His ability to maintain political stability, balance relations with the powerful Han dynasty, and integrate diverse ethnic populations for over seven decades stands as a testament to his political skill and adaptability.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Foreign Invader Debate

The most enduring controversy surrounding Zhao Tuo concerns his status in Vietnamese history: was he a founding father who established the foundation of Vietnamese statehood, or a foreign Chinese invader who conquered indigenous Vietnamese kingdoms? This debate has raged for centuries and continues to shape how Zhao Tuo is remembered in both Vietnam and China.[^47]

Starting in the 18th century, Vietnamese historians began questioning the traditional positive view of Zhao Tuo. Ngô Thì Sĩ (1726–1780), an influential Vietnamese scholar, argued that Zhao Tuo was a foreign invader based in Panyu (Guangzhou) who ruled the Red River Delta indirectly, and that Nanyue was a foreign dynasty like the Southern Han that should not be included in Vietnamese national history.[^48][^49] This represented a fundamental reevaluation of a figure who had been praised for centuries as Vietnam's first emperor.

The modern government of Vietnam has adopted this negative portrayal, depicting Zhao Tuo as a foreign invader who vanquished Vietnam's heroic King An Dương Vương.[^50] After World War II, this view became mainstream among Vietnamese historians in North Vietnam, and after reunification, it became the official state orthodoxy promoted by the ruling Vietnamese Communist Party.[^51] In this narrative, Nanyue was removed from Vietnamese national history, and Zhao Tuo was recast as a Chinese aggressor rather than a Vietnamese founding father.

This shift reflects complex questions about national identity and historical continuity. According to scholar John D. Phan, the narrative of "Vietnamese history and culture as one of a pre-Sinitic people 'surviving' long centuries of Chinese rule" that emerged unchanged is one born from modern nationalist ideology rather than historical reality.[^52] The controversy thus reveals how modern nationalism can reshape the interpretation of ancient history to serve contemporary political purposes.

### Conquest of Âu Lạc

Zhao Tuo's conquest of the Âu Lạc kingdom around 179 BC represents one of the most controversial aspects of his legacy. The Âu Lạc kingdom, ruled by An Dương Vương (Thục Phán), was an indigenous Vietnamese state that had united the Lạc Việt and Âu Việt peoples.[^53] Zhao Tuo's military campaign destroyed this independent Vietnamese kingdom and brought the Red River Delta under Chinese-influenced control.

The legendary account of this conquest, involving deception, betrayal, and the tragic romance between Zhao Tuo's son and An Dương Vương's daughter, has become a powerful symbol in Vietnamese culture of foreign treachery and the loss of independence.[^54] Whether viewed as historical fact or nationalistic legend, the story of Mỵ Châu and Trọng Thủy (Zhong Shi) embodies Vietnamese resentment toward what is perceived as Chinese aggression and manipulation.

Historical records show ambiguity about the conquest. The Records of the Grand Historian—China's authoritative ancient historical text—mentioned neither King An Dương nor Zhao Tuo's military conquest of Âu Lạc explicitly, stating only that after Empress Lü's death, Zhao Tuo used his troops to menace and his wealth to bribe various kingdoms including the Luo (Âu Lạc) into submission.[^55] This ambiguity has fueled centuries of historical debate about the nature and legitimacy of Zhao Tuo's expansion.

### Han Dynasty Relations and Political Opportunism

Critics also point to Zhao Tuo's opportunistic relationship with the Han dynasty as evidence of political duplicity. He alternately declared himself a Han vassal when it suited his purposes and proclaimed himself an independent emperor when circumstances allowed.[^56] This flexibility, while politically astute, can be viewed as unprincipled opportunism rather than principled statecraft.

During the reign of Emperor Gaozu, Zhao Tuo accepted vassal status and tribute relationships.[^57] However, when Empress Lü imposed trade restrictions, he immediately proclaimed himself emperor and launched military attacks on Han territories.[^58] After Empress Lü's death and the restoration of normal relations, he resumed his vassal status.[^59] This pattern of shifting allegiances, while effective in maintaining Nanyue's independence, demonstrated a pragmatic rather than consistent approach to foreign relations.

### Chinese Historical Criticisms

Even within Chinese historiography, Zhao Tuo has faced criticism. Chinese historians have generally denounced Nanyue as separatists from the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD), though they also sometimes praised Zhao Tuo's regime as a civilizing force bringing Chinese culture to the south.[^60]

A particularly strident denunciation was produced by the poet Qu Dajun in 1696, who praised Qin Shi Huang as a model of how to uphold the purity of Chinese culture and compared Zhao Tuo unfavorably to the emperor.[^61] From this perspective, Zhao Tuo's policy of cultural assimilation and adoption of Yue customs represented a betrayal of Chinese civilization rather than an enlightened approach to governance.

### The Sinicization Controversy

Modern scholars have also debated Zhao Tuo's role in the sinicization of southern regions. Following the Han conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC, the area became a region for Chinese settlement, a policy that eventually resulted in the complete sinicization of Guangdong and Guangxi and introduced Chinese culture to northern Vietnam.[^62] While Zhao Tuo's bidirectional assimilation policies were relatively progressive for his time, his kingdom nevertheless served as a vehicle for Chinese cultural expansion into Southeast Asia, fundamentally altering the ethnic and cultural landscape of the region.

Critics argue that regardless of Zhao Tuo's intentions, his establishment of Nanyue facilitated Chinese colonization and cultural domination of indigenous peoples, setting precedents for later, more oppressive forms of Chinese rule over Vietnam.

## Personal Life

Details about Zhao Tuo's personal life remain relatively scarce in historical records, though several important facts have been preserved. By the time of his death in 137 BC, Zhao Tuo had outlived his own sons, necessitating succession by his grandson Zhao Mo.[^63] This suggests he had at least one son who predeceased him, though the identities and number of his children are not fully documented in surviving sources.

According to Vietnamese historical accounts, Zhao Tuo had a son named Zhong Shi (Trọng Thủy in Vietnamese), who married Mỵ Châu, the daughter of King An Dương Vương of Âu Lạc.[^64] This marriage, whether historical fact or legend, played a key role in the narrative of Zhao Tuo's conquest of Âu Lạc. The story portrays a complex family dynamic where Zhao Tuo used his son's marriage for strategic purposes, raising questions about the relationship between political ambition and family bonds in his life.

Traditional Vietnamese sources indicate that Zhao Tuo "took a Vietnamese wife according to Viet's customs" and integrated himself into local culture by self-proclaiming as "Man Di the great elder," suggesting he adopted elements of indigenous identity rather than maintaining strict Chinese cultural separation.[^65] This personal choice, if historical, reflected his broader political policy of cultural integration and demonstrated a willingness to cross ethnic and cultural boundaries unusual for a Chinese general of his era.

The sources do not provide specific information about Zhao Tuo's wives beyond these general references. However, the pattern of intermarriage between Han Chinese and Yue peoples became increasingly common in Nanyue throughout its existence, occurring even within the Zhao royal family.[^66] Many marriages between the Zhao royal family (who were Han Chinese) and the Lü family (Yue) were recorded, establishing a precedent that Zhao Tuo himself appears to have followed.[^67]

Zhao Tuo's personality, based on his political actions, appears to have been characterized by pragmatism, adaptability, and political cunning. His ability to navigate complex diplomatic relationships with the powerful Han dynasty, maintain independence while nominally acknowledging suzerainty, and balance the interests of diverse ethnic groups suggests sophisticated political intelligence. His longevity—living to approximately 103 years of age—was extraordinary for ancient times and enabled his exceptionally long reign of over 70 years.[^68]

His diplomatic correspondence with the Han court reveals a man capable of both deference and defiance depending on circumstances. When protesting Empress Lü's trade restrictions, he demonstrated willingness to challenge even the powerful Han Empire when his kingdom's interests were threatened.[^69] Yet he also knew when to compromise, accepting vassal status when it served Nanyue's strategic interests.

## Legacy

### Enduring Impact on Regional Development

Zhao Tuo's legacy fundamentally shaped the historical development of southern China and northern Vietnam. His kingdom served as a crucial transitional entity between the Qin dynasty's initial conquest of the south and the region's eventual integration into the Han Empire. The administrative systems, trade networks, and patterns of Han-Yue cultural interaction he established continued to influence the region long after Nanyue's fall to the Han in 111 BC.[^70]

The kingdom's leaders, including Zhao Tuo, were responsible for bringing Chinese-style bureaucracy and handicraft techniques to inhabitants of southern regions, as well as knowledge of the Chinese language and writing system.[^71] Nanyue rulers promoted a policy of "Harmonizing and Gathering the Hundred Yue tribes" and encouraged ethnic Han to immigrate from the Yellow River region to the south, fundamentally altering the demographic composition of southern China.[^72]

Zhao Tuo's establishment of Panyu (modern Guangzhou) as a major political and commercial center had lasting consequences. The city became an important node on the Maritime Silk Road during Nanyue's existence and continued this role for centuries afterward.[^73] The maritime trade networks and international connections fostered during Zhao Tuo's reign laid foundations for Guangzhou's later prominence as one of China's most important southern ports.

### The Name "Vietnam"

One of the most significant aspects of Zhao Tuo's legacy is linguistic. The name "Vietnam" (Việt Nam) is derived from and reversed from "Nam Việt," the Vietnamese pronunciation of "Nanyue" (Southern Yue).[^74] This etymological connection means that the modern nation of Vietnam carries in its very name a reference to Zhao Tuo's kingdom, regardless of whether contemporary Vietnamese historians view him as a founding father or foreign invader.

### Divergent Historical Memories

Zhao Tuo's legacy has been remembered very differently across cultures and time periods, creating multiple, often contradictory historical narratives.

**In Traditional Vietnamese Historiography:**
For centuries, Zhao Tuo was a folk hero among the Vietnamese people, remembered for standing up to the Han Empire.[^75] The oldest text compiled by a Vietnamese court, the 13th-century Đại Việt sử ký, considered Nanyue to be the official starting point of Vietnamese history, with Zhao Tuo establishing the foundation of Đại Việt.[^76] In the thirteenth century, the historian Lê Văn Hưu wrote a history of Vietnam using the Triệu dynasty as its starting point, with Zhao Tuo receiving glowing praise as Vietnam's first emperor.[^77]

Vietnamese literati honored Zhao Tuo for his moral virtue—a quality that enabled him to establish a kingdom and declare himself emperor—feeling that he had set a model for governance they wished to follow.[^78] Despite coming from the North, Zhao Tuo assimilated into Yue culture and created a new identity as the King of Nanyue, married a Yue woman, incorporated locals into his army, and fought off Han invasions to protect his kingdom.[^79]

**In Modern Vietnamese Historiography:**
The modern Vietnamese government's portrayal stands in stark contrast to this traditional veneration. Contemporary official Vietnamese historiography depicts Zhao Tuo negatively as a foreign invader, and Nanyue has been removed from the national historical narrative.[^80] This shift reflects the influence of modern nationalism and the desire to construct a narrative of continuous Vietnamese resistance against Chinese domination throughout history.

**In Chinese Historiography:**
Chinese historical assessment has also been complex and varied. Early Chinese historians recorded Zhao Tuo's achievements but also viewed Nanyue with some ambivalence as a separatist regime.[^81] The scholar Huang Zuo produced the first detailed published history of Nanyue in the fifteenth century, while Qu Dajun's 1696 denunciation condemned Zhao Tuo for cultural mixing.[^82] A more positive view of Nanyue multiculturalism was presented by Liang Tingnan in "Biographies of the Five Lords of Nanyue" in 1833, demonstrating ongoing Chinese scholarly debates about Zhao Tuo's legacy.[^83]

### Archaeological Legacy

The discovery in 1983 of the tomb of Zhao Mo (Zhao Tuo's grandson and the second king of Nanyue) has provided tangible evidence of Nanyue's cultural sophistication and international connections. The tomb, located 20 meters under Elephant Hill in Guangzhou, contained a complete trove of artifacts now displayed at the Museum of the Mausoleum of the Nanyue King, which opened in 1988.[^84] These artifacts, including items with Persian and West Asian influences, demonstrate the cosmopolitan nature of Zhao Tuo's kingdom and its far-reaching trade connections.

While Zhao Tuo's own tomb has never been discovered, the preservation and study of his grandson's burial site has renewed scholarly interest in the Nanyue period and provided physical evidence to supplement textual historical records.[^85]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Zhao Tuo positively emphasize several aspects of his rule that deserve recognition and praise.

**Progressive Cultural Policies:**
Zhao Tuo's bidirectional assimilation policy represented an enlightened approach to governance unusual for ancient times. Unlike the harsh cultural supremacy imposed by Qin Shi Huang, Zhao Tuo respected Yue customs, rallied local rulers, and encouraged cultural exchange between Han Chinese and indigenous peoples.[^86] His policy of encouraging Chinese immigrants to adopt Yue customs and promoting intermarriage created a multicultural society that integrated diverse populations rather than imposing cultural domination.[^87]

The gradual inclusion of Yue people in government positions, culminating in Lü Jia (a Yue citizen) becoming prime minister with over 70 kinsmen serving as officials, demonstrated a relatively meritocratic approach that provided opportunities for indigenous people to participate in governance.[^88] This stands in contrast to more oppressive colonial regimes that excluded indigenous populations from political power.

**Defender Against Han Expansion:**
Some historians do not see Zhao Tuo as a foreign conqueror but rather as the defender of Vietnam against the Han Chinese.[^89] From this perspective, his establishment of Nanyue as an independent kingdom created a buffer state that protected Southeast Asian kingdoms from direct Han conquest for nearly a century. His successful resistance to Empress Lü's military campaign in 181 BC demonstrated that determination and strategic geography could check even the mighty Han Empire.[^90]

For centuries, Zhao Tuo was celebrated as a folk hero among the Vietnamese people for standing up to the Han Empire, suggesting that historical communities close to the events viewed him as a protector rather than an oppressor.[^91] His willingness to adopt local customs and marry locally indicated genuine cultural integration rather than mere political opportunism.

**State-Building Achievement:**
Zhao Tuo's creation of a stable kingdom that lasted 93 years and handed down five kings represents a significant achievement in state-building.[^92] His administrative innovations, including decentralized governance that left indigenous chiefs in control while maintaining overall unity, balanced central authority with local autonomy in ways that maintained stability across diverse territories.[^93]

His transformation of Panyu into a major commercial center and his kingdom's role in developing the Maritime Silk Road contributed to regional economic development and international trade connections that benefited populations throughout Southeast Asia.[^94]

**Model for Vietnamese Governance:**
Traditional Vietnamese literati honored Zhao Tuo for his moral virtue and viewed him as setting a model for governance.[^95] The 13th-century Đại Việt sử ký's designation of Nanyue as the official starting point of Vietnamese history reflected a judgment by Vietnam's own scholars that Zhao Tuo established the foundation of their state.[^96] This indigenous historical assessment, maintained for centuries before modern nationalism reshaped Vietnamese historiography, carries significant weight in evaluating Zhao Tuo's legacy.

### Negative Views

Critics of Zhao Tuo emphasize different aspects of his rule that warrant condemnation or at minimum critical scrutiny.

**Foreign Invader and Conqueror:**
Modern Vietnamese historians generally regard Zhao Tuo as a foreign invader who conquered independent Vietnamese kingdoms, particularly the Âu Lạc kingdom ruled by An Dương Vương.[^97] From this perspective, his Chinese ethnic identity, service in the Qin military, and conquest of indigenous states make him fundamentally an agent of foreign imperialism rather than a Vietnamese founding father.

The 18th-century scholar Ngô Thì Sĩ's reevaluation, which argued that Zhao Tuo was a foreign invader based in Panyu who ruled the Red River Delta indirectly, initiated a critical tradition that views Nanyue as a foreign dynasty comparable to later Chinese occupations.[^98] The modern Vietnamese government's adoption of this negative portrayal reflects a scholarly consensus that Zhao Tuo's conquests represented Chinese expansion rather than Vietnamese state-building.[^99]

**Agent of Sinicization:**
Even if Zhao Tuo's cultural policies were relatively progressive for his time, his kingdom nevertheless served as a vehicle for Chinese cultural expansion and eventual sinicization of southern regions. Following Nanyue's conquest by the Han in 111 BC, the area became a region for extensive Chinese settlement, resulting in the complete sinicization of Guangdong and Guangxi and introducing lasting Chinese cultural influence to northern Vietnam.[^100]

Critics argue that Zhao Tuo's establishment of Chinese-style bureaucracy, promotion of Han immigration, and introduction of Chinese language and writing systems—regardless of his bidirectional assimilation policies—fundamentally altered the ethnic and cultural landscape in ways that facilitated later Chinese domination.[^101] From this perspective, his relatively benign personal rule paved the way for more oppressive Chinese regimes.

**Political Opportunism:**
Zhao Tuo's shifting relationships with the Han dynasty—alternately accepting vassal status and proclaiming independent emperor status depending on circumstances—can be viewed as unprincipled opportunism rather than skilled diplomacy.[^102] His willingness to abandon nominal Han allegiance when trade was restricted, then resume vassal status when relations normalized, suggests priorities of self-interest rather than consistent principles.

The legendary account of using his son's marriage to An Dương Vương's daughter for strategic purposes, culminating in betrayal and conquest, portrays Zhao Tuo as a manipulative figure willing to employ deception and family ties to achieve territorial ambitions.[^103]

**Illegitimate Separatist:**
Chinese historians have generally denounced Nanyue as separatists from the Han dynasty, viewing Zhao Tuo's establishment of an independent kingdom as illegitimate rebellion rather than justified state-building.[^104] The poet Qu Dajun's 1696 denunciation, which compared Zhao Tuo unfavorably to Qin Shi Huang regarding cultural purity, exemplifies Chinese criticism of his willingness to adopt "barbarian" customs.[^105]

From this perspective, Zhao Tuo betrayed his Chinese heritage and duty to the central dynasty by establishing an independent southern kingdom and adopting local customs, representing cultural degradation rather than progressive multiculturalism.

**Modern Nationalist Critique:**
Scholar John D. Phan has noted that modern nationalist narratives—both Vietnamese narratives of continuous resistance and Chinese narratives of territorial continuity—have distorted historical understanding of complex figures like Zhao Tuo.[^106] The intense contemporary debates about Zhao Tuo's legacy often reflect present political concerns about China-Vietnam relations rather than careful historical analysis of ancient events.

Critics of both positive and negative nationalist interpretations argue that Zhao Tuo was a product of his specific historical moment—the collapse of the Qin and the chaotic transition to the Han—whose actions cannot be fairly judged by modern standards of national identity, which did not exist in his time.
