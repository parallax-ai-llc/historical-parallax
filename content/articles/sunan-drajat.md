## Summary

Sunan Drajat (1470-1522), born Raden Qasim or Raden Syarifuddin, was one of the Wali Songo (Nine Saints) who played a pivotal role in establishing Islam as the dominant religion among the Javanese people during the 15th and 16th centuries[^1]. Distinguished from his fellow saints by his profound emphasis on social welfare and humanitarian work, Sunan Drajat pioneered a unique approach to Islamic propagation that prioritized alleviating poverty and suffering before religious instruction[^2]. His legacy endures through the Pepali Pitu (Seven Principles) and Catur Piwulang (Four Teachings), which continue to influence Islamic education and social practice in modern Indonesia[^3]. His tomb in Paciran, Lamongan, remains one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in East Java, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors annually[^4].

## Early Life and Background

Sunan Drajat was born in 1470 CE in Ampeldenta, Surabaya, into one of the most influential Islamic families in Java[^5]. His father was Sunan Ampel, affectionately known as the "Father of the Walis" and credited with guiding future Wali Songo members, while his mother was Nyi Ageng Manila, also known as Dewi Condrowati[^6]. As the youngest son of Sunan Ampel, Raden Qasim grew up alongside his brothers Sunan Bonang and Sunan Kudus, all of whom would become members of the legendary Wali Songo[^7].

The family lineage was extraordinary, representing the 23rd generation of descendants from Prophet Muhammad SAW, which gave young Raden Qasim considerable religious authority and prestige[^8]. His ancestry also included connections to Majapahit nobility in Tuban and Chinese heritage through a captain named Gan Eng Cu, reflecting the cosmopolitan nature of Java's coastal trading cities during this period[^9].

Sunan Drajat spent his formative years learning Islam from his father at Ampel Denta in Surabaya, receiving rigorous training in Islamic theology, jurisprudence, and spirituality[^10]. According to some historical accounts, Sunan Ampel sent him to Aceh and potentially to Mecca to deepen his Islamic studies, exposing him to the broader Islamic world beyond the archipelago[^11]. This education was complemented by instruction from Sunan Gunung Jati, another prominent member of the Wali Songo, who further shaped his understanding of Islamic teachings and missionary methods[^12].

The period of Sunan Drajat's youth coincided with the twilight years of the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit Empire, which was experiencing severe political fragmentation, economic crisis, and social upheaval[^13]. This tumultuous environment would profoundly influence his later approach to Islamic propagation, as he witnessed firsthand the suffering of ordinary people caught in the chaos of regime change and economic collapse. Unlike many religious scholars who focused primarily on theological instruction, the young Raden Qasim developed a deep sensitivity to the material needs of the poor and dispossessed, a concern that would define his entire mission[^14].

## Rise to Power

Sunan Drajat's emergence as a prominent religious figure began after he completed his Islamic education and received authorization from his father to conduct independent missionary work[^15]. His early preaching activities took him to various locations along Java's northern coast, where he initially worked in Banjaranyar, Paciran, before eventually settling in Desa Jelak (later known as Desa Drajat)[^16].

His marriage to Dewi Sufiyah, the daughter of Sunan Gunung Jati, marked a significant turning point in his career and social standing[^17]. This union connected him directly to the powerful Islamic sultanate in Cirebon and strengthened the network among the Wali Songo. According to the Babad Tjerbon, Dewi Sufiyah was Sunan Drajat's first wife, and their marriage occurred while he was assisting Sunan Gunung Jati in spreading Islam in the Cirebon area[^18]. Following his marriage, he undertook a three-month period of intense spiritual retreat and asceticism, after which he earned the honorific title "Sunan Drajat"[^19].

Around 1500 CE, Sunan Drajat established himself permanently in Paciran, where he built a religious community focused on education and social welfare[^20]. Within approximately two years, he had attracted a substantial following of students and converts through his innovative approach to Islamic propagation[^21]. Unlike conventional religious teachers who began with theological instruction, Sunan Drajat pioneered a revolutionary method: he would first inquire whether people had eaten, and if they had not, he would ensure they were fed before offering any religious teaching[^22].

The construction of his mosque in 1502 CE represented the formalization of his authority and the establishment of his territory as a recognized center of Islamic learning[^23]. The official opening ceremony was attended by other members of the Wali Songo, signifying his acceptance as an equal among these legendary figures and marking his arrival as one of Java's most important Islamic leaders[^24]. This mosque, built in the village of Jelag in Paciran, became the institutional foundation for his educational and social welfare activities[^25].

His rise coincided with the final collapse of the Majapahit Empire and the emergence of Islamic sultanates across Java[^26]. As traditional Hindu-Buddhist power structures crumbled, Sunan Drajat positioned himself as a spokesman for the oppressed and marginalized, defending the poor against exploitation and offering a vision of Islamic society based on social justice and mutual care[^27]. This advocacy for the dispossessed earned him enormous popularity among the common people, particularly fishermen, farmers, and traders who formed the backbone of coastal communities[^28].

---

## Major Achievements

Sunan Drajat's most significant achievement was the development and implementation of a comprehensive social welfare system integrated with Islamic education, creating a model that would influence Indonesian Islamic practice for centuries[^29]. His approach, known as da'wah bil-hikam (preaching with wisdom), emphasized gentle persuasion, cultural sensitivity, and practical assistance over theological confrontation[^30].

The establishment of his pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Desa Drajat represented a revolutionary educational institution that combined religious instruction with vocational training and economic development[^31]. Unlike traditional Islamic schools that focused exclusively on Quranic memorization and theological study, Sunan Drajat's institution taught practical skills including agriculture, fishing, trade, and maritime activities[^32]. This holistic approach to education reflected his understanding that religious knowledge without economic self-sufficiency would leave communities vulnerable to exploitation and poverty[^33].

His cultural innovations in Islamic propagation proved extraordinarily effective in converting Java's predominantly Hindu-Buddhist population[^34]. Following the example of his brother Sunan Bonang, Sunan Drajat composed gamelan songs and middle songs of macapat pangkur, using traditional Javanese musical forms to convey Islamic teachings[^35]. One famous example was the tune Gending 'Pangkur', which became popular throughout the region[^36]. A set of gamelan called Singo Mengkok, believed to be his legacy, is still preserved in the Sunan Drajat Museum[^37]. This cultural syncretism allowed Islam to spread without destroying existing artistic traditions, facilitating peaceful conversion rather than violent confrontation[^38].

The formulation of the Pepali Pitu (Seven Principles) stands as one of Sunan Drajat's most enduring intellectual contributions[^39]. These seven foundational teachings provided a comprehensive ethical framework for Islamic life in the Javanese context: (1) Mangun resep tyasing sasama (making people happy and bringing joy to fellow human beings), (2) Jroing suka kudu eling lan waspada (remaining mindful of God and vigilant even in moments of happiness), (3) Laksitaning subrata tan nyipta marang pringga bayaning lampah (pursuing noble ideals without being deterred by obstacles), (4) Meper hardaning pancadriya (suppressing worldly desires and controlling one's passions), (5) Heneng-hening-henung (achieving tranquility through silence, leading to spiritual freedom), (6) Mulya guna panca waktu (achieving nobility through performing the five daily prayers), and (7) practical charity emphasizing giving aid to those in need[^40][^41].

Complementing the Pepali Pitu was the Catur Piwulang (Four Teachings), which emphasized practical social welfare: give a walking stick to the blind, give food to the hungry, give clothing to those without clothes, and give shelter to those caught in the rain[^42]. These teachings, inscribed on a wooden board at his tomb, encapsulate his philosophy that humans with intellect and wisdom should generously share knowledge and resources to educate people and eradicate poverty[^43].

Sunan Drajat's missionary work contributed significantly to the Islamization of Java's northern coast during the critical period of the 15th and 16th centuries[^44]. Working in concert with other members of the Wali Songo, he helped establish Islam as the dominant religion among the Javanese, Indonesia's largest ethnic group, fundamentally transforming the religious and cultural landscape of the archipelago[^45]. His specific focus on coastal communities, particularly in the Lamongan and Gresik regions, created strongholds of Islamic practice that would endure through subsequent centuries[^46].

## Controversies and Criticisms

While Sunan Drajat himself remains largely uncontroversial in Indonesian Islamic tradition, the broader Wali Songo narrative to which he belongs has faced significant scholarly scrutiny and debate[^47]. The role of the Wali Songo is not free from controversy, with critics arguing that narratives about them are often embellished with myths and legends, making it difficult to distinguish actual historical facts from hagiographical fiction[^48]. The lives of these saints have become shrouded in legends that often aggrandize their accomplishments due to the desire to find inspirational models and stories[^49].

A fundamental controversy concerns the very existence of a cohesive "group of nine" saints[^50]. The term "Wali Sanga" was created retroactively by historians, and there was no official organization with formal membership[^51]. Differences in chronology suggest that there might never have been a time when nine of them were alive contemporaneously, raising questions about whether the Wali Songo should be understood as a historical collaboration or a later theological construction[^52].

The scarcity of contemporary written sources from the 14th and 15th centuries when the early generation of preachers played their most significant role has led some scholars to question the historical reliability of Wali Songo narratives[^53]. Because of these limitations in primary source material, certain scholars have characterized Walisongo as partially mythological, arguing that their stories serve religious and cultural functions rather than representing verifiable historical accounts[^54].

Debates over the genealogy and ethnic origins of the Wali Songo have generated considerable controversy[^55]. Tracing lineages earlier than Malik Ibrahim has proven problematic, with some scholars believing that the Wali Songo genealogies claiming Arab descent may actually indicate Chinese heritage, contradicting traditional narratives about their ancestry from Prophet Muhammad[^56]. This debate touches on sensitive issues of religious authority and authenticity in Indonesian Islam.

The syncretic nature of Javanese Islam, to which Sunan Drajat contributed through his use of gamelan music and adaptation to local customs, has generated ongoing theological tensions[^57]. Some orthodox Islamic movements in modern Indonesia criticize the tradition of pilgrimage to Wali Songo tombs as bid'ah (innovation) inconsistent with proper Islamic practice[^58]. Despite such criticism from certain organizations denying the legitimacy of pilgrimage to Wali Songo locations, the practice continues to attract millions of devotees[^59].

The relationship between the Wali Songo and political power during the transition from Majapahit to Islamic sultanates remains contested[^60]. While traditional narratives emphasize peaceful conversion, some historians question whether the spread of Islam was entirely non-coercive, pointing to the military conquest of Majapahit by the Islamic Sultanate of Demak in 1527 as evidence of violent confrontation rather than purely peaceful transition[^61]. The extent to which Sunan Drajat and his fellow saints collaborated with or resisted political violence remains unclear.

## Personal Life

Sunan Drajat was known by numerous names throughout his life, including Raden Qasim (or Qosim), Raden Syarifuddin, Masaikh Munat, Maulana Hasyim, Pangeran Kadrajat, and Sunan Mayang Madu, reflecting both his noble birth and his spiritual accomplishments[^62]. This multiplicity of names was common among Javanese nobility and religious figures, with different names used in different contexts and stages of life.

His family life was polygamous, following Islamic legal traditions of his era[^63]. His first and most significant marriage was to Dewi Sufiyah, daughter of Sunan Gunung Jati, with whom he had three children: Pangeran Trenggana, Pangeran Sandi, and a daughter named Dewi Wuryan[^64]. He also married Nyai Kemuning and Nyai Retna Ayu Candra, though less is known about these unions[^65]. Some genealogical records also mention a son named Sayyid Musa (Sunan Pakuan) and another son named Shodiq, though the details of these children remain unclear in historical sources[^66].

Sunan Drajat's personality was characterized by profound compassion and practical wisdom rather than ascetic withdrawal from society[^67]. He was known as someone with a high social conscience who prioritized the welfare of communities he served, demonstrating genuine concern for the suffering of others[^68]. His teaching method reflected this character: he would not hesitate to provide help to people who suffer, the orphans, the sick, the poor and the destitute before offering any religious instruction[^69].

His approach to spirituality emphasized social engagement over isolation, distinguishing him from more ascetically-oriented Islamic traditions[^70]. While he certainly engaged in spiritual practices—including the three-month retreat following his marriage—his primary focus remained on community service and education rather than mystical contemplation removed from worldly concerns[^71]. This practical orientation made him particularly effective in appealing to ordinary people struggling with material hardship.

Sunan Drajat settled permanently in the coastal hamlet of Drajat after his marriage to Dewi Sufiyah, and this village became synonymous with his name and mission[^72]. He lived among the fishing and farming communities he served, sharing their daily struggles and understanding their needs through direct experience[^73]. This choice to remain embedded in coastal society rather than retreating to a more isolated religious sanctuary reflected his fundamental conviction that Islamic practice must address material as well as spiritual needs.

## Legacy

Sunan Drajat's death in 1522 CE in Paciran, Lamongan, marked the end of his earthly life but the beginning of his enduring influence on Indonesian Islam[^74]. His tomb, located in Drajat Village in Paciran District, became one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Java, attracting domestic tourists and visitors from across Asia who seek his blessings and spiritual intercession[^75][^76].

The tomb complex itself embodies his teachings and legacy[^77]. Pilgrims must pass through seven terraced levels before reaching the burial site, with each level symbolically representing one of the seven principles of Pepali Pitu[^78]. The complex features a blend of wooden and brick construction, with earlier terraces primarily made of wood and later ones using brick in a style reminiscent of miniature temples, reflecting the architectural syncretism characteristic of Javanese Islam[^79]. The Sunan Drajat Museum within the complex houses historical artifacts including traditional gamelan instruments such as the bonang, angklung, ketuk, rebab, gender, and saron, preserving the cultural innovations he used for Islamic propagation[^80].

The modern Pondok Pesantren Sunan Drajat (PPSD) represents perhaps the most significant institutional continuation of his legacy[^81]. Rebuilt and expanded in 1977 to Banjaranyar Village, the pesantren came under the leadership of KH Abdul Ghofur, the 15th descendant of Sunan Drajat, who inherited the 140-hectare complex in 1980[^82]. The contemporary institution has grown to include madrasah tsanawiyah, madrasah mu'allimin mu'allimat, junior high school, vocational high school, madrasah aliyah, and Sunan Drajat University (UNSUD), serving thousands of students[^83].

Most remarkably, PPSD has implemented Sunan Drajat's economic philosophy with extraordinary success[^84]. The pesantren operates a modern shipbuilding factory, produces non-chemical organic fertilizers from limestone, manufactures health drinks made from mengkudu, and markets salt products under the Samudra Sunan Derajat brand[^85]. With assets including almost 1,200 trucks generating annual profits of approximately 216 billion Indonesian Rupiah, the institution demonstrates that Islamic education and economic development can be integrated as Sunan Drajat envisioned[^86]. The Sunan Drajat Sharia Cooperative has transformed into an economic giant with a turnover of hundreds of billions, and the Indonesian government designated KSBP Sunan Drajat as a role model for the Merah Putih Cooperative, a national program to strengthen the people's economy[^87].

Sunan Drajat's influence extends beyond institutional legacy to shape contemporary Indonesian Islamic thought and practice[^88]. His emphasis on social welfare before religious instruction continues to inform approaches to Islamic education and community development throughout the archipelago[^89]. His model of cultural adaptation—using gamelan music, wayang puppetry, and other Javanese artistic forms to convey Islamic teachings—established a pattern of peaceful religious transformation that distinguishes Indonesian Islam from more confrontational models elsewhere[^90].

The legacy left by Sunan Drajat remains obvious in modern Javanese society through various mosques and Islamic boarding schools that continue to function today, carrying forward his educational philosophy and social vision[^91]. His teachings on practical charity, social justice, and compassionate leadership continue to resonate in a nation still grappling with poverty, inequality, and religious pluralism[^92]. The seven wise sayings displayed at his tomb complex continue to inspire visitors: always make others happy; remain mindful and alert even in joyful times; pursue noble ideals without worrying about obstacles; control one's desires and passions; find serenity in stillness; achieve happiness through the five daily prayers; and give aid to those in need[^93][^94].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern Indonesian scholars overwhelmingly celebrate Sunan Drajat as a pioneering figure in Islamic social welfare and education[^95]. Academic research published in journals such as Progresiva: Jurnal Pemikiran dan Pendidikan Islam emphasizes his role in the development of Islamic Education across various fields including da'wah, social services, arts and culture, and the purification of Islamic creed during the critical 15th century period[^96]. Researchers note that his attitude in preaching and teaching morality demonstrated exceptional wisdom and genuine concern for others, establishing him as a model for contemporary Islamic educators[^97].

Scholarly analysis of his social concept, particularly the Catur Piwulang (Four Teachings), has found applications in modern multicultural education contexts[^98]. Academic publications in ResearchGate and other platforms examine how Sunan Drajat's emphasis on generously sharing knowledge to educate people and eradicate poverty remains highly relevant to contemporary Indonesia's educational challenges[^99]. His integration of vocational training with religious instruction is praised as visionary, anticipating modern holistic education models by five centuries[^100].

The architectural and artistic legacy preserved at Sunan Drajat's tomb has attracted scholarly attention for its environmental conservation values and cultural synthesis[^101]. Recent research examines how decorative elements at the tomb reflect the acculturation of Islam to Javanese culture while incorporating elements from Chinese and Champa cultures, demonstrating the cosmopolitan nature of early Javanese Islam[^102]. Scholars identify him as one of the most successful spreaders of Islam on Java's northern coast specifically because he utilized local culture as a medium of da'wah rather than attempting to suppress it[^103].

Religious tourism scholars view the pilgrimage tradition to Sunan Drajat's tomb as culturally and spiritually significant, with studies published in the Journal of Environmental Management and Tourism and other academic venues exploring how ziyarat (pilgrimage) to Wali Songo sites contributes to religious identity formation and community cohesion[^104]. Research indicates high visitor satisfaction and strong intentions to revisit, suggesting the enduring power of his legacy to attract devotees[^105].

Contemporary Islamic boarding school research highlights how institutions continuing Sunan Drajat's educational philosophy successfully improve students' life skills through integrated religious and vocational training[^106]. Studies published in the International Journal of Business and Economic Affairs examine the remarkable business success of Pesantren Sunan Drajat as a "role model" for cooperative economic development, demonstrating the practical viability of his economic teachings[^107].

### Negative Views

While Sunan Drajat himself rarely faces direct criticism, scholars have raised important questions about the historical reliability of Wali Songo narratives generally[^108]. The limited availability of contemporary written sources from the 14th-15th centuries has led some historians to express skepticism about the accuracy of traditional accounts, with certain scholars characterizing the Wali Songo as partially mythological constructs serving religious and cultural functions rather than representing entirely verifiable historical figures[^109].

Critical historians question whether the Wali Songo ever functioned as a cohesive "group of nine" or whether this categorization represents a retrospective theological construction[^110]. Since the term "Wali Sanga" was created by later historians rather than being a self-designation, and since chronological analysis suggests the nine may never have all been alive simultaneously, some scholars argue that traditional narratives impose artificial coherence on what was actually a more diverse and fragmented Islamic missionary movement[^111].

The genealogical claims connecting Sunan Drajat and other Wali Songo to Prophet Muhammad through the 23rd generation face scholarly scrutiny[^112]. Some researchers suggest that certain lineages may actually indicate Chinese rather than Arab descent, calling into question the religious authority derived from claimed prophetic ancestry[^113]. This genealogical controversy touches on sensitive issues about the sources of religious legitimacy in Indonesian Islam.

Orthodox Islamic movements in modern Indonesia have criticized aspects of the Wali Songo legacy, particularly the pilgrimage practices centered on their tombs[^114]. These critics argue that tomb visitation and seeking intercession from deceased saints constitute bid'ah (forbidden innovation) incompatible with proper Islamic monotheism, despite the popularity of these practices among the majority of Indonesian Muslims[^115]. Organizations denying the legitimacy of Wali Songo pilgrimage traditions represent an ongoing theological tension within Indonesian Islam.

The syncretic elements of Javanese Islam that Sunan Drajat helped establish—including the use of gamelan music, wayang puppetry, and accommodation to local customs—face criticism from reformist movements seeking to purify Indonesian Islamic practice from what they view as Hindu-Buddhist or animist contamination[^116]. The longstanding dispute between orthodox and syncretic approaches to Islam, exemplified historically by Sunan Bonang's conflict with Siti Jenar, continues to shape debates about proper Islamic practice in modern Indonesia, with Sunan Drajat's cultural adaptations sometimes viewed suspiciously by purist movements[^117].

Some historians raise questions about the extent to which Islamization in Java was truly peaceful and non-coercive[^118]. While Sunan Drajat's methods emphasized gentle persuasion and social welfare, the broader context included the military conquest of Majapahit by Islamic forces in 1527, suggesting that the transition from Hindu-Buddhist to Islamic dominance involved elements of violence and political coercion alongside peaceful conversion[^119]. The relationship between the Wali Songo's missionary work and political-military developments remains contested in historical scholarship.
