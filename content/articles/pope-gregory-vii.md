## Summary

Pope Gregory VII (Hildebrand) was Pope from 1073 to 1085 and one of the most powerful and reform-minded popes in history. He asserted papal supremacy over secular rulers in the Investiture Controversy, famously making Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV wait barefoot in the snow at Canossa. His Dictatus Papae outlined 27 propositions of papal authority. He was eventually forced into exile by Henry IV and died saying 'I have loved righteousness and hated iniquity.'
