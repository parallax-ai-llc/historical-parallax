## Summary

Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a German Lutheran pastor and theologian who actively resisted Nazism. His books The Cost of Discipleship and Letters and Papers from Prison are classics of 20th-century theology. He was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and was executed at the Flossenbürg concentration camp weeks before the end of World War II. His concept of 'religionless Christianity' influenced later theological developments.
