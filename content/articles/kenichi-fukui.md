## Summary

Kenichi Fukui was a Japanese chemist who shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Roald Hoffmann for their theories concerning the course of chemical reactions. He developed frontier molecular orbital theory, showing that chemical reactions are controlled by the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO). He was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
