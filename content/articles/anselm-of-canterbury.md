## Summary

Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) was an Italian Benedictine monk who became Archbishop of Canterbury and is recognized as the "Father of Scholasticism."[^1] He is renowned for developing the ontological argument for God's existence and the satisfaction theory of atonement.[^2] His tenure as archbishop was marked by fierce conflicts with English kings William II and Henry I over the investiture controversy, resulting in two periods of exile.[^3] Proclaimed a Doctor of the Church in 1720, Anselm profoundly influenced medieval philosophy and theology through his principle of "faith seeking understanding" (fides quaerens intellectum).[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Anselm was born between April 1033 and April 1034 in Aosta, a strategically important town in Upper Burgundy (modern-day northern Italy) situated at the juncture of the Great and Little St. Bernard routes.[^5] His father Gundulf was a Lombard who had become a citizen of Aosta, while his mother Ermenberga came from an old Burgundian family.[^6] Like many other saints, Anselm learned his first lessons of piety from his mother, who provided his initial religious education.[^7]

In his adolescence, Anselm decided that monastic life was the highest calling and sought to become a monk, but the abbot of the local monastery refused his request.[^8] Following his mother's death, Anselm's relationship with his father deteriorated significantly. Gundulf repented of his earlier lifestyle but professed his newfound faith with a severity that the young Anselm found unbearable.[^9] When Gundulph entered a monastery himself, the 23-year-old Anselm left home with a single attendant, crossed the Alps, and wandered through Burgundy and France for three years.[^10]

His countryman Lanfranc of Pavia was then serving as prior of the Benedictine abbey of Bec in Normandy. Attracted by Lanfranc's formidable reputation as a scholar and teacher, Anselm reached Normandy in 1059.[^11] Lanfranc recognized the young man's potential and sent him to Maurilius, the archbishop of Rouen, who convinced Anselm to enter Bec as a novice at the age of 27 in 1060.[^12] Anselm quickly became close to and a devoted student of Lanfranc, sharing in the work of teaching at the abbey.[^13] This relationship proved pivotal to Anselm's future career, as Lanfranc would later become Archbishop of Canterbury, a position Anselm would eventually inherit.

---

## Rise to Power

Because of Anselm's reputation for great intellectual ability and sincere piety, he was elected prior of the monastery in 1063 after Lanfranc became abbot of Caen.[^14] Despite being younger than many of the monks, his wisdom, personality, heartfelt kindness, and holiness won over those who initially disapproved of his early appointment as prior.[^15] As prior, Anselm developed a distinctive teaching style that took the form of Socratic questioning, inviting students to debate with him.[^16] This strategy was considered quite difficult for students, and many remarked how Anselm planted intellectual seeds that the students then watered with their tears.[^17]

During his time at Bec, Anselm composed his most important philosophical and theological works. Between 1075 and 1076, he wrote the *Monologion*, which presents three distinct proofs for the existence of God, arguing that goodness, existence, and degrees of reality must ultimately stem from a singular, supremely good source, defined as God.[^18] This was followed in 1077-1078 by the *Proslogion*, in which he introduced his famous ontological argument for the existence of God.[^19] Anselm wanted to find "a single argument that needed nothing but itself alone for proof, that would by itself be enough to show that God really exists."[^20]

Between 1080 and 1086, Anselm composed four philosophical dialogues: *De Grammatico*, *De Veritate* (On Truth), *De Libertate Arbitrii* (On Freedom of Choice), and *De Casu Diaboli* (On the Fall of the Devil).[^21] In *De Veritate*, he argues that truth consists in correctness or "rectitude" across statements, opinions, the will, actions, the senses, and even the essences of things.[^22] In *De Libertate Arbitrii*, Anselm defines freedom of choice as "the power to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake."[^23]

In 1078, upon the death of Herluin, the founder and first abbot of Bec, Anselm was elected abbot.[^24] His reputation as a scholar, administrator, and spiritual leader continued to grow throughout his tenure at Bec. During a visit to England in 1093, King William II Rufus, who had kept the see of Canterbury vacant for four years after Lanfranc's death in order to appropriate its revenues, fell seriously ill and feared divine punishment.[^25] In March 1093, William named Anselm archbishop of Canterbury, though Anselm initially resisted the appointment, reportedly having the pastoral staff forced into his clenched hands.[^26]

## Major Achievements

### Philosophical Contributions

Anselm's most enduring philosophical achievement is his ontological argument for God's existence, presented in the *Proslogion*. He defines God as "that, the greater than which cannot be conceived," arguing that such a being must exist in reality and not merely in the mind.[^27] The argument proceeds by claiming that if God existed only as an idea in the mind, we could conceive of something greater—namely, a God who exists in reality—which would contradict the initial definition.[^28] Therefore, God must exist in reality. This argument has had numerous critics, defenders, and adaptors philosophically or theologically notable in their own right, among them St. Bonaventure, St. Thomas Aquinas, Descartes, Gassendi, Spinoza, Malebranche, Locke, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel.[^29]

Anselm is known as the father of Scholasticism, a philosophical school of thought that dominated the Middle Ages.[^30] He was traditionally accorded the title "Scholastic Doctor," since his approach to philosophical and theological matters both represents and contributed to early medieval Christian Scholasticism.[^31] His works are considered philosophical as well as theological since they endeavor to render Christian tenets of faith, traditionally taken as revealed truth, as a rational system.[^32] Unlike most of his contemporaries, Anselm deployed argumentation that was in most respects only indirectly dependent on Sacred Scripture, Christian doctrine, and tradition.[^33]

### Theological Innovations

Between 1094 and 1098, Anselm composed *Cur Deus Homo* (Why God Became Man), in which he proposes the satisfaction view of the atonement.[^34] According to this theory, based upon the feudal structure of society, finite humanity has committed a crime (sin) against infinite God.[^35] In feudal society, an offender was required to make recompense, or satisfaction, to the one offended according to that person's status. Since sin disrupts the universal order of justice established by God, it creates an infinite debt that finite humans cannot repay, as it constitutes an affront to God's infinite dignity.[^36] Only Jesus Christ, as both fully divine and fully human, can provide satisfaction of infinite value through his voluntary, sinless obedience and sacrificial death.[^37] With some relatively minor alterations, Anselm's doctrine of the Atonement eventually passed over into the theology of the Latin church, forming the basis of both Roman Catholic and orthodox Protestant ideas of the work of Christ.[^38]

In 1099, Anselm wrote *De Conceptu Virginali et de Originali Peccato* (On the Virgin Conception and Original Sin).[^39] Although Anselm himself did not teach that Mary was immaculately conceived, his analysis of original sin contains two theological insights that are crucial for the subsequent affirmation and articulation of this unique Marian privilege.[^40] Anselm provided Bl. John Duns Scotus (1265/6-1308) with several conceptual clarifications and insights essential for the Subtle Doctor's explanation and defense of the theological opinion favoring Mary's Immaculate Conception.[^41]

### Devotional Writings

The prayers and meditations of Anselm of Aosta were mostly written between 1070 and 1080, before he became Archbishop of Canterbury.[^42] These devotions created a tradition of intimate, intensely personal prayer that drastically altered the Christian attitude to private devotion.[^43] St. Anselm's prayers and meditations are to be read slowly, during times of peace, intended to stir up within the reader the feelings of love and fear of God.[^44] St. Anselm's meditations focus on the redemption of mankind, while his prayers praise God for His glory and thank the Holy Spirit for His blessing, but also ask for the strength to love and forgive enemies during times of weakness.[^45]

### Political Achievements

Anselm's political victory in the investiture controversy was substantial. The 1107 Concordat of London (also known as the Westminster Agreement) resolved the investiture controversy between Pope Paschal II and King Henry I of England.[^46] The king renounced investiture of bishops and abbots with the ring and crosier (staff), the symbols of their office, but retained the requirement that clergy pay homage to him for the landed properties they held from him—the temporalities.[^47] The Westminster Agreement was a model for the Concordat of Worms (1122), which resolved the broader European investiture controversy.[^48] Anselm emerged from the contest having won nearly all his political objectives, making the primate almost a co-ruler with the king.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Conflicts with Royal Authority

Anselm's tenure as archbishop of Canterbury was marked by nearly uninterrupted conflict over numerous issues with King William Rufus, who attempted not only to appropriate church lands, offices, and incomes, but even to have Anselm deposed.[^50] Anselm's vision was of a Catholic Church with its own internal authority, which clashed with William II's desire for royal control over both church and state.[^51] Key disputes included financial demands—William refused £500 from Anselm, encouraged by his courtiers to insist on £1000 as a kind of annates for Anselm's elevation to archbishop.[^52]

William refused to allow Anselm to go to Rome to receive the pallium from Pope Urban II, lest this be taken as an implied royal recognition of Urban.[^53] Anselm insisted that all lands belonging to Canterbury at Lanfranc's death be restored, including lands William had granted to his own men, showing the king had treated the archbishopric as a forfeited fief.[^54] Anselm also insisted he be allowed to continue in the obedience of Pope Urban II, whom he had already acknowledged in Normandy.[^55] Relations were so poor that Anselm eventually fled into exile in 1097 and sought the help of Pope Urban II.[^56] Pope Urban II refused William Rufus's demands to depose Anselm, and while Anselm remained in exile until 1100, William continued to claim the Archbishop's revenues.[^57]

After William II's death in 1100, conflicts arose between Archbishop Anselm and the new king Henry I when Henry asked Anselm to do homage for the lands he held belonging to the Crown and over the right of the king to elect bishops.[^58] This led to Anselm's second exile from 1105 to 1107.[^59] The Investiture Controversy was actually a three-way struggle between king, pope, and primate, with Anselm ending the dispute only when he gained concessions from Henry that made the primate almost a co-ruler with the king.[^60] From 1101 to 1103, Anselm wavered between parties while securing important privileges for Canterbury's primacy.[^61]

### Philosophical Criticisms

Gaunilo, a monk and contemporary of Anselm, wrote a "Reply on Behalf of the Fool," contending that Anselm's ontological argument gave no good reason to believe in God's existence.[^62] Gaunilo proposed the "greatest conceivable island" argument, suggesting that following Anselm's reasoning, the greatest conceivable island would also have to exist, which is obviously absurd.[^63] Thomas Aquinas objected to Anselm's argument, suggesting that people cannot know the nature of God and therefore cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed.[^64] He reasoned that the ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone who understands the essence of God completely, and that only God can completely know His essence.[^65]

David Hume argued that nothing can be proven to exist using only a priori reasoning.[^66] Hume also offered an empirical objection, criticizing the argument's lack of evidential reasoning and rejecting the idea that anything can exist necessarily.[^67] Immanuel Kant's famous critique was based on what he saw as the false premise that existence is a predicate, arguing that "existing" adds nothing (including perfection) to the essence of a being, and thus a "supremely perfect" being can be conceived not to exist.[^68] A common worry is that Anselm's argument illegitimately moves from the existence of an idea to the existence of a thing that corresponds to the idea—that Anselm simply defines things into existence, which cannot be done.[^69]

### Modern Scholarly Controversies

Many of Anselm's letters contain passionate expressions of attachment and affection, often addressed "to the beloved lover" (*dilecto dilectori*).[^70] These writings have sparked significant academic debate about Anselm's sexuality. Some academics such as McGuire and Boswell have characterized these writings as expressions of a homosexual inclination.[^71] John Boswell, Ph.D., historian from Yale University, authored "Christianity, Social Tolerance and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century" and has been influential in this interpretation.[^72] However, the general view, expressed by Olsen and Southern, sees the expressions as representing a "wholly spiritual" affection "nourished by an incorporeal ideal."[^73] The controversy continues to be debated among medieval scholars, with both sides citing the same historical evidence but interpreting it through different frameworks.[^74]

## Personal Life

Anselm was known for his "good example and his loving, kindly method of discipline, particularly with the younger monks."[^75] His wisdom, personality, heartfelt kindness, and holiness won over monks who initially disapproved of his early appointment as prior.[^76] His teaching style was characterized by Socratic questioning and inviting students to debate with him, though this strategy was considered quite difficult, and many remarked how Anselm planted the seed that the students then watered with their tears.[^77]

Anselm's most important relationship was with Lanfranc, who became his mentor when Anselm arrived at Bec. Anselm quickly became close to and a devoted student of the prior, Lanfranc, sharing in the work of teaching at Bec Abbey.[^78] This relationship was pivotal, as Lanfranc later became Archbishop of Canterbury, and Anselm would eventually succeed him.[^79] Another significant relationship was with Eadmer, then a young monk of Canterbury, who later became Anselm's biographer and primary historical source for his life.[^80]

Among Anselm's students, Boso appeared in dialogue form in Anselm's work *Cur Deus Homo*.[^81] Gilbert Crispin was described as Anselm's "former pupil" who became abbot of Westminster.[^82] Anselm maintained his monastic ideals throughout his life, including stewardship, prudence, and proper instruction, prayer and contemplation.[^83] As archbishop, Anselm advocated for reform and the interests of Canterbury, repeatedly pressing the English monarchy for support of the reform agenda.[^84]

Anselm's father treated him with great harshness after his mother's death, which led him to leave home at age 23.[^85] This difficult family relationship shaped his character and contributed to his decision to pursue monastic life. Despite these early struggles, or perhaps because of them, Anselm developed a reputation for compassion and pastoral care that distinguished his leadership style both as abbot and as archbishop.

## Legacy

### Influence on Scholasticism

Anselm is known as the father of Scholasticism, a philosophical school of thought that dominated the Middle Ages.[^86] He was traditionally accorded the title "Scholastic Doctor," since his approach to philosophical and theological matters both represents and contributed to early medieval Christian Scholasticism.[^87] His works were copied and disseminated in his lifetime, and exercised an influence on later Scholastics, among them Bonaventure, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham.[^88] His logical approach to theology laid the foundations for the scholastic movement, significantly impacting figures like Thomas Aquinas.[^89]

Anselm's combination of Christianity, neoplatonic metaphysics, and Aristotelean logic in the form of dialectical question-and-answer was an important influence in the development of scholasticism during the next several centuries.[^90] Anselm of Canterbury is the most enduringly influential philosopher-theologian of the Latin West between Augustine and the thirteenth century.[^91] He is often called "the most luminous and penetrating intellect between St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas."[^92]

### Ecclesiastical Recognition

Anselm's cult was formally sanctioned by Pope Alexander VI in 1494 or 1497, though his canonization was initially requested by Thomas Becket at the Council of Tours in 1163, and he may have been formally canonized before Becket's murder in 1170.[^93] The canonization was confirmed by Pope Alexander VI on October 4, 1494.[^94] Anselm was proclaimed a Doctor of the Church by Pope Clement XI in 1720, earning the titles "doctor magnificus" (Magnificent Doctor) or "doctor Marianus" (Marian Doctor).[^95]

### Continuing Philosophical Influence

Anselm is now famous as the originator of the ontological argument for the existence of God and of the satisfaction theory of atonement.[^96] His thoughts have guided much subsequent discussion on the procession of the Holy Spirit and the atonement.[^97] The ontological argument continues to be debated by modern scholars, with various philosophers both defending and criticizing it throughout history.[^98] Anselm has been called "the most luminous and penetrating intellect between St Augustine and St Thomas Aquinas" and continues to be studied for his profound contributions to medieval philosophy and theology.[^99]

### Burial and Commemoration

St. Anselm died on Holy Wednesday, April 21, 1109.[^100] Following Anselm's death in 1109 he was translated and buried in Canterbury Cathedral close to the resting place of Archbishop Lanfranc.[^101] His remains are believed to have been relocated to St. Anselm's Chapel during the rebuilding and reorganization of the cathedral in the 1170s, after which the chapel became known as St Anselm's Chapel.[^102] This twelfth century chapel was originally dedicated to St Peter and St Paul, and his relics were venerated there from around 1130 until the Reformation.[^103] Unfortunately, upon the closing of monasteries by the orders of King Henry VIII, Anselm's relics were lost.[^104] Nevertheless, the memory of St Anselm continues within the chapel dedicated to him on the right side of the nave at Canterbury Cathedral.[^105]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars have consistently praised Anselm's intellectual rigor and originality. With the exception of St. Augustine, and to a lesser extent Boethius, it is difficult to definitively ascribe the influence of other thinkers to the development of St. Anselm's thought.[^106] Anselm's views developed under the great influence of the teachings of Aurelius Augustine, following this famous patristic figure in believing that faith must precede knowledge and that it excludes all doubt, reflected in his motto "I believe so that I might understand."[^107] However, Augustine's thought was the pervading atmosphere in which Anselm moved, but he was never content merely to reproduce Augustine.[^108] Anselm's originality clearly furthered and expanded that tradition, and prepared the way for later Scholasticism.[^109]

Anselm's ardor, literary brilliance, and scrupulous theology have secured him admiration across centuries.[^110] Although the main intellectual influence upon him was Augustine, he is less platonistic than the latter, and the influence of Aristotle's *De interpretatione* and *Categories* is clearly discernible in his philosophical works.[^111] Even earlier than Thomas Aquinas, he undertook the attempt to rationally prove the existence of God.[^112]

Contemporary scholars recognize Anselm's political acumen as well as his intellectual achievements. During his rule, Anselm accomplished his goals by taking advantage of times when the kings faced political crises, acting shrewdly with 'holy guile' and skillful negotiation, always aware of public opinion's potent effect.[^113] The Concordat of London was very similar to the Concordat of Worms, and the development up to the first agreements on investiture in Saint-Denis and London in 1107 showed what a solution to the problem could look like 15 years before the Concordat of Worms.[^114]

### Negative Views

Critics have pointed to weaknesses in Anselm's philosophical arguments and questioned some aspects of his character and judgment. The ontological argument has been subjected to sustained philosophical criticism from Anselm's own time to the present day. Gaunilo's contemporary objection—that the same reasoning could prove the existence of a perfect island—has never been satisfactorily answered by defenders of the argument.[^115] Thomas Aquinas's objection that humans cannot sufficiently know God's essence to make Anselm's argument work remains influential in Thomistic circles.[^116]

Kant's devastating critique that existence is not a predicate effectively ended the argument's credibility for many modern philosophers, though some contemporary philosophers like Alvin Plantinga have attempted to rehabilitate modal versions of the argument.[^117] David Hume's empirical objection that nothing can be proven to exist using only a priori reasoning reflects a fundamental skepticism about Anselm's rationalist methodology that continues to resonate with empiricist philosophers.[^118]

Some critics have questioned whether Anselm's satisfaction theory of atonement, while influential, relies too heavily on feudal social structures and presents God as primarily concerned with honor rather than love.[^119] Modern theologians have sometimes found the theory problematic for suggesting that God requires violent satisfaction before extending forgiveness, which they argue contradicts the gospel message of unconditional divine love.

Regarding his political conflicts, some historians have suggested that Anselm could be stubborn and inflexible, prolonging conflicts that a more diplomatic archbishop might have resolved more quickly.[^120] His two exiles, while demonstrating principle, also left the English church without effective leadership for extended periods. The contemporary controversy over Anselm's passionate letters to other men, while not conclusive, has raised questions about how fully we understand his personal life and relationships.[^121]
