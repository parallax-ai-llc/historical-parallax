## Overview

In 1923, the Weimar Republic suffered one of the most extreme cases of hyperinflation in history. Triggered by the punitive reparations of the Treaty of Versailles and the French occupation of the Ruhr (Germany's industrial heartland), the government printed money to pay striking workers. The value of the Papiermark collapsed. Prices doubled every few days. At its peak, a loaf of bread cost 200 billion marks. People carried money in wheelbarrows, burned banknotes for heat (cheaper than wood), and children played with stacks of cash like lego blocks.

## Life in Zero Value

**The "Zero Stroke":**
People suffered from a nervous condition called "zero stroke" (urge to write endless zeros).
**Daily Wages:**
Workers were paid twice a day. They threw their pay packets out the window to waiting wives, who ran to the shops before prices rose again at lunchtime.
**Theft:**
Thieves would dump the money out of a stolen wheelbarrow and steal the wheelbarrow.

## Political Consequences

The savings of the middle class—pensions, bonds, bank accounts—were wiped out instantly.
The working class (wages indexed) and the rich (hard assets/foreign currency) survived better.
**The Middle Class Radicalized:**
Feeling betrayed by democracy and capitalism, the ruined middle class became the prime recruiting ground for the **Nazi Party**.
**Beer Hall Putsch (1923):** Hitler tried to seize power during the peak of the crisis.

## Recovery: The Rentenmark

Hjalmar Schacht stopped the printing presses.
He introduced a new currency, the **Rentenmark**, backed not by gold (Germany had none) but by a mortgage on all German land and industry.
Within days, inflation stopped. The "Miracle of the Rentenmark."
