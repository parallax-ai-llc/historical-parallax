## Summary

Shiing-Shen Chern was a Chinese-American mathematician who was one of the greatest geometers of the 20th century. He developed Chern classes and the Chern-Gauss-Bonnet theorem, fundamental tools in differential geometry and topology. His work bridged the gap between geometry and physics and influenced string theory and gauge theory.
