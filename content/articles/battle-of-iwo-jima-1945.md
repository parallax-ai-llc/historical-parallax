## Overview

The Battle of Iwo Jima (Feb 19 – March 26, 1945) was one of the most intensive battles of the Pacific War. The US needed the island (8 sq miles of volcanic rock) as an emergency landing strip for B-29 bombers attacking Japan. The Japanese commander, **General Tadamichi Kuribayashi**, completely changed Japanese defensive tactics. Instead of suicidal Banzai charges on the beach, he built a honeycomb of 11 miles of tunnels and bunkers deep underground. He ordered his men to "kill ten Americans before you die." The result was five weeks of horror where Marines had to burn out each cave individually. It remains the only battle where total US casualties exceeded Japanese casualties (though Japanese had more *dead*).

## The Defenses

**Kuribayashi's Strategy:**
- **No defense at water's edge:** Allowed Marines to land and pile up on the beaches.
- **Crossfire:** Hidden artillery and machine guns zeroed in on the crowded beaches.
- **Underground:** Hospitals, barracks, and command centers were 30-50 feet underground. Immune to naval bombardment.

## The Battle

### D-Day (Feb 19)
Marines landed in black volcanic ash (which sucked boots/vehicles like quicksand).
For an hour, silence. Then, hell unleashed. Artillery rained down.
Casualties: 2,400 on Day 1 alone.

### Mount Suribachi (Feb 23)
The highest point on the island.
**The Flag Raising:**
- A 40-man patrol climbed the summit.
- **First Flag:** Raised at 10:20 AM. Too small to be seen from ships.
- **Second Flag:** Raised hours later (for a bigger flag). **Joe Rosenthal** snapped the photo—the most reproduced photograph in history.
- **Myth:** The battle was over. **Reality:** The battle raged for 31 more days.

### The Meat Grinder
Specific locations became killing zones: "The Amphitheater," "Turkey Knob."
**Flamethrowers:** The only way to clear bunkers. (Zippo Tanks).
**Liquid Napalm:** Poured down ventilation shafts.

## The Cost vs Value Debate

**Was it worth it?**
- **Yes:** 2,251 B-29s made emergency landings on Iwo Jima before war ended. Saved ~24,000 airmen.
- **No:** The cost in Marine lives was too high for a rock. Japan surrendered due to A-Bomb, not invasion.
