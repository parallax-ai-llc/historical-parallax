## Summary

Song Qingling (Soong Ching-ling, 1893-1981) was a towering figure in 20th-century Chinese politics, serving as the wife of Republic of China founder Sun Yat-sen and later becoming Honorary President of the People's Republic of China. Born into the influential Soong family, she dedicated her life to Chinese revolution, women's rights, and social welfare, maintaining her commitment to Sun Yat-sen's principles even as China's political landscape fractured between the Nationalists and Communists. Her decision to side with the Communist Party after the Chinese Civil War made her a revered symbol in mainland China while complicating her legacy in Taiwan. Throughout her seven-decade career, she championed children's welfare, international peace, and women's emancipation, earning recognition as one of the most influential Chinese women of the modern era.

## Early Life and Background

Song Qingling was born on January 27, 1893, in Shanghai, into one of China's most prominent families. Her father, Charlie Soong (Song Jiashu), was a wealthy businessman and Methodist minister who had studied in the United States and became a key financial supporter of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary movement. Her mother, Ni Guizhen, came from a prosperous Christian family. The Soong family's wealth, Western education, and Christian faith positioned them uniquely at the intersection of traditional Chinese society and modern Western influences during a period of profound transformation in China.[^1][^2]

Growing up in Shanghai's International Settlement, Song Qingling received an education that blended Chinese and Western traditions. She attended the McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai, a Methodist institution where classes were conducted in English. This early exposure to Western ideas, combined with her father's revolutionary connections, shaped her progressive worldview from childhood. The Soong household frequently hosted revolutionary figures, exposing young Qingling to discussions of political reform and national salvation.[^3][^4]

In 1908, at age fifteen, Song Qingling followed her older sister Soong Ai-ling to the United States to continue her education. She enrolled at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, one of the oldest women's colleges in the world. During her five years in America, she studied English literature and music, graduating in 1913. Her time at Wesleyan exposed her to suffragette movements and progressive political thought, experiences that would profoundly influence her later advocacy for women's rights. She was known among her classmates as intelligent, reserved, and deeply committed to China's modernization.[^5][^6]

The Soong family's three daughters would all marry prominent Chinese political figures, leading to the famous saying that "one loved money, one loved power, and one loved China"—referring respectively to Ai-ling (who married finance minister H.H. Kung), Meiling (who married Chiang Kai-shek), and Qingling herself. This characterization, while overly simplistic, captured the divergent paths the sisters would take in China's turbulent political landscape. Qingling's upbringing in this remarkable family gave her unprecedented access to China's revolutionary elite while instilling in her a sense of duty to her nation's transformation.[^7][^8]

## Rise to Power

Song Qingling's ascent to political prominence began with her return to China in 1913, shortly after the establishment of the Republic of China. She joined her father in supporting Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary activities and began working as Sun's English-language secretary in Japan, where he was in exile following Yuan Shikai's betrayal of the republican cause. During this period, working closely with Sun Yat-sen despite their twenty-seven-year age difference, a romantic relationship developed between the revolutionary leader and his young secretary.[^9][^10]

In October 1915, Song Qingling and Sun Yat-sen married in Tokyo, a union that shocked both families and Chinese society. Sun had divorced his first wife, Lu Muzhen, who had borne him three children, to marry Qingling. Her parents vehemently opposed the match due to the age gap, Sun's divorced status, and concerns about the appropriateness of the relationship. Charlie Soong reportedly felt betrayed that Sun, whom he had supported financially and politically for years, would pursue his daughter. Nevertheless, at age twenty-two, Song Qingling chose to marry Sun, demonstrating the independence and commitment to principle that would characterize her entire life.[^11][^12]

As Sun Yat-sen's wife and political partner, Song Qingling gained immediate prominence in revolutionary circles. She served not merely as a spouse but as an active political collaborator, assisting with Sun's correspondence, translating documents, and participating in strategic discussions. During the tumultuous period of warlordism that fragmented China in the 1920s, she accompanied Sun through numerous political and military campaigns, including dangerous situations that threatened their lives. Her courage during the June 1922 bombardment of their residence in Guangzhou, when she helped Sun escape while remaining behind to protect important documents, earned her widespread admiration.[^13][^14]

Sun Yat-sen's death from cancer on March 12, 1925, was a devastating personal loss for Song Qingling, but it paradoxically elevated her political standing. As the widow of the "Father of the Nation," she became the keeper of his revolutionary legacy and principles, a role she would maintain for the rest of her life. She assumed the position of guardian of Sun's Three Principles of the People (nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood), which both the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang or KMT) and the Communist Party claimed to uphold. This gave her unique moral authority in Chinese politics as the nation's revolutionary movements increasingly diverged.[^15][^16]

Following the 1927 split between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Song Qingling made a decision that would define her political trajectory. When her brother-in-law Chiang Kai-shek, who had married her younger sister Soong Meiling, launched a violent purge of communists in Shanghai, she publicly denounced the Nationalist government's betrayal of Sun Yat-sen's principles. She went into self-imposed exile in Moscow from 1927 to 1929, signaling her break with the KMT and beginning her gradual alignment with the CCP. This courageous stand against her own family's political faction established her as a figure of integrity who placed principle above personal advantage.[^17][^18]

## Major Achievements

Song Qingling's most significant achievement was her lifelong advocacy for children's welfare and education in China. In 1938, she founded the China Defense League (later renamed the China Welfare Institute in 1950), an organization dedicated to providing medical care, education, and relief to children affected by war and poverty. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), she used her international connections to raise funds and supplies for Chinese resistance efforts, particularly focusing on children in war zones. The China Welfare Institute would become one of China's most important charitable organizations, establishing nurseries, kindergartens, and children's health facilities throughout the country.[^19][^20]

Her work in women's rights and emancipation represented another major contribution to Chinese society. Song Qingling was a founding member and leader of numerous women's organizations, including the All-China Women's Federation, established in 1949. She advocated tirelessly for women's education, economic independence, legal equality, and political participation. Her own life served as an example of female agency and independence in a society traditionally dominated by patriarchal structures. She wrote and spoke extensively on the need to eliminate feudal attitudes toward women and to integrate women fully into national development efforts.[^21][^22]

In the realm of international diplomacy and peace activism, Song Qingling achieved global recognition. She served as vice-president of the World Peace Council and was actively involved in international peace movements throughout the Cold War era. Despite her alignment with the Communist bloc, she maintained relationships with progressive figures worldwide and advocated for nuclear disarmament, decolonization, and international cooperation. Her international stature helped legitimize the People's Republic of China in global forums during periods when the PRC faced diplomatic isolation, particularly in the 1950s and 1960s.[^23][^24]

Song Qingling played a crucial symbolic role in the early years of the People's Republic of China. When the PRC was established on October 1, 1949, she was appointed to several prestigious positions, including Vice-Chairwoman of the Central People's Government and Vice-Chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. While these positions were largely ceremonial, her presence lent legitimacy to the Communist government by linking it to Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary legacy. She participated in major state functions and served as an important bridge between the new Communist leadership and non-Communist progressive forces who respected her integrity and historical credentials.[^25][^26]

Her establishment of progressive publications also marked a significant achievement. Song Qingling founded and supported several magazines and journals aimed at promoting children's welfare, women's rights, and international understanding. These publications included "China Reconstructs" (later renamed "China Today"), which presented China's development to international audiences, and various children's magazines that promoted literacy and progressive values. Through these editorial platforms, she shaped public discourse and promoted her vision of a modern, equitable China.[^27][^28]

Song Qingling's advocacy for medical advancement and public health deserves recognition as well. She was instrumental in promoting the expansion of maternal and child health services in China and supported the integration of traditional Chinese medicine with Western medical practices. During the war years and after, she worked to establish hospitals and clinics, particularly in rural areas where medical services were scarce. Her China Welfare Institute sponsored medical training programs and helped professionalize pediatric care in China.[^29][^30]

Perhaps her most enduring achievement was maintaining the moral high ground in China's bitter political divisions. Unlike many political figures who became compromised or corrupted during China's revolutionary period, Song Qingling consistently maintained her principles even when doing so put her at odds with powerful figures, including her own family members. Her refusal to support Chiang Kai-shek's authoritarian turn, her consistent advocacy for the poor and marginalized, and her dedication to Sun Yat-sen's original revolutionary vision earned her respect across political divides. This moral consistency made her one of the few figures from the Republican era who retained honor and dignity throughout the Communist period.[^31][^32]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Song Qingling's decision to align with the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Republic of China remains her most controversial legacy. Critics, particularly in Taiwan and among anti-Communist Chinese diaspora communities, viewed her support for Mao Zedong's regime as a betrayal of Sun Yat-sen's democratic principles. They argued that Sun's vision emphasized democracy and constitutionalism, values fundamentally incompatible with Communist totalitarianism. Her high-profile presence at Communist Party functions and state ceremonies was seen as lending credibility to a regime responsible for numerous political campaigns, purges, and human rights violations.[^33][^34]

During the Great Leap Forward (1958-1962) and the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), periods of immense suffering and death for millions of Chinese, Song Qingling maintained her position within the Communist government and made no known public criticism of these disastrous policies. The Great Leap Forward's forced collectivization and unrealistic production targets led to the Great Chinese Famine, which caused an estimated 15-55 million deaths. The Cultural Revolution unleashed political persecution, destroyed cultural heritage, and traumatized an entire generation. Song Qingling's silence during these catastrophes has been interpreted by critics as complicity or, at best, moral cowardice. Some historians argue that her privileged position insulated her from the suffering of ordinary Chinese and compromised her moral authority.[^35][^36]

Her relationship with her family, particularly her sister Soong Meiling (Madame Chiang Kai-shek), highlighted the deep political divisions her choices created. The Soong sisters' opposing allegiances—Qingling supporting the Communists while Meiling stood with the Nationalists—symbolized China's civil war divisions within a single family. Critics on both sides viewed this estrangement as evidence of the destructive nature of ideological conflict. In Taiwan, Song Qingling was long vilified as a traitor to the Republic of China, while some observers worldwide questioned how someone committed to national unity could accept such a fundamental family rupture.[^37][^38]

Questions have been raised about the extent of Song Qingling's actual political influence versus her symbolic role. Despite her prestigious titles—including Honorary President of the People's Republic of China, a position created for her just before her death—critics note that she wielded little real power within the Communist Party structure. She was never a member of the Chinese Communist Party until her deathbed admission in 1981, remaining technically a non-party figure throughout her career. Skeptics argue that she served primarily as a decorative figurehead, lending respectability to Communist rule while having minimal input on actual policy decisions.[^39][^40]

Some historians have questioned the authenticity of certain aspects of her revolutionary credentials. While she certainly participated in dangerous activities alongside Sun Yat-sen, critics note that her elite background and Western education separated her from the mass revolutionary movements she claimed to support. Unlike Communist leaders who experienced the Long March or peasant revolutionaries who came from poverty, Song Qingling's revolutionary experience was mediated through her privileged position. This gap between her background and the masses she advocated for has been cited as evidence of disconnect between her rhetoric and reality.[^41][^42]

Her acceptance of awards and honors from Communist-bloc countries during the Cold War drew criticism from those who viewed these regimes as oppressive. She received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1951 (later renamed the Lenin Peace Prize) and numerous other honors from Soviet-aligned nations. Critics argued that accepting recognition from Stalinist regimes undermined her stated commitment to peace and human welfare, given the extensive documented human rights abuses in these countries. Her willingness to associate with authoritarian Communist governments suggested to detractors that her political judgment was flawed or that she prioritized ideological alignment over genuine humanitarian concerns.[^43][^44]

The effectiveness and impact of her charitable work has also faced scrutiny. While the China Welfare Institute accomplished significant work in children's welfare, critics point out that such charitable activities served the Communist Party's propaganda purposes by presenting a humanitarian face for the regime. Some analysts suggest that her welfare work, while beneficial to recipients, ultimately helped legitimize a political system that created much of the poverty and suffering she sought to alleviate. The question of whether her humanitarian efforts justified or compensated for her political associations remains contested.[^45][^46]

## Personal Life

Song Qingling's marriage to Sun Yat-sen, though controversial at its inception, became the defining relationship of her life. Despite the twenty-seven-year age difference and the scandal surrounding Sun's divorce, their marriage was reportedly one of genuine affection and intellectual partnership. Sun treated Qingling as a political equal, seeking her counsel on important decisions and relying on her linguistic skills and organizational abilities. The couple had no children, though Song Qingling served as a stepmother figure to Sun's children from his first marriage, with varying degrees of success. After Sun's death in 1925, she never remarried, maintaining her identity as Sun Yat-sen's widow for the remaining fifty-six years of her life.[^47][^48]

Her relationship with her family, particularly her siblings, was complex and often strained by political divisions. The three Soong sisters—Ai-ling, Qingling, and Meiling—took dramatically different paths despite their shared upbringing. Ai-ling married H.H. Kung, becoming one of China's wealthiest women and focusing on financial matters. Meiling married Chiang Kai-shek and became First Lady of the Republic of China, eventually fleeing to Taiwan after the Communist victory. The sisters' political disagreements created deep rifts, though there were occasional reconciliation attempts. Song Qingling's relationship with her brother T.V. Soong, who served as finance minister under Chiang Kai-shek, was similarly complicated by political differences.[^49][^50]

Friends and colleagues described Song Qingling as dignified, reserved, and intensely private. Unlike her more outgoing sister Meiling, who embraced the spotlight and excelled at public relations, Qingling maintained a more understated presence. She was known for her elegance, always dressing impeccably in traditional qipao (cheongsam) dresses that became her signature style. Those who worked with her noted her fierce dedication to her causes, attention to detail in charitable work, and loyalty to those she considered allies. She could be stubborn when her principles were challenged, refusing to compromise on matters she considered fundamental.[^51][^52]

Her living situation reflected her unique position in Chinese society and politics. After 1949, she lived in a comfortable residence in Beijing provided by the Communist government, maintaining a lifestyle that, while not lavish by international standards, was privileged compared to ordinary Chinese citizens. She employed staff, entertained foreign dignitaries, and had access to resources unavailable to most Chinese during periods of scarcity. This privileged existence created some cognitive dissonance with her stated commitment to egalitarian principles, though supporters argued that her contributions to the nation justified such treatment.[^53][^54]

Song Qingling's interests beyond politics included literature, music, and animals. She was an accomplished pianist and maintained her love of music throughout her life. She kept pets, particularly dogs, and was known among friends for her affection toward animals. She read voraciously in both Chinese and English, keeping up with international publications and maintaining correspondence with progressive intellectuals worldwide. These personal interests provided some respite from the demanding political and charitable work that consumed most of her energy.[^55][^56]

Her health declined significantly in her final years, suffering from leukemia and other ailments. In May 1981, as her condition deteriorated, the Communist Party leadership made the symbolic gesture of admitting her as a full member of the Chinese Communist Party, a status she had never formally held despite decades of association. Two weeks later, they bestowed upon her the title of Honorary President of the People's Republic of China, a position created specifically for her. She died on May 29, 1981, in Beijing at the age of eighty-eight. Her state funeral was one of the most elaborate in PRC history, attended by the entire Communist Party leadership and marking the end of an era in Chinese revolutionary politics.[^57][^58]

## Legacy

Song Qingling's legacy in the People's Republic of China is overwhelmingly positive, with her image carefully cultivated as a revolutionary hero and symbol of patriotic dedication. She is honored as one of the "Three Great Revolutionary Women" alongside Cai Chang and Deng Yingchao. Numerous institutions bear her name, including the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, schools, hospitals, and children's centers throughout China. Her former residences in Beijing and Shanghai have been preserved as museums, attracting thousands of visitors annually. The Communist Party presents her as proof that Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary legacy naturally led to Communist victory, using her support to legitimize their claim to be the true inheritors of the Republican Revolution.[^59][^60]

In Taiwan and among overseas Chinese communities opposed to Communist rule, her legacy is far more contested. For decades after 1949, she was viewed in Taiwan as a traitor who betrayed the Republic of China and Sun Yat-sen's democratic principles. Taiwanese textbooks portrayed her negatively or omitted her entirely from historical narratives. However, attitudes have evolved somewhat since Taiwan's democratization in the 1990s, with more nuanced assessments acknowledging her humanitarian work while critiquing her political choices. Some Taiwan scholars now study her as a complex historical figure rather than simply denouncing her, though she remains controversial in Taiwanese political discourse.[^61][^62]

Her impact on women's rights and feminism in China represents perhaps her most enduring contribution. Song Qingling served as a powerful role model for Chinese women, demonstrating that women could be political actors, independent thinkers, and agents of historical change. Her advocacy for women's education, legal equality, and economic participation contributed to significant improvements in women's status in China, particularly in the early PRC period. The organizations she founded and supported continued to advance women's causes long after her death. Contemporary Chinese feminists often cite her as an inspiration, even when they disagree with her political choices.[^63][^64]

The children's welfare institutions she established continue to operate and expand their reach. The China Welfare Institute, Song Qingling's most important organizational legacy, runs kindergartens, schools, children's palaces, and youth programs serving millions of Chinese children. The Soong Ching Ling Foundation, established in 1982 shortly after her death, carries forward her work in children's welfare, education, and international cultural exchange. These institutions have provided tangible benefits to countless Chinese families, making her humanitarian legacy concrete and measurable beyond symbolic politics.[^65][^66]

Internationally, Song Qingling is remembered as a significant figure in 20th-century peace movements and international progressive politics. Her work with the World Peace Council and other international organizations helped connect Chinese progressive movements with global leftist networks during the Cold War. She facilitated cultural exchanges and promoted understanding of China among international audiences. While her international reputation was inevitably shaped by Cold War politics, many progressive activists worldwide viewed her as a genuine humanitarian and advocate for peace, regardless of their positions on Chinese Communism.[^67][^68]

Scholarly assessments of Song Qingling vary widely depending on the historian's perspective and political orientation. Western scholars have produced nuanced biographies that acknowledge both her genuine commitment to progressive causes and her complicity with an authoritarian regime. Chinese scholars in the PRC tend to produce hagiographic accounts that emphasize her revolutionary credentials while downplaying contradictions. Recent historical work has attempted to place her within the broader context of Republican-era elite women who navigated China's revolutionary transformation, comparing her choices with those of other educated Chinese women of her generation.[^69][^70]

Her life raises enduring questions about political compromise, moral consistency, and the relationship between ends and means in revolutionary politics. Supporters argue that she remained true to Sun Yat-sen's anti-imperialist, pro-poor principles even as circumstances changed around her, and that supporting the CCP was a principled choice given the KMT's corruption and authoritarianism. Critics contend that she sacrificed democratic values for a flawed ideology and that her association with Communist atrocities tarnished whatever humanitarian work she accomplished. This debate continues to shape how different communities remember and interpret her life.[^71][^72]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Admirers of Song Qingling emphasize her extraordinary courage in breaking with family, social convention, and political pressure to pursue her principles. Her decision to marry Sun Yat-sen despite parental opposition demonstrated early independence, while her later break with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist government—which put her at odds with her own sisters and placed her in physical danger—showed remarkable moral fortitude. Biographer Jung Chang and others have noted that Song Qingling repeatedly chose principle over personal advantage, refusing lucrative opportunities to align with the Nationalist government that would have brought wealth and safety.[^73][^74]

Supporters highlight her genuine commitment to social welfare and her practical achievements in improving children's lives in China. Unlike many political figures whose humanitarian rhetoric remained abstract, Song Qingling established concrete institutions that delivered real services to vulnerable populations. The China Welfare Institute's programs in healthcare, education, and child development served millions of children during periods of war and poverty. Scholars who have studied her charitable work note her hands-on involvement, attention to programmatic details, and long-term commitment to these causes spanning several decades.[^75][^76]

Her role as a bridge between different political factions and eras is viewed positively by historians who emphasize continuity in Chinese revolutionary history. Song Qingling maintained personal relationships and political dialogue with various groups—Communists, non-Communist progressives, and even some Nationalist figures—throughout her career. This bridging function helped reduce polarization and preserved channels of communication during China's political fragmentation. Her presence in the early PRC government helped reassure non-Communist intellectuals and progressive figures that the new regime would include diverse voices.[^77][^78]

Feminist scholars particularly celebrate Song Qingling as a pioneer of women's emancipation in China. She lived her life according to principles of female agency and independence at a time when Chinese women faced tremendous social constraints. Her writings on women's issues addressed fundamental questions of gender equality, economic independence, and political participation. She mentored younger women activists and used her platform to advance women's causes consistently throughout her career. Modern Chinese feminists often cite her as demonstrating that women could be central actors in revolutionary transformation rather than peripheral participants.[^76][^77]

Defenders of her political choices argue that the Chinese Communist Party, despite its flaws, represented the best hope for addressing China's poverty, imperialism, and social inequality in the mid-20th century. From this perspective, Song Qingling correctly assessed that the Nationalist government had become corrupt and authoritarian, offering no viable path to national renewal. Her support for the CCP was not blind loyalty but a calculated judgment that, whatever its shortcomings, Communist rule offered better prospects for the Chinese masses than continued Nationalist governance or fragmentation among warlords. Historians sympathetic to this view note that many progressive intellectuals worldwide made similar assessments of socialist movements during this era.[^80][^81]

International admirers emphasize her contribution to peace movements and international understanding during the dangerous Cold War period. Her work with the World Peace Council and other organizations promoted dialogue and reduced international tensions during periods of potential nuclear confrontation. She used her influence to advocate for peaceful coexistence and opposed military solutions to political problems. Progressive activists worldwide viewed her as a genuine voice for peace rather than simply a propaganda tool, citing her consistent anti-war positions across different contexts.[^82][^83]

### Negative Views

Critics fundamentally question Song Qingling's political judgment in supporting a Communist regime that would eventually cause immense suffering to the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party's various political campaigns—including the Anti-Rightist Campaign, Great Leap Forward, and Cultural Revolution—resulted in tens of millions of deaths and destroyed the lives of countless families. By lending her prestige to this regime and remaining silent during its worst excesses, critics argue, Song Qingling became complicit in these atrocities. Her symbolic importance to the regime's legitimacy makes her particularly culpable in this assessment.[^84][^85]

Skeptics note the contradiction between her stated principles and her political associations. She claimed to uphold Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, which included democracy and constitutional government, yet supported a one-party dictatorship that suppressed political freedom, censored speech, and eliminated opposition. This glaring inconsistency suggests either profound political naiveté or cynical opportunism. Critics argue that genuine commitment to democratic principles would have required opposing Communist totalitarianism as firmly as she opposed Nationalist authoritarianism.[^86][^87]

Her privileged lifestyle within Communist China while millions suffered poverty and persecution strikes critics as hypocritical. While ordinary Chinese endured forced collectivization, political persecution, and material deprivation, Song Qingling lived comfortably in state-provided residences with servants, access to foreign goods, and freedom to travel internationally. This disparity between her revolutionary rhetoric and personal circumstances undermines claims of genuine solidarity with the masses. Some historians suggest her elite background ultimately prevented her from truly understanding or sharing the experiences of ordinary Chinese people.[^88][^89]

Conservative scholars and anti-Communist critics view her as a propaganda asset who was cynically manipulated by Communist leadership. From this perspective, the CCP valued her primarily for symbolic purposes—as Sun Yat-sen's widow and a link to Republican legitimacy—rather than for any substantive political contribution. Her various titles and positions, while prestigious, carried little actual power. The party's deathbed admission of her to party membership and creation of the "Honorary President" title are seen as cynical gestures that exploited her even in her final days. This interpretation suggests she was more victim than villain, though a willing victim whose vanity was exploited.[^90][^91]

Her estrangement from family members who chose different political paths is viewed critically by those who value family loyalty and personal relationships over ideology. The fact that she maintained political opposition to her sisters and brothers, leading to decades of separation and mutual denunciation, suggests a troubling prioritization of abstract political commitments over concrete human relationships. Critics argue that political ideology should not sever fundamental family bonds and that her choices reflected the destructive nature of totalitarian thinking.[^92][^93]

Historians critical of her legacy note that her charitable work, while beneficial to direct recipients, ultimately served the Communist Party's propaganda purposes. The China Welfare Institute and similar organizations presented a humanitarian face for a regime engaged in systematic human rights violations. Her welfare activities helped deflect international criticism and provided cover for oppressive policies. From this perspective, her humanitarian work was instrumentalized by the regime and cannot be separated from the broader political context in which it operated.[^94][^95]

Some critics question whether she genuinely believed Communist ideology or simply made pragmatic calculations about power. Her refusal to join the Communist Party until her deathbed suggests possible private reservations about Communist doctrine. Skeptics argue that she may have supported the CCP primarily because they won the civil war and controlled China, rather than from deep ideological conviction. This interpretation portrays her as more opportunistic than principled, adapting her rhetoric to align with whoever held power.[^96][^97]
