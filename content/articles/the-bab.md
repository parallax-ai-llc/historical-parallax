## Summary

The Bab (Siyyid Ali Muhammad Shirazi) was the founder of Babism and the forerunner of the Baha'i Faith. He declared himself the Bab (Gate) in 1844, claiming to be the return of the Twelfth Imam and heralding the coming of a greater prophet. His teachings attracted thousands of followers and provoked violent persecution by the Qajar government and Shia clergy. He was executed by firing squad at the age of 30.
