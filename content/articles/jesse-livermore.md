## Summary

Jesse Livermore was one of the greatest stock traders in history, known as the 'Boy Plunger' and 'Great Bear of Wall Street.' He made and lost several fortunes through stock speculation. He famously shorted the market during the Panic of 1907 and the 1929 crash, making over $100 million. His trading strategies, documented in the classic book 'Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,' continue to influence traders today.
