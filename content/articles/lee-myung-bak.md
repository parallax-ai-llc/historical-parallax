## Summary

Lee Myung-bak (born December 19, 1941) served as the tenth president of South Korea from 2008 to 2013, bringing his business acumen from a legendary career at Hyundai Construction to the nation's highest office.[^1] Rising from crushing poverty as a child refugee to become the youngest CEO in Korean history at age 35, Lee earned the nickname "The Bulldozer" for his determination and drive.[^2] His presidency was marked by economic stewardship through the global financial crisis, controversial environmental projects, and a hardline approach to North Korea.[^3] In 2018, Lee was convicted of bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power, receiving a 17-year prison sentence that was later pardoned in 2022.[^4] His trajectory from rags to riches to imprisonment mirrors South Korea's own tumultuous journey through rapid development, democratization, and ongoing struggles with corruption.

## Early Life and Background

Lee Myung-bak was born on December 19, 1941, in Osaka, Japan, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, and was given the Japanese name Akihiro Tsukiyama (月山明博).[^5] His parents had emigrated to Japan in 1929, nineteen years after the Japanese annexation of Korea, seeking economic opportunities in the colonial power's industrial centers.[^6] Lee's father, Lee Chung-u, worked as a farm laborer in rural Japan, while his mother, Chae Tae-won, was a housewife who cared for their seven children—Lee was the fifth.[^7]

In 1945, following the end of World War II and Japan's surrender, the Lee family made the perilous journey back to Korea.[^8] Their ship was wrecked off the coast of Tsushima Island, and the family lost all their belongings, barely surviving the disaster.[^9] They landed on Korean shores with little more than the clothes on their backs and settled in Lee Chung-u's hometown of Pohang, in North Gyeongsang Province, then an American-occupied portion of the Korean Peninsula.[^10]

The family's life in Pohang was marked by extreme poverty. Lee's father took on manual labor jobs including ranch work and street vending to support the family, but these efforts were often insufficient to prevent hunger among the children.[^11] Lee recalls his childhood in the country's southeast as one of "raw and painful" poverty, with finding food being a daily struggle.[^12] The young Lee wore his school uniform all the time because his family couldn't afford to buy other clothing.[^13] To help support his family financially, Lee sold rice snacks on the streets during the day and attended school at night.[^14]

Despite these hardships, Lee's parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and can-do spirit. As Lee later reflected, "Well when I was young, actually not just me, but we were all poor. Korea used to be one of the poorest countries in the world. Despite such circumstances, I was very, very fortunate to be blessed with having parents who always instilled in a spirit of can-do spirit."[^15] This determination would define his entire career and help him overcome the obstacles of poverty and discrimination that marked his early years.

Lee enrolled at Korea University in Seoul in 1961, one of the nation's most prestigious institutions.[^16] Unable to afford tuition, he worked as a garbage collector to pay his way through university—a fact that would later become emblematic of his rise from poverty narrative.[^17] His university years were marked not only by academic achievement but also by political activism. In 1964, Lee was imprisoned for participating in student protests against the normalization of relations between South Korea and Japan.[^18] This political activism led to his being blacklisted by the South Korean government, which would significantly limit his job prospects with larger, more established firms upon graduation.[^19]

## Rise to Power

Lee Myung-bak's extraordinary rise to power began in the business world rather than in traditional politics. Upon graduating from Korea University, Lee found that his blacklisting due to student activism prevented him from securing employment with established firms.[^20] In 1965, he joined the fledgling Hyundai Construction company when it had fewer than 100 employees—a choice born partly of necessity but one that would prove transformative.[^21]

Lee's talent and work ethic propelled him rapidly through the company's ranks. He became a company director at the remarkably young age of 29, just five years after joining Hyundai.[^22] At 35, he was named CEO, becoming the youngest chief executive in Korean history—a record that stood for decades.[^23] During his tenure, Lee was responsible for securing Korea's first major overseas construction contract, to build a road in Thailand, which helped establish Hyundai as an international player.[^24] It was during his three decades with the Hyundai Group that Lee earned his famous nickname, "The Bulldozer" or "Raging Bulldozer," for his relentless determination, aggressive business tactics, and ability to overcome obstacles.[^25]

By 1988, Lee had been elevated to chairman of Hyundai Construction at age 47.[^26] When he resigned from the company in 1992 after a 27-year career, Hyundai Group had grown from a small construction firm to a massive conglomerate employing approximately 160,000 people.[^27] Lee's business success and the wealth he accumulated made him a nationally recognized figure, embodying South Korea's own "Miracle on the Han River"—the country's rapid economic development from a war-ravaged nation to an industrialized economy.

In 1992, Lee made his transition from business to politics, successfully running for the 14th Korean National Assembly as a proportional representation member.[^28] After establishing himself in the conservative political circles, Lee set his sights on a higher-profile position. In 2002, he was elected mayor of Seoul, South Korea's capital and largest city, taking office that same year.[^29]

As Seoul's mayor from 2002 to 2006, Lee undertook an ambitious urban renewal project that would significantly enhance his political reputation and establish him as an environmentalist. His signature achievement was the Cheonggyecheon restoration project, which removed an elevated highway to uncover and restore a stream that had been paved over decades earlier.[^30] The project created a new landmark in the capital, provided recreational green space for Seoul's residents, and earned Lee substantial environmental credibility both domestically and internationally.[^31] TIME magazine even named him a "Hero of the Environment" in 2007 for this work.[^32]

Building on his success as Seoul's mayor and his business credentials as a former CEO who could manage the economy, Lee secured the Grand National Party's nomination for president in 2007. His campaign promised economic prosperity with the slogan "747"—7% economic growth, $40,000 per capita income, and making South Korea the world's seventh-largest economy.[^33] On December 19, 2007—his 66th birthday—Lee won South Korea's presidential election in a landslide victory, securing 48.7% of the vote.[^34] He was inaugurated as South Korea's tenth president on February 25, 2008, bringing his business background and CEO mentality to the nation's highest office.[^35]

## Major Achievements

Lee Myung-bak's presidency (2008-2013) was defined by several major policy initiatives and achievements, though many would later become sources of controversy. His supporters point to his economic stewardship, infrastructure development, and efforts to raise South Korea's international profile as key accomplishments during his five-year term.

**Economic Crisis Management**

Lee took office just months before the global financial crisis of 2008, which tested his economic management abilities.[^36] Drawing on his business experience, Lee implemented policies to stabilize the financial system and stimulate the economy during the worldwide recession.[^37] Under his leadership, South Korea recovered more quickly from the crisis than many developed nations, with the economy resuming growth by 2009.[^38] His administration provided fiscal stimulus while maintaining relatively disciplined public finances compared to other countries facing the crisis.[^39] Supporters credit his business background and pragmatic approach with helping South Korea navigate this economic turbulence more successfully than many Western economies.

**Strengthening International Relations**

Lee prioritized deepening South Korea's alliance with the United States, which he saw as essential for both economic prosperity and national security.[^40] His early efforts to strengthen the U.S.-Korea partnership included championing the Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA), which was ratified during his presidency and contributed to a significant rise in South Korea's exports to the United States.[^41] The agreement was one of the largest free trade deals the U.S. had entered into since NAFTA and represented a major economic achievement for Lee's administration.[^42]

In November 2010, Lee's government hosted the G-20 Seoul Summit, a major international gathering that significantly raised South Korea's profile on the world stage.[^43] South Korea became the first non-G7 nation to host the prestigious summit, symbolizing the country's emergence as a major economic power.[^44] The successful hosting of the event was seen as a diplomatic triumph and demonstrated South Korea's growing influence in global economic governance.

**Green Growth Initiative**

Lee launched an ambitious "Green New Deal" policy in January 2009, aimed at both environmental protection and economic stimulus.[^45] The initiative proposed development of renewable energy sources including solar, wind, and tidal power; stepped-up production of hybrid and electric vehicles; a national tree-planting program; and expanded railway infrastructure to reduce carbon emissions.[^46] The government estimated the program would create approximately 960,000 new jobs while transitioning South Korea toward a more sustainable economy.[^47]

In 2008, Lee laid out an agenda for a "National Strategy for Green Growth," and in February 2009 established the Presidential Committee on Green Growth to coordinate environmental policy across government agencies.[^48] These initiatives earned Lee international recognition, with TIME magazine naming him a "Hero of the Environment" in 2007 for his environmental work as Seoul's mayor.[^49]

**The Four Major Rivers Restoration Project**

The centerpiece of Lee's environmental agenda was the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project, officially announced as part of the Green New Deal in January 2009 and declared complete on October 21, 2011.[^50] The massive public works project involved dredging and restoration work on South Korea's four major rivers: the Han, Nakdong, Geum, and Yeongsan.[^51] The government argued the project would prevent floods, secure water supplies for agriculture and drinking, improve water quality, create extensive recreational areas along riverbanks, and contribute to regional economic development.[^52]

The scale of the project was enormous, with the government investing approximately 22.2 trillion won (approximately $17.3-20 billion USD) over more than two years of intensive construction from 2009 to 2011.[^53] The work included building 16 weirs (low dams), dredging river bottoms, creating bike paths and parks along riverbanks, and constructing various recreational facilities.[^54] Lee promoted the project as eco-friendly development that would harmonize environmental protection with economic growth, representing a model for sustainable infrastructure investment.[^55]

**Infrastructure Development**

Beyond the rivers project, Lee's administration invested heavily in infrastructure development throughout South Korea. His background in construction and his "Bulldozer" reputation manifested in numerous building projects, road improvements, and urban development initiatives.[^56] The government expanded high-speed rail networks, modernized ports, and invested in digital infrastructure to maintain South Korea's position as a leader in information technology.[^57]

**Defense and Security**

Following North Korean provocations including the sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010 and the artillery bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island in November 2010, Lee's government strengthened defense capabilities and revised rules of engagement to allow more robust military responses.[^58] His administration also deepened defense cooperation with the United States and Japan, though the latter proved controversial domestically given historical animosities.[^59]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, Lee Myung-bak's presidency was plagued by numerous controversies that ultimately overshadowed his accomplishments and led to his eventual criminal conviction. Critics accused him of authoritarian tendencies, environmental destruction disguised as green policy, economic policies favoring the wealthy, and ultimately, massive corruption.

**The Four Rivers Project Controversy**

While promoted as an environmental restoration initiative, the Four Major Rivers Project became the most controversial policy of Lee's presidency. Environmental experts, scientists, and civic groups mounted fierce opposition, arguing the project would cause ecological devastation rather than restoration.[^60] Critics characterized it as an environmentally destructive boondoggle designed primarily to funnel government contracts to major construction companies—including Lee's former employer Hyundai and other firms with close ties to his administration.[^61]

After completion, the project's results were widely criticized as an environmental disaster. Algae blooms proliferated in the reservoirs created by the newly built weirs, turning water green and creating health hazards.[^62] Water quality near the Nakdong River deteriorated significantly after weirs were installed, contradicting government promises of improvement.[^63] A Yale Environment 360 investigation questioned whether the project was an "economic boost or boondoggle," highlighting concerns about its massive cost and dubious benefits.[^64] Environmental groups accused the government of fabricating data, suppressing dissenting scientific opinions, and rushing construction to prevent proper environmental impact assessments.[^65]

The project saw participation from all major construction firms in South Korea, prompting widespread charges of collusion between the state and big business.[^66] Critics argued the project was essentially a massive public subsidy to the construction industry disguised as environmental policy, reflecting Lee's background and connections in that sector.[^67]

**"Mbnomics" and Economic Inequality**

Lee's economic policies, collectively dubbed "Mbnomics," initially enjoyed support but by 2011 had gained a negative reputation among many Koreans.[^68] His tax reduction plans were criticized for disproportionately benefiting the wealthy and large corporations while failing to deliver promised economic benefits to ordinary citizens.[^69] The administration's failure to provide affordable housing became a particular source of public discontent, as housing prices in Seoul and other major cities remained stubbornly high despite government promises.[^70]

Plans to privatize or merge large state-owned banks failed to materialize, disappointing pro-market supporters while alarming those concerned about protecting public assets.[^71] Even traditionally supportive constituencies turned against Lee's economic policies—businesspeople in their 50s and 60s, particularly in the construction and real estate sectors, withdrew their support after the 2010 regional elections when promised economic gains failed to materialize.[^72]

**Democratic Backsliding and Authoritarianism**

Lee's presidency saw what critics characterized as democratic backsliding and authoritarian tendencies. A 2021 academic study titled "Democracy and South Korea's Lemon Presidency" argued that Lee possessed "an unrealistic sense of superiority and became a semi-democratic ruler" despite being viewed as a champion of democracy during the 2007 election.[^73] His administration was accused of restricting press freedom, using intelligence agencies for political purposes, and suppressing dissent.[^74]

Relations with labor unions deteriorated significantly, with the government taking a hardline stance against strikes and worker activism.[^75] Critics accused Lee of governing with a CEO mentality that was inappropriate for democratic governance, treating citizens like employees and demanding compliance rather than engaging in democratic deliberation.[^76]

**North Korea Policy Failures**

Lee's approach toward North Korea marked a sharp departure from his predecessor Roh Moo-hyun's "Sunshine Policy" of engagement.[^77] Lee implemented what he called "Pragmatic Engagement," which critics characterized as essentially a hardline containment policy that demanded North Korean denuclearization before any meaningful economic cooperation could proceed.[^78] The relationship between the two Koreas remained "chilly or even hostile" during Lee's term as president.[^79]

This deterioration in inter-Korean relations culminated in serious military provocations. The sinking of the South Korean warship Cheonan in March 2010, which killed 46 sailors, and the November 2010 artillery bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island, which killed four South Koreans, represented the worst military tensions on the peninsula in decades.[^80] Critics argued Lee's hardline approach had provoked rather than deterred North Korean aggression, while supporters countered that engagement policies had failed to prevent North Korea's nuclear weapons development.[^81]

**Criminal Corruption Charges and Conviction**

The most devastating controversies emerged after Lee left office, when prosecutors launched investigations into corruption during his presidency. On March 22, 2018, Lee was arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax evasion alleged to have occurred during his time in office.[^82] The charges included embezzling 24.6 billion won ($21.7 million) from DAS, a company that prosecutors alleged Lee secretly owned, despite his denials.[^83]

On October 5, 2018, the Seoul Central District Court convicted Lee of bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power, sentencing him to 15 years in prison and ordering him to pay a 13 billion won ($11.5 million) fine.[^84] The court found that Lee had taken $5.4 million in bribes from Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest conglomerate, in exchange for granting a presidential pardon to Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, who had been convicted of embezzlement and tax evasion.[^85] Prosecutors also established that Lee accepted bribes from a spy chief and a former lawmaker, caused losses to the state coffers, and committed various other crimes.[^86]

On October 29, 2020, South Korea's Supreme Court upheld a 17-year sentence against Lee, making the conviction final.[^87] The conviction placed Lee in the company of several other former South Korean presidents who had faced corruption charges, including his immediate successor Park Geun-hye, who had been convicted just six months earlier in a separate scandal.[^88] On December 27, 2022, President Yoon Suk-yeol granted Lee a special pardon, canceling the remaining 15 years of the sentence, though the conviction itself remained on his record.[^89]

**Family Members' Involvement**

The corruption extended beyond Lee himself to his family members and close associates. Lee's wife, Kim Yoon-ok, was suspected of taking $100,000 from National Intelligence Service funds via a presidential secretary.[^90] His son-in-law Lee Sang-joo was accused of channeling some of the illicit funds.[^91] Lee's older brother, Lee Sang-deuk, who was also a politician, faced his own corruption charges.[^92] These family connections to corruption reinforced public perceptions of widespread graft during Lee's administration.

---

## Personal Life

Lee Myung-bak married Kim Yoon-ok on December 19, 1970—his 29th birthday—and the couple remained married throughout his business and political career.[^93] Kim came from a business background herself; her family ran a construction company in Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest city.[^94] The couple had four children together: one son and three daughters.[^95]

Before Lee's inauguration as president, the family lived in Gahoedong, a traditional hanok (Korean traditional house) neighborhood in Seoul.[^96] Kim Yoon-ok pursued her own educational development during Lee's business career, completing the 1st Advanced Leadership Program for Women at her alma mater in 1995.[^97] As First Lady from 2008 to 2013, Kim maintained a relatively low public profile compared to some of her predecessors and successors, focusing on traditional charitable activities and cultural promotion.[^98]

Lee is a devout Christian who regularly attended Somang Presbyterian Church in Seoul, one of the country's largest and most influential Protestant congregations.[^99] His Christian faith played a significant role in his personal life and public image, though critics sometimes accused him of using religious connections for political advantage.[^100] His religious affiliation connected him to South Korea's influential Protestant community, which forms a significant voting bloc in the country's conservative political coalition.

As a person, colleagues and observers described Lee as driven, focused, and intensely goal-oriented—characteristics that earned him his "Bulldozer" nickname during his business career.[^101] He was known for his work ethic and determination, traits he attributed to the poverty of his childhood and his parents' emphasis on perseverance.[^102] Lee often recounted stories of his impoverished youth, using them to connect with voters and illustrate his understanding of ordinary Koreans' struggles.[^103]

Lee authored an autobiography titled "The Uncharted Path" (also published as "Making Hyundai, Remaking Seoul"), which detailed his rise from poverty to the presidency.[^104] The book served both as a personal memoir and a political document, outlining his philosophy of business-oriented governance and economic development. His personal narrative of rising from a garbage collector to CEO to president became central to his political brand and appeal to voters who admired his success story.[^105]

However, Lee's personality also drew criticism. Detractors characterized him as arrogant, dismissive of criticism, and unable to accept democratic accountability after decades of hierarchical corporate leadership.[^106] His tendency to surround himself with former Hyundai colleagues and Korea University alumni—creating what critics called a "Hyundai mafia" and "Korea University mafia" in government—suggested insularity and cronyism.[^107] Academic assessments noted his "unrealistic sense of superiority," which manifested in his governing style and contributed to his administration's authoritarian tendencies.[^108]

The corruption charges that led to his imprisonment also revealed aspects of his personal character that conflicted with his public image. Prosecutors alleged that Lee had secretly maintained ownership of DAS, a company that collected billions of won while he held public office, demonstrating what they characterized as greed and dishonesty.[^109] His acceptance of bribes from Samsung and other entities, if the court findings are accurate, showed a willingness to abuse his presidential authority for personal financial gain.[^110]

After his 2018 conviction and imprisonment, Lee's public image underwent a dramatic transformation from successful businessman-turned-president to corrupt politician. His pardon in December 2022 allowed him to leave prison, but the conviction remained on his record, permanently tarnishing his legacy.[^111] In his later years, Lee has largely remained out of public life, a dramatic fall from his days as one of South Korea's most powerful and celebrated figures.

## Legacy

Lee Myung-bak's legacy is profoundly mixed and contested, with his presidency increasingly viewed as a cautionary tale about the challenges South Korean democracy faces with corruption, corporate influence in politics, and the tension between economic development and democratic governance.

**Economic Development Model**

Lee's supporters continue to credit him with successfully managing South Korea through the 2008 global financial crisis and maintaining the country's economic growth during a period of worldwide recession.[^112] His business background and pragmatic approach to economic policy, they argue, provided exactly the kind of leadership South Korea needed during the crisis.[^113] The KORUS free trade agreement and the hosting of the 2010 G-20 Summit are cited as lasting achievements that strengthened South Korea's economic position and international standing.[^114]

However, critics counter that Lee's "CEO president" model represented a fundamental misunderstanding of democratic governance.[^115] The book "Korea's CEO President: Lee Myung-bak" examines how his business background shaped his governing philosophy, for better and worse.[^116] His approach to economic policy prioritized growth and construction while allegedly neglecting inequality, environmental protection, and social welfare—criticisms that have intensified as South Korea grapples with rising inequality and social divisions.[^117]

**Environmental Disaster**

The Four Major Rivers Project remains Lee's most controversial legacy. Rather than being remembered as environmental restoration, it is widely viewed as an ecological disaster and an example of how massive government spending can cause more harm than good.[^118] The continuing problems with algae blooms, water quality degradation, and damaged ecosystems serve as physical monuments to what critics see as Lee's environmentally destructive policies masquerading as green initiatives.[^119] Environmental groups continue to call for the dismantling of the weirs and restoration of the rivers to their more natural state, viewing this as necessary to undo Lee's damage.[^120]

**Corruption and Democratic Accountability**

Lee's criminal conviction for corruption has become perhaps the most defining element of his legacy. He joined a long list of South Korean presidents who faced legal consequences after leaving office, including Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo, and his immediate successor Park Geun-hye.[^121] This pattern raises profound questions about South Korean democracy, political culture, and the accountability of powerful leaders.

Some observers argue Lee's prosecution and conviction demonstrate the strength of South Korean democracy and its commitment to holding even the most powerful accountable.[^122] The willingness to investigate, prosecute, and imprison a former president shows that no one is above the law, they contend, representing democratic progress.[^123]

Others view the pattern differently, seeing it as evidence of systemic corruption in South Korean politics and the unhealthy relationship between government and the chaebol (family-controlled conglomerates) that dominate the economy.[^124] From this perspective, Lee's corruption was not an aberration but rather representative of how business interests capture the political system, using money and influence to shape policy for private gain.[^125]

**The "Lemon Presidency" Assessment**

Academic analysis has been particularly harsh. The characterization of Lee's tenure as a "lemon presidency"—a term referring to a product that appears good initially but proves defective—has gained traction among scholars studying South Korean democracy.[^126] This assessment suggests that Lee's business success and promises of economic competence attracted voters, but his actual governance proved authoritarian, corrupt, and ultimately destructive to democratic institutions.[^127]

**North Korea Policy**

Lee's hardline approach to North Korea represented a significant break from the previous decade's engagement policy, and assessments of this shift remain contested.[^128] Supporters argue that the earlier Sunshine Policy had failed to prevent North Korean nuclear weapons development and that Lee's tougher stance was a necessary correction.[^129] Critics counter that Lee's approach increased tensions, led to military provocations, and set back the cause of eventual Korean reunification—a goal Lee himself claimed to support.[^130]

The inter-Korean relationship remained frozen throughout Lee's presidency, and his successor had to work to restore even minimal dialogue.[^131] Whether this represents a failure of Lee's policy or an inevitable consequence of North Korea's provocations remains debated among Korea policy experts.

**Personal Narrative**

One enduring element of Lee's legacy is his personal story of rising from poverty to the presidency. This narrative resonated deeply with many South Koreans, particularly older generations who remembered the country's own rise from devastation following the Korean War to becoming a developed economy.[^132] Lee's life story embodied the "Korean Dream" parallel to the American Dream—the idea that hard work and determination could overcome any obstacle.[^133]

However, his conviction for corruption severely damaged this narrative. Rather than representing meritocratic success, critics now view Lee's story as exemplifying how business success can be parlayed into political power, which is then abused for personal enrichment.[^134] The revelation that Lee allegedly maintained secret ownership of a company while serving as president contradicted his public image of having left business behind for public service.[^135]

**International Reputation**

Internationally, Lee is remembered primarily for hosting the 2010 G-20 Summit and for South Korea's economic performance during his presidency.[^136] His corruption conviction received international media coverage but did not fundamentally alter South Korea's image abroad, perhaps because such scandals involving former leaders have become almost expected in South Korean politics.[^137] Foreign policy analysts tend to view Lee's presidency as a period of stable alliance management with the United States and Japan, even if inter-Korean relations deteriorated.[^138]

**Long-term Impact**

Looking at broader historical trends, Lee's presidency may be remembered as representing the end of an era when former business executives could campaign successfully for president based primarily on their corporate achievements.[^139] His successor Park Geun-hye came from a political rather than business background, and subsequent presidents have been career politicians, prosecutors, or human rights lawyers—not CEOs.[^140] Whether this shift represents a lasting change in Korean political culture or merely a temporary reaction to Lee's failures remains to be seen.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and some scholars offer more favorable assessments of Lee Myung-bak's presidency, emphasizing his economic stewardship and pragmatic governance during challenging times. This perspective views his business background as an asset rather than a liability, arguing that his corporate experience provided valuable skills for managing the national economy.[^141]

**Economic Crisis Management**

Defenders of Lee's record point to South Korea's relatively successful navigation of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis as evidence of his effective leadership. While economies across the developed world contracted sharply and required years to recover, South Korea resumed growth more quickly and maintained lower unemployment than many Western countries.[^142] His administration's combination of fiscal stimulus and financial sector support, critics of this view acknowledge, helped stabilize the economy during the worst of the crisis.[^143]

Supporters argue that Lee's understanding of business cycles, corporate finance, and global economic trends—gained during his decades at Hyundai—enabled him to make better policy decisions than career politicians might have made.[^144] His team's quick response to the crisis and willingness to implement counter-cyclical policies demonstrated pragmatic economic management, they contend.[^145]

**Infrastructure Investment**

From this perspective, Lee's emphasis on infrastructure development, including the controversial Four Rivers Project, represented necessary investment in South Korea's physical foundation.[^146] Supporters argue that the project addressed real needs for flood control, water supply, and recreational facilities, even if implementation had some problems.[^147] They point to the economic activity generated by construction projects as having provided employment and economic stimulus during the global recession.[^148]

The Cheonggyecheon stream restoration in Seoul, completed during his mayoralty, continues to be cited as a successful example of urban renewal that balanced development with environmental restoration.[^149] This project, defenders argue, showed Lee's ability to execute large infrastructure projects successfully when given proper support and planning time.[^150]

**International Standing**

Lee's supporters emphasize his success in raising South Korea's international profile through hosting the 2010 G-20 Summit and strengthening the alliance with the United States through the KORUS FTA.[^151] These achievements, they argue, cemented South Korea's position as a major player in global economic governance and strengthened the security relationship that protects the country from North Korean threats.[^152]

The emphasis on environmental issues and green growth, even if imperfectly implemented, demonstrated Lee's awareness of global trends and his attempt to position South Korea as a leader in sustainable development.[^153] His recognition as a "Hero of the Environment" by TIME magazine in 2007 reflected international acknowledgment of his environmental initiatives as Seoul mayor.[^154]

**Personal Accomplishment**

Admirers of Lee's personal story continue to view his rise from poverty to the presidency as genuinely inspiring and representative of South Korea's own economic miracle.[^155] His success at Hyundai was real and significant, they argue, demonstrating exceptional business acumen and leadership ability.[^156] The "Bulldozer" nickname, from this perspective, represented determination and ability to overcome obstacles rather than authoritarian tendencies.[^157]

Some defenders argue that the corruption charges against Lee were politically motivated, part of a pattern in South Korean politics where incoming administrations prosecute their predecessors.[^158] They point to the pardon he received in 2022 as evidence that his crimes, if they occurred, were not as serious as initially portrayed.[^159]

**Comparative Context**

Defenders also place Lee's record in comparative context, noting that many of the problems attributed to his presidency—corruption, authoritarian tendencies, controversial policies—have characterized other South Korean administrations as well.[^160] From this view, Lee was no worse than his predecessors and may have been more effective than some at managing the economy and maintaining international relationships.[^161]

### Negative Views

Critics and many scholars offer harsh assessments of Lee Myung-bak's presidency, viewing it as a period of democratic backsliding, environmental destruction, and ultimately corruption that betrayed the public trust. This perspective has gained strength following his criminal conviction and has become increasingly dominant in academic and media discourse about his legacy.[^162]

**Authoritarian Governance**

The characterization of Lee's presidency as "semi-democratic" or authoritarian has been extensively documented by scholars studying South Korean democracy.[^163] Critics point to his administration's suppression of media freedom, use of intelligence agencies for political purposes, and heavy-handed treatment of labor unions and civic organizations as evidence of authoritarian inclinations.[^164] The "lemon presidency" framework suggests that Lee's business background led him to govern in a hierarchical, top-down manner inappropriate for democratic governance.[^165]

Academic studies have concluded that Lee possessed "an unrealistic sense of superiority" that manifested in his unwillingness to accept criticism or engage in genuine democratic deliberation.[^166] His tendency to surround himself with former Hyundai colleagues and Korea University alumni created echo chambers that insulated him from dissenting views and reinforced his own biases.[^167]

**Environmental Destruction**

The Four Rivers Project is widely viewed by environmental experts and scientists as an ecological disaster that caused massive harm under the guise of environmental restoration.[^168] The proliferation of toxic algae blooms, degradation of water quality, destruction of riverside ecosystems, and enormous financial cost are cited as evidence that the project was fundamentally misconceived.[^169] Environmental groups and scientists argue that Lee ignored expert advice, suppressed dissenting opinions, and rushed construction to prevent proper environmental impact assessment.[^170]

Critics characterize the project as primarily a massive subsidy to the construction industry—Lee's former sector—rather than a genuine environmental initiative.[^171] The involvement of all major construction firms and the 22 trillion won price tag suggest that the project was designed to benefit corporate interests rather than the public good.[^172] From this perspective, the "Green New Deal" branding was cynical greenwashing that obscured environmentally destructive development.[^173]

**Economic Inequality and Failed Promises**

The failure of "Mbnomics" to deliver promised prosperity for ordinary Koreans has been extensively documented.[^174] Lee's campaign promise of "747"—7% growth, $40,000 per capita income, and becoming the seventh-largest economy—was never achieved, and critics argue it was never realistic.[^175] Tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy failed to generate the promised trickle-down benefits, while housing remained unaffordable for young Koreans trying to start families.[^176]

The withdrawal of support from traditionally conservative constituencies, including businesspeople in construction and real estate, demonstrated that even those who should have benefited from Lee's policies were disappointed by the results.[^177] Rising inequality during his presidency contradicted his campaign rhetoric about shared prosperity and economic opportunity.[^178]

**Systematic Corruption**

Lee's conviction for bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power represents the most damning assessment of his presidency.[^179] The court findings that he embezzled billions of won, took bribes from Samsung, and abused his presidential authority for personal enrichment revealed systematic corruption at the highest levels of government.[^180] The involvement of his family members, including his wife and son-in-law, in receiving illicit funds suggested that corruption permeated his inner circle.[^181]

Critics argue that Lee's corruption was not merely personal failing but reflected the broader problem of corporate capture of South Korean politics.[^182] His granting of a presidential pardon to Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee in exchange for bribes exemplified how business interests could purchase favorable government action, undermining democratic governance and the rule of law.[^183]

**North Korea Policy Failure**

Lee's hardline approach to North Korea resulted in the worst inter-Korean tensions in decades, including deadly military provocations that killed 50 South Koreans.[^184] Critics argue that his abandonment of engagement policies and demands for complete denuclearization before any cooperation were unrealistic and counterproductive.[^185] The freezing of inter-Korean dialogue and economic cooperation represented a lost opportunity for gradual progress toward eventual reunification.[^186]

**Democratic Regression**

Broader assessments place Lee's presidency within the context of democratic challenges in South Korea and globally. The "lemon presidency" analysis suggests that voters chose Lee based on his business success and promises of competent economic management, only to receive authoritarian governance and corruption.[^187] This dynamic—where candidates campaign as technocratic problem-solvers but govern in authoritarian and corrupt ways—represents a broader challenge for democracies.[^188]

Lee's presidency demonstrated the risks of electing business executives to political office without proper vetting of their democratic commitments and understanding of constitutional governance.[^189] His corporate management style, valuable in a hierarchical business organization, proved destructive when applied to democratic governance that requires transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to citizens rather than shareholders.[^190]

**Historical Verdict**

The negative historical assessment has become increasingly dominant, particularly after Lee's conviction. While some supporters continue to defend aspects of his record, the combination of authoritarian governance, environmental destruction, failed economic promises, and ultimately criminal corruption has severely damaged his historical reputation.[^191] Future historians are likely to view Lee's presidency as a cautionary tale about corruption, the dangers of corporate influence in politics, and the fragility of democratic norms and institutions.[^192]
