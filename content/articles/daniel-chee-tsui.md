## Summary

Daniel Chee Tsui is a Chinese-born American physicist who shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect. This discovery revealed a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally charged excitations. He was born in Henan Province, China, and moved to the United States for graduate study. His work opened new understanding of quantum physics in two-dimensional electron systems.
