## Summary

James Buchanan Duke built the American Tobacco Company into a monopoly controlling nearly the entire U.S. tobacco industry. He pioneered the use of cigarette-rolling machines and aggressive marketing. The Supreme Court dissolved his trust in 1911. He then built Duke Energy (originally Duke Power) and endowed Duke University with a $40 million gift that transformed it from a small college into a major research university.
