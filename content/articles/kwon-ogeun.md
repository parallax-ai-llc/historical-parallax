## Summary

O-Gon Kwon (권오곤, born September 2, 1953) is a distinguished South Korean jurist who made history as the first Korean judge to serve at a United Nations international tribunal.[^1] He is best known for presiding over the trial of Radovan Karadžić, the former Bosnian Serb leader convicted of genocide, and for serving as Vice-President of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) from 2008 to 2011.[^2] Kwon later served as President of the Assembly of States Parties to the International Criminal Court from 2017 to 2021, becoming only the second person from the Asia-Pacific region to hold this position.[^3] His 15-year tenure at the ICTY and subsequent leadership in international criminal justice institutions have established him as one of Asia's most prominent figures in international law.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

O-Gon Kwon was born on September 2, 1953, in Cheongju, Chungcheongbuk-do, South Korea.[^5] Growing up in post-Korean War South Korea during a period of rapid economic development and political transformation, Kwon demonstrated exceptional academic abilities from an early age. He attended Gyeonggi High School, one of Korea's most prestigious secondary schools, graduating in 1972.[^6] His formative years coincided with South Korea's authoritarian period under Park Chung-hee, a time when the rule of law was frequently subordinated to political considerations—an experience that would later inform his commitment to judicial independence and international justice.[^7]

Kwon's academic excellence continued at Seoul National University, South Korea's premier institution of higher education, where he enrolled in the College of Law. He graduated at the top of his class in 1976, demonstrating mastery of both Korean civil law traditions and comparative legal systems.[^8] His outstanding academic performance positioned him as one of the brightest legal minds of his generation. In 1977, at the age of 24, Kwon achieved the remarkable feat of passing the 19th Korean Bar Examination with the highest score in the nation—an accomplishment that would set the trajectory for his distinguished legal career.[^9] This achievement was particularly significant given the extreme competitiveness of the Korean bar exam, which typically has a pass rate of less than 5 percent.

Following his bar examination success, Kwon entered the Judicial Research and Training Institute (9th class), where he completed his judicial training with the highest honors, graduating at the top of his class in 1979.[^10] This triple achievement—graduating first from Seoul National University Law School, passing the bar exam with the highest score, and completing judicial training as valedictorian—marked him as an exceptional talent within Korea's legal establishment. These achievements opened doors to the most prestigious positions in Korean jurisprudence and set the foundation for his later international career.

## Rise to Prominence in Korean Judiciary

Upon completing his judicial training in 1979, Kwon was appointed as a judge in the Korean judiciary, beginning his service at the Seoul Civil District Court.[^11] His early judicial career demonstrated both intellectual rigor and careful attention to legal procedure. During the early 1980s, while serving as a young judge, Kwon was selected for a prestigious position in the presidential administration, serving as Assistant Legal Advisor (Legal Research Officer) to the President of the Republic of Korea from 1981 to 1984.[^12] This role placed him at the intersection of law and politics during a turbulent period in Korean history, providing valuable experience in constitutional matters and executive governance.

Recognizing the importance of international legal education, Kwon pursued advanced studies at Harvard Law School in the United States, earning his LL.M. degree in 1985.[^13] This international experience exposed him to common law traditions and comparative legal analysis, complementing his civil law background and broadening his jurisprudential perspective. Upon returning to Korea, he continued to advance through the judicial ranks, serving in increasingly senior positions. He later completed an LL.M. at the Graduate School of Seoul National University in 1983, further deepening his expertise in Korean law.[^14]

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Kwon held numerous important judicial positions within the Korean court system. He served as Planning Director at the Office of the Court Administration of the Supreme Court of Korea from 1990 to 1992, where he was involved in judicial administration and policy development.[^15] Between 1993 and 1999, he served as a Presiding Judge in the Changwon, Suwon, and Seoul District Courts, presiding over complex civil and criminal cases.[^16] From 1997 to 1999, he held the position of Director of Research at the Constitutional Court of Korea, where he contributed to constitutional jurisprudence and the development of Korea's democratic legal framework.[^17]

By the late 1990s, Kwon had established himself as one of Korea's most respected jurists, with over two decades of judicial experience spanning trial courts, court administration, constitutional analysis, and presidential legal advisory roles. His reputation for legal scholarship, judicial integrity, and international perspective made him an ideal candidate when the United Nations began seeking qualified judges for its international criminal tribunals. In 2001, the international community would call upon his expertise for an unprecedented role.

## International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (2001-2016)

On November 17, 2001, O-Gon Kwon was sworn in as a permanent judge of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), becoming the first Korean and one of the first Asian jurists to serve at a UN international criminal tribunal.[^18] His appointment represented a significant milestone not only for his personal career but for Korea's emergence as a contributor to international judicial institutions. The ICTY had been established by the UN Security Council in 1993 to prosecute serious crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.[^19]

Judge Kwon arrived at The Hague at a critical moment in the tribunal's history. As he later reflected, "The novelty of the issues and the procedural law we had to devise were among the most interesting experiences. As an international tribunal, we were a hybrid system which incorporated both common law and civil law. We had no precedent to work from."[^20] This challenge of creating jurisprudence in real-time, while balancing different legal traditions, would define much of his work at the ICTY.

### The Milošević Trial

One of Judge Kwon's earliest and most prominent assignments was serving on the Trial Chamber for the prosecution of Slobodan Milošević, the former President of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.[^21] The trial commenced on February 12, 2002, with Judge Kwon sitting alongside Judges Richard May (presiding) and Patrick Robinson.[^22] Milošević faced charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes committed in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo between 1991 and 1999.[^23] The case represented the first time a former head of state was prosecuted before an international criminal tribunal since the Nuremberg trials.

The Milošević trial was extraordinarily complex, involving thousands of pages of evidence, hundreds of witnesses, and novel legal questions about command responsibility and the criminal liability of heads of state.[^24] Milošević chose to represent himself, leading to frequent procedural challenges and delays. Judge Kwon's experience with both civil and common law systems proved valuable in navigating the hybrid procedural framework of the ICTY. However, the trial ended without a verdict when Milošević was found dead in his detention cell on March 11, 2006, just weeks before the conclusion of his defense case.[^25] The judges formally closed the trial on March 14, 2006.

### The Popović et al. Trial: Srebrenica Genocide

Following the Milošević case, Judge Kwon presided over the trial of Popović et al., one of the most significant cases concerning the Srebrenica genocide.[^26] The case involved seven high-ranking Bosnian Serb military and police officials accused of participating in the systematic murder of more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys following the fall of the Srebrenica enclave in July 1995.[^27] This trial addressed what has been called the worst atrocity on European soil since World War II.

The Popović case required meticulous examination of command structures, forensic evidence from mass graves, intercepted communications, and survivor testimony. Judge Kwon's handling of this complex case demonstrated his ability to manage large-scale war crimes prosecutions and his commitment to establishing a clear historical record of the genocide. The verdicts in this case contributed significantly to international criminal law jurisprudence on genocide and command responsibility.[^28]

### The Karadžić Trial and Sentencing

Judge Kwon's most prominent role at the ICTY came when he was appointed Presiding Judge in the trial of Radovan Karadžić, the former President of Republika Srpska and political leader of the Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian War.[^29] Karadžić faced charges of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, including responsibility for the Siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre.[^30] The trial began in October 2009 and continued for years, involving extensive evidence and witness testimony.

On March 24, 2016, Judge Kwon presided over the Trial Chamber that delivered its verdict, finding Karadžić guilty on 10 of 11 counts, including genocide for the Srebrenica massacre, persecution, extermination, murder, and other crimes against humanity.[^31] The chamber sentenced Karadžić to 40 years in prison. In his capacity as Presiding Judge, Kwon read portions of the lengthy judgment, which represented the culmination of years of meticulous legal work.[^32] The verdict was later appealed, and in 2019, the sentence was increased to life imprisonment by the appeals chamber.[^33]

### Vice-President of the ICTY

In recognition of his judicial excellence and leadership abilities, Judge Kwon was elected Vice-President of the ICTY in November 2008, a position to which he was re-elected in November 2009 for another two-year term, serving until 2011.[^34] As Vice-President, he worked alongside President Patrick Robinson to oversee the tribunal's operations during a critical period as it worked toward completing its mandate.[^35] His administrative responsibilities included managing judicial assignments, ensuring procedural efficiency, and representing the tribunal in diplomatic contexts.

Judge Kwon's 15-year tenure at the ICTY, from 2001 to 2016, concluded in March 2016, shortly after delivering the Karadžić verdict.[^36] His service at The Hague had established him as one of the leading international criminal law jurists of his generation, with direct involvement in some of the most significant war crimes prosecutions in modern history.

## President of the ICC Assembly of States Parties (2017-2021)

After retiring from the ICTY in March 2016, Judge Kwon joined the international law practice of Kim & Chang, South Korea's largest law firm, where he serves as President of the firm's International Law Institute.[^37] However, his return to private practice would be brief before the international community called upon him once again for leadership.

On December 4, 2017, at the 16th session of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute held in New York, O-Gon Kwon was elected President of the Assembly of States Parties (ASP) to the International Criminal Court for a three-year term.[^38] He officially assumed the position on December 14, 2017, becoming the sixth person to hold this post and only the second from the Asia-Pacific region.[^39] The ASP serves as the management oversight and legislative body of the ICC, composed of representatives from the 123 states that have ratified the Rome Statute.

As ASP President, Kwon faced significant challenges to the International Criminal Court's legitimacy and independence. His tenure coincided with increasing pressure on the ICC from various quarters, including the withdrawal of several African states and unprecedented measures taken by the United States government against ICC officials investigating alleged American war crimes in Afghanistan.[^40]

### Defending the Court's Independence

In June 2020, after the U.S. administration imposed sanctions on ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and authorized asset freezes and travel bans against ICC officials, President Kwon issued a forceful statement defending the court's independence. He declared: "The International Criminal Court is an independent and impartial judicial institution crucial for ensuring accountability for the gravest crimes under international law."[^41] He emphasized that "The Court's mandate is to help put an end to impunity for the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole and to bring justice to those affected by such crimes."[^42]

Kwon rejected the measures as unprecedented attacks on the multilateral rules-based order and the independence of the Court, stating unequivocally: "The Court is independent and impartial. The ICC is a court of law. It operates in strict adherence to the provisions of the Rome Statute."[^43] His defense of the ICC during this period demonstrated considerable diplomatic courage, as he publicly opposed actions by the world's most powerful nation while representing the collective will of the 123 states parties to the Rome Statute.

Throughout his presidency, Kwon repeatedly affirmed that "The ICC embodies our collective commitment to fight impunity for the most serious crimes of international concern," and called on all states to "respect the judicial and prosecutorial independence of the Court and work together towards ensuring our common aim of fighting impunity for the perpetrators of the gravest crimes under international law."[^44]

President Kwon's three-year term concluded in February 2021, after successfully navigating one of the most challenging periods in the ICC's history.[^45] His leadership helped maintain the Court's legitimacy and operational capacity during a time of unprecedented external pressure.

---

## Return to Korea and Continued Service

Following his tenure as ASP President, Kwon returned to his position at Kim & Chang, where he continues to practice international law and advise on cross-border litigation and international criminal justice matters.[^46] His expertise has been sought for several important positions within Korea related to international law and human rights.

In April 2017, while serving as ASP President, Kwon was appointed as Chairman of the Korean Ministry of Justice Legal Counsel Committee for Human Rights in North Korea.[^47] This committee was established to address human rights violations in North Korea and to develop legal strategies for accountability. His appointment reflected Korea's recognition of his international stature and his expertise in addressing grave human rights abuses through legal mechanisms.[^48]

From 2017 to 2022, Kwon served as President of the Korean Society of Law, the country's largest and most comprehensive legal association, encompassing all categories of jurists including judges, prosecutors, attorneys, and law professors.[^49] He was reappointed for a second term in January 2018, becoming the organization's 15th president.[^50] This position allowed him to shape legal education and professional development within Korea while promoting international legal cooperation.

Additionally, Korean media reported that Kwon was appointed as a board member of the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, though the exact dates of this service are not clearly documented in available sources.[^51] The Trust Fund provides support to victims of crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction and implements court-ordered reparations.

## Major Achievements and Contributions

O-Gon Kwon's contributions to international criminal justice and Korean law are substantial and multifaceted. His achievements span judicial excellence, institutional leadership, and the advancement of international legal norms.

### Judicial Accomplishments

Judge Kwon's most significant judicial achievement was presiding over the Radovan Karadžić trial and delivering the historic verdict that convicted the Bosnian Serb leader of genocide and crimes against humanity.[^52] This trial represented one of the most important prosecutions in the history of international criminal law, holding a former political leader accountable for mass atrocities including the murder of more than 7,000 people at Srebrenica. The judgment established important precedents regarding the criminal responsibility of political leaders for genocide and crimes against humanity committed by forces under their control.[^53]

His participation in the trials of Slobodan Milošević and the Srebrenica genocide perpetrators in the Popović case contributed to establishing a comprehensive historical and legal record of the Yugoslav Wars.[^54] These trials demonstrated that even the highest political and military officials could be held accountable for international crimes, reinforcing the principle that no one is above the law.

### Development of International Criminal Procedure

As one of the first judges at the ICTY, Kwon played a crucial role in developing the procedural law of international criminal tribunals. As he noted, the ICTY operated as a hybrid system incorporating both common law and civil law traditions, requiring judges to create new procedural frameworks without clear precedent.[^55] His decisions on matters of evidence, witness protection, victim participation, and fair trial rights helped establish standards that have influenced subsequent international and hybrid criminal tribunals, including the International Criminal Court, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia.

### Leadership in International Justice Institutions

Kwon's election as Vice-President of the ICTY (2008-2011) and later as President of the ICC Assembly of States Parties (2017-2021) demonstrated the international legal community's recognition of his leadership abilities and diplomatic skills.[^56] As ASP President, he successfully defended the ICC's independence during a period of unprecedented external pressure, maintaining support among states parties and ensuring the Court's continued operation.[^57]

### Bridging Asia and International Justice

As the first Korean judge at an international criminal tribunal, Kwon served as a bridge between Asia and the international criminal justice system.[^58] His presence at the ICTY and later leadership at the ICC helped demonstrate that international criminal justice was not solely a Western project but embodied universal values shared across cultures and legal traditions. His service encouraged greater Asian participation in international legal institutions and demonstrated Korea's commitment to the rule-of-law-based international order.

### Awards and Recognition

In recognition of his distinguished service, Judge Kwon received numerous awards and honors. In September 2008, he was awarded the "Moran" National Order of Merit (Moran Medal, Order of Civil Merit) from the President of South Korea.[^59] He received the Korean Legal Culture Award from the Korean Bar Association in 2013 and the Youngsan Legal Culture Award from the Youngsan Foundation of Law & Culture in 2011.[^60] In 2017, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Asialaw, recognizing his contributions to Asian legal practice and international law.[^61] He also received the Kyung-Ahm Special Prize in 2018 and was honored as Lawyer of the Year by the Legal Press Club in 2009.[^62]

## Controversies and Criticisms

While O-Gon Kwon is widely respected within the international legal community, his work has not been without controversy, primarily stemming from the inherently political nature of international criminal justice and debates about the fairness and effectiveness of international tribunals.

### Criticisms of the ICTY

The ICTY itself faced substantial criticism throughout its existence, including claims of victor's justice, bias against Serbian defendants, and failure to prosecute NATO officials for alleged war crimes during the 1999 Kosovo intervention.[^63] As a senior judge at the tribunal, including during his tenure as Vice-President, Kwon was associated with these institutional controversies even though specific criticisms of his individual judicial decisions are limited in the public record.

Serbian nationalist critics argued that the ICTY disproportionately targeted Serbs while treating crimes committed against Serbs with less seriousness.[^64] While Judge Kwon was not individually accused of bias, he presided over several major trials of Serbian defendants, including Milošević and Karadžić, which placed him at the center of these politically charged proceedings. The fact that the Milošević trial ended without a verdict after the defendant's death was seen by some as a failure of justice, though this outcome was beyond the judges' control.[^65]

### Length and Cost of Proceedings

The trials over which Judge Kwon presided were extraordinarily lengthy and expensive. The Karadžić trial alone lasted nearly seven years from indictment to initial verdict.[^66] Critics of international criminal tribunals have argued that such lengthy proceedings undermine their effectiveness and deterrent value. As Presiding Judge in the Karadžić case, Kwon faced the challenge of balancing the defendant's right to a fair trial, including the right to present a defense, with the need for expeditious justice. While he managed the proceedings competently, the trial's duration remains a point of criticism for those skeptical of international criminal justice mechanisms.

### ICC Legitimacy Debates

During Kwon's tenure as President of the Assembly of States Parties, the International Criminal Court faced significant legitimacy challenges. Several African states threatened to withdraw from the Rome Statute, claiming the ICC disproportionately targeted African leaders while ignoring crimes committed by powerful Western nations.[^67] While Kwon was not the Court itself but rather the president of its governing body, his leadership occurred during this crisis of confidence.

Additionally, some critics argued that Kwon's forceful defense of the ICC against American pressure, while principled, failed to address underlying concerns about the Court's selectivity and effectiveness.[^68] The ICC's inability to arrest many of its indictees and its limited impact on preventing atrocities continued to fuel skepticism about the international criminal justice project that Kwon championed.

### Limited Transparency on Personal Views

Unlike some international jurists who have written extensively about their judicial philosophy and experiences, Judge Kwon has maintained relative discretion about the details of his decision-making processes and his views on controversial aspects of international criminal law.[^69] This discretion, while professionally appropriate, has limited public understanding of his judicial reasoning and has prevented fuller academic engagement with his jurisprudence. Some legal scholars have noted that separate opinions he may have written could have contributed more robustly to the development of international criminal law doctrine.

### Questions About Post-Judicial Career

Some observers have questioned whether judges who serve at international criminal tribunals should immediately transition to private law practice, as Kwon did when he joined Kim & Chang in 2016.[^70] While there is no evidence of any ethical violation, and such transitions are common, questions persist about whether former international judges should observe a cooling-off period before engaging in private practice that may involve international law matters potentially related to their judicial experience.

---

## Personal Life

O-Gon Kwon has maintained a notably private personal life throughout his prominent public career. Unlike many high-profile jurists, he has kept details about his family relationships and personal interests largely out of the public sphere.[^71]

According to available biographical sources, Kwon is reported to be single with no children, though the accuracy and currency of this information is difficult to verify given the limited public discussion of his personal life.[^72] This privacy is consistent with Korean cultural norms regarding the separation between public professional roles and private family matters, particularly for senior members of the judiciary.

Throughout his 15 years at The Hague, Kwon lived in the Netherlands, becoming fluent in the operational languages of the ICTY while maintaining his Korean identity and connections to his home country.[^73] His ability to navigate multiple cultures—Korean, European, and the unique international legal culture of The Hague—speaks to considerable personal adaptability and intercultural competence.

Colleagues and interviewers have described Kwon as intellectually rigorous, diplomatic, and deeply committed to the rule of law.[^74] In interviews, he has demonstrated a thoughtful, measured speaking style and a tendency to focus on institutional questions rather than personal narratives. His public statements emphasize collective achievements of the tribunals and courts he served rather than individual accomplishments, reflecting both professional modesty and an institutional orientation.

Those who have worked with Judge Kwon describe him as a meticulous jurist who carefully studies case materials and approaches legal questions with both principled commitment to international law and practical awareness of the political contexts in which international courts operate.[^75] His ability to build consensus among fellow judges from diverse legal backgrounds has been noted as one of his key strengths.

In his rare public reflections on his career, Kwon has emphasized the importance of creating legal institutions that transcend national interests to serve universal principles of justice.[^76] This philosophical commitment to internationalism and the rule of law appears to be a defining feature of his professional identity and personal worldview.

## Legacy and Impact

O-Gon Kwon's legacy in international criminal justice is substantial and multifaceted, extending well beyond his individual judicial decisions to encompass his role in establishing and defending the institutions of international criminal law.

### Pioneering Asian Participation

As the first Korean and one of the first Asian judges to serve at a major UN international criminal tribunal, Kwon opened pathways for greater Asian participation in international legal institutions.[^77] His success demonstrated that jurists from Asia could make significant contributions to international criminal law, a field that had previously been dominated by European and North American legal traditions. His service helped legitimize international criminal justice as a truly global enterprise rather than a Western imposition.

Several Korean and Asian jurists have followed Kwon's path to international judicial positions, and his career is frequently cited as an example of Korea's contribution to the international rule-of-law order.[^78] His service has enhanced Korea's soft power and international reputation as a nation committed to human rights and international justice.

### Contribution to Genocide Jurisprudence

Judge Kwon's work on the Srebrenica genocide cases, particularly the Popović and Karadžić trials, contributed significantly to the development of genocide law.[^79] These cases established important precedents regarding what constitutes genocidal intent, the scope of command responsibility for genocide, and the types of evidence that can establish systematic campaigns of extermination. The Karadžić judgment, in particular, provided detailed analysis of the specific intent requirement for genocide and clarified the relationship between crimes against humanity and genocide when both arise from the same factual circumstances.[^80]

Legal scholars continue to cite the judgments in cases over which Kwon presided as authoritative interpretations of the Genocide Convention and as important contributions to preventing and punishing genocide.[^81]

### Defense of Judicial Independence

Kwon's forceful defense of the ICC's independence during his tenure as ASP President established an important precedent for resisting political pressure on international courts.[^82] His public statements rejecting American sanctions on ICC officials demonstrated that the states parties to the Rome Statute, acting collectively through the Assembly, would defend the Court's independence against even the most powerful opposition. This defense helped preserve the ICC's legitimacy and operational capacity during a critical period.

His leadership during this period is likely to be remembered as a defining moment in the ICC's institutional history, when the Court's supporters successfully resisted efforts to undermine its independence through sanctions and political pressure.[^83]

### Institutional Memory and Continuity

Having served at both the ICTY (an ad hoc tribunal created by the UN Security Council) and in leadership of the ICC (a permanent treaty-based court), Kwon embodies institutional memory and continuity in international criminal justice.[^84] His ability to apply lessons learned from the ICTY experience to challenges facing the ICC has helped the permanent court benefit from the successes and learn from the mistakes of earlier tribunals.

His reflections on the challenges of creating hybrid legal procedures and managing complex international trials have informed ongoing debates about how to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of international criminal proceedings.[^85]

### Inspiration for Future Generations

Within Korea and across Asia, O-Gon Kwon serves as an inspirational figure for law students and young jurists interested in international law and human rights.[^86] His career trajectory—from top graduate of Seoul National University Law School to presiding judge over historic genocide trials to president of the ICC Assembly—demonstrates the possibilities for Asian legal professionals to achieve positions of global influence.

Law schools in Korea frequently cite his career as an example of excellence in the legal profession, and his path has encouraged greater Korean participation in international legal institutions and human rights advocacy.[^87]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Judge Kwon emphasize his unwavering commitment to international justice and the rule of law throughout his career. Legal scholars have praised his judicial craftsmanship, noting that the judgments in cases where he served as presiding judge demonstrate careful analysis of complex evidence and thoughtful application of international legal principles.[^88]

David Tolbert, a former senior official at the ICTY, noted in an interview that judges like Kwon played an essential role in establishing the credibility of international criminal justice, stating: "The quality and dedication of the judges was fundamental to the Tribunal's success. They came from different legal traditions and had to create a functioning system of justice in real-time."[^89] While not speaking specifically about Kwon, this assessment captures the historical significance of the first generation of international criminal judges.

Kwon's Korean colleagues have emphasized his role in elevating Korea's profile in international legal institutions. Kim & Chang, the law firm where he currently practices, describes him as "a pioneer in international criminal law" whose service "brought great honor to Korea and demonstrated Korean commitment to international justice and human rights."[^90]

International law scholars have noted that the Karadžić judgment, delivered under Kwon's leadership as presiding judge, represents one of the most comprehensive judicial analyses of the Bosnian War and provides crucial documentation of the Srebrenica genocide.[^91] Beth Van Schaack, a Stanford law professor specializing in international criminal law, has written that judgments like Karadžić "provide not just individual accountability but also an authoritative historical record that becomes increasingly important as time passes and memories fade."[^92]

Diplomatic observers have praised Kwon's leadership during his tenure as ASP President, particularly his defense of the ICC against American pressure. European diplomats familiar with his work described his response to the U.S. sanctions as "principled and courageous," noting that he "stood firmly for the independence of international justice at a moment when that independence was seriously threatened."[^93]

### Negative Views and Critical Perspectives

Critics of international criminal tribunals have questioned the effectiveness and fairness of the institutions where Judge Kwon served, though specific criticisms directed personally at him are relatively limited. Serbian scholars and political figures have argued that the ICTY represented victor's justice and was biased against Serbian defendants.[^94] While these criticisms are institutional rather than personal, judges who presided over major Serbian defendant trials, including Kwon, are associated with these controversies.

Some legal scholars have questioned whether the enormous resources devoted to lengthy international criminal trials—including those over which Kwon presided—represent an effective use of international justice resources.[^95] Sarah Nouwen, a professor of international law at the European University Institute, has written critically about the "celebratory narrative" surrounding international criminal tribunals, arguing that their actual impact on preventing atrocities and providing meaningful justice to victims has been limited.[^96] From this critical perspective, even competent judges like Kwon are participants in a system with fundamental limitations.

Critics have also noted that Kwon, like many international judges, has not published extensively about his judicial philosophy or the challenges of international criminal adjudication.[^97] Some scholars argue that greater transparency about judicial reasoning and the internal deliberations of international courts would strengthen their legitimacy and contribute more robustly to the development of international law.

African scholars and diplomats critical of the ICC have argued that the Court disproportionately focuses on African situations while powerful nations escape accountability.[^98] While Kwon served as ASP President rather than as a judge at the ICC, his leadership of the Assembly occurred during this legitimacy crisis, and some critics argue he did not adequately address these concerns about selectivity.

Finally, some observers have suggested that the transition of international judges to private legal practice immediately after their judicial service, as Kwon did in joining Kim & Chang, raises questions about potential conflicts of interest and the commercialization of expertise gained in public service.[^99] While no specific ethical violations have been alleged against Kwon, this broader critique of the international law professional ecosystem includes career trajectories like his.
