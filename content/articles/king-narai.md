## Summary

King Narai the Great (1632-1688) was the 27th monarch of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and the fourth and last king of the Prasat Thong dynasty. He reigned from 1656 to 1688, a period considered the most prosperous of the Ayutthaya era, marked by unprecedented diplomatic engagement with European powers, particularly France, and the first golden age of Thai literature.[^1][^2] His reign saw extensive foreign relations with nations from the Middle East to Western Europe, though his openness to Western influence ultimately contributed to the 1688 revolution that ended both his life and Siam's engagement with the West for over a century.[^3][^4] Posthumously styled "the Great"—one of only seven Thai monarchs to receive this honor—Narai remains a complex figure whose legacy encompasses both brilliant diplomacy and tragic political miscalculation.[^5]

## Early Life and Background

Prince Narai was born on February 16, 1632, to King Prasat Thong and Princess Sirithida, who was herself a daughter of the former King Songtham.[^6][^7] His father, Prasat Thong, had violently usurped the throne from the ruling Ayutthaya dynasty in 1629, establishing his own dynasty amid palace intrigue and bloodshed.[^8] According to royal chronicles, Narai's birth was accompanied by an auspicious miracle: he briefly appeared to have four arms, prompting his father to name him after the Hindu god Vishnu (Narayana in Sanskrit), who is traditionally depicted with multiple limbs.[^9] This divine association would later reinforce concepts of sacred kingship during his reign.

Narai's early years unfolded within the competitive and dangerous environment of the Ayutthaya court, where royal heirs constantly navigated rivalries among siblings and extended kin.[^10] He had an elder half-brother, Prince Chai, a younger sister Princess Si Suphan (also known as Princess Ratcha Kanlayani), and an uncle, Prince Si Suthammaracha.[^11] The young prince's upbringing included traditional royal education in Buddhist scriptures, military arts, statecraft, and literature—training that would later manifest in his renowned poetic abilities and strategic acumen.

The palace atmosphere grew increasingly volatile as Narai matured. His uncle Si Suthammaracha's lust for Princess Ratcha Kanlayani precipitated a dramatic crisis when the uncle ordered soldiers to surround her residence.[^12] The princess managed to hide in a book chest and was smuggled to the Front Palace, where she reunited with her brother Narai. This incident would prove pivotal in Narai's eventual path to power, demonstrating both the palace's treacherous dynamics and the young prince's protective instincts toward his family.

---

## Rise to Power

King Narai's ascension to the throne in 1656 came after violent palace upheavals that claimed the lives of his elder brother and uncle.[^13] Following King Prasat Thong's death in 1656, his elder son Prince Chai succeeded him but reigned only briefly before being overthrown by his uncle, Si Suthammaracha, the same figure who had previously threatened Princess Ratcha Kanlayani.[^14] Si Suthammaracha's usurpation proved equally short-lived, as widespread dissatisfaction with his rule created an opportunity for the 24-year-old Prince Narai to make his move.

With crucial military and political support, including backing from the Dutch East India Company, Narai mounted a successful coup against his uncle.[^15] On the Day of Ashura, Persians, Japanese, and Dutch forces stormed the palace to help him secure the throne, demonstrating the international character of Ayutthaya politics even at this early stage.[^16] In October 1656, at age 25, Narai occupied the throne of the Ayutthaya Empire, becoming the fourth monarch of the Prasat Thong dynasty.[^17]

The new king faced immediate challenges in consolidating power and establishing legitimacy after the succession crisis. Unlike his father who had seized power as a commoner, Narai could claim royal lineage through his mother's connection to King Songtham, strengthening his position.[^18] He moved quickly to neutralize potential threats, secure the loyalty of the nobility and Buddhist clergy, and establish his authority over the kingdom's provinces and vassal states.

Narai's early reign demonstrated both military prowess and diplomatic skill. He successfully defended against external threats while beginning the ambitious foreign policy initiatives that would define his rule. His ability to balance competing foreign interests—particularly among the Dutch, who had helped him gain power, and other European and Asian trading partners—showed a sophisticated understanding of international politics that would characterize his entire reign.[^19]

## Major Achievements

### Military Campaigns and Territorial Expansion

King Narai's military achievements established him as one of Ayutthaya's most formidable warrior-kings. Sensing weakness in Burmese influence over northern vassal states, in 1662 Narai launched the Burmese-Siamese War (1662-64) to bring Chiang Mai under direct Ayutthayan control.[^20] He successfully captured Martaban in March 1662, though Burmese forces recaptured it along with Tavoy by December of that year.[^21]

After stopping a Burmese army incursion at Sai Yok in 1663, Narai personally led a massive invasion force.[^22] According to Siamese sources, his army of 60,000 men captured Martaban, Syriam, Rangoon, and Hongsawadi, eventually laying siege to Pagan in 1664.[^23] In the north, his forces successfully took control of Lampang and other smaller cities, with a second expedition capturing Chiang Mai on February 10, 1663.[^24] While Burmese sources dispute the extent of Siamese victories, the campaign demonstrated Narai's military capabilities and secured a ninety-five-year peace with Burma lasting until 1759.[^25]

Narai's reign also saw the destruction of the Sultanate of Singgora (1605-1680) and successful military actions against various regional rivals.[^26] These victories expanded Ayutthaya's influence and secured important trade routes and ports.

### Literary and Cultural Golden Age

King Narai's most enduring legacy may be his fostering of the first golden age of Thai literature.[^27] The king himself was an accomplished poet who developed new verse forms and personally composed literary works.[^28] He wrote the final version of "Pra Lo" ("Lord Lo"), a tragic romance that had first been composed anonymously in an earlier reign.[^29] Narai also collaborated with court writers to create the first versions of the plays "Rama" and "Inao," based on Hindu-Khmer-Javanese models.[^30]

Under Narai's patronage, the royal court became a vibrant center for literary production. Distinguished court poets flourished, including Maharajaguru; Si Prat, who wrote the romantic poem "Aniruddha" and passionate love songs; Khun Devakavi, author of elaborate cradle-songs; and Si Mahosot, who composed an ode-epic praising King Narai.[^31] The travel poem (nirat) genre achieved new heights during this period, with Si Prat's famous "Nirat khlong kamsuan" ("A Mournful Journey") describing his exile to Nakhon Sri Thammarat.[^32]

The "Eulogy of King Narai," a major royal panegyric poem composed during his reign, relates key events and celebrates his power, reflecting the sophisticated literary culture he cultivated.[^33]

### Diplomatic Revolution and Trade Expansion

Anxious to break Dutch East India Company domination over Siam's external trade, Narai pursued an ambitious strategy of diversifying international partnerships.[^34] His officers—including Chinese, Persians, and Englishmen—developed extensive trade networks with Japan and India, while Narai actively courted the British East India Company and French trading interests.[^35]

Thai diplomatic missions traveled to King Louis XIV of France in 1680, 1684, and 1686, while France sent increasingly elaborate delegations to Siam in 1682, 1685, and 1687—the last including 600 soldiers in six warships.[^36][^37] In 1673, a French ecclesiastical mission arrived with letters from Pope Clement IX and King Louis XIV.[^38] The high-profile 1686 Siamese embassy to Versailles, headed by Kosa Pan, reached the French court on September 1, creating a sensation in Europe.[^39]

These diplomatic exchanges allowed Western observers to document Ayutthayan court life in unprecedented detail, providing invaluable historical records after most original Ayutthaya documents were destroyed when the city fell in 1767.[^40]

### Architectural and Administrative Innovations

Concerned that Ayutthaya's proximity to the sea made it vulnerable to naval attack by the Dutch and other powers, Narai developed Lopburi as a second capital.[^41] In 1666, he constructed an impressive palace complex designed by French architects in a distinctive blend of Thai and European architectural styles.[^42][^43] The palace featured European proportions, Gothic arches, and sophisticated hydraulic systems designed by French and European engineers hired by the king.[^44]

The seventeen-acre palace grounds, enclosed by plaster-covered brick walls featuring thousands of lotus-shaped niches for oil lamps, exemplified the cultural fusion Narai promoted.[^45] The Suttha Sawan Throne Hall, built in European style, served as his private residence, while other structures maintained traditional Thai architectural elements.[^46]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Constantine Phaulkon Problem

King Narai's greatest controversy centered on his relationship with Constantine Phaulkon, a Greek adventurer who rose to become the king's chief minister and de facto chancellor of state.[^47][^48] Thanks to Phaulkon's competence, administrative capabilities, and knowledge of Europe, Narai granted him extraordinary power that bred intense resentment among native mandarins and Buddhist clergy.[^49][^50] Siamese courtiers viewed Phaulkon as the focus of xenophobic sentiments, with the future usurper Phetracha leading the opposition.[^51]

The dominance of French officials in positions of authority, facilitated by Phaulkon's influence, created severe friction between foreign advisors and traditional court elites.[^52] This cultural and political tension ultimately led to the violent revolution of 1688 that would destroy both men and reverse Narai's entire foreign policy orientation.[^53]

### Excessive Foreign Influence and Loss of Sovereignty

Critics charged that Narai allowed dangerous levels of foreign interference in domestic affairs. Though the king expected the French to be satisfied with the cession of distant Songkhla, he was forced to accept their occupation of Bangkok, a major concession that alarmed xenophobic elements at court.[^54] In December 1685, a treaty drafted under Phaulkon's guidance granted France numerous trading privileges and allowed French troops to be stationed in Songkhla (then called Singora), effectively ceding military control of strategic territory.[^55]

The commercial interests of the French court were combined with aggressive religious intentions to convert the traditionally Buddhist king to Catholicism, creating additional friction.[^56] Anti-French and anti-Phaulkon sentiment ran high as many Siamese perceived these developments as threats to national sovereignty and religious integrity.[^57]

### English Trade Conflicts

Narai's reign witnessed significant conflict with the English East India Company, culminating in the Anglo-Siamese War (1687-88).[^58] The immediate cause involved disputes over Siamese actions at Mergui, which the English considered piracy, and English naval responses including blockades.[^59] Samuel White, the English governor of Mergui fort appointed by Narai and closely associated with Phaulkon, entered into conflict with English fleets from India in 1687, further complicating relations.[^60]

### Internal Governance Criticisms

Some contemporaries complained that Narai spent excessive time in Lopburi rather than the traditional capital, suggesting dereliction of administrative duties.[^61] Court chronicles also hint at concerns about his performance of royal rituals, particularly rainmaking ceremonies essential to the king's sacred role as guarantor of agricultural prosperity.[^62]

### The Abortion Policy

Perhaps Narai's darkest legacy was his reported policy regarding succession. Fearing the rise of a rival son, the king allegedly ordered abortions performed on any impregnated consorts, a brutal practice that reflected deep paranoia about palace coups.[^63] This policy resulted in only one surviving child, his daughter Princess Kromluang Yothathep, leaving the succession dangerously uncertain.[^64]

---

## Personal Life

### Family Relationships

King Narai maintained close bonds with his immediate family, particularly his sister Princess Ratcha Kanlayani (also known as Princess Si Suphan), whose rescue from their uncle's predatory advances had strengthened their relationship.[^65] His mother, Princess Sirithida, daughter of the revered King Songtham, provided him with crucial legitimacy through her royal lineage.[^66]

Narai's relationship with his adopted son, Phra Pi (Mom Pi), whom he named as potential successor, demonstrated his attempt to address the succession crisis created by his lack of male heirs.[^67] However, this adoption proved insufficient protection for the young man, who would be killed during the 1688 coup.[^68]

### Wives and Consorts

Historical records indicate that King Narai maintained multiple concubines, as was customary for Ayutthayan monarchs, though specific details about his wives remain limited.[^69] Phra Kasattri is listed among his spouses.[^70] The king's relationship with his consorts was complicated by his reported fear of producing a male heir who might threaten his position, allegedly leading to his controversial abortion policy.[^71]

Despite—or perhaps because of—this policy, Narai had one beloved daughter, Princess Kromluang Yothathep, whom he considered his only and most cherished child.[^72] When illness struck him in 1688, he nominated her to succeed him with his trusted councilors serving as regents until she married one of the Siamese nobles.[^73]

### Personal Characteristics and Beliefs

King Narai demonstrated remarkable intellectual breadth and cultural sophistication. As an accomplished poet and patron of literature, he actively participated in court literary activities rather than merely sponsoring them.[^74] His willingness to engage with foreign ideas while maintaining Buddhist identity revealed a cosmopolitan worldview rare among Asian monarchs of his era.

The king's religious tolerance became legendary. When French ambassador Alexandre de Chaumont pressed him to convert to Catholicism, Narai famously responded that he was surprised the King of France was so interested in religious matters when "God himself takes no interest" and leaves it to human discretion, suggesting that "the true God takes as much pleasure in being honoured by different cults and ceremonies as being glorified by a prodigious number of creatures that praise him each in their own way."[^75] He also told the ambassador: "I am extremely vexed that the King of France, my good friend, is proposing something so difficult," referring to changing "a Religion received and followed throughout my whole Kingdom without break for 2,229 years."[^76]

To Constantine Phaulkon, Narai reportedly said: "You are Christian; if you adopted my religion I would think you a scoundrel," demonstrating respect for genuine religious conviction.[^77]

## Legacy

### Immediate Aftermath and Policy Reversal

King Narai's death on July 10-11, 1688, possibly hastened by poisoning while in detention, marked a catastrophic turning point for Siam's international engagement.[^78] Phetracha, who had orchestrated the coup, proclaimed himself king and immediately pursued policies of expelling French influence and military forces from Siam.[^79] As a consequence of the 1688 revolution, Siam severed significant ties with the Western world, maintaining relations only with the Dutch East India Company until the 19th century.[^80]

All of Narai's diplomatic achievements were systematically reversed by his successor.[^81] The French were expelled, Western advisors dismissed or executed, and Siam entered a period of relative isolation from European powers. This dramatic reversal raises profound questions about whether Narai's openness to foreign influence represented visionary internationalism or dangerous naivety.

### The Colonization Question

Historians continue debating whether the curtailing of foreign influences after Narai prevented Siam's colonization or contributed to Ayutthaya's eventual fall in 1767.[^82] Some scholars argue that Narai's engagement with Western powers was becoming so extensive that Siam risked becoming a French protectorate or colony, making Phetracha's xenophobic reaction a necessary corrective. Others contend that the new introspective attitude of Narai's successors weakened Ayutthaya by cutting it off from technological and military innovations, contributing to its vulnerability to Burmese conquest.[^83]

What remains clear is that Narai's reign represented the greatest extent of foreign influence at the Siamese court before the 19th century.[^84]

### Historical Documentation

An unexpected aspect of Narai's legacy comes from the detailed records kept by Western diplomats, missionaries, and visitors to his court. Because most original Ayutthaya records were destroyed when the city fell to the Burmese in 1767, these European accounts—including those by French Jesuits, embassy officials like Simon de la Loubère, and others—provide invaluable glimpses into Ayutthayan court life, administration, and culture that would otherwise be lost.[^85][^86]

### Cultural and Literary Impact

The golden age of literature that flourished under Narai's patronage established traditions and verse forms that influenced Thai poetry for centuries.[^87] His own literary works and those of his court poets created a canon that later generations studied and emulated. The cultural sophistication of his reign became a touchstone for Thai artistic achievement.

### Modern Recognition and Commemoration

King Narai's significance is reflected in his posthumous title "the Great," one of only seven Thai monarchs so honored.[^88] Modern Thailand celebrates his memory through the annual King Narai Festival in Lopburi, a ten-day event featuring majestic processions, traditional performances, and a historical marketplace set against the backdrop of his palace.[^89] These celebrations revive his era's rich cultural heritage and demonstrate continued veneration in contemporary Thailand.

His palace in Lopburi, now the Somdet Phra Narai National Museum, preserves artifacts from his reign and serves as a major cultural heritage site.[^90] The palace grounds showcase the architectural fusion of Thai and European styles that characterized his cosmopolitan vision.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders of King Narai emphasize his diplomatic genius and cultural achievements. Modern historians recognize him as arguably the most famous king of the Prasat Thong dynasty, whose reign marked the Ayutthaya Kingdom's most prosperous period.[^91] His court produced the first golden age of Thai literature, with Narai himself celebrated as a great poet who developed new verse forms that enriched Thai literary tradition.[^92]

Supporters highlight his successful military campaigns, particularly the 1662-64 Burma war that secured ninety-five years of peace with Siam's most dangerous rival.[^93] His defensive victory against Burmese invasion in 1664 and subsequent counter-offensive demonstrated both strategic acumen and personal courage in leading armies of 60,000 men.[^94]

Narai's religious tolerance and intellectual sophistication earn particular praise from modern scholars. His famous defense of religious pluralism against French conversion attempts—arguing that "the true God takes as much pleasure in being honoured by different cults and ceremonies as being glorified by a prodigious number of creatures that praise him each in their own way"—reveals an Enlightenment sensibility ahead of his time.[^95] A contemporary mega-hit television serial paying tribute to his "diplomatic genius" reflects continued popular admiration.[^96]

Historians note that his engagement with Western powers, while ultimately reversed, demonstrated remarkable vision in attempting to balance European trading interests and break Dutch commercial dominance.[^97] His hiring of diverse international advisors—Chinese, Persians, Englishmen, and French—created a cosmopolitan court culture unique in Southeast Asian history.[^98]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that Narai's foreign policy was fundamentally flawed, granting dangerous levels of power to foreigners like Constantine Phaulkon and making excessive concessions to French interests.[^99] The forced acceptance of French occupation of Bangkok, when Narai had expected them to be satisfied with distant Songkhla, demonstrated poor diplomatic judgment and failure to understand European imperial ambitions.[^100]

Some historians view his literary and cultural achievements as coming at the cost of political stability. The complaint that he spent too much time in Lopburi rather than the traditional capital suggests misplaced priorities during a critical period.[^101] His reported failure to properly perform royal rainmaking rituals indicates neglect of sacred duties essential to maintaining legitimacy in traditional Thai kingship.[^102]

The most damning criticism concerns Narai's judgment in elevating Phaulkon to such extraordinary power that he "technically became the chancellor of the state."[^103] This decision provoked the xenophobic reaction that destroyed him and led directly to the 1688 revolution. Critics argue that a more politically astute monarch would have recognized the growing anti-foreign sentiment and moderated his policies before they became explosive.

Narai's abortion policy regarding potential male heirs reveals a paranoid and cruel dimension to his character, creating the succession crisis that made the palace vulnerable to Phetracha's coup.[^104] By eliminating potential heirs and leaving only his daughter and adopted son, he ensured violent instability upon his death.

The ultimate failure of all his diplomatic initiatives—with his successor reversing every policy and expelling foreign influences—suggests that Narai fundamentally misjudged the limits of acceptable foreign engagement in traditional Siamese society.[^105] Whether this represents visionary leadership ahead of its time or dangerous political incompetence remains contested among historians.
