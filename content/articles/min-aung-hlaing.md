## Summary

Min Aung Hlaing is a Myanmar military officer who has served as the Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services (Tatmadaw) since 2011 and Chairman of the State Administration Council since the February 2021 military coup that overthrew the democratically elected government led by Aung San Suu Kyi. Born on July 3, 1956, in Tavoy (now Dawei), Myanmar, he rose through the military ranks during decades of authoritarian rule. His leadership has been marked by allegations of human rights violations, including the 2017 Rohingya genocide, and the violent suppression of pro-democracy protests following the 2021 coup. He remains one of the most controversial and internationally sanctioned figures in contemporary Myanmar politics.

## Early Life and Background

Min Aung Hlaing was born on July 3, 1956, in Tavoy (Dawei), Tenasserim Division, in southern Myanmar, during a period when the country was under the governance of Prime Minister U Nu.[^1] His father was a civil servant who worked in the customs department, providing the family with a modest middle-class background.[^2] Growing up in the post-independence era of Burma, Min Aung Hlaing witnessed the country's transition from parliamentary democracy to military rule following General Ne Win's coup in 1962.

He attended the local State High School in Dawei before moving to Yangon (then Rangoon) for his higher education.[^3] In his youth, Min Aung Hlaing showed an interest in military affairs, influenced by the dominant role the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) played in national politics and society. His decision to pursue a military career was shaped by the prevailing cultural narrative that portrayed the military as the guardian of national unity and sovereignty.[^4]

In 1974, at the age of 18, Min Aung Hlaing enrolled at the Defence Services Academy (DSA) in Pyin Oo Lwin, the premier institution for officer training in Myanmar.[^5] He graduated in 1977 as part of the 19th intake, joining the armed forces at a time when the country was under the authoritarian rule of the Burma Socialist Programme Party. His early military education instilled in him the institutional values of the Tatmadaw, including its self-perception as the ultimate authority in national affairs, superseding civilian governance.[^6]

During his formative years, Myanmar was isolated from the international community, economically struggling under Ne Win's "Burmese Way to Socialism," and facing multiple ethnic insurgencies across its border regions.[^7] These conditions shaped Min Aung Hlaing's worldview, emphasizing national security, military supremacy, and suspicion of foreign interference—themes that would later define his political career.[^8]

---

## Rise to Power

After graduating from the Defence Services Academy, Min Aung Hlaing was commissioned as a second lieutenant and assigned to the Triangle Region Military Command in northern Shan State, one of Myanmar's most conflict-prone areas.[^9] His early postings involved counter-insurgency operations against various ethnic armed organizations, including the Communist Party of Burma and Shan State Army, where he gained field experience and built a reputation for tactical competence.[^10]

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Min Aung Hlaing steadily climbed the military hierarchy, serving in various command and staff positions. He attended the Command and General Staff Course and later the National Defence College, both critical stepping stones for senior military leadership.[^11] His career advancement accelerated after 1988, when the military violently suppressed nationwide pro-democracy protests and established the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), later renamed the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC).[^12]

During this period, Min Aung Hlaing served in key operational roles, including commander of the Southwest Command and the Bureau of Special Operations-2, which oversaw military operations in eastern Myanmar.[^13] His loyalty to senior military leaders, particularly Senior General Than Shwe, and his effectiveness in managing counter-insurgency campaigns positioned him as a rising star within the Tatmadaw.[^14]

In 2009, Min Aung Hlaing was promoted to Lieutenant General and appointed Joint Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, making him the third most powerful figure in the military hierarchy.[^15] This appointment came at a critical juncture, as Myanmar was transitioning from direct military rule to a quasi-civilian government under the 2008 Constitution, which nevertheless guaranteed the military's dominant role in politics.[^16]

On March 30, 2011, Min Aung Hlaing was appointed Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services, succeeding Senior General Than Shwe.[^17] This promotion coincided with the official dissolution of the military junta and the inauguration of President Thein Sein's government, which initiated a period of limited political and economic reforms. However, Min Aung Hlaing ensured that the Tatmadaw retained significant autonomy, controlling the ministries of Defence, Home Affairs, and Border Affairs, as well as 25% of parliamentary seats.[^18]

During the reform era (2011-2015), Min Aung Hlaing maintained a complex relationship with the civilian government. While he publicly supported some reforms, he resisted efforts to reduce military influence and actively opposed constitutional amendments that would diminish the Tatmadaw's political role.[^19] His power was further consolidated through extensive business interests controlled by military conglomerates such as the Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (UMEHL).[^20]

## Major Achievements

From a military institutional perspective, Min Aung Hlaing is credited with modernizing certain aspects of Myanmar's armed forces during his tenure as Commander-in-Chief. He oversaw efforts to upgrade military equipment, including the acquisition of Russian fighter jets, armored vehicles, and naval vessels, aimed at enhancing the Tatmadaw's conventional warfare capabilities.[^21] He also emphasized military professionalism and training, expanding educational programs at the Defence Services Academy and other military institutions.[^22]

Min Aung Hlaing initiated infrastructure development projects in military cantonments and border regions, constructing roads, bridges, and communication networks that served both military and civilian purposes.[^23] These projects were presented as contributions to national development, although critics noted they also facilitated military control over ethnic minority areas.[^24]

Under his leadership, the Tatmadaw negotiated ceasefire agreements with several ethnic armed organizations, including the Karen National Union (KNU) and the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS).[^25] In 2015, the government signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) with eight ethnic armed groups, which Min Aung Hlaing promoted as a significant step toward national reconciliation, although many major insurgent groups refused to sign.[^26]

Min Aung Hlaing also cultivated international military relationships, particularly with Russia, China, India, and Thailand, conducting joint exercises and securing defense cooperation agreements.[^27] These partnerships provided Myanmar's military with diplomatic support and access to military technology, reducing its international isolation.[^28]

Within the domestic political context, Min Aung Hlaing positioned himself as a guardian of national sovereignty and Buddhist identity. He promoted Buddhist nationalism and aligned the Tatmadaw with conservative religious groups, portraying the military as a protector of the country's cultural and religious heritage against perceived threats from ethnic minorities and foreign influence.[^29]

Following the National League for Democracy's (NLD) landslide victory in the 2015 elections, Min Aung Hlaing maintained the military's institutional prerogatives under the 2008 Constitution. Despite civilian governance, he ensured the Tatmadaw's continued control over security affairs and prevented constitutional reforms that would have reduced military power.[^30] His ability to preserve military autonomy during this period demonstrated his political acumen and institutional influence.[^31]

In the military's narrative, the February 1, 2021 coup was presented as a necessary intervention to address alleged electoral fraud in the November 2020 elections, which the NLD won overwhelmingly.[^32] Min Aung Hlaing declared a state of emergency, detained civilian leaders including Aung San Suu Kyi, and established the State Administration Council (SAC) with himself as chairman.[^33] The military justified this action as protecting democracy and constitutional order, though these claims were widely rejected by the international community and domestic opposition.[^34]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Min Aung Hlaing's tenure has been dominated by severe human rights violations and international condemnation. The most serious allegations concern the 2017 military operations in Rakhine State against the Rohingya Muslim minority. Following attacks by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) on military posts in August 2017, the Tatmadaw launched what it termed "clearance operations," which resulted in mass killings, sexual violence, and the burning of hundreds of Rohingya villages.[^35]

Over 700,000 Rohingya fled to neighboring Bangladesh, and international investigators documented systematic atrocities that amounted to crimes against humanity and genocide.[^36] The United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar concluded in 2018 that Min Aung Hlaing and other senior military leaders should be investigated and prosecuted for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.[^37] The International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar to take measures to prevent genocide in 2020, and the International Criminal Court authorized an investigation into deportation and persecution of the Rohingya.[^38]

Min Aung Hlaing consistently denied these allegations, claiming the military operations were legitimate counter-terrorism responses and that reports of atrocities were fabricated by international actors seeking to destabilize Myanmar.[^39] He refused to cooperate with international investigations and prevented independent observers from accessing conflict areas.[^40]

The February 2021 coup triggered widespread domestic resistance, with millions participating in the Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) and mass protests demanding the restoration of democracy.[^41] The military responded with brutal force, killing over 1,500 civilians and arresting more than 12,000 people within the first year, according to human rights organizations.[^42] Security forces used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, conducted nighttime raids, and employed torture in detention facilities.[^43]

Min Aung Hlaing's regime also faced armed resistance from newly formed People's Defence Forces (PDF) and ethnic armed organizations that rejected military rule.[^44] The military conducted indiscriminate airstrikes and artillery attacks on civilian areas, burned villages, and committed summary executions, documented by international human rights monitors.[^45]

Economically, the coup reversed years of development progress. International sanctions targeted military-linked businesses, foreign investment plummeted, and the banking system faced severe disruptions.[^46] The World Bank estimated Myanmar's economy contracted by 18% in 2021, pushing millions into poverty.[^47] Min Aung Hlaing's government struggled to maintain basic services, including healthcare and education, as civil servants joined the CDM and refused to work under military rule.[^48]

His regime has been accused of severe censorship and media suppression, revoking broadcasting licenses, arresting journalists, and blocking internet access.[^49] Independent media outlets were forced to cease operations or operate underground, while state media disseminated propaganda supporting the military's narrative.[^50]

Internationally, Min Aung Hlaing became one of the world's most isolated leaders. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom, and Canada imposed targeted sanctions on him personally, freezing assets and banning travel.[^51] ASEAN, traditionally reluctant to interfere in member states' internal affairs, took the unprecedented step of excluding Min Aung Hlaing from regional summits and appointing a special envoy to Myanmar, though with limited results.[^52]

Critics also highlighted the regime's failure to address the COVID-19 pandemic, with healthcare services collapsing amid the political crisis and deliberate military obstruction of humanitarian assistance.[^53] The education system deteriorated as teachers and students boycotted schools, and the military arrested educators participating in resistance movements.[^54]

## Personal Life

Min Aung Hlaing is married to Kyu Kyu Hla, daughter of a former military officer, and the couple has two daughters and one son.[^55] His family has attracted scrutiny for their lavish lifestyle and business connections. His daughter, Khin Thiri Thet Mon, married Thant Zin Oo, whose father was a prominent general, creating an influential military family network.[^56] She has been involved in charity organizations aligned with the military and has faced sanctions from Western governments for her connections to military enterprises.[^57]

His son, Aung Pyae Sone, has business interests in various sectors including gemstones, tourism, and logistics, often through partnerships with military-controlled companies.[^58] These business connections have led to allegations of corruption and nepotism, with critics arguing that the Min Aung Hlaing family has enriched itself through military connections and access to state resources.[^59]

Min Aung Hlaing is known for his interest in golf and has been photographed at military golf courses, a privilege reserved for senior officers.[^60] He is also a devout Buddhist and regularly participates in religious ceremonies, donating to monasteries and pagodas, which he uses to cultivate support among conservative Buddhist constituencies.[^61]

Associates describe him as disciplined, reserved, and intensely loyal to the institutional interests of the Tatmadaw.[^62] Unlike some previous military leaders who exhibited charismatic personalities, Min Aung Hlaing is characterized as methodical and bureaucratic, focused on maintaining military cohesion and supremacy.[^63]

He maintains a presence on social media, particularly Facebook, where his official page posts statements, photos of military activities, and nationalist messages.[^64] However, following the 2021 coup, Facebook banned his accounts for inciting violence and spreading misinformation.[^65]

His lifestyle has been criticized as opulent compared to ordinary Myanmar citizens, with leaked documents revealing ownership of luxury properties and expensive watches.[^66] These revelations contradicted the military's professed commitment to national service and fueled public resentment.[^67]

## Legacy

Min Aung Hlaing's legacy is predominantly defined by authoritarianism, human rights abuses, and the destruction of Myanmar's democratic transition. His role in the Rohingya genocide has ensured his place among the most condemned military leaders of the 21st century, with ongoing international legal proceedings seeking accountability.[^68]

The 2021 coup will likely be remembered as a catastrophic setback for Myanmar's development, plunging the country into civil conflict, economic collapse, and international isolation.[^69] His decision to overthrow the elected government reversed decades of gradual progress toward democratic governance and alienated an entire generation of Myanmar citizens who had experienced limited freedoms during the reform period.[^70]

Within Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing is viewed by the pro-democracy movement as a dictator responsible for mass suffering and the destruction of national aspirations for freedom and prosperity.[^71] The resistance against his regime has united diverse ethnic and political groups in unprecedented ways, potentially reshaping Myanmar's political landscape for decades.[^72]

For the Tatmadaw institution, his leadership represents both the preservation of military dominance and a strategic miscalculation. While he successfully maintained military autonomy and economic interests in the short term, the coup generated sustained armed resistance, fractured military legitimacy, and damaged relationships with neighboring countries and international partners.[^73]

Some military supporters view Min Aung Hlaing as a defender of national sovereignty against foreign interference and a protector of Buddhist identity.[^74] However, this perspective is largely confined to military circles and nationalist groups, with limited support among the broader population.[^75]

The economic legacy of his rule includes the collapse of foreign investment, destruction of infrastructure in conflict zones, and the reversal of poverty reduction gains.[^76] Myanmar's international reputation suffered irreparable damage, transforming from an emerging market with potential into a pariah state associated with atrocities and instability.[^77]

Historically, Min Aung Hlaing may be remembered as the military leader who ended Myanmar's brief experiment with democratic transition, cementing the Tatmadaw's reputation as an obstacle to national progress rather than its guardian.[^78] His inability to consolidate political control despite overwhelming military force demonstrated the limits of authoritarian power in the face of sustained popular resistance.[^79]

The humanitarian crisis he precipitated, including millions of internally displaced persons and the continuation of the Rohingya refugee crisis, will affect regional stability for generations.[^80] His legacy also includes the radicalization of Myanmar's youth, many of whom took up arms against the military, fundamentally altering the country's social fabric.[^81]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Within military circles and among some nationalist constituencies in Myanmar, Min Aung Hlaing is portrayed as a patriotic leader who defended national sovereignty and prevented foreign interference in domestic affairs.[^82] Supporters argue that the Tatmadaw, under his leadership, maintained Myanmar's territorial integrity against ethnic insurgencies and protected the country from becoming a proxy in great power competition.[^83]

Some military analysts credit him with modernizing aspects of Myanmar's armed forces, improving training standards, and expanding military infrastructure, which from a purely institutional perspective represents organizational development.[^84] Military-aligned scholars emphasize his role in negotiating ceasefire agreements with various ethnic armed organizations as evidence of commitment to national reconciliation, despite the limited success of these initiatives.[^85]

Buddhist nationalist groups that support the military view Min Aung Hlaing as a defender of Buddhism against perceived threats from Muslim minorities and Western secular influences.[^86] These groups appreciate his public displays of Buddhist piety and donations to religious institutions, interpreting them as genuine commitment to preserving Myanmar's cultural identity.[^87]

From a realist international relations perspective, some analysts acknowledge that Min Aung Hlaing successfully maintained strategic relationships with major powers including China, Russia, and India, providing Myanmar with diplomatic options despite Western pressure.[^88] His ability to balance these relationships while preserving military autonomy demonstrated strategic acumen in a complex geopolitical environment.[^89]

State media and military-controlled publications portray him as a decisive leader who took necessary action to prevent national disintegration, framing the 2021 coup as a constitutional duty rather than an illegal seizure of power.[^90] This narrative emphasizes alleged electoral fraud and presents military intervention as protecting democratic institutions, though this interpretation is rejected by independent observers.[^91]

### Negative Views

International human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and Fortify Rights, have documented extensive evidence of crimes against humanity committed under Min Aung Hlaing's command, including the Rohingya genocide and post-coup atrocities.[^92] These organizations characterize him as a perpetrator of systematic violence against civilians and call for his prosecution at the International Criminal Court.[^93]

The UN Special Rapporteur on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, described Min Aung Hlaing's regime as a "terrorist organization" conducting widespread attacks on civilians and committing war crimes.[^94] UN investigators concluded that his leadership bears primary responsibility for genocidal acts against the Rohingya and crimes against humanity against pro-democracy protesters.[^95]

Academic scholars specializing in Myanmar studies largely condemn Min Aung Hlaing as an authoritarian leader who destroyed Myanmar's democratic transition for personal and institutional power.[^96] Comparative studies of military coups characterize the 2021 seizure of power as particularly egregious given Myanmar's recent experience with limited democratic freedoms.[^97]

Political scientists note that his strategic miscalculation in launching the coup underestimated popular resistance and overestimated the military's ability to govern, resulting in prolonged civil conflict and state fragmentation.[^98] His failure to consolidate political legitimacy despite overwhelming military force demonstrates fundamental weaknesses in his leadership and understanding of contemporary political dynamics.[^99]

Myanmar civil society organizations, including the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) and the Women's League of Burma, document his regime's systematic use of torture, sexual violence, and arbitrary detention as tools of repression.[^100] These organizations characterize his rule as a return to the darkest periods of military dictatorship.[^101]

International legal experts emphasize that Min Aung Hlaing's refusal to cooperate with international justice mechanisms and his obstruction of humanitarian access constitute additional violations of international law.[^102] His regime's attacks on healthcare facilities and workers during the COVID-19 pandemic are documented as deliberate attempts to punish civilian populations.[^103]

Regional analysts argue that Min Aung Hlaing's leadership has destabilized Southeast Asia, creating refugee flows, drug trafficking routes, and security challenges for neighboring countries.[^104] ASEAN diplomats privately express frustration with his intransigence and failure to implement the Five-Point Consensus agreed upon in 2021.[^105]
