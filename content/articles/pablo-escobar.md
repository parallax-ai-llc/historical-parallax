## Summary
Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug lord who founded the Medellín Cartel. At the height of his power, he supplied 80% of the cocaine smuggled into the United States. He amassed a fortune estimated at $30 billion. He was killed in a shootout with Colombian security forces in 1993.

## Early Life
Born December 1, 1949, in Rionegro, Antioquia, Colombia. He grew up in Medellín in a modest family. He began criminal activity as a teenager, stealing tombstones and cars. He quickly moved into smuggling and drug trafficking. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Escobar built the Medellín Cartel into the world's largest cocaine trafficking organization. He was responsible for smuggling an estimated 15 tons of cocaine per day into the US. He used extreme violence including car bombings, assassinations of judges and politicians, and the bombing of Avianca Flight 203. He also cultivated a Robin Hood image by building housing and sports facilities for the poor. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
After surrendering in 1991, he was held in a luxury prison he designed himself ('La Catedral'). After escaping in 1992, a massive manhunt involving Colombian police, the US DEA, and the vigilante group Los Pepes tracked him down. He was shot and killed on a Medellín rooftop on December 2, 1993.
