## Summary

Rudolf Dassler founded Puma SE after splitting from his brother Adi, who founded Adidas. The brothers' bitter rivalry created two of the world's most famous sportswear brands, both headquartered in the same small German town of Herzogenaurach. The feud divided the town into two camps for decades. Puma grew into a major global sports brand competing directly with Adidas and Nike.
