## Summary

Zhang Ruimin transformed Haier Group from a failing refrigerator factory into the world's largest home appliance company. He famously smashed 76 defective refrigerators with a sledgehammer in 1985 to demonstrate his commitment to quality. Under his innovative management model called 'Rendanheyi,' Haier became a decentralized network of micro-enterprises. Haier acquired GE Appliances for $5.4 billion in 2016.
