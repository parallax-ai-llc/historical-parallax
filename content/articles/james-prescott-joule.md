## Summary

James Prescott Joule was a British physicist who established the mechanical equivalent of heat and laid the foundation for the first law of thermodynamics. His careful experiments demonstrated that heat is a form of energy, connecting mechanical work to thermal energy. The SI unit of energy, the joule, is named in his honor. He also discovered Joule's laws relating to heat produced by electric current.
