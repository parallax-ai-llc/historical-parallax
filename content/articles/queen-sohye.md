## Summary

Queen Sohye (1437-1504), also known as Queen Insu, was a shrewd political figure of the Joseon dynasty and Korea's first female author.[^1] Born into the prestigious Cheongju Han clan as the sixth daughter of Han Hwak, she became the wife of Crown Prince Uigyeong at age 15 and was widowed at 19.[^2] Despite never being the consort of a reigning king, she wielded extraordinary political influence as Queen Dowager during the reigns of her son King Seongjong and grandson Yeonsangun.[^3] Her authorship of the Naehun (Instructions for Women) in 1475 established her legacy as a pioneering female intellectual and educator in Korean history.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Queen Sohye was born on October 7, 1437, as Han Tosan (한도산; 韓桃山) or Han Sukdŏk (한숙덕; 韓淑德), a member of the Cheongju Han clan, one of Korea's most prestigious yangban families.[^5] She was the sixth daughter of Han Hwak (1400-1456), a prominent Joseon diplomat and politician who served as Left State Councillor, a position equivalent to vice prime minister.[^6] The Cheongju Han clan was classified as samhangapjok (삼한갑족), denoting the most royal clans of Korea, and had produced six queens, five princesses consort, three royal concubines, 315 scholars, 12 Sangshin, 14 Gongshin, and 1 Daejejak throughout the Joseon dynasty.[^7]

Born and raised in the capital, Queen Sohye received an exceptional education for a woman of her time.[^8] Coming from a family with a strong scholarly tradition and ties to the royal court, she was immersed in an environment of learning from an early age.[^9] She became fluent in Chinese, Korean, and Sanskrit, and was well-versed in literary classics.[^10] Queen Sohye Han was proficient in Classical Chinese, able to read and write freely, and was well versed not only in Confucian scriptures but also in Buddhist texts.[^11] This extraordinary educational foundation would later enable her to author the famous Naehun and to navigate the complex political landscape of the Joseon court with remarkable skill.

Her father, Han Hwak, was known for his strategic lobbying and fluency in Chinese, which facilitated key negotiations with Ming China envoys.[^12] He is mostly known through his second daughter, Queen Insu, who married the son of Prince Suyang.[^13] Additionally, Han Hwak's eldest daughter, Princess Consort Jeongseon, was the wife of Prince Gyeyang, a son of King Sejong the Great by a concubine, further cementing the family's connections to the royal household.[^14]

The political environment of Queen Sohye's youth was marked by dramatic upheaval. In 1453, when she was sixteen years old, the Gyeyujeongnan coup occurred—a watershed moment when Grand Prince Suyang led a coup d'état against the young King Danjong.[^15] On November 10, 1453, Prince Suyang killed Chief State Councillor Kim Jongseo and his faction, thereby seizing the reins of power.[^16] This bloody path to power culminated in 1455 when Suyang forced King Danjong to abdicate, declaring himself King Sejo.[^17] These violent political machinations would profoundly shape the court environment in which Queen Sohye would later exercise her considerable influence.

## Rise to Power

At around fifteen years of age, Queen Sohye married Crown Prince Uigyeong (Yi Jang, 1438-1457), the eldest son of the newly enthroned King Sejo and Queen Jeonghui.[^18] Crown Prince Uigyeong, also known as Prince Dowon before his elevation, was a diplomat and politician who served as the heir apparent to the Joseon throne.[^19] However, her life took a dramatic turn when she became a widow at just nineteen years old following her husband's sudden death on September 29, 1457.[^20] She was left with three young children to raise: Yi Jeong (Grand Prince Wolsan, born January 14, 1455), Princess Myeongsuk (born 1456), and Yi Hyeol (the future King Seongjong, born August 28, 1457).[^21]

Despite her widowhood and the fact that she never was the consort of a reigning king, Queen Sohye's political trajectory was extraordinary.[^22] When her father-in-law King Sejo's second son, King Yejong, died in 1469, the succession crisis thrust her family into the center of dynastic politics.[^23] Queen Jeonghui, her mother-in-law and Korea's first female regent, chose Queen Sohye's second son, the thirteen-year-old Yi Hyeol, to succeed as King Seongjong rather than her eldest son, Grand Prince Wolsan.[^24] This decision elevated Queen Sohye to the status of Queen Dowager (인수왕대비, Insu Wangdaebi).[^25]

In 1470, to legitimize Seongjong's succession, Crown Prince Uigyeong was posthumously honored as "King Deokjong" (덕종, 德宗) with the temple name, formally acknowledging him and Queen Sohye as Seongjong's royal parents.[^26] By designating Uigyeong as a king, Seongjong positioned himself as the direct son of a reigning monarch rather than merely the grandson of King Sejo, thereby reinforcing dynastic legitimacy and stabilizing the throne against potential rival claims.[^27]

Queen Jeonghui served as Joseon's first Queen Regent for her young grandson, King Seongjong, behind the bamboo silk screen between 1468 and 1476, with Queen Dowager Insu as her adviser.[^28] However, the relationship between the two queens was complex and sometimes strained. Initially, Queen Jeonghui had declined the regency role as she wasn't literate in classical Chinese and suggested her daughter-in-law, Queen Insu, instead, but the courtiers insisted she accept.[^29] Queen Jeonghui was wary of her daughter-in-law's ambition and while consulting on some official matters, preferred to be reserved and active only with affairs within the palace.[^30] Queen Insu's political influence was curtailed during this period, as she was yet to receive full royal honors and Queen Jeonghui at times acted independently, even without her knowledge.[^31]

The balance of power shifted decisively after Queen Jeonghui died in 1483.[^32] With her mother-in-law's passing, Queen Dowager Insu became the most influential elder in the palace, exerting a large part of royal power and elevating the Cheongju Han clan to unprecedented prominence.[^33]

## Major Achievements

### The Naehun: Korea's First Female-Authored Book

Queen Sohye's most enduring achievement was authoring the Naehun (內訓; Korean: 내훈; lit. "Instructions for Women") in 1475, the first known book written by a woman in Korea and, with the exception of a few poems, the first extended prose work by a female Korean author.[^34] She regretted that there were no educational books that women could read easily at that time, and wrote this book by extracting key points from four Chinese classical texts on women's education: Biographies of Exemplary Women (Lienu Zhuan), Lesser Learning (Xiaoxue), Mingxin Baojian, and Chinese Introduction for Women.[^35]

The book is composed of 3 volumes and 7 chapters, instructing women on discreet speech and manners, filial piety, marriage etiquette and harmony with relatives, duties between husband and wife, propriety as a mother, integrity, and frugality.[^36] The work is one of the most representative books that reflects the social construction of gender and sexuality based on neo-Confucian ideals in premodern East Asia.[^37]

However, recent scholarship has challenged traditional interpretations of the Naehun as simply promoting women's absolute submission to men.[^38] John Duncan's analysis in "The Naehun and the Politics of Gender in Fifteenth-Century Korea" argues that while the text pays lip service to Confucian virtues, it also seeks to carve out a place for women in society as agents of their own destiny, presenting women's roles as different from but not inferior to men's, with women serving as active agents in advising husbands and educating children.[^39] The most emphasized virtue of women in the Naehun is intellect, moral rectitude, and capability to act as counselors and remonstrators to their men, suggesting a subversive notion of a "blurred" demarcation of the inner and outer spheres.[^40]

The text collectively challenges three prevailing gendered social norms: the deprivation of education for girls, the necessity of the wife to obey her husband all the time, and the assumption of the moral inferiority of women, with authors arguing for the right of girls to schooling and the need for wives to remonstrate with their husbands.[^41] The book was published several times during different periods, and the notation, vocabulary and writing style changed as well, making it an important resource for the study of the Korean medieval language.[^42] TeRra Han, a 32nd generation descendant of Queen Sohye's family, translated Naehun into both English and Korean editions, making it an important resource for women's studies and East Asian gender and identity research.[^43]

### Political Influence and Governance

Queen Sohye's political acumen extended far beyond her literary achievements. She is mostly known for her proficiency in Chinese Classics, Confucianism and Buddhism, and for her involvement in political affairs from the accession of Grand Prince Suyang to the throne through the reign of Yeonsangun.[^44] Insu, with her exceptional education and powerful family connections, became a key figure at court, wielding significant influence despite becoming a widow at age 19.[^45]

During King Seongjong's reign (1469-1494), which was marked by prosperity and economic growth based on laws laid down by previous monarchs, Queen Sohye exercised considerable influence over policy.[^46] She had influenced state affairs because of the passage of various laws and policies.[^47] The reign saw important administrative achievements, including the completion of the Grand Code for State Administration (Gyeongguk Daejeon) in 1474, which Seongjong subsequently ordered revised and improved.[^48]

When she became Grand Queen Dowager Insu during the reign of her grandson Yeonsangun, she gathered even more power.[^49] However, this period would also see the most controversial episode of her political career.

### Support for Education and Culture

Beyond the Naehun, Queen Sohye's reign as Queen Dowager coincided with a cultural flourishing under King Seongjong. The king himself was an artist and intellectual who liked to argue about the finer points of politics with liberal scholars.[^50] He encouraged the publication of numerous books about geography and social etiquette, as well as knowledge that benefited common people.[^51] For the first time since King Sejong the Great, Confucian scholars whose political views clashed with conservative officials were brought to court, making governance more effective and resulting in many positive innovations.[^52]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### The Deposition and Execution of Deposed Queen Yun

The most significant controversy surrounding Queen Sohye involved her role in the deposition and execution of Deposed Queen Yun (1455-1482), King Seongjong's second wife and the mother of Prince Yeonsan.[^53] In 1479, when Queen Yun physically struck King Seongjong and left scratch marks on his face, Queen Insu discovered the truth and ordered Lady Yun into exile.[^54] Historical records suggest some debate about responsibility—some sources indicate King Seongjong himself led the removal, with Queen Sohye simply taking her son's side, saying to her subjects who desperately opposed the dethronement, "Mr. Yun's dethronement is right."[^55]

After several attempts to restore the deposed queen failed, government officials petitioned that she be executed.[^56] On August 29, 1482, Deposed Queen Yun was forced to drink poison and died, with the execution carried out under Queen Mother Insu's orchestration to eliminate lingering threats.[^57] Her death by poison became a source of recurrent political turmoil, culminating in the First Literati Purge organized in 1498 by her son Yeonsangun in the fourth year of his reign.[^58]

Historians continue to debate whether Deposed Queen Yun was a victim of Machiavellian politics or whether her actions were a reaction to personal trauma and the unforgiving court environment.[^59] A key debate centers on whether Yun's actions stemmed from deliberate malice or underlying mental instability, with retrospective medical assessments proposing bipolar disorder as an explanation for her documented episodes of extreme jealousy, impulsivity, and aggression toward rivals.[^60] Some view her execution as the culmination of a power struggle between three dominant factions vying for supremacy at court, with Yun's lack of strong allied factions leaving her vulnerable to coordinated attacks.[^61]

The charges detailed in the Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty have been scrutinized for potential exaggeration by Confucian scholar-officials, whose factional loyalties often prioritized moral orthodoxy and dynastic stability over impartiality.[^62] Whether she was simply another tragic victim of Joseon politics or a Machiavellian player in her own right remains open to interpretation.[^63]

### Violent Confrontation with Yeonsangun

The consequences of Queen Yun's execution would ultimately prove fatal for Queen Sohye herself. Yeonsangun eventually learned the truth about his biological mother and attempted to posthumously restore her titles and position, but government officials belonging to the Sarim faction opposed his efforts, greatly displeasing him.[^64] In 1504, after he was shown a blood-stained piece of clothing belonging to his mother, Yeonsangun beat to death two of his father's concubines, Lady Jeong and Lady Eom, for their part in his mother's death.[^65]

His grandmother, Grand Royal Queen Dowager Insu, also died soon after he pushed her during an altercation.[^66] She died in May 1504 at age 66, shortly after a confrontation with her grandson amid his escalating paranoia and resentment toward her political meddling.[^67] This brutal clash marked a tragic end to a life of extraordinary political influence.

### Role in Neo-Confucian Restrictions on Women

While Queen Sohye is celebrated as Korea's first female author, some scholars have noted the paradox of her role in promoting neo-Confucian values that increasingly restricted women's freedoms during the Joseon dynasty.[^68] After the fall of Goryeo and the establishment of the Joseon dynasty in 1392, neo-Confucianism was installed as the state ideology, profoundly affecting women's social status.[^69]

Women's declining social position has been attributed to the adoption of Neo-Confucian principles, with practices that gave women fewer rights than they had enjoyed in the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392).[^70] Households headed by women disappeared at the beginning of the Joseon era, and women gradually lost their rights to inheritance.[^71] Marriage patterns shifted from matrilocal (where men moved into their wives' families) to patrilocal (where women moved into their husbands' homes), and women lost property and inheritance rights.[^72]

By publishing works like the Samgang haengsil do (Conduct of the Three Bonds with Pictures), Sohak (Lesser Learning), and Juja garye (Zhu Xi's Family Rituals), the Joseon dynasty displayed great interest in enforcing Neo-Confucian social ethics and rituals.[^73] Queen Sohye's Naehun, despite its potentially progressive elements, was part of this broader ideological framework that codified women's subordinate position in the new Confucian social order.[^74]

## Personal Life

Queen Sohye married Crown Prince Uigyeong at approximately fifteen years of age and bore him three children before his untimely death in 1457.[^75] Her eldest son, Grand Prince Wolsan (Yi Jeong, 1455-1489), was born on January 14, 1455, and grew up under the love of his grandfather King Sejo.[^76] When Crown Prince Uigyeong was honored as King Deokjong in 1470, the Prince did not succeed his father as Crown Prince; instead, the throne was left to his youngest brother, Seongjong.[^77] Grand Prince Wolsan built a villa in Bukchon and spent his life reading books and writing poetry there, marrying Grand Princess Consort Seungpyeong of the Suncheon Park clan in 1466, though they had no children together.[^78] He did, however, have a son, Prince Deokpung, from Grand Princess Consort of the Wonju Kim clan.[^79]

Her daughter, Princess Myeongsuk (Yi Gyeong-geun), was born in 1456 and died in 1482.[^80] She was the older sister of King Seongjong and the younger sister of Grand Prince Wolsan.[^81]

Her youngest child, Yi Hyeol, born on August 28, 1457, became King Seongjong, the ninth king of the Joseon Dynasty, when his uncle King Yejong died in 1469.[^82] Crown Prince Uigyeong died in September 1457, leaving Queen Insu a widow with three young children, the youngest of whom was only a month old.[^83]

As a person, Queen Sohye demonstrated exceptional scholarly abilities and political acumen. She regretted the lack of accessible educational materials for women and took it upon herself to remedy this gap, demonstrating both intellectual independence and social consciousness.[^84] Her proficiency in multiple languages—Chinese, Korean, and Sanskrit—and her mastery of both Confucian and Buddhist texts set her apart as one of the most educated women of her era.[^85]

Her political involvement was active and direct. When faced with the controversy surrounding Deposed Queen Yun, she did not hesitate to take a clear position, stating to her subjects that "Mr. Yun's dethronement is right."[^86] This reveals a personality willing to exercise authority and make difficult decisions, even in the face of opposition.

The confrontation with her grandson Yeonsangun that led to her death suggests the limits of her political power in the face of an increasingly tyrannical monarch, but also her continued engagement in political affairs even in her final years.[^87]

## Legacy

Queen Sohye died on May 21, 1504, at the age of 66, and was granted the posthumous name Queen Sohye after her death.[^88] Her tomb is located at Gyeongneung Royal Tomb in Goyang, placed at the left of her husband's tomb (posthumously known as King Deokjong).[^89] Sohye's tomb was built in full regalia with the status of Grand Queen Dowager.[^90] Gyeongneung is part of Seooreung, the second-largest group of royal tombs of the Joseon Dynasty, which was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site as part of the Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty.[^91]

### Literary and Educational Legacy

Queen Sohye's authorship of the Naehun established her as Korea's first female author and a pioneering figure in women's education.[^92] She was evaluated as the best stateswoman in Joseon.[^93] The Naehun's influence extended across centuries, being republished multiple times with evolving notation, vocabulary, and writing style, serving both as an educational text and as an important resource for studying medieval Korean language.[^94]

The English edition of Naehun, translated by her 32nd-generation descendant TeRra Han, is considered an important resource for women's studies, as well as East Asian gender and identity research.[^95] Modern performances have also celebrated her legacy; TeRra Han has presented works exploring royal women's traditions in Asia through the Naehun at venues worldwide.[^96]

### Political Legacy

As a political figure, Queen Sohye's influence spanned multiple reigns, from the accession of Grand Prince Suyang to the throne through the reign of Yeonsangun.[^97] Her ability to navigate the treacherous political landscape of the early Joseon dynasty while exercising significant power—despite never being the consort of a reigning king—demonstrates her exceptional political acumen.[^98]

Her elevation of the Cheongju Han clan to unprecedented prominence had lasting effects on Korean aristocratic politics. The clan, already prestigious as one of Korea's samhangapjok families, produced six queens throughout the Joseon dynasty, more than any other clan, cementing their status among the yangban elite.[^99]

### Cultural Impact

Queen Sohye has been the subject of modern cultural representations, including the 2011-2012 television series "Insu, the Queen Mother," which dramatized her life and political influence.[^100] These contemporary reinterpretations reflect ongoing scholarly and popular interest in her complex role as both an advocate for women's education and a powerful political operator in a deeply patriarchal society.

Her life exemplifies the contradictions inherent in women's positions at the Joseon court—simultaneously constrained by Confucian patriarchal ideology yet capable of wielding extraordinary power through strategic alliances, intellectual achievement, and force of personality.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars recognize Queen Sohye as a pioneering intellectual whose literary achievement broke ground for female authorship in Korea.[^101] John Duncan and other contemporary historians have re-read the Naehun not merely as a text promoting women's submission but as a sophisticated work that advocates for women's education and intellectual development.[^102] Duncan argues that the text presents women as active agents capable of advising husbands and educating children, challenging the notion of absolute female subordination.[^103]

Her mastery of Classical Chinese, Korean, and Sanskrit, along with her knowledge of both Confucian and Buddhist texts, marked her as one of the most educated individuals—regardless of gender—of her era.[^104] The fact that she used this education to create the first comprehensive educational text for women demonstrates a commitment to expanding opportunities for female learning, even within the constraints of neo-Confucian ideology.[^105]

As a political figure, defenders point to her skill in navigating complex factional politics and her role as an effective adviser during multiple reigns.[^106] Her designation as "the best stateswoman in Joseon" reflects recognition of her political capabilities.[^107] During the regency period alongside Queen Jeonghui, and later as the most influential elder in the palace after 1483, she helped maintain political stability during critical transitions of power.[^108]

Some scholars view her involvement in the case of Deposed Queen Yun as a necessary act of political pragmatism rather than personal cruelty. In this interpretation, Queen Yun's violent behavior toward the king represented a genuine threat to dynastic stability, and Queen Sohye's response was that of a responsible political actor protecting the throne and the succession.[^109]

### Negative Views

Critics of Queen Sohye focus primarily on her role in the execution of Deposed Queen Yun, viewing it as an unforgivable abuse of power that led to decades of political bloodshed.[^110] The death of Queen Yun in 1482 directly precipitated Yeonsangun's reign of terror, including the brutal literati purges of 1498 and 1504.[^111] In the Second Literati Purge (Gapja Sahwa) of 1504, at least 36 officials were executed by drinking poison, the remains of eight deceased officials were mutilated, and a total of 239 officials were either executed, exiled, or dismissed, with the actual death toll much greater because victims' families and relatives were punished as well.[^112]

Some historians argue that Queen Sohye's orchestration of Queen Yun's elimination represented not political necessity but factional maneuvering designed to consolidate the Cheongju Han clan's power.[^113] In this view, her actions prioritized family interests over the welfare of the dynasty, ultimately contributing to one of the darkest periods in Joseon history.

The paradox of Queen Sohye's legacy troubles some feminist scholars: while she was Korea's first female author, the Naehun ultimately served to codify and promote neo-Confucian restrictions on women.[^114] Despite Duncan's nuanced re-reading, the text was understood by generations of Korean women as prescribing strict limitations on their behavior, speech, and autonomy.[^115] Her work thus became part of the ideological apparatus that enforced women's declining social position during the Joseon dynasty, when women lost property rights, inheritance rights, and social freedoms they had enjoyed under Goryeo.[^116]

Critics also point to the violent end of her life as evidence of the ultimately destructive nature of her political machinations. Her death in 1504 after being pushed by Yeonsangun during a confrontation represented a form of karmic justice in the eyes of those who viewed her treatment of his mother as unjust.[^117] The fact that Yeonsangun's paranoia and violence were directly traceable to the trauma of his mother's execution suggests that Queen Sohye's political calculations failed to account for the long-term consequences of her actions.[^118]
