## Summary

The **Katyn Massacre** was a series of mass executions of approximately **22,000 Polish officers, policemen, and intelligentsia** carried out by the Soviet secret police (**NKVD**) in April and May 1940. Approved by **Joseph Stalin** and the Soviet Politburo, the operation aimed to decapitate the Polish nation by eliminating its military and intellectual elite. For fifty years, the Soviet Union maintained a "Katyn Lie," blaming the massacre on Nazi Germany, until finally admitting responsibility in 1990.

## The Decision to Execute

### Context: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact
After the Soviet Union invaded eastern Poland in September 1939 (in coordination with Nazi Germany's invasion), they captured thousands of Polish officers. These prisoners were held in three special camps: **Kozelsk**, **Starobelsk**, and **Ostashkov**.

### Beria's Proposal
In March 1940, NKVD chief **Lavrentiy Beria** wrote a memo to Stalin. He argued that the Polish prisoners were "declared and hopeless enemies of Soviet authority" filled with hatred for the Soviet system. He recommended they be shot without trial.
*   **The Signature:** Stalin, Voroshilov, Molotov, and Mikoyan signed the order. It was a bureaucratic decision to exterminate a nation's leadership class.

## The Logistics of Mass Murder

The massacre was not limited to Katyn Forest; it occurred at three main sites:

1.  **Katyn Forest (Smolensk):** Prisoners from the Kozelsk camp were brought here. They were bound with rope, led to the edge of pits, and shot in the back of the head.
2.  **Kalinin (Tver):** Prisoners from the Ostashkov camp (mostly police and gendarmes) were executed in the basement of the local NKVD headquarters.
    *   **Vasily Blokhin:** The chief executioner, Blokhin, set up a soundproofed room. He notoriously wore a butcher's leather apron and long gloves. Working 10-hour nights, he personally shot over 7,000 men in 28 days using a suitcase full of German **Walther** pistols (chosen because they were reliable and the ammunition was plentiful, and to potentially frame the Germans later).
3.  **Kharkiv:** Prisoners from the Starobelsk camp were executed in the NKVD prison and buried in Piatykhatky.

The victims included generals, admirals, professors, physicians, lawyers, priests, and writers. It was a systematic purge of Poland's "brain trust."

## The "Katyn Lie" and Discovery

### 1943 Discovery
In April 1943, the Wehrmacht (German army) discovered the mass graves in Katyn Forest. Nazi Propaganda Minister **Joseph Goebbels** seized the opportunity to fracture the Allied alliance. He invited an **International Medical Commission** (doctors from occupied and neutral countries) to examine the bodies. They concluded the bodies had been buried for three years (1940), pointing to Soviet guilt.

### Soviet Counter-Propaganda
The USSR claimed the Nazis committed the crime during their 1941 invasion. When the Polish government-in-exile (London) asked for a Red Cross investigation, Stalin accused them of collaborating with Hitler and severed diplomatic ties.
*   **Burdenberg Commission:** After retaking Smolensk, the Soviets set up their own commission, planting false evidence (letters dated 1941) in the pockets of corpses to frame the Germans.

### The Nuremberg Trials
At Nuremberg, Soviet prosecutors indicted German leaders for Katyn. However, the evidence was so flimsy and the defense so effective in poking holes in the Soviet timeline that the judges quietly dropped the charge from the final verdict. It became an "open secret" in the West that the Soviets were guilty, but for diplomatic reasons (Cold War alliances), the US and UK governments often suppressed the topic.

## Disclosure and Aftermath

### 1990: The Truth
On April 13, 1990, the 50th anniversary, Soviet leader **Mikhail Gorbachev** finally admitted NKVD responsibility.
*   **1992:** Russian President **Boris Yeltsin** released the "Package No. 1"—the top-secret documents containing the original execution order with Stalin's signature—and handed copies to Polish President Lech Wałęsa.

### 2010 Smolensk Air Disaster
Tragedy struck again on April 10, 2010. A Polish government plane carrying President **Lech Kaczyński** and 95 of the country's highest-ranking officials crashed near Smolensk while attempting to land in thick fog. They were en route to a memorial service marking the 70th anniversary of the Katyn Massacre. Only a few miles from the original mass graves, Poland lost another generation of its elite, creating a haunting historical rhyme that deeply traumatized the nation.
