## Summary

Pierre Boulez was a French composer and conductor who was the most influential figure in postwar European music. His total serialism, as in Structures and Le marteau sans maitre, pushed musical organization to new extremes. As a conductor, he led the New York Philharmonic and the BBC Symphony Orchestra with legendary precision.
