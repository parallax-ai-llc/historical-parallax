## Summary

David Hilbert (1862-1943) was a German mathematician and philosopher of mathematics who ranks among the most influential mathematicians of the late 19th and early 20th centuries[^1]. His groundbreaking work spanned numerous fields including geometry, algebra, number theory, mathematical physics, and the foundations of mathematics[^2]. He is best known for his axiomatization of geometry, his famous list of 23 unsolved problems presented in 1900 that shaped mathematical research for decades, and his development of Hilbert space, a concept fundamental to quantum mechanics[^3]. As a professor at the University of Göttingen from 1895 to 1930, he transformed it into the world's preeminent center for mathematical research and mentored 69 doctoral students, many of whom became leading mathematicians[^4].

## Early Life and Background

David Hilbert was born on January 23, 1862, either in Königsberg or the nearby town of Wehlau (now Znamensk, Russia), in the Province of Prussia[^5]. His father, Otto Hilbert, served as a county judge whose own father had been a high-ranking Privy Councillor, while his mother, Maria Therese Erdtmann, was the daughter of a Königsberg merchant fascinated by philosophy, astronomy, and prime numbers[^6]. After Otto became a city judge, the family moved to Königsberg, where they lived at 13 Kirchenstrasse, the home in which David spent much of his childhood[^7].

Hilbert began his schooling at age eight, two years later than usual, likely having been taught at home by his mother until that time[^8]. In late 1872, he entered the Friedrichskolleg Gymnasium (Collegium fridericianum), the same school Immanuel Kant had attended 140 years earlier[^9]. Although reputed to be the best school in Königsberg, it emphasized Latin and Greek with mathematics considered less important, and science was not taught at all[^10]. After an unhappy period at this institution, Hilbert transferred to the more science-oriented Wilhelm Gymnasium in late 1879, from which he graduated in early 1880[^11].

Upon graduation, Hilbert enrolled at the University of Königsberg in autumn 1880[^12]. In early 1882, Hermann Minkowski, two years younger than Hilbert and also a Königsberg native who had spent three semesters in Berlin, returned to Königsberg and entered the university[^13]. Hilbert developed a lifelong friendship with the shy, gifted Minkowski, with whom he would take daily walks to discuss philosophy, literature, and above all mathematics—a friendship Max Born later described as one of "intimate friends from their school-days at Königsberg, and inseparable at the University"[^14]. Together with Adolf Hurwitz, another mathematician at Königsberg, they formed the habit of taking daily walks "to the apple tree... precisely at five," discussing profound questions and forming friendships that would last to their graves[^15]. Hilbert's mathematical training came less from lectures, teachers, or books than from these conversations with Hurwitz and Minkowski[^16].

## Rise to Power

Hilbert received his doctorate in mathematics from the University of Königsberg in 1885, just five years after enrolling[^17]. He remained at Königsberg as a Privatdozent (senior lecturer) from 1886 to 1895, a period during which he began producing groundbreaking work that would establish his reputation[^18]. His first major achievement came in 1888 when he demonstrated his famous finiteness theorem, known as Hilbert's basis theorem, showing the existence of a finite set of generators for the invariants of quantics in any number of variables in an abstract form[^19]. This work on invariant theory revolutionized the field by proving that all invariants can be expressed in terms of a finite number[^20].

In 1893, the Association of German Mathematicians commissioned Hilbert and Minkowski to prepare a report on recent developments in number theory[^21]. While Minkowski eventually abandoned his portion, Hilbert produced the Zahlbericht (The Theory of Algebraic Number Fields), published in 1897[^22]. This monumental work discussed the basic arithmetic theory of finite extensions of the field of rational numbers, covering integers, ideals, discriminants, units, ideal classes, cyclotomic fields including the Kronecker-Weber theorem, and Kummer number fields, ending with Kummer's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem for regular primes[^23]. The Zahlbericht became the principal textbook on algebraic number theory for at least thirty years and served as the starting point for all twentieth-century investigations in algebraic number theory, reciprocity laws, and class field theory[^24].

In 1895, as a result of intervention on his behalf by Felix Klein, Hilbert obtained the position of Professor of Mathematics at the University of Göttingen[^25]. This appointment marked a turning point not only in Hilbert's career but in the history of mathematics itself. During what became known as the Klein and Hilbert years, Göttingen became the preeminent institution in the mathematical world[^26]. Hilbert used his position strategically: when the University of Berlin offered him a prestigious position in 1902, he leveraged the offer to persuade Göttingen to create a new chair specifically for his friend Minkowski, bringing him to Göttingen and resuming their daily mathematical walks[^27]. Under Hilbert's leadership, Göttingen evolved into what one historian described as "the paradigm of modern universities, the place where students and researchers of mathematics and related sciences from around the world wanted to go to complete their training or progress in their research"[^28].

## Major Achievements

### Foundations of Geometry

One of Hilbert's most celebrated achievements was his revolutionary work on the foundations of geometry, culminating in the publication of *Grundlagen der Geometrie* (Foundations of Geometry) in 1899[^29]. This popular book, which appeared in 10 editions, marked a turning point in the axiomatic treatment of geometry[^30]. Hilbert's systematic study of the axioms of Euclidean geometry led him to propose 21 axioms organized into five groups, analyzing their significance and mutual independence[^31]. His approach signaled the shift to the modern axiomatic method and had the greatest influence in geometry since Euclid[^32]. Rather than relying on intuition or physical models, Hilbert demonstrated that geometry could be built entirely on logical foundations, with axioms that could be examined independently for consistency and completeness[^33].

### Hilbert's 23 Problems

In August 1900, Hilbert was invited to address the Second International Congress of Mathematicians at the Sorbonne in Paris[^34]. For this occasion, he prepared a list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems, presenting ten of them (Problems 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 13, 16, 19, 21, and 22) in his lecture on August 8[^35]. These problems were all unsolved at the time and were carefully chosen to guide mathematical research into the twentieth century[^36]. The list included the Continuum Hypothesis (Problem 1), the Riemann Hypothesis (Problem 8), determining the solvability of Diophantine equations (Problem 10), and developments in the calculus of variations (Problem 23)[^37]. In the 120 years since Hilbert's talk, some problems have been solved while others, including Problems 8, 12, and 16, remain unresolved[^38]. Nevertheless, they spurred innovation and generalization across mathematics, with Hilbert's substantial fame resting significantly on this visionary list[^39].

### Algebraic Number Theory

Hilbert's 1897 Zahlbericht transformed algebraic number theory from a collection of isolated results into a unified, systematic theory[^40]. Emil Artin, Helmut Hasse, Erich Hecke, Hermann Weyl, and many others learned their number theory from this book[^41]. The work covered the fundamental arithmetic theory of algebraic number fields, including the theory of ideals that had been developed by Richard Dedekind and Leopold Kronecker, and extended it significantly[^42]. Hilbert's treatment of cyclotomic fields and Kummer extensions provided the foundation for the development of class field theory in the twentieth century[^43].

### Hilbert Space and Functional Analysis

Hilbert's work in 1909 on integral equations led to twentieth-century research in functional analysis and established the basis for his work on infinite-dimensional space, later called Hilbert space[^44]. He first described this space in his work on integral equations and Fourier series, introducing the concept of an infinite-dimensional Euclidean space[^45]. While other mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl and Norbert Wiener had already studied particular Hilbert spaces from physically motivated viewpoints, John von Neumann coined the term "abstract Hilbert space" and gave the first complete axiomatic treatment[^46]. The concept proved fundamental to mathematical analysis and became crucial to the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics[^47]. The algebra of observables in quantum mechanics is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation[^48].

### Calculus of Variations and Dirichlet's Principle

In 1900, Hilbert justified Riemann's use of Dirichlet's principle by developing the direct method in the calculus of variations[^49]. This achievement resolved a controversy that had persisted since 1870, when Karl Weierstrass criticized Riemann's assumption by providing an example of a functional with a greatest lower bound that was not a minimum value[^50]. In 1899, Hilbert gave a rigorous justification of the Dirichlet principle under certain assumptions about the boundary of the domain, marking the beginning of a major program to put the calculus of variations on a rigorous foundation[^51].

### Contributions to Physics

Hilbert played an important role in establishing quantum physics in Göttingen[^52]. Between 1904 and 1909, he worked extensively on the Dirichlet principle, calculus of variations, integral equations, and Waring's problem[^53]. In the summer of 1905, Minkowski and Hilbert led an advanced seminar on electrodynamical theory, which became important for Minkowski's later work on relativity[^54]. In November 1915, Hilbert became involved in a famous "race" with Albert Einstein to derive the correct gravitational field equations of general relativity[^55]. While Hilbert's paper was submitted on November 20, 1915, just days before Einstein submitted his final paper on November 25, historians have established that Einstein deserves priority[^56]. As Stephen Hawking noted, "Einstein had discussed his ideas with the mathematician David Hilbert during a visit to the University of Göttingen in the summer of 1915, and Hilbert independently found the same equations a few days before Einstein. Nevertheless, as Hilbert admitted, the credit for the new theory belonged to Einstein"[^57].

### Formalism and the Foundations of Mathematics

In the early 1920s, Hilbert formulated what became known as Hilbert's Program, a proposed solution to the foundational crisis of mathematics[^58]. The program called for a formalization of all mathematics in axiomatic form, together with a consistency proof to be carried out using only "finitistic" methods[^59]. Hilbert introduced formalism, a school of thought holding that all mathematics can be reduced to rules for manipulating formulas without reference to their meanings[^60]. The central idea was "that mathematics is not a body of propositions representing an abstract sector of reality, but is much more akin to a game"[^61]. The special epistemological character of finitary reasoning, Hilbert believed, would yield the required justification of classical mathematics[^62].

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems

The most significant challenge to Hilbert's work came in 1931 when Kurt Gödel published his incompleteness theorems, which showed that Hilbert's Program was unattainable for key areas of mathematics[^63]. Gödel's first theorem demonstrated that any consistent system with a computable set of axioms capable of expressing arithmetic can never be complete—it is possible to construct statements that can be shown to be true but cannot be derived from the formal rules of the system[^64]. His second theorem showed that such a system could not prove its own consistency, directly refuting Hilbert's assumption that a finitistic system could prove its own consistency[^65]. However, the question of whether Gödel's theorems completely refuted Hilbert's Program remains debated, with some arguing that a wider notion of finitary methods might salvage aspects of the program[^66]. Gödel himself remarked that it was largely Turing's work in 1937, particularly the "precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the notion of formal system," that convinced him his incompleteness theorems were fully general and refuted the Hilbert Program[^67].

### The Einstein-Hilbert Priority Dispute

The near-simultaneous derivation of the gravitational field equations of general relativity by both Einstein and Hilbert in November 1915 led to what historians call a priority dispute[^68]. Hilbert submitted his paper on November 20, and even sent Einstein a copy which probably reached Einstein before he submitted his own paper on November 25[^69]. In the late 1990s, historian Leo Corry made a remarkable discovery—he found a copy of the proofs of Hilbert's paper with a printer's stamp dating it to December 6, 1915, which helped clarify the priority question in Einstein's favor[^70]. The episode raised questions about scientific priority and the ethics of collaboration, though Hilbert himself acknowledged that credit for the new theory belonged to Einstein[^71].

### Response to His Son's Mental Illness

Hilbert's personal life contained elements that modern observers find troubling. His only son, Franz Hilbert (1893-1969), suffered throughout his life from mental illness[^72]. After Franz was admitted to a psychiatric clinic, Hilbert reportedly said, "From now on, I must consider myself as not having a son"[^73]. This attitude brought his wife Käthe considerable sorrow[^74]. While attitudes toward mental illness differed in early twentieth-century Germany, Hilbert's apparent rejection of his son has been viewed critically by biographers as revealing limitations in his personal character despite his intellectual brilliance[^75].

### Silence During the Nazi Era

Although Hilbert "always remained free of all national and racist prejudices" and had been influenced by two Jewish mathematicians, Adolf Hurwitz and Hermann Minkowski[^76], his final years were spent in Nazi Germany watching helplessly as his beloved Göttingen was destroyed. The 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service made it illegal for non-Aryans to serve as professors[^77]. Over the course of that year, 18 mathematicians left or were driven out from Göttingen, including Emmy Noether, Richard Courant, and Hermann Weyl[^78]. While Hilbert clearly opposed these expulsions and made his famous remark to Nazi education minister Bernhard Rust in 1934 that "There is no mathematics in Göttingen anymore"[^79], some have questioned whether he could or should have done more to actively resist or publicly denounce the Nazi policies that destroyed the institution he had built[^80].

---

## Personal Life

In 1892, Hilbert married Käthe Jerosch (1864-1945), who was the daughter of a Königsberg merchant and also his second cousin[^81]. They married on October 12, 1892[^82]. While at Königsberg, they had their only child, Franz Hilbert, born on August 11, 1893[^83]. Franz's lifelong struggle with mental illness cast a shadow over the family, creating a source of profound sorrow for Käthe and revealing a painful side of Hilbert's character in his response to his son's condition[^84].

Hilbert was baptized and raised a Calvinist in the Prussian Evangelical Church, but he later left the Church and became an agnostic[^85]. His personality was shaped by his conversational approach to mathematics—he learned less from formal instruction than from dialogue with friends like Hurwitz and Minkowski[^86]. This collaborative spirit characterized his entire career and influenced his teaching philosophy at Göttingen[^87].

As a teacher, Hilbert emphasized clarity, precision, and love for the subject, with his famous dictum "We must know, we shall know" encapsulating his optimism and belief in the power of human intellect[^88]. He inspired many of his students to become mathematicians, with his 69 doctoral students including Otto Blumenthal (1898), Felix Bernstein (1901), Hermann Weyl (1908), Richard Courant (1910), Erich Hecke (1910), Hugo Steinhaus (1911), and Wilhelm Ackermann (1925)[^89]. John von Neumann served as his assistant[^90]. At Göttingen, Hilbert surrounded himself with a social circle of some of the most important mathematicians of the twentieth century, including Emmy Noether and Alonzo Church[^91].

The death of Hermann Minkowski in 1909 deeply affected Hilbert[^92]. In a memorial address, Hilbert spoke movingly about his friend: "Our science, which we loved above everything, had brought us together. It appeared to us as a flowering garden," describing how they "liked to seek out hidden trails and discovered many a novel view, beautiful to behold"[^93]. Hermann Weyl described Hilbert's lifelong friendship with Minkowski as being "of a very intimate character"[^94]. This friendship represented one of the most productive and enduring partnerships in the history of mathematics[^95].

## Legacy

David Hilbert's retirement from his professorship in 1930 marked the beginning of a tragic decline for Göttingen mathematics[^96]. His retirement years were spent in Nazi Germany, where Jewish mathematicians who had been his friends and colleagues were systematically banished from Göttingen[^97]. By 1933, when Hitler mandated the removal of all Jews from university positions, the department at Göttingen was effectively gutted[^98]. Göttingen's rise to mathematical primacy had occurred over generations, but its fall took less than a decade as its stars were pushed abroad by the advent of National Socialism[^99]. The university's best minds left Germany in the early 1930s, transferring Göttingen's substantial mathematical legacy to Princeton, New York University, and other British and American universities[^100].

Hilbert died on February 14, 1943, at age 81, succumbing to a compound fracture of the thigh brought about by a domestic accident[^101]. His funeral was attended by fewer than a dozen people, only two of whom were fellow academics, among them Arnold Sommerfeld, a theoretical physicist and also a native of Königsberg[^102]. This sparse attendance reflected how completely the Nazis had restaffed the university after Jewish faculty were expelled[^103]. News of his death became known to the wider world only several months after he died[^104]. He was buried in the city cemetery in Göttingen (Stadtfriedhof Göttingen), with his tombstone bearing the famous words he spoke at the conclusion of his retirement address on September 8, 1930: "Wir müssen wissen, Wir werden wissen" ("We must know, we will know")[^105].

Despite the tragic circumstances of his final years, Hilbert's legacy survived and flourished. His axiomatic approach transformed not only geometry but the entire conception of mathematical rigor[^106]. The 23 problems guided mathematical research throughout the twentieth century and continue to inspire work in the twenty-first[^107]. Hilbert space became indispensable to quantum mechanics and modern physics[^108]. His work on algebraic number theory, invariant theory, and functional analysis opened entire fields of investigation[^109]. The genesis and development of the axiomatic method as understood today is inextricably linked to Hilbert's name, making him a major source of influence on mathematics in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries[^110].

Göttingen's legacy survives today in other mathematical research powerhouses around the world, as many of its displaced scholars helped establish major mathematical centers elsewhere[^111]. Hilbert's 69 doctoral students and their intellectual descendants spread his vision of mathematics across the globe[^112]. His formalist philosophy, though challenged by Gödel's theorems, continues to influence current lines of research in mathematical logic, proof theory, and reverse mathematics, which can be viewed as natural continuations of Hilbert's original program[^113].

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Mathematicians and historians widely regard David Hilbert as one of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century and probably the most influential[^114]. His work spanned an unprecedented breadth of fields while maintaining exceptional depth in each[^115]. Hermann Weyl, one of Hilbert's most distinguished students, provided what many consider the definitive assessment of Hilbert's contributions in his memorial address, emphasizing how Hilbert's ability to identify the most fundamental problems and develop powerful general methods to solve them shaped the course of modern mathematics[^116].

Hilbert's optimism about the solvability of mathematical problems inspired generations of mathematicians[^117]. His famous declaration "We must know, we will know" represents the conviction that no problem is unsolvable in principle and that human reason, properly applied, can penetrate any mystery[^118]. This optimistic vision stood in stark contrast to the limitations suggested by Gödel's work but provided a motivating ethos for mathematical research[^119].

The axiomatic method that Hilbert developed and championed became the standard for mathematical rigor in the twentieth century[^120]. His *Grundlagen der Geometrie* demonstrated how entire mathematical structures could be built from clearly stated axioms, with no reliance on intuition or physical models[^121]. This approach influenced not only pure mathematics but also theoretical physics, logic, and computer science[^122].

Scholars particularly praise Hilbert's ability to identify problems of fundamental importance[^123]. The 23 problems presented in 1900 demonstrated extraordinary mathematical vision, anticipating developments that would occur decades later[^124]. That several remain unsolved more than a century later testifies to their depth and significance[^125]. The Riemann Hypothesis (Problem 8), for instance, continues to be considered one of the most important unsolved problems in all of mathematics[^126].

### Negative Views

Despite Hilbert's towering achievements, critics have identified limitations and shortcomings in both his work and character. The most significant intellectual criticism concerns his formalist program, which Gödel's incompleteness theorems demonstrated was fundamentally flawed[^127]. Some philosophers and mathematicians argue that Hilbert's formalism represented an overly mechanistic view of mathematics that failed to account for the irreducible role of meaning and intuition in mathematical thought[^128]. The incompleteness theorems showed that Hilbert's dream of a complete, consistent, finitary foundation for mathematics was impossible in principle[^129].

On a personal level, Hilbert's response to his son Franz's mental illness reveals troubling limitations in his character[^130]. His apparent rejection of Franz and the statement that he must "consider myself as not having a son" demonstrates a lack of compassion that contrasts sharply with his intellectual brilliance[^131]. While one must account for different historical attitudes toward mental illness, this episode has led some biographers to question whether Hilbert's single-minded dedication to mathematics came at too great a personal cost[^132].

Hilbert's final years in Nazi Germany raise difficult questions about the responsibilities of intellectuals under totalitarian regimes[^133]. Although he clearly opposed the expulsion of Jewish mathematicians and made his famous remark about there being "no mathematics in Göttingen anymore," some argue he could have been more vocal or active in his opposition[^134]. However, defenders note that Hilbert was in his seventies when the Nazis came to power, in declining health, and had limited ability to influence events[^135]. His lifelong friendship with Jewish mathematicians and consistent opposition to prejudice suggests his convictions were genuine, even if circumstances prevented more effective action[^136].

Some historians have also questioned aspects of the Einstein-Hilbert priority dispute, suggesting that Hilbert may have been influenced by Einstein's ideas more than he initially acknowledged[^137]. However, most scholars conclude that Hilbert acted honorably throughout the episode and properly acknowledged Einstein's priority[^138].

Finally, critics note that while Hilbert's breadth was extraordinary, he sometimes moved from field to field without fully developing all implications of his work, leaving this task to students and successors[^139]. This approach, while productive in generating new areas of research, occasionally left fundamental questions unresolved[^140].
