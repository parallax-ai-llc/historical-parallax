## Overview

On December 17, 1903, on the windy dunes of Kill Devil Hills near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, Orville and Wilbur Wright achieved the first successful flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft. The *Wright Flyer* stayed aloft for just 12 seconds and covered 120 feet—less than the wingspan of a modern Boeing 747—but it changed the world forever. The brothers, bicycle mechanics from Dayton, Ohio, solved the problem of flight not with brute power, but by inventing **three-axis control**, allowing a pilot to steer the aircraft effectively. Their invention shrunk the globe, revolutionized warfare, and launched the aerospace age.

## The Brothers

**Orville (1871-1948) & Wilbur (1867-1912):**
- From Dayton, Ohio.
- Neither finished high school (officially).
- Ran a bicycle shop.
- Self-taught engineers. Obsessive, meticulous.
- Lifelong bachelors; lived together.

## The Problem of Flight

**Predecessors:**
Others (Lilienthal, Langley) tried and failed. Most focused on powerful engines.

**The Wright Insight:**
**Control** is the key. An airplane needs to be balanced like a bicycle.
They observed birds twisting their wingtips to turn.

**Three-Axis Control:**
1. **Roll:** Wing-warping (modern ailerons).
2. **Pitch:** Elevator (front canard).
3. **Yaw:** Rear rudder (coordinated with wings).

## Development

### 1899-1902: Gliders

**Wind Tunnel:**
Brothers built their own wind tunnel. Tested 200+ wing shapes. Discovered existing lift data (Smeaton coefficient) was wrong. Wrote their own aerodynamics data.

**Kitty Hawk:**
Chose location for steady winds and soft sand (for crashes).

### 1903: The Power

**The Engine:**
No auto engine was light enough. They built their own 12-horsepower aluminum engine with mechanic Charlie Taylor.

**The Propeller:**
Realized propeller is a rotating wing. Designed highly efficient props (66% efficiency).

## December 17, 1903

### The Attempt

Cold, windy morning. Orville won coin toss to try first.

### Flight 1 (10:35 AM)

**Pilot:** Orville
**Duration:** 12 seconds
**Distance:** 120 feet
**Speed:** 6.8 mph (ground speed)

**The Photo:**
John T. Daniels (lifesaving station crewman) snapped the famous photo—Orville flying, Wilbur running alongside.

### Flights 2 & 3

Slightly longer.

### Flight 4 (12:00 PM)

**Pilot:** Wilbur
**Duration:** 59 seconds
**Distance:** 852 feet

### The End

A gust of wind flipped the *Flyer* while parked. It was damaged and never flew again.

## Skepticism

### "Flyers or Liars?"

**Secrecy:**
Wrights feared patent theft. Stopped flying publicly for years.

**Press Ignored It:**
Only local papers reported it initially. *Scientific American* mocked them.
Prof. Samuel Langley (funded by government) had failed days earlier; public thought flight impossible.

**1908 France Demo:**
Wilbur finally flew publicly in Le Mans, France. Stunned the world with full circles and control. Skeptics silenced.

---

## Legal Wars

**Patent Wars:**
Spent years suing Glenn Curtiss and others. Stifled US aviation development (allowing Europe to catch up/surpass by WWI).

**Smithsonian Feud:**
Smithsonian claimed Langley flew first (to save face). Orville sent the original *Flyer* to London Science Museum in protest. Returned to USA only in 1948.

## Legacy

### Aviation Age

- **1903:** First flight
- **1914:** First air war
- **1927:** Lindbergh crosses Atlantic
- **1947:** Sound barrier broken
- **1969:** Moon landing (Neil Armstrong carried piece of *Wright Flyer* to Moon)

### Impact

- Transportation: Global travel
- War: Air dominance
- Commerce: FedEx, Amazon

The Wrights are unique: they invented the *technology*, the *science* (aerodynamics), and the *skill* (piloting) all at once.
