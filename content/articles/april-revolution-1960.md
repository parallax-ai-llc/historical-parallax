## Overview

The April Revolution (4.19 혁명) was a popular uprising in South Korea that led to the resignation of President Syngman Rhee on April 26, 1960. Triggered by widespread electoral fraud in the March 1960 presidential election and the discovery of a student's body killed by police, the revolution marked South Korea's first successful democratic uprising.

## Background

### Syngman Rhee's Rule (1948-1960)

**First Republic:**
Syngman Rhee became South Korea's first president in 1948. Initially seen as independence hero, his rule became increasingly authoritarian:

- Constitutional amendments to extend power
- Suppression of political opposition
- Corruption and cronyism
- Economic stagnation

**1960 Presidential Election (March 15):**
Vice-presidential election between Lee Ki-poong (ruling Liberal Party) and Chang Myon (Democratic Party) was blatantly rigged:
- Pre-marked ballots
- Voter intimidation
- Vote counting fraud
- 40% pre-voting claimed

Results: Lee Ki-poong declared winner with implausible margins.

## Trigger: Kim Ju-yeol's Death

**Discovery (April 11, 1960):**
Body of Kim Ju-yeol, a 17-year-old high school student from Masan, found floating in Masan harbor with a tear gas grenade lodged in his head.

Kim had disappeared during March 15 protests against election fraud.

**Public Outrage:**
Photo of Kim's body published widely. Proof of police brutality galvanized nation.

## The Uprising

### April 19, 1960 ("Bloody Tuesday")

Students from Korea University, Yonsei University, and high schools marched on the Blue House (presidential residence).

**Government Response:**
Police opened fire on protesters.

**Casualties:**
- ~180 killed
- Over 6,000 wounded

**Public Reaction:**
Rather than suppressing movement, violence inflamed it. Protests spread nationwide.

### April 25-26

**Professors' March:**
University professors marched in support of students—significant moral authority.

**Military Refusal:**
Army Chief of Staff refused to shoot civilians, told Rhee: "We cannot fire on students."

Rhee announced resignation, later exiled to Hawaii (died 1965).
