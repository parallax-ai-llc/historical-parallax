## Overview
The April Revolution was triggered by the discovery of the body of a high school student killed by a tear gas grenade during protests against electoral fraud. Mass protests erupted across the country, particularly in Seoul.

## Outcome
President Syngman Rhee resigned and went into exile. The revolution marked the first successful democratic uprising in South Koreas history, though it was followed by a military coup a year later.
