## Summary

Nicolás Maduro Moros has served as President of Venezuela since 2013, succeeding his mentor Hugo Chávez after his death from cancer. Born into a working-class leftist family in Caracas, Maduro rose from bus driver to trade union leader before entering politics and becoming one of Chávez's most trusted allies. His presidency has been marked by severe economic crisis, mass emigration, contested elections, widespread human rights violations, and international isolation, with more than 50 countries refusing to recognize his legitimacy. Despite facing numerous challenges including coup attempts, sanctions, and allegations of crimes against humanity, Maduro has maintained power through military loyalty, support from authoritarian allies like Russia and China, and systematic repression of opposition.

## Early Life and Background

Nicolás Maduro Moros was born on November 23, 1962, in Caracas, Venezuela, into a working-class leftist family in the neighborhood of Los Jardines, El Valle, on the western outskirts of the capital.[^1] The only male among four siblings, Maduro grew up alongside his three sisters—María Teresa, Josefina, and Anita—in a household steeped in progressive politics.[^2] His father, Nicolás Maduro García, was a prominent leftist trade union leader and labor organizer, while his mother, Teresa de Jesús Moros, helped nurture the family's commitment to social justice.[^3]

Growing up on Calle 14 in a neighborhood of modest means, Maduro was exposed from an early age to the struggles of Venezuela's working class and the labor movement's efforts to improve their conditions.[^4] This environment profoundly shaped his political consciousness and worldview. Rather than pursuing a traditional university education, Maduro's early interest in left-wing politics led him to seek training as a political organizer in Cuba, reflecting the influence of revolutionary socialism on his ideological development.[^5]

As a young man, Maduro worked as a bus driver for the Caracas Metro system, a job that would become central to his political identity and narrative.[^6] This working-class occupation connected him directly to the daily realities of ordinary Venezuelans and provided him with a platform to engage in labor organizing. While working as a bus driver, Maduro became actively involved with the transit workers' union, quickly rising through its ranks due to his organizing skills and commitment to workers' rights.[^7] His success as a union representative demonstrated his ability to mobilize people and navigate organizational politics—skills that would prove crucial in his subsequent political career.

During this formative period, Maduro developed a deep commitment to Bolivarian socialism and anti-imperialist politics, ideologies that would define his entire political trajectory. His working-class background and union experience became core elements of his political identity, distinguishing him from many Venezuelan politicians who came from more privileged backgrounds or traditional educational pathways.[^8]

## Rise to Power

Maduro's entry into national politics began in the early 1990s when he joined the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200), the clandestine organization founded by Hugo Chávez and other military officers who sought to transform Venezuela's political system.[^9] When Chávez led an unsuccessful coup attempt against President Carlos Andrés Pérez in February 1992, Maduro became one of his most dedicated supporters, actively campaigning for Chávez's release during his two years of imprisonment.[^10]

It was during this period that Maduro met Cilia Flores, the lawyer working on Chávez's case, who would later become his wife and political partner.[^11] After Chávez was pardoned in 1994, Maduro played an instrumental role in founding the Movement of the Fifth Republic (MVR), the political party that would carry Chávez to the presidency.[^12] This early loyalty to Chávez when his political future was uncertain earned Maduro a reputation as one of the movement's most faithful adherents.

When Chávez won the presidency in 1998 with 56.2% of the vote, launching the Bolivarian Revolution, Maduro's political ascent accelerated.[^13] In 2000, he was elected to the National Assembly, beginning his formal career in government.[^14] Over the next twelve years, Maduro steadily climbed the ranks of Chávez's administration, demonstrating unwavering loyalty to the leader he referred to as "Comandante."

Maduro's most significant appointments came in the latter half of Chávez's presidency. From 2005 to 2006, he served as President of the National Assembly, gaining valuable legislative experience.[^15] In 2006, Chávez appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held until 2012.[^16] As foreign minister, Maduro traveled extensively, building relationships with leftist governments throughout Latin America and strengthening Venezuela's ties with countries like Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, and Nicaragua, as well as with more distant allies such as Iran, Russia, and China.[^17]

The most crucial moment in Maduro's rise came in October 2012, when Chávez, already battling cancer, appointed him as vice president.[^18] By this time, Chávez's health had severely deteriorated, and he was preparing for another round of surgery in Cuba. Before departing for medical treatment in December 2012, Chávez made a televised address in which he publicly named Maduro as his preferred successor, telling supporters that if something happened to him, they should vote for Maduro to continue the Bolivarian Revolution.[^19]

When Chávez died on March 5, 2013, Maduro immediately assumed the presidency as interim president on March 8, 2013.[^20] A special presidential election was scheduled for April 14, 2013, to determine who would serve out the remainder of Chávez's term. In a highly charged campaign, Maduro positioned himself as the rightful heir to Chávez's legacy, frequently invoking the late president's name and declaring himself "the son of Chávez."[^21]

The election results were remarkably close. Maduro was declared the winner with just 50.62% of the vote, defeating opposition candidate Henrique Capriles by a razor-thin margin of approximately 1.5%—a stark contrast to Chávez's commanding electoral victories.[^22] The opposition immediately contested the results, alleging widespread irregularities and fraud, and refused to recognize Maduro's victory.[^23] This narrow, disputed victory cast a shadow over Maduro's presidency from the very beginning, robbing him of the strong popular mandate that Chávez had always enjoyed and raising questions about his legitimacy that would persist throughout his tenure.[^24]

## Major Achievements

Upon assuming office, Maduro sought to establish his own presidential programs while maintaining continuity with Chávez's Bolivarian Revolution. One of his first major initiatives was the "Safe Homeland" (Patria Segura) program, launched in 2013 as a massive police and military campaign designed to address Venezuela's severe crime problem.[^25] The program deployed thousands of soldiers to high-crime areas in an effort to reduce Venezuela's soaring homicide rate and improve public security. Maduro presented this initiative as evidence of his commitment to protecting Venezuelan citizens and responding to one of their most pressing concerns.[^26]

In the realm of social policy, Maduro expanded several of the "missions" that Chávez had created to provide services to Venezuela's poor, including housing, healthcare, and education programs.[^27] He continued subsidies for basic goods and maintained price controls that were popular among lower-income Venezuelans who depended on access to affordable food and essential items.[^28] The government also continued various cash transfer programs and maintained free healthcare through the Barrio Adentro program, which brought Cuban doctors to underserved communities.[^29]

Maduro portrayed himself as a champion of the working class and defender of Venezuelan sovereignty against what he characterized as U.S. imperialism and interventionism.[^30] He positioned Venezuela as a leader of anti-imperialist resistance in Latin America and maintained strong relationships with leftist governments in the region, including Cuba, Bolivia, and Nicaragua.[^31] His government continued to provide subsidized oil to Cuba and other allied nations through programs like Petrocaribe, which offered preferential financing terms to Caribbean countries.[^32]

In the diplomatic sphere, Maduro worked to strengthen Venezuela's relationships with major powers outside the Western orbit, particularly Russia and China.[^33] These countries provided crucial financial support through loans and investments, particularly in Venezuela's oil sector, which helped the government maintain some degree of economic stability during the early years of his presidency.[^34] Maduro framed these partnerships as a way of creating a "multipolar world" that would reduce U.S. influence in Latin America and provide Venezuela with alternatives to Western financial institutions.[^35]

Maduro's government also invested in military modernization, purchasing weapons systems from Russia and conducting joint military exercises designed to demonstrate Venezuela's defensive capabilities.[^36] He consistently emphasized military preparedness and national defense, warning of potential foreign intervention and positioning the armed forces as guardians of the Bolivarian Revolution.[^37]

In terms of constitutional and political initiatives, Maduro convened a Constituent Assembly in 2017, which was granted sweeping powers that effectively superseded the opposition-controlled National Assembly.[^38] Supporters argued this was necessary to address the political crisis and update Venezuela's constitution, though critics viewed it as an authoritarian power grab designed to neutralize democratic opposition.[^39]

Additionally, Maduro presided over a referendum in December 2023 regarding Venezuela's territorial claims to the Essequibo region, a resource-rich area administered by Guyana but claimed by Venezuela.[^40] The government reported overwhelming support for Venezuela's position, which Maduro portrayed as a vindication of Venezuelan sovereignty and national interests, though the referendum had low turnout and contributed to regional tensions.[^41]

Despite the severe economic crisis that developed during his presidency, Maduro's government implemented some economic reforms in his second term, including relaxing currency controls and allowing greater use of the U.S. dollar in domestic transactions, which helped stabilize inflation somewhat after years of hyperinflation.[^42] These pragmatic adjustments represented a significant shift from the strict economic controls that had characterized earlier years of his presidency.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Maduro's presidency has been engulfed by numerous serious controversies that have drawn widespread international condemnation. The most severe allegations concern systematic human rights violations committed by his government. A 2018 Amnesty International report accused Maduro's government of "committing some of the worst human rights violations in Venezuela's history," documenting patterns of arbitrary detention, torture, and suppression of dissent.[^44] More damning still, a 2020 United Nations mission concluded that human rights violations were "coordinated in accordance with state policies and part of a course of conduct that is both widespread and systematic, thus constituting crimes against humanity."[^45]

The International Criminal Court has opened an investigation into Maduro and senior officials for alleged crimes against humanity, examining evidence of systematic torture, sexual violence, and extrajudicial killings committed by Venezuelan security forces.[^46] Human rights organizations have documented nearly 900 political prisoners currently held in Venezuelan detention facilities, with credible reports of torture and inhumane treatment.[^47]

Venezuela's electoral integrity has been a source of persistent controversy throughout Maduro's tenure. The April 2013 election that brought him to power was contested by the opposition amid allegations of fraud, beginning a pattern that would continue.[^48] The 2018 presidential election, which Maduro claimed to win with more than two-thirds of votes cast, was widely rejected as fraudulent; the main opposition parties boycotted the election due to unfair conditions, and the result was not recognized by dozens of countries.[^49]

The July 2024 presidential election produced the most serious legitimacy crisis yet. After electoral authorities announced Maduro's victory, the opposition and independent observers raised serious concerns, noting that the electoral council refused to release precinct-level tally sheets to verify the results.[^50] The United Nations Panel of Electoral Experts and the Carter Center, which had monitored the election, raised serious concerns about its legitimacy.[^51] The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights stated it was "unable to recognize Nicolás Maduro's re-election as democratically legitimate due to the lack of electoral transparency and documented restrictions on political rights."[^52]

The violent response to post-election protests in 2024 further illustrated the government's repressive tactics. Authorities and pro-government armed groups known as colectivos responded to demonstrations with violence, resulting in 23 protesters and bystanders being killed and nearly 2,000 arrests, including minors and even young children.[^53] Maduro publicly bragged that more than 2,200 arrests had been made and announced that prisons would be repurposed to house political prisoners in facilities featuring "reeducation" and "hard labor" camps.[^54]

Venezuela's catastrophic economic and humanitarian crisis represents perhaps the most devastating aspect of Maduro's presidency. Under his leadership, Venezuela has experienced one of the worst economic collapses ever recorded in peacetime, with the economy contracting by approximately 72% and inflation reaching hyperinflationary levels that destroyed the value of the national currency.[^55] More than 20 million Venezuelans now live in multidimensional poverty, lacking adequate access to food, clean water, electricity, healthcare, and other essential services.[^56]

The crisis has triggered one of the largest displacement crises in the world. Since 2014, approximately 8 million Venezuelans—more than one-quarter of the country's population—have fled the country, creating refugee and migration challenges throughout Latin America and beyond.[^57] Analysts attribute Venezuela's decline to both Chávez's and Maduro's economic policies, including expropriation of private businesses, price controls, currency manipulation, corruption, and mismanagement of the state oil company PDVSA.[^58]

Maduro's government has faced serious allegations of involvement in drug trafficking and organized crime. In October 2020, the United States Department of Justice indicted Maduro on charges of narcoterrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States, with the U.S. government eventually offering a $50 million reward for information leading to his arrest.[^59] The "Narcosobrinos" affair, in which two nephews of Maduro's wife Cilia Flores were convicted in U.S. federal court in November 2016 of attempting to smuggle drugs into the United States, further tarnished the government's reputation.[^60]

International isolation has intensified as Maduro's governance has deteriorated. Since 2019, more than 50 countries, including the United States and most European and Latin American nations, have refused to recognize Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate president.[^61] Many recognized opposition leader Juan Guaidó as interim president following Maduro's contested 2019 inauguration, though Guaidó's movement eventually lost momentum.[^62]

Maduro's government has been accused of authoritarian practices including shutting down independent media, imprisoning opposition leaders, banning opposition candidates from running for office, and using the judiciary as a political weapon to persecute critics.[^63] The Safe Homeland program that Maduro launched to reduce crime actually coincided with murder rates increasing to 82 per 100,000 people by 2014, making Venezuela one of the world's most violent countries.[^64]

## Personal Life

Nicolás Maduro married Cilia Adela Flores de Maduro in July 2013, shortly after becoming president, though their relationship had developed years earlier.[^65] The couple first met in 1992 when Cilia Flores, a lawyer and politician, was providing legal representation to Hugo Chávez after his failed coup attempt.[^66] Flores played a crucial role in securing Chávez's release from prison in 1994, and through this work, she and Maduro, both committed Chávez supporters, developed a close relationship.[^67]

Born on October 15, 1956, Cilia Flores is six years older than Maduro and has been described as one of the most powerful figures in Venezuelan politics, with some observers comparing her influence to that of Claire Underwood from the television series "House of Cards."[^68] Before marrying Maduro, Flores had an impressive political career of her own. She served as the first female President of the National Assembly from 2006 to 2011, taking over the position when Maduro was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs.[^69] She also served as Attorney General of Venezuela from 2012 until Maduro's election.[^70]

As First Lady, Flores has been given the title "First Combatant" and maintains significant political influence, reportedly advising Maduro on key decisions and maintaining her own power base within the government and military.[^71] Some analysts suggest that her legal acumen and political experience have been crucial in helping Maduro navigate complex political challenges and maintain power despite his lack of Chávez's charisma.[^72]

However, Flores's family has been the source of significant controversy for the couple. In November 2016, her two nephews, Efraín Antonio Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were convicted in a U.S. federal court of conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States.[^73] The prosecution argued that the nephews sought "to obtain a large amount of cash to help their family stay in power" in Venezuela.[^74] This scandal, known as the "Narcosobrinos" affair, was deeply embarrassing for Maduro's government and contributed to allegations of high-level involvement in drug trafficking.[^75]

Maduro himself comes from a family of four children and was the only son among his siblings.[^76] His upbringing in a working-class neighborhood and his experience as a bus driver remain central to his public persona and political identity. He frequently references his humble origins and working-class background in speeches, positioning himself as a man of the people in contrast to opposition figures whom he portrays as representing elite interests.[^77]

Throughout his presidency, Maduro has cultivated an image of unwavering devotion to Hugo Chávez's memory and legacy. He has made numerous statements about feeling Chávez's spiritual presence and has claimed to sleep on Chávez's tomb for inspiration—statements that critics have mocked but that appear designed to maintain his connection to Chávez's still-popular legacy among some sectors of Venezuelan society.[^78] Maduro has described himself as "an apostle of Chávez" and "the son of Chávez," repeatedly emphasizing his role as the continuation of the Bolivarian Revolution rather than as an independent leader.[^79]

Unlike Chávez, who was known for his charisma, long speeches, and ability to connect with crowds, Maduro is generally perceived as lacking his predecessor's personal magnetism.[^80] This has been noted by numerous observers as one of the key challenges of his presidency—he inherited Chávez's political structure and coalition but not the personal qualities that had sustained them.[^81] Maduro's speaking style has been the subject of commentary, with his statements sometimes characterized as verbal gaffes or "Maduradas."[^82]

## Legacy

Nicolás Maduro's legacy is still being written as he remains in power, but the contours of how he will be remembered are becoming increasingly clear. His presidency represents one of the most dramatic national collapses in modern history, with Venezuela transforming from Latin America's wealthiest nation during the oil boom to a country experiencing humanitarian catastrophe, mass emigration, and international pariah status.[^83]

The economic devastation that occurred under Maduro's watch will likely define his legacy above all else. The 72% economic contraction, hyperinflation that destroyed the currency, and the exodus of more than 8 million Venezuelans constitute one of the worst peacetime economic collapses ever recorded.[^84] The transformation of a country that once had the highest standard of living in South America into one where millions struggle to access food, medicine, clean water, and electricity represents a staggering reversal of fortune that will shape Venezuela for generations.[^85]

Maduro's political legacy is equally problematic. He inherited a semi-authoritarian system from Chávez and, according to numerous scholars and international observers, transformed it into a fully authoritarian regime.[^86] The systematic dismantling of democratic institutions, manipulation of elections, imprisonment of political opponents, and violent suppression of dissent have fundamentally altered Venezuela's political landscape.[^87] The findings by the United Nations that his government committed crimes against humanity place him among the world's most repressive leaders.[^88]

His foreign policy legacy is characterized by Venezuela's increasing isolation from the Western hemisphere and deepening dependence on authoritarian allies. Maduro's alignment with Russia, China, Iran, and other autocratic regimes has reoriented Venezuela's international position and made the country a focal point of geopolitical competition in Latin America.[^89] His government has become a source of regional instability, with Venezuelan migrants and refugees creating challenges for neighboring countries and criminal networks operating across borders.[^90]

The collapse of Chavismo as a political movement may be part of Maduro's legacy. While Chávez built a genuinely popular movement that won repeated electoral victories, Maduro has presided over its transformation into what scholars describe as "populism without popularity"—a government that maintains power through coercion and external support rather than genuine popular mandate.[^91] The contested elections, particularly in 2024, have demonstrated that Maduro can only claim victory through electoral manipulation rather than authentic democratic support.[^92]

Yet Maduro's most remarkable achievement may be his sheer survival. Despite facing coup attempts, assassination attempts (including the 2018 drone attack), crippling international sanctions, diplomatic isolation, defection of some military and government officials, massive protests, and the recognition of an alternative president by dozens of countries, Maduro has remained in power.[^93] This resilience, while demonstrating his political cunning and the strength of the security apparatus he controls, also reflects the support he has received from powerful international backers and his willingness to employ increasingly repressive measures.[^94]

The humanitarian cost of Maduro's presidency will be remembered for decades. The degradation of Venezuela's once-excellent healthcare system, the malnutrition affecting large portions of the population, the breakdown of basic services, and the desperation that drove millions to flee their homeland represent a human tragedy of immense proportions.[^95] The brain drain and loss of professional and skilled workers who fled the country will impact Venezuela's development potential for years to come.[^96]

For some supporters, particularly among Venezuela's remaining Chavista base and among leftist movements internationally, Maduro represents resistance to U.S. imperialism and defense of sovereignty in the face of economic warfare through sanctions.[^97] This narrative portrays him as a leader besieged by external enemies who seek to overthrow him and seize Venezuela's oil wealth.[^98] However, this perspective has diminished even among the Latin American left, with many former allies distancing themselves from Maduro's government.[^99]

Ultimately, Maduro's legacy appears to be that of a leader who lacked the charisma, competence, and legitimacy of his predecessor but inherited a political system that allowed him to cling to power even as the country collapsed around him. Whether history remembers him as an authoritarian dictator who destroyed Venezuela's democracy and economy, or whether alternative narratives about external pressure and economic warfare gain purchase, will depend partly on Venezuela's eventual political evolution and who gets to write its history.[^100]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Nicolás Maduro argue that his presidency must be understood in the context of an unprecedented economic war waged against Venezuela by the United States and Western powers. This perspective, articulated by leftist scholars and allied governments, maintains that U.S. sanctions have been the primary cause of Venezuela's economic collapse, deliberately designed to create suffering that would turn the population against Maduro and the Bolivarian Revolution.[^101] According to this view, Maduro has demonstrated remarkable resilience in defending Venezuelan sovereignty against imperialist aggression and attempted regime change.[^102]

Academic supporters within the framework of dependency theory and anti-imperialist analysis argue that Maduro's foreign policy has successfully challenged U.S. hegemony in Latin America and contributed to the creation of a multipolar world order.[^103] His strengthening of ties with Russia, China, Iran, and other countries opposed to Western dominance is seen as strategic resistance to unilateral power structures that have historically exploited Latin American nations.[^104] Some scholars sympathetic to this position argue that Venezuela's provision of subsidized oil to Caribbean nations and support for leftist movements throughout the region represents genuine solidarity and anti-imperialist internationalism.[^105]

Defenders point to Maduro's continuation of social programs aimed at helping Venezuela's poor, arguing that despite economic challenges, the government has maintained its commitment to the working class and marginalized communities.[^106] They emphasize that housing programs, food subsidies, and healthcare initiatives demonstrate the government's priorities, even amid severe economic constraints imposed by external forces.[^107] From this perspective, Maduro represents the continuation of Chávez's revolutionary project and its commitment to social justice and wealth redistribution.[^108]

Some analysts sympathetic to Maduro's position argue that electoral controversies have been exaggerated by opposition forces backed by foreign powers, and that Venezuela's electoral system has been certified as secure by international observers in previous elections.[^109] They contend that opposition claims of fraud are politically motivated attempts to delegitimize a government they cannot defeat through democratic means.[^110]

A narrative promoted by Venezuelan government officials and some allied scholars frames Maduro as a working-class leader who rose from humble origins to defend the interests of ordinary people against oligarchic elites.[^111] His background as a bus driver and union organizer is emphasized as evidence of his authentic connection to the Venezuelan working class, in contrast to opposition leaders portrayed as representing privileged sectors seeking to restore elite rule.[^112]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus among international observers, scholars, human rights organizations, and democratic governments is profoundly critical of Maduro's presidency. Academic research has characterized his government as authoritarian, with scholars documenting the systematic dismantling of democratic institutions, manipulation of electoral processes, and elimination of checks and balances.[^113] Political scientists specializing in authoritarianism have identified Venezuela under Maduro as a clear case of democratic backsliding and authoritarian consolidation.[^114]

Economic experts across the ideological spectrum have condemned Maduro's economic management as catastrophically incompetent. Economists point to policy choices including price controls, currency manipulation, expropriation of productive enterprises, and massive corruption as primary causes of Venezuela's economic collapse, while acknowledging that sanctions exacerbated but did not create the crisis.[^115] Multiple studies have documented that Venezuela's economic decline began before major sanctions were imposed, undermining arguments that external pressure alone explains the country's collapse.[^116]

The United Nations and international human rights organizations have provided extensive documentation of systematic human rights abuses under Maduro's government. The UN mission's determination that Venezuela has committed crimes against humanity represents one of the most serious international legal condemnations possible.[^117] Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and other respected organizations have compiled extensive evidence of torture, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, and persecution of political opponents.[^118]

Scholarly analysis of Maduro's electoral claims has found substantial evidence of fraud and manipulation. Research by electoral experts examining the 2024 election found that the government's refusal to release precinct-level results, combined with opposition evidence showing a different outcome, strongly suggests electoral fraud.[^119] Academic studies have documented how Maduro's government has systematically undermined electoral integrity through manipulation of voter registries, abuse of state resources, intimidation of opponents, and control of electoral authorities.[^120]

Regional specialists emphasize Venezuela's transformation into a source of instability for Latin America. The refugee crisis has created humanitarian and economic challenges for neighboring countries, while criminal networks including drug trafficking organizations, illegal armed groups, and corrupt officials have operated with impunity, spreading insecurity across borders.[^121] Scholars of Latin American politics note that Venezuela's collapse has reversed decades of regional development progress and created security challenges that will persist for years.[^122]

Experts on authoritarianism and populism have characterized Maduro as representing "populism without popularity"—a leader who maintains the rhetoric and structures of a populist movement while lacking genuine popular support and relying instead on coercion, external backing, and institutional manipulation.[^123] This analysis emphasizes that unlike Chávez, who won legitimate electoral victories based on real popular support, Maduro can only claim power through increasingly authoritarian means.[^124]

International relations scholars have criticized Maduro's foreign policy as subordinating Venezuela's interests to those of authoritarian great powers, particularly Russia and China, who have provided financial support in exchange for access to Venezuelan resources and geopolitical influence in the Western hemisphere.[^125] Rather than representing genuine multipolarity, critics argue, Maduro has simply exchanged one form of dependence for another while aligning Venezuela with some of the world's most repressive regimes.[^126]

The scholarly consensus, reflected in publications from major academic presses, peer-reviewed journals, and reports from respected think tanks, is that Maduro's presidency represents an authoritarian disaster that has inflicted immense suffering on the Venezuelan people while degrading democracy, human rights, and economic welfare in service of maintaining personal power.[^127]
