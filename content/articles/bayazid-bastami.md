## Summary

Bayazid Bastami (Abu Yazid al-Bistami) was a Persian Sufi master who pioneered the 'intoxicated' or ecstatic school of Sufism. He is famous for his ecstatic utterances (shathiyyat), including 'Glory to me! How great is my majesty!' (Subhani), expressing the annihilation of self in God. He introduced Buddhist-influenced concepts of selflessness into Sufism. He is considered the founder of the ecstatic tradition that led to Al-Hallaj and later Sufi poets.
