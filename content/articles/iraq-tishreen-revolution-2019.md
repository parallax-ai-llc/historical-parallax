## Summary

On October 1, 2019, Iraqis took to the streets in the largest and most sustained protests since the 2003 US invasion—and the bloodiest. The Tishreen ("October") Revolution erupted over unemployment, corruption, and a political system designed by sect rather than merit. But this was more than economic grievance: protesters rejected the entire post-2003 order, including Iranian influence and the militias that enforced it. "We want a homeland" (نريد وطن) became their cry.[^1]

The government's response was lethal. Security forces and Iran-aligned militias used live ammunition, tear gas canisters fired directly at heads, and snipers targeting protesters. Over 600 were killed in the first six months; more than 20,000 were injured. The massacre forced Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi's resignation, but the killing continued. Iranian General Qasem Soleimani personally advised the crackdown before his own assassination in January 2020.[^2]

The Tishreen Revolution achieved Abdul-Mahdi's fall and early elections—but the activists who survived face ongoing assassinations by militias. The sectarian system (muhasasa) remains. The protesters, disproportionately young, Shia, and from the south, were killed by forces claiming to represent their own community. That paradox defines Iraq's tragedy: a population trapped between its government and the militias supposedly protecting it.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Post-2003 Iraq

After the US invasion toppled Saddam Hussein:
- **Muhasasa:** Sectarian power-sharing system—positions divided by sect/ethnicity
- **Corruption:** Endemic; trillions in oil revenue disappeared
- **Services:** Electricity, water, infrastructure failed despite wealth
- **Militias:** Iranian-aligned groups (Popular Mobilization Forces/PMF) grew powerful
- **ISIS:** 2014-2017 war devastated the country

By 2019, youth unemployment exceeded 25%; overall, 40% of Iraqis lived near poverty.[^4]

### Iranian Influence

Iran's role in Iraq grew after 2003:
- Trained Shia militias
- PMF (Hashd al-Shaabi) integrated into security forces
- Political parties aligned with Tehran
- Qasem Soleimani (Quds Force) operated openly

For many Iraqis, especially young Shia, Iranian influence became as resented as any occupation.[^5]

## The Revolution

### October 1-6, 2019: The Spark

The protests began spontaneously:
- No single trigger—accumulated grievances
- Young people gathered in Baghdad's Tahrir Square
- Spread rapidly to southern cities: Basra, Nasiriyah, Karbala, Najaf

**Initial days:** Security forces killed dozens; internet cut off.[^6]

### Tahrir Square

Baghdad's Tahrir (Liberation) Square became the revolution's heart:
- Thousands camped; occupied the Turkish Restaurant building overlooking the square
- Self-organized; medical stations, libraries, art
- Cross-sectarian—though predominantly Shia southern Iraq
- Women participated despite conservative pressures

Slogans:
- "نريد وطن" (We want a homeland)
- "An Iraqi revolution—not Eastern or Western"
- Rejection of all parties—including those claiming to represent Shia[^7]

### Escalation (October-December 2019)

**October 25:** Second wave of protests after internet restored
**November:** Protesters attacked Iranian consulates in Karbala and Najaf
**November 28:** Pro-Iranian militias attacked Nasiriyah protesters—dozens killed
**December 6:** Massacre near Tahrir Square—29-80 killed by unidentified gunmen[^8]

### Abdul-Mahdi's Resignation

**November 29, 2019:** Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi resigned under pressure

But forming a new government took months; violence continued.[^9]

---

## Death Toll

**By March 2020:**
- 600+ killed (some estimates: nearly 700)
- 20,000+ injured
- 2,800+ arrested

**Tactics used against protesters:**
- Live ammunition
- Tear gas canisters fired directly at heads/chests (causing skull fractures, death)
- Snipers on rooftops
- Stun grenades, hot pepper gas

**Who was responsible:**
- Iraqi security forces
- Iran-aligned PMF militias (Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, Kata'ib Hezbollah, others)
- "Third party" snipers—never officially identified[^10]

---

## Iranian Role

**Qasem Soleimani:**
- Flew to Baghdad during protests
- Chaired security meetings
- Advised aggressive crackdown
- Assassinated by US drone strike January 3, 2020

**Militia snipers:**
- Reports indicated Iran-backed militants deployed snipers
- "Unit 400" (Quds Force) allegedly involved
- Protester attacks on Iranian consulates showed depth of anti-Tehran sentiment[^11]

## Key Figures

### Protest Movement

| Name/Group | Role |
|------------|------|
| Leaderless movement | Deliberately decentralized |
| Tahrir Square community | Self-organized administration |
| Women activists | Prominent despite threats |

### Government/Militias

| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| Adil Abdul-Mahdi | Prime Minister; resigned November 2019 |
| Mustafa al-Kadhimi | Successor PM (May 2020); promised accountability |
| Qasem Soleimani | IRGC Quds Force; advised crackdown |
| Muqtada al-Sadr | Initially supportive; later ambiguous |

### The Sadrist Factor

Muqtada al-Sadr's movement:
- Initially joined protests; "Blue Berets" provided protection
- February 2020: Sadr withdrew support; his followers attacked protesters
- Sadrists viewed as opportunistic by many activists[^12]

## Historical Assessment

### Movement Perspective

**Historic Rupture:** Tishreen represented the first mass rejection of the post-2003 order by the community supposedly benefiting from it—Shia Iraqis. Young protesters from Basra and Nasiriyah were killed by militias claiming to represent Shia interests. This exposed the gap between the political class and the people.[^13]

**Anti-Sectarianism:** The slogan "We want a homeland" rejected the assumption that Iraqis should be defined by sect. Protesters demanded services, jobs, and governance—not sectarian quotas.

### Regime/Militia Perspective

**Official Narrative:** Some officials blamed "infiltrators" or foreign agents. Iran and allied media portrayed the protests as a US-Israel plot. Militias claimed to protect Iraq from destabilization.

### Critical Analysis

**Structural Violence:** The muhasasa system's beneficiaries—political parties associated with sects—have no incentive to reform. They control oil revenue, patronage networks, and armed forces. Removing one prime minister changed nothing structural.

**Assassination Campaign:** Since 2019, at least 34 prominent activists have been assassinated in targeted killings. No one has been held accountable. This terror is meant to silence survivors.[^14]

## Aftermath

### Mustafa al-Kadhimi

May 2020: Al-Kadhimi became PM
- Former intelligence chief; promised reform
- Arrested some militia figures briefly
- Could not overcome structural constraints
- Replaced by Mohammed Shia al-Sudani (2022)

### 2021 Elections

- Early elections held October 2021
- Sadr's party won most seats; later withdrew
- Militia-aligned parties remained powerful
- Turnout low (41%)—reflecting disillusionment

### Ongoing Assassinations

Activists continue to be killed:
- Hisham al-Hashimi (researcher, July 2020)
- Ihab al-Wazni (activist, May 2021)
- Dozens more—no accountability[^15]
