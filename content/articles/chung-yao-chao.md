## Summary

Chung-Yao Chao (Zhao Zhongyao) was one of the first physicists to observe evidence of the positron and electron-positron pair production in 1930, before Carl Anderson's credited discovery. His experiments at Caltech detected anomalous radiation from lead, which was later understood as positron annihilation. He later helped establish China's nuclear physics program.
