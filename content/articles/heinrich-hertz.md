## Summary

Heinrich Hertz was a German physicist who conclusively proved the existence of electromagnetic waves predicted by Maxwell's equations. His experiments between 1886 and 1889 demonstrated that electromagnetic waves could be generated, transmitted, and received, laying the groundwork for radio communication. The unit of frequency (hertz, Hz) is named in his honor. He died of Wegener's granulomatosis at just 36.
