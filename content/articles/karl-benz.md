## Summary

Karl Benz was a German engine designer and automobile engineer who created the first true automobile powered by an internal combustion engine: the Benz Patent-Motorwagen in 1885. He received the first patent for a gasoline-powered car. His wife Bertha Benz's famous 1888 long-distance drive proved the automobile's practicality. Benz's company later merged with Daimler to form Mercedes-Benz.
