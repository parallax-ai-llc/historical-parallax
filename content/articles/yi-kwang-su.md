## Summary

Yi Kwang-su (1892–1950), also known by his pen names Chunwon and Goju, was Korea's most distinguished modern novelist and one of the most controversial figures in Korean literary and political history.[^1] Best known for his novel *Mujeong* (The Heartless), sometimes described as the first modern Korean novel, Yi was simultaneously a pioneering literary modernizer, nationalist independence activist, and later a notorious collaborator with Imperial Japan.[^2] His dramatic transformation from lead author of the February 8 Declaration of Independence to head of the pro-Japanese Korean Writers Association represents one of the most painful betrayals in Korean history.[^3] Yi's legacy remains deeply contested, as scholars continue to grapple with how to assess a figure who made foundational contributions to Korean literature while also enthusiastically supporting Japanese colonial rule.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Yi Kwang-su was born Yi Bogyeong on February 1, 1892, in Jeongju (present-day North Pyongan Province), into a poor yangban (upper class) family.[^5] His early childhood was marked by tragedy when, in 1902, both of his parents died of cholera, leaving him orphaned at the age of ten.[^6] This traumatic loss would profoundly shape Yi's worldview and his later preoccupation with themes of suffering, modernization, and national renewal in his literary works.

Following his parents' death, Yi was raised among Donghak believers, a peasant religious movement that had led a major uprising against the Joseon Dynasty and foreign influence.[^7] In 1904, around the time of the Donghak Peasant Revolution's aftermath, Yi moved to Seoul to avoid the authorities, demonstrating the turbulent political environment of his youth.[^8] Despite his impoverished circumstances, Yi managed to enroll at a seodang (traditional school) in 1899, receiving a classical Confucian education.[^9]

Yi's life trajectory changed dramatically in August 1905 when he received a scholarship from the Iljinhoe organization to study abroad in Japan.[^10] In March 1906, at age fourteen, he enrolled in Taisei Middle School in Japan, beginning an education that would expose him to Western thought, Japanese modernization, and new literary movements.[^11] Yi had two younger sisters, Yi Aegyŏng and Yi Aeran, who remained in Korea.[^12]

Through the generosity of anonymous benefactors and scholarships, Yi continued his Japanese education, eventually attending Meiji Gakuin and later enrolling in the liberal arts division of Waseda University in September 1915.[^13] Financial support came from various sources, including Chungang High School, where An Chae-hong was dean, and from educator and entrepreneur Kim Song-su.[^14] However, Yi dropped out of Waseda in his third year, never completing his degree.[^15] Between his periods of study in Japan, Yi returned to Korea in 1913 to teach at Osan School in Jeongju, where he began to develop his educational philosophy and nationalist convictions.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

Yi Kwang-su's rise to literary prominence began remarkably early. In late 1909, while still a student, he published his first work of literature, a Japanese-language short story entitled "Ai ka" (愛か, "Is It Love?"), in Meiji Gakuin's school newsletter, Shirogane gakuhō.[^17] This early work demonstrated Yi's facility with Japanese language and literature, which would later become a source of controversy during his collaboration period.

Yi's transformation into a major literary figure occurred with the serialization of *Mujeong* (The Heartless) beginning in 1917.[^18] When the novel appeared, it was an immediate sensation, and nearly overnight made Yi Kwang-su Korea's most admired novelist.[^19] *The Heartless* is often described as Korea's first mature modern novel, occupying a place in Korean literature comparable to Natsume Soseki's *Kokoro* (1914) in Japanese literature or Lu Xun's *The True Story of Ah Q* (1922) in Chinese literature.[^20] The novel addressed the crossroads at which Korea found itself, stranded between tradition and modernity, undergoing conflict between social realities and traditional ideals.[^21]

Beyond fiction, Yi established himself as a major intellectual figure through his essays and theoretical writings. In November 1916, he published "What Is Literature," considered the first modern work of literary theory in Korea, establishing foundational principles for Korean literary criticism.[^22] His essays originally focused on the need for national consciousness, and he became known as "a man of letters more than a writer of fiction, probably the most distinguished, if controversial, Korean man of letters from the mid-1910s through the 1930s."[^23]

Yi's political awakening reached its zenith in January 1919 when he joined the Korean Young People's Independence Organization (조선청년독립단; 朝鮮靑年獨立團) and served as the lead author of the February 8 Declaration of Independence.[^24] The declaration, drafted while Yi was a student at Tokyo's Waseda University, was announced on February 8, 1919, and served as a catalyst for the nationwide March First Movement protests in Korea that same month.[^25] The document was also instrumental in establishing the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai, China, in April 1919.[^26]

A few days before the declaration was announced, Yi left Japan via Kobe and traveled to Shanghai, where he settled into the French Concession and joined the Korean Provisional Government (KPG).[^27] He eventually became editor-in-chief of the organization's official newspaper, *Tongnip sinmun* (The Independent), using journalism to advance the cause of Korean independence.[^28] This period represented the apex of Yi's nationalist credentials and his reputation as a patriotic intellectual committed to Korean liberation.

## Major Achievements

Yi Kwang-su's literary achievements fundamentally transformed Korean literature and established many of the conventions of modern Korean fiction. His 1917 novel *The Heartless* holds a central position in the Korean literary canon and is widely taught in Korean schools and universities.[^29] The novel's immediate popularity and lasting influence stem from its innovative use of the Korean vernacular, psychological realism, and engagement with contemporary social issues including education, gender relations, and national identity.[^30]

*The Heartless* articulated an educational philosophy that resonated with Korean reformers. A character in the novel expresses Yi's vision: "So that we can acquire strength, knowledge and civilisation, and bring them back with us. So that we can establish a solid foundation for the people's livelihood, based on modern civilisation."[^31] This emphasis on education, modernization, and civilization as paths to national strengthening became central themes throughout Yi's early career.

Yi's 500-page epic novel *The Soil* (흙, *Heuk*), serialized in the *Dong-a Ilbo* from April 12, 1932, through July 10, 1933, represented another major achievement.[^32] The novel is considered an elemental part of the canon of modern Korean literature and inspired an entire social movement called "the enlightenment of farmers."[^33] Through *The Soil*, Yi advocated for rural reconstruction, agricultural improvement, and the moral transformation of Korean peasants, reflecting his evolving nationalist philosophy.

Beyond his novels, Yi produced an enormous body of work that shaped Korean intellectual discourse. During his most productive years, he "not only produced a stream of full-length novels and short stories but also a large number of newspaper columns and powerfully argued provocative essays on some of the most critical issues of his time."[^34] His essays addressed fundamental questions of Korean identity, modernization, and national character.

Yi's 1915-1918 years at Waseda University were especially important, as the books he read there became the underpinnings of his key intellectual ideas of "preparatism" and gradualism.[^35] These concepts emphasized that Korea needed to prepare itself morally and culturally before it could achieve true independence. From the early 1920s to the 1930s, Yi transformed into a dedicated nationalist and published his controversial essay "Minjok gaejoron" (민족 개조론, "On the Remaking of National Consciousness"), which advocated a moral overhaul of Korea.[^36] While controversial, this essay influenced Korean intellectual discourse by shifting focus toward internal cultural reform rather than solely blaming external forces for Korea's subjugation.

Yi was also a pioneer in personal and social reform. He was one of the first Koreans to divorce and remarry for love rather than following traditional arranged marriage customs, making him "a bit of a cause celebre in his personal life."[^37] This willingness to challenge traditional norms in his personal life paralleled his literary efforts to modernize Korean society and culture.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Yi Kwang-su's collaboration with Imperial Japan during the 1930s and 1940s represents one of the most controversial and condemned aspects of Korean modern history. His transformation from nationalist hero to Japanese collaborator was so shocking that literary scholar Gim Hyeon argues Yi is like "a wound that becomes more painful the more one touches it."[^38] As the literary historian notes, Yi was "a prominent nationalist centrally involved in constructing Korean national identity, making his collaboration so shocking a betrayal that it was traumatic."[^39]

Yi's turn toward collaboration began after his imprisonment in 1937 due to involvement in the Self-Cultivation Friendship Association incident.[^40] After being released half a year later due to illness, he recanted his anti-Japanese stance and increasingly leaned toward collaboration with the colonial authorities.[^41] By 1939, Yi became the first head of the pro-Japanese Korean Writers Association (朝鮮文人協會/조선문인협회) and led intense efforts to Japanize (hwangminhwa) Korea.[^42]

Perhaps most symbolically damaging to his legacy, Yi eagerly adopted the Japanese name Kayama Mitsurou (香山光郎) as soon as the Sōshi-kaimei policy came into effect.[^43] The Sōshi-kaimei policy was a Japanese colonial measure that encouraged or forced Koreans to adopt Japanese-style names, and Yi's enthusiastic adoption of a Japanese name demonstrated his willing participation in cultural erasure.[^44] By 1940, Yi had become "a pretty raving apologist for the Japanese colonial project."[^45]

After Korea's liberation in 1945, Yi fled to the countryside, aware that he would face consequences for his collaboration.[^46] In 1949, he was arrested for collaboration, and the Special Committee for the Investigation of Anti-nationalist Activities found Yi guilty.[^47] The verdict confirmed what many Koreans already believed: that Yi had betrayed his nation and his earlier ideals. Despite his foundational importance to Korean literature, Yi has not been featured on Korean currency due to his pro-Japanese activities.[^48]

Even before his collaboration period, Yi faced criticism for his controversial essay "Minjok gaejoron" (On the Remaking of National Consciousness), which "blamed Koreans for being defeatist" rather than focusing solely on Japanese oppression.[^49] This tendency to critique Korean culture and character led some contemporaries to view Yi as overly harsh toward his own people. His abandonment of fellow writer Kim Myeong-sun "allegedly because his own beliefs about modernism had shifted" also demonstrated a pattern of prioritizing ideological consistency over personal loyalty.[^50]

Yi's collaboration raises profound moral and philosophical questions that continue to trouble Korean historiography. As one scholar notes, recent scholarship has attempted "to return to the basic question of why Korean intellectuals collaborated with the Japanese empire" rather than simply condemning them.[^51] Yi's case is particularly difficult because unlike some collaborators who can be explained by opportunism or coercion, Yi appears to have genuinely believed in his later positions, making his betrayal both more complete and more philosophically complex.

## Personal Life

Yi Kwang-su's personal life was marked by unconventional choices that reflected his modernist sensibilities and willingness to break with tradition. He married for the first time in July 1910 at age 18, in what was possibly an arranged marriage to Paek Hyesun.[^52] However, this marriage would not last. After returning to Japan in 1915 and falling ill in 1918, Yi fell in love with the woman who nursed him back to health, Hŏ Yŏngsuk.[^53] He divorced his first wife in 1918 and married Hŏ in 1921, becoming one of the first Koreans to divorce and remarry for love.[^54]

This decision to divorce and remarry based on romantic love rather than family obligation made Yi "a bit of a cause celebre in his personal life" and demonstrated his commitment to modernizing Korean social customs.[^55] His personal choices paralleled themes in his fiction, particularly *The Heartless*, which explored tensions between traditional arranged marriages and modern romantic love.

Yi and Hŏ Yŏngsuk had five children together: three sons—Lee Chinkŭn, Lee Ponggŭn, and Lee Yŏnggŭn—and two daughters, Chung-Nan Lee Kim and Chung-Wha Lee Iyengar.[^56] His family life, however, faced extraordinary pressures due to his collaboration with Japan. In 1946, after Korea's liberation, Yi even had to divorce his wife in order to save the family's property from possible confiscation, as he was despised and ostracized for his collaboration with Japanese authorities.[^57] This forced divorce to protect family assets illustrated the severe social and legal consequences Yi faced for his wartime activities.

Yi's personality and beliefs evolved significantly throughout his life. The third period of his career, from the 1930s onward, coincided with Yi's conversion to Buddhism, and his work consequently became noticeably Buddhist in tone.[^58] Yi entered Waseda University's department of philosophy in 1917, which provided him with philosophical training that influenced his intellectual development.[^59] His conversion to Buddhism represented a significant philosophical and religious shift that influenced his writing during the final phase of his career, adding spiritual and contemplative dimensions to his later works.

Yi maintained complex professional relationships with other Korean intellectuals and writers. His willingness to abandon friendships based on ideological shifts, as demonstrated in his treatment of Kim Myeong-sun, suggests a personality that prioritized intellectual consistency and evolving beliefs over personal loyalty.[^60] This trait may help explain how Yi could transition from passionate nationalist to Japanese collaborator—he appears to have been someone who fully committed to each successive worldview he adopted, regardless of how dramatically it contradicted his previous positions.

## Legacy

Yi Kwang-su's legacy remains one of the most contested and painful in Korean cultural history. Despite his collaboration, his foundational role in creating modern Korean literature cannot be erased. *The Heartless* continues to occupy "a prominent place in the Korean literary canon" and is recognized as Korea's first mature modern novel.[^61] His technical innovations in using vernacular Korean, psychological characterization, and engagement with contemporary social issues established templates that subsequent Korean writers would follow.

Yi's 1916 essay "What Is Literature" established foundational principles for Korean literary criticism and helped create the theoretical framework for understanding and analyzing modern Korean literature.[^62] His novel *The Soil* inspired the "enlightenment of farmers" movement, demonstrating how literature could directly influence social movements and rural development efforts.[^63] These achievements represent lasting contributions to Korean culture that persist independently of Yi's later betrayal.

However, the trauma of Yi's collaboration has profoundly shaped how Koreans remember and assess the colonial period. As one scholar notes, "the cloak of silence surrounding collaboration in South Korea was lifted in the 1980s as part of the wider political struggle for democratization."[^64] During the Cold War under military dictatorship, when many South Korean political and military elites were former collaborators, the term "collaborator" (ch'inilp'a) often functioned as a prohibition, indicating that a person or certain texts were not worthy of serious scholarly attention.[^65]

Yi's case became central to broader debates about collaboration precisely because his earlier nationalist credentials were so impeccable. The author of the February 8 Declaration of Independence and editor-in-chief of the Provisional Government's newspaper transforming into the head of the pro-Japanese Korean Writers Association represented a complete moral inversion.[^66] This dramatic betrayal forced Koreans to confront uncomfortable questions about the nature of collaboration, the pressures of colonial rule, and the reliability of nationalist intellectuals.

Yi's final days added another tragic dimension to his legacy. In 1950, when North Korean forces were withdrawing from Seoul in September, they rounded up people of political and cultural significance and sent them to the North.[^67] Yi Kwang-su was captured by the North Korean army, and the march to the Chinese border under the watchful eyes of guards proved too demanding for the aging writer.[^68] He was last seen in a Pyongyang prison in October 1950, and died in Manpo on October 25, most likely of tuberculosis.[^69] Thus, Yi died a prisoner of the very communist North Korean regime that considered him a collaborator and traitor—a final irony in a life full of contradictions.

The evolution of scholarly treatment of Yi demonstrates changing attitudes toward collaboration. Research on collaboration became active only after the victory of the democracy movement and the end of the Cold War.[^70] Recent scholarship has moved beyond simple nationalist denunciations and, influenced by cultural studies, has attempted to reconceptualize collaboration in ways that can produce new readings of the colonial period.[^71] Some contemporary scholars conceive of collaboration as "a structural feature of modernity" and situate the issue in a broader, more international context.[^72]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite Yi Kwang-su's collaboration, many scholars recognize his indisputable contributions to Korean literature and intellectual life. Yi Kwangsu's *The Heartless* (Mujŏng, 1917) is acknowledged as "Korea's first mature novel and its most celebrated text, on par with Natsume Soseki's *Kokoro* (1914) and Lu Xun's *The True Story of Ah Q* (1922)."[^73] This comparison places Yi's work within the broader context of East Asian literary modernization, recognizing his achievement as parallel to the canonical founding texts of modern Japanese and Chinese literature.

Scholars who study Yi's early period emphasize his pioneering role in multiple domains. As one assessment notes, Yi "had been a man of letters more than a writer of fiction, probably the most distinguished, if controversial, Korean man of letters from the mid-1910s through the 1930s."[^74] His 1916 essay "What Is Literature" established Korean literary criticism as a modern discipline, providing theoretical frameworks that subsequent generations of critics would build upon.[^75]

Academic work on Yi's literary technique and innovations continues to produce important scholarship. Research examines how "Yi Kwang-su was one of the pioneers of modern Korean literature" who transformed Korean fiction through vernacular language, psychological realism, and engagement with contemporary social issues.[^76] His novel *The Soil* is recognized as "an elemental part of the canon of modern Korean literature" that inspired real-world social movements for rural improvement.[^77]

Some scholars attempt to understand Yi's collaboration within broader historical and philosophical contexts rather than simply condemning it. These approaches examine how "recent scholarship conceives of collaboration as 'a structural feature of modernity' and situates the issue in a broader, more international context."[^78] This historiographical shift allows for more nuanced examination of the pressures, ideologies, and circumstances that led intellectuals to collaborate, though it remains deeply controversial among Korean audiences.

Defenders of studying Yi's work, even while acknowledging his collaboration, argue that his literary legacy should be preserved and analyzed. They note that "Yi Kwangsu's place in world literary studies has often been obscured by the author's later collaboration with the colonial state," suggesting that his collaboration, while historically significant, should not completely overshadow his literary achievements.[^79] This position remains minority within Korean discourse but has some support in international scholarly communities.

### Negative Views

The condemnation of Yi Kwang-su's collaboration remains intense and widespread in Korean society. As literary scholar Gim Hyeon powerfully states, Yi is like "a wound that becomes more painful the more one touches it."[^80] This metaphor captures how Yi's betrayal continues to inflict pain on Korean historical consciousness, particularly because his earlier nationalist credentials made his collaboration so shocking.

Critics emphasize that Yi was not merely a passive collaborator but an active and enthusiastic supporter of Japanese imperialism. In 1939, he became "the first head of the pro-Japanese Korean Writers Association and lead intense efforts to Japanize (hwangminhwa) Korea."[^81] His leadership role in promoting cultural assimilation policies makes his collaboration particularly egregious—he actively worked to erase the Korean identity he had previously championed.

Yi's adoption of the Japanese name Kayama Mitsurou is viewed as symbolic of his complete capitulation to Japanese colonialism. He "eagerly adopted the name Kayama Mitsurou (香山光郎) as soon as the Sōshi-kaimei policy came into effect," demonstrating not reluctant compliance but enthusiastic participation in cultural erasure.[^82] The adverb "eagerly" is significant—Yi appears to have welcomed the opportunity to become Japanese rather than resisting it.

The verdict of the Special Committee for the Investigation of Anti-nationalist Activities, which found Yi guilty of collaboration after liberation, represents the official Korean condemnation of his actions.[^83] This legal finding confirmed that Yi's activities went beyond what could be excused as survival under occupation and constituted active betrayal of Korean national interests. The fact that he fled to the countryside after liberation demonstrates his awareness of his guilt.[^84]

Yi's exclusion from Korean currency despite his literary significance reflects ongoing popular condemnation. "Despite his foundational importance to Korean literature, Yi has not been featured on Korean currency due to his pro-Japanese activities."[^85] This decision represents a collective judgment that collaboration outweighs literary achievement in determining who merits national honor. The symbolic exclusion from currency demonstrates that Korean society has not forgiven Yi's betrayal, even while acknowledging his literary importance.

Critics also point to the particular hypocrisy of Yi's collaboration given his earlier writings. Having authored the February 8 Declaration of Independence and served as editor of the Provisional Government's newspaper, Yi possessed intimate knowledge of nationalist aspirations and the suffering caused by colonialism.[^86] His subsequent support for Japanese imperialism thus represents not ignorance but conscious betrayal of everything he had previously advocated. This makes his collaboration more morally culpable than that of individuals who never participated in the independence movement.
