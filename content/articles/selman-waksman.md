## Summary

Selman Waksman was a Ukrainian-American biochemist and microbiologist who won the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of streptomycin, the first antibiotic effective against tuberculosis. He coined the term 'antibiotic' and his laboratory discovered over twenty antibiotics. His work saved millions of lives from tuberculosis. However, his student Albert Schatz contested credit for the streptomycin discovery.
