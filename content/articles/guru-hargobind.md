## Summary

Guru Hargobind was the sixth Sikh Guru who militarized the Sikh community in response to his father Guru Arjan's martyrdom. He wore two swords symbolizing spiritual (piri) and temporal (miri) authority, establishing the concept of warrior-saint in Sikhism. He built the Akal Takht (Throne of the Timeless) facing the Golden Temple as a seat of temporal authority. He fought several battles against the Mughal forces.
