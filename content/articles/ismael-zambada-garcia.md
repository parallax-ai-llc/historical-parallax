## Summary
Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada García was a co-leader of the Sinaloa Cartel alongside Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán. He was one of the most wanted drug traffickers in the world for decades, with the US offering $15 million for his capture. He was arrested in 2024 in a dramatic operation.

## Early Life
Born around January 1, 1948, in El Álamo, Sinaloa, Mexico. He grew up as a farmer before entering the drug trade. Unlike more flamboyant narcos, he kept a low profile and was known for his organizational skills and patience. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Zambada co-led the Sinaloa Cartel for decades, overseeing the smuggling of massive quantities of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and fentanyl into the United States. Unlike El Chapo, he avoided the spotlight, rarely being photographed. He was never previously arrested or imprisoned. He managed the cartel's day-to-day operations. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
On July 25, 2024, Zambada was apprehended in El Paso, Texas, alongside Joaquín Guzmán López (El Chapo's son). Reports indicated he was lured onto a plane under false pretenses and flown to the US. He faces multiple drug trafficking charges in US federal courts. [^3]

## Positive Perspectives
- His capture was seen as a major blow to the Sinaloa Cartel [^4]
- Some community members in Sinaloa viewed him as a stabilizing figure
- His arrest demonstrated evolving US-Mexico cooperation

## Negative Perspectives
- Co-led one of the world's most powerful drug trafficking organizations [^5]
- Responsible for flooding the US with fentanyl, contributing to the overdose crisis
- Corrupted Mexican government officials at all levels
- Evaded capture for over 50 years
- His operations caused widespread violence and addiction
