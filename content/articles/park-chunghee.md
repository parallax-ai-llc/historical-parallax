## Summary

Park Chung-hee (born November 14, 1917; died October 26, 1979) was a South Korean general and politician who led the country for 18 years, from 1961 until his assassination in 1979.[^1] Seizing power in the **May 16 Military Coup**, Park is the most polarizing figure in modern Korean history. Ideally, he is revered as the architect of the **"Miracle on the Han River,"** forcing a destitute agrarian nation into the ranks of industrial powerhouses through state-led capitalism and export-oriented growth.[^2] Conversely, he is reviled as a ruthless dictator who crushed democracy under the **Yushin Constitution**, tortured dissidents, and collaborated with the Japanese colonial military.[^3] His legacy—a blend of spectacular economic success and brutal political repression—remains the central fault line in South Korean politics today.

## Early Life and Military Career

### The Poor Farm Boy and Teacher
Park was born in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province, the youngest of seven children in a notoriously poor farming family. Despite his background, he excelled academically and graduated from Daegu Normal School. He worked briefly as a strict elementary school teacher in Mungyeong but resigned to pursue his military ambitions.[^4]

### Manchukuo and Japanese Service
In 1940, Park entered the **Manchukuo Military Academy**, a training ground for the Japanese Imperial Army's puppet state in Manchuria. He graduated top of his class and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Japanese Army under the name **Takagi Masao**. He served in the Kwantung Army, fighting against Chinese guerillas (which notably included Korean independence fighters).[^5] This period remains the source of the "pro-Japanese collaborator" (Chinilpa) allegations that haunt his legacy.

### Communist Accusations and Survival
After liberation in 1945, Park joined the South Korean Constabulary. In 1948, he was arrested and sentenced to death for leading a communist cell within the military during the **Yeosu-Suncheon Rebellion**.[^6] He survived by cooperating with investigators, revealing the names of fellow communists (including his own brother's associates). His leftist past was later "cleansed" by his fervent anti-communism as president.

## The May 16 Coup and Rise to Power

On **May 16, 1961**, Major General Park Chung-hee led 3,600 soldiers across the Han River, seizing key government buildings in Seoul.[^7] The democratic but ineffective government of Prime Minister Chang Myon collapsed.
*   **SCNR:** Park established the **Supreme Council for National Reconstruction**, ruling by decree. He prioritized two things: "Anti-Communism" and "Economy."
*   **Civilian Rule:** In 1963, bowing to US pressure, Park retired from the military and ran for president, narrowly defeating Yun Posun to inaugurate the **Third Republic**.[^8]

## Presidency (1963–1979)

Park's presidency can be divided into two eras: the development-focused Third Republic and the dictatorial Fourth Republic (Yushin).

### Economic Miracle (Third Republic)
Park acted as the CEO of "Korea Inc.," personally directing the economy.
*   **Five-Year Plans:** He implemented a series of Five-Year Economic Development Plans, shifting focus from import substitution to export-oriented industrialization.[^9]
*   **Normalization with Japan (1965):** Despite massive protests, Park signed a treaty normalizing relations with Japan, securing $800 million in grants and loans. This capital was used to build the **Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO)** and the **Gyeongbu Expressway**, the arteries of Korean industry.[^10]
*   **Vietnam War:** Park dispatched over 300,000 troops to fight alongside the US in Vietnam. In return, the US provided modernization funds for the Korean military and lucrative contracts for Korean construction firms (chaebols like Hyundai and Hanjin), which fueled the economy.[^11]

### The Yushin Dictatorship (Fourth Republic)
In 1972, facing a close election result against Kim Dae-jung and changing Cold War dynamics (Nixon's visit to China), Park declared martial law and pushed through the **Yushin Constitution** ("Revitalization").[^12]
*   **President for Life:** The new constitution abolished direct elections, allowing Park to be re-elected indefinitely by a rubber-stamp electoral college (NCU). It gave him the power to dissolve parliament and appoint one-third of MPs.
*   **Emergency Decrees:** Park ruled by emergency decrees (decrees No. 1 through 9) that banned any criticism of the constitution. Dissidents were tortured by the KCIA; the 1973 kidnapping of opposition leader Kim Dae-jung from a hotel in Tokyo shocked the world.[^13]
*   **Heavy-Chemical Industry (HCI) Drive:** In 1973, Park declared the "HCI Drive," forcing chaebols to invest in shipbuilding, petrochemicals, and electronics. This "big push" created the industrial giants of today (Samsung, LG, Hyundai) but caused massive inflation and labor exploitation.[^14]

## Assassination (10.26 Incident)

By 1979, the regime was crumbling. The economy was overheating, and protests (Bu-Ma Democratic Protests) were erupting in Busan and Masan.
*   **The Dinner:** On the evening of October 26, 1979, Park was dining at a KCIA safe house with his intelligence chief **Kim Jae-gyu** and chief bodyguard **Cha Ji-cheol**.
*   **The Shot:** An argument broke out over how to handle the protests. Cha urged a violent crackdown (suggesting "mowing down" protesters with tanks). Kim Jae-gyu, feeling sidelined and fearing a bloodbath, pulled his Walther PPK and shot Cha, then Park.[^15]
*   **The End:** Park died immediately. Kim Jae-gyu was later executed, claiming he shot "the heart of Yushin" to restore democracy.

## Legacy

Park Chung-hee is the "Godfather" of modern South Korea, casting a shadow that no successor has fully escaped.

### Historical Assessment

**Positive Views:**
1.  **Economic Savior:** He is credited with ending centuries of poverty ("barley hump") and turning a war-torn basket case into the world's 10th largest economy. His "can-do" spirit (Saemaul Undong) revolutionized the rural mindset.[^16]
2.  **Strategic Vision:** He successfully navigated the Cold War, using the alliance with the US and funds from Japan/Vietnam to build a self-reliant national defense and industrial base.[^17]
3.  **Nation Builder:** Conservatives see him as a patriot who sacrificed his reputation to do the "dirty work" necessary for national survival.[^18]

**Negative Views:**
1.  **Ruthless Dictator:** He destroyed the budding democracy of the Second Republic and ruled through terror. The "Judicial Murder" of the People's Revolutionary Party (innocent men executed 18 hours after sentencing) remains a stain on the judiciary.[^19]
2.  **Original Sin:** His service in the Japanese military makes his nationalism suspect to many nationalists.
3.  **Chaebol Republic:** Critics argue his policies created the corrupt government-business nexus (chaebol dominance) that stifles SMEs and fuels inequality today.[^20]
