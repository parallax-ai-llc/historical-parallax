## Summary

Oswald Avery was a Canadian-American physician and molecular biologist who, along with Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty, demonstrated in 1944 that DNA is the substance that causes bacterial transformation. This Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment was a pivotal discovery establishing DNA as the carrier of genetic information, though it was not immediately accepted. Many consider him one of the most deserving scientists not to receive a Nobel Prize.
