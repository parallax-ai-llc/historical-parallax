## Summary

James Franck was a German-American physicist who shared the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics for the Franck-Hertz experiment, which provided the first experimental evidence that energy levels in atoms are quantized. He later opposed the military use of atomic weapons and authored the Franck Report recommending a demonstration of the bomb before use on civilians.
