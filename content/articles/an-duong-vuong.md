## Summary

An Duong Vuong (personal name Thuc Phan) was the founding king and sole ruler of the ancient Vietnamese kingdom of Au Lac, which existed from 257 to 207 BCE in the Red River Delta region.[^1] As leader of the Au Viet tribes, he defeated the last Hung king of Van Lang, unified the Lac Viet and Au Viet peoples, and established his capital at the formidable Co Loa Citadel near modern-day Hanoi.[^2] His reign marked a pivotal period in Vietnamese history, characterized by military innovation, advanced bronze-working technology, and successful resistance against Qin Dynasty expansion.[^3] However, his kingdom ultimately fell to the Nanyue forces of Zhao Tuo in 207 BCE, ending with An Duong Vuong's tragic death.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

The origins of Thuc Phan, who would become King An Duong Vuong, remain one of the most debated topics in Vietnamese historiography. According to traditional Vietnamese histories recorded in ancient Chinese literature such as Giao Chau Ngoai Vuc Ky, Quang Chau Ky, and the 15th-century Dai Viet su ky toan thu, An Duong Vuong was described as the "son of King Thuc" (Thuc Vuong Tu), claiming he was either a prince or king of the Kingdom of Shu in modern Sichuan.[^5] The Dai Viet su ky toan thu specifically recorded that Thuc Phan had "family name Thuc, given name Phan, from Ba Thuc land."[^6]

The Kingdom of Shu was conquered by King Huiwen of Qin in 316 BCE, and according to legend, descendants from Ba Thuc land fled south to escape Qin persecution, eventually entering Viet lands.[^7] In the 1950s, prominent historians such as Tran Van Giap and Dao Duy Anh defended this traditional theory, arguing that An Duong Vuong's Shu origin was historically accurate.[^8] They proposed that after the Shu kingdom's destruction by Qin forces, royal descendants migrated southward through treacherous terrain to establish themselves among the Vietnamese peoples.

However, many modern historians express skepticism about this origin story. The Kham dinh Viet su Thong giam cuong muc raised doubts, questioning how a Shu prince could traverse thousands of miles through forests and multiple kingdoms to invade Van Lang.[^9] The chronological inconsistency—with Shu falling in 316 BCE but An Duong Vuong not founding Au Lac until 257 BCE—makes his position as king or prince of Shu historically tenuous.[^10]

Alternative theories suggest that the "King of Shu" referenced in historical texts was not the ruler of Ba Shu proper, but rather the chief of a Jiang tribe that migrated from Shu to the south, with that tribal group settling in Guangxi and the Northern Delta region.[^11] Contemporary scholarly consensus holds that Thuc Phan was more likely "the head of Au Viet community from the mountainous areas of Viet Bac – Tay Bac along the Red River basin to the delta."[^12] This interpretation positions him as an indigenous or long-settled leader rather than a recent Chinese emigrant, though the debate continues among Vietnamese historians today.[^13]

---

## Rise to Power

The rise of Thuc Phan to become King An Duong Vuong occurred during a tumultuous period when the expansionist Qin Dynasty threatened the independence of the Baiyue peoples of southern China and northern Vietnam. In 218 BCE, the Qin Dynasty launched a massive invasion of the Bach Viet region, which included the territories of both Van Lang and the Au Viet lands. According to the Huainan Zi, an ancient Chinese text, 500,000 Qin soldiers were divided into five armies, with two armies specifically targeting Quang Tay, the land of Tay Au (Au Viet).[^14]

This Qin invasion proved to be the catalyst for Thuc Phan's emergence as a military and political leader. The Vietnamese forces, vastly outnumbered by Qin troops, employed guerrilla warfare tactics that would become characteristic of Vietnamese military strategy for millennia. The Huainan Zi records that "Viet people ran into forests to stay with animals instead of being caught by Qin troops," and they agreed to appoint the most talented individual as general to organize nighttime attacks against the invaders.[^15]

Under Thuc Phan's leadership, the combined forces of the Lac Viet and Au Viet peoples launched a decisive campaign against the Qin invaders. The Vietnamese forces gathered their strength and "launched a big battle to destroy the enemy, defeated the whole Qin troop, killed the dominant general Tu Sui, resulting in the cancel of marching orders of the Qin Dynasty."[^16] This victory, achieved against a Qin force of 50,000 troops, is celebrated as "the first glorious victory of the whole Vietnamese people against the invasion of the Northern feudalist."[^17]

The successful resistance against Qin expansion dramatically elevated Thuc Phan's reputation and authority. Through this battle, "the role and reputation of Thuc Phan, the outstanding leader of the tribal alliance of Tay Au, not only was increased within the Tay Au tribe but also had a profound impact to the Lac Viet tribe."[^18] Capitalizing on this military prestige and the political momentum it generated, Thuc Phan moved against the weakened Hung dynasty of Van Lang.

In 257 BCE, Thuc Phan, as leader of the Au Viet tribes, overthrew the last Hung king and unified the two kingdoms of Nam Cuong (Au Viet) and Van Lang (Lac Viet).[^19] He established the new polity of Au Lac—the name itself reflecting the merger of the two peoples, combining "Au" (Au Viet) and "Lac" (Lac Viet).[^20] Proclaiming himself King An Duong (meaning "King of Pacifying the Duong"), Thuc Phan founded what historians recognize as Vietnam's third major dynasty, succeeding both the legendary Hong Bang period and creating a more centralized state structure.[^21]

## Major Achievements

### Military Innovation and the Legendary Crossbow

One of An Duong Vuong's most celebrated achievements centers on the development of advanced military technology, particularly the legendary "magic crossbow" that has become central to Vietnamese folklore and historical memory. According to legend, the mythical golden turtle deity Kim Quy appeared to An Duong Vuong and gave him one of his golden claws as a trigger for a magical crossbow that could kill 300 enemies with a single shot.[^22] The weapon was called the "Saintly Crossbow of the Supernaturally Luminous Golden Claw," and the turtle instructed the king to have it crafted by a man named Cao Lo (or Cao Thong), assuring him he would be invincible with it.[^23]

While the supernatural elements are clearly legendary, recent archaeological evidence has provided remarkable support for the historical reality behind the myth. Excavations at Co Loa have revealed "a large-scale, well-organised weapons manufacturing centre capable of mass production, which experts regard as one of the most significant ancient military relics in Southeast Asia."[^24] Investigations in the Inner Wall area uncovered sophisticated bronze-working operations on a massive scale, including molds for crossbow bolts made of bronze and bronze trigger mechanisms for crossbows.[^25] The fact that the foundry remains intact has led researchers to conclude that "Co Loa was never taken by the enemy, and that the victory over the Qin forces was indeed real."[^26]

### Construction of Co Loa Citadel

Perhaps An Duong Vuong's greatest achievement was the construction of Co Loa Citadel, which served as the capital of the Au Lac Kingdom and stands as "the oldest, the most unique and the largest citadel in scale of all the Vietnamese citadels in the history."[^27] Located in Tay Vu (present-day Dong Anh District, approximately 17 kilometers north of modern Hanoi), Co Loa was an engineering marvel of ancient Southeast Asia.[^28]

The citadel featured a unique spiral layout with multi-layered defensive walls designed to confuse and deter attackers. Though originally consisting of nine concentric walls according to legend, today three primary walls remain: the outer, middle, and inner citadels.[^29] The outer walls extended approximately 8 kilometers in circumference and stood 4-5 meters high, providing formidable defenses.[^30] Archaeological excavations conducted in 1970 uncovered Dong Son culture sherds stratified beneath the walls, while subsequent investigations in 2004-05, 2007-08, and seven years of joint excavations by the Vietnam Archaeology Institute, Thang Long Ha Noi Heritage Conservation Centre, and University of Wisconsin-Madison have revealed the citadel's sophisticated construction.[^31]

In 2012, Co Loa was designated as a Special National Monument, recognizing its historical, artistic, and archaeological value as a vital part of Vietnam's national heritage.[^32]

### Advancement of Bronze-Casting Technology

An Duong Vuong's reign coincided with and promoted the flourishing of the Dong Son culture, a Bronze Age civilization centered in the Red River Valley from 1000 BCE until the first century CE.[^33] The king is remembered as "a ruler with many achievements in the military art, wet rice farming, and bronze casting technique."[^34]

Archaeological discoveries at Co Loa demonstrate the extraordinary sophistication of bronze-working during An Duong Vuong's reign. A massive bronze drum weighing 72 kilograms was excavated outside the inner wall in the 1980s, standing 57 cm high with a tympanum diameter of 73.6 cm and containing approximately 200 pieces of bronze.[^35] The production of this drum alone would have required smelting between 1 and 7 tonnes of copper ore, demonstrating remarkable metallurgical capabilities.[^36]

Excavations have yielded thousands of bronze artifacts, including socketed hoes and ploughshares (96 examples), socketed axes, spearheads, bronze arrows, plows, and various ceremonial objects.[^37] The bronze weapons, tools, and drums of Dong Son sites show indigenous Southeast Asian influences, indicating an indigenous origin for the bronze-casting technology rather than mere imitation of Chinese techniques.[^38] Lost-wax casting techniques, while based on Chinese founders, incorporated distinctly local scenes including drummers and musicians, warriors, rice processing, birds, deer, war vessels, and geometric designs.[^39]

### Agricultural Development

An Duong Vuong's achievements extended beyond military and architectural accomplishments to include significant advances in wet rice agriculture. The Au Lac state "continued to govern the population in the style of the Van Lang state but at a higher level," suggesting administrative improvements and agricultural intensification.[^40] The Red River Delta, formed by alluvial deposits from the Red River and Thai Binh River, provided ideal conditions for rice cultivation, and the ancient Viet people under An Duong Vuong's rule further developed sophisticated wet rice farming systems.[^41]

The abundant archaeological evidence of bronze agricultural implements—particularly the 96 socketed ploughshares that numerically dominate the artifact assemblage at Co Loa—demonstrates the importance of agricultural production during this period.[^42] These bronze tools would have significantly increased agricultural efficiency compared to earlier stone or wooden implements, supporting population growth and state consolidation.

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Historical Authenticity Debates

The greatest controversy surrounding An Duong Vuong concerns the historical authenticity of traditional accounts of his life and reign. The limitation of contemporary written evidence means that "the main sources of information about the Hong Bang period are the many vestiges, objects and artifacts that have been recovered from archaeological sites - as well as a considerable amount of legend."[^43] The first historical records pertaining to the people in the Red River Delta were written by the Chinese after they conquered the area in the third century BCE, meaning contemporary written records about An Duong Vuong's period are primarily from Chinese sources rather than indigenous Vietnamese texts.[^44]

This reliance on legend and later historiography has led to significant scholarly disputes. The question of Thuc Phan's Shu kingdom origins remains unresolved, with historians divided between those who accept the traditional narrative and those who view it as a later invention designed to provide the Au Lac kingdom with a prestigious foreign pedigree.[^45] Critics argue that the chronological inconsistencies and geographic improbabilities make the Shu connection untenable, while defenders maintain that migration from Shu after its conquest by Qin in 316 BCE is historically plausible.[^46]

### Military Defeat and Strategic Failures

Despite his earlier victory against the Qin Dynasty forces, An Duong Vuong ultimately failed to maintain Au Lac's independence against the Nanyue kingdom. In 207 BCE, Zhao Tuo (Vietnamese: Trieu Da), a Qin Chinese general who had established the independent kingdom of Nanyue with its capital in Panyu (modern Guangzhou) in 204 BCE, successfully conquered Au Lac.[^47]

The circumstances of this defeat reveal potential weaknesses in An Duong Vuong's strategic judgment. According to legend, Zhao Tuo "devised a scheme to overthrow the second dynasty" by proposing a marriage between his son Trong Thuy (Zhong Shi) and An Duong Vuong's daughter My Chau.[^48] The king "doubtlessly allowed Trong Thuy to take his dear daughter as a wife," suggesting he was either politically naive or overconfident in his defensive capabilities.[^49]

This marriage alliance, rather than securing peace, became the mechanism for Au Lac's downfall. The king's failure to protect the secret of his kingdom's most important military asset—the magic crossbow trigger—represents a catastrophic security failure, whether or not the legendary account is literally true.[^50] The ease with which Zhao Tuo's forces conquered Co Loa once they possessed knowledge of Vietnamese defensive capabilities suggests that An Duong Vuong may have relied too heavily on a single defensive technology or strategy.

### Political Legacy: Zhao Tuo's Extended Rule

Following the conquest, Zhao Tuo "incorporated the regions into his Nanyue domain, but left the indigenous chiefs in control of the population with the royal court in Co Loa."[^51] This arrangement reveals that An Duong Vuong had not created sufficiently strong political institutions to resist foreign domination. The relative ease of the transition suggests that local elites may not have been deeply committed to the Au Lac state, or that the kingdom's political integration of the Lac Viet and Au Viet peoples remained incomplete.

The current government of Vietnam portrays Zhao Tuo negatively as a foreign invader who vanquished Vietnam's heroic King An Duong, though historically he was remembered differently for centuries.[^52] This shifting historical interpretation reflects ongoing tensions about An Duong Vuong's legacy: was his reign a glorious moment of Vietnamese independence, or merely an interlude between periods of Chinese influence and control?

### The Tragedy of My Chau

The most controversial aspect of An Duong Vuong's story is the tragic ending involving his daughter My Chau. According to legend, when the king discovered that My Chau had unwittingly betrayed the secret of the magic crossbow to her husband Trong Thuy, "An Duong Vuong killed My Chau instantly, then disappeared into the sea for good."[^53] While this account is clearly legendary, it presents An Duong Vuong in a harsh light—as a father who chose political vengeance over paternal love, executing his own daughter for a betrayal that resulted from innocence and trust rather than malicious intent.

This narrative element has made the An Duong Vuong story morally complex in Vietnamese cultural memory, transforming it from a simple tale of heroic resistance into a tragedy about the human costs of political conflict and the impossible choices faced by rulers caught between family loyalty and national duty.[^54]

---

## Personal Life

Historical records provide limited information about An Duong Vuong's personal life beyond the legendary accounts that have been passed down through Vietnamese folklore. The most prominent aspect of his personal life in traditional narratives concerns his relationship with his daughter, Princess My Chau, whose story has become one of the most enduring legends in Vietnamese culture.[^55]

According to the legend recorded in the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long historical documentation, Princess My Chau was the beloved daughter of King An Duong Vuong.[^56] The king's deep affection for his daughter is evident in his decision to allow her marriage to Trong Thuy, son of his rival Zhao Tuo, despite the political risks such an alliance might entail.[^57] This suggests a father who valued his daughter's happiness and sought peaceful relations with neighboring powers through diplomatic marriage.

The legend portrays My Chau as innocent and trusting, genuinely in love with her husband. When Trong Thuy asked about Co Loa's defenses, "honestly the innocent princess replied her husband that there was nothing but solid defence works in the citadel and a crossbow with a magic trigger which was kept in the king sleeping room."[^58] This betrayal was not malicious but resulted from the natural confidence between husband and wife, making the subsequent tragedy all the more poignant.

The relationship between An Duong Vuong and the supernatural is another significant aspect of his personal life as portrayed in Vietnamese tradition. The legend of Kim Quy, the Golden Turtle deity, depicts the king as someone who enjoyed divine favor and supernatural assistance.[^59] After helping An Duong Vuong build Co Loa Citadel, "saint Kim Qui offered him one of his claws to make a trigger of crossbow to protect the citadel from enemies."[^60] This mythological relationship suggests that An Duong Vuong was perceived as a ruler with special spiritual connections, a common trope in ancient Vietnamese kingship.

The king's character is also revealed in the legendary accounts of Co Loa's construction. According to folklore, the initial attempts to construct the citadel walls were "thwarted by unknown forces, causing them to repeatedly collapse."[^61] Rather than abandoning the project, An Duong Vuong persevered until the sacred golden turtle appeared to offer assistance, suggesting determination and persistence as personal characteristics.[^62]

The tragic end of An Duong Vuong's life reveals the depth of his despair at his kingdom's fall. After fleeing with My Chau and learning of her unwitting betrayal through the trail of goose feathers she left for her husband to follow, the king killed his daughter in anguish and then "disappeared into the sea for good."[^63] This suicide, whether historical or legendary, has been interpreted as the act of a man who could not bear the combined weight of political defeat, personal betrayal, and the terrible deed of killing his own child.

## Legacy

An Duong Vuong's legacy extends far beyond his 50-year reign, profoundly shaping Vietnamese historical consciousness, cultural identity, and national mythology. His story embodies many of the enduring themes of Vietnamese history: resistance against foreign invasion, technological innovation, the tragedy of political division, and the human cost of war and statecraft.

### Architectural and Archaeological Legacy

Co Loa Citadel stands as the most tangible and enduring monument to An Duong Vuong's reign. As Vietnam's oldest fortified settlement and archaeological site with various relics of the Bronze Age Phung Nguyen culture and Dong Son culture, Co Loa provides invaluable evidence about ancient Vietnamese civilization.[^64] The site remained "an important political center of Vietnamese people until the 10th century," demonstrating the lasting strategic importance of An Duong Vuong's choice of location.[^65]

The citadel's designation as a Special National Monument in 2012 ensures its preservation as a vital part of Vietnam's national heritage.[^66] Archaeological discoveries continue to shed light on the sophistication of An Duong Vuong's kingdom, with excavations revealing advanced bronze-working, weapons manufacturing, and urban planning that challenge assumptions about the development of Southeast Asian civilizations.[^67]

A statue of King An Duong Vuong at the Co Loa Special National Relic site has been recognized as a national treasure, featuring rare artistic qualities that make it unique among Vietnamese historical monuments.[^68] This physical commemoration ensures that An Duong Vuong remains a visible presence in contemporary Vietnamese cultural landscape.

### Cultural and Religious Legacy

An Duong Vuong is worshipped at temples throughout Vietnam, most prominently at the Upper Temple (Den Thuong) in Dong Anh District, Hanoi.[^69] The annual Co Loa Festival, held from the 6th to 16th day of the first lunar month (just after Lunar New Year), draws thousands of pilgrims and has been recognized on the List of National Intangible Cultural Heritage.[^70]

During the festival, "eight communes perform incense offering ceremonies at their communal houses, while at Thuong Temple, village officials conduct ceremonies to honor the King's achievements."[^71] The main festival features "solemn and imposing processions of 12 palanquins" around the Trong Thuy Well to the village gate, with evening fireworks displays and traditional performances of ca tru, cheo, and tuong.[^72] Traditional games including cock fighting, human chess, tug of war, and wrestling recreate the cultural atmosphere of ancient Vietnam.[^73]

This continued religious veneration demonstrates that An Duong Vuong is not merely a historical figure but remains an active presence in Vietnamese spiritual life, embodying the ancestors who established Vietnamese civilization and defended it against foreign threats.

### Literary and Folkloric Legacy

The legend of An Duong Vuong, Princess My Chau, and Trong Thuy has become one of the most beloved stories in Vietnamese literature and folklore. The tale has been adapted into numerous literary works, theatrical performances, and modern retellings.[^74] A particularly poignant detail from the legend states that "when My Chau died, her blood leaked into the sea, oyster ate it then born precious pearl. If this kind of pearl was washed by water from Trong Thuy's well, it would be much brighter."[^75] This etiological element, explaining the origin of pearls, demonstrates how the An Duong Vuong legend permeates Vietnamese cultural consciousness at multiple levels.

### Historical and National Identity Legacy

An Duong Vuong occupies a crucial position in Vietnamese historical narratives as a bridge between the legendary Hong Bang period and documented historical eras. His successful resistance against the Qin Dynasty in 218 BCE represents the first well-documented Vietnamese military victory against Chinese expansion, establishing patterns of guerrilla warfare and national mobilization that would be repeated throughout Vietnamese history.[^76]

The debate over An Duong Vuong's origins—whether he was an indigenous Au Viet leader or a Shu prince from China—reflects larger questions about Vietnamese identity and the relationship between Vietnam and China. That this question remains unresolved after decades of scholarly research by great Vietnamese historians demonstrates the enduring importance of An Duong Vuong to Vietnamese self-understanding.[^77]

Contemporary Vietnamese education and popular culture continue to celebrate An Duong Vuong as a symbol of Vietnamese ingenuity, military prowess, and state-building capability. Streets in Hanoi and other Vietnamese cities bear his name, ensuring that new generations of Vietnamese encounter his legacy in their daily lives.[^78]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholarly defenders of An Duong Vuong's historical importance emphasize his role as a state-builder who successfully unified competing tribal groups and created Vietnam's first truly centralized kingdom. The Au Lac state represented an advancement over the Van Lang confederation, with historians noting that it "continued to govern the population in the style of the Van Lang state but at a higher level."[^79] This administrative development laid groundwork for subsequent Vietnamese states.

Archaeologists and military historians have increasingly recognized the sophistication of An Duong Vuong's military innovations. Recent archaeological research has vindicated legendary accounts of Co Loa's weapons manufacturing capabilities, revealing "a large-scale, well-organised weapons manufacturing centre capable of mass production, which experts regard as one of the most significant ancient military relics in Southeast Asia."[^80] The discovery of bronze crossbow components and trigger mechanisms demonstrates that the "magic crossbow" legend preserves genuine historical memory of technological advancement.[^81]

Scholars see Co Loa as "an invaluable site because it holds archaeological evidence from the Bronze Age Phung Nguyen and Dong Son cultures, offering insights into the technological advancements and societal structure of ancient Vietnam."[^82] The citadel's sophisticated design—with its unique spiral layout and multiple defensive walls—demonstrates engineering capabilities that challenge previous assumptions about ancient Southeast Asian civilizations.[^83]

Historians who support the traditional narrative of An Duong Vuong's Shu origins, including prominent scholars like Tran Van Giap and Dao Duy Anh, argue that his foreign background does not diminish his importance to Vietnamese history.[^84] They contend that his successful integration of immigrant Au Viet groups with indigenous Lac Viet peoples created a more diverse and resilient society, and that his victory over the Qin invasion in 218 BCE represents a genuine moment of Vietnamese national consciousness emerging from common resistance to foreign aggression.[^85]

Cultural historians emphasize An Duong Vuong's enduring presence in Vietnamese spiritual and cultural life. The continued celebration of the Co Loa Festival and veneration of the king at temples throughout Vietnam demonstrates that he remains "an important figure in Vietnamese history and culture."[^86] The An Duong Vuong legend, with its themes of technological innovation, tragic love, betrayal, and the conflict between personal and national loyalty, provides Vietnamese culture with a foundational narrative that explores the complexities of political leadership and human relationships.[^87]

### Negative Views

Critics of An Duong Vuong's historical legacy point to the limited contemporary documentation, arguing that much of what is "known" about him is legend rather than history. The fact that "the first historical records pertaining to the people in the Red River Delta were written by the Chinese after they had conquered the area in the third century BC" means that accounts of An Duong Vuong's reign were filtered through the perspectives of his conquerors.[^88]

Skeptical historians challenge the Shu origin story as chronologically implausible and geographically improbable. As the Kham dinh Viet su Thong giam cuong muc questioned, it seems "impossible for a Shu prince to cross thousands of miles through forests and many kingdoms to invade Van Lang."[^89] These scholars view the Shu connection as a later invention designed to provide the Au Lac kingdom with a prestigious foreign lineage, reflecting later periods' concerns rather than historical reality.[^90]

Military historians critical of An Duong Vuong point to his ultimate defeat by Zhao Tuo as evidence of strategic failures. While he successfully repelled the Qin invasion in 218 BCE, he apparently learned the wrong lessons from that victory, relying too heavily on defensive fortifications and the supposed magic crossbow while neglecting diplomatic and intelligence capabilities.[^91] His apparent willingness to enter a marriage alliance with Zhao Tuo's family without adequate precautions suggests political naivety or overconfidence that proved fatal to his kingdom.[^92]

Some scholars argue that An Duong Vuong's unification of the Au Viet and Lac Viet peoples was superficial and incomplete, pointing to the apparent ease with which Zhao Tuo conquered Au Lac and incorporated it into Nanyue.[^93] The fact that Zhao Tuo "left the indigenous chiefs in control of the population with the royal court in Co Loa" suggests that the local power structure remained largely intact and was willing to accommodate new overlords, indicating weak loyalty to the Au Lac state.[^94]

Critics also note the moral ambiguity of the An Duong Vuong legend's conclusion, where the king murders his own daughter. While defenders interpret this as tragic necessity, critics see it as representing the failures of patriarchal authority and the destructive nature of political absolutism.[^95] The legend's transformation of what might have been a straightforward military defeat into a family tragedy involving betrayal and filicide arguably obscures rather than illuminates the actual historical processes that led to Au Lac's fall.[^96]

Contemporary historians must grapple with the politicization of An Duong Vuong's memory. The current Vietnamese government's portrayal of Zhao Tuo as a foreign invader who vanquished Vietnam's heroic King An Duong represents a nationalist interpretation that "has not always been the historical memory," suggesting that An Duong Vuong's legacy has been reshaped to serve modern political purposes rather than reflecting historical complexities.[^97]
