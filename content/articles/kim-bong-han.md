## Summary

Kim Bong-han was a North Korean anatomist who claimed to have discovered a new circulatory system (Bonghan system/primo-vascular system) corresponding to acupuncture meridians. Though his original claims were controversial and poorly documented, renewed research in the 21st century has identified thread-like structures that some researchers associate with his observations.
