## Summary

Mario Capecchi is an Italian-born American molecular geneticist who shared the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering principles of gene targeting in mice using embryonic stem cells. His work made it possible to create 'knockout mice' in which specific genes are disabled, revolutionizing biomedical research. He survived homelessness as a child in war-torn Italy before being adopted and brought to America.
