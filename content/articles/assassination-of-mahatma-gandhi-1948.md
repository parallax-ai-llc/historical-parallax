## Overview

On January 30, 1948, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi—revered as the Father of the Nation in India and known worldwide as Mahatma ("Great Soul")—was assassinated in New Delhi. Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, shot Gandhi three times at point-blank range as the 78-year-old leader walked to his evening prayer meeting. Gandhi's last words were reportedly "He Ram" ("Oh God"). His death came just five months after India achieved the independence he had spent his life fighting for.

## Background

### Gandhi's Final Days

**Independence (August 15, 1947):**
India achieved independence from British rule, but was partitioned into India (Hindu-majority) and Pakistan (Muslim-majority).

**Partition Violence:**
Partition triggered massive communal violence. Approximately 1 million killed; 10-20 million displaced in largest mass migration in history.

**Gandhi's Response:**
Gandhi, devastated by violence, embarked on fasts and peace marches in affected areas.

**Fast unto Death (January 1948):**
Gandhi fasted in Delhi demanding end to Hindu-Muslim violence. Fast ended January 18 after community leaders pledged peace.

### Hindu Nationalist Opposition

**Criticism of Gandhi:**
Some Hindu nationalists considered Gandhi too sympathetic to Muslims:
- Supported partition (though reluctantly)
- Protected Muslims during riots
- Insisted on paying Pakistan its share of British India assets

**Previous Attempt:**
January 20, 1948—just 10 days before assassination—bomb thrown at Gandhi's prayer meeting by Madanlal Pahwa. No injuries. Conspiracy not fully investigated.
