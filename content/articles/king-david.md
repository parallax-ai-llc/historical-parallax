## Summary

King David was the second king of Israel who united the twelve tribes and established Jerusalem as the capital. He is traditionally credited with composing many of the Psalms. His dynasty was promised an eternal throne by God (the Davidic covenant), which became the basis for Jewish messianic expectations. He is one of the most important figures in Jewish history and tradition.
