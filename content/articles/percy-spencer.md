## Summary

Percy Spencer was an American engineer and inventor who accidentally discovered that microwave radiation could cook food, leading to the invention of the microwave oven. While working on magnetrons for radar at Raytheon, he noticed a candy bar in his pocket had melted. His subsequent experiments led to the first commercial microwave oven in 1947. Spencer held 300 patents despite having no formal education.
