## Overview

On October 26, 1909, Korean independence activist An Jung-geun (안중근) assassinated Ito Hirobumi, Japan's most prominent statesman and the architect of Korea's subjugation, at Harbin Railway Station in Manchuria. Firing three shots from a Belgian-made Browning pistol, An Jung-geun killed the man responsible for forcing Korea into a protectorate and paving the way for annexation. An was arrested, tried, and executed, but became one of Korea's greatest national heroes.
