## Summary

Saints Cyril and Methodius were Byzantine Greek brothers who became missionaries to the Slavic peoples. Cyril (born Constantine) created the Glagolitic alphabet, from which the Cyrillic alphabet developed, to translate the Bible and liturgical texts into Slavonic. They are credited with founding Slavic literacy and culture. They were declared co-patrons of Europe by Pope John Paul II alongside Benedict of Nursia.
