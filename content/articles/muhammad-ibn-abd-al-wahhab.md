## Summary

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792) was an Arab Islamic scholar, theologian, and religious reformer from Najd in central Arabia who founded the Wahhabi movement.[^1] He is best known for forming a historic 1744 alliance with Muhammad ibn Saud that established the First Saudi State and created a dynastic partnership between religious and political authority that continues in modern Saudi Arabia.[^2] His teachings emphasized strict monotheism (tawhid) and the rejection of practices he considered innovations in Islam, leading to both significant influence across the Muslim world and sustained controversy among Islamic scholars.[^3] His legacy remains deeply contested, with supporters viewing him as a religious reformer who purified Islam, while critics accuse him of promoting intolerance and excommunication of fellow Muslims.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in the village of 'Uyayna, located in the Najd region of central Arabia, into the sedentary and impoverished Arab clan of Banu Tamim.[^5] He came from a prominent family of Islamic scholars deeply rooted in Hanbali jurisprudence. His grandfather, Sulayman ibn Ali, was probably the greatest scholar in Najd during the Eleventh Century and served as the judge of al-Uyayna.[^6] His father, Abd al-Wahhab, was also a distinguished scholar and judge in al-Uyayna, specialized in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence).[^7]

From an early age, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab demonstrated exceptional intellectual abilities. His father supervised his early education, which consisted of learning the Quran by heart and studying a rudimentary level of Hanbali jurisprudence.[^8] By the age of ten, he had memorized the entire Quran, a remarkable achievement that signaled his future as a religious scholar.[^9] He reached puberty around the age of twelve, at which point his father deemed him qualified to serve as the Imam for prayers and appointed him to that position.[^10] At this same young age, his father arranged his marriage, as was customary in the region.[^11]

Despite his family's scholarly tradition, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab had modest access to Islamic education during his youth, as there was a very limited history of Islamic education in the Najd area.[^12] This relative isolation may have contributed to his later desire to seek knowledge beyond his homeland. Around the age of twelve, his father gave him permission to perform the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, during which he traveled to Medina and stayed for two months.[^13] This early exposure to the broader Islamic world would prove formative in shaping his religious outlook and reformist ambitions.

## Rise to Power

After leaving 'Uyayna around the age of twenty, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab embarked on an extensive journey of religious study that would fundamentally shape his theological views.[^14] He performed the Greater Pilgrimage in Mecca, where he found that many scholars held opinions and espoused teachings that were unpalatable to him.[^15] Following this, he traveled to Medina, a stay that proved "decisive in shaping the later direction of his thought."[^16]

In Medina, he studied under several influential teachers who would profoundly impact his religious ideology. He met Abd Allah ibn Ibrahim al-Najdi, a Hanbali theologian from Najd who supported the works of the medieval scholar Ibn Taymiyyah.[^17] More significantly, he studied under Muhammad Hayat al-Sindi, a figure from the Indian subcontinent who had witnessed the deterioration of the Mughal Empire and inculcated in Ibn Abd al-Wahhab the idea that pure forms of Islam could regenerate lost political glories.[^18] According to Ibn Abdul-Wahhab's great-grandson Abdul-Lateef ibn Abdur-Rahman, al-Sindi had the greatest influence on him with respect to tawheed (monotheism), freeing oneself from blind obedience (taqleed), and preoccupying oneself with the study of the Quran and Sunnah.[^19]

Following his education in Medina, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab traveled to Basra, an active center of Islamic culture, where he studied Hadith and Fiqh under the Islamic scholar Muhammad al-Majmu'i.[^20] By this time he was considered an erudite young scholar, and his teacher allowed his own children to study with Ibn Abd al-Wahhab.[^21] During his stay in Baghdad, he married an affluent woman whose property he inherited when she died, providing him with financial independence.[^22] In 1736, while in Iran, he began to teach against what he considered to be the extreme ideas of various exponents of Sufi doctrines.[^23]

In 1740, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab returned to his native village of Uyayna, where he began actively preaching his reformist doctrines.[^24] The local ruler (amir) Uthman ibn Bishr adopted his teachings and began to act on some of them, including controversial actions such as destroying tombs in the area that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab viewed as promoting idolatry.[^25] One of his most provocative acts was persuading Ibn Mu'ammar to help him level the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad, whose shrine was revered by locals.[^26] He also ordered the cutting down of trees considered sacred by the local population.[^27]

When this activity caused a popular backlash and attracted the attention of powerful regional forces, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's position in Uyayna became untenable. The Banu Khalid tribe, who ruled al-Hasa in eastern Arabia and held considerable influence over Uyayna, compelled Ibn Mu'ammar to expel Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab from the town in 1744.[^28] Facing expulsion, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab found refuge among the clan of Al Saud in nearby Dir'iyah, further south.[^29]

In 1744, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab formed a historic pact with Muhammad ibn Saud, the local leader of Dir'iyah, establishing a politico-religious alliance that would last for more than 250 years.[^30] This alliance established a clear division of responsibilities: Ibn Abd al-Wahhab would be responsible for religious matters while Ibn Saud controlled military, political, and economic affairs.[^31] The alliance was further cemented through marriage, as Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's daughter married Muhammad bin Saud's son.[^32] By offering the Al Saud family a clearly defined religious mission, the alliance provided the ideological impetus for Saudi territorial expansion.[^33]

## Major Achievements

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's most significant achievement was the formulation and propagation of a religious reform movement centered on the principle of tawhid, or strict monotheism.[^34] His theological framework emphasized a return to what he believed were the fundamental principles of Islam, rejecting sources of doctrine apart from the Quran and the Sunnah (traditions of the Prophet Muhammad).[^35] He made a clear stand against traditions and practices not rooted in these two primary sources, characterizing them as innovations (bid'ah) in Islamic faith that constituted forms of polytheism (shirk).[^36]

His main theological work, Kitab at-Tawhid (The Book of Oneness), became the foundational text for Wahhabi doctrines and remains the primary source for Salafi beliefs on monotheism.[^37] The book draws extensively from material in the Quran and the recorded doings and sayings of the Prophet Muhammad in the Hadith literature.[^38] As a gifted communicator with a talent for breaking down complex ideas into simpler units, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab titled his treatises with accessible terms such as qawa'id ("principles"), masa'il ("matters"), kalimat ("phrases"), or usul ("foundations"), simplifying his texts point by point for mass reading.[^39]

Beyond Kitab at-Tawhid, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab produced numerous other works, though they were generally short and full of quotations from the Quran and Hadith.[^40] A summary of his teachings appears in Al-usul al-thalathah wa-adillatuha (The Three Roots and Their Proofs).[^41] He also wrote Masa'il al-Jahiliyyah (The Foundations of Islam), Mukhtasar Seerah ar-Rasul (an abridged biography of Prophet Muhammad), and various sermons published in Khutab al-shaykh (Sermons of the Shaykh).[^42]

The 1744 pact between Muhammad ibn Saud and Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab marked the rise of the First Saudi State, the Emirate of Diriyah, which had been established in 1727.[^43] This alliance became a "mutual support pact" and power-sharing arrangement between the Al Saud family and the Al ash-Sheikh (descendants of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab) that remained in place for nearly 300 years.[^44] The arrangement was based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh's authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating Salafi doctrine, while in return, the Al ash-Sheikh used their religious-moral authority to legitimize the royal family's rule.[^45]

Under this alliance, the House of Saud and its allies quickly rose to become the dominant power in Arabia. They first conquered Najd, then expanded their influence over the eastern coast from Kuwait down to the northern borders of Oman, while Saudi forces also captured the highlands of Asir.[^46] A pivotal eastward thrust occurred in 1795, when Saudi forces overran the al-Hasa oasis, defeating the Bani Khalid emirs and securing vital grain supplies, water resources, and access to pearl-diving revenues.[^47] Al-Qasim was fully incorporated by the 1780s through subjugation of holdout clans.[^48]

Following Ibn Saud's death in 1765, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab remained a major counselor to his successor, Abd al-Aziz, and continued to preach and write until his own death in 1792.[^49] By 1773, a clear separation of roles between the Saudi family and the Wahhabi clerics had begun to emerge, with Ibn Abd al-Wahhab retiring from front-line politics while maintaining his religious authority.[^50] His teachings were championed as the official creed in the three Saudi States for more than two centuries.[^51]

The Wahhabi movement gradually rose to prominence as an influential anti-colonial reform trend in the Islamic world that advocated the regeneration of the social and political prowess of Muslims.[^52] Its revolutionary themes inspired several Islamic revivalists, scholars, pan-Islamist ideologues, and anti-colonial activists as far as West Africa.[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's doctrines were criticized by numerous Islamic scholars during his lifetime, with opponents accusing him of disregarding Islamic history, monuments, traditions, and the sanctity of Muslim life.[^54] His critics were mainly ulama from his homeland, the Najd region of central Arabia, as well as scholars based in the cities of Basra, Mecca, and Medina.[^55] Some early opponents classified his doctrine as a "Kharijite sectarian heresy," comparing Wahhabism to the beliefs of the Kharijites, an early Islamic sect known for its extreme positions on excommunication.[^56]

One of the most controversial aspects of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings was his practice of takfir—the excommunication of Muslims whom he deemed to have strayed from true monotheism. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab declared those who adhered to practices like seeking aid from tombs of dead Muslim saints to be either infidels (kuffar) or false Muslims (munafiqun), and therefore deemed them worthy of death for their perceived apostasy (ridda).[^57] There are shared concepts between Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's ideology and modern jihadist movements, including "the practice of takfir—excommunication of other Muslims, as well as what Crawford calls 'secondary takfir'—the highly controversial gesture of excommunicating otherwise pious Muslims for not themselves excommunicating others."[^58]

According to some sources, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab wrote that those who would not conform to his view should be killed, their wives and daughters violated, and their possessions confiscated.[^59] The list of apostates meriting death included Shiites, Sufis, and other Muslim denominations whom Abd al-Wahhab did not consider to be Muslim at all.[^60] However, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab and his followers maintained they acted defensively, holding that they were victims of aggressive warfare and accusing their opponents of starting the pronouncements of takfir.[^61]

The destruction of shrines and sacred sites became one of the most visible and controversial manifestations of Wahhabi doctrine. Ibn Abd al-Wahhab persuaded local rulers to help him level tombs and destroy monuments because they violated a central tenet found in hadith stating that Muhammad had commanded the destruction of such shrines, as they tended to promote worship of human beings rather than the unitary divine.[^62] Because Wahhabism prohibits the veneration of shrines, tombs, and sacred objects, many sites associated with the early history of Islam, including homes and graves of companions of Muhammad, were demolished under Saudi rule.[^63] The Wahhabi movement staunchly denounced rituals related to the veneration of Muslim saints and pilgrimages to their tombs and shrines, which were widespread amongst the people of Najd.[^64]

The most dramatic expression of Wahhabi militancy occurred in the Wahhabi sack of Karbala in 1802-1803, a brutal event that shocked the Muslim world.[^65] After 1818, the Wahhabi ulema adopted certain legal views on migration (hijra), excommunication (takfir), and religious warfare (jihad) as core theological doctrines, though this was in stark contrast to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's own writings, in which jihad played a limited role in line with classical Islamic military jurisprudence.[^66]

Opposition to Ibn Abd al-Wahhab came even from within his own family. His brother, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab, was at loggerheads with him in terms of belief and became the most vocal among his contemporary critics.[^67] Sulayman wrote a significant refutation of his brother's work titled The Divine Lightning in Refutation of the Wahhabis (al-Sawa'iq al-Ilahiyya fi-l-Radd 'ala al-Wahhābiyya).[^68] The famous Hanafi jurist Ibn Abidin Shami labeled Ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a Khariji in his work 'Fatawa Shami.'[^69] The prominent scholar and Grand Mufti of Mecca, Shaykh al-Islam Ahmad Zayni Dahlan al-Shafi'i, authored two books titled 'Fitnatul Wahhabiyah' and 'Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah Fi Rad Al-Wahhabiyah' specifically to refute Wahhabi doctrines.[^70]

## Personal Life

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was married at the young age of twelve, as arranged by his father according to the customs of the time.[^71] During his travels to Baghdad, he married an affluent woman whose property he inherited when she died, providing him with financial independence that enabled his scholarly and missionary activities.[^72] He married one of his daughters to Muhammad ibn Saud, the tribal chief, further cementing the political-religious alliance between the two families.[^73]

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab had a large family, leaving behind four daughters and six sons.[^74] His sons—Husayn, Abd Allah, and Ibrahim—became judges after their father, continuing the family's tradition of religious scholarship and jurisprudence.[^75] A genealogical source lists additional children: Abdullah ibn Muhammad, Hassan ibn Muhammad, Hussein ibn Muhammad (died 1809), Ali ibn Muhammad (died 1829), Ibrahim ibn Muhammad, and at least one daughter.[^76] Many of his sons became clerics of greater or lesser distinction, carrying forward their father's religious teachings.[^77]

Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's brother, Shaykh Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab, was at loggerheads with him in terms of belief and became one of his most vocal critics, writing refutations of his brother's theological positions.[^78] This family division illustrates the controversial nature of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings even among those closest to him.

Despite his significant religious and political influence, when Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab died, he did not leave behind any wealth, and nothing was distributed to his heirs.[^79] This detail suggests that he lived according to principles of religious asceticism and did not accumulate personal riches despite his position of authority. He fell ill and died in June 1792 CE (1206 AH) in the lunar month of Dhul-Qa'dah, at the age of eighty-nine.[^80] He was buried in an unmarked grave at al-Turayf in al-Dir'iyya, in accordance with Wahhabi principles that reject elaborate tombs and grave markers.[^81]

## Legacy

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab's most enduring legacy is the religio-political pact he forged with Muhammad bin Saud to establish the Emirate of Diriyah, the first Saudi state, which began a dynastic alliance and power-sharing arrangement between their families that continues to the present day in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.[^82] The descendants of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, known as the Al ash-Sheikh, became Saudi Arabia's leading religious family and have historically led the ulama in the Saudi state, dominating the state's clerical institutions.[^83]

The Al ash-Sheikh continued to hold a special position in the Saudi state throughout its history, which persists to the present day.[^84] The arrangement between the two families has been based on the Al Saud maintaining the Al ash-Sheikh's authority in religious matters and upholding and propagating Salafi doctrine, while in return, the Al ash-Sheikh support the Al Saud's political authority, thereby using their religious-moral authority to legitimize the royal family's rule.[^85]

For more than two centuries, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings were championed as the official creed in the three Saudi States.[^86] The Wahhabi movement gradually rose to prominence as an influential anti-colonial reform trend in the Islamic world that advocated the regeneration of the social and political prowess of Muslims.[^87] Vast wealth from oil discovered in the following decades, coupled with Saudi, and thus Wahhabi, control of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, fueled Wahhabi missionary activity worldwide.[^88]

However, by 2021, the waning power of the religious clerics brought about by social, economic, and political changes, and the Saudi government's promotion of a nationalist narrative that emphasizes non-Islamic components, led to what has been described as the "post-Wahhabi era" of Saudi Arabia.[^89] Saudi Arabia's annual commemoration of its founding day on February 22 since 2022, which marked the ascension of Muhammad ibn Saud in 1727 and de-emphasized his pact with Ibn Abd al-Wahhab in 1744, has led to the official "uncoupling" of the religious clergy by the Saudi state.[^90]

The relationship between Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's teachings and modern extremism remains deeply controversial and contested among scholars. Wahhabism's doctrines have been linked to extremist groups such as al-Qaeda and ISIS, which have committed violent acts in the name of their interpretation of Islam.[^91] Critics argue that Saudi funding has promoted an intolerant, fanatical form of Islam that several political scientists and scholars consider to be the core cause of Islamic extremism and religiously-motivated terrorism worldwide.[^92] Some scholars note shared concepts between Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's ideology and jihadist movements today, including the practice of takfir and the use of Islamic texts to justify armed violence.[^93]

However, many scholars dispute this connection, arguing that most contemporary jihadist terrorists are not adherents of Wahhabism, and the two categories are not synonymous.[^94] They contend that while there are firebrand Wahhabis who encourage contemporary jihadist terrorism, their hostility does not emanate from the doctrines of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's fundamentalist religious reform movement.[^95] These scholars emphasize that tawhid, not militant jihad, was the main focus of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's call for reform, and that its founder was a religious reformer, not a political ideologue.[^96] Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab defined armed jihad as a sacred endeavor that must have valid religious justification and which can only be declared by an Imam, with the purpose being to safeguard the community from aggression.[^97]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and defenders of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab view him as a legitimate Islamic reformer who sought to purify the faith from corrupting influences. Islamic scholar Yusuf al-Qaradawi praised Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a Mujaddid (religious reviver) of the Arabian Peninsula who defended the purity of tawhid from various superstitions and polytheistic beliefs.[^98] This perspective emphasizes his role in returning Muslims to what he and his followers considered the authentic sources of Islam—the Quran and Sunnah—free from later accretions and innovations.

Western scholar Natana J. DeLong-Bas offered a defense of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, stating that "despite his at times vehement denunciations of other religious groups for their supposedly heretical beliefs, Ibn Abd al Wahhab never called for their destruction or death."[^99] This view suggests that later violence associated with Wahhabism may have been a distortion of Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's original teachings rather than their natural consequence.

From the 19th century onward, prominent Arab Salafiyya reformers maintained correspondence with Wahhabis and defended them against Sufi attacks.[^100] During the early 19th century, Egyptian Muslim scholar al-Jabarti defended the Wahhabi movement.[^101] Notable defenders included Shihab al-Din al-Alusi, Abd al-Hamid al-Zahrawi, and most notably, Muhammad Rasheed Rida, who was considered the "leader of Salafis" and became one of the most prominent advocates for Wahhabi thought in the broader Muslim world.[^102]

Defenders argue that Ibn Abd al-Wahhab sought to revive and purify Islam from what he perceived as non-Islamic popular religious beliefs and practices by returning to what he believed were the fundamental principles of the Islamic religion.[^103] They emphasize his scholarly credentials, his mastery of various religious disciplines including Islamic fiqh (jurisprudence), theology, hadith sciences, and even Tasawwuf (Sufism), which he studied during his extensive travels.[^104] Supporters contend that his movement represented a legitimate response to the religious conditions of 18th-century Arabia, where practices had diverged significantly from scriptural sources.

### Negative Views

Critics of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab view his teachings as a dangerous departure from mainstream Islamic tradition that promoted intolerance and sectarianism. Scholars generally condemned Muhammed Ibn Abdul Wahab and his views as deviant and heretical.[^105] Wahhabism has been a source of controversy and conflict since its inception, with its adherents facing criticism for their extreme interpretations, excommunication of fellow Muslims, and legitimization of violence against dissenting voices.[^106] The testimonies of prominent Sunni scholars from various madhabs serve as a reminder of the diverse intellectual traditions within Islam and the rejection of Wahhabism's puritanical and violent tendencies by mainstream Islamic scholarship.[^107]

Some early opponents classified Ibn Abd al-Wahhab's doctrine as a "Kharijite sectarian heresy," comparing it to one of the earliest and most extreme sects in Islamic history known for declaring other Muslims apostates.[^108] Non-Wahhabi Sunnis have also compared Wahhabism to the beliefs of the Kharijites.[^109] The famous Hanafi jurist Ibn Abidin Shami labeled Ibn Abd al-Wahhab as a Khariji in his influential work 'Fatawa Shami.'[^110]

His own brother, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Wahhab, was one of his staunchest opponents and wrote a significant refutation titled The Divine Lightning in Refutation of the Wahhabis (al-Sawa'iq al-Ilahiyya fi-l-Radd 'ala al-Wahhabiyya).[^111] The prominent scholar and Grand Mufti of Mecca, Shaykh al-Islam Ahmad Zayni Dahlan al-Shafi'i, authored two entire books—'Fitnatul Wahhabiyah' and 'Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah Fi Rad Al-Wahhabiyah'—specifically to refute Wahhabi doctrines.[^112]

Critics accuse Ibn Abd al-Wahhab of disregarding Islamic history, monuments, traditions, and the sanctity of Muslim life.[^113] They point to his practice of takfir—declaring other Muslims to be apostates worthy of death—and his destruction of shrines and sacred sites as evidence of his extremism.[^114] The widespread demolition of sites associated with early Islamic history, including homes and graves of companions of Muhammad, under Wahhabi influence remains a source of deep resentment among many Muslims.[^115]

Modern critics link Wahhabism to contemporary extremism and terrorism. Some argue that there are many shared concepts between the ideology Ibn Abd al-Wahhab promoted and jihadist movements today, including the practice of takfir and the use of Islamic texts to justify violence.[^116] Research has analyzed how Muhammad Ibn Abd al-Wahhab used Islamic texts to theorize jihad against his fellow believers in the 18th century with nearly the same reasons driving Osama bin Laden and young Muslims toward jihadism two centuries later.[^117] Critics contend that Saudi funding of Wahhabism has promoted an intolerant form of Islam that has contributed to global extremism and religiously-motivated terrorism.[^118]
