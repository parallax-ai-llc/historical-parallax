## Summary

Jocelyn Bell Burnell is a British-Irish astrophysicist who, as a graduate student in 1967, discovered the first radio pulsars. This discovery was recognized by the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics, but controversially only her supervisor Antony Hewish and Martin Ryle received the award. Her discovery of pulsars is considered one of the greatest astronomical achievements of the 20th century. She has since become a leading figure in astrophysics and science policy.
