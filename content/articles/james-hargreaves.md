## Summary

James Hargreaves invented the spinning jenny around 1764, one of the key inventions of the Industrial Revolution. His machine allowed a single worker to operate eight spindles instead of one, dramatically increasing textile production. Although his neighbors destroyed his machines out of fear of unemployment, the spinning jenny spread rapidly.
