## Summary

Aung San Suu Kyi (born 1945) is a Burmese politician who became a global icon of democracy and human rights for her nonviolent resistance to Myanmar's military junta. Placed under house arrest for 15 of 21 years (1989-2010), she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (1991) for her "non-violent struggle for democracy and human rights." She led her National League for Democracy to landslide election victories and served as State Counsellor (2016-2021), Myanmar's de facto leader. However, her legacy became deeply controversial due to her defense of the military's brutal campaign against the Rohingya Muslim minority (2016-2017), widely condemned as ethnic cleansing or genocide. She is again under house arrest following the 2021 military coup.
