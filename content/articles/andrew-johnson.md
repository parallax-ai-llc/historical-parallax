## Summary

Andrew Johnson (1808-1875) served as the 17th President of the United States from 1865 to 1869, ascending to office after Abraham Lincoln's assassination. A self-taught former tailor from North Carolina who rose through Tennessee politics, Johnson was the only Southern senator to remain loyal to the Union during the Civil War. His presidency was defined by bitter conflicts with Congress over Reconstruction policy, opposition to civil rights for freed slaves, and his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868—missing conviction by a single Senate vote. Modern historians consistently rank Johnson among the worst American presidents, citing his racist policies, political incompetence, and obstruction of efforts to protect African Americans' rights.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Andrew Johnson was born on December 29, 1808, in Raleigh, North Carolina, into grinding poverty that would shape his entire worldview. He was the younger of two sons born to Jacob Johnson, who worked as a porter at a local inn, sexton in the Presbyterian church, and town constable, and Mary "Polly" McDonough Johnson, a seamstress and weaver. The family's precarious economic situation deteriorated further when Jacob Johnson died suddenly in 1812, shortly after Andrew's third birthday, following his heroic rescue of three drowning men. This left the widow Johnson to support her family through spinning and weaving, eventually remarrying a man named Turner Doughtry who was equally impoverished.[^4][^5]

Johnson never attended a single day of school, making him one of the few presidents without formal education. At age ten, his mother apprenticed him to James Selby, a tailor in Raleigh, where he would learn a trade that provided both livelihood and social gathering space throughout his early years. During his apprenticeship, some of Selby's customers would read to the tailors as they worked, providing Johnson with his first exposure to literature and public discourse. This rudimentary literacy instruction, combined with readings from his fellow workers, sparked an intellectual hunger that would never be fully satisfied.[^6][^7]

After approximately five years with Selby, the teenage Johnson and his brother William ran away from their indenture around 1824, prompting Selby to place a newspaper advertisement offering a $10 reward for their return. The brothers fled westward, working as itinerant tailors in various frontier towns. In 1826, when Andrew had just turned 17, having permanently broken his indenture, he and his entire family relocated to Greeneville, Tennessee, in the mountainous eastern part of the state. There, Johnson opened his own tailor shop with a simple sign reading "A. Johnson, Tailor," establishing himself in a community where he would build both his livelihood and political base.[^8][^9]

In 1827, Johnson married 16-year-old Eliza McCardle, the daughter of a shoemaker, who recognized potential in the young tailor. Eliza became instrumental in Johnson's self-education, teaching him writing and arithmetic while he already possessed basic reading skills. She would read to him while he worked at his tailoring, helping him develop the literacy and learning that he had been denied as a child. Johnson later paid people to read to him in his shop, which became a gathering place for working-class men to discuss politics and current events. This informal education, combined with his natural oratorical abilities and combative temperament, prepared him for a political career built on championing the common man against aristocratic elites.[^10][^11][^12]

---

## Rise to Power

Johnson's political ascent began at the grassroots level in Greeneville, where his tailor shop served as both a business and a de facto political club for working-class citizens. Before he turned 21, Johnson organized a workingman's party that successfully challenged the established order, leading to his election as an alderman in 1829. This initial success sparked a remarkable string of electoral victories: he served repeatedly as alderman throughout the early 1830s and was elected mayor of Greeneville twice during this period. These local positions allowed Johnson to develop his political philosophy centered on defending small farmers and laborers against what he perceived as the tyranny of wealthy landowners and aristocrats.[^13][^14]

In 1835, Johnson made the leap to state politics, winning election to the Tennessee House of Representatives. During his eight years in the state legislature (serving until 1843), he found a natural home in the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, whose populist rhetoric and states' rights philosophy resonated with Johnson's own beliefs. He emerged as a fierce advocate for the working class and mountaineers of East Tennessee, often clashing with representatives of the plantation-owning elites in Middle and West Tennessee. His political style was confrontational and uncompromising, earning him both devoted followers and bitter enemies.[^15][^16]

Johnson's growing reputation as a fighter for common people propelled him to Congress. In 1843, he won election to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he would serve five consecutive two-year terms. During his decade in the House, Johnson became known for his passionate advocacy of the Homestead Bill, legislation that would provide free land to settlers—a cause that aligned perfectly with his vision of expanding opportunities for working-class Americans. His speaking style was direct and often aggressive, reflecting his background as a self-made man who had clawed his way up from poverty without benefit of education or family connections.[^17][^18]

After the Tennessee legislature gerrymandered his congressional district in 1853 to diminish his chances for reelection, Johnson pivoted to seek the governorship. He won the governor's race that year and again in 1855, serving as Tennessee's chief executive from 1853 to 1857. As governor, Johnson championed public education, overseeing the enactment of Tennessee's first law levying taxes to finance public schools—an ironic achievement for a man who had never attended school himself. In 1857, the Tennessee legislature elected him to the U.S. Senate, where he generally aligned with dominant Democratic positions favoring lower tariffs and opposing abolitionist agitation.[^19][^20][^21]

The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and the subsequent secession crisis created Johnson's defining moment. When Tennessee voted to leave the Union in June 1861, Johnson made the extraordinary decision to remain in his Senate seat, becoming the only senator from a seceding state to maintain his loyalty to the United States. This act of political courage—or stubbornness, as critics suggested—made him a hero in the North and a traitor in much of the South. In March 1862, President Lincoln appointed Johnson as military governor of Tennessee with the rank of brigadier general, tasking him with restoring federal authority and civil government in the occupied portions of the state. For three years, Johnson ruled Tennessee with an iron hand, arresting Confederate sympathizers, jailing ministers who refused loyalty oaths, and using dictatorial methods to suppress opposition. This demonstration of unwavering Union loyalty, combined with his Southern background and Democratic affiliation, made him an attractive running mate for Lincoln's 1864 reelection campaign under the National Union Party banner.[^22][^23][^24][^25]

## Major Achievements

Andrew Johnson's presidency is notable more for controversies than achievements, yet several significant developments occurred during his administration, though often despite rather than because of his efforts. The most substantial accomplishment associated with Johnson's tenure was the Alaska Purchase of 1867, negotiated primarily by Secretary of State William H. Seward. On March 30, 1867, Seward concluded negotiations with Russian minister Edouard de Stoeckl to purchase Russian holdings in North America for $7.2 million—approximately two cents per acre. The Senate approved the treaty on April 9, 1867, and President Johnson signed it on May 28, 1867, with the formal transfer occurring on October 18, 1867. This acquisition of 586,412 square miles ended Russia's presence in North America and secured U.S. access to the Pacific northern rim, though contemporaries derided it as "Seward's Folly" and "Andrew Johnson's Polar Bear Garden." The animosity toward the purchase partly reflected Johnson's own deep unpopularity.[^26][^27][^28]

During Johnson's administration, the United States achieved several foreign policy successes largely due to Seward's diplomatic skill. Although Johnson's presidency was marked by chaos and administrative incompetence on domestic fronts, Seward managed foreign affairs ably, maintaining American interests during a turbulent period. The purchase of Alaska proved strategically invaluable in the twentieth century, providing resources, military positioning, and eventually statehood, vindicating Seward's vision if not contemporary opinion.[^29][^30]

On the domestic front, Johnson's "achievements" were largely negative—actions he opposed that Congress accomplished over his vetoes. The Reconstruction Acts of 1867, passed over Johnson's veto, divided the former Confederacy into five military districts and established procedures for readmitting states to the Union, requiring new state constitutions guaranteeing black suffrage and ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourteenth Amendment itself, which Johnson vigorously opposed and openly called for states to reject, became one of the most important additions to the Constitution, establishing citizenship for all persons born in the United States and guaranteeing equal protection under law. Johnson's opposition to this fundamental civil rights measure became a primary count against him in historical assessments.[^31][^32][^33]

The Freedmen's Bureau, established in 1865 before Johnson's presidency, continued its work providing assistance to formerly enslaved people despite Johnson's attempts to limit its scope. Congress passed the Freedmen's Bureau Bill in 1866 to extend and expand the agency's work, but Johnson vetoed it. Congress later passed a modified version over his veto. Similarly, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, which granted citizenship and equal rights to African Americans, became law over Johnson's veto after both the Senate (April 6) and House (April 9) overrode his objections. These legislative accomplishments occurred not because of presidential leadership but in spite of fierce presidential opposition.[^34][^35][^36]

Johnson did complete the restoration of the Union in a technical sense, as all former Confederate states were readmitted during or shortly after his presidency, though the terms and conditions of readmission were dictated by Congress against his wishes. He also granted extensive pardons and amnesty to former Confederates, ultimately pardoning nearly all who had participated in the rebellion—an act of leniency that his supporters praised as magnanimous but critics condemned as enabling the resurrection of white supremacist power structures.[^37][^38]

The Johnson administration oversaw continued westward expansion and infrastructure development, including the continuation of transcontinental railroad construction begun under Lincoln. However, these developments largely proceeded through congressional legislation and private enterprise rather than presidential initiative. Johnson's approach to governance emphasized limited federal power and states' rights, which in practice meant minimal presidential leadership on most issues beyond his obsessive opposition to Reconstruction measures.[^39][^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Andrew Johnson's presidency was engulfed in controversy from its inception, with his very first appearance as vice president setting an inauspicious tone. On March 4, 1865, Johnson delivered a rambling, apparently intoxicated inaugural address that shocked and embarrassed those present. Though Johnson later claimed he had been ill and that medicinal whiskey had affected him more than expected, the incident damaged his reputation and provided ammunition for critics who would later question his fitness for office. Six weeks later, Lincoln's assassination thrust this controversial figure into the presidency at the nation's most critical juncture.[^41][^42]

Johnson's approach to Reconstruction immediately generated fierce opposition. His Presidential Reconstruction plan, implemented in 1865 through executive proclamations while Congress was in recess, offered generous terms to former Confederates. He granted amnesty to most white Southerners who took a loyalty oath, with only high Confederate officials and wealthy planters initially excluded—though Johnson liberally granted individual pardons even to these groups. Under his appointed provisional governors, Southern states drafted new constitutions that abolished slavery and repudiated secession debts, but otherwise left the existing white power structure intact. Most controversially, all land confiscated by the Union Army and distributed to formerly enslaved people reverted to its prewar owners, reversing Sherman's "forty acres and a mule" orders and destroying freedpeople's hopes for economic independence.[^43][^44][^45]

The Southern states reconstructed under Johnson's plan promptly enacted "Black Codes"—laws designed to maintain white supremacy and control Black labor. Mississippi and South Carolina passed particularly egregious codes that severely restricted African Americans' freedom of movement, employment options, property rights, and civil liberties. These laws attempted to recreate slavery in all but name, forcing freedpeople into labor contracts under threat of arrest for "vagrancy," prohibiting them from owning firearms, and denying them the right to testify against white people in court. Rather than opposing these measures, Johnson's lenient Reconstruction plan enabled them, and he resisted congressional efforts to protect Black civil rights.[^46][^47][^48]

Johnson's racial views were explicit and extreme even by the standards of his era. He reportedly declared, "This is a country for white men, and as long as I am president, it shall be a government for white men." He openly opposed granting African Americans the right to vote, arguing that it would lead to "race war" and societal collapse. His opposition to Black civil rights was not merely political calculation but reflected deep-seated racist beliefs that he expressed freely in private and public communications. Modern historians identify Johnson's virulent racism as central to his failure as president and to the broader failure of Reconstruction to achieve racial justice.[^49][^50][^51]

The conflict between Johnson and Congress escalated throughout his presidency. Johnson vetoed 29 pieces of legislation during his term—more than any previous president—and Congress overrode 15 of these vetoes, an unprecedented rejection of presidential authority. His vetoes of the Freedmen's Bureau Bill, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and all four Reconstruction Acts demonstrated his determination to obstruct congressional Reconstruction policy. Johnson's veto messages often contained inflammatory rhetoric attacking Congress and questioning its constitutional authority, poisoning any possibility of compromise or cooperation.[^52][^53][^54]

The crisis came to a head with Johnson's violation of the Tenure of Office Act, a law passed by Congress in 1867 over his veto that prohibited the president from removing certain officeholders without Senate approval. On February 21, 1868, Johnson attempted to remove Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a Radical Republican ally, without Senate consent. This action provided the immediate pretext for impeachment. On February 24, 1868, the House of Representatives voted to impeach Johnson for "high crimes and misdemeanors," and on March 2-3, approved eleven articles of impeachment focused primarily on his violation of the Tenure of Office Act and his inflammatory attacks on Congress.[^55][^56][^57]

The impeachment trial in the Senate lasted from March to May 1868. While the formal charges centered on technical violations of the Tenure of Office Act (which the Supreme Court later declared unconstitutional in 1926), the real issue was Johnson's obstruction of Reconstruction and his attempts to sabotage Congress's constitutional authority. Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens criticized the impeachment articles as too lenient, declaring, "Never was so great a malefactor so gently treated as Andrew Johnson." Representative William D. Kelley captured the moral stakes: "Sir, the bloody and untilled fields of the ten unreconstructed states, the unsheeted ghosts of the two thousand murdered negroes in Texas, cry, if the dead ever evoke vengeance, for the punishment of Andrew Johnson."[^58][^59][^60]

On May 16 and May 26, 1868, the Senate voted on conviction, with 35 senators voting guilty and 19 not guilty—one vote short of the two-thirds majority required for removal. Seven Republican senators voted to acquit, some questioning whether the Tenure of Office Act applied to Stanton (who had been appointed by Lincoln, not Johnson) and whether Johnson's actions constituted genuine high crimes rather than political disagreements. The impeachment's failure to convict did not vindicate Johnson; rather, it left him as a powerless lame duck for his remaining months in office, achieving none of his policy goals and becoming the first president to be impeached.[^61][^62][^63]

## Personal Life

Andrew Johnson married Eliza McCardle on May 17, 1827, when he was 18 and she was 16. Their marriage lasted 48 years until Johnson's death, though it was marked by long separations due to his political career and by Eliza's chronic illness. Eliza suffered from tuberculosis and spent much of her adult life as a semi-invalid, rarely appearing in public and keeping to her room for extended periods. Despite her illness, she was intellectually sharp and politically astute, serving as Johnson's tutor in his youth and his advisor throughout his career. Her contributions to his rise from illiterate tailor to president were invaluable, though often overlooked by contemporaries and historians.[^64][^65][^66]

The Johnsons had five children: Martha (born 1828), Charles (born 1830), Mary (born 1832), Robert (born 1834), and Andrew Jr. (born 1852). Tragedy struck the family when Charles died in a horseback riding accident in 1863 at age 33, and Robert died of alcoholism in 1869 at age 35. During Johnson's presidency, Eliza's poor health prevented her from serving as White House hostess, so their daughters Martha Johnson Patterson and Mary Johnson Stover assumed these duties. Martha, the eldest, became the de facto First Lady, managing the White House household with dignity despite the political firestorm surrounding her father. Their youngest son, Andrew Jr., attempted journalism after the war, founding the Greeneville Intelligencer, which failed after two years; he died in 1879 at age 27.[^67][^68][^69]

Johnson's relationship with slavery and enslaved people revealed contradictions in his character. Despite his rhetoric as a champion of working people, Johnson owned enslaved individuals. He purchased a woman named Dolly and her children—Liz, Florence, and William—and also bought Dolly's half-brother Sam. Sam and his wife Margaret had nine children while enslaved by Johnson. Johnson freed his slaves on August 8, 1863, during his tenure as military governor of Tennessee, and they remained with him afterward as paid servants. This act of emancipation came not from moral conviction against slavery but from political necessity, as Johnson had long defended the institution as constitutional and beneficial. His ownership of enslaved people while championing "white men's democracy" epitomized the racial contradictions of his worldview.[^70][^71][^72]

Johnson's personality was marked by stubbornness, combativeness, and an inability to compromise. He saw political opponents as enemies to be defeated rather than fellow citizens with different views. His rigidity stemmed partly from his impoverished background and lack of formal education, which left him with a perpetual sense of grievance against educated elites and a fierce determination to prove himself their equal. Unlike Lincoln, who possessed remarkable skills in reading and molding public opinion, Johnson was tone-deaf to political realities and alienated potential allies through his confrontational style. His personal courage was undeniable—his refusal to abandon the Union in 1861 required genuine bravery—but courage without wisdom or flexibility proved disastrous in the presidency.[^73][^74][^75]

In his private life, Johnson was known for his work ethic and simple tastes. Even as president, he remarked that he still knew how to sew a coat, maintaining pride in his tailoring skills. He was not particularly social, preferring work to entertaining, and his White House was notably somber compared to earlier administrations. Johnson never acquired the polish or sophistication of formally educated politicians, and he seemed to wear his rough edges as badges of honor rather than attempting to smooth them. This authenticity appealed to his supporters, who saw him as a genuine man of the people, but repelled others who found him crude and unsuited for high office.[^76][^77]

## Legacy

Andrew Johnson left a legacy of failure, obstruction, and missed opportunities that historians consistently rank among the worst in presidential history. His presidency occurred at the single most important moment for determining race relations in America—the immediate aftermath of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery—and he used his power to obstruct rather than advance racial justice. Johnson's strong commitment to blocking political and civil rights for African Americans is considered principally responsible for Reconstruction's failure to solve the race problem in the South and perhaps in America as a whole. His actions extended the period of national strife and racial oppression rather than healing the wounds of war.[^78][^79][^80]

The immediate consequences of Johnson's policies were catastrophic for Black Americans in the South. His lenient approach allowed former Confederate leaders to regain power quickly, his opposition to land redistribution left freedpeople economically dependent on their former enslavers, and his obstruction of civil rights legislation enabled the creation of Jim Crow systems that would oppress Black Americans for a century. While Congress eventually overrode many of Johnson's vetoes and passed landmark civil rights legislation, the delay and presidential opposition emboldened white supremacists and undermined enforcement efforts. The violence and terrorism directed against Black people during Johnson's presidency, which he did nothing to stop and arguably encouraged through his rhetoric, set patterns of racial violence that persisted for generations.[^81][^82][^83]

Johnson's impeachment established important constitutional precedents, though not the ones he might have hoped. While he survived conviction by a single vote, the impeachment demonstrated Congress's willingness to check a president who exceeded his authority and obstructed the law. The failure to convict has been debated by historians, with some arguing that it preserved the separation of powers and prevented impeachment from becoming a parliamentary-style vote of no confidence, while others contend that Johnson's acquittal weakened accountability for presidential misconduct. The Tenure of Office Act, which provided the formal basis for impeachment, was eventually declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1926, suggesting that the technical charges were indeed questionable—though the underlying political and moral issues remained valid.[^84][^85][^86]

Johnson's political legacy was personal failure. After leaving the presidency in 1869, he attempted to return to public office, running unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1869 and for the House in 1872. Finally, in 1874, the Tennessee legislature elected him to the Senate, making him the only former president to serve in that body. He returned to Washington in March 1875 and delivered a speech attacking President Grant's Reconstruction policies, demonstrating that he had learned nothing from his presidential failures. Just months later, on July 31, 1875, Johnson suffered a stroke at his daughter's home in Elizabethton, Tennessee, and died at age 66. He was buried on August 3, 1875, at his property on Signal Hill near Greeneville, wrapped in an American flag with a copy of the Constitution placed under his head as he had requested—a final ironic gesture given his disregard for constitutional rights for millions of Americans.[^87][^88][^89][^90]

The evolution of Johnson's historical reputation reveals changing American attitudes toward race and Reconstruction. From the 1870s through the early twentieth century, many historians—influenced by the "Dunning School" of Reconstruction historiography that accepted white supremacist premises—viewed Johnson favorably as a courageous president who resisted congressional overreach and protected constitutional principles. He enjoyed high regard as a strong-willed leader who took the high ground in challenging Congress's unconstitutional usurpation of presidential authority. This sympathetic interpretation dominated academic discourse until World War II.[^91][^92]

The civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s fundamentally transformed historical assessment of Johnson and Reconstruction. As American society grappled with ongoing racial injustice and recognized the continuities between slavery, Jim Crow, and modern racism, historians reexamined the Reconstruction era with new critical perspectives. This revisionist scholarship condemned Johnson's obstruction of Black civil rights and exposed how his policies enabled white supremacist violence and oppression. Modern historians universally recognize Johnson as the worst possible person to have served as president at the end of the Civil War—a rigid, dictatorial racist unable to compromise or accept political reality, driven by visceral emotions and implacable racism, and utterly lacking Lincoln's political skills.[^93][^94][^95]

Contemporary scholarly rankings place Johnson consistently among the worst presidents in American history. In presidential ranking surveys conducted by historians and political scientists, Johnson appears in the bottom tier alongside James Buchanan, Warren Harding, and Franklin Pierce. A 2010 Siena College survey ranked him as the worst president in history, while C-SPAN's 2021 survey placed him second-worst, just ahead of Buchanan. His scores are particularly low in categories relating to moral authority, equality, and pursued equal justice for all. The scholarly consensus is overwhelming: Johnson's gross incompetence in federal office, incredible miscalculation of public support for his policies, and commitment to white supremacy made him a catastrophic failure whose presidency inflicted lasting damage on the nation.[^96][^97][^98][^99]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Finding historians willing to defend Andrew Johnson has become increasingly difficult in recent decades, as scholarly consensus has solidified around viewing his presidency as a disaster. However, some defenders and contextual perspectives exist. During his lifetime and for several decades after, many Democrats and conservative scholars praised Johnson's commitment to limited government, states' rights, and constitutional restraint. They argued that he correctly interpreted the Constitution as limiting federal power to interfere in state affairs, and that his opposition to Radical Reconstruction prevented even greater federal overreach. These defenders portrayed Johnson as a principled leader who stood firm against congressional tyranny, sacrificing his political future to defend constitutional principles.[^100][^101]

Some historians have noted Johnson's genuine courage in remaining loyal to the Union when Tennessee seceded, an act that required real bravery and put his life at risk. His service as military governor of Tennessee demonstrated effectiveness in a difficult role, even if his methods were often harsh. Defenders argue that his common-man background and self-made success story embodied American democratic ideals, showing that the highest office was accessible even to the poorest and least educated citizens. His advocacy for the Homestead Act and public education during his earlier career showed genuine concern for expanding opportunities for working people.[^102][^103]

A few scholars have suggested that Johnson's failures stemmed more from political incompetence and inflexibility than from malice, and that his racism, while extreme, was not unusual for his time and region. They argue that even a more skilled president would have struggled with the unprecedented challenges of Reconstruction, and that some conflict with Congress was inevitable given the fundamental disagreements about federal power and race relations. Some defenders contend that Johnson's lenient approach to former Confederates promoted reconciliation and prevented prolonged guerrilla warfare, though critics counter that this "reconciliation" came at the expense of justice for African Americans.[^104][^105]

A minority perspective suggests that the constitutional questions raised by Johnson's impeachment were legitimate—that Congress did overreach in some Reconstruction legislation and that the Tenure of Office Act was indeed unconstitutional (as the Supreme Court later confirmed). Seven Republican senators voted to acquit Johnson, not because they approved of his policies but because they questioned whether his actions constituted genuine high crimes and misdemeanors warranting removal. These senators' reasoning suggested concerns about turning impeachment into a parliamentary vote of no confidence rather than a remedy for genuine criminal conduct.[^106][^107]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming scholarly consensus condemns Andrew Johnson as one of the worst presidents in American history, with criticism focusing on his racism, political incompetence, and obstruction of justice for African Americans. Modern historians view him as a catastrophic failure who did more to extend national strife than heal the wounds of war. His gross incompetence in federal office and incredible miscalculation of public support for his policies made him the worst possible person to serve as president at the Civil War's end. Senator Charles Sumner's contemporary assessment remains apt: Johnson was "the impersonation of the tyrannical slave power" whose "attempt to substitute himself for Congress in the work of reconstruction was sheer usurpation."[^108][^109][^110]

Historians condemn Johnson's virulent racism as central to his failures. His explicit commitment to maintaining white supremacy—his declaration that "this is a country for white men"—guided all his policy decisions. He actively obstructed efforts to protect Black civil rights, vetoing the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Freedmen's Bureau expansion, and all Reconstruction legislation. His opposition to the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship and equal protection to all persons born in the United States, stands as one of the most shameful presidential positions in American history. Scholars identify Johnson's implacable racism as principally responsible for Reconstruction's failure to solve America's race problem.[^111][^112][^113]

Johnson's political incompetence compounded his moral failures. Unlike Lincoln, who possessed remarkable skill in reading and molding public opinion, building coalitions, and finding compromise, Johnson was tone-deaf to political reality, alienated potential allies, and refused any compromise. He was rigid, dictatorial, and driven by visceral emotions rather than strategic thinking. His confrontational style and inflammatory rhetoric made enemies where he might have found partners, and his stubborn adherence to failed policies even when overwhelming evidence showed them unworkable demonstrated an inability to learn or adapt. Modern scholarship portrays him as willfully self-destructive, sabotaging his own presidency through political ineptitude.[^114][^115][^116]

Critics emphasize the concrete harms Johnson's policies inflicted on African Americans. His Presidential Reconstruction plan allowed Southern states to enact Black Codes that nearly recreated slavery, permitted former Confederate leaders to regain power immediately, and reversed land redistribution that might have provided economic foundation for Black freedom. Violence against African Americans surged during his presidency while Johnson did nothing to stop it and arguably encouraged it through his rhetoric. Representative William D. Kelley's impeachment speech captured the moral indictment: "the bloody and untilled fields of the ten unreconstructed states, the unsheeted ghosts of the two thousand murdered negroes in Texas, cry, if the dead ever evoke vengeance, for the punishment of Andrew Johnson."[^117][^118][^119]

Historians note that Johnson's legacy extended far beyond his presidency. The failure of Reconstruction to achieve racial justice—a failure Johnson worked actively to ensure—enabled the rise of Jim Crow segregation, disfranchisement, and racial terrorism that oppressed Black Americans for a century. While many factors contributed to Reconstruction's failure, Johnson's obstruction during the critical first years after the war, when possibilities for fundamental change were greatest, proved decisive. His presidency offers a striking example of presidential power to set political debate terms and to do lasting harm through both action and inaction. Had Lincoln lived, or had a different person succeeded him, the entire trajectory of American race relations might have been different. Instead, Johnson's racism and incompetence helped enshrine white supremacy for generations.[^120][^121][^122]

> "Honest conviction is my courage; the Constitution is my guide." - Johnson's self-assessment of his principled stance, though historians note his interpretation of the Constitution conveniently excluded protections for Black citizens.[^126]

> "There are no good laws but such as repeal other laws." - Expressing his philosophy of minimal government, which in practice meant opposing Reconstruction legislation designed to protect civil rights.[^127]

> "If man is not capable, and is not to be trusted with the government of himself, is he to be trusted with the government of others? The answer must be, Man - for we have no angels in the shape of men, as yet, who are willing to take charge of our political affairs." - From his defense of democratic self-governance, though he excluded African Americans from his vision of "man."[^128]

> "Duties have been mine; consequences are God's." - Johnson's fatalistic view of his presidential responsibilities, suggesting he felt no accountability for the disastrous consequences of his policies.[^129]
