## Summary

Yi Sang was a Korean modernist writer and architect whose experimental poetry and fiction were decades ahead of their time. His works, including the poem Crow's Eye View and the novella Wings, employ stream-of-consciousness, mathematical symbols, and surreal imagery. He died of tuberculosis in Tokyo at age 26 but left an enduring legacy as Korea's most avant-garde writer.
