## Summary

Captain James Cook (1728-1779) was a British Royal Navy explorer, navigator, and cartographer who conducted three groundbreaking expeditions to the Pacific Ocean (1768-71, 1772-75, 1776-79), fundamentally transforming European knowledge of the world's geography. Born to a Scottish farmhand in Yorkshire, Cook rose from humble origins to become one of history's greatest maritime explorers, mapping vast stretches of the Pacific including New Zealand, Australia's east coast, Hawaii, and portions of Antarctica and the Arctic. His precise cartographic work, astronomical observations, and naval innovations—particularly in preventing scurvy—set new standards for exploration and scientific discovery. However, his legacy remains deeply contested, with indigenous peoples viewing him as a symbol of colonial violence and dispossession, while his expeditions laid the foundations for British imperial expansion across the Pacific. Cook died at Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, on February 14, 1779, in a violent confrontation with native Hawaiians, bringing to an abrupt end a career that had peacefully changed the map of the world more than any other single person in history.[^1][^2]

## Early Life and Background

James Cook was born on October 27, 1728 (November 7 by the New Style calendar) at Marton-in-Cleveland, Yorkshire, England, the son of James Cook, a Scottish laborer who had migrated from Scotland following the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, and Grace Pace, a local Yorkshire woman.[^3][^4] He was the second of eight children, four of whom died in childhood, growing up in modest circumstances typical of rural agricultural families of the period. His father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, a local landowner, recognized young James's potential and paid for his schooling at the village school in Great Ayton, where the family had relocated when Cook was still a child.[^5][^6]

After five years of formal education—a considerable privilege for someone of his social class—Cook began work at age 12 for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager on Skottowe's estate.[^7] This early education provided Cook with basic literacy and numeracy, foundational skills that would prove essential in his later career. At 16, Cook moved twenty miles to the fishing village of Staithes on the North Sea coast to work as a shopboy for grocer and haberdasher William Sanderson.[^8] The position exposed him to the maritime world, and after eighteen months, with the consent of all concerned, he abandoned the retail trade for what he found to be a far more enticing apprenticeship.

In 1746, Cook was apprenticed to John Walker, a prominent Quaker shipowner and coal-shipper in the bustling port of Whitby.[^9][^10] This decision would prove transformative. The Walker family took a personal interest in their young apprentice's development, and Cook thrived in Whitby's demanding maritime environment. He served aboard coal-carrying vessels—colliers—sailing between the northeast coast of England and London, navigating some of Britain's most treacherous coastal waters characterized by shifting shoals, uncharted banks and shallows, and difficult harbors.[^11] This proved an invaluable training ground, developing the exceptional seamanship and navigational skills that would later distinguish Cook's career.

During his apprenticeship and subsequent employment with the Walkers, Cook applied himself with characteristic diligence to the study of algebra, geometry, trigonometry, navigation, and astronomy—all essential disciplines for commanding a ship.[^12] He progressed steadily through the ranks of the merchant marine, and by the early 1750s seemed destined for a comfortable career as a merchant captain. The Walkers offered him command of a vessel, a significant opportunity for a man of his background. However, in June 1755, at age 26, Cook made an unexpected decision that surprised his employers: he volunteered as an ordinary seaman in the Royal Navy, accepting a dramatic reduction in status and pay to pursue what he evidently saw as greater opportunities for advancement and adventure.[^13]

## Rise to Power

Cook's decision to join the Royal Navy on June 17, 1755, coincided with the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, a global conflict that would provide ample opportunity for a talented and ambitious seaman to distinguish himself.[^14] He enlisted as an able seaman aboard HMS Eagle, a 60-gun fourth-rate ship of the line commanded by Captain Hugh Palliser.[^15] Cook's exceptional skills and previous merchant navy experience quickly became apparent, and he advanced rapidly through the ranks, becoming master's mate by 1757.

In 1757, Cook passed his master's examinations, a significant achievement that qualified him to navigate and pilot Royal Navy vessels.[^16] He was assigned to HMS Pembroke as ship's master, responsible for navigation. During the Seven Years' War, Cook participated in the naval campaign in North America, including the crucial Siege of Quebec in 1759. During this campaign, Cook surveyed and charted much of the entrance to the St. Lawrence River, producing detailed charts that enabled British forces to navigate the treacherous waterway and ultimately capture Quebec from the French.[^17] This work demonstrated Cook's exceptional surveying and cartographic abilities, bringing him to the attention of senior naval officers.

Following the Treaty of Paris in 1763, which ended the Seven Years' War, Cook was appointed Surveyor of Newfoundland, a position that occupied him for five seasons between 1763 and 1767.[^18][^19] Working from the schooner HMS Grenville, Cook systematically charted the island's coastline—the northwest coast in 1763-64, the south coast between the Burin Peninsula and Cape Ray in 1765-66, and the west coast in 1767. His surveys produced the first large-scale, accurate maps of Newfoundland's coasts, work of such precision that the charts remained in use for over a century. Indeed, the charts compiled by Cook proved more accurate than new charts produced by the Royal Navy one hundred years later.[^20][^21]

Cook's Newfoundland work also included significant astronomical observations. On August 5, 1766, he precisely recorded the start and end times of a solar eclipse, sending his results to English astronomer John Bevis.[^22] The Royal Society communicated these findings in 1767, and the longitude position Cook obtained was subsequently used in his published sailing directions for Newfoundland. This work brought Cook to the attention of the Royal Society, Britain's premier scientific institution, and the Admiralty recognized in Cook a rare combination of practical seamanship, scientific knowledge, and meticulous attention to detail.

In 1768, the Royal Society and the Admiralty sought a commander for an expedition to observe the transit of Venus from Tahiti—an astronomical event of critical scientific importance for calculating the size of the solar system. The Admiralty selected Cook, promoting him to lieutenant and placing him in command of HMS Endeavour, a converted Whitby collier similar to the vessels on which Cook had trained.[^23][^24] This appointment, extraordinary for someone of Cook's relatively modest rank and humble origins, reflected the high regard in which his superiors held his abilities. Cook was given secret instructions beyond the transit observation: to search for the hypothesized great southern continent, Terra Australis, believed to exist in the South Pacific to balance the landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere.[^25]

## Major Achievements

Cook's first voyage aboard HMS Endeavour (1768-1771) ranks among the most consequential maritime expeditions in history. The expedition successfully observed the transit of Venus from Tahiti on June 3, 1769, though atmospheric conditions created a haze around Venus that complicated precise measurements.[^26][^27] Nevertheless, the observations, combined with data from other global observation points, allowed Oxford astronomer Professor Thomas Hornsby to calculate a solar parallax of 8.78 arc seconds, remarkably close to the currently accepted value of 8.794148 arc seconds, representing a major advance in astronomical knowledge and the understanding of the solar system's scale.[^28]

Following the Venus transit, Cook opened sealed orders directing him to search for Terra Australis. He sailed south and west, becoming the first European to systematically chart the entire coastline of New Zealand's North and South Islands—a six-month endeavor that proved New Zealand was not part of a southern continent but rather comprised two main islands.[^29] Cook then sailed westward, making landfall on the southeastern coast of Australia on April 19, 1770. He charted the entire east coast, from Point Hicks to Cape York, claiming the territory for Britain as New South Wales.[^30]

On April 29, 1770, the Endeavour anchored in a bay Cook initially named "Sting-Ray Harbour" but later renamed Botany Bay after the extraordinary botanical specimens collected there by expedition naturalists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander.[^31][^32] In just six days at Botany Bay, Banks, Solander, and their assistants collected specimens of 132 plant species—the first scientific collection of Australian flora. The expedition ultimately returned with specimens representing an estimated 100 new families and 1,000 new species of plants, a scientific treasure trove that revolutionized European botanical knowledge.[^33]

Cook's second voyage (1772-1775) aboard HMS Resolution aimed to definitively establish whether Terra Australis existed. This expedition represented perhaps Cook's greatest navigational achievement. On January 17, 1773, Cook became the first European explorer to cross the Antarctic Circle at 66°33' South.[^34][^35] He crossed the Antarctic Circle three times during the voyage, reaching his farthest south on January 30, 1774, at latitude 71°10' South—farther south than any known navigator before him—where he encountered an impenetrable wall of ice.[^36] Though Cook never sighted the Antarctic mainland, he correctly concluded that if a polar landmass existed, it was a barren terrain of ice rather than the temperate, inhabited continent that theorists had imagined.

During this circumnavigation of Antarctica—a voyage covering approximately 100,000 kilometers—Cook also explored the South Pacific more thoroughly, visiting Easter Island, the Marquesas, Tahiti, Tonga, and discovering New Caledonia, Norfolk Island, and South Georgia.[^37] Critically, this voyage demonstrated Cook's mastery of preventing scurvy, the vitamin C deficiency disease that had devastated previous long-distance maritime expeditions. Cook's methods—maintaining scrupulous cleanliness, obtaining fresh provisions whenever possible, and providing antiscorbutic foods including sauerkraut, wort of malt, and citrus juice—resulted in extraordinarily low mortality rates.[^38][^39] Cook circumnavigated the world without losing a single man to scurvy, a revolutionary achievement that transformed the possibilities for long-distance sea travel.

The second voyage also represented a landmark in navigational technology. Cook tested four marine chronometers, including one designed by watchmaker Larcum Kendall based on John Harrison's revolutionary design, which provided the first accurate measurements of longitude ever taken in the Pacific.[^40] This technological advance, combined with Cook's systematic charting methods employing theodolites, plane tables, and sextants, produced maps of unprecedented accuracy that guided mariners for generations.[^41]

Cook's third and final voyage (1776-1779) aboard HMS Resolution and HMS Discovery sought to discover the Northwest Passage from the Pacific side.[^42] The expedition discovered the Hawaiian Islands in January 1778—a archipelago previously unknown to Europeans that would prove fateful for Cook.[^43] Sailing north, Cook systematically charted the northwest coast of North America from Oregon to Alaska, closing gaps in European knowledge and producing the first comprehensive maps of this coastline.[^44] He identified what became known as Cook Inlet in Alaska and, in a single expedition, determined the extent of Alaska and connected previous Russian explorations from the west with Spanish probes from the south.

In August 1778, Cook sailed through the Bering Strait into the Arctic Ocean, proceeding northeast along the Alaskan coast until halted by sea ice at 70°44' North latitude on August 18, 1778.[^45][^46] Cook described the ice barrier as "compact as a Wall and seemed to be ten or twelve feet high at least." Unable to find a navigable passage through the ice, Cook retreated south, planning to return the following summer. His detailed records of the ice edge in the Chukchi Sea provide the earliest historical baseline for Arctic sea ice extent, data that remains valuable for modern climate science research.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his navigational and scientific achievements, Cook's legacy is deeply controversial, particularly from indigenous perspectives. For many Aboriginal Australians, Māori, Hawaiians, and other Pacific peoples, Cook symbolizes the beginning of colonial invasion, cultural disruption, and dispossession that followed European contact.[^48][^49] From an Aboriginal perspective, Cook "remains the scapegoat for white invasion," though he personally bears responsibility for actions during his expeditions that modern standards recognize as violent and unjust.[^50]

Cook's first encounter with Indigenous Australians at Botany Bay in 1770 exemplified the problems that would characterize subsequent European-Indigenous relations. Cook clearly did not establish any meaningful dialogue, discussion, or gain consent before claiming the entire east coast of the Australian continent for Britain.[^51] This unilateral claim, based on the legal fiction of terra nullius (land belonging to no one), ignored the presence of Aboriginal peoples who had inhabited the continent for over 60,000 years and established complex systems of land management and ownership.

Cook's interactions with Māori in New Zealand began disastrously. On October 8, 1769, when Cook's expedition first landed at Tūranganui River (present-day Gisborne), a Ngāti Oneone leader named Te Maro was shot and killed by one of Cook's men.[^52][^53] The local people appear to have been performing a ceremonial challenge, but the Europeans interpreted this as an attack. Over the following days, additional Māori were wounded and killed in confused confrontations. In total, at least nine Māori were killed by Endeavour crew members during Cook's New Zealand visits, with others wounded.[^54] Cook reportedly regretted these bungled encounters and subsequently developed more sophisticated protocols for initial contact, but the damage to relations had been done.

Scholarly analysis reveals that Cook's behavior became increasingly punitive and violent over the course of his three voyages. Initially committed to introducing what he considered "British justice" to Indigenous peoples and fostering peaceful relations, Cook grew frustrated by Indigenous resistance to Western impositions and their refusal to embrace European norms.[^55][^56] This frustration manifested in escalating violence. During his third voyage particularly, Cook ordered harsh punishments, including flogging Hawaiians for petty theft and authorizing his men to beat locals for trivial reasons.[^57]

Cook's published accounts also perpetuated damaging racist stereotypes. For example, he falsely claimed that the Nuu-chah-nulth people of the Pacific Northwest were cannibals, a fabrication that functioned to construct an image of Indigenous peoples as "fearsome and uncivilized" and helped justify colonial interventions.[^58] Regarding Aboriginal Australians, while Cook wrote observations suggesting they were "far more happier than we Europeans" and "wholly unacquainted not only with the superfluous but the necessary Conveniences so much sought after in Europe," his actions and the colonial system his explorations enabled contradicted any respect these words might suggest.[^59]

Hawaiian scholar Haunani-Kay Trask offered one of the harshest modern assessments, describing Cook as "a syphilitic, tubercular racist" and criticizing him for introducing sexually transmitted diseases, capitalism, and Christianity to Hawaii.[^60] While historians debate the accuracy of specific characterizations, there is substantial evidence that Cook's expeditions did introduce epidemic diseases to previously unexposed populations, with devastating demographic consequences. Many Māori condemn Cook as a hostile invader, and during the 1969 bicentenary celebrations of Cook's voyages, Māori activists demanded acknowledgement of the Māori people that Cook's crew had killed.[^61]

In recent years, Cook memorials have become flashpoints for debates about colonial legacy. Around the 250th anniversary of Cook's first voyage, various Cook statues and monuments in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Hawaii were vandalized, and public calls emerged for their removal or modification.[^62][^63] In Victoria, British Columbia, a Cook statue was splashed with red paint in August 2020 and later toppled into the harbor in July 2021.[^64] In Sydney, police were deployed to protect a Cook statue during Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.[^65] Art historian Alice Proctor argues these controversies reflect a broader movement toward decolonization of museums and public spaces and resistance to colonialist historical narratives.[^66]

## Personal Life

On December 21, 1762, James Cook married Elizabeth Batts at St. Margaret's Church in Barking, Essex.[^67] Elizabeth was the daughter of Samuel Batts, keeper of the Bell Inn at Execution Dock in Wapping, London. At the time of their marriage, Elizabeth was 20 years old and Cook was 34, already establishing his reputation as a skilled surveyor in the Royal Navy.[^68] The marriage appears to have been affectionate, despite the prolonged separations imposed by Cook's career. During their 17-year marriage, they lived together for approximately only four years in total, with Cook spending the remainder at sea on his surveying and exploration work.[^69]

When not at sea, the Cook family lived in London's East End and attended St. Paul's Church, Shadwell, where their children were baptized.[^70] The couple had six children: James (1763-1794), Nathaniel (1764-1780), Elizabeth (1767-1771), Joseph (1768-1768), George (1772-1772), and Hugh (1776-1793).[^71] Tragically, three children died in infancy—Joseph at one month old, George at four months, and their only daughter Elizabeth at age four. The family's sorrows would compound dramatically after Cook's death.

Captain Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779 marked the beginning of a devastating series of losses for Elizabeth Cook. Eight months after learning of her husband's death, she received news that their 15-year-old son Nathaniel had been lost at sea when HMS Thunderer foundered with all hands in a hurricane in the West Indies in 1780.[^72] In December 1793 and January 1794, Elizabeth's two remaining adult sons died within weeks of one another: Hugh, age 17, succumbed to scarlet fever while a student at Christ's College, Cambridge, and James, age 31 and a Commander in the Royal Navy, drowned.[^73]

Elizabeth Cook lived for more than 50 years as a widow, surviving until May 13, 1835, when she died at age 93.[^74] She outlived her husband by 56 years and all six of her children. As a result, Captain Cook has no known direct descendants; all of Elizabeth's recorded children predeceased her and died without issue.[^75] Elizabeth's story of prolonged grief and loss adds a poignant human dimension to Cook's legacy, illustrating the personal costs of the age of exploration for families left behind.

Accounts from those who knew Cook suggest a complex personality. He was known for his discipline, attention to detail, and demanding standards—characteristics essential to his success as an explorer but which could manifest as harsh treatment of subordinates. Shipboard journals describe Cook as generally fair-minded but increasingly prone to anger and harsh punishments during his final voyage, possibly due to declining health or the cumulative stress of years at sea.[^76] His relationship with Joseph Banks, the wealthy naturalist who accompanied the first voyage, was initially cordial but became strained, and Banks declined to join the second voyage following disputes over accommodations and authority.[^77]

## Legacy

James Cook's impact on global geography, navigation, and scientific exploration remains profound and multifaceted. He fundamentally transformed European understanding of global geography, peacefully changing the map of the world more than any other single person in history.[^78] His systematic charting of New Zealand, Australia's east coast, numerous Pacific islands, portions of North America's northwest coast, and pioneering explorations of Antarctic and Arctic waters created an unprecedented cartographic legacy. The precision of his maps was revolutionary; charts he produced in the 1760s of Newfoundland remained more accurate than new charts produced a century later.[^79]

Cook's navigational innovations extended beyond mapping. He pioneered the use of marine chronometers for determining longitude at sea, solving what had been one of navigation's greatest challenges.[^80] His mastery of astronomical navigation, combined with meticulous use of theodolites, plane tables, and sextants, established new standards for maritime surveying. These techniques and the charts they produced guided subsequent explorers for generations. When Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition ended in disaster in 1916, Shackleton's successful rescue navigation to South Georgia and subsequent overland trek to Stromness whaling station were made possible by Cook's detailed 1775 charting of South Georgia's coastline.[^81]

Cook's contributions to maritime health revolutionized long-distance sea travel. His success in preventing scurvy through scrupulous shipboard hygiene, procurement of fresh provisions, and systematic use of antiscorbutic foods saved countless lives and expanded the possibilities for extended voyages.[^82] In 1775, the Royal Society elected Cook as a Fellow and awarded him the Copley Gold Medal for his paper on combating scurvy, recognizing this achievement as among his most important contributions.[^83] His election certificate described him as "a gentleman skilfull in astronomy, & the successful conductor of two important voyages for the discovery of unknown countries, by which geography & natural history have been greatly advantaged and improved."[^84]

The scientific legacy of Cook's expeditions extends far beyond navigation and health. The botanical specimens collected by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander during the first voyage—representing an estimated 1,000 new species—revolutionized European botany and natural history.[^85] Cook's expeditions documented flora, fauna, and indigenous cultures with unprecedented systematic rigor, establishing models for scientific exploration. His astronomical observations, including the 1769 transit of Venus and various eclipse measurements, contributed valuable data to 18th-century astronomy.[^86]

However, Cook's legacy as a pioneering figure of the Enlightenment exists in profound tension with his role as a harbinger of colonialism. His "discoveries"—lands long known to their indigenous inhabitants—laid the groundwork for British imperial expansion across the Pacific.[^87] The consequences for indigenous populations were catastrophic: disease epidemics, land dispossession, cultural disruption, and in many cases, genocide. The British colonization of Australia that Cook's charting enabled resulted in the decimation of Aboriginal populations and cultures, effects that persist today.

In the 21st century, Cook is simultaneously regarded as one of history's greatest explorers and as a symbol of the adverse consequences of European colonialism.[^88][^89] Art historian perspectives emphasize that controversies over Cook memorials and museum displays form part of broader debates about decolonization and restorative justice.[^90] Modern museum exhibitions increasingly aim to present multiple perspectives, allowing Indigenous voices to share their experiences and interpretations alongside traditional European narratives.[^91]

The historiography of Cook reveals how his memory has been "manipulated to suit current social and political concerns" in both European and indigenous contexts.[^92] Earlier biographies, particularly J.C. Beaglehole's influential mid-20th century work, employed what scholars describe as a "hieratic style" that elevated Cook to heroic status while minimizing problematic aspects of his legacy.[^93] Contemporary scholarship increasingly recognizes that there are multiple, often conflicting perspectives on Cook's Pacific presence—European and indigenous viewpoints that are "necessarily distinct and different"—and that meaningful historical understanding requires engaging with this complexity rather than attempting to resolve it into a single narrative.[^94]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Academic and professional assessments of Cook's technical achievements remain overwhelmingly positive. Maritime historians and geographers widely acknowledge that Cook set "new standards of thoroughness in discovery and seamanship, in navigation, cartography, and the care of men at sea, in relations with indigenous peoples both friendly and hostile, and in the application of science at sea."[^95] The Royal Society's recognition of Cook through fellowship and the Copley Medal reflected contemporary appreciation for his contributions to scientific knowledge, particularly in astronomy, geography, and maritime health.[^96]

Cook's cartographic precision is consistently praised by experts. His charts demonstrated unprecedented accuracy achieved through painstaking triangulation, astronomical observations, and systematic surveying techniques. The longevity and reliability of his maps—with some remaining in use for over a century—testifies to the quality of his work.[^97] Navigation experts emphasize that Cook "transformed maritime navigation by precisely charting coastlines with unprecedented accuracy," particularly through his mastery of the marine chronometer, which definitively solved the ancient problem of determining longitude at sea.[^98]

Historians of science emphasize Cook's expeditions' profound impacts on multiple disciplines. The botanical collections from his voyages "greatly enriched global geographic understanding of the vast Pacific region" and established new standards for scientific documentation during exploration.[^99] His systematic approach to observation, record-keeping, and preservation of specimens created models that influenced subsequent scientific expeditions. The precision of Cook's astronomical work, including his transit of Venus observations and eclipse recordings, contributed valuable data that advanced 18th-century astronomy.[^100]

Defenders of Cook's legacy argue that he should be assessed within the context of his era rather than by modern standards. They note that Cook's instructions from the Admiralty explicitly directed him to foster alliances with indigenous peoples and that he developed increasingly sophisticated protocols for peaceful contact after early failures.[^101] Some scholars emphasize that Cook "evolved a policy of race relations aimed at facilitating surveying work and the resupply of his ships, while avoiding friction" with indigenous populations, suggesting he made genuine efforts to minimize violence despite operating within an inherently colonial framework.[^102]

British and Australian institutions continue to commemorate Cook as a foundational figure. The National Maritime Museum in Greenwich houses extensive Cook collections and presents him as a transformational explorer whose voyages "greatly expanded geographical knowledge and paved the way for later British engagement in the Pacific."[^103] Many educational resources present Cook as an exemplar of Enlightenment values—curiosity, empiricism, and scientific rigor—whose achievements advanced human knowledge despite the problematic colonial context in which he operated.[^104]

### Negative Views

Indigenous scholars and activists offer fundamentally different assessments. For many Aboriginal Australians, Māori, Hawaiians, and other Pacific peoples, Cook represents the beginning of catastrophic colonial invasion. As scholars note, "in the 21st century many indigenous people view Cook as a violent invader and a symbol of the adverse consequences of European contact and colonisation."[^105] From this perspective, Cook's navigational achievements are inseparable from their consequences: his "discoveries" enabled colonial conquest, land theft, cultural destruction, and genocide.

Hawaiian scholar Haunani-Kay Trask's characterization of Cook as "a syphilitic, tubercular racist" reflects deep indigenous anger at both Cook's personal actions and the colonial system his explorations enabled.[^106] Critics emphasize that Cook introduced epidemic diseases to previously unexposed populations, with devastating demographic impacts. The venereal diseases, tuberculosis, and other illnesses that spread through Pacific populations following European contact caused massive mortality and suffering.[^107]

Māori perspectives generally condemn Cook as a hostile invader rather than a benevolent explorer. During the 1969 bicentenary of Cook's first voyage, Māori activists demanded official acknowledgment of the Māori people killed by Cook's crew—a demand that highlights how indigenous communities view Cook's expeditions as violent incursions rather than peaceful scientific endeavors.[^108] The British Government's 2019 expression of "regret" for Māori killed after Cook's arrival in New Zealand represents partial official acknowledgment of this perspective, though many indigenous advocates argue that formal apologies and restorative justice measures remain inadequate.[^109]

Recent critical scholarship has documented how Cook's behavior became "increasingly cruel and violent" over the course of his three voyages.[^110] Historians analyzing Cook's journals and crew accounts identify a pattern of escalating punitive violence, particularly during the third voyage. Cook, "frustrated by the refusal of Indigenous people to embrace Western ways," imposed harsh punishments including flogging and property destruction, "embodying the 'savagery' he ostensibly despised."[^111] This analysis challenges earlier hagiographic portrayals and presents a more complex, troubling picture of Cook's character and actions.

Critics also emphasize Cook's role in constructing racist narratives. His published accounts "perpetuated racist stereotypes of Indigenous Peoples," including false accusations of cannibalism and descriptions that portrayed indigenous peoples as "fearsome and uncivilized" to European audiences.[^112] These representations functioned as ideological justification for subsequent colonial interventions and continue to influence stereotypes today.

The decolonization movement in museums and public spaces has prompted fundamental reassessment of how Cook should be commemorated. Art historian Alice Proctor argues that "controversies over public representations of Cook and the display of indigenous artefacts from his voyages are part of a broader debate over resistance to colonialist narratives and the decolonisation of museums and public spaces."[^113] This perspective holds that traditional Cook monuments embody and celebrate colonial conquest, and that maintaining them uncritically perpetuates historical injustices and prevents meaningful reconciliation with indigenous communities.

Contemporary indigenous perspectives emphasize that European "discovery" narratives erase millennia of indigenous presence and knowledge. As indigenous scholars note, lands Cook "discovered" had been home to thriving cultures for thousands of years before his arrival. The very language of "discovery" and "exploration" embeds colonial assumptions that delegitimize indigenous sovereignty and knowledge systems.[^114] From this viewpoint, celebrating Cook's achievements requires ignoring or minimizing the perspectives and experiences of the peoples whose lands he charted and claimed for European empires.
