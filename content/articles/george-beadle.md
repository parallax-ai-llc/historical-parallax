## Summary

George Beadle was an American geneticist who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Edward Tatum for discovering that genes regulate biochemical events within cells. Their 'one gene-one enzyme' hypothesis established the link between genes and proteins. This concept was fundamental to the development of molecular biology and our understanding of gene expression.
