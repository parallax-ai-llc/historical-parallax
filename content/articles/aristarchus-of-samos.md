## Summary

Aristarchus of Samos was an ancient Greek astronomer and mathematician who presented the first known heliocentric model of the solar system, placing the Sun at the center with the Earth revolving around it. His model preceded Copernicus by about 1,800 years. He also attempted to determine the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon using geometric methods, establishing important astronomical measurement techniques.
