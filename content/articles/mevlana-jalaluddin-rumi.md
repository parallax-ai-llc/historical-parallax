## Summary

Jalaluddin Rumi was a 13th-century Persian Sufi mystic and poet whose works are among the most widely read in the world. His six-volume Masnavi is often called 'the Quran in Persian' for its spiritual depth. His transformative encounter with Shams-i-Tabrizi turned him from a conventional scholar into an ecstatic poet. He founded the Mevlevi Order of whirling dervishes. His poetry celebrates divine love, unity, and the journey of the soul to God.
