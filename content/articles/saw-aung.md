## Summary

Saw Aung Hla (1850s–1939) stands as the preeminent intellectual figure among Karen writers in Burma and Thailand, whose historiographical work fundamentally shaped Karen national identity and educational curriculum for over eight decades.[^1] His magnum opus, "A History of the Pgakanyaw" (1939), presented a Christian interpretation of Karen history that chronicled an epic migration narrative beginning from ancient Babylon in 2234 BC, through Yunnan, culminating in arrival at "Kaw-Kawthoolei" (Burma) in 739 BC.[^2] This work, published during the final decade of British colonial rule, became foundational to the Karen Education Department curriculum and continues to be taught in Karen schools across Myanmar, Thailand, and refugee camps, perpetuating a distinctive pan-Karen national consciousness that positions the Karen people as an oppressed yet virtuous nation with ancient roots and prophetic destiny.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Saw Aung Hla was born in the 1850s during a transformative period in Burma's history, when the country was undergoing significant changes under British colonial expansion. While specific details about his birth location, family background, and early childhood remain undocumented in available historical sources, his lifetime coincided with the critical period of British conquest of Burma, which occurred in three stages between 1824 and 1885.[^4]

Saw Aung Hla emerged from the Karen Christian community during an era when American Baptist missionaries, beginning with Adoniram Judson in the 1830s, had achieved remarkable success in converting Karen populations. The Karen people proved exceptionally receptive to Christian missionaries, believing that the arrival of white missionaries with Bibles fulfilled an ancient Karen prophecy about a "lost book" that would be returned by a younger white brother.[^5] This prophecy, which Saw Aung Hla would later incorporate into his historical writings, told of a "Golden Book" given by Y'wa (God) that had been taken away but would one day be restored to the Karen people.[^6]

The educational infrastructure created by Baptist missionaries provided unprecedented literacy opportunities for Karen people. Modern Karen education began in the early 1800s when British and American missionaries introduced formal schooling systems.[^7] Saw Aung Hla likely benefited from this missionary educational network, which would have provided him access to both Western educational methods and Christian theological frameworks that profoundly influenced his later historical scholarship.

As a member of the emerging Karen colonial elite during British rule, Saw Aung Hla belonged to a class of educated Karen bureaucrats who served as intermediaries between British colonial authorities and Karen communities. This position afforded him both the education and social standing necessary to undertake his ambitious historiographical project.[^8] His Christian faith and colonial education shaped his worldview, leading him to synthesize traditional Karen oral histories (tha) with Biblical narratives and colonial historical methodologies.

The precise nature of Saw Aung Hla's formal education remains unclear from available sources, though his sophisticated historical writing demonstrates considerable scholarly training. He spent at least seven years researching and composing his major work, indicating both dedication to historical scholarship and access to resources that enabled sustained intellectual labor.[^9] His position within Karen society and his relationships with both the Karen Christian community and British colonial authorities provided him unique perspectives that would inform his interpretation of Karen history.

## Rise to Prominence

Saw Aung Hla's rise to prominence occurred within the broader context of Karen nationalist awakening during the late British colonial period. Unlike many nationalist movements that emerged in opposition to colonialism, Karen nationalism under British rule took a distinctive form, viewing British colonizers as liberators from Burmese domination rather than as oppressors.[^10]

During the 1920s and 1930s, a remarkable flourishing of Karen historical writing occurred. Three foundational Karen history texts were published during this period: U Pyinnya's "Kayin Chronicle" (1929), U Saw's "Kuyin Great Chronicle" (1931), and Saw Aung Hla's "A History of the Pgakanyaw" (1939).[^11] These three works represented different religious and linguistic perspectives within Karen society—the first two presented Buddhist interpretations using Burmese terminology (Kayin/Kuyin), while Saw Aung Hla's work offered a Christian perspective using the S'gaw Karen term Pgakanyaw.[^12]

Saw Aung Hla distinguished himself among these Karen historians through his systematic approach to chronicling Karen history. He worked collaboratively with another prominent Karen intellectual, T. Thanbyah, and together they became the two most influential British colonial-era Karen authors whose historical texts shaped internal discourses on Karen identity.[^13] The British colonial government effectively endorsed the Karen historical narratives produced by Thanbyah and Aung Hla, officially recognizing the Karen as among the first inhabitants of Burma.[^14]

His work gained particular significance because it addressed the Karen Christian community, which had grown substantially since the 1830s when Baptist missionaries began their successful conversion efforts. By presenting Karen history through a Christian lens while incorporating traditional Karen oral histories, Saw Aung Hla created a synthesis that resonated deeply with Karen Christians who sought to understand their identity within both their indigenous traditions and their adopted faith.[^15]

The publication of "A History of the Pgakanyaw" in 1939 by The Karen Magazine in Bassein marked the culmination of Saw Aung Hla's scholarly efforts and established his reputation as the foremost Karen intellectual.[^16] His timing proved significant—the work appeared virtually at the end of British colonial rule, just before World War II and the Japanese occupation that would dramatically alter Burma's political landscape and intensify Karen-Burman tensions.

## Major Achievements

### Historical Scholarship and Methodology

Saw Aung Hla's greatest achievement lies in his creation of a comprehensive, systematic historical narrative for the Karen people. His work, "A History of the Pgakanyaw," presented an ambitious chronological framework spanning over 2,900 years, beginning with the Karen people's origins in the "Land of Babylon" in 2234 BC, tracing their migration through Yunnan, and documenting their arrival in Burma (which he called "Kaw-Kawthoolei") in 739 BC.[^17] This grand narrative provided the Karen people with a sense of ancient heritage comparable to other great civilizations, positioning them as one of the earliest inhabitants of Burma with a history predating Burman arrival.

His methodology involved collecting and systematizing traditional Karen oral histories known as "tha," which contained teachings passed down through generations about Karen origins, beliefs, and values. Saw Aung Hla synthesized these traditional narratives with Biblical frameworks, creating parallels between Karen traditional beliefs and Judeo-Christian narratives.[^18] This approach validated both Karen indigenous traditions and Christian teachings simultaneously, making his work particularly compelling for Karen Christians seeking to reconcile their ancestral heritage with their adopted faith.

### Synthesis of Karen Tradition and Christian Theology

One of Saw Aung Hla's most significant intellectual achievements was his articulation of connections between traditional Karen beliefs about Y'wa (God) and Christian theology. He documented Karen creation stories that remarkably paralleled Biblical Genesis accounts, including the creation of woman from man's rib and narratives of human disobedience leading to separation from the divine.[^19] While critics have noted these accounts have "a suspiciously Christian ring," suggesting missionary influence on traditional narratives, Saw Aung Hla presented them as authentic Karen traditions that demonstrated the Karen people's connection to Biblical history.[^20]

He advanced the theory that the Karen people were a lost tribe of Israel, positioning them within Biblical prophetic history.[^21] This claim, combined with the traditional Karen prophecy about the "Golden Book" that would be returned by a white brother, provided a powerful theological framework that explained and justified Karen receptiveness to Christian missionaries and distinguished Karen identity from Buddhist Burman identity.[^22]

### Educational Legacy and Curriculum Development

Perhaps Saw Aung Hla's most enduring achievement is the incorporation of his historical work into the Karen Education Department curriculum, where it has remained for over 60-70 years.[^23] His book "The Karen History" became required reading in Karen schools throughout "Kawthoolei" (Karen-controlled areas), ensuring that generations of Karen students learned history from his perspective.[^24] This institutional adoption meant that his historical narrative became the foundational text through which Karen children came to understand their identity as a people with ancient origins, a distinctive culture, and a national destiny.[^25]

The Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD), established by the Karen National Union in 1947, developed a curriculum significantly different from the Burmese government curriculum, focusing on Karen language, history, and culture based substantially on Saw Aung Hla's historical framework.[^26] After 1984, when Karen schooling moved into refugee camps in Thailand with support from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and international NGOs, Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative continued to be taught, spreading his influence across international borders.[^27]

### Construction of Karen National Identity

Saw Aung Hla's work played a crucial role in constructing what Benedict Anderson called an "imagined community"—a pan-Karen national consciousness that transcended local, linguistic, and religious differences among diverse groups classified as "Karen."[^28] His historical narrative helped create mass Karen literacy and national consciousness, particularly in areas where schools sustained his educational framework.[^29]

His academic work helped Karen generations "come to know of themselves as Karen who exist as a nation in the past, present, and future."[^30] This was no small achievement given that Karen identity is inherently complex, as peoples known as "Karen" do not share a common language, culture, religion, or material characteristics, and the dominant pan-Karen identity is largely a product of social and historical forces mediated by British colonial policies and practices.[^31]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Historical Accuracy and Mythological Construction

Saw Aung Hla's historical work has faced significant scholarly criticism regarding its historical accuracy and methodological rigor. His central narrative—that the Karen people migrated from Babylon in 2234 BC through Yunnan to arrive in Burma in 739 BC—lacks archaeological or documentary evidence from sources outside Karen oral traditions.[^32] Critics argue that his chronology and migration narrative reflect mythological construction rather than empirically verifiable history.

The striking parallels between Saw Aung Hla's accounts of Karen creation stories and Biblical Genesis narratives have led scholars to question whether these represent authentic pre-Christian Karen traditions or post-conversion syncretism influenced by missionary teaching.[^33] His account of Y'wa creating woman from man's rib, for instance, corresponds so closely to Genesis that scholars have noted it has "a suspiciously Christian ring to it."[^34] This raises questions about whether Saw Aung Hla documented genuine Karen traditions or inadvertently (or deliberately) retrofitted Karen oral histories with Christian theological frameworks.

### Lost Tribe of Israel Claim

Saw Aung Hla's assertion that the Karen people constitute a lost tribe of Israel has been particularly controversial.[^35] While this claim provided powerful theological justification for Karen Christian identity and distinguished Karen people from Buddhist Burmans, it lacks genetic, linguistic, or archaeological support. Similar "lost tribe" claims have been made by numerous groups worldwide, and most have been dismissed by mainstream scholarship as reflecting religious aspiration rather than historical fact.[^36]

The "Golden Book" prophecy that Saw Aung Hla incorporated into his historical narrative—which supposedly foretold that a white brother would return with a lost book—appears suspiciously convenient in retrospectively justifying Karen receptiveness to Western missionaries.[^37] Skeptics suggest this prophecy may have been elaborated or even created after missionary contact rather than representing an authentic ancient tradition.

### Pro-Colonial Perspective and Bias

One of the most significant criticisms of Saw Aung Hla's work concerns his strongly pro-British colonial perspective. He concluded "The Karen History" with descriptions of how the Karen appreciated British colonizers who "freed the Karen from Burmese oppression" and how Karen people "finally restored the glory of their people during the British colonial period."[^38] This interpretation stands in stark contrast to most anticolonial nationalist narratives that emerged across Asia during the same period.

Critics argue that Saw Aung Hla's colonial elite status influenced his historical interpretation, leading him to valorize British colonialism rather than critique it.[^39] His narrative positioned the British arrival in the nineteenth century as "a liberation from Burmese domination, which permitted the re-emergence of indigenous Karen culture."[^40] This pro-colonial stance has been criticized as reflecting the interests of Karen colonial bureaucrats who benefited from British rule rather than representing the experiences of ordinary Karen people who faced exploitation under colonialism.

### Construction of Karen Victimhood and Division

Scholar Nick Cheesman examined Saw Aung Hla's work alongside T. Thanbyah's writings and identified problematic themes in their construction of Karen identity, particularly the portrayal of "Karen as oppressed" and "Karen as virtuous."[^41] These themes, while mobilizing Karen nationalism, also perpetuated narratives of victimhood and reinforced Karen-Burman antagonism that contributed to decades of armed conflict following Burmese independence.

Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative emphasized Karen suffering under Burmese domination, positioning Burmans as oppressors and Karen as perpetual victims requiring external protection.[^42] Critics argue this framework, while politically useful for mobilizing Karen nationalism, oversimplified complex historical relationships and contributed to ethnic polarization that made post-independence reconciliation more difficult.

### Homogenization of Diverse Karen Populations

The construction of a unified "Karen" identity through Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative has been criticized for homogenizing extremely diverse populations. The term "Karen" encompasses numerous ethnic groups with different languages, cultures, religions, and historical experiences.[^43] By creating a single historical narrative applicable to all "Karen" people, Saw Aung Hla's work arguably obscured important differences and imposed a Christian, S'gaw Karen perspective on Buddhist Karen and other Karen subgroups who had different historical traditions.

### Perpetuation of Nationalist Mythology in Education

The continued use of Saw Aung Hla's work in Karen Education Department curriculum has been criticized for perpetuating nationalist mythology rather than critical historical thinking.[^44] For over 60-70 years, Karen students in Kawthoolei schools and refugee camps have learned Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative as fact, potentially limiting their exposure to alternative interpretations and critical historical methodologies.[^45]

Photocopied and typed reproductions of Saw Aung Hla's work circulated without legal authorization from the Burmese government both inside and outside Burma, especially in the Burma-Thai border area, demonstrating both the work's influence and its contested status vis-à-vis official Burmese historiography.[^46]

---

## Personal Life

Detailed information about Saw Aung Hla's personal life, family relationships, and personality remains remarkably scarce in available historical sources. This absence of personal biographical detail is not uncommon for intellectuals from this period in Burma, particularly those from ethnic minority communities whose lives were not extensively documented by colonial administrators or contemporary chroniclers.[^47]

What can be inferred about Saw Aung Hla's personal life comes primarily from understanding his social position and the context in which he lived. As a member of the Karen Christian community and colonial elite during British rule, he likely enjoyed relative social privilege compared to many Karen people.[^48] His ability to dedicate at least seven years to researching and writing his major historical work suggests he had financial security and social support enabling sustained intellectual labor rather than requiring him to focus exclusively on subsistence.[^49]

Saw Aung Hla's Christian faith appears to have been central to his identity and worldview. His historical work reflects deep engagement with Christian theology and Biblical narratives, suggesting that religious conviction was not merely a social identity but a fundamental aspect of how he understood Karen history and identity.[^50] His synthesis of traditional Karen beliefs about Y'wa with Christian theology indicates someone who took both his ancestral traditions and adopted faith seriously, seeking to demonstrate their compatibility rather than viewing them as contradictory.

His collaborative relationship with T. Thanbyah and other Karen intellectuals of the period suggests he participated in networks of Karen educated elites who engaged in collective projects of identity formation and nationalist awakening.[^51] These intellectual circles likely provided both the social support and intellectual stimulation that enabled his historical scholarship.

The fact that Saw Aung Hla chose to write in S'gaw Karen language rather than Burmese or English reveals important aspects of his priorities and intended audience. This choice indicates commitment to Karen linguistic preservation and accessibility to Karen-speaking communities rather than seeking maximum reach among colonial administrators or Burman elites.[^52]

His decision to publish through The Karen Magazine in Bassein (now Pathein) in 1939 suggests connections to Karen publishing networks and institutions that supported Karen-language intellectual production.[^53] The publication in Bassein, a significant center of Karen Christian activity, further reinforces his embeddedness in Karen Christian communities.

Saw Aung Hla's personality, as it can be glimpsed through his scholarly work, appears to have combined intellectual ambition with cultural preservation commitment. The scope of his historical project—spanning nearly 3,000 years of purported Karen history—demonstrates intellectual audacity and nationalist conviction. His meticulous approach to collecting and systematizing traditional oral histories suggests someone who valued both innovation and tradition, seeking to preserve Karen heritage while presenting it in modern historical form.

## Legacy

### Enduring Educational Influence

Saw Aung Hla's most profound and enduring legacy lies in his shaping of Karen education and historical consciousness across multiple generations. His book "The Karen History" has remained a foundational text in the Karen Education Department curriculum for over 60-70 years, making it one of the longest-continuously-used historical texts in Southeast Asian ethnic education.[^54] This extraordinary longevity means that multiple generations of Karen people have formed their understanding of Karen identity, origins, and historical destiny primarily through Saw Aung Hla's interpretive framework.

The Karen Education and Culture Department (KECD), established in 1947 by the Karen National Union, adopted Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative as central to its curriculum, which differs significantly from the Burmese government curriculum.[^55] Karen history is taught using the Karen curriculum whether in refugee camps, in Karen-run migrant schools, or in KNU-operated school systems inside liberated areas of Karen State in Burma, demonstrating the geographic reach and institutional staying power of his educational legacy.[^56]

Beginning in the 1980s and expanding after 1984, Karen-medium language education spread into Thai refugee camps where Karen had been living for nearly four decades, supported by UNHCR and international NGOs.[^57] In these displaced contexts, Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative took on additional significance, providing Karen refugees with a sense of historical continuity and national identity despite physical displacement and political dispossession.

### Foundation of Karen National Consciousness

Saw Aung Hla's historical work helped create what Benedict Anderson termed an "imagined community"—enabling Karen people from diverse linguistic, religious, and regional backgrounds to conceive of themselves as members of a single nation with shared origins and collective destiny.[^58] His academic work helped "Karen generations come to know of themselves as Karen who exist as a nation in the past, present, and future."[^59]

This construction of pan-Karen national consciousness had profound political implications. The Karen National Union, founded in 1947, pursued the goal of establishing "Kawthoolei country," a sovereign Karen state, drawing on historical narratives like those Saw Aung Hla provided to justify Karen claims to distinct nationhood and territorial sovereignty.[^60] The name "Kawthoolei" itself—which Saw Aung Hla used to describe the land where Karen people arrived in 739 BC—became central to Karen nationalist aspirations, "resonating deeply as a dreamland of the Karen struggle."[^61]

### Scholarly Impact and Academic Engagement

Saw Aung Hla's work continues to be a subject of academic study and scholarly debate. The 2021 article "The Historiography of Saw Aung Hla and Its Influence on the Modern Karen History Curriculum" by Saw Alwyn, published in the Journal of Burma Studies, represents contemporary scholarly engagement with his legacy.[^62] His historical texts, alongside those of T. Thanbyah, serve as primary source material for understanding pan-Karen identity construction and the role of colonial-era intellectuals in ethnic nationalist movements.[^63]

Contemporary research examines how Saw Aung Hla's work reflects broader patterns of nationalist historiography, colonial influence on indigenous historical consciousness, and the relationship between religious conversion and ethnic identity formation. His synthesis of traditional oral histories with Christian theology and Western historical methodologies provides scholars with a case study in cultural hybridity and colonial modernity.[^64]

### Influence on Karen Ethno-Nationalism

The themes Saw Aung Hla emphasized in his historical narrative—Karen as oppressed, Karen as virtuous, Karen as ancient inhabitants of Burma, and British colonialism as liberation from Burmese domination—have had lasting influence on Karen political discourse and ethno-nationalist ideology.[^65] These frameworks shaped how Karen nationalists understood their relationship with the Burmese state following independence in 1948 and contributed to the decision to pursue armed resistance rather than integration into the Burmese nation-state.

The Karen conflict, which began in 1949 and became one of the world's longest-running civil conflicts, was ideologically sustained in part by historical narratives like those Saw Aung Hla provided.[^66] His portrayal of Karen as a distinct nation with ancient roots and legitimate territorial claims provided historical justification for Karen separatist aspirations.

### Contested Memory and Continuing Relevance

Saw Aung Hla's legacy remains contested. Within Karen nationalist circles, he is revered as the foremost Karen intellectual who preserved Karen history and strengthened Karen national consciousness.[^67] In these contexts, his work is treated with reverence, and questioning its historical accuracy can be viewed as betraying Karen national interests.

However, critical scholars and those advocating for Karen-Burman reconciliation view his legacy more ambivalently, recognizing his historical importance while questioning whether his pro-British, anti-Burman narrative perpetuates divisions that hinder peace and national integration.[^68] The continued teaching of his historical framework in Karen schools raises questions about whether it prepares young Karen people for critical engagement with complex historical realities or reinforces nationalist mythologies that may impede conflict resolution.

As recently as 2026, debates about Karen sovereignty and the dream of Kawthoolei continue, with some groups declaring independence while the Karen National Union dismisses such declarations, revealing ongoing disagreements about Karen political aspirations that trace back to historical narratives Saw Aung Hla helped establish.[^69]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

#### Pioneer of Karen Historiography

Supporters and scholars recognize Saw Aung Hla as the pioneering figure in systematic Karen historiography who transformed fragmentary oral traditions into a comprehensive written historical narrative. Saw Alwyn, writing in the Journal of Burma Studies, acknowledges that Saw Aung Hla's academic work "helps Karen generations come to know of themselves as Karen who exist as a nation in the past, present, and future."[^70] This achievement is particularly significant given that many ethnic minority groups in Burma lacked written historical traditions that could compete with Burman historical narratives in colonial and post-colonial contexts.

Defenders of his legacy argue that Saw Aung Hla performed the invaluable service of preserving traditional Karen oral histories (tha) that might otherwise have been lost to modernization and cultural change.[^71] By systematically collecting and documenting these traditional teachings, he created a permanent record of Karen cultural heritage that subsequent generations could access and study.

#### Enabler of Karen National Awakening

From the perspective of Karen nationalism, Saw Aung Hla's contribution to Karen national consciousness cannot be overstated. His historical narrative provided Karen people with a sense of ancient heritage, distinctive identity, and legitimate claims to self-determination that justified their political aspirations.[^72] The British colonial government's endorsement of his historical framework, officially recognizing the Karen as among the first inhabitants of Burma, provided international legitimacy to Karen historical claims.[^73]

His work appeared at a critical historical juncture—the final decade of British colonial rule—when questions about Burma's post-independence political structure were being debated. By providing a comprehensive historical foundation for Karen distinctiveness, Saw Aung Hla equipped Karen leaders with intellectual ammunition for negotiations about political autonomy and territorial rights.[^74]

#### Creator of Educational Infrastructure

The enduring use of Saw Aung Hla's work in Karen Education Department curriculum for over six decades represents remarkable educational continuity and demonstrates the practical utility of his historical framework for Karen educational institutions.[^75] In contexts of displacement—refugee camps, migrant schools, and resistance-controlled territories—his historical narrative has provided educational continuity and cultural preservation when other aspects of Karen life faced disruption.[^76]

Supporters argue that his synthesis of Christian theology with Karen traditions created a culturally coherent framework that enabled Karen Christians to maintain connection with their indigenous heritage while embracing their adopted faith, resolving potential tensions between tradition and modernity.[^77]

#### Model of Indigenous Intellectual Production

Saw Aung Hla's example of sustained intellectual labor—spending at least seven years on his historical research—demonstrates the capacity of indigenous intellectuals to produce sophisticated historical scholarship during the colonial period.[^78] His choice to write in S'gaw Karen rather than English or Burmese represented a commitment to accessibility for Karen-speaking communities and resistance to complete cultural assimilation.[^79]

### Negative Views

#### Propagator of Unverifiable Mythology

Critics argue that Saw Aung Hla's historical narrative, particularly claims about Karen migration from Babylon in 2234 BC and arrival in Burma in 739 BC, constitutes mythology rather than history, lacking archaeological, linguistic, or documentary evidence outside Karen oral traditions.[^80] Scholarly skepticism particularly focuses on the "lost tribe of Israel" claim, which appears to reflect Christian theological influence rather than verifiable historical fact.[^81]

The striking parallels between his accounts of Karen creation stories and Biblical Genesis narratives suggest that his work may represent post-Christian syncretism influenced by missionary teaching rather than authentic preservation of pre-Christian Karen traditions.[^82] His account of Y'wa creating woman from man's rib has been characterized as having "a suspiciously Christian ring to it," raising questions about the historical integrity of his source materials.[^83]

#### Enabler of Ethnic Conflict

From the perspective of those advocating Burmese national unity and Karen-Burman reconciliation, Saw Aung Hla's historical framework has had pernicious effects by perpetuating narratives of Karen victimhood and Burman oppression that contributed to ethnic polarization and armed conflict.[^84] Scholar Nick Cheesman's analysis identified how Saw Aung Hla's work promoted concepts of "Karen as oppressed" and "Karen as virtuous" that became central to internal Karen identity discourse.[^85]

Critics argue that his pro-British, anti-Burman historical framework made post-independence reconciliation more difficult by portraying Karen-Burman relations exclusively through a lens of oppression rather than acknowledging periods of coexistence and mutual influence.[^86] His conclusion celebrating British colonizers as liberators has been criticized for valorizing colonial exploitation and reflecting colonial elite interests rather than those of ordinary Karen people.[^87]

#### Impediment to Critical Historical Thinking

The continued use of Saw Aung Hla's work as the foundational text in Karen education has been criticized for perpetuating nationalist mythology rather than fostering critical historical thinking.[^88] For over six decades, Karen students have learned his narrative as established fact rather than as one interpretation among many, potentially limiting their exposure to alternative perspectives and critical methodologies.[^89]

His work's dominance in Karen education may hinder the development of more nuanced, evidence-based Karen historiography that could acknowledge the constructed nature of ethnic identities and the complex, multifaceted nature of Karen-Burman historical relations.[^90]

#### Homogenizer of Karen Diversity

Critics point out that Saw Aung Hla's creation of a unified "Karen" historical narrative imposed Christian, S'gaw Karen perspectives on extremely diverse populations with different languages, cultures, religions, and historical experiences.[^91] By presenting a single narrative applicable to all "Karen" people, his work arguably obscured important differences among Karen subgroups and marginalized alternative Karen historical traditions, particularly Buddhist Karen narratives that did not align with his Christian framework.[^92]

The fact that two Buddhist Karen historians—U Pyinnya and U Saw—published alternative Karen histories during the same period that emphasized Karen existence within Buddhist civilization rather than separate from it demonstrates that Saw Aung Hla's Christian narrative represented only one possible Karen historical interpretation, not an objective account.[^93]
