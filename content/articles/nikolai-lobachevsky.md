## Summary

Nikolai Lobachevsky was a Russian mathematician who independently developed non-Euclidean geometry, also called Lobachevskian or hyperbolic geometry. He was one of the first to conceive of a consistent geometry in which Euclid's parallel postulate does not hold. His revolutionary work challenged 2,000 years of mathematical tradition and later proved essential for Einstein's general theory of relativity.
