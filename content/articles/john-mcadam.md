## Summary

John Loudon McAdam revolutionized road construction with his macadam road surface technique, using layers of small broken stones bound by gravel. His method of road building was cheaper and more durable than previous methods and was widely adopted worldwide. The word 'tarmac' derives from his name combined with tar.
