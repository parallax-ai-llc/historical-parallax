## Summary

James Marion Sims is often called the father of modern gynecology for developing surgical techniques for vesicovaginal fistula repair. He invented the Sims speculum and the Sims position used in gynecological examinations. His legacy is deeply controversial because he developed his techniques by performing experimental surgeries on enslaved Black women without anesthesia.
