## Summary

Jeffrey Edward Epstein (1953-2019) was an American financier and convicted sex offender whose life and death exposed a vast network of wealth, power, and exploitation. Rising from obscurity to manage billions for elite clients through mysterious means, Epstein operated an extensive sex trafficking operation that victimized dozens (possibly hundreds) of underage girls. His connections to presidents, princes, scientists, and celebrities shielded him from consequences for years. A 2008 plea deal—criticized as sweetheart deal—resulted in minimal punishment. When finally arrested on federal charges in 2019, Epstein died in his cell under circumstances that spawned conspiracy theories. His case became a symbol of how the wealthy and powerful evade justice.
