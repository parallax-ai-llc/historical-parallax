## Summary

Nilakantha Somayaji was a key member of the Kerala school of mathematics who developed a partially heliocentric model of the solar system in which all planets except Earth orbit the Sun, anticipating Tycho Brahe's model. His work Tantrasamgraha (1501) refined infinite series for pi and trigonometric functions developed by Madhava.
