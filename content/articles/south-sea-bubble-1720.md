## Overview

The South Sea Bubble of 1720 was one of the first and most extravagant financial collapses in history. The South Sea Company was formed to trade with Spanish America (slave trade, mostly), but its real business was restructuring British government debt. Through bribery, insider trading, and pure hype, the company's stock skyrocketed from £100 to £1,000 in a single year, dragging the entire British economy into a frenzy. When the bubble burst, it bankrupt the aristocracy and the poor alike. Even Sir Isaac Newton lost £20,000 (millions today), famously saying: *"I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."*

## The Hype Machine

The company promised immense riches from trade in the South Seas (South America).
**Reality:**
Spain controlled South America and barely allowed British ships to dock. The trade did not exist.
**The Pump:**
Directors bribed MPs with free stock to pass laws favoring the company.
New "Bubble Companies" sprang up to ride the wave, with ludicrous prospectuses:
- "A company for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is."
- "For importing walnut trees from Virginia."
- "For extracting sunlight from cucumbers" (satirized by Swift).

## The Crash (September 1720)

The price hit £1,000 in August.
Directors began quietly selling.
By September, panic set in. The price plummeted to £150.
**Suicides and Ruin:** The Postmaster General took poison. Lords and ladies pawned their jewels.

## Aftermath

**The Bubble Act 1720:**
Parliament banned joint-stock companies without a royal charter, stifling the British corporate economy for a century.
**Robert Walpole:**
The crisis brought Walpole to power as the first *de facto* Prime Minister, tasked with cleaning up the mess and restoring credit.
