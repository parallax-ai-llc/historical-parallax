## Summary

Wally Funk was one of the Mercury 13 — women who passed the same physical tests as the Mercury astronauts in 1961 but were barred from the program due to their gender. She finally reached space in 2021 at age 82, flying on Blue Origin's New Shepard, becoming the oldest person to fly in space at that time.
