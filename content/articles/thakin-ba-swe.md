## Summary

Thakin Ba Swe (1915-1987) was a prominent Burmese nationalist, socialist leader, and the second Prime Minister of Burma, serving from June 1956 to February 1957. Known by his nickname "Big Tiger" (Kyah gyi Ba Swe) earned during his days as a student activist at Rangoon University in the 1930s, Ba Swe played a crucial role in Burma's independence movement as a member of the Dobama Asiayone and co-founder of the Burma Socialist Party.[^1] His political career was marked by his pioneering efforts to synthesize Buddhist philosophy with Marxist ideology, his leadership in the anti-colonial struggle, and his involvement in the political crisis that split the ruling Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) in 1958.[^2]

## Early Life and Background

Ba Swe was born on October 17, 1915, into Burma during the British colonial period, a time when nationalist sentiment was beginning to crystallize among educated Burmese youth.[^3] While specific details about his early childhood and family background remain scarce in historical records, what is well-documented is his emergence as a student leader during his time at Rangoon University in the 1930s, an institution that became the crucible of Burmese nationalism during this era.[^4]

By the 1930s, Rangoon University had become the hotbed of Burmese nationalism, producing a remarkable generation of future leaders including General Aung San, U Nu, Ba Maw, Kyaw Nyein, U Thant, and Thein Pe Myint.[^5] Ba Swe distinguished himself among this cohort, earning the moniker "Big Tiger" for his fierce advocacy and leadership qualities.[^6] In 1935, he joined Aung San, U Nu, Thein Pe Myint, and Kyaw Nyein to lead the Rangoon University Students' Union (RUSU), where they organized the second university students' strike against British colonial rule.[^7]

His name became closely associated with another prominent student leader, Ba Hein, and the pair were often mentioned together as "Ba Hein and Ba Swe."[^8] Both were members of the nationalist Dobama Asiayone (We Burmans Association), an organization whose members famously called each other "thakin" (master), reclaiming a term of respect that Burmese subjects had been conditioned to reserve exclusively for their British colonizers.[^9] This deliberate linguistic assertion was intended to cultivate what the Dobama founders called a "master mentality" to replace the "slave mentality" they believed colonial rule had imposed.[^10]

After Ko Nu, Ko Aung San, and Ko Kyaw Nyein graduated and engaged in full-time politics, Ba Hein and Ba Swe succeeded them in the RUSU leadership and continued anti-colonial agitation from their university platform.[^11] Their activism culminated in their arrest by British authorities during the nationwide protests, demonstrations, and strikes of 1938, known as the "1300 Revolution" (named after the year in the Burmese calendar).[^12] This mass movement, which began with oilfield worker strikes and evolved into a general strike organized by the Dobama Asiayone, united thousands of Burmese people in solidarity against colonial rule and is regarded as one of the seminal steps toward Myanmar's eventual independence.[^13]

In 1942, during the tumultuous period of Japanese occupation, Ba Swe married Nu Nu Swe, daughter of U Hlaing Phyu, a wealthy landowner and mine owner in Palaw Township, Mergui District.[^14] The couple would have ten children together, establishing a large family even as Ba Swe's political activities intensified.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Ba Swe's transformation from student activist to national political leader occurred during the critical years of World War II and Burma's struggle for independence. In 1939, Ba Hein became a founder member of the Communist Party of Burma (CPB), and shortly afterward, Ba Swe and Ba Hein, among others, founded the People's Revolutionary Party (PRP), which would be renamed the Burma Socialist Party after the war.[^16] In early 1940, the PRP brought together both Communists and non-Communist radicals, including Thakin Aung San, Thakin Mya, Thakin Ba Hein, Thakin Hla Pe (Bo Let Ya), Thakin Chit, Thakin Nu (U Nu), Thakin Kyaw Nyein, Ba Swe, and others.[^17] The PRP served as a parallel organization to the CPB and was actually more important at this stage, with Thakin Ba Hein acting as liaison officer between the two parties.[^18]

The Japanese occupation of Burma (1942-1945) created complex political dynamics for nationalist leaders. While Ba Maw (a different political leader) collaborated with the Japanese as head of the puppet state, Ba Swe and other socialists worked underground to organize resistance.[^19] In August 1944, Ba Swe was one of three socialists from the People's Revolutionary Party, along with Kyaw Nyein and Thakin Chit, who founded the Anti-Fascist Organisation (AFO).[^20] This clandestine resistance movement brought together the Communist Party of Burma led by Thakin Soe, the Burma National Army led by Aung San, and socialists from the PRP to fight against Japanese occupation.[^21]

At a historic meeting held from March 1-3, 1945, the AFO was renamed the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL), with the name change signaling that the aim was both to liberate Burma from the Japanese and to achieve independence from colonial rule.[^22] The AFPFL would become the central organization in Burma's independence movement, with an AFPFL delegation led by Aung San negotiating independence terms in London in January 1947.[^23] Burma achieved independence in January 1948, and the AFPFL became the ruling party.[^24]

Recognizing the need to counter communist influence within the AFPFL, Ba Swe, Kyaw Nyein, and five others formally established the Burma Socialist Party in 1945 to prevent a communist takeover of the umbrella organization.[^25] Ba Swe served as general secretary while Kyaw Nyein became joint secretary.[^26] After Ko Ko Gyi resigned in 1948, the party was led jointly by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein.[^27] The Burma Socialist Party would shape domestic and foreign policies during the crucial period of 1948-1958, providing ideological direction even during times of internal division within the AFPFL.[^28]

Ba Swe's stature within the independence movement and the AFPFL steadily grew throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s. As both a deputy to U Nu in the AFPFL and leader of the Socialist Party, he emerged as one of the most influential figures in post-independence Burmese politics.[^29] When U Nu voluntarily relinquished the Prime Ministerial position after the 1956 parliamentary elections to devote full-time to reorganizing and strengthening the AFPFL, Ba Swe was the natural choice to assume the premiership.[^30]

## Major Achievements

Ba Swe's term as the second Prime Minister of Burma, from June 12, 1956, to February 28, 1957, represented the pinnacle of his political career.[^31] Time magazine marked his assumption of the premiership with an article titled "The Day of the Tiger," a reference to his university-era nickname.[^32] Though his tenure lasted less than nine months, it came during a critical period when Burma was working to consolidate its democratic institutions and economic recovery after years of insurgency and political instability.[^33]

As Prime Minister, Ba Swe continued the AFPFL's policies of democratic socialism and neutralism in foreign affairs.[^34] His government maintained Burma's position of non-alignment during the Cold War, though Ba Swe himself was known to be sympathetic to Maoist China. As Secretary-General of the Burma Socialist Party, he had publicly expressed his gratification over Mao Tse-tung's victories in China and the conclusion of the Communist Sino-Russian Treaty.[^35] This pro-Mao stance reflected his ideological commitment to socialist internationalism while still maintaining Burma's official neutral position in global affairs.[^36]

U Nu resumed office as Prime Minister on February 28, 1957, after completing his work reorganizing the AFPFL, and Ba Swe returned to his role as a senior leader within both the party and the Socialist Party.[^37] However, Ba Swe's most significant intellectual achievement lay not in his brief stint as Prime Minister but in his pioneering theoretical work synthesizing Buddhist philosophy with Marxist ideology—a project that would profoundly influence Burmese political thought.[^38]

In December 1946, at the first congress of the Socialist Party of Burma, Ba Swe delivered a landmark speech entitled "Guide for the Socialist Party of Burma," which systematically introduced basic concepts of socialism and stated that the political theory of the party was "socialism based on Marxism."[^39] Ba Swe used the Buddhist concept of "happening" to describe the beginning of social revolution and equated "heaven on earth" in Buddhism with the ideal society described in Marx's theory of scientific socialism.[^40] He introduced the dialectical materialistic concept that matter is in constant motion alongside the Buddhist concept of metempsychosis (rebirth), and used Buddhism's theory of cause and effect to interpret that all matters are temporary.[^41]

This ideological synthesis represented a distinctly Burmese contribution to socialist theory. Unlike crude attempts to impose European Marxism on Asian societies, Ba Swe's Buddhist-Marxist syncretism attempted to root socialist ideas in Burma's indigenous philosophical traditions.[^42] His 1957 book "The Burmese Revolution" articulated this vision in detail, described as "an important statement on Marxism and Buddhism by the Secretary-General of the Burma Socialist Party and President of the Trades Union Congress (Burma)."[^43] The approximately 45-page work represented his effort to create a socialism that would resonate with Burma's Buddhist majority while maintaining fidelity to Marxist principles.[^44]

Beyond his intellectual contributions, Ba Swe was instrumental in building the institutional foundations of the Burma Socialist Party, which became one of the AFPFL's most important constituent organizations.[^45] The party provided crucial organizational strength and ideological coherence to the independence movement and early post-colonial government.[^46] Ba Swe's leadership, alongside Kyaw Nyein, established the Socialist Party as a counterweight to the Communist Party of Burma, ensuring that Burma's path to socialism would be democratic rather than totalitarian.[^47]

His long partnership with Kyaw Nyein was particularly significant. Together, they led what became known as the "Third Camp" in Burmese politics—democratic socialists who rejected both Western capitalism and Soviet-style communism in favor of a distinctly Burmese socialist path.[^48] This ideological position allowed Burma to maintain its independence and non-aligned status during the Cold War's most intense period.[^49]

## Controversies and Criticisms

The most significant controversy of Ba Swe's political career was the catastrophic split of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League in 1958, which fundamentally altered Burma's political trajectory and ultimately contributed to the conditions that enabled military rule.[^50] By mid-1958, Ba Swe had fallen out with his senior colleague U Nu, and their personal and political rivalry tore apart the coalition that had governed Burma since independence.[^51]

The AFPFL fractured into two hostile factions: the "Clean AFPFL" led by U Nu and Thakin Tin, and the "Stable AFPFL" led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein.[^52] On June 4, 1958, Ba Swe, together with Kyaw Nyein and thirteen other ministers, resigned from the government and tabled a motion of no-confidence against U Nu in Parliament.[^53] This dramatic move plunged Burma into political crisis. On June 8, 1958, the no-confidence motion was put to a vote, but U Nu's government survived by a mere eight votes because the leftist National United Front (NUF) voted with the government.[^54]

The split was not merely a personality conflict but reflected deeper disagreements about policy and patronage. Critics of Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein argued that their "Stable AFPFL" was more concerned with maintaining bureaucratic control and economic privileges than with genuine socialist transformation.[^55] The faction's name itself—"Stable"—suggested a focus on order and continuity rather than reform, contrasting with U Nu's "Clean" faction, which promised to purge corruption and renew the AFPFL's revolutionary spirit.[^56]

Allegedly due to the instability arising from the AFPFL split and escalating insurgent problems, U Nu on September 26, 1958, "voluntarily" invited Army Chief of Staff General Ne Win to take over as Prime Minister in a "caretaker" capacity.[^57] However, U Nu later claimed in his memoirs that his handover of power was not voluntary but that a group of Army officers threatened him with a "straight military coup" should he refuse.[^58] The parliamentary session on September 28 and subsequent vote on October 28, 1958, formally appointed Ne Win as Prime Minister of a caretaker government.[^59]

Ba Swe's role in creating the conditions for this military intervention has been a subject of historical debate. Some scholars argue that by splitting the AFPFL and creating political gridlock, Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein inadvertently opened the door for military involvement in politics—a development that would prove disastrous for Burmese democracy.[^60] The caretaker government, ostensibly temporary, established a precedent for military rule and gave the Tatmadaw (armed forces) a taste for political power.[^61]

The February 1960 general election delivered a devastating verdict on Ba Swe's political judgment. U Nu's Clean faction of the AFPFL won in a landslide victory, securing 157 or 158 seats (sources vary slightly) in the Chamber of Deputies, while the Stable faction led by Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein won only 41 seats.[^62] Kyaw Nyein even lost his own parliamentary seat.[^63] The election was widely interpreted not so much as a contest between the two AFPFL factions but as a referendum on General Ne Win's caretaker government policies between 1958 and 1960—and the electorate's resounding rejection of military rule.[^64]

By the time of General Ne Win's coup d'état on March 2, 1962, Ba Swe was out of power and regarded as a "dead tiger" politically—a bitter irony given his youthful nickname "Big Tiger."[^65] Because he posed no threat, he was not among those initially detained by Ne Win's Revolutionary Council.[^66] However, in 1963, during peace talks between the Revolutionary Council and various armed insurgent groups, Ba Swe was detained along with U Nu.[^67] They were released on October 27, 1966, though their political careers were effectively over.[^68]

Critics have also questioned Ba Swe's pro-Mao sympathies, arguing that his ideological attraction to Chinese communism was naive and potentially dangerous for Burma's independence.[^69] While he advocated neutralism officially, his public expressions of support for Mao's victories suggested a tilt toward Beijing that some viewed as incompatible with genuine non-alignment.[^70] Additionally, his attempts to synthesize Buddhism and Marxism, while intellectually ambitious, have been criticized by both traditionalist Buddhists who saw it as diluting the Dhamma and by orthodox Marxists who viewed it as an unprincipled compromise with religion.[^71]

## Personal Life

Ba Swe married Nu Nu Swe in 1942, daughter of U Hlaing Phyu, the owner of mining properties and lands in Palaw Township, Mergui District.[^72] The marriage connected Ba Swe to a wealthy landowning family, which provided financial security even as he pursued his political career.[^73] Together, Ba Swe and Nu Nu Swe had ten children, establishing a large family that was common among Burmese families of their generation and social standing.[^74]

Despite his family's wealth through his wife's inheritance, Ba Swe maintained his socialist credentials and lived relatively modestly by the standards of political leaders.[^75] His commitment to socialist principles appeared genuine rather than merely rhetorical, and he was known for his serious, intellectually rigorous approach to political ideology.[^76]

Ba Swe was also known for his distinctive personal style, particularly his penchant for wearing dark glasses, which became something of a trademark.[^77] This sartorial choice added to his image as a tough, uncompromising political figure—reinforcing the "Big Tiger" persona he had cultivated since his university days.[^78]

Little is recorded about his life during the long years of house arrest and political marginalization under Ne Win's military regime (1962-1987). After his release from detention in October 1966, Ba Swe lived quietly in Rangoon, removed from political activity but witnessing the transformation of Burma under military socialism—an ideology quite different from the democratic Buddhist socialism he had advocated.[^79] He died in Rangoon on December 6, 1987, at the age of 72, just months before the pro-democracy uprising of 1988 that would challenge military rule.[^80]

## Legacy

Thakin Ba Swe's legacy is complex and contested, reflecting both his genuine contributions to Burma's independence struggle and his role in the political crisis that facilitated military dictatorship. He stands as a significant figure in the pantheon of Burmese nationalist leaders, though not at the same level of reverence accorded to Aung San or even U Nu.[^81]

Ba Swe's most enduring intellectual legacy is his pioneering work in synthesizing Buddhist philosophy with Marxist ideology. His efforts to create a distinctly Burmese form of socialism influenced subsequent generations of political thinkers, even if the military's later "Burmese Way to Socialism" under Ne Win bore little resemblance to Ba Swe's democratic vision.[^82] The attempt to reconcile indigenous philosophical traditions with modern political ideologies remains relevant to contemporary debates about Asian values and political development.[^83]

As a leader of the independence movement, Ba Swe's contributions were substantial. His activism as a student leader, his role in founding the Burma Socialist Party, and his participation in the Anti-Fascist Organisation's resistance to Japanese occupation established him as one of the "Thirty Comrades" generation—the cohort of nationalist leaders who brought Burma to independence.[^84] His work in building the organizational structures of the AFPFL and the Socialist Party provided crucial institutional foundations for post-colonial governance.[^85]

However, Ba Swe's legacy is significantly tarnished by the 1958 AFPFL split. Historians continue to debate whether his confrontation with U Nu was a principled stand against corruption and ineffective leadership or an ambitious power grab that destabilized Burmese democracy.[^86] What is indisputable is that the split created the conditions for military intervention, and the precedent set by Ne Win's 1958-1960 caretaker government paved the way for the 1962 coup that ended parliamentary democracy in Burma for decades.[^87]

The devastating 1960 election defeat demonstrated that Ba Swe had miscalculated public sentiment badly. The Burmese electorate overwhelmingly rejected the Stable AFPFL, suggesting that ordinary citizens viewed Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein as representing factional interests rather than national welfare.[^88] This electoral repudiation diminished Ba Swe's political authority and ended his relevance as a national leader.[^89]

In contemporary Myanmar, Ba Swe is remembered primarily by historians and political scientists rather than being a figure of popular memory or commemoration.[^90] Unlike Aung San, whose legacy as the father of independence remains central to Burmese national identity, or even U Nu, who is remembered for his Buddhist devotion and democratic principles, Ba Swe occupies a more ambiguous position.[^91] He is recognized as an important political leader of the independence generation but not celebrated as a national hero.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars sympathetic to Ba Swe emphasize his genuine commitment to creating a socialism adapted to Burmese conditions and his intellectual seriousness in grappling with the challenge of reconciling Buddhist philosophy with Marxist economic analysis.[^93] His 1957 book "The Burmese Revolution" and his 1946 speech "Guide for the Socialist Party of Burma" represent significant contributions to socialist theory in Asia, demonstrating that Burmese intellectuals were not merely importing European ideologies but actively engaging in creative synthesis.[^94]

Defenders of Ba Swe argue that his role in founding the Burma Socialist Party was crucial to preventing a communist takeover of the AFPFL and ensuring that Burma's path to socialism would be democratic rather than totalitarian.[^95] By providing an alternative to both the Communist Party of Burma and conservative elements, the Socialist Party under Ba Swe's leadership created space for democratic socialism in Burmese politics.[^96] This "Third Camp" position allowed Burma to maintain independence during the Cold War and avoid becoming a satellite of either superpower bloc.[^97]

Some historians view the 1958 AFPFL split more sympathetically to Ba Swe, arguing that U Nu's leadership had become ineffective and that the Clean AFPFL's Buddhist socialism was becoming increasingly disconnected from practical governance.[^98] From this perspective, Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein represented a more pragmatic, administratively competent approach that might have stabilized Burma if given the opportunity.[^99] The fact that U Nu himself invited military intervention suggests that the political crisis was not solely Ba Swe's fault.[^100]

Ba Swe's brief tenure as Prime Minister (1956-1957) is generally viewed positively by historians, with no major scandals or policy failures recorded during his nine months in office.[^101] He maintained continuity with established AFPFL policies while demonstrating administrative competence.[^102] His willingness to step down and allow U Nu to resume the premiership demonstrated a commitment to democratic norms and party discipline that stands in contrast to many post-colonial leaders who refused to relinquish power.[^103]

### Negative Views

Critics of Ba Swe emphasize his role in splitting the AFPFL and creating the political instability that facilitated military intervention.[^104] From this perspective, personal ambition and factional rivalry took precedence over national interest, with catastrophic consequences for Burmese democracy.[^105] The 1960 electoral landslide against the Stable AFPFL is cited as evidence that the Burmese people themselves rejected Ba Swe's political judgment.[^106]

Some scholars are skeptical of Ba Swe's Buddhist-Marxist synthesis, viewing it as an intellectually incoherent attempt to reconcile fundamentally incompatible worldviews.[^107] Orthodox Marxists criticize the incorporation of Buddhist concepts as diluting the materialist and scientific character of Marxism, while traditional Buddhists object to subordinating the Dhamma to political ideology.[^108] From this viewpoint, Ba Swe's theoretical work was more rhetorical than substantive—an attempt to make socialism palatable to a Buddhist society rather than a genuine philosophical synthesis.[^109]

Critics also point to Ba Swe's pro-Mao sympathies as evidence of poor political judgment.[^110] His public expressions of support for Maoist China are seen as naive and potentially dangerous, particularly given China's later support for the Communist Party of Burma's insurgency against the Burmese government.[^111] The suggestion that Ba Swe's ideological commitments might have compromised Burma's genuinely non-aligned position raises questions about his suitability for national leadership.[^112]

The devastating 1960 election defeat is interpreted by critics as proof that Ba Swe and Kyaw Nyein had lost touch with popular sentiment and that their Stable AFPFL represented bureaucratic self-interest rather than genuine socialist principles.[^113] The electoral verdict suggests that ordinary Burmese citizens saw through the factional maneuvering and rejected leaders who prioritized political power over national unity.[^114]

Finally, some historians argue that Ba Swe's political legacy is essentially negative—he helped destabilize parliamentary democracy without offering a viable alternative, contributed to conditions that enabled military dictatorship, and then faded into political irrelevance.[^115] Unlike Aung San, who died as a martyr for independence, or U Nu, who continued to advocate for democracy even during military rule, Ba Swe's political career ended not with principle but with defeat and detention.[^116]
