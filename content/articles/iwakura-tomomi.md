## Summary

Iwakura Tomomi (1825-1883) was one of Japan's most influential statesmen of the 19th century and a pivotal architect of the Meiji Restoration.[^1] Born into a lower-ranking noble family and adopted by a court noble, he orchestrated the January 3, 1868 seizure of the Imperial Palace that initiated the Meiji Restoration and ended centuries of shogunate rule.[^2] As Minister of the Right, he led the famous Iwakura Mission (1871-1873), an extraordinary diplomatic expedition to the United States and Europe that profoundly shaped Japan's modernization strategy.[^3] His conservative constitutional vision favoring the Prussian model over democratic systems defined Japan's political structure for decades, though this same conservatism made him a target of assassination attempts by disenfranchised samurai who opposed his policies.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Iwakura Tomomi was born on October 26, 1825, in Kyoto, Japan, as the second son of Horikawa Yasuchika, a low-ranking courtier and nobleman.[^5] His childhood name was Kanemaru, but fellow court nobles called him Iwakichi, typically thought of as a commoner's name, reflecting his family's modest status within the aristocracy.[^6] Despite his family's lower position in the court hierarchy, Iwakura possessed important imperial connections through his mother, making him a first cousin of Emperor Ninkō and a descendant of the 10th-century Emperor Murakami.[^7]

In 1838, the thirteen-year-old Kanemaru was adopted by Iwakura Tomoyasu, a leading court noble, following the recommendation of Confucian scholar Fusehara Nobuharu, who had taught the boy Confucianism from childhood and recognized his intellectual gifts.[^8] Upon adoption, he changed his name from Kanemaru to Tomomi and took the Iwakura family name.[^9] However, the Iwakura house had relatively lower status among the 137 court nobles of the bakumatsu period, as it had only become independent from the Koga house in the early Edo period and did not have a family business, leaving them with little money despite their noble status.[^10]

Tomomi was described as a bit of an eccentric child from a young age, and his bold ideas and comments made him stand out from others, though he was brilliant.[^11] Although he came from a noble family, contemporary accounts suggest his behavior was not typical of aristocratic bearing, a characteristic that would later serve him well as a political operator who could navigate between the rarefied world of the imperial court and the practical concerns of domain samurai.[^12] His education in Confucianism provided him with the intellectual framework that would inform his political thinking throughout his career, particularly his views on hierarchy, governance, and the relationship between ruler and ruled.[^13]

In 1854, Iwakura became Imperial Chamberlain, marking his entry into active political service at the court.[^14] This position placed him at the heart of the imperial household during one of the most tumultuous periods in Japanese history, as the country faced unprecedented pressure from Western powers to end its centuries-long policy of isolation. His early career was marked by a growing awareness of the foreign threat to Japan and the need for the imperial court to reassert its authority over national affairs, which had been largely usurped by the Tokugawa shogunate for over two centuries.[^15]

## Rise to Power

Iwakura Tomomi's path to political prominence was circuitous and marked by both dramatic setbacks and remarkable comebacks. His first major involvement in national politics came in 1858, when he became influential in Emperor Kōmei's refusal to ratify the U.S.-Japanese treaty of commerce, expressing his concern that before any treaty could be signed, Japan needed to learn about the situation and customs of foreign countries.[^16] This early stance demonstrated both his nationalist sentiments and his pragmatic recognition of Japan's need to understand the West before engaging with it—a theme that would define his later career.[^17]

However, Iwakura's political maneuvering soon brought him into conflict with radical elements at court. Intending to bridge the divide between the shogunate and the imperial court, Iwakura openly supported the marriage between Tokugawa Iemochi, the shogun, and Emperor Kōmei's younger sister Princess Kazunomiya.[^18] Iwakura suggested that the emperor allow this marriage with the condition that the shogunate take steps to rescind all treaties with foreign powers, thereby recognizing the dominance of the court in diplomatic affairs.[^19] This pragmatic approach, which sought to use the marriage alliance to increase imperial influence, earned him derision as a shogunate supporter among more radical anti-shogunate activists.[^20]

In 1862, Iwakura was reproached by the sonnō jōi group (supporters of the doctrine of revering the emperor and expelling the barbarians) as one of the "Four Wilies" and was subsequently exiled and confined.[^21] Those who supported the more radical Sonnō jōi movement to overthrow the Tokugawa shogunate and reinstate the power of the emperor saw Iwakura as a supporter of the Shogunate and put pressure on the court to expel him.[^22] Emperor Kōmei insisted that Iwakura was innocent but could not stop those who would threaten him, including the radical activist Takechi Hanpeita.[^23]

From 1862 to 1867, Iwakura lived in obscurity and exile, initially at Reigen Temple in the Nishigamo district before moving to Saiho Temple, and ultimately borrowing the abandoned home of a man named Fujiya Togoro in Northern Kyoto's Iwakura Village.[^24] However, this period of exile was far from idle retirement. Despite being out of favor at court, Iwakura wrote many opinions and sent them to the Court or his political companions in Satsuma Domain.[^25] In 1865, for example, Iwakura showed 'Sōrimeichū' (叢裡鳴虫), a written opinion, to Ōkubo Toshimichi and Komatsu Tatewaki from Satsuma Domain, maintaining his network of political contacts and continuing to influence events behind the scenes.[^26]

Iwakura's exile ended in 1867, when shifting political winds brought him back to court.[^27] He returned at a critical moment, as the shogunate was weakening and anti-Tokugawa forces were gaining strength. Following his release from confinement, Iwakura emerged as a pivotal intermediary between the imperial court and anti-Tokugawa samurai domains, leveraging his courtier status to align imperial authority with domain military power.[^28] This role was essential amid the shogunate's declining control, as Iwakura cultivated ties with loyalist leaders in Satsuma and Chōshū domains.[^29]

The culmination of Iwakura's political maneuvering came in late 1867 and early 1868. Iwakura Tomomi, Saigō Takamori, and Ōkubo Toshimichi spent the months of November and December 1867 organizing a coup d'état within the divided Imperial Court, following the shogun's resignation in November.[^30] On January 3, 1868, Iwakura secretly communicated with Ōkubo Toshimichi and Saigō Takamori, leaders of the movement to overthrow the shogunate, to help them engineer the seizure of the Imperial Palace in Kyōto.[^31] In the early hours of that day, domain troops seized control of the Imperial Palace from the bakufu while Iwakura simultaneously received official approval from the Emperor for these actions.[^32] The following day, January 4, 1868, the fifteen-year-old Emperor Meiji declared his own restoration to full power, marking the beginning of the Meiji Restoration.[^33]

As the only court noble in the early Meiji government, Iwakura was described as shrewd and cunning but instrumental in mediating between Satsuma and Chōshū—two powerful domains that had historically been rivals but whose cooperation was essential for the success of the restoration.[^34] This unique position as the bridge between the imperial court's traditional authority and the military power of the southwestern domains made Iwakura indispensable to the new government.[^35]

## Major Achievements

Iwakura Tomomi's career in the Meiji government was marked by several transformative achievements that fundamentally reshaped Japanese society and governance. His contributions spanned constitutional development, administrative reforms, and diplomatic initiatives that positioned Japan for its rapid modernization.

### The Charter Oath and Constitutional Foundations

One of Iwakura's earliest and most significant contributions was his primary responsibility for drafting the Charter Oath (五箇条の御誓文 Gokajō no Goseimon, "Oath in Five Articles"), which was promulgated at the enthronement of Emperor Meiji on April 6, 1868, in the Kyōto Imperial Palace.[^36] This document established the ideological foundation for Japan's modernization and represented a remarkable vision for a new Japan.[^37] The Charter Oath's five provisions consisted of establishment of deliberative assemblies, involvement of all classes in carrying out state affairs, freedom of social and occupational mobility, replacement of "evil customs" with the "just laws of nature," and an international search for knowledge to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule.[^38]

The Oath was reiterated as the first article of the constitution promulgated in June 1868, and the subsequent articles of that constitution expanded the policies outlined in the Oath.[^39] This short-lived constitution was drawn up to implement the Charter Oath's principles, though it would eventually be superseded by the more comprehensive Meiji Constitution of 1889.[^40] Iwakura's role in crafting this foundational document demonstrated his understanding that Japan's transformation required not just military or technological modernization but a complete reimagining of the relationship between the state and its people.[^41]

### Abolition of the Han System

Iwakura played a crucial role in one of the Meiji government's most radical reforms: the abolition of the feudal domain (han) system that had characterized Japanese governance for centuries.[^42] The Meiji Restoration saw the abolition of feudalism, the domain system, and the samurai class—changes in which Iwakura was a leading figure.[^43] In 1869, the movement to abolish the han was spearheaded by Kido Takayoshi of the Chōshū Domain, with backing from court nobles Iwakura Tomomi and Sanjō Sanetomi.[^44] Iwakura drafted a compromise proposal in July 1869, where the daimyō would retain their land under the title of governor or vice-governor, with 10% of their domain revenues sent to the Court.[^45]

However, this compromise proved temporary. In August 1871, Iwakura Tomomi, along with Ōkubo Toshimichi, Saigō Takamori, Kido Takayoshi, and Yamagata Aritomo, forced through an Imperial Edict which reorganized the 261 surviving ex-feudal domains into three urban prefectures and 302 prefectures.[^46] Remarkably, major government members like Sanjō Sanetomi were not even informed of the plan until August 27, two days before it was set to go ahead, illustrating the decisive and sometimes autocratic nature of early Meiji governance.[^47] The abolition of the han system in 1871 was the culmination of the Meiji Restoration begun in 1868, replacing the old feudal system with a centralized government and marking a fundamental transformation of Japanese political structure.[^48]

### The Iwakura Mission: Japan's Great Learning Expedition

Iwakura's most famous achievement was leading the diplomatic expedition that bears his name. In 1871, soon after his appointment to udaijin (右大臣, Minister of the Right), he was asked to lead a mission abroad to observe the political and social institutions of Europe and the United States.[^49] On December 23, 1871, an expedition of 100 Japanese leaders, government officials, and students set sail from Yokohama on the SS America, bound for San Francisco.[^50] The delegation included over fifty core officials and scholars, though the full group, including students and support staff, numbered more than one hundred.[^51]

The mission was named after and headed by Iwakura Tomomi in the role of extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, assisted by four vice-ambassadors, three of whom (Ōkubo Toshimichi, Kido Takayoshi, and Itō Hirobumi) were also ministers in the Japanese government.[^52] The aim of the mission was threefold: to gain recognition for the newly reinstated imperial dynasty under Emperor Meiji; to begin preliminary renegotiation of the unequal treaties with the dominant world powers; and to make a comprehensive study of modern industrial, political, military and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe.[^53]

During the 18 months of this expedition, which lasted until September 13, 1873, when the mission returned to Yokohama, Iwakura led the group through an intensive study of Western civilization.[^54] The delegation came to understand that modernization required both technology and a total restructuring of Japanese society and government.[^55] Mission members studied various aspects of Western society, including educational systems—observing how universal schooling in Prussia produced disciplined citizens, and how British universities contributed to economic development through scientific research—as well as manufacturing facilities, railways, communications facilities, coal mines, ironworks, machine shops, and even beer and biscuit factories.[^56]

Members of the mission were favorably impressed by industrial modernization seen in America and Europe, and the experience of the tour provided them a strong impetus to lead similar modernization initiatives on their return.[^57] Iwakura himself, who had initially hesitated to embrace radical change, became a staunch supporter of reform after witnessing the organization and prosperity of Western societies.[^58] The knowledge gained from the Iwakura Mission played a critical role in shaping Japan's modernization policies, helping Japan to emerge as a major world power by the early 20th century.[^59] The log of the expedition was published in 1878 in five volumes as Tokumei Zenken Taishi Bei-O Kairan Jikki, providing a detailed account of Japanese observations on the United States and rapidly industrializing Western Europe.[^60]

It is no overstatement to say that Japan's modernization began with the Iwakura Mission, which marks a significant shift in Japan's development, as the country was cultivating diplomatic relationships with other parts of the world and implementing Western systems based on Iwakura's observations.[^61] The mission is considered one of the most significant diplomatic expeditions in Japanese history and possibly the most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West.[^62]

### Opposition to the Korean Expedition and Domestic Focus

Upon his return from the West in 1873, Iwakura faced a major political crisis that would test his influence and shape Japan's foreign policy direction. When the mission returned to Japan, Iwakura vehemently opposed the plans that Saigō Takamori and others in Japan's caretaker government had made in his absence to dispatch a military expedition to Korea.[^63] Iwakura helped thwart plans made during his absence for war with Korea, as he was convinced that internal reforms were vitally needed.[^64] He argued that it was essential to strengthen the country internally before embarking on foreign adventures—a position informed by his observations during the Iwakura Mission of how Western nations had built their power through internal development before external expansion.[^65]

This opposition to the Korean expedition led to a major political crisis known as the Seikan Ronsou (debate on subjugation of Korea) in October 1873. The resignation of pro-Korea war councilors including Takamori Saigo, Shinpei Eto, and Taisuke Itagaki following their defeat in this debate made fuhei shizoku (former samurai with gripes) even more frustrated, and resentment against Tomomi Iwakura and Toshimichi Okubo, who led the opposition, increasingly grew.[^66] This policy dispute had far-reaching consequences, not only shaping Japan's immediate foreign policy but also creating deep divisions within the political elite that would lead to violence.[^67]

### Constitutional Development and the Prussian Model

Most notably, Iwakura spent his last years in office advocating for Western-influenced financial system reforms and initiating the creation of the Imperial Constitution as well as a limited parliamentary democracy system.[^68] In 1880, Minister of the Right Iwakura Tomomi ordered every vice-minister to draw up and submit a written opinion on the constitution.[^69] Based on his experiences gathered in the West, he acknowledged the advantages of adopting a constitutional system to achieve parity with Western nations, and in 1881, he ordered Inoue Kowashi to draw up guiding principles for a Japanese constitution.[^70]

Iwakura was highly conservative in outlook; his most important achievement in this area was to advocate the establishment of a new constitutional order on the Prussian model: the promulgation of a constitution by the emperor, the vesting of most state powers in the imperial institution, and the assignment of a weak role to the popularly elected legislature.[^71] Rejecting the British model, Iwakura and other conservatives borrowed heavily from the Prussian constitutional system, believing that the Prussian constitution provided a better model for Japan than the constitutions of more democratically liberal England, France, and the United States.[^72] 

This preference was based on several factors: Prussia had a history that presented a number of similarities to Japan—its government was a monarchy with a strong central government, its economy was late to industrialize, and its people were fearful of excessive political freedom.[^73] When a conflict arose with a party that favored something similar to England's constitutional model, Iwakura arranged for the dismissal of Ōkuma Shigenobu, one of the leaders of that rival faction, claiming that a British-style constitution would strip power away from the sovereign.[^74] The draft committee included Inoue Kowashi, Kaneko Kentarō, Itō Miyoji and Iwakura Tomomi, along with a number of foreign advisors, particularly the German legal scholars Rudolf von Gneist and Lorenz von Stein.[^75]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his pivotal role in modernizing Japan, Iwakura Tomomi's career was marked by significant controversies that made him a polarizing figure, earning him both admiration and violent opposition from different segments of Japanese society.

### Early Support for Shogunate and Exile

Iwakura's first major controversy arose from his pragmatic attempt to bridge the divide between the imperial court and the Tokugawa shogunate. His open support for the marriage between Tokugawa Iemochi and Emperor Kōmei's younger sister Princess Kazunomiya earned him derision as a shogunate supporter and led to his exile in 1862.[^76] He was reproached by the sonnō jōi group as one of the "Four Wilies" and was confined until 1867.[^77] To radical activists who favored immediate confrontation with the shogunate, Iwakura's attempt at compromise appeared as betrayal of the imperial cause, leading to his political isolation during a crucial five-year period.[^78]

### The Kuichigai Incident: Assassination Attempt of 1874

The most dramatic manifestation of opposition to Iwakura came on January 14, 1874, in what became known as the Kuichigai Incident—an assassination attempt that nearly cost him his life.[^79] The resignation of pro-Korea war councilors including Takamori Saigo, Shinpei Eto, and Taisuke Itagaki following their defeat in the Seikan Ronsou in October 1873 had made fuhei shizoku (former samurai with gripes) even more frustrated, and resentment against Iwakura and Okubo, who led the debate, increasingly grew.[^80]

On the night of January 14, 1874, when Iwakura finished his work and left the temporal imperial palace for his home, he was attacked by assailants when his horse-drawn buggy reached Kuichigaizaka in Akasaka.[^81] The assault team consisted of nine people, including Kumakichi Takechi, a shizoku from Kochi Prefecture who worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and eight others—all bureaucrats or military men who had quit to follow Saigo and Itagaki.[^82] Iwakura was slightly injured below the eyebrow and left hip by the attack but survived because he fell off into the moat of the Imperial Palace, and the assailants lost sight of him.[^83] The nine criminals were arrested three days later on January 17, and all members were punished by decapitation on July 9, 1874.[^84]

On January 14, 1874, Iwakura was attacked by a group of nine disenfranchised shizoku (members of former samurai families) who were all apprehended and sentenced to death; though he escaped with only a slight injury, he was severely perturbed by the incident.[^85] He was seriously wounded by would-be assassins in January 1876 (accounts vary on the exact year) for his role in the decision to oppose a military expedition to Korea.[^86]

### Conservative Constitutional Vision and Opposition to Democratic Rights

A foe of the movement for democratic rights, Iwakura ended his career by supervising the early stages of the preparation of a constitution safeguarding the imperial prerogative.[^87] His highly conservative outlook and advocacy for the Prussian constitutional model with a weak role for the popularly elected legislature put him at odds with advocates for greater democratic participation in government.[^88] He opposed the Freedom and People's Rights Movement, which sought to establish a more liberal constitutional order with meaningful parliamentary power.[^89]

When Ōkuma Shigenobu attempted to secretly influence the emperor toward adopting a British-style constitution—and to do it very rapidly—Iwakura arranged for his dismissal in a very dramatic way that was sure to win support from the conservatives, claiming that a British-style constitution would strip power away from the sovereign.[^90] This episode illustrated Iwakura's willingness to use his influence at court to suppress alternative visions of Japan's political future that conflicted with his own conservative principles.[^91]

### Character Assessments and Political Methods

Contemporary and historical assessments of Iwakura's character reveal a complex figure whose methods were often controversial. He was described as shrewd and cunning, qualities that enabled him to navigate the treacherous politics of the Restoration era but also suggested a willingness to employ deception and manipulation.[^92] His role in various political intrigues, from his exile period through the coup of 1868 to his maneuvering against political rivals like Ōkuma, demonstrated a pragmatic approach to power that prioritized outcomes over transparency.[^93]

## Personal Life

Iwakura Tomomi's personal life reveals dimensions of his character beyond his political accomplishments, including his family relationships, cultural interests, and personal habits that shaped his daily existence.

### Family and Marriage

Iwakura had a wife named Mineko, who died on October 24, 1874, during a particularly turbulent period in his political career shortly after the assassination attempt on his life.[^94] After Mineko's death, he remarried Makiko Noguchi, maintaining the family structure important to a man of his social position.[^95] The couple had several children, including sons Tomosada, Tomotsune, and Michitomo, as well as daughters such as Hiroko (who married into the Mori family) and Kiwako (who married Toda Ujitaka, a samurai descendant).[^96]

Tomomi maintained close ties with his sons and was committed to their education in the new era he was helping to create. He dispatched at least two of his sons—Iwakura Tats and Iwakura Asahi—to study at Rutgers College in the United States during the 1870s, demonstrating his belief in Western education as essential preparation for Japan's future leaders.[^97] This decision reflected the broader philosophy of the Iwakura Mission itself: that Japan must learn from the West to compete with the West.[^98]

Iwakura's daughter-in-law, Iwakura Chisako (1861-1922), was among the first female amateur practitioners of Noh theater, indicating that the family maintained connections to traditional Japanese culture even while embracing modernization.[^99] The Iwakura family's influence extended into later generations; Iwakura Tomomi is an ancestor to actor Ken Uehara, singer Yūzō Kayama, and actress Emi Ikehata, maintaining a presence in Japanese popular culture long after his death.[^100]

### Personal Characteristics and Interests

Iwakura Tomomi's physical stature was modest—his height was about 160 centimeters (approximately 5 feet 3 inches)—which was typical for Japanese men of his era.[^101] His personal habits reflected both traditional Japanese customs and the adaptations required by his health conditions. He used to like Japanese sake and drank around 90 milliliters, three times a day, though because of health conditions and food restrictions, he later had to drink western wine only instead of Japanese sake.[^102]

As noted earlier, Tomomi was described as a bit of an eccentric child from a young age, and his bold ideas and comments made him stand out from others, though he was brilliant.[^103] Although he was from a noble family, contemporary accounts suggest that his behavior was not typical of aristocratic bearing—a characteristic that may have served him well in navigating between the rigid protocol of the imperial court and the more pragmatic world of domain politics and diplomacy.[^104]

### Cultural Patronage

Iwakura was a lifelong patron of Noh theater, the classical Japanese dramatic art form that had been favored by the samurai elite for centuries.[^105] In 1876, he organized the first tenran-no (a performance in the presence of the emperor) of the Meiji era at his private residence, marking an important moment in the restoration of imperial cultural patronage and the revival of traditional arts that had been neglected during the final chaotic years of Tokugawa rule.[^106] This patronage demonstrated that Iwakura's vision of modernization did not require the complete abandonment of Japanese cultural traditions—a more nuanced position than is sometimes attributed to Meiji reformers.[^107]

### Final Days and Death

The emperor personally visited his cousin and old friend on July 19, 1883, moved to tears at Iwakura's condition as he lay dying of throat cancer.[^108] This deeply personal moment between the Emperor and the statesman who had devoted his life to restoring and preserving imperial authority represented a poignant conclusion to their decades-long relationship. Iwakura died the following day, July 20, 1883, at the age of 57, cutting short a career that had fundamentally transformed Japan.[^109]

## Legacy

Iwakura Tomomi's death marked the end of an era, but his influence on Japan's trajectory continued to shape the nation for decades after his passing. His legacy encompasses both his specific achievements and his broader impact on Japan's approach to modernization and governance.

### Immediate Recognition and Honors

He was given a state funeral, the first ever given by the imperial government, marking the significance the Meiji state placed on his contributions.[^110] This unprecedented honor established the precedent for state funerals that would become an important ritual of the modern Japanese state.[^111] He was posthumously promoted to the post of dajodaijin (premier), the highest position in the traditional court hierarchy.[^112] The Emperor's rescript honored him deeply, stating "He was the pillar of the nation and a model for my subjects"—words that captured both his practical importance to the state and his exemplary role in navigating Japan's transformation.[^113]

As a further mark of honor, his son Iwakura Tomosada was in 1884 given the title of duke in the newly created kazoku (peerage) system, ensuring that the Iwakura family would maintain its prominent position in Meiji society.[^114] Following his death in 1883, Iwakura's life and career were recorded in a formal set of handscroll paintings commissioned by the Imperial Court and painted by Tanaka Yûbi, which remain in the Imperial Collections today as a testament to his historical importance.[^115] He was buried in Asamadai, Minami-Shinagawa, at the Kaian-ji Temple in Shinagawa Ward, Tokyo, where his grave became a site of historical remembrance.[^116]

### Impact on Constitutional Development

Iwakura Tomomi's legacy has been evaluated as pivotal in steering Japan toward centralized modernization while preserving imperial sovereignty, with historians crediting him with orchestrating the 1868 Meiji Restoration's consolidation of power and transitioning from feudal domains to a unified state apparatus that enabled rapid industrialization and military reforms.[^117] His advocacy for the Prussian constitutional model fundamentally shaped the Meiji Constitution of 1889, which established a political system that balanced modernization with the preservation of imperial prerogative—a balance that would characterize Japanese governance until 1945.[^118]

The constitutional framework Iwakura championed—with its emphasis on imperial sovereignty, limited parliamentary power, and strong executive authority—created a political structure that enabled rapid state-directed modernization while containing demands for democratic participation.[^119] For better or worse, this system shaped Japan's political development through the imperial period, contributing to both its remarkable achievements in industrialization and military strength and its eventual descent into militarism and war.[^120]

### The Enduring Influence of the Iwakura Mission

The Iwakura Mission's impact on Japanese modernization cannot be overstated. This marks a significant shift in Japan's modernization, as the country was cultivating diplomatic relationships with other parts of the world, and because Iwakura returned to Japan with many ideas and suggestions to implement Western systems in his home country.[^121] The mission established the principle that Japan should learn from the West selectively, adopting those aspects of Western civilization that would strengthen Japan while preserving essential elements of Japanese identity and sovereignty.[^122]

The knowledge gained from the Iwakura Mission played a critical role in shaping Japan's modernization policies, helping Japan to emerge as a major world power by the early 20th century.[^123] Mission members who later held powerful positions in government drew on their observations during the expedition to guide policy in areas ranging from education and infrastructure to military organization and industrial development.[^124] The mission's emphasis on understanding Western systems before adopting them became a hallmark of Japanese modernization, distinguishing Japan's approach from that of other non-Western societies that attempted modernization with less systematic preparation.[^125]

### Cultural and Symbolic Legacy

Iwakura Tomomi's portrait appeared on the discontinued 500 Yen banknote issued by the Bank of Japan, which was first issued in 1951 and circulated until 1994, keeping his image and legacy in the daily consciousness of ordinary Japanese for much of the postwar period.[^126] The Former Retreat of Tomomi Iwakura, his residence during exile in Iwakura Village, has been preserved as a historical site, allowing visitors to connect with this crucial period in his life and in Japanese history.[^127]

### Enduring Debates and Assessment

Debates persist over the balance between internal reform and expansionist impulses in Iwakura's legacy and that of the Meiji government he helped create.[^128] While his opposition to the Korean expedition in 1873 demonstrated a commitment to internal development over external adventure, the constitutional and governmental structures he helped establish would later be used to justify Japanese imperialism and expansion.[^129] Some historians argue that Iwakura's conservative constitutional vision, by limiting democratic accountability, inadvertently contributed to the rise of militarism in the 1930s, while others contend that his framework provided the stability necessary for Japan's initial modernization.[^130]

In the new administration, which used the Meiji emperor's prestige as a force for modernizing Japan, Iwakura was one of the most powerful leaders, and his influence extended far beyond his death.[^131] He was one of Japan's most influential statesmen of the 19th century, and his vision of a centralized, emperor-centered state that could rapidly modernize while preserving Japanese sovereignty and cultural identity fundamentally shaped modern Japan.[^132]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians and scholars have widely recognized Iwakura Tomomi as one of the most important government leaders and influencers of the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and Japan's modernization and exploration of the West.[^133] His leadership of the 1871–1873 Iwakura Mission facilitated direct observation of Western governance, education, and industry, informing policies that prioritized "rich nation, strong army" (fukoku kyōhei) without complete cultural capitulation to Western values.[^134] This balanced approach to modernization—selective adoption of Western techniques while preserving core aspects of Japanese culture and governance—is seen by many scholars as the key to Japan's successful transformation.[^135]

Iwakura's role as a political operator and mediator has earned praise from historians who recognize the practical challenges of orchestrating the Meiji Restoration. As the only court noble in the early Meiji government, his ability to bridge the gap between the ancient imperial court and the pragmatic samurai leaders from Satsuma and Chōshū was instrumental in creating a unified government from diverse and potentially conflicting interests.[^136] His shrewd and cunning political methods, while sometimes controversial, were arguably necessary to navigate the treacherous political landscape of the 1860s and 1870s.[^137]

The Charter Oath, for which Iwakura was primarily responsible, is viewed by many historians as a remarkably progressive document for its time, establishing principles of deliberative governance and social mobility that, even if imperfectly implemented, represented a significant advance over the rigid hierarchy of the Tokugawa period.[^138] Scholars note that without Iwakura's constitutional vision and organizational skills, the Meiji Restoration might have dissolved into chaos or been captured by more radical elements.[^139]

The Iwakura Mission itself is almost universally praised by historians as one of the most significant diplomatic expeditions in world history, with some arguing it is the most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of a non-Western society.[^140] The systematic approach to learning from the West that Iwakura championed—sending Japan's top leaders on an extended study mission rather than relying solely on foreign advisors—demonstrated a level of national commitment to transformation that distinguished Japan from other countries facing Western pressure.[^141]

Scholarly assessments emphasize that Iwakura's legacy is pivotal in steering Japan toward centralized modernization while preserving imperial sovereignty, crediting him with orchestrating the 1868 Meiji Restoration's consolidation of power and transitioning from feudal domains to a unified state apparatus that enabled rapid industrialization and military reforms.[^142] Without the administrative and constitutional frameworks he helped establish, Japan's rapid rise as a major power would likely have been impossible.[^143]

### Negative Views

Despite widespread recognition of his achievements, Iwakura Tomomi has also faced significant criticism from historians and was violently opposed by contemporaries who viewed him as an obstacle to their own visions of Japan's future. His highly conservative outlook and opposition to democratic movements remains a major point of criticism among scholars who emphasize the authoritarian aspects of the Meiji state.[^144]

A foe of the movement for democratic rights, Iwakura ended his career by supervising the early stages of the preparation of a constitution safeguarding the imperial prerogative at the expense of popular sovereignty.[^145] Critics argue that his advocacy for the Prussian constitutional model with a weak role for the popularly elected legislature established an authoritarian framework that limited democratic development in Japan for decades.[^146] His opposition to the Freedom and People's Rights Movement and his maneuvering to dismiss advocates of more liberal constitutional models like Ōkuma Shigenobu demonstrated a willingness to suppress democratic alternatives to his conservative vision.[^147]

Some historians argue that Iwakura's constitutional legacy contributed to the eventual rise of Japanese militarism by creating a system in which military leaders could claim to act in the emperor's name without effective parliamentary oversight.[^148] The very features Iwakura saw as strengths—strong executive authority, limited democratic accountability, and reverence for imperial prerogative—became vulnerabilities that were exploited by militarists in the 1930s.[^149]

Contemporary opposition to Iwakura was fierce among disenfranchised samurai and advocates for Korean intervention. Some viewed him negatively, with dissidents even attempting to assassinate him as the government official they deemed responsible for the failure to invade Korea.[^150] These assassination attempts reflect the deep anger felt by former samurai who saw Iwakura's policies—particularly the abolition of the han system and opposition to military adventure in Korea—as betrayals of samurai values and opportunities.[^151]

Debates persist over the balance between internal reform and expansionist impulses in Iwakura's legacy.[^152] While he opposed the Korean expedition in 1873, arguing for internal development first, critics note that this was tactical rather than principled opposition to expansion—he wanted Japan to be stronger before engaging in imperialism, not to avoid imperialism altogether.[^153] The governmental and ideological structures he created would later enable and justify Japanese expansion into Korea, Taiwan, and eventually much of East Asia.[^154]

Some scholars have questioned whether Iwakura's approach to modernization was unnecessarily authoritarian, suggesting that a more democratic constitutional framework might have enabled modernization while avoiding some of the excesses of the later imperial period.[^155] His characterization as "shrewd and cunning" can be read not just as political skill but as a willingness to employ manipulative tactics that undermined transparency and accountability in governance.[^156]

## Famous Quotes

> "We have found friendship at every turn and hope that you may one day visit Japan so that we may return your kindness and hospitality."

Spoken upon leaving Manchester in October 1872 during the Iwakura Mission, these words reflected both diplomatic courtesy and genuine appreciation for the reception the Japanese delegation received. They also expressed Iwakura's vision of reciprocal exchange between Japan and the West, not mere one-way learning.[^157]

> "So far as each people's earning an independent livelihood is concerned … the larger countries are not to be feared and the smaller ones are not to be despised."

This statement reflected Iwakura's philosophy that national strength was not simply a matter of size but of development and organization. It demonstrated his belief that Japan, though smaller than Western powers, could achieve comparable strength through proper modernization.[^158]

> "In both Britain and France, for example, civilisation flourishes and industry and commerce prosper together. However, when one looks at the products of Belgium and Switzerland [one is aware that] the achievements of their peoples in attaining independence and accumulating wealth would impress even the largest nation."

This observation from the Iwakura Mission revealed his analytical approach to understanding Western power. By noting the success of smaller European nations like Belgium and Switzerland, he argued that Japan's relatively small size was no barrier to achieving prosperity and independence.[^159]

> "Before any treaty could be signed, Japan needed to learn about the situation and customs of foreign countries."

This pragmatic statement from 1858 demonstrated Iwakura's early recognition that Japan needed knowledge of the outside world before engaging with it—a principle that would later inform the entire purpose of the Iwakura Mission.[^160]

> "It is essential to strengthen the country internally before embarking on foreign adventures."

Iwakura's argument against the proposed Korean expedition in 1873 reflected his conviction, strengthened by observing Western nations during his mission, that successful external power projection required a strong internal foundation. This principle of "internal development first" would guide Japanese policy in the immediate aftermath of the Restoration, though it would later give way to expansionism.[^161]
