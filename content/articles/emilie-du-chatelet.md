## Summary

Émilie du Châtelet translated Newton's Principia Mathematica into French (the standard French edition still used today) and proposed that kinetic energy is proportional to the square of velocity (E∝mv²), anticipating the concept of conservation of energy. She was one of the most important female scientists of the Enlightenment and a pioneer of Newtonian physics in France.
