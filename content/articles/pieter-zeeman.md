## Summary

Pieter Zeeman was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in Physics with Hendrik Lorentz for the discovery of the Zeeman effect — the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field. This discovery provided evidence for the existence of electron spin and became an important tool in atomic physics and astrophysics for measuring magnetic fields.
