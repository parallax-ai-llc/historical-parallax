## Summary

Choe Je-u (Ch'oe Che-u) was the founder of Donghak (Eastern Learning), later called Cheondogyo (Religion of the Heavenly Way). He claimed to have received a divine revelation in 1860 that proclaimed the inherent dignity of all human beings and the unity of heaven and humanity. His teachings combined elements of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Korean shamanism. He was executed by the Joseon government for propagating a 'false teaching.'
