## Overview

On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated while riding in a presidential motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas. The 35th President of the United States, just 46 years old, was struck by rifle fire and died shortly after at Parkland Memorial Hospital. The assassination shocked the world and became one of the most analyzed events in American history, spawning endless investigations, conspiracy theories, and cultural impact. The official conclusion—that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone—remains contested by much of the American public.

**Critics:**
