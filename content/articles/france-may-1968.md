## Summary

In May 1968, France exploded. What began as student protests at a suburban Paris university transformed within a month into the largest general strike in French history. Ten million workers walked off their jobs. Factories were occupied. Universities were seized. For a few exhilarating weeks, it appeared that the entire social order might collapse—that revolution was actually possible in a modern Western democracy.[^1]

The students demanded everything: an end to American imperialism in Vietnam, sexual liberation, the overthrow of bourgeois society, and above all, the right to imagine. "Be realistic—demand the impossible," read the graffiti on Paris walls. "It is forbidden to forbid." The workers wanted higher wages and shorter hours now, but beneath the surface, something deeper stirred: a rejection of the paternalistic, hierarchical France that Charles de Gaulle represented.[^2]

In the end, the revolution did not happen. De Gaulle disappeared for a day, terrifying his own government, then returned to call elections he knew he would win. The strikes ended. Students returned to class. France went back to normal—or so it seemed. But May 1968 changed French society forever: its culture, its attitudes toward authority, its sexuality, its sense of what was possible. It was a revolution that failed politically but succeeded culturally.[^3]

## Historical Background

### De Gaulle's France

By 1968, Charles de Gaulle had led France for a decade:

- **The hero:** Wartime leader of Free France; national icon
- **Fifth Republic:** Constitution created for him in 1958
- **Authoritarian democracy:** Strong executive; weak parliament
- **Economic modernization:** France prospering but transforming
- **Cultural conservatism:** State television censored; society traditional

The man who had saved France in 1940 now seemed to many a relic of the past.[^4]

### Generational Tension

A new generation was coming of age:

- **Baby boomers:** Post-war children now in their 20s
- **Population explosion:** University enrollment tripled in a decade
- **New media:** Ready access to news, music, ideas
- **Vietnam War:** American imperialism as global issue
- **Global movements:** Civil rights in US; Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia; protests worldwide

The young had no memory of the war. De Gaulle's glory meant nothing to them. They wanted their own world.[^5]

### University Crisis

French universities in 1968 were overcrowded and outdated:

- **Nanterre University:** New campus in Parisian suburb; poorly designed; facilities inadequate
- **Sorbonne:** Ancient, prestigious, rigid
- **Students:** 500,000 nationally; packed into spaces designed for far fewer
- **Rules:** Authoritarian administration; male students forbidden from female dormitories
- **Disconnect:** Curriculum irrelevant; professors distant; future uncertain[^6]

---

## The Events

### Nanterre: The Spark

**March 22, 1968:**
- Students at Nanterre occupied administration building
- Led by Daniel Cohn-Bendit, known as "Dany le Rouge" (Danny the Red)
- Protested police presence, Vietnam War, and university conditions
- **March 22 Movement** born

**April-May:**
- Protests continued; authorities threatened closure
- **May 2:** Nanterre closed

**May 3:** Students gathered at Sorbonne in solidarity
- Police entered campus—unprecedented violation of university autonomy
- Clashes erupted
- Hundreds arrested
- Sorbonne closed[^7]

### The Night of the Barricades

**May 10-11, 1968:**

The police action that was meant to end the protests transformed them into something larger.

**Evening of May 10:**
- 20,000 students gathered in Latin Quarter
- Police blocked all exits
- Students began building barricades in streets of Paris
- **Cobblestones torn up** (later iconic: "Sous les pavés, la plage"—"Under the paving stones, the beach")

**Night:**
- Police charged repeatedly with tear gas and batons
- Violent clashes until 5:30 AM
- **367 injured** (official figure; actual much higher)
- **460 arrested**
- Dozens of cars burned
- Latin Quarter looked like a war zone

**The images shocked France.** Radio stations broadcast live. Parents heard their children being beaten. Public opinion shifted dramatically in favor of the students.[^8]

### The General Strike

**May 13:**
The trade unions—CGT (Communist), CFDT, FO—called a one-day general strike in solidarity with students.

**Over 1 million marched in Paris.** Workers and students together.

**But then something unexpected happened: workers didn't go back.**

**May 14:**
- Sud-Aviation factory near Nantes occupied by workers
- Management locked in offices

**May 15:**
- Renault factories occupied
- Citroën, other major industries followed

**May 17-20:**
- Strike spread nationwide
- **Ten million workers** on strike—the largest in French history
- Transportation halted
- Mail stopped
- Garbage piled in streets
- Fuel shortages
- France paralyzed

**Not led by unions:** The strikes were wildcat, spontaneous. Workers demanded:
- 35% wage increase
- 40-hour workweek
- Retirement at 60
- Union rights expansion
- And something harder to define: dignity, control, change[^9]

### Revolutionary Moment?

**May 20-30:**
For ten days, France seemed on the brink of revolution:

**Occupied spaces:**
- Sorbonne: 24-hour debates, art, music
- Odéon Theatre: Seized; endless assemblies
- Factories flying red flags
- Radio stations broadcasting uncensored

**Atmosphere:**
- Festival of ideas
- Sexual liberation
- Artistic experimentation
- "L'imagination au pouvoir" (Power to the imagination)

**Famous graffiti:**
- "Be realistic—demand the impossible"
- "It is forbidden to forbid"
- "Under the paving stones, the beach"
- "Run, comrade, the old world is behind you"

**But questions loomed:**
- What were the demands?
- Who was leading?
- Was there a revolutionary organization?
- Would the military intervene?[^10]

### De Gaulle's Crisis

**May 24:**
- De Gaulle addressed nation on television
- Proposed referendum on reform
- Speech fell flat; protests continued

**May 25-27:**
- Prime Minister Georges Pompidou negotiated with unions
- **Grenelle Accords:** 35% minimum wage increase; 10% average wage increase; shorter hours
- But workers rejected the deal; wanted more

**May 29:** De Gaulle disappeared.

**Nobody knew where he was.** The government panicked. Was he resigning? Dying? Fleeing?

**Actually:** He flew secretly to Baden-Baden, Germany, to French military headquarters. He needed to ensure the army's loyalty—and perhaps his own nerve.

**General Massu reassured him:** The army would support him.

**May 30:** De Gaulle returned and addressed the nation by radio:
- Announced dissolution of National Assembly
- Called new elections
- Warned of Communist takeover
- Rallied the "silent majority"

**That afternoon:** Nearly 1 million Gaullists marched on the Champs-Élysées. The counter-revolution had begun.[^11]

---

## The End

### June 1968

**The tide turned:**
- Workers gradually returned to jobs (with Grenelle benefits)
- Students dispersed
- Police cleared occupied buildings
- Fuel restored; trains ran

**June 23 and 30:** Elections held
- Gaullists won massive majority: 358 of 487 seats
- Biggest landslide in French history
- Communist Party punished for appearing revolutionary
- France voted for order

**The revolution was over—or never happened.**[^12]

---

## Casualties

**Deaths:** Officially 7 (some estimates higher)
- Several in various incidents during the weeks of unrest
- Including a police officer drowned in the Seine
- A student died in Lyon

**Injured:** 2,500+ (official figures likely undercount)

**Arrested:** 4,000+ during the events

**Remarkable:** Given the scale and intensity, remarkably few deaths. Neither side sought massacre; this was not 1871.[^13]

## What Was at Stake?

### Workers' Demands

- University reform
- End authoritarianism

**Some were achieved; others were dreams**

### Revolutionary Possibility?

**Could it have succeeded?**

Arguments against:

- Army loyal to de Gaulle
- No clear alternative government
- Majority of French wanted order

Arguments for:
- State was paralyzed for weeks
- De Gaulle nearly resigned
- If Communist Party had joined...
- Historical contingency[^14]

---

## Aftermath

### Immediate

**De Gaulle's fall:**
- Won the election, but authority weakened
- April 1969: Lost a referendum on reform
- Resigned immediately
- Died in November 1970

**University reform:**
- Faure Law (1968) decentralized universities
- More student participation established
- But fundamental structures remained

**Economic:**
- Wage increases achieved (Grenelle)
- But inflation followed
- Workers gained in short term[^15]

### Long-Term Transformation

**What May '68 actually changed:**

**Culture:**
- End of paternalistic authority
- Sexual revolution accelerated
- Feminism strengthened (though male-dominated in '68)
- Youth culture legitimized
- Media freed from state control

**Politics:**
- Rise of "New Left" movements

- Feminism
- LGBT rights (later)
- Regionalism

**The revolution failed politically but succeeded culturally. French society in 1978 was unrecognizably different from 1958.**[^16]

## Historical Assessment

### Conservative View

The events of May 1968 were:
- Irresponsible utopian fantasy
- Threat to order and democracy
- Beginning of moral decline
- Students were privileged ingrates

**Nicolas Sarkozy (2007):** "We must liquidate the heritage of May '68"

### Progressive View

The events were:
- Genuine popular uprising
- Expansion of freedom and rights
- Critique of authoritarianism
- Model for future movements

**Celebrated:** Every anniversary renews debates

### Scholarly Consensus

- More than a student movement: A social crisis
- Not truly revolutionary: No alternative power structure
- Culturally transformative: Changed attitudes permanently
- Symptom of global 1968: Connected to Prague, Mexico City, Tokyo, Chicago[^17]
