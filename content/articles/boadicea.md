## Summary

Boudica (also spelled Boudicca, Boadicea, c. 30-61 CE) was queen of the Iceni tribe in Roman Britain who led a major uprising against the Roman occupation in 60-61 CE. After her husband King Prasutagus died, leaving his kingdom jointly to Rome and his daughters, Roman officials ignored the will, seized Iceni lands, had Boudica flogged, and her daughters raped. In revenge, Boudica united the Iceni and neighboring tribes, leading an army that sacked Camulodunum (Colchester), Londinium (London), and Verulamium (St Albans), killing 70,000-80,000 Romans and Britons. Though eventually defeated by Roman forces under Governor Suetonius Paulinus, Boudica remains a powerful symbol of British resistance, female warrior leadership, and the struggle against oppression.

## Historical Context: Roman Britain

**Roman Invasion (43 CE):**
- Emperor Claudius invaded Britain
- Southern Britain gradually conquered
- Client kingdoms: some British tribes allowed limited autonomy in exchange for loyalty

**Iceni Tribe:**
- Located in modern Norfolk/Suffolk (eastern England)
- King Prasutagus: ally of Rome, allowed to retain throne
- Wealthy tribe, agricultural

---

## Causes of the Revolt

**Death of Prasutagus (c. 60 CE):**
His will left kingdom to:
- Roman Emperor (half)
- His two daughters (half)

**Roman Response:**
Romans ignored the will entirely:
- Annexed Iceni kingdom
- Seized lands of Iceni nobles
- Demanded repayment of Roman loans
- Confiscated Iceni property

**Outrage:**
- **Boudica flogged publicly**
- **Her daughters raped by Roman soldiers/slaves**
- Iceni nobles dispossessed

This brutal treatment ignited revolt.

## The Rebellion (60-61 CE)

### Boudica's Army

- United Iceni with neighboring Trinovantes and other tribes
- Army estimates: 100,000+ (Roman sources, likely exaggerated)
- Warriors, chariots, families
- Romans vulnerable: Governor Suetonius Paulinus was campaigning in distant Wales (Anglesey)

### Destruction of Roman Cities

**Camulodunum (Colchester):**
- Roman colony, former Trinovantes capital
- Temple of Claudius: hated symbol of Roman rule
- City undefended (no walls)
- **Sacked and burned**; survivors killed
- Relief force (9th Legion) ambushed, destroyed

**Londinium (London):**
- Prosperous trading town
- Suetonius arrived but deemed it indefensible
- **Evacuated and burned**; those who stayed were massacred
- Burned layer found in archaeological excavations

**Verulamium (St Albans):**
- Important town
- **Sacked and burned**

**Death Toll:**
Roman historians: **70,000-80,000 killed**
- Romans, Roman allies, Britons who collaborated
- No prisoners taken; brutal revenge

## The Final Battle (61 CE)

**Location:** Unknown (possibly West Midlands area)

**Suetonius's Strategy:**
- 10,000 Roman legionaries
- Chose narrow battlefield, forest behind (protecting rear)
- Disciplined formation

**Battle:**
- Britons attacked in mass; Roman formation held
- Roman counterattack; Britons couldn't retreat (wagons full of families blocked escape)
- **Massacre**: Romans killed warriors and families alike
- **Roman account**: 80,000 Britons killed; 400 Romans

**Boudica's Death:**
Sources unclear:
- Took poison (Tacitus)
- Died of illness (Cassius Dio)
- Never captured; burial site unknown

## Sources and Reliability

**Roman Sources Only:**
- **Tacitus** (*Annals*, *Agricola*): Most detailed, father-in-law served in Britain
- **Cassius Dio** (*Roman History*): Wrote 150 years later, more dramatic

**Bias:**
Both are Roman writers, possibly exaggerated British numbers, portrayed Romans heroically.

**Boudica's Description (Dio):**
> "Very tall, the glance of her eye most fierce, her voice harsh. A great mass of tawny hair fell to her hips."

Wore gold torque, multicolored tunic, thick cloak.

## Legacy

**Roman Britain:**
- Revolt suppressed but shocked Rome
- Subsequent governors pursued more conciliatory policies
- Britain remained Roman for 350+ more years

**British Symbol:**

- Boudica = "Victory" in Celtic
- Statue at Westminster Bridge, London (1902)
- Symbol of British resistance, freedom

**Feminist Icon:**
- Female warrior queen
- Defended family honor
- Led men in battle

**Popular Culture:**
- Numerous novels, films, TV shows
- Often depicted with red hair, chariot, spear

## Famous Quotes (Attributed by Roman historians)

> "It is not as a woman descended from noble ancestry, but as one of the people that I am avenging lost freedom, my scourged body, the outraged chastity of my daughters." (Tacitus)

> "Nothing is safe from Roman pride and arrogance. They will deface the sacred and will deflower our virgins. Win the battle or perish—that is what I, a woman, will do."
