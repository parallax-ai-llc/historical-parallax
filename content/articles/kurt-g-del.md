## Summary

Kurt Gödel was an Austrian-American logician, mathematician, and philosopher who published the incompleteness theorems in 1931, which are among the most important results in mathematical logic. He proved that any consistent formal system capable of expressing basic arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proven within the system. His work fundamentally changed the philosophy of mathematics. Gödel was a close friend of Albert Einstein at Princeton.
