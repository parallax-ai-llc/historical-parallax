## Summary

Rainer Weiss is a German-born American physicist who shared the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics for decisive contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves. He conceived and designed the laser interferometric technique used in LIGO to detect gravitational waves. His pioneering work on cosmic microwave background measurements also contributed to precision cosmology. The detection of gravitational waves in 2015 confirmed Einstein's century-old prediction.
