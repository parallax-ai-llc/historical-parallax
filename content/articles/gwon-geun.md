## Summary

Gwon Geun (權近, 1352–1409), also romanized as Kwŏn Kŭn, was a pivotal Korean Neo-Confucian scholar who shaped the ideological foundations of the Joseon Dynasty. A student of the renowned scholar Yi Saek and member of the influential Andong Kwon clan, he passed civil service examinations at age fourteen and studied in Yuan China for six years.[^1] Despite initially supporting Goryeo loyalists and being exiled in 1389, he later aligned with Yi Seong-gye's new dynasty, becoming one of its principal intellectual architects. His most influential work, the *Iphak doseol* (Diagrammatic Treatise for Entering upon Learning), systematically introduced Zhu Xi's Neo-Confucianism to Korea and established philosophical frameworks that governed Korean thought for centuries.[^2]

## Early Life and Background

Gwon Geun was born in 1352 into the prestigious Andong Kwon clan, which held significant influence at the Goryeo court.[^3] The clan's founder, Kim Haeng, was originally royalty of the Silla Gyeongju Kim clan who participated in the Battle of Gochang and helped King Taejo establish the Kingdom of Goryeo in 918. The king bestowed upon Kim Haeng the new surname Kwon, recognizing his ability to judge situations correctly and achieve purposes flexibly.[^4]

From an early age, Gwon Geun demonstrated exceptional intellectual ability. He became a student of Yi Saek, one of the most prominent Neo-Confucian scholars of the late Goryeo period.[^5] At the remarkably young age of fourteen, he passed the first level of the civil service examinations, a feat that marked him as a prodigy among his contemporaries.[^6] This early success set the stage for his subsequent scholarly achievements and political career.

Seeking to deepen his understanding of Confucian learning, Gwon Geun traveled to Yuan China, where he spent six years immersing himself in advanced studies. During this period, he successfully passed the second and third levels of the Chinese civil service examinations, an extraordinary accomplishment for a Korean scholar studying abroad.[^7] This experience in Yuan China exposed him to the latest developments in Neo-Confucian thought, particularly the interpretations of Zhu Xi that were gaining prominence throughout East Asia. The education he received would prove instrumental in shaping his later contributions to Korean intellectual life.

Upon his return to Korea, Gwon Geun brought with him a sophisticated understanding of Neo-Confucian philosophy that few of his contemporaries possessed. His background combined aristocratic lineage, exceptional scholarly credentials, and international educational experience, positioning him uniquely to influence the dramatic political and ideological transformations that would soon unfold in Korea.

## Rise to Power

After returning from Yuan China, Gwon Geun became associated with the loyalist faction that supported the continuity of the Goryeo Dynasty.[^8] This alliance reflected his commitment to traditional legitimacy and his connection to his teacher Yi Saek, who remained steadfastly loyal to Goryeo. In 1389, Gwon Geun's political convictions led to severe consequences: he was exiled for defending Yi Sung-in (1349–1392), a Goryeo loyalist minister.[^9] While in exile, he even participated in efforts to prevent the rise of Yi Seong-gye by alerting the Ming Dynasty to the political machinations occurring in Korea.[^10]

Paradoxically, this period of political isolation became one of Gwon Geun's most productive scholarly phases. In 1390, while still in exile, students sought him out with philosophical questions. In response, he created the *Iphak doseol* (Diagrammatic Treatise for Entering upon Learning), which would become his most influential work.[^11] This treatise consisted of approximately forty diagrams with explanations designed to help beginners grasp the fundamentals of Neo-Confucian philosophy, particularly concepts of human nature and principle learning.[^12]

The political landscape shifted dramatically in 1392 when Yi Seong-gye overthrew the Goryeo Dynasty and established Joseon. Despite his earlier opposition, Gwon Geun made a calculated decision to support the new regime. This transition was not merely opportunistic; he helped General Yi Seong-gye found the new dynasty and became one of the architects of the Neo-Confucian ideology that provided both justification for the dynastic change and an ideological framework for the Joseon literati.[^13]

The First Strife of Princes in 1398 further consolidated Gwon Geun's position. When Yi Bang-won (later King Taejong) raided the palace and killed Jeong Do-jeon along with many prominent officials, Gwon Geun's political acumen saved him.[^14] Unlike his colleague Jung Mong-ju, who died defending Goryeo loyalism, and Jeong Do-jeon, who was eliminated in the succession struggle, Gwon Geun aligned himself with Yi Bang-won's faction.[^15] His excellent diplomatic abilities proved crucial in navigating these treacherous political waters.

From 1398 until his death in 1409, Gwon Geun became the most important scholar in the government, wielding unprecedented intellectual and political influence.[^16] His survival and ascendancy demonstrated not only his scholarly brilliance but also his remarkable political adaptability.

## Major Achievements

Gwon Geun's most enduring achievement was establishing Neo-Confucianism as the dominant ideology of the Joseon Dynasty. He introduced Zhu Xi's interpretations to the Korean audience, and his writings served as the foundation for future generations of Korean scholars.[^17] His systematic approach to Neo-Confucian philosophy laid the groundwork for debates that would animate Korean intellectual life for centuries.

The *Iphak doseol* (Diagrammatic Treatise for Entering upon Learning) stands as his magnum opus. This work comprehensively systematized all the major issues of early Neo-Confucian philosophy, including theories of *li* (principle) and *qi* (material force), the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions, and methods of self-cultivation.[^18] He paid particular attention to human nature and emphasized reverence (*gyeong*) as the key to self-cultivation.[^19] Modern scholars recognize his methodology as "the first systematic approach to the 'Great Learning in Chapters and Sentences' in the intellectual history of the Joseon dynasty and a rare case in East Asia."[^20]

Gwon Geun's defense of Zhu Xi's "Supplementary Chapter" of the Great Learning demonstrated his sophisticated philosophical reasoning. He went beyond simple advocacy, formulating systematic counterarguments to criticisms of Zhu Xi's interpretation and validating the rationality of Zhu Xi's system.[^21] His work contributed to establishing the academic authority of the *Great Learning in Chapters and Sentences*, helping Joseon scholars accept it as the best text for studying the Great Learning as a single, complete system.[^22]

Beyond his philosophical treatises, Gwon Geun was a prolific writer across multiple genres. His works include:

- *Dongguk Ssaryak* (東國史略, Concise History of the Eastern State) – a historical work examining Korean history[^23]
- *Yegi Cheon'gyeonnok* (禮記淺見錄, Comments on the Book of Rites) – commentary on classical ritual texts[^24]
- *Gwonhaksaui Paljo* (勸學事宜八條, Eight Articles on Recommendations for Learning) – educational guidance[^25]
- *Ogyeong cheongyeonnok* (Superficial Reflections on the Five Classics) – commentaries on classical texts[^26]
- *Saseo ogyeong gugyeol* (Mnemonics for the Four Books and the Five Classics) – study aids for Confucian texts[^27]

His diplomatic skills proved equally valuable to the new dynasty. Gwon Geun survived perilous missions to Ming China when others perished, demonstrating not only courage but also the strategic intelligence required to navigate the complex relationship between Joseon and the Ming Empire.[^28] In one notable incident involving detained envoys, when the news of Queen Sindeok's death arrived in Ming, Jung Chong wore white mourning clothes while Gwon Geun wore red garments given by the Hongwu Emperor. The emperor executed Jung Chong for wearing white, along with two other envoys, but Gwon Geun alone survived and returned to Korea.[^29]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Gwon Geun's political career was marked by a controversial transformation from Goryeo loyalist to Joseon supporter, which has generated criticism across centuries. After being exiled in 1389 for defending Goryeo loyalist minister Yi Sung-in and even attempting to prevent Yi Seong-gye's rise by alerting the Ming Dynasty, his subsequent alignment with the new Joseon regime appeared to many as a betrayal of his principles.[^30]

His relationship with his contemporaries reveals the moral complexity of his position. Gwon Geun was both a pupil of Yi Saek and a colleague of Jung Mong-ju, figures who remained loyal to Goryeo until death.[^31] Yet Gwon Geun joined Yi Bang-won's faction and used his diplomatic abilities to undermine Jeong Do-jeon, who was killed in the First Strife of Princes in 1398.[^32] This political maneuvering, while ensuring his survival and influence, raised questions about loyalty and principle that have never been fully resolved.

The incident during the Ming diplomatic mission highlights the ethical ambiguities of his actions. While his colleagues died for their adherence to Korean mourning customs when Queen Sindeok died, Gwon Geun's willingness to wear the red garments provided by the Hongwu Emperor saved his life but invited accusations of cultural compromise.[^33] Critics have questioned whether his survival demonstrated pragmatic wisdom or unprincipled opportunism.

His contributions to anti-Buddhist texts present another area of controversy. Gwon Geun wrote the preface to Jeong Do-jeon's *Pulssi Chappyŏn* (An Array of Critiques of Buddhism) and contributed to other anti-Buddhist works, participating in the Neo-Confucian campaign to displace Buddhism from its position as Korea's state religion.[^34] However, his personal behavior contradicted his anti-Buddhist rhetoric. He did not shun Buddhism in his daily life and participated in Buddhist events as a high government official under royal order during the early Joseon period.[^35] This inconsistency between his public positions and private actions has led to accusations of hypocrisy.

The legitimacy question surrounding the Joseon Dynasty's founding also implicates Gwon Geun's legacy. As one of the intellectual architects providing Neo-Confucian justification for the overthrow of Goryeo, he helped construct an ideology that validated what some viewed as usurpation.[^36] In search of justification for its rule given the lack of royal bloodline, the new regime needed recognition from countries like China, and scholars like Gwon Geun provided the ideological framework to support these claims.[^37]

Despite his historical importance, modern Korean academia has given him relatively limited attention. One study notes that "despite the importance of Gwon Geun's Diagrammatic Treatises, there are only two research articles in Korean language," suggesting his controversial political legacy may have overshadowed his philosophical contributions.[^38]

## Personal Life

Details about Gwon Geun's personal and family life remain limited in historical records, which focus primarily on his scholarly and political activities. He was a member of the prestigious Andong Kwon clan, one of the most influential aristocratic families during the Goryeo period.[^39] This family connection provided him with social capital and educational opportunities from an early age.

His most significant personal relationship documented in historical sources was his teacher-student bond with Yi Saek, one of the foremost Neo-Confucian scholars of late Goryeo.[^40] This relationship shaped his intellectual formation and initially influenced his political allegiances. The subsequent tension between his loyalty to his teacher's Goryeo loyalism and his own pragmatic accommodation with the Joseon Dynasty suggests the personal conflicts he must have experienced during Korea's dynastic transition.

His collegiality with Jung Mong-ju, another prominent scholar who remained loyal to Goryeo until his assassination in 1392, further illustrates the personal dimensions of the political upheavals Gwon Geun navigated.[^41] That he survived while his colleagues and associates perished speaks to both his political acumen and the personal choices he made to align with the ascendant powers.

The historical record suggests Gwon Geun possessed exceptional intellectual abilities combined with remarkable diplomatic skills. His capacity to survive a dangerous mission to Ming China when other envoys were executed demonstrates not only intelligence but also the personal charisma and strategic thinking required to navigate treacherous situations.[^42] His alignment with Yi Bang-won, who would become King Taejong, indicates his ability to identify and cultivate relationships with emerging power centers.[^43]

His teaching activities, particularly during his exile when students sought him out for philosophical instruction, reveal a dedication to education that transcended his immediate political circumstances.[^44] The creation of the *Iphak doseol* in response to students' questions demonstrates a personality committed to making complex philosophical ideas accessible to learners, suggesting a generous and pedagogical temperament beneath his political calculations.

## Legacy

Gwon Geun's legacy as one of the founding intellectual architects of the Joseon Dynasty remains his most significant historical contribution. He lived and served during the dynastic change and became one of the principal creators of the Neo-Confucian ideology that provided both justification for the transition and the ideological framework for Joseon literati for over five centuries.[^45] His introduction of Zhu Xi's interpretations to the Korean audience established the foundation upon which future Korean scholars built their philosophical systems.[^46]

The *Iphak doseol* (Diagrammatic Treatise for Entering upon Learning) became a foundational text in Korean Neo-Confucianism, with its systematic treatment of *li*-*qi* theory, the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions, and self-cultivation practices establishing the terms of debate for generations of Korean philosophers.[^47] Issues he comprehensively systematized would later become major points of controversy in Korean Neo-Confucian thought, most notably in the famous Four-Seven Debate between Yi Hwang (Toegye) and Yi I (Yulgok) in the sixteenth century.[^48]

His emphasis on reverence (*gyeong*) as the key to self-cultivation became a central theme in Korean Neo-Confucianism, distinguishing the Korean tradition from its Chinese and Japanese counterparts.[^49] Modern scholars recognize that Gwon Geun "had the most sophisticated understanding of Neo-Confucian metaphysics" in the fourteenth century, particularly through his innovative use of diagrams to explain complex philosophical concepts.[^50]

His defense of Zhu Xi's "Supplementary Chapter" of the Great Learning established academic precedents that shaped Korean scholarly methodology. His systematic counterarguments to criticisms of Zhu Xi's interpretation and his efforts to validate the rationality of Zhu Xi's system contributed to establishing the *Great Learning in Chapters and Sentences* as authoritative for studying the text.[^51] This work helped Joseon scholars accept it as the best text for studying the Great Learning as a single, complete system.[^52]

Beyond philosophy, his historical work *Dongguk Ssaryak* (Concise History of the Eastern State) contributed to Korean historiography, while his commentaries on classical texts helped standardize scholarly approaches to Confucian literature in Korea.[^53] His anti-Buddhist writings, particularly his preface to Jeong Do-jeon's *Pulssi Chappyŏn*, participated in the ideological campaign that displaced Buddhism from its position as state religion, fundamentally transforming Korean religious and cultural life.[^54]

His diplomatic successes established models for Joseon-Ming relations that would persist throughout the dynasty. His survival of the perilous mission to the Ming court demonstrated the importance of cultural adaptability and strategic intelligence in international relations.[^55]

The institutional frameworks he helped establish—the civil service examination system based on Neo-Confucian texts, the scholarly emphasis on moral cultivation, and the integration of political authority with Confucian learning—shaped Korean society and governance for over five hundred years.[^56] His legacy thus extends far beyond his individual writings to encompass the entire ideological and institutional structure of the Joseon Dynasty.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholarship has increasingly recognized Gwon Geun's philosophical sophistication and historical significance. Recent academic research describes his methodology regarding the 'Supplementary Chapter' of the 'Great Learning' as "the first systematic approach to the 'Great Learning in Chapters and Sentences' in the intellectual history of the Joseon dynasty and a rare case in East Asia."[^57] This evaluation positions him not merely as a transmitter of Chinese Neo-Confucianism but as an original thinker who made unique contributions to East Asian philosophy.

Scholars defending his historical and philosophical significance have examined the logical structure of his arguments, demonstrating their intellectual rigor.[^58] His work contributed substantially to establishing the academic authority of Neo-Confucian texts in Korea, helping subsequent generations of Joseon scholars accept these interpretations as foundational.[^59] Western scholars, including Michael C. Kalton, have studied his writings and recognized their role in early Yi Dynasty Neo-Confucianism.[^60]

His comprehensive systematization of early Neo-Confucian philosophy—incorporating *li*-*qi* theory, the Four Beginnings and Seven Emotions, and self-cultivation practices—demonstrated a mastery of complex metaphysical concepts that few of his contemporaries achieved.[^61] His emphasis on reverence as central to self-cultivation established a distinctively Korean approach to Neo-Confucian practice.[^62]

Admirers note his remarkable adaptability and political intelligence. His survival during Korea's most turbulent political transition, his successful diplomatic missions to Ming China, and his ability to maintain scholarly productivity even during exile demonstrate exceptional capabilities.[^63] His alignment with the ultimately successful Joseon faction can be viewed not as opportunism but as recognition of historical necessity and the importance of establishing a stable ideological foundation for the new dynasty.[^64]

His pedagogical contributions, particularly the *Iphak doseol* with its innovative use of diagrams to explain complex philosophical ideas, made Neo-Confucian learning accessible to broader audiences.[^65] This democratization of philosophical knowledge helped establish the scholarly culture that became a defining characteristic of Joseon society.

### Negative Views

Critics have consistently questioned Gwon Geun's political integrity and moral consistency. His transformation from Goryeo loyalist—exiled in 1389 for defending loyalist minister Yi Sung-in and attempting to prevent Yi Seong-gye's rise by alerting Ming China—to a principal architect of Joseon legitimacy appears to many as fundamental betrayal.[^66] Unlike his teacher Yi Saek and his colleague Jung Mong-ju, who remained loyal to Goryeo until death, Gwon Geun's pragmatic accommodation with the new regime raises questions about the relationship between Confucian principles and political expediency.[^67]

His role in the First Strife of Princes of 1398 attracts particular criticism. While his colleagues Jung Mong-ju and Jeong Do-jeon died for their principles, Gwon Geun joined Yi Bang-won's faction and used his diplomatic abilities against Jeong Do-jeon, contributing to the violent power struggle that claimed many lives.[^68] Critics argue this demonstrates a willingness to prioritize personal survival and advancement over loyalty and principle.

The incident during the Ming diplomatic mission, where Gwon Geun wore red garments provided by the Hongwu Emperor while his colleague Jung Chong wore traditional white mourning clothes (leading to Jung Chong's execution), symbolizes for critics his willingness to compromise Korean cultural integrity for personal benefit.[^69] That he alone survived when other envoys were executed raises questions about what accommodations he made to secure the emperor's favor.

His intellectual inconsistency regarding Buddhism presents another area of criticism. While he contributed prominently to anti-Buddhist texts, including writing the preface to Jeong Do-jeon's *Pulssi Chappyŏn*, his personal behavior contradicted this public stance—he did not shun Buddhism in daily life and participated in Buddhist events as a government official.[^70] This hypocrisy between rhetoric and practice undermines his credibility as a principled Confucian scholar.

Some historians view his role in providing Neo-Confucian justification for Joseon's founding as intellectually dishonest rationalization of political usurpation rather than genuine philosophical conviction.[^71] The new regime lacked royal bloodline legitimacy and required ideological justification, which scholars like Gwon Geun conveniently provided.[^72]

The relative neglect of his work in modern Korean scholarship—with only two research articles in Korean despite the importance of his Diagrammatic Treatises—suggests that his controversial political legacy has overshadowed his philosophical contributions.[^73] This scholarly marginalization may reflect continuing discomfort with the moral compromises he made during Korea's dynastic transition.
