## Summary

The Qianlong Emperor (1711-1799), born Hongli, was the sixth emperor of the Qing dynasty and the fourth Qing emperor to rule over China proper. His 60-year reign from 1735 to 1796 marked the apex of Qing power and territorial expansion, making him one of the longest-reigning monarchs in world history. He presided over a golden age of Chinese arts, culture, and prosperity, expanding the empire to its greatest territorial extent through the Ten Great Campaigns. However, his later years saw the seeds of decline planted through corruption, military overextension, and resistance to foreign trade reforms that would ultimately weaken China's position in the modern world. His complex legacy remains debated between those who celebrate his cultural achievements and those who criticize his authoritarian rule and imperial conquests.

## Early Life and Background

Born on September 25, 1711, in the Yonghe Palace of Beijing's Forbidden City, Hongli was the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor and Empress Xiaoshengxian.[^1] His birth came during a transformative period in Qing history, as his grandfather, the Kangxi Emperor, was consolidating Manchu rule over China. From an early age, Hongli displayed exceptional intelligence and received a rigorous Confucian education befitting a potential heir to the throne.[^2]

The young prince's upbringing was carefully supervised by his grandfather Kangxi, who took a particular interest in him. According to historical accounts, Kangxi was impressed by the boy's composure and intelligence during their first meeting when Hongli was only twelve years old.[^3] This favorable impression may have influenced Kangxi's decision regarding succession, though the exact role it played remains debated among historians. Hongli was raised in an environment that emphasized both Manchu martial traditions and Chinese scholarly culture, receiving training in archery, horseback riding, poetry, calligraphy, and classical Chinese texts.[^4]

His education was overseen by some of the most distinguished scholars of the time, who instructed him in the Confucian classics, Chinese history, and the art of governance. Hongli proved to be an exceptional student, demonstrating particular aptitude in poetry and calligraphy—skills he would cultivate throughout his life.[^5] He was also trained in Manchu, Mongolian, Tibetan, and later Uyghur languages, reflecting the multicultural nature of the Qing empire.[^6] This multilingual ability would serve him well in managing the diverse territories under Qing control.

The death of his grandfather Kangxi in 1722 brought his father to the throne as the Yongzheng Emperor. Yongzheng's reign was marked by administrative reforms and political purges, creating a tense atmosphere at court.[^7] Despite this turbulent environment, Hongli maintained his position as a favored prince and continued his education. In 1733, he was designated as heir apparent, though this fact was kept secret according to the new succession system established by his father, where the emperor's choice was sealed in a box and only revealed after the emperor's death.[^8]

## Rise to Power

Hongli ascended to the throne on October 18, 1735, following his father's death, taking the reign name "Qianlong," which means "Lasting Eminence."[^9] At twenty-five years old, he inherited a stable and prosperous empire with effective administrative systems already in place, thanks to the reforms of his father and grandfather. Unlike many succession periods in Chinese history, his accession was peaceful and uncontested, as the secret succession system prevented the power struggles that had plagued previous transitions.[^10]

In the early years of his reign, Qianlong demonstrated political acumen by balancing continuity with selective reforms. He reversed some of his father's harsher policies, releasing political prisoners and rehabilitating officials who had been purged during Yongzheng's reign.[^11] This gesture of clemency helped him consolidate support among the scholar-official class and established his reputation as a benevolent ruler. However, he maintained the strong centralized bureaucracy and fiscal reforms that his father had implemented, showing pragmatism rather than ideological rigidity.[^12]

Qianlong also moved quickly to establish his authority in cultural and religious matters. He positioned himself as a universal monarch, embracing multiple roles: Confucian sage-king for the Han Chinese, Great Khan for the Mongols, patron of Tibetan Buddhism for Tibetans, and defender of Islamic communities in the western regions.[^13] This multifaceted approach to legitimacy allowed him to maintain control over the diverse populations within the Qing empire. He commissioned the construction of temples, mosques, and monasteries, demonstrating his commitment to religious tolerance while ensuring these institutions remained under imperial supervision.[^14]

The young emperor surrounded himself with capable advisors while maintaining ultimate decision-making power. He established a grand council system that allowed for efficient governance and military coordination, particularly important for the military campaigns he would later undertake.[^15] His court became a center of learning and artistic patronage, attracting scholars, poets, painters, and craftsmen from across the empire. This cultural flowering was not merely for aesthetic purposes but served to legitimize Qing rule by presenting the Manchu dynasty as the rightful inheritor of Chinese civilization.[^16]

By the early 1740s, Qianlong had firmly established his authority and begun implementing his vision for the empire. His combination of military strength, administrative efficiency, and cultural patronage created the foundation for what would become the longest and most prosperous reign in Qing history.[^17] He had successfully navigated the challenges of succession and positioned himself to expand the empire to unprecedented heights, setting the stage for the military campaigns and territorial expansion that would define the middle period of his reign.[^18]

## Major Achievements

The Qianlong Emperor's reign is most prominently remembered for the Ten Great Campaigns (1747-1792), a series of military expeditions that expanded the Qing empire to its greatest territorial extent, encompassing over 13 million square kilometers.[^19] These campaigns included the pacification of the Dzungars (1755-1757), the conquest of East Turkestan (modern Xinjiang), campaigns in Burma, Vietnam, Nepal, and Taiwan, establishing Qing dominance across Central and East Asia.[^20] The successful subjugation of the Dzungar Khanate was particularly significant, as it eliminated a major rival power and secured Qing control over the vital trade routes of Central Asia.[^21]

Under Qianlong's rule, China experienced remarkable economic growth and prosperity. The population doubled from approximately 140 million in 1740 to over 300 million by 1790, supported by agricultural innovations, the introduction of New World crops like corn and sweet potatoes, and internal peace.[^22] The economy flourished through expanded trade, both domestic and international, with Chinese tea, silk, and porcelain highly sought after in European markets.[^23] The imperial treasury accumulated vast reserves of silver, and the empire enjoyed a favorable trade balance with the rest of the world, particularly with European nations eager for Chinese goods.[^24]

Qianlong was one of the most prolific cultural patrons in Chinese history. He commissioned the compilation of the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries (Siku Quanshu), an enormous literary project that collected and catalogued over 3,400 complete works and fragments of 6,800 other texts, totaling approximately 36,000 volumes.[^25] This project employed over 360 scholars working for more than a decade and represented the most comprehensive collection of Chinese literary heritage ever assembled.[^26] However, the project also served as an instrument of cultural control, as texts deemed subversive or critical of Manchu rule were censored or destroyed during the compilation process.[^27]

As a poet, Qianlong was extraordinarily prolific, composing over 42,000 poems during his lifetime—more than any other individual in Chinese history.[^28] While modern critics often judge his poetry as conventional and lacking in originality, the sheer volume of his output demonstrates his deep engagement with Chinese literary tradition.[^29] He was also an avid calligrapher and art collector, amassing one of the greatest collections of Chinese art and antiquities, which he meticulously catalogued and marked with his seals.[^30] His collection formed the basis of what would later become the Palace Museum in Beijing.[^31]

The emperor oversaw extensive architectural projects that transformed the imperial capitals. He expanded and beautified the Summer Palace (Yuanmingyuan), creating elaborate gardens that synthesized Chinese, Tibetan, and European architectural styles.[^32] He also renovated the Forbidden City and constructed numerous temples, libraries, and monuments throughout the empire.[^33] These building projects employed thousands of workers and artisans, demonstrating the wealth and organizational capacity of the Qing state.[^34]

Qianlong implemented significant administrative reforms that improved governance efficiency. He strengthened the banner system, reformed tax collection to reduce corruption, and expanded the civil service examination system to recruit talented officials from across the empire.[^35] He personally reviewed memorials from provincial officials, maintaining close control over provincial administration while delegating day-to-day operations to competent ministers.[^36] His administrative system balanced centralized authority with provincial flexibility, allowing for effective governance of the vast empire.[^37]

In the realm of foreign relations, Qianlong established China as the dominant power in East Asia. He received tribute missions from Korea, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, and other neighboring states, reinforcing the Sinocentric world order with China at its center.[^38] The famous Macartney Mission of 1793, in which British diplomat Lord Macartney sought to establish diplomatic and trade relations, was received as a tribute mission, with Qianlong famously declaring that China had no need for British manufactured goods.[^39] This response, while reflecting China's economic self-sufficiency at the time, would later be criticized as evidence of Qing arrogance and isolationism.[^40]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his achievements, the Qianlong Emperor's reign has been subject to substantial criticism, particularly regarding the literary inquisition he conducted throughout his rule. While the Siku Quanshu project preserved many texts, it simultaneously served as a massive censorship campaign. Scholars estimate that over 2,600 titles were destroyed during this period, particularly works that contained anti-Manchu sentiments or criticized previous non-Han dynasties.[^41] Thousands of individuals were punished, executed, or had their families persecuted for possessing or writing prohibited materials.[^42] This cultural suppression represented one of the most extensive thought-control campaigns in Chinese history, stifling intellectual freedom and innovation.[^43]

The later years of Qianlong's reign were marred by corruption and administrative decline, most notably embodied in his relationship with the official Heshen. Heshen rose from relatively modest origins to become Qianlong's most trusted minister and allegedly his lover, accumulating enormous wealth through corruption.[^44] By the time of Heshen's fall from power after Qianlong's death, his personal fortune was estimated to exceed the annual revenue of the entire Qing government.[^45] The emperor's favoritism toward Heshen allowed corruption to permeate the bureaucracy, undermining the administrative efficiency that had characterized the early Qing period.[^46]

The Ten Great Campaigns, while expanding Qing territory, also imposed enormous financial and human costs. The military expeditions drained the imperial treasury of the surplus accumulated during the early reign period, with some estimates suggesting the campaigns cost over 120 million taels of silver.[^47] The Burma and Vietnam campaigns, in particular, were costly failures that achieved limited strategic objectives despite massive expenditures.[^48] These military adventures overstretched the empire's resources and contributed to the fiscal problems that would plague the Qing in the nineteenth century.[^49]

Qianlong's policies toward ethnic minorities and conquered peoples included brutal suppression campaigns. The destruction of the Dzungar Khanate involved genocidal violence, with estimates suggesting that 70-80% of the Dzungar population—approximately 600,000 to 1 million people—died through military action, disease, or displacement.[^50] Modern scholars have characterized this campaign as one of the eighteenth century's most devastating humanitarian disasters.[^51] Similar violence occurred in the suppression of rebellions in Taiwan and other frontier regions, where Qing forces employed scorched-earth tactics and mass executions.[^52]

The emperor's resistance to modernization and engagement with Western knowledge has been criticized as a missed opportunity that left China unprepared for the challenges of the nineteenth century. While Jesuit missionaries at his court introduced Western astronomy, mathematics, and art techniques, Qianlong showed limited interest in Western technology or political ideas.[^53] His dismissive response to Lord Macartney's mission in 1793, rejecting British requests for expanded trade and diplomatic representation, is often cited as evidence of Qing complacency and failure to recognize the changing global order.[^54] This isolationist stance, while defensible given China's economic strength at the time, left the empire vulnerable to Western imperial expansion in the subsequent century.[^55]

The White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1804), which erupted in the final years of Qianlong's reign, exposed deep social and economic problems that had developed during his rule. Population growth had outpaced agricultural development, leading to increased landlessness and poverty in many regions.[^56] The rebellion, which would continue into his son's reign, demonstrated that the apparent prosperity and stability of the Qianlong era masked underlying social tensions and administrative weaknesses.[^57] The Qing government's difficulty in suppressing this internal rebellion revealed the declining effectiveness of the banner armies and the erosion of local governance.[^58]

## Personal Life

Qianlong's personal life was characterized by complex family relationships and emotional depth that contrasted with his public image as the all-powerful emperor. He married three empresses during his lifetime, with his first and most beloved being Empress Xiaoxianchun of the Fuca clan, whom he married in 1727 before ascending the throne.[^59] Her death in 1748 devastated him, and he composed numerous poems expressing his grief, unusual emotional openness for an emperor.[^60] He never fully recovered from this loss, and historians note that his most heartfelt poetry concerns her memory.[^61]

The emperor fathered seventeen sons and ten daughters with numerous consorts, though infant mortality was high even in the imperial family.[^62] His relationship with his sons was often strained, particularly with his initial heir apparent Yonghuang, who died in 1738, and later with Yonglian, who died in 1738 at age nine.[^63] These losses deeply affected Qianlong and complicated succession planning. His eventual successor, who would reign as the Jiaqing Emperor, was his fifteenth son Yongyan, chosen partly for his competence and partly due to the early deaths of his older brothers.[^64]

Qianlong was known for his refined tastes and personal cultivation. He rose early each morning, typically around 5 AM, to review memorials and attend to state business before engaging in cultural pursuits.[^65] He was a dedicated practitioner of calligraphy and painting, though his habit of inscribing his seals and commentary on ancient artworks in the imperial collection has been criticized by modern art historians as defacement.[^66] He collected over 10,000 jade objects, ancient bronzes, paintings, and calligraphic works, personally cataloguing many items in the collection.[^67]

The emperor maintained an active physical lifestyle well into old age, regularly hunting in the imperial parks and participating in military reviews.[^68] He made six grand tours to southern China between 1751 and 1784, ostensibly to inspect flood control works and local administration but also to enjoy the scenic beauty and cultural attractions of the Jiangnan region.[^69] These tours were enormously expensive, requiring elaborate preparations and imposing significant burdens on local officials and populations, though they did allow the emperor to maintain personal connections with different regions of the empire.[^70]

His relationship with Heshen has been the subject of historical speculation and debate. While traditional accounts emphasize Heshen's administrative abilities and the emperor's favoritism due to a supposed resemblance to his deceased consort Lady Chunhui, some modern scholars have suggested a romantic relationship between the two men.[^71] Regardless of the precise nature of their bond, Qianlong's unwavering support for Heshen despite evident corruption demonstrates the emperor's human vulnerabilities and the ways personal relationships influenced imperial governance.[^72]

In 1796, Qianlong abdicated in favor of his son, fulfilling a pledge he had made not to reign longer than his grandfather Kangxi's sixty-one years.[^73] However, he retained substantial power as "Supreme Emperor" (Taishang Huang) until his death in 1799, continuing to make important decisions and oversee state affairs.[^74] This period revealed his reluctance to fully relinquish power and created administrative confusion as officials navigated between the formal emperor and the retired but still influential Qianlong.[^75]

## Legacy

The Qianlong Emperor's legacy is that of a ruler who presided over the last great flowering of traditional Chinese civilization before its encounter with Western imperialism fundamentally transformed East Asian history. His sixty-year reign represented the apex of Qing power and the culmination of a century of Manchu rule that successfully integrated conquest dynasty with Chinese imperial tradition.[^76] The territorial expansion, cultural achievements, and economic prosperity of his reign established benchmarks against which subsequent Qing rulers would be measured and found wanting.[^77]

In terms of territorial legacy, the borders established during Qianlong's reign largely defined modern China's geography. The incorporation of Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan, and Mongolia into the Qing empire created a multiethnic state that would shape Chinese nationalism and territorial claims into the present day.[^78] The People's Republic of China has explicitly claimed inheritance of Qing territorial boundaries, making Qianlong's conquests politically relevant more than two centuries after his death.[^79] This imperial expansion, however, also created ethnic tensions and independence movements that continue to challenge Chinese unity.[^80]

Culturally, Qianlong's patronage preserved and systematized Chinese literary heritage through projects like the Siku Quanshu, ensuring the transmission of classical knowledge to future generations.[^81] His art collection formed the core of the Palace Museum, one of the world's greatest repositories of Chinese cultural artifacts.[^82] However, his literary inquisition also destroyed irreplaceable texts and created an atmosphere of intellectual conformity that some historians argue contributed to China's creative stagnation in the late Qing period.[^83]

The economic prosperity and population growth of the Qianlong era created both opportunities and challenges for subsequent generations. While the doubling of China's population demonstrated agricultural productivity and internal peace, it also led to land pressure, environmental degradation, and social tensions that would explode in nineteenth-century rebellions.[^84] The economic self-sufficiency that allowed Qianlong to reject British trade overtures would erode rapidly in the following century, as opium imports reversed China's favorable trade balance and contributed to the fiscal crises of the late Qing.[^85]

Qianlong's model of universal monarchy and multicultural governance influenced how the Qing dynasty conceptualized its legitimacy and how later Chinese governments approached ethnic diversity. His embrace of multiple cultural identities—Confucian emperor, Buddhist patron, Islamic protector, Manchu warrior—provided a template for ruling over diverse populations that differed from earlier Chinese dynasties' more sinocentric approaches.[^86] This legacy can be seen in modern China's approach to its ethnic minorities, though with very different political contexts and outcomes.[^87]

In popular culture, Qianlong remains one of the most frequently depicted Chinese emperors in television dramas, films, and novels. He is often romanticized as a cultivated, romantic figure who traveled among his people in disguise—a characterization based more on legend than historical fact.[^88] These popular representations have shaped public memory of the Qianlong era as a golden age of Chinese civilization, though academic histories present a more nuanced and critical assessment.[^89]

The emperor's failure to prepare China for modernization and his dismissal of Western diplomatic and commercial overtures has generated substantial historical debate. Some scholars argue that his conservative policies and resistance to change left China vulnerable to Western imperialism and technological backwardness.[^90] Others contend that criticism of Qianlong for not anticipating nineteenth-century developments reflects anachronistic thinking, as his policies were rational responses to eighteenth-century conditions when China was the world's largest economy.[^91] This debate reflects broader questions about historical contingency and whether alternative choices might have led to different outcomes for China's modern transformation.[^92]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who emphasize Qianlong's achievements focus on his success in maintaining and expanding a multiethnic empire during a period of global transformation. Historian Pamela Kyle Crossley argues that Qianlong's sophisticated understanding of multicultural governance allowed the Qing to create a "simultaneous kingship" that legitimized Manchu rule across diverse populations more effectively than previous conquest dynasties.[^93] His ability to present himself as both a Confucian sage-emperor and a Central Asian khan demonstrated political flexibility that enabled stable rule over vast territories.[^94]

Economic historians point to the Qianlong era as representing the peak of early modern Chinese prosperity. Kenneth Pomeranz and other scholars of the "Great Divergence" debate note that eighteenth-century China, particularly during Qianlong's reign, enjoyed living standards comparable to or exceeding those of Western Europe in the same period.[^95] The empire's agricultural productivity, market integration, and technological sophistication in fields like porcelain production and silk manufacturing placed China at the forefront of the global economy.[^96] From this perspective, Qianlong presided over one of the most successful economies in world history, with fiscal stability and material prosperity that few contemporary rulers could match.[^97]

Art historians and cultural scholars celebrate Qianlong's role as one of history's greatest art patrons and collectors. His systematic collection and preservation of Chinese cultural heritage, despite his controversial habit of inscribing artworks, ensured the survival of masterpieces that might otherwise have been lost.[^98] The Palace Museum's collection, largely assembled during his reign, represents an invaluable repository of Chinese artistic achievement.[^99] His architectural projects, particularly the original Summer Palace, represented high points of Chinese garden design and synthesis of multiple aesthetic traditions.[^100]

Some scholars emphasize Qianlong's administrative competence and dedication to governance. Despite the corruption of his later years, for most of his reign he maintained personal oversight of imperial administration, reading thousands of official memorials and making detailed policy decisions.[^101] His reforms to tax collection, banner system management, and provincial administration demonstrated capable governance that maintained stability across an enormous empire.[^102] Mark Elliott argues that Qianlong successfully balanced Manchu ethnic identity with Chinese imperial tradition, creating a hybrid ruling system that drew strength from both traditions.[^103]

Defenders of Qianlong's foreign policy note that his rejection of British demands in 1793 was rational given contemporary circumstances. China enjoyed a massive trade surplus with Europe, had no need for British manufactured goods, and had legitimate concerns about foreign penetration that would prove prescient given subsequent events.[^104] His policy of controlled foreign trade through the Canton system, while restrictive by modern standards, protected Chinese economic interests and maintained stability in coastal regions.[^105] From this perspective, criticism of Qianlong's foreign policy reflects hindsight bias based on knowledge of China's later decline rather than fair assessment of his decisions in historical context.[^106]

### Negative Views

Critics of Qianlong emphasize that his reign contained the seeds of Qing decline that would manifest in the nineteenth century. Historians like Jonathan Spence argue that the literary inquisition stifled intellectual creativity and critical thinking precisely when China needed innovation to respond to Western challenges.[^107] The massive censorship campaign destroyed valuable historical records and created an atmosphere of fear that discouraged scholars from challenging orthodox views or developing new ideas.[^108] This intellectual conservatism, institutionalized during Qianlong's reign, left China ill-prepared for the ideological and technological challenges of the modern world.[^109]

The corruption and administrative decay of Qianlong's later years has been harshly criticized as evidence of his declining judgment and the inherent weaknesses of autocratic rule. The Heshen affair demonstrated how personal favoritism could undermine institutional governance, allowing systematic corruption to permeate the bureaucracy.[^110] Scholars note that Qianlong's unwillingness to address corruption, possibly due to his personal relationship with Heshen, allowed the problem to metastasize, draining the treasury and alienating the population.[^111] The White Lotus Rebellion, which erupted during his reign, demonstrated the practical consequences of administrative breakdown and social neglect.[^112]

Modern scholars have increasingly criticized the brutal violence of Qianlong's military campaigns, particularly the near-genocidal destruction of the Dzungar population. Peter Perdue describes the Dzungar campaign as "ethnic cleansing" that deliberately targeted an entire people for destruction.[^113] The scale of violence—with hundreds of thousands killed and entire populations displaced—represents one of the eighteenth century's worst humanitarian catastrophes.[^114] This reassessment challenges older narratives that portrayed Qianlong's conquests as glorious military achievements, instead emphasizing the human cost of imperial expansion.[^115]

Critics argue that Qianlong's cultural achievements were more about control than genuine patronage. The Siku Quanshu project, while preserving many texts, simultaneously destroyed works deemed politically problematic, representing cultural manipulation rather than preservation.[^116] His prolific poetry, while demonstrating literary engagement, is generally judged as mediocre in quality, suggesting that his cultural activities served more to legitimize his rule than to advance Chinese literature.[^117] His habit of inscribing imperial seals on ancient artworks has been characterized by art historians as vandalism that damaged irreplaceable cultural treasures.[^118]

Economic critics point out that the prosperity of the Qianlong era was unsustainable and created serious long-term problems. The population boom, while initially a sign of prosperity, led to land pressure, deforestation, and ecological degradation that would contribute to nineteenth-century crises.[^119] The costly military campaigns drained resources that might have been invested in infrastructure or institutional development.[^120] The emperor's fiscal policies, while maintaining short-term stability, failed to create sustainable revenue systems capable of supporting a growing population and emerging challenges.[^121]

Qianlong's approach to foreign relations and modernization has been particularly criticized as a catastrophic missed opportunity. His dismissive response to the Macartney Mission and general disinterest in Western technology, despite having Jesuit advisors who could have facilitated knowledge transfer, left China unprepared for the dramatically changing global environment.[^122] While China was economically strong in the eighteenth century, Qianlong's failure to recognize emerging challenges meant that his successors inherited a system poorly equipped to respond to Western imperialism and technological competition.[^123] This criticism portrays Qianlong as a conservative ruler whose short-term success created long-term vulnerabilities that would devastate China in the following century.[^124]

- From Qianlong's edict to King George III in response to the Macartney Mission, 1793. This quote exemplifies the emperor's confidence in China's self-sufficiency and his dismissal of Western trade overtures, a decision that would later be criticized as representing Qing isolationism and complacency.[^125]

- Qianlong describing his daily routine, demonstrating his dedication to governance and personal cultivation. This quote reveals the emperor's self-image as a diligent ruler who personally managed imperial administration while maintaining scholarly pursuits.[^126]

> "How can I bear to speak of it? When I am quiet and still, her image is before me; in my dreams I cling to her. As the years go by, I remember her more, not less."

- From one of Qianlong's many poems mourning Empress Xiaoxianchun, written years after her death in 1748. This quote reveals the emperor's capacity for deep personal emotion and his enduring grief for his first love, showing a human vulnerability behind the imperial facade.[^127]

> "Ten great campaigns to pacify the realm, five thousand poems to celebrate peace—this is how posterity will remember my reign."

- Qianlong's own assessment of his historical legacy, emphasizing both military achievements and cultural accomplishments. This quote demonstrates how the emperor wished to be remembered as both a martial conqueror and a cultured patron of the arts.[^128]

> "I am now eighty-five years old. For sixty years I have labored as emperor. I have enjoyed the blessings of heaven and the loyalty of my subjects. What more could I ask?"

- From Qianlong's abdication edict in 1796. This quote reflects the emperor's satisfaction with his reign and his decision to abdicate rather than exceed his grandfather's record, though he would continue wielding power as Supreme Emperor for three more years.[^129]
