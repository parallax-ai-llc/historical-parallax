## Summary

Ephraim McDowell performed the first successful ovariotomy (ovarian tumor removal) in 1809 on Jane Todd Crawford without anesthesia, in a log cabin in Danville, Kentucky. Crawford survived 31 more years. This surgery, considered impossible at the time, established abdominal surgery as a viable field and earned McDowell recognition as the father of ovariotomy.
