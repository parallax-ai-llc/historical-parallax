## Summary

Nettie Stevens was an American geneticist who discovered the chromosomal basis of sex determination. In 1905, she demonstrated that sex is determined by specific chromosomes (X and Y), a fundamental discovery in genetics. Despite her groundbreaking work, her male colleague Edmund Beecher Wilson often received more credit. She died of breast cancer at age 50 before her contributions were fully recognized.
