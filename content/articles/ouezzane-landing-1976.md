## Summary

On the night of September 19, 1976—the same night as the famous **Tehran UFO Incident**—a massive wave of UFO sightings occurred across Morocco. The most spectacular report came from near Ouezzane, where witnesses described a silvery, luminous object landing on a farm.

The King of Morocco, **Hassan II**, was so concerned he personally requested updates. The U.S. Embassy in Rabat sent a diplomatic cable (later released by WikiLeaks) confirming that the Moroccan Royal Gendarmerie was investigating multiple sightings of objects flying parallel to the coast.[^1]

## The "Night of the UFOs"

### Global Context
This event coincided with the Tehran incident (where F-4 jets were jammed). It suggests a global wave of activity that night.
*   **The Sightings:** From Agadir to Casablanca, police and pilots reported silver discs and luminous tubes.
*   **The Landing:** Near Ouezzane, a farm family reported an object landing, emitting a strange hum, and taking off again.

### Official Involvement
Colonel Housni Benslimane (Commander of the Gendarmerie) met with the U.S. Defense Attaché. They discussed the similarity to reports from Iran and Portugal. The U.S. State Department cable titled **"Unidentified Flying Objects"** remains a key document proving high-level government interest.
