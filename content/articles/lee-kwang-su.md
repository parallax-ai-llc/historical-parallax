## Summary

Yi Kwangsu (이광수; February 1, 1892 – October 25, 1950), also known by his pen names Chunwon and Goju, was Korea's most influential modern novelist and one of its most controversial historical figures.[^1] He authored *Mujeong* (*The Heartless*, 1917), widely recognized as the first modern Korean novel, and pioneered modern vernacular Korean literature.[^2] Initially a passionate independence activist who drafted the February 8 Declaration of Independence in 1919, Yi later became a collaborator with Imperial Japan from the late 1930s onward, a betrayal that permanently tarnished his legacy.[^3] His life trajectory—from nationalist hero to condemned traitor—embodies the moral complexities and painful compromises of Korea's colonial period.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Yi Kwangsu was born Yi Bogyeong on February 1, 1892, in Chŏngju, North Pyongan Province, Joseon, into a poor yangban (upper class) family.[^5] He enrolled at a seodang (traditional school) in 1899, receiving a classical Confucian education during the twilight years of the Korean monarchy.[^6] Tragedy struck in 1902 when both his parents died of cholera, leaving him orphaned at age ten.[^7] He was subsequently taken in by Pak Ch'anmyŏng, a local leader of the Tonghak (Eastern Learning) religious movement, which profoundly influenced his early worldview.[^8]

In August 1905, amid the turbulent period of growing Japanese influence over Korea, Yi received a scholarship from the controversial organization Iljinhoe to study abroad in Japan.[^9] He enrolled in Daise Middle School in March 1906, then transferred to Meiji Gakuin, a Christian mission school in Tokyo, in 1907, graduating in March 1910—the same year Japan formally annexed Korea.[^10] During his time at Meiji Gakuin, the young Yi grew increasingly frustrated with both the Japanese and American faculty and struggled to maintain his earlier Christian piety.[^11] In late 1909, while still a student, he published his first literary work, "Ai ka" (*Is It Love*), a Japanese-language short story in the school newsletter *Shirogane gakuhō*.[^12] This work has been considered one of the pioneers of queer literature in Korea.[^13]

After graduation, Yi returned to Korea and became a teacher at the Osan School in Chŏngju, his hometown, eventually serving as its headmaster in 1911.[^14] During this period, he came under the profound influence of Ahn Chang-ho (An Ch'angho), a respected independence activist from the same region whom Yi would consider his adopted father and mentor until Ahn's death in 1937.[^15] In 1916, Yi returned to Japan to study at Waseda University but dropped out in his third year.[^16]

## Rise to Prominence

Yi Kwangsu's rise to literary and political prominence began with two parallel developments: his groundbreaking contributions to Korean literature and his passionate engagement with the independence movement. In November 1916, while studying in Japan, Yi published "What Is Literature" in the *Maeil sinbo* newspaper, considered the first modern work of literary theory in Korea.[^17] This essay articulated his vision that "the spirit of the nation that has been transmitted from the time of our ancestors…will be the center of literature," establishing his role as a cultural nationalist.[^18]

His literary breakthrough came on January 1, 1917, when the serialization of *Mujeong* (*The Heartless*) began in the *Maeil Shinbo* newspaper.[^19] The novel was an immediate sensation—people reportedly walked for miles to get their daily copy.[^20] Written in modern vernacular Korean rather than classical Chinese-influenced literary language, *The Heartless* represented a revolutionary departure from traditional literary forms.[^21] The novel told the story of a love triangle during the Japanese occupation, depicting Korea at a crossroads between tradition and modernity, with characters representing different paths for the nation's future—Western education versus traditional Confucian values.[^22] The work went beyond romantic melodrama to address Korea's struggles with modern culture and national identity, establishing Yi as the father of modern Korean literature.[^23]

Simultaneously, Yi deepened his involvement in the independence movement. Returning to Korea in mid-November 1918, he advocated for national independence with Cheondoism leaders before returning to Japan in December.[^24] In January 1919, he joined the Korean Young People's Independence Organization and became the lead author of the historic February 8 Declaration of Independence.[^25] This declaration, proclaimed by Korean students in Tokyo on February 8, 1919, asserted that Korea was an independent state and served as a direct catalyst for the nationwide March First Movement protests that erupted across Korea.[^26] Yi left Japan via Kobe before the declaration was announced, avoiding the mass arrests of his compatriots, and traveled to Shanghai.[^27] He was tried and sentenced in absentia to nine months in prison.[^28]

In Shanghai, Yi settled into the French Concession and joined the Korean Provisional Government (KPG), the Korean nationalist government in exile.[^29] He became editor-in-chief of the organization's official newspaper, *Tongnip sinmun* (*The Independent*).[^30] His literary talents, political vision, and rhetorical skills made him one of the most prominent voices of the Korean independence movement during this period.[^31]

## Major Achievements

Yi Kwangsu's major achievements span both literature and early nationalist activism. His landmark novel *The Heartless* (1917) is now universally recognized as the first modern Korean novel and occupies a prominent place in the Korean literary canon, comparable to Natsume Soseki's *Kokoro* (1914) in Japan and Lu Xun's *The True Story of Ah Q* (1922) in China.[^32] In this seminal work, Yi criticized traditional value systems and customs while endorsing free love and the fulfillment of individual selfhood.[^33] He adopted a prose style that approximated the everyday speech of common people, making literature accessible to a broader audience and establishing the foundation for modern Korean literary language.[^34]

Yi's introduction of modern narrative techniques—psychological depth, complex character development, and the intertwining of personal experiences with social commentary—had a lasting impact on Korean literature and inspired subsequent generations of writers to explore themes of identity, social justice, and national consciousness.[^35] He reportedly developed the nickname "The Tolstoy of Korea," reflecting both his literary stature and the influence of Leo Tolstoy on his humanistic worldview.[^36]

Beyond *The Heartless*, Yi produced a substantial body of work. His 500-page epic *Heuk* (*The Soil*) was serialized in the *Dong-a Ilbo* from April 12, 1932, through July 10, 1933, in 272 short chapters.[^37] The novel tells the story of an idealist dedicating his life to helping rural communities and inspired an entire movement called "the enlightenment of farmers" (농촌계몽).[^38] *The Soil* remains an elemental part of the canon of modern Korean literature, recognized for its exploration of rural Korea and its vision of national renewal through grassroots development.[^39]

As a political activist, Yi's authorship of the February 8 Declaration of Independence stands as his most significant nationalist achievement.[^40] A recent discovery confirmed his authorship, with researchers at the Independence Hall noting that he had sent the document to independence activist Ahn Chang-ho.[^41] This declaration directly preceded the March First Movement, which became a major catalyst of the broader Korean independence movement.[^42]

In May 1922, Yi published his magnum opus of political thought, "Minjok kaejoron" (*On National Reconstruction*), in the magazine *Kaebyok* (*Creation*).[^43] This landmark essay provided a blueprint for the Korean nationalist movement and demonstrated Yi's expansive political vision and deep understanding of 1920s global intellectual currents, engaging with Le Bonianism, liberalism (John Dewey and Bertrand Russell), Marxism, and questions of colonial collaboration.[^44] The essay advocated for a vanguard-led cultural nationalism linking patriotism with economic development, apolitical education, and character reform—a form of gradualist pacifism that rejected revolutionary upheaval.[^45]

Upon returning to Korea in 1921, Yi founded the Alliance for Self-Improvement based on teachings from his mentor Ahn Chang-ho and became a registered member of Ahn's Young Korean Academy (Heungsadan) for preparing Korea's independence.[^46] From 1923 to 1934, he pursued a career in journalism, working for several major newspapers including the *Dong-a Ilbo* and the *Chosun Ilbo*, using these platforms to promote his vision of national renewal.[^47]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Yi Kwangsu's legacy is irreparably damaged by his collaboration with Imperial Japan during the latter part of his life—a betrayal so profound that the literary scholar Gim Hyeon described Yi as "a wound that becomes more painful the more one touches it."[^48] His transformation from passionate independence activist to collaborator represents one of the most controversial trajectories in modern Korean history.

The seeds of controversy appeared even during his nationalist period. When Yi published "On National Reconstruction" in 1922, the apolitical, gradualist ideas contained in the treatise sparked heated debate among intellectuals.[^49] University students were so outraged that they raided the *Kaebyok* newspaper headquarters and the homes of both Yi and the editor-in-chief Ch'oe Rin.[^50] Young men broke into Yi's house, threatened him with knives and swords, and called him "a national traitor."[^51] Leftist scholar Sin Sangu claimed that Yi was betraying the nation by suggesting drastic character reformation was needed in the Korean psyche, thereby disregarding Korea's rich history, enduring character, and the achievements of its great dynasties.[^52]

The decisive turn toward collaboration came after Yi's imprisonment in 1937 due to the Suyang Alumni Association incident.[^53] He was incarcerated by the imperial police and released half a year later due to illness; during this period he recanted his anti-Japanese stance.[^54] The motive for his full-fledged pro-Japanese activities was reportedly the death of his mentor Ahn Chang-ho in 1937, after which Yi appears to have lost his moral anchor.[^55]

In 1939, Yi became the first head of the pro-Japanese Korean Writers Association and led intense efforts to Japanize (hwangminhwa) Korea.[^56] He eagerly adopted the Japanese name Kayama Mitsurou as soon as the Sōshi-kaimei (name change) policy came into effect, becoming one of the first Koreans to willingly change his name.[^57] During World War II, Yi wrote pro-Japanese propaganda and actively encouraged Korean youth to join the Japanese military.[^58] In his autobiography *My Confessions*, Yi explained his rationale: "If we sent tens of thousands of young Koreans to the warfront for Japan, the Japanese people could not discriminate against us anymore. Serving in the military or in a munitions factory was compulsory anyway. Furthermore, the industrial and military training the young Koreans gained could greatly benefit Korea when liberated from Japan."[^59]

Leftist historians have long criticized Yi for driving Korean young men to the warfront through his writings and speeches.[^60] His collaboration was so shocking precisely because Yi Gwangsu had been Korean nationalism's central figure, deeply involved in constructing Korean national identity.[^61] When he betrayed the nation, readers were enraged and hurt because, as scholars noted, "they themselves had become Yi Gwangsu"—his writings had shaped their consciousness, making his betrayal feel deeply personal.[^62]

After Korea's liberation in 1945, Yi fled to the countryside.[^63] He was arrested for collaboration in February 1949 by the Special Committee for the Investigation of Anti-nationalist Activities (commonly known as the Banmin Special Committee) and imprisoned at Seodaemun Prison.[^64] He was released on medical parole in March and received a non-prosecution disposition in August.[^65] In December 1949, Yi published his autobiography *Naui Gobaek* (*My Confessions*), attempting to explain the circumstances of his actions during the occupation.[^66]

Yi also demonstrated problematic personal behavior beyond his political collaboration. He befriended and then abandoned fellow writer Kim Myeong-sun, allegedly because his own beliefs about modernism had shifted, demonstrating the sometimes volatile and self-serving nature of his personal relationships.[^67]

---

## Personal Life

Yi Kwangsu's personal life was marked by tragedy, complicated relationships, and eventual family discord. He first married at age 18 in July 1910 in what was possibly an arranged marriage to Paek Hyesun.[^68] However, after returning to Japan in 1915 to continue his studies, Yi fell seriously ill in 1918 and was nursed back to health by Hŏ Yŏngsuk.[^69] He fell in love with Hŏ, divorced his first wife in 1918, and married Hŏ in 1921.[^70]

Yi and Hŏ Yŏngsuk had five children together: three sons—Lee Chinkŭn, Lee Ponggŭn, and Lee Yŏnggŭn—and two daughters, Chung-Nan Lee Kim and Chung-Wha Lee Iyengar.[^71] His relationship with his mentor Ahn Chang-ho was so close that contemporaries recalled Yi often slipping into the northern Chŏngju accent when with hometown friends like Chu Yohan and his adopted father figure, An Ch'angho.[^72]

Yi's Buddhist engagement became significant in his later life. Although he had been educated in Christian mission schools, Yi rejected Christianity, particularly its interplay with Confucian teachings of self-control and self-negation, finding shelter instead in Buddhism.[^73] The third period of his career, from the 1930s onward, coincided with his conversion to Buddhism.[^74] His fictional representations of Buddhist figures and notions reflected his own Buddhist insights, particularly those entwined with his political experience of collaboration.[^75] Yi depicted the famous monk Wŏnhyo as a "p'agyesŭng" (transgressive monk) rather than as a conventionally great monk, paying attention to the unification wars in Wŏnhyo's time and depicting him as a person engrossed in the political and military concerns of Silla.[^76]

The trajectory of Yi's family life ended in tragedy. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, Yi was forcibly taken from his home in Seoul by invading communist soldiers and never seen again by his family.[^77] No one knew how the famous writer had died until the 1990s, when his son Lee Yŏnggŭn, by then a retired professor in Maryland, was allowed into North Korea to seek answers about his father's fate.[^78] It was determined that Yi had been captured by the North Korean army and died in Manpo on October 25, 1950, most likely of tuberculosis.[^79]

The pain of Yi's collaboration haunted even his children. His daughter appeared in an interview with the *Chosun Ilbo* on October 13, 2014, saying "I apologize to those who hate my father," leaving a statement about her father's pro-Japanese activities that demonstrated the enduring burden his family carried.[^80]

## Legacy

Yi Kwangsu's legacy remains one of the most contested and painful in modern Korean history. Despite his collaboration, he is still regarded as the father of modern Korean literature and a pioneer who ushered in Korea's modern vernacular literature and disseminated modern evaluative ideals such as individual subjectivity.[^81] His ability to intertwine personal experiences with social commentary set a precedent for future writers who sought to address contemporary issues through their works, enriching Korean literary tradition and inspiring waves of authors to explore themes of identity, social justice, and national consciousness.[^82]

*The Heartless* occupies a prominent place in the Korean literary canon and continues to be studied, translated, and debated.[^83] Following Yi Kwang-su, writers in the 1920s continued to experiment with more modern forms of fiction, building on the foundation he established.[^84] His works criticized the irrationality of old conventions shackled by Confucian traditions while advocating the enlightened views of his age.[^85] For the intellectuals of his generation, literature was a cultural bearer of emancipation and democracy and the Western apparatus of "Enlightenment."[^86]

However, Yi's place in world literary studies has often been obscured by his later collaboration with the colonial state, creating an enduring tension between recognizing his literary achievements and condemning his political betrayal.[^87] During the Cold War, when South Korea was under military dictatorship, the term "collaborator" (ch'inilp'a) functioned as a kind of prohibition, indicating that a person or certain texts were not worthy of serious scholarly attention.[^88] Collaboration was also a politically taboo topic since many South Korean political and military elites, including President Park Chung Hee, were former collaborators.[^89]

Though some important studies were published during this period, such as Im Chongguk's courageous *Ch'inil munhaknon* (*On literature by collaborator writers*) in 1966, it was not until after the victory of the democracy movement and the end of the Cold War that research on collaboration became active.[^90] Yi Gwangsu was Korean nationalism's tragic figure—his collaboration was traumatic precisely because he had been so central to Korean national identity construction.[^91]

The controversy around how to assess Yi Kwangsu continues today. Some argue it is time to reexamine, reinterpret, and reinstate Yi Kwangsu's thoughts and literary works, putting an end to the tendency to dismiss him simply as a pro-Japan collaborator.[^92] His literary influence is undeniable—Ch'ae Manshik's debut story "Segillo" (*In Three Directions*) was published in 1924 upon Yi's recommendation, demonstrating his role in nurturing subsequent literary talent.[^93]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars attempting to move beyond simple condemnation have sought to understand Yi Kwangsu within the broader structural contexts of colonialism and modernity. Some conceive of collaboration as "a structural feature of modernity" and situate the issue in broader, more international contexts rather than as individual moral failure alone.[^94] These scholars argue that Yi Kwangsu offers a compelling test case for how we might attempt to not only understand but also morally adjudicate support of Japan's occupation.[^95]

Yi's literary achievements remain undisputed among scholars. He is recognized as one of the pioneers of modern fiction and a leading voice in modern Korean literature.[^96] His contributions to Korean literary language—creating a modern vernacular prose style accessible to ordinary people—democratized literature and laid the foundation for all subsequent Korean fiction.[^97] The 1916 essay "What Is Literature" is still recognized as a pioneering work of literary theory that established critical frameworks for evaluating Korean literature.[^98]

Yi's early nationalist phase also receives scholarly recognition. His role in drafting the February 8 Declaration of Independence and his service in the Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai demonstrate genuine commitment to independence during the 1919-1921 period.[^99] His theories on ethno-nationalist movement or reformation are directly and mutually related to Ahn Chang-ho's ideology, and both were influential in the cultural nationalist movement that emphasized moral and educational development of the Korean people as a path to independence.[^100]

Contemporary literary scholars recognize that Yi's introduction of psychological depth, individual subjectivity, and social criticism into Korean fiction created possibilities that subsequent writers exploited.[^101] His influence on the development of the modern Korean novel form is compared to that of foundational figures in other national literatures.[^102] Some contemporary Korean critics argue that his literary legacy should be evaluated separately from his political collaboration, though this position remains controversial.[^103]

Pok Kŏil's 2003 work "A Defense for Those Who Have Died: The Issue of Japanese Collaboration in the 21st Century" represents attempts by some scholars to offer more sympathetic or contextual readings of collaboration.[^104] Recent scholarship has taken more nuanced approaches, examining Yi's choices within the framework of colonial power structures rather than reducing them to simple betrayal.[^105]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming weight of historical judgment condemns Yi Kwangsu's collaboration as an unforgivable betrayal of the Korean nation. The Special Committee for the Investigation of Anti-nationalist Activities found Yi guilty of collaboration after Korea's liberation, establishing his status as a condemned traitor in the official record of the Republic of Korea.[^106] He was arrested in February 1949 and faced formal prosecution for his actions during the colonial period.[^107]

Critics emphasize that Yi's collaboration was not passive acquiescence but active, enthusiastic participation in Imperial Japan's war effort and cultural suppression of Korea. As the first head of the pro-Japanese Korean Writers Association from 1939, he led efforts to Japanize Korea (hwangminhwa).[^108] He was among the first Koreans to eagerly adopt a Japanese name—Kayama Mitsurou—demonstrating symbolic submission to colonial power.[^109] His wartime writings actively encouraged Korean youth to join the Japanese military and die in Japan's imperial wars.[^110]

The betrayal was particularly devastating because of Yi's prior stature. As one scholar noted, Yi was "Korean nationalism's tragic figure" precisely because he had been "a prominent nationalist and was centrally involved in the construction of Korean national identity."[^111] His collaboration represented not just one individual's moral failure but a symbolic wounding of the entire nationalist project. Readers felt personally betrayed because Yi's writings had shaped their consciousness—"they themselves had become Yi Gwangsu."[^112]

Contemporary critics during his lifetime recognized the danger Yi represented. When young men broke into his house in 1922 and threatened him with weapons, calling him "a national traitor," they were reacting to what they perceived as his gradualist accommodation to colonial power even before his full collaboration began.[^113] Leftist scholar Sin Sangu's criticism that Yi was disregarding Korea's rich history and achievements proved prescient.[^114]

Modern Korean historians and literary critics continue to grapple with how to assess Yi. Many argue that literary achievements cannot be separated from moral choices, particularly when those choices involved actively harming the nation through propaganda that sent young Koreans to their deaths.[^115] The trauma of Yi's betrayal remains so painful that one literary scholar described him as "a wound that becomes more painful the more one touches it"—his case continues to provoke anguish rather than scholarly distance.[^116]

The enduring controversy is captured in the question posed by scholars: "Patriot, Traitor, or Both?"[^117] While some recent scholars influenced by postcolonial theory and cultural studies attempt to reconceptualize collaboration in ways that produce new readings, the dominant historical judgment in Korea remains deeply condemnatory.[^118] For most Koreans, Yi Kwangsu's collaboration erased whatever positive contributions he made to literature and early nationalism, leaving him as an enduring symbol of betrayal and the moral compromises of the colonial period.[^119]
