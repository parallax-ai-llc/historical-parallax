## Summary

Katherine Johnson was an American mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics were critical to the success of early US space flights. She calculated trajectories for Alan Shepard's first spaceflight, John Glenn's orbital mission, and the Apollo 11 Moon landing. As an African-American woman at NASA, she overcame both racial and gender barriers. Her story was popularized by the 2016 book and film 'Hidden Figures.'
