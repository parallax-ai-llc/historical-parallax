## Overview

The discovery of penicillin marks the beginning of modern medicine's "antibiotic era." In 1928, Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming returned from holiday to find a mold had accidentally contaminated a petri dish of *Staphylococcus* bacteria—and was killing the bacteria. This accidental observation led to the isolation of penicillin. However, it took another decade and the work of Howard Florey, Ernst Chain, and Norman Heatley to turn Fleming's unstable curiosity into a mass-produced life-saving drug just in time for D-Day and World War II. It has saved an estimated 200 million lives.

## Background

### Pre-Antibiotic Era

**"The Captain of the Men of Death":**
Before antibiotics, a scratch from a rose thorn, a blister, or a sore throat (strep) could kill.
- Pneumonia, syphilis, gonorrhea, meningitis often fatal.
- Surgery and childbirth extremely dangerous (sepsis).

**Treatments:**
Arsenic, mercury, sulfa drugs (developed 1930s, toxic/limited).

## The Discovery

### Alexander Fleming

**St. Mary's Hospital, London:**
Fleming was a brilliant but messy researcher.

**September 28, 1928:**
Returned from vacation. Noticed a petri dish left near open window.
- Mold (*Penicillium notatum*) had grown.
- **Zone of Inhibition:** Bacteria around the mold were dead/dissolved.
- Further away, bacteria grew normally.

**"That's funny."** — Fleming's reaction.

### The "Mold Juice"

Fleming published paper (1929). Found "mold juice" killed many bacteria.
**Problem:** Hard to isolate. Unstable. Fleming moved on.

## The Oxford Team (1938-1941)

### Howard Florey & Ernst Chain

**University of Oxford:**
Ernst Chain (Jewish refugee from Nazis) found Fleming's paper. Howard Florey (Australian) organized team to isolate it.

**Norman Heatley:**
Genius engineer. Figured out how to extract penicillin using bedpans, milk churns, and bathtubs.

### First Patient (1941)

**Albert Alexander:**
Policeman scratched by rose bush. Dying of sepsis. Eyes gone, abscesses everywhere.
Given experimental penicillin.
**Result:** Miracle recovery within 24 hours.
**Tragedy:** Supply ran out. Recycled penicillin from his urine. Still ran out. He relapsed and died.
**Lesson:** Drug works, but need massive quantities.

## Mass Production

### WWII Urgency

British factories bombed. Florey flew to USA (1941) with mold spores rubbed into his coat (in case of capture/crash).

### The Cantaloupe

**Peoria, Illinois:**
US researchers found a stronger strain of mold on a **moldy cantaloupe** in a market.
Developed deep-tank fermentation.

### D-Day (1944)

By 1944, US produced enough for all Allied troops.
- **Gangrene:** Virtually eliminated.
- **Venereal Disease:** Cured quickly.
- Difference maker: Axis powers had no penicillin (German wounded died of infection).

## Nobel Prize (1945)

Shared by:
- **Alexander Fleming** (Discovery)
- **Howard Florey** (Development)
- **Ernst Chain** (Development)

fleming became the celebrity, but Oxford team did the heavy lifting.

## Warning

### Antibiotic Resistance

In his Nobel speech (1945), Fleming warned:
> "The thoughtless person playing with penicillin treatment is morally responsible for the death of the man who succumbs to infection with the penicillin-resistant organism."

Prophetic. Resistance is now global crisis.

## Legacy

### Medical Revolution

- Simple infections no longer death sentence
- Chemotherapy, organ transplants, complex surgery made possible (prevent infection)
- Average life expectancy increased ~10 years

### Pharmaceutical Industry

Launched era of drug discovery.
