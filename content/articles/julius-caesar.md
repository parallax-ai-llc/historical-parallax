## Summary

Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BC) was a Roman military and political leader whose conquest of Gaul, crossing of the Rubicon, and subsequent civil war destroyed the Roman Republic and paved the way for the Roman Empire. As dictator, his centralization of power and populist policies made him enemies among the Senate, leading to his assassination on the Ides of March, 44 BC. His life and death became a defining moment in Western history, inspiring everything from Shakespeare to modern political theory.
