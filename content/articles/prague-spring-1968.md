## Overview
Under Alexander Dubček, Czechoslovakia introduced reforms to grant additional rights to citizens and loosen restrictions on the media, aiming for "socialism with a human face." The period is commonly called the *Prague Spring*.

## What Changed (Key Reforms)
- **Press and speech**: loosened censorship; public debate became possible.
- **Political and civic life**: greater openness inside the Communist Party; limited space for civil society.
- **Economic direction**: proposals to decentralize and modernize the economy.
- **Federalization**: moves toward a more balanced Czech–Slovak arrangement.

## Why It Mattered
The reforms tested whether a Warsaw Pact state could liberalize while remaining within the Soviet sphere. For many observers, it became a defining moment of the Cold War: the boundary between tolerated reform and unacceptable autonomy.

## Invasion
The Soviet Union, fearing the spread of liberal ideas, led a Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, halting the reforms and re-establishing hardline communist rule.

## Aftermath ("Normalization")
- Dubček was removed from power; reformers were sidelined.
- The period known as **Normalization** restored censorship and political control.
- Many citizens faced surveillance, career penalties, and travel restrictions.

## Key People
- **Alexander Dubček**: First Secretary who led reforms.
- **Leonid Brezhnev**: Soviet leader associated with the decision to intervene.
- **Ludvík Svoboda**: Czechoslovak president during the crisis.

## Timeline
- **1968-01-05**: Dubček becomes First Secretary.
- **1968 (spring–summer)**: Reform program expands public freedoms.
- **1968-08**: Warsaw Pact invasion; reforms halted.
- **1969+**: "Normalization" consolidates.
