## Overview
Under Alexander Dubček, Czechoslovakia introduced reforms to grant additional rights to citizens and loosen restrictions on the media, aiming for "socialism with a human face."

## Invasion
The Soviet Union, fearing the spread of liberal ideas, led a Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, halting the reforms and re-establishing hardline communist rule.
