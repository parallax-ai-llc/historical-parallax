## Summary

Caracalla (188-217 CE), born Lucius Septimius Bassianus, was a Roman emperor who ruled from 211 to 217 CE.[^1] Known for his military clothing style and the Gallic hooded cloak that gave him his nickname, Caracalla is remembered as both a brutal tyrant and the architect of one of Rome's most significant legal reforms.[^2] His reign was marked by the murder of his brother Geta, the issuance of the Constitutio Antoniniana granting citizenship to all free men in the empire, and the construction of the magnificent Baths of Caracalla.[^3] Ancient sources describe him as cruel and paranoid, yet modern historians recognize his complex legacy that combined violence with substantial administrative achievements.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Caracalla was born on April 4, 188 CE in Lugdunum, Gaul (modern-day Lyon, France), where his father Septimius Severus was serving as governor.[^5] His birth name was Lucius Septimius Bassianus, named after his maternal grandfather Julius Bassianus, who held the hereditary office of high priest to the Syrian sun god Elagabalus in Emesa (modern Homs, Syria).[^6] His mother, Julia Domna, came from a wealthy and prominent Arab priestly family and was known for her intelligence, love of philosophy, and political acumen.[^7]

Julia Domna had a privileged childhood in Emesa, a wealthy city on an important trade route, where she was exposed to the finest elements of civilization.[^8] She married Septimius Severus in 187 CE, and the couple would have two sons: Caracalla in 188 and Geta in 189.[^9] Emperor Severus truly valued Julia Domna's political ideas, and she became well-known for her intellectual pursuits, earning titles such as "Mother of the Camp" and often accompanying her husband on military campaigns.[^10]

At age seven, in 195 or 196 CE, Caracalla was given the imperial rank of Caesar and adopted the name Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesar as part of his father's attempt at union with the families of Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius.[^11] This strategic renaming connected the new Severan dynasty to the respected Antonine emperors who had preceded them. While detailed records of Caracalla's formal education are scarce, he grew up in an environment of political intrigue and military campaigns, with his mother's intellectual and philosophical interests likely influencing the cultural atmosphere of his upbringing.[^12]

In 197 CE, Caracalla received the title of Designate (imperator destinatus), signaling he would succeed his father as emperor.[^13] On January 28, 198 CE, at just nine years old, Caracalla was appointed joint Augustus and full co-emperor by his father, making him one of the youngest individuals ever to hold such high imperial rank.[^14] This early elevation to power meant that by his twenties, Caracalla had extensive military experience from campaigns alongside Severus.[^15] In 208, Septimius embarked for Britain to campaign in Caledonia, taking with him both sons and their mother, further immersing young Caracalla in the military life that would define his reign.[^16]

## Rise to Power

Caracalla's ascent to sole imperial authority was gradual and ultimately violent. As co-emperor from 198 CE, he served alongside his father in various military and administrative capacities, holding consulships in 202, 205, 208, and 213 CE.[^17] In 202 CE, Caracalla married Plautilla, daughter of the powerful Praetorian Prefect Gaius Plautianus, in a political alliance that would prove short-lived.[^18] When Plautianus fell from grace and was killed in 205 CE, Caracalla immediately exiled his wife Plautilla, demonstrating early signs of his ruthless political instincts.[^19]

The critical transition came on February 4, 211 CE, when Septimius Severus died at Eboracum (modern York, England) while on campaign in Britain.[^20] Before his death, Severus reportedly advised his sons to "be harmonious, enrich the soldiers, and scorn all others," counsel that would heavily influence Caracalla's reign.[^21] Caracalla and his younger brother Geta jointly inherited the throne as co-emperors, but their relationship was catastrophically dysfunctional.[^22]

The brothers eyed each other with deep suspicion and failed to cooperate on government appointments and policy decisions.[^23] The paranoia between them was so extreme that on the voyage back to Rome, neither would even sit at the same table with the other for fear of poisoning.[^24] Ancient sources indicate that Caracalla was being advised to have Geta murdered, and after at least one unsuccessful attempt, the fratricidal plan came to fruition.[^25]

In December 211 CE, their mother Julia Domna organized a reconciliation meeting in her apartments, desperately trying to broker peace between her warring sons.[^26] Instead, this meeting became the site of one of history's most infamous acts of fratricide. Caracalla had arranged for centurions loyal to him to be present, and Geta was brutally murdered by this group of Praetorian Guard members, dying in his mother's arms.[^27] Julia Domna was stained with her son's blood and wounded in the hand by a gladius sword as she tried to protect Geta.[^28]

Following Geta's assassination, Caracalla launched an unprecedented campaign of terror against his brother's supporters and anyone associated with him.[^29] The purge was ruthless and extensive, with estimates suggesting as many as 20,000 people were executed in the aftermath, including senators, advisors, friends, and allies of Geta.[^30] To further eliminate his brother from history, Caracalla ordered a comprehensive damnatio memoriae—condemnation of memory—against Geta that was unparalleled in Roman history.[^31] Inscriptions mentioning Geta were hammered away, his name was struck from coins and papyri, and statues in his likeness were destroyed throughout the empire.[^32] The Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome still bears evidence of this erasure, with Geta's name visibly removed from the inscription.[^33] Caracalla thus emerged as sole emperor, having secured his position through the most brutal means imaginable.

## Major Achievements

Despite his reputation for cruelty, Caracalla's reign produced several significant achievements that left lasting impacts on the Roman Empire and subsequent history.

### The Constitutio Antoniniana (212 CE)

The most consequential act of Caracalla's reign was the issuance of the Constitutio Antoniniana, also known as the Edict of Caracalla, in 212 CE.[^34] This landmark decree granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Roman Empire, with exceptions only for the dediticii (people who had become subject to Rome through surrender in war) and freed slaves.[^35] All free women in the Empire were simultaneously granted the same rights as Roman women, including the jus trium liberorum.[^36]

Before this edict, Roman citizenship had been a privileged status. At the death of Augustus in 14 CE, only about 4-7% of all peoples in the Roman Empire were Roman citizens, with the majority being inhabitants of Roman Italia.[^37] Caracalla's edict fundamentally transformed the legal landscape of the empire, marking a shift toward a more inclusive formal status for provincials.[^38] As historian Anthony Kaldellis stated, "The Empire became the world."[^39]

The edict is preserved on a papyrus in Giessen, Germany, and its motivations have been debated by scholars.[^40] According to the ancient historian Cassius Dio, one purpose was fiscal: the edict widened the obligation for public service and increased state revenue through inheritance and emancipation taxes that only Roman citizens had to pay.[^41] The papyrus itself describes another purpose as appeasing the gods who had delivered Caracalla from conspiracy.[^42] Additionally, extending citizenship increased the pool of men eligible to join the Roman legions, as only those with full citizenship could serve as legionaries.[^43]

The Constitutio Antoniniana has been recognized as the first in a series of world-historically important documents of civil and human rights and constitutional history, alongside the Magna Carta (1215), the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV (1356), and the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789).[^44] The concept of a single law for all peoples became more of a reality, as Caracalla effectively brought millions of people under the protection and jurisdiction of Roman courts and legal procedures.[^45]

### The Baths of Caracalla

Caracalla's second great achievement was the construction of the Baths of Caracalla (Thermae Antoninianae), commissioned in 212 CE and partially opened by 216 CE.[^46] These baths became the city's second-largest Roman public bathing complex after the Baths of Diocletian and among the most beautiful and luxurious baths in all of Rome.[^47]

The massive structure covered an area of 750 by 380 feet (230 by 115 meters), with broken vaults, towering arches, and expansive walls soaring as high as 130 feet into the air.[^48] Designed to accommodate about 1,600 bathers at a time, with a daily capacity of 6,000 to 8,000 people, the baths were far more than places to bathe—they were cultural centers featuring libraries, gardens, and gymnasiums.[^49]

The architectural engineering was remarkable. Eight enormous gray granite columns from Egypt supported the high, vaulted ceiling of the Great Hall.[^50] The building was heated by a hypocaust system, burning coal and wood underneath the ground to heat water provided by a dedicated aqueduct, the Aqua Antoniniana (a branch of the earlier Aqua Marcia).[^51] The walls and floors were covered with lavish amounts of white and colored marble, which combined with many statues and large glass windows to create a place of splendor, light, and beautiful architecture.[^52]

The Baths of Caracalla served as inspiration for many notable buildings both ancient and modern, including the Baths of Diocletian, the Basilica of Maxentius, the original Pennsylvania Station in New York City, Chicago Union Station, and the Senate of Canada Building.[^53] They continued in use until the 6th century and remain standing today as an enduring architectural testimony to the scale of Roman public works and to imperial patronage of urban life.[^54]

### Military Victories

Caracalla achieved several military successes during his reign. In 213-214 CE, he campaigned against the Alamanni, a confederation of Germanic tribes who had broken through the limes (frontier) in Raetia.[^55] Caracalla successfully defeated some Germanic tribes while settling other difficulties through diplomacy, though precisely with whom these treaties were made remains unknown.[^56] He responded to the Alamanni threat by occupying their territory in the Main River basin and massacring their men of military age.[^57] Critically, Caracalla strengthened the frontier fortifications of Raetia and Germania Superior, collectively known as the Agri Decumates, enabling them to withstand further barbarian invasions for another twenty years.[^58] For these victories, he was awarded the title Germanicus Maximus.[^59]

### Currency and Economic Measures

In 215 CE, Caracalla introduced a new Roman coin called the antoninianus, ostensibly a "double denarius" worth two denarii.[^60] The coin was struck in a silver-copper alloy with around 50% silver content and featured a distinctive radiate crown on the obverse.[^61] However, the antoninianus actually weighed only 1.5 denarii (initially around 5.11 grams, or 2.6 grams of silver instead of the implied 3.3 grams), representing a form of currency debasement.[^62] While intended as a way to increase coin production without further debasing the denarius, the long-term economic consequences would prove devastating during the Crisis of the Third Century.[^63]

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

Caracalla's reign was marked by numerous acts of brutality and poor judgment that have led ancient and modern historians to rank him among Rome's worst emperors.

### The Fratricide and Mass Purges

The murder of his brother Geta in December 211 CE remains the defining atrocity of Caracalla's reign.[^64] The killing of a co-emperor and brother was shocking enough, but Caracalla compounded this crime with extensive purges targeting thousands of Geta's supporters.[^65] Classical sources estimate that approximately 20,000 people were executed in the aftermath, though this number may be exaggerated.[^66] The systematic damnatio memoriae against Geta was extraordinarily thorough—nearly every portrait of Geta in marble was hacked to remove his features, and inscriptions bearing his name were systematically altered across the entire empire.[^67] The famous Severan Tondo clearly portrays Septimius Severus, his wife, and Caracalla as a smiling family, while Geta's face has been literally scraped from the portrait.[^68]

### The Alexandria Massacre (215 CE)

One of the most notorious episodes of Caracalla's reign occurred in Alexandria, Egypt, in late 215 CE.[^69] Both Roman historians Cassius Dio and Herodian report that Caracalla traveled to Alexandria ostensibly to pay his respects at the tomb of Alexander the Great but instead carried out a great massacre of the local population.[^70] Ancient historians record that Caracalla was enraged because the Alexandrians had mocked his rise to power and his claim to have killed Geta in self-defense.[^71]

In retaliation for this satire, Caracalla ordered the massacre of prominent citizens in Alexandria, and thousands were killed while the city was plundered.[^72] He sentenced to death the administrators of the province, exterminated Alexandrian entrepreneurs, and in April 216 massacred inhabitants of the city.[^73] However, the reasons may have been more complex than simple mockery—citizens of Alexandria had used considerable violence against Roman soldiers, and Herodian confirms that "a number of soldiers perished there too."[^74] The lawlessness was made possible because the garrison, the Legio II Traiana, had been sent to the Rhine area in 213 CE, leaving the city more vulnerable to both civil unrest and imperial retribution.[^75]

### Personality and Mental State

Ancient sources present a damning portrait of Caracalla's character. In his many portraits, the expression of vehemence and cruelty is obvious, and sources indicate that he intentionally reinforced this impression, perhaps because it flattered his vanity to spread fear and terror.[^76] He was known for frequent purges of political enemies and perceived threats, with his distrust extending even to his closest advisors and the Praetorian Guard.[^77] This constant fear of assassination made his rule increasingly erratic and despotic.[^78]

Cassius Dio, one of the primary ancient sources, notes that Caracalla was descended from three different races and managed to combine all their faults into one person: the fickleness, cowardice, and recklessness of the Gauls, the cruelty and harshness of the Africans, and the craftiness associated with the Syrians.[^79] A similar inconsistency characterizes judgments about his mental state—he was said to be mad but also sharp-minded and ready-witted.[^80] His predilection for gods of health, documented by numerous dedicatory inscriptions, may support theories of mental illness.[^81]

### Economic Mismanagement

While Caracalla increased soldiers' pay by 50% to maintain their loyalty, raising annual military pay from 1,600 sesterces to 2,400 sesterces, he did so without adequate means of funding these increases.[^82] He also devalued major coins: the aureus to 6.6 grams of gold, the denarius to 51.5% silver, and the sestertius to 24.8 grams of brass.[^83] When his mother Julia Domna criticized him for excessive spending on the military and noted that "There is no longer any source of revenue, either just or unjust, left to us," Caracalla responded by showing his sword and declaring, "Be of good cheer, mother: for as long as we have this, we shall not run short of money."[^84] This quote reveals his willingness to use force and extortion to extract revenue.

### Failed Parthian Campaign

In 216 CE, Caracalla began a campaign against the Parthian Empire that would prove largely unsuccessful.[^85] According to both Cassius Dio and Herodian, Caracalla justified his war on dubious grounds, claiming that the Parthian King Artabanus had denied his request to marry the king's daughter.[^86] During a celebration of Caracalla's arrival, probably at the Parthian royal palace in Arbela, Caracalla treacherously ordered his troops to massacre the guests.[^87] The campaign was still ongoing when Caracalla was assassinated in 217 CE, leaving it incomplete and achieving little of strategic value.[^88]

## Personal Life

Caracalla's personal life was characterized by his identification with military culture and his complex family relationships.

### Family Dynamics

Caracalla's relationship with his mother Julia Domna was complex and enduring. After he murdered Geta in her arms, she nevertheless continued to serve in an advisory capacity during his reign.[^89] Julia Domna killed herself in 217 upon hearing of Caracalla's assassination and the Severan dynasty's loss of power, suggesting a deep connection despite the trauma of Geta's death.[^90]

His marriage to Plautilla in 202 CE was purely political and evidently unhappy.[^91] When her father Plautianus fell from power in 205 CE, Caracalla immediately exiled her, demonstrating no personal attachment.[^92] Ancient sources provide little information about other romantic relationships or personal friendships, suggesting Caracalla lived an isolated existence defined more by military camaraderie than intimate personal bonds.

### Military Identity and Lifestyle

Caracalla cultivated a powerful military identity throughout his reign. He showed a remarkable ability to win the sympathy of soldiers by marching on foot among ordinary legionaries, eating the same food, and even grinding his own flour with them.[^93] This populist approach to military leadership earned him genuine loyalty from the troops, who saw him as a fellow soldier rather than a distant aristocrat.[^94]

His nickname "Caracalla" derived from the Gallic hooded cloak he habitually wore and made fashionable.[^95] According to the 4th-century historian Aurelius Victor, this caracalla was a heavy woolen outer cape, hooded, sleeveless, and fastened down the front, reaching beneath the knees and giving full protection against harsh weather.[^96] Herodian describes Caracalla as having preferred northern European clothing, making the short Gaulish cloak fashionable throughout the empire.[^97] The name originally had pejorative connotations and was never an official designation, yet it became how history would remember him.[^98]

### Physical Appearance

In his official portraiture, Caracalla abandoned the luxuriant hair and beard of his predecessors for a military style characterized by closely cropped curls and a stubble beard.[^99] He is shown with short beard and mustache, broad nose, eyes with incised irises and drilled crescentic pupils, incised eyebrows, and deeply furrowed brow and forehead.[^100] The most distinctive portrait type features a deep, downward frown on the forehead and a strong leftward rotation of the head, creating an intense, almost threatening facial expression.[^101]

These portraits were long interpreted negatively, but modern scholars suggest that Caracalla's distinctive appearance was meant to express military virtue (virtus), originating from artistic traditions within Roman state relief.[^102] The expression may be interpreted as one of concern or perceived threat, while the rotation of the head suggests alertness and implies action.[^103] The most famous portrait is held at the Vatican Museums, of which several copies are known.[^104]

## Legacy

Caracalla's legacy is profoundly contested, balancing significant administrative achievements against documented brutality and mismanagement.

### Architectural and Cultural Impact

The Baths of Caracalla remain Caracalla's most visible and enduring legacy.[^105] Still standing nearly two millennia after their construction, they continue to inspire architects and serve as a venue for cultural events in modern Rome.[^106] The baths' influence on later architecture extended across centuries and continents, from Roman buildings like the Baths of Diocletian to modern structures like Pennsylvania Station in New York City.[^107] This architectural legacy demonstrates how emperors could shape urban life and cultural practices for generations through monumental public works.[^108]

### Legal and Citizenship Legacy

The Constitutio Antoniniana fundamentally transformed the Roman Empire by extending citizenship to virtually all free inhabitants.[^109] This created a more unified legal framework across the empire's diverse territories and populations, though it also diluted the formerly exclusive privileges of citizenship.[^110] The edict's importance to legal and constitutional history cannot be overstated—it represents an early milestone in the expansion of civil rights and the concept of universal legal personhood within a political community.[^111]

Modern legal historians recognize this edict as a precursor to later constitutional documents that expanded citizenship and rights.[^112] While Caracalla's motivations may have been primarily fiscal and military, the long-term consequences helped create a more integrated imperial society, even as the empire faced increasing pressures in the third century.[^113]

### Military and Political Legacy

Caracalla's relationship with the Roman army established a dangerous precedent for the third century. By dramatically increasing military pay and portraying himself as a soldier-emperor, he reinforced the military's political preeminence and set expectations that successors struggled to meet.[^114] His reliance on military loyalty over senatorial cooperation contributed to the pattern of soldier-emperors that would characterize the Crisis of the Third Century.[^115]

His assassination by Julius Martialis in 217 CE demonstrated the limits of even military popularity when personal resentments and political conspiracies aligned.[^116] The fact that Macrinus, the Praetorian Prefect who orchestrated the assassination, succeeded him as emperor showed how precarious imperial authority had become when it rested primarily on military support.[^117]

### Historical Memory

Caracalla's memory was not subject to official damnatio memoriae, unlike the fate he imposed on his brother Geta.[^118] After his death, senators in Rome denounced him, likening him to all the tyrants of the past who had ruled over them, according to Cassius Dio's account.[^119] Throughout late antiquity and the medieval period, Caracalla's reputation remained overwhelmingly negative, with his name synonymous with cruelty and fratricide.[^120]

The moralizing about fratricide by both ancient and modern historians has sometimes obscured the energetic, reformist, and even intellectual character of aspects of his reign.[^121] His mother Julia Domna's philosophical circle and patronage of arts and letters continued during his reign, suggesting the imperial court was not entirely dominated by military brutality.[^122] Nevertheless, the consensus of both ancient and modern sources is that Caracalla's reign contributed to the decay and instability that would nearly destroy the empire in the decades following his death.[^123]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Despite the overwhelmingly negative ancient sources, some modern scholars have identified aspects of Caracalla's reign worthy of recognition and even praise.

Caracalla's issuance of the Constitutio Antoniniana represents a watershed moment in legal history that expanded rights to millions of people previously excluded from full citizenship.[^124] Some historians argue this was a genuinely progressive measure that, regardless of its fiscal motivations, advanced the concept of universal citizenship and legal equality.[^125] As one modern assessment notes, "his declaration extending citizenship changed the legal landscape of the empire and marked a shift toward a more inclusive formal status for provincials."[^126]

His architectural patronage produced one of Rome's greatest monuments, demonstrating his capacity for grand vision and effective administration when focused on constructive projects.[^127] The Baths of Caracalla provided enormous social benefit to Rome's population, offering not just bathing facilities but libraries, exercise areas, and gardens that served as democratic public spaces accessible to ordinary citizens.[^128]

Recent scholarship has treated Caracalla with a degree of nuance, acknowledging the real harms of his repressive acts while also recognizing administrative and infrastructural actions that had longer-term positive effects on the empire.[^129] Some historians note that ancient sources, particularly Cassius Dio, may have been hostile to Caracalla due to senatorial bias, and thus their accounts should be treated with caution.[^130] Historian Clare Rowan specifically questions Dio's accuracy regarding Caracalla, noting the work presents a hostile attitude that requires careful critical evaluation.[^131]

Additionally, Caracalla was reportedly an able judge when hearing court cases, suggesting he possessed genuine administrative competence in legal matters beyond the Constitutio Antoniniana.[^132] His strengthening of frontier fortifications in Germania proved effective, protecting the region for two decades after his death.[^133] His genuine connection with ordinary soldiers, marching and eating alongside them, demonstrated a capacity for empathy and solidarity that contrasted with his cruelty toward elites and political enemies.[^134]

### Negative Views

The overwhelming consensus of both ancient and modern historians is that Caracalla was one of Rome's worst emperors, whose reign was characterized by violence, paranoia, and misrule.

Ancient sources are nearly unanimous in their condemnation. Cassius Dio, whose account is considered the most valuable literary source for this period, presents Caracalla as cruel, paranoid, and destructive to senatorial authority.[^135] Herodian's History of the Roman Empire covers Caracalla's reign with considerable detail, emphasizing his military pretensions and violent temperament.[^136] The Historia Augusta, while less reliable than other sources, provides the most extensive biography of Caracalla and paints him as thoroughly depraved, though scholars recognize this account contains fabricated elements alongside genuine historical information.[^137]

Modern historians have largely endorsed these negative ancient assessments while adding analytical frameworks. Caracalla's reign is judged as marked by violence, fiscal strain, and an intensification of the army's political preeminence that destabilized the empire.[^138] The murder of Geta and subsequent purges killed thousands and eliminated much of the empire's administrative and political talent, creating governance problems that persisted throughout his reign.[^139]

The Alexandria massacre demonstrates Caracalla's capacity for disproportionate violence motivated by personal pique.[^140] His treacherous massacre of Parthian nobles during peace negotiations violated fundamental norms of diplomatic conduct and undermined Rome's credibility in eastern diplomacy.[^141] The economic consequences of his policies, particularly currency debasement and unsustainable military spending, contributed to the inflation and fiscal crisis of the third century.[^142]

Classical authors such as Cassius Dio and Herodian emphasize his cruelty and soldierly manner, and this negative profile influenced medieval and modern depictions of his rule.[^143] The overall assessment of Caracalla's reign by contemporary and later historians is overwhelmingly negative, with his few achievements overshadowed by his documented brutality and poor judgment.[^144]

One modern scholar summarized the historical consensus: "Caracalla, whose reign contributed to the decay of the empire, has often been regarded as one of the most bloodthirsty tyrants in Roman history."[^145] While some nuance has been introduced by recent scholarship, the fundamental assessment remains that Caracalla's reign was disastrous for the Roman Empire and its people.[^146]
