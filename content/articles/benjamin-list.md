## Summary

Benjamin List is a German chemist who shared the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with David MacMillan for the development of asymmetric organocatalysis. He discovered that the amino acid proline can catalyze chemical reactions enantioselectively, providing a third type of catalysis beyond metal and enzyme catalysis. This has made chemical synthesis more environmentally friendly and efficient.
