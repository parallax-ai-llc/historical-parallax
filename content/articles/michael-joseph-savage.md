## Summary

Michael Joseph Savage (1872-1940) served as New Zealand's 23rd Prime Minister from 1935 until his death in 1940, leading the country's First Labour Government and becoming the architect of New Zealand's pioneering welfare state.[^1] Born in Australia to Irish immigrant parents, Savage emigrated to New Zealand in 1907 at age 35, where he rose through the trade union movement to become Labour Party leader in 1933.[^2] His government introduced the groundbreaking Social Security Act of 1938, establishing universal healthcare and comprehensive welfare benefits that made New Zealand a world leader in social reform.[^3] Often called "Everybody's Uncle" for his genial personality and charismatic oratory, Savage died at the height of his popularity and is widely regarded by historians and the New Zealand public as one of the nation's greatest prime ministers.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Michael Joseph Savage was born on 23 March 1872 at Tatong, near Benalla in Victoria, Australia, the youngest of eight children of Irish immigrants Richard Savage and his wife, Johanna Hayes.[^5] His early childhood was marked by tragedy when his mother died in 1878, leaving five-year-old Michael to be raised largely by his sister Rose.[^6] After attending for five years the tiny state school at Rothesay, where his father owned a small farm, Savage began working in a Benalla wine and spirits shop from 1886 to 1893.[^7] During this time he also attended night classes at Benalla College, pursuing education despite his working-class circumstances.[^8]

In 1891, Savage experienced profound personal loss when both his sister Rose, who had been his primary caretaker, died in childbirth, and his closest brother Joe also passed away.[^9] Devastated by these deaths, Savage adopted his brother's name and from then on was known as Michael Joseph Savage rather than simply Michael Savage.[^10] This period of grief seemed to mark a turning point in his life, deepening his empathy for human suffering that would later characterize his political career.

After losing his retail job during the 1893 depression, Savage worked as a labourer and irrigation ditch-digger on North Yanco station in New South Wales, with membership in the General Laborers' and Australian Workers' unions.[^11] In 1900 he moved to North Prentice, near Rutherglen, Victoria, becoming a goldminer, stationary-engine driver and foundation manager of a co-operative bakery.[^12] It was during this period that Savage's political consciousness awakened through exposure to socialist ideas and the labor movement.

Brought up in the Roman Catholic religion, Savage for much of his adult life was a militant rationalist, though he would return to the Catholic church a few years before his death.[^13] Influenced by the British socialist evangelist Tom Mann in 1904, Savage became active not only in the local miners' union but also in the Political Labor Council of Victoria.[^14] Converted to socialism and active politics by Mann, Savage became a branch and electorate secretary of the Victorian Political Labor Council, unsuccessfully advocating for the socialist objective at its 1906 and 1907 conferences.[^15] Selected to stand for the State seat of Wangaratta and Rutherglen in 1907, after missing selection narrowly for the Federal seat of Indi, he had to withdraw because of financial difficulties.[^16] This disappointment led him to emigrate to New Zealand in October 1907, arriving in Wellington on Labour Day, 9 October 1907.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Upon arriving in Auckland, Savage found employment at Hancock and Co., a brewery, and soon after beginning work he joined the Auckland Brewers' Union and quickly became president of the 154 member union.[^18] His natural leadership abilities and organizing skills propelled him rapidly through the labor movement. By 1910, he was elected president of the Auckland Trades and Labour Council, establishing himself as a prominent voice for working people in New Zealand's largest city.[^19]

Savage supported the formation of the New Zealand Labour Party in July 1916 and was active in local politics before his election to the House of Representatives in 1919, as one of eight Labour members returned in that election.[^20] His entry into Parliament came at a time when the Labour Party was still a minor force in New Zealand politics, struggling to gain credibility and electoral support. Three years later, in 1922, he became Labour's deputy leader, positioning himself as a key figure in the party's leadership.[^21]

When Labour leader Harry Holland died in 1933, Peter Fraser endorsed Michael Joseph Savage, Holland's more moderate deputy, and Fraser became the new deputy leader.[^22] Savage was elected unopposed as Labour Party leader in 1933, though there were doubts in some quarters at the time of his election whether he had sufficient ability and personality for the job.[^23] However, Savage would prove his critics wrong through his ability to connect with ordinary New Zealanders and his skill at articulating Labour's vision in accessible, non-threatening terms.

During the Great Depression, Savage toured the country extensively and became an iconic figure, visiting communities devastated by unemployment and economic hardship.[^24] An excellent speaker, he became the most visible politician in the land, using simple language that resonated with struggling families.[^25] Unlike his well-read deputy, Peter Fraser, Savage seldom referred to books in his speeches.[^26] Instead, he spoke of giving people a "fair deal," getting the bosses and interest groups off their backs, and stopping people from going "bankrupt amidst plenty."[^27]

In his speeches during the 1935 election campaign, Savage made great efforts to allay middle-class fears, to minimize the novel, radical, or socialist content of the party's policy, and to emphasize that Labour sought only to perpetuate the New Zealand progressive tradition.[^28] As one historian noted, Savage "smelt of the church bazaar, not at all of the barricades," describing his moderate, approachable image compared to his more doctrinaire predecessor.[^29] Whereas the hard-line Holland had scared middle-class voters, the gregarious but soft-spoken Savage personified Labour's diluted socialism, or what he called "applied Christianity."[^30]

The 1935 election saw a massive win for the opposition Labour Party, which won fifty-three seats and formed the First Labour Government.[^31] Labour won 45.7% of the popular vote to the governing coalition's 33.5%, and three government ministers were defeated in Hamilton, Tauranga and Waitaki.[^32] There can be little doubt that the Government would have been decisively beaten in any case, but the margin was so great that it may be attributed in some measure to Savage's personal role.[^33] After Labour's landslide victory in the 1935 election, Savage became Prime Minister on December 6, 1935.[^34]

## Major Achievements

### Social Security Act of 1938

The crowning achievement of Savage's government was the Social Security Act of 1938, which established a comprehensive framework for universal health care and pensions, making New Zealand a pioneer in welfare state policies.[^35] The Act combined the introduction of what was intended to be a free-at-the-point-of-use health system with a comprehensive array of welfare benefits.[^36] The government set up this comprehensive welfare state to protect New Zealanders from what many had suffered during the depression, providing universal free health care, maternity care and comprehensive welfare benefits.[^37]

Savage actively campaigned for the bill, describing its objectives in humanitarian terms and as "applied Christianity."[^38] His 1938 speeches to crowds of up to 30,000 were among the most moving and inspiring ever made in a New Zealand election campaign.[^39] Labour fought the 1938 general election on its overall record, but as the campaign developed, two issues became paramount: the introduction of the social security scheme, and the personality of the Prime Minister.[^40] The 1938 election resulted in overwhelming public support, with Labour's share of votes rising from 46 to 56 percent.[^41] His popularity amongst the voting population was so celebrated that he reportedly remarked in disbelief to John A. Lee that "They [the people] think I am God" after Labour's re-election in 1938.[^42]

### State Housing Programme

As a statement of intent, the new Labour government immediately paid a Christmas bonus to the unemployed and those receiving charitable aid, while relief workers were given seven days' annual holiday.[^43] In 1936 there was a landslide of legislation aimed at stimulating the economy, including a programme of state house construction.[^44] The new Labour government drew up plans to use private enterprise to build 5000 state rental houses across New Zealand, hoping to stimulate local industry and provide work for those left jobless by the Great Depression.[^45]

On 18 September 1937, most of the Labour Cabinet helped the first tenants move into 12 Fife Lane in the Wellington suburb of Miramar, with Prime Minister Savage personally carrying a dining table through a cheering throng.[^46] Exemplifying his enthusiasm for his government's policies, Savage personally assisted the family in moving their furniture into the first of the government's 1930s state houses.[^47] At the opening, Savage addressed the crowd, reeling off the impressive statistics of the state housing scheme: 6000 jobs created since March that year, tenders called for 2300 houses in 56 towns and £1.5 million spent.[^48]

### Economic Reforms and Nationalization

The first significant legislative act of the incoming Savage government was the nationalization of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand in 1936, making it a state-controlled central bank.[^49] Union membership became compulsory as part of the government's reforms.[^50] The government also guaranteed prices for dairy produce, providing stability for New Zealand's crucial farming sector.[^51] In 1936, the government decided that broadcasting would be run by the state, passing the Broadcasting Act 1936 and nationalizing commercial broadcasting.[^52]

Much of the 1936 legislation, by increasing community purchasing power, stimulated the economy, thereby creating jobs and, in turn, further demand.[^53] Savage believed that government should give people a hand-up, not a hand-out, and offered hope to people devastated by the Depression.[^54]

### Alliance with the Rātana Movement

Savage helped engineer an historic alliance between the Labour Party and the Rātana Church, which had consulted with his followers over Māori policy.[^55] Rātana favoured the Labour Party because it had consulted his supporters when devising its Māori policy.[^56] The political alliance between Labour and the Rātana movement was cemented at an historic meeting between Tahupōtiki Wiremu Rātana and Prime Minister Savage, ending some discrimination against Māori and giving increased attention to Māori employment, education, health and land settlement.[^57]

Unlike Australia, where the Labor Party basically supported the reigning "White Australia" policy and called for assimilation of the Aborigines, the Savage government recognized Maori identity and sought—and largely achieved—a rapprochement with the Ratana movement, a syncretic religious group that espoused both Christian and indigenous Maori beliefs.[^58] Savage felt that equal opportunity for Māori could best be achieved through a comprehensive welfare system and greater development of Māori land, and under Labour, Māori received – at least in theory – equal access to unemployment benefits and housing finance.[^59] When Labour won its landslide election victory in 1935, the Rātana movement took a second seat, and in 1943, the Rātana–Labour alliance succeeded in capturing all "four quarters" when Tiaki Omana defeated Sir Apirana Ngata in Eastern Maori.[^60]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Foreign Policy Disputes

In 1937, Savage sailed to Britain to attend the coronation of King George VI and the Imperial Conference, where he distinguished himself from his fellow prime ministers by criticising Britain for weakening the League of Nations, damaging the concept of collective security, and failing to adequately consult the dominions on matters of foreign policy and defence.[^61] He referred particularly to Britain's appeasement of Japan over its invasion of Manchuria, of Italy over the conquest of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), and of Germany over that country's rearmament.[^62]

At the conference, Savage criticized Britain's policy of appeasement, saying "You can pay too high a price even for peace."[^63] Subsequently, New Zealand distanced itself from Britain at the League of Nations, opposing Britain's further appeasement of Franco in Spain and its unwillingness to allow the League to take a firm stand against Japan's invasion of China.[^64] In 1938 Savage publicly criticised Britain's acceptance of Hitler's annexation of part of Czechoslovakia, leading to his being condemned by leading New Zealand newspapers such as the New Zealand Herald and Dominion for "this embarrassing and deplorable display of Empire disunity."[^65]

Britain, Australia, Canada and the opposition National Party were critical of Savage for his stance.[^66] The criticism from conservative forces in New Zealand and across the Commonwealth reflected the controversial nature of Savage's willingness to challenge British foreign policy at a time when colonial deference to London was still expected.

### The Lee Affair

The most damaging internal controversy of Savage's leadership was his bitter conflict with John A. Lee, a charismatic Labour MP and left-wing critic. During the selection of his Cabinet in both 1935 and 1938, Prime Minister Savage had ignored Lee's personal appeals for inclusion, thinking him too wild and unconventional.[^67] The largest reason for Lee's exclusion was that Savage personally disliked him, and the two had a history of opposing each other on policy issues, notably Savage's loan proposals; Lee had opposed Savage's selection as leader in 1933.[^68]

Immediately after the 1938 election, at the first Labour caucus on 3 November, Lee moved that caucus elect a new cabinet rather than endorse either the existing one or one nominated by Savage.[^69] After a bitter debate caucus narrowly passed Lee's motion. However, Savage over-ruled the vote and proceeded to inform the press that cabinet would remain unchanged.[^70] In December 1938 the infamous "Lee Letter" appeared, containing many attacks on the financial orthodoxy and over-cautiousness of the Labour leadership.[^71]

Lee gave Savage his opportunity for retaliation by publishing in the left-wing journal Tomorrow an article entitled "Psychopathology in politics"; although it did not name Savage directly, it implied unmistakably that Savage's physical condition had destroyed him mentally.[^72] This controversy occurred during a particularly difficult period, as the Prime Minister's health had begun to deteriorate seriously in mid-1938, but the gravity of his illness was known to few even of his colleagues until he underwent a major operation in August 1939.[^73] Perhaps because he did not know that his condition was incurable, Savage did not resign.[^74]

At the 1940 Labour Party conference, Peter Fraser read a surprise addendum to Savage's report, in which Savage told the delegates that for "about two years my life has been a living hell" because Lee had disloyally and in defiance of earlier conference decisions attacked him.[^75] Following a rancorous deliberation, Lee was expelled from the Labour Party by 546 votes to 344, and a little more than 24 hours later, early on 27 March 1940, Savage died at his home in Wellington.[^76]

### Economic Policy Criticism

Savage's own views on financial questions were vague and many of his public statements would seem to support an approach akin to Social Credit.[^77] However, Savage qualified his more important statements with warnings of the inflationary dangers of the excessive issue of credit and in office he firmly supported the cautious policies of his Minister of Finance.[^78] Savage faced opposition from the Treasury, the New Zealand branch of the British Medical Association, and the National Party regarding his social security schemes.[^79]

There had developed within the Parliamentary Party a monetary reform wing, whose most articulate spokesman was John A. Lee, and as early as 1932 and 1933 there were differences on the relative merits of borrowing or the issue of credit to finance recovery.[^80] Savage's economic thinking was influenced by his belief that the state alone should have the right to issue money and regulate its value and to control credit through a government-directed banking system.[^81]

### Leadership Style Criticisms

Contrary to the prevailing popular image of almost undiluted benevolence, Savage could be willful and arbitrary in his leadership style.[^82] The impetuous Lee burst forth with intemperate public criticism of the Government and, most sharply of all, of Savage himself, revealing tensions in Savage's management of internal party disputes.[^83] Despite these criticisms of his sometimes autocratic tendencies, Savage's popularity with the public remained extraordinarily high throughout his tenure.

## Personal Life

Michael Joseph Savage never married and had no children.[^84] After his mother's death when he was five, he was raised primarily by his sister Rose, whose death in childbirth in 1891 deeply affected him.[^85] Upon arriving in New Zealand, he boarded with Alf and Elizabeth French and their two children, living with the French family until 1939, when he moved to the house Hill Haven, 64–66 Harbour View Road, Northland, Wellington.[^86]

His kindly and genial personality, and his skills as an orator, were largely responsible for ensuring his policies' acceptance.[^87] He could be shrewd, logical, and tough-minded, and he had two priceless gifts for the politician: the ability to take the public's pulse, and to project a personal warmth and friendliness to a mass audience.[^88] Savage's personality provided the public with a sense of kindliness in government.[^89] Savage refused to indulge in recrimination and divisive politics but sought to unite as many people as possible behind a common dream of a better and fairer society.[^90]

Often called "Everybody's Uncle," his genial and charismatic personality, and his skills as an orator, were largely responsible for public acceptance of his government's radical policies.[^91] The iconic 1935 portrait of Savage, taken by Spencer Digby studio in Wellington in March 1936, became a feature in the homes of left-leaning New Zealanders after it was printed in the Auckland Weekly News in 1936.[^92] It is one of New Zealand's most famous photographs, a black and white image of the gently smiling Michael Joseph Savage, and the iconic portrait hung in thousands of homes in the 1930s and 40s.[^93]

Savage's declining health became a major factor in his final years. A week after the Social Security Bill was introduced to Parliament on 12 August 1938, Savage collapsed in Auckland and was diagnosed with cancer of the colon necessitating immediate surgery.[^94] He was informed that any delay could be fatal.[^95] Despite the urgent medical advice, Savage delayed surgery in order to promote the Social Security Bill and campaign for the 1938 election.[^96] Although he realized his medical advisers were probably correct, Savage was reluctant to be incapacitated during the next two months during which the Social Security Bill had to be enacted and a critical election fought against a revitalised opposition.[^97] Savage decided to delay the operation until after the election and in the view of one of his confidants, the Anglican bishop of Wellington, "thereby signed his own death warrant."[^98]

The surgery was eventually performed much later: on 4 August 1939, the day after reading the budget, Savage had the operation he had postponed almost a year before.[^99] When New Zealand declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Savage was recovering from an operation for colon cancer.[^100] By August 1939 Savage was forced to hand over his duties to Peter Fraser, who became acting prime minister.[^101]

## Legacy

Michael Joseph Savage died on 27 March 1940 while serving as New Zealand's 23rd Prime Minister, four days after his 68th birthday.[^102] His state funeral included a Requiem Mass celebrated at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Hill St, Wellington before his body was taken amidst general and public mourning by train to Auckland, with frequent halts to allow local people and dignitaries to pay their last respects; the journey was carried live on the radio.[^103] His body lay in state at Parliament for two days before his funeral cortège, which was more than 1.6 km long, set off for the railway station at 9 a.m. on 30 March.[^104] It was to be the longest funeral procession, and the most striking outpouring of public grief, in New Zealand's history.[^105] Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders paid their respects in Wellington and Auckland and at 20 stops along the main trunk railway line as the body was transported to its final resting place.[^106]

He was initially interred on 31 March 1940 in a temporarily adapted harbour defence gun installation at Bastion Point, then removed to a side chapel of St Patrick's Cathedral in Auckland while a national competition was announced for the design of a monumental tomb.[^107] Savage was entombed in the permanent memorial two years after his death, with the Savage Memorial at Bastion Point erected above the grave, overlooking the Waitemata Harbour.[^108]

Michael Joseph Savage is commonly known as the architect of the New Zealand welfare state and is generally regarded by academics and the general public as one of New Zealand's greatest and most revered prime ministers.[^109] He was probably New Zealand's best-loved prime minister, with his avuncular image hanging in the homes of the Labour faithful for decades.[^110] The achievements of the first Labour government became personified in this modest man, and for years after his death his picture hung on thousands of living-room walls.[^111] He died at the height of his popularity; for decades afterwards, his photograph hung on the wall of thousands of New Zealand homes.[^112]

Savage was awarded the title of "New Zealander of the Century" by The New Zealand Herald in 1999.[^113] His time as Prime Minister helped lay the framework for modern New Zealand politics and helped create the nation's current social welfare system.[^114] However, Savage's image as a Kiwi icon has faded over time due to significant events in New Zealand history such as the Second World War and the economic boom under the National Party in the 1950s and 1960s.[^115]

On March 27, 1940, Savage died at his home in Wellington and was succeeded as prime minister by his deputy Peter Fraser.[^116] Fraser had been a key minister in Savage's government and ensured continuity of Labour's reform agenda through World War II and beyond.[^117]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Historians today would agree almost unanimously that Savage was New Zealand's best loved Prime Minister.[^118] Michael Joseph Savage is considered in present-day New Zealand as the greatest Prime Minister in New Zealand's history.[^119] Barry Gustafson wrote the definitive biography "From the Cradle to the Grave: A Biography of Michael Joseph Savage" (Auckland, NZ, 1986), providing comprehensive scholarly analysis of Savage's life and impact.[^120]

Savage is considered by academics and historians to be one of New Zealand's greatest and most revered prime ministers, with his government's introduction of groundbreaking legislation, including the Social Security Act of 1938, establishing a framework for universal health care and pensions.[^121] The 1938 victory, even greater in terms of real support than that of 1935, was in part a personal tribute to the Prime Minister, and represented the summit of his career.[^122]

Scholars particularly praise Savage's ability to build consensus and unite New Zealanders around a vision of social justice. His refusal to indulge in recrimination and divisive politics, instead seeking to unite as many people as possible behind a common dream of a better and fairer society, is seen as a model of inclusive leadership.[^123] His government's recognition of Māori identity and successful alliance with the Rātana movement contrasts favorably with the assimilationist policies pursued in other British dominions.[^124]

The practical achievements of Savage's government—the Social Security Act, state housing, Reserve Bank nationalization, guaranteed farm prices—created institutional frameworks that shaped New Zealand society for generations.[^125] His championing of the welfare state made New Zealand a pioneer in social policy, influencing progressive governments worldwide.[^126]

### Negative Views

Despite his overwhelming popularity, some historians and political scientists have offered more critical assessments of Savage's leadership. His vague economic thinking and reliance on cautious advisors meant that more radical reforms advocated by figures like John A. Lee were rejected, potentially limiting the transformative impact of the First Labour Government.[^127] Critics argue that Savage's moderate, consensus-seeking approach diluted the socialist objectives that had originally animated the Labour Party.[^128]

The bitter Lee Affair revealed a vindictive streak in Savage's character and raised questions about his tolerance for internal dissent.[^129] Lee's expulsion from the party just hours before Savage's death left a bitter legacy and deprived Labour of one of its most talented and passionate advocates for the working class.[^130] Some scholars argue that Savage's autocratic response to caucus criticism after the 1938 election showed a willingness to override democratic processes when his authority was challenged.[^131]

Conservative historians and National Party supporters criticized Savage's economic interventionism as laying the groundwork for excessive state control and dependence on government.[^132] The nationalization of broadcasting and the Reserve Bank, compulsory unionism, and extensive state housing were seen by critics as undermining free enterprise and individual initiative.[^133] The Treasury and the New Zealand branch of the British Medical Association strongly opposed his social security schemes as financially reckless and economically unsustainable.[^134]

Savage's foreign policy stance, particularly his criticism of British appeasement at the 1937 Imperial Conference, was condemned at the time as an "embarrassing and deplorable display of Empire disunity."[^135] While his warnings about appeasement proved prescient, his public attacks on British policy strained New Zealand's relationship with London and drew criticism from conservative quarters.[^136]

Some revisionist historians argue that Savage's approach to Māori policy, while progressive for its time, still operated within a framework emphasizing "equality of treatment" that failed to adequately recognize tino rangatiratanga (Māori self-determination) and structural inequalities.[^137] The emphasis on developing Māori land and providing equal access to welfare assumed assimilation into Pākehā economic structures rather than supporting distinctively Māori forms of economic and social organization.[^138]
