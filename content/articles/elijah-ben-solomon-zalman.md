## Summary

The Vilna Gaon (Genius of Vilna) was a Lithuanian Jewish Talmudist and scholar who is considered the most important non-Hasidic rabbi of the modern era. He mastered virtually every area of Jewish learning, including Talmud, Kabbalah, mathematics, and astronomy. He fiercely opposed the Hasidic movement, issuing bans of excommunication against them. His methodical approach to Talmud study shaped the Lithuanian yeshiva tradition that persists to this day.
