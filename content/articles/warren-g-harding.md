## Summary

Warren Gamaliel Harding served as the 29th President of the United States from March 4, 1921, until his sudden death on August 2, 1923. A Republican from Ohio, Harding rose from small-town newspaper publisher to the nation's highest office, campaigning on a promise to restore "normalcy" after the tumultuous World War I era and Progressive reforms.[^1] His presidency achieved significant accomplishments including the Washington Naval Conference and pro-business economic policies, yet became synonymous with corruption due to the Teapot Dome scandal and other controversies involving his administration's "Ohio Gang."[^2] Once among America's most popular presidents, Harding's posthumous reputation collapsed dramatically, with historians consistently ranking him among the worst chief executives, though recent scholarship has begun reassessing this harsh judgment.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Warren Gamaliel Harding was born on November 2, 1865, in Blooming Grove, Ohio, the eldest of eight children born to George Tryon Harding and Phoebe Elizabeth Harding.[^4] Nicknamed "Winnie" as a small child, young Warren grew up in modest circumstances in rural Ohio.[^5] His mother Phoebe worked as a state-licensed midwife, while his father Tryon initially farmed and taught school near Mount Gilead before pursuing medicine through apprenticeship, study, and a year of medical school, eventually establishing a small medical practice.[^6]

Early in Warren's childhood, the Harding family relocated to the small town of Caledonia, Ohio, where Dr. Harding established his medical practice.[^7] Warren enjoyed what he would later describe as an idyllic American childhood, growing up in a small town and attending a one-room schoolhouse.[^8] He spent summers at the local creek and performed in the village band, developing the affable personality that would serve him throughout his political career.[^9] During these formative years, Harding discovered his passion for journalism in the office of the Caledonia Argus, the local newspaper of which Dr. Harding was part owner, where the future president served an apprenticeship in printing.[^10]

At the remarkably young age of 14, Harding attended Ohio Central College, where he edited the campus newspaper and became an accomplished public speaker—skills that would prove invaluable in his later political career.[^11] In 1882, at just 16 years of age, he received a Bachelor of Science degree and served as "orator," the political and literary representative of his class at the graduation ceremony.[^12] After graduating from Ohio Central College, Harding made several unsuccessful attempts to study law, teach school, and sell insurance before finding his true calling.[^13] At age 18, he raised $300 in partnership with others to purchase the failing Marion Star, the weakest of the growing city's three papers and its only daily.[^14]

In the summer of 1884, when Harding heard that the Marion Daily Star was up for sheriff's sale, he seized the opportunity despite the paper's well-known record of failure.[^15] Through determination, hard work, and occasionally questionable business tactics—working, stalling, bluffing, withholding payments, borrowing back wages, boasting, and manipulating—he transformed a dying publication into a powerful small-town newspaper.[^16] Within a short time, Harding became the sole owner, acting as both publisher and editor, beginning a thirty-nine-year career as a newspaperman that would shape his thinking and communication style throughout his life.[^17]

## Rise to Power

Warren Harding's ascent from small-town newspaper publisher to United States Senator and ultimately the presidency exemplified the classic American political trajectory of the early 20th century. His political career began in earnest in 1899 when he won a seat as State Senator in the Ohio Legislature, where he would serve two terms.[^18] Harding entered his four years as a state senator as a political unknown but emerged as one of the most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party, demonstrating his natural gift for building relationships and consensus.[^19]

As an ardent Republican, Harding continued to advance in Ohio politics, and in 1903 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Ohio.[^20] He served in that capacity for two years before returning to focus on his newspaper business, demonstrating a pattern of alternating between politics and journalism that characterized his early career.[^21] In 1910, Harding made an unsuccessful bid for the Ohio governorship, suffering a defeat that might have ended a less resilient politician's career.[^22]

Undaunted by this setback and encouraged by friends and colleagues, Harding launched a campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate four years later.[^23] This time he succeeded, making history by becoming Ohio's first senator elected by direct vote of the citizens following the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution.[^24] In 1914, Harding was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he remained until his presidential inauguration in 1921.[^25]

Harding's Senate career was characterized by congeniality rather than legislative accomplishment. The affable senator compiled an unexceptional legislative record but enjoyed the camaraderie and friendship of senators on both sides of the aisle.[^26] While he supported high protective tariffs and opposed President Woodrow Wilson's plan for the League of Nations, Harding was generally a conciliator who took few strong stands on controversial issues.[^27] His Senate tenure was notable more for his personal charm and party loyalty than for groundbreaking legislation or policy initiatives, a pattern that would continue into his presidency.

The 1920 Republican convention would prove to be Harding's breakthrough moment on the national stage. When the convention deadlocked after several rounds of balloting, party leaders—supposedly in the now-legendary "smoke-filled room" at the Blackstone Hotel in Chicago—turned to the genial Ohio senator as a compromise candidate.[^28] The night of June 11–12, 1920, became famous in political history as party elders met in Room 404 of the Blackstone Hotel.[^29] After a nightlong session, these Republican leaders tentatively concluded that Harding was the best possible compromise candidate who could unite the fractious party.[^30] When the leading candidates could not garner a majority and the convention deadlocked, support for Harding increased steadily, and he was nominated on the tenth ballot.[^31]

## Major Achievements

Despite his tarnished posthumous reputation, Warren G. Harding's presidency produced several significant accomplishments that historians increasingly recognize as substantial contributions to American governance and international relations.

### The Washington Naval Conference

The Washington Naval Disarmament Conference of 1921-1922 stands as the most important achievement of the Harding presidency.[^32] The United States hosted this groundbreaking international gathering, and under Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes' leadership, the conference succeeded in persuading the world's major powers to agree to halt the arms race in production of large naval vessels.[^33] The conference resulted in the signing of several treaties that sought to limit naval armaments, including the Five-Power Treaty, which established a ratio for capital ship tonnage among the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy.[^34] In addition to establishing limits on naval armaments, the conference also banned the use of poison gas and produced several treaties with the objective of easing tensions in Asia.[^35] This massive diplomatic effort represented a genuine contribution to international peace and stability during the interwar period.

### Economic Policies and Fiscal Reform

Harding's administration implemented a comprehensive pro-business conservative agenda that significantly reshaped the American economy. In 1921, Congress established a federal budget system through the Budget and Accounting Act, which created the Bureau of the Budget and the General Accounting Office under the Treasury Department—a fundamental reform that brought systematic organization to federal finances for the first time.[^36] Harding pushed for and signed the Revenue Act of 1921, which significantly reduced wartime tax rates, cutting the top individual income tax rate from 73% to 58% and reducing corporate taxes.[^37] These tax cuts, implemented by Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, were designed to stimulate economic growth and encourage private investment.

The Harding administration eliminated wartime economic controls and slashed taxes, established the new federal budget system, restored high protective tariffs through the Fordney-McCumber Tariff Act, and imposed tight limitations upon immigration.[^38] Harding encouraged federal regulatory agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice Department, and the Interstate Commerce Commission to cooperate with corporations rather than regulate them aggressively or instigate antimonopoly actions against them.[^39] This approach of regulatory cooperation with business rather than confrontation marked a dramatic shift from the Progressive Era's more interventionist philosophy.

### Immigration Restriction

On May 19, 1921, President Harding signed the Emergency Quota Act, introducing annual immigrant nationality quotas for the first time in American history.[^40] The law restricted the number of immigrants admitted from any country annually to 3% of the number of residents from that country living in the United States as of the 1910 Census.[^41] The resulting legislation allowed for 350,000 entrances to the United States per year, with quota allocations meaning that for European countries, 55% of quota allotments went to northern and western Europe.[^42] Based on the new formula, the number of new immigrants admitted fell dramatically from 805,228 in 1920 to 309,556 in 1921–22.[^43] While controversial and discriminatory by modern standards, this represented a major policy shift responding to public sentiment of the era.

### Veterans' Affairs and Social Programs

Harding established the Veterans' Bureau in 1921, a precursor to today's Department of Veterans Affairs, responsible for providing medical care, rehabilitation, and financial assistance to the thousands of veterans returning from World War I.[^44] Additionally, Harding signed the Sheppard-Towner Maternity and Infancy Act, granting matching federal funds to states for maternal and child care, representing an early federal commitment to public health.[^45]

### Cabinet Appointments

Harding appointed several exceptionally capable individuals to his cabinet, including Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover, Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes, and Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon—three appointments generally considered among Harding's most successful cabinet choices.[^46] He shocked many old-guard supporters by naming Charles Evans Hughes, a proponent of the League of Nations, as his Secretary of State, recognizing Hughes as having one of the "finest minds in the country."[^47] Similarly, his appointment of Herbert Hoover as Secretary of Commerce, despite conservative Republicans' objections, demonstrated Harding's willingness to select talented individuals regardless of factional politics.[^48]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Warren G. Harding's presidency became synonymous with corruption and scandal, overshadowing his legitimate accomplishments and devastating his historical reputation. The scandals that emerged during and after his administration represented some of the most serious cases of governmental corruption in American history prior to Watergate.

### The Teapot Dome Scandal

The Teapot Dome scandal stands as the defining controversy of the Harding era and remains one of the most notorious cases of governmental corruption in American history. On April 7, 1922, Harding's Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall, secretly leased oil reserves at Teapot Dome in Wyoming to Harry Sinclair's Mammoth Oil Company.[^49] Several weeks later, Fall leased additional reserves at Elk Hills in California to Edward Doheny of the Pan American Petroleum and Transport Company.[^50] These petroleum reserves had been specifically designated for the U.S. Navy, and Fall leased them to private oil companies at low rates without competitive bidding.[^51]

The deals were conducted in secret, and Fall was later convicted of accepting a $100,000 bribe—becoming the first and only cabinet officer ever to be found guilty of a crime committed while in office and sentenced to prison.[^52] Convicted of accepting bribes from the oil companies, Fall became the first presidential cabinet member to go to prison, though remarkably, no one was convicted of paying the bribes.[^53] In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that the oil leases had been corruptly obtained and invalidated the Elk Hills lease in February 1927 and the Teapot Dome lease in October.[^54] Before the Watergate scandal, Teapot Dome was widely regarded as the "greatest and most sensational scandal in the history of American politics."[^55]

### The Ohio Gang

Beyond the Teapot Dome affair, multiple other scandals tarnished the Harding administration, many involving the so-called "Ohio Gang"—a group of politicians who achieved high office during Harding's presidency and betrayed the public trust through corruption.[^56] After winning the election, Harding appointed many of his allies and campaign contributors to powerful political positions controlling vast amounts of government money and resources.[^57]

Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty, Harding's longtime campaign manager, was accused of selling government supplies of alcohol during Prohibition and engaging in various corrupt practices.[^58] When Daugherty refused to open Justice Department files to a congressional committee investigating charges of crime by Harding's associates, he was dismissed by President Calvin Coolidge after Harding's death.[^59] In 1927, Daugherty twice went to trial on charges of graft and fraud from his actions as Attorney General, though both trials ended in hung juries.[^60]

### The Veterans Bureau Scandal

Charles Forbes, director of the newly established Veterans' Bureau and a Harding appointee, was accused of accepting kickbacks from contractors building veterans' hospitals and illegally selling surplus medical supplies.[^61] Forbes resigned in February 1923 after an irate Harding reportedly grabbed him by the throat when he learned about the charges.[^62] A Senate investigation in 1924 found that Forbes and his associates stole more than $200 million (nearly $2.8 billion in current dollars) from the bureau meant to serve wounded World War I veterans.[^63] Forbes was eventually sentenced to two years in prison for fraud, conspiracy, and bribery.[^64]

### Harding's Responsibility and Awareness

Warren G. Harding was not personally implicated in the Teapot Dome affair or most other scandals that tarnished his administration, but historians note he was aware of the corrupt behavior of the "Ohio Gang" and failed to expose it or take decisive action.[^65] Most historians conclude that Harding's own lack of vision and his poor sense of priorities in appointments positioned him poorly for effective oversight of his administration.[^66] Some historians have argued that had Harding lived longer, he would have faced impeachment over the scandals that emerged after his death.[^67] The Teapot Dome scandal largely fell out of immediate public attention after Harding died unexpectedly from a heart attack on August 2, 1923, though it would later reemerge to destroy his reputation.[^68]

## Personal Life

Warren G. Harding's personal life was marked by a complex marriage, multiple extramarital affairs, and a gregarious personality that made him popular among peers even as he struggled with personal discipline and judgment.

### Marriage to Florence Harding

On July 8, 1891, Warren Harding, aged twenty-five, married Florence "Flossie" Mabel Kling DeWolf, a local divorcée five years his senior, at their new home on Mount Vernon Avenue in Marion, in a Queen Anne style house they had designed together.[^69] Their marriage produced no children, though Florence had a son from her prior marriage.[^70] Harding affectionately called his wife "the Duchess," while she called him "Sonny."[^71]

Florence became deeply involved in her husband's career, both at the Marion Star newspaper and after he entered politics.[^72] She helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management and business acumen, often handling circulation and business operations while Warren focused on editorial content and community relationships.[^73] Florence's role in Harding's political rise was substantial, though their marriage was strained by his repeated infidelities.

### The Carrie Phillips Affair

Harding's affair with Carrie Phillips, wife of his longtime friend James Phillips, ran for more than fifteen years, beginning in Marion, Ohio, in 1905.[^74] Phillips, described as a tall, attractive woman ten years younger than Harding, became intimately involved with the senator despite both being married.[^75] The relationship became politically dangerous when Phillips, who harbored pro-German sympathies, tried to blackmail Harding into voting against a declaration of war on Germany during World War I.[^76]

When Harding secured the Republican presidential nomination in 1920, the affair threatened to derail his campaign. The Republican National Committee took extraordinary measures to suppress the scandal, bribing Mr. and Mrs. Phillips with a free, slow trip to Japan, $20,000 in cash, and the promise of monthly payments to keep them quiet and out of the country during the election.[^77] The affair remained largely secret during Harding's lifetime and for decades afterward.

### The Nan Britton Affair and Illegitimate Child

Even while conducting his affair with Carrie Phillips, Harding was simultaneously involved with Nan Britton, a pretty blonde thirty years younger than himself, with their affair beginning in 1917.[^78] Nan gave birth to a baby girl on October 22, 1919, named Elizabeth Ann Christian.[^79] Harding never publicly acknowledged the child and never saw her, but he made generous child support payments that were hand-delivered by the Secret Service.[^80]

The affair and Harding's paternity remained disputed for decades, with the Harding family denying the relationship. However, in 2015, Harding's paternity was finally confirmed through DNA testing, providing definitive proof of the relationship and the illegitimate child nearly a century after the affair.[^81] This revelation, along with the Carrie Phillips affair, contributed significantly to the erosion of Harding's reputation, revealing a pattern of personal misconduct that paralleled the corruption in his administration.

### Personality and Character

Contemporary accounts describe Harding as genial, affable, and genuinely likable—qualities that served him well in politics but perhaps contributed to his inability to say no to friends and political allies who took advantage of his trust. His newspaper career shaped his thinking as someone who sought to balance all facets of an issue and examine facts while weighing effects on constituents, but this same tendency toward consensus and accommodation made him vulnerable to manipulation by less scrupulous associates.[^82]

## Legacy

Warren G. Harding's legacy presents one of the most dramatic reversals in presidential reputation in American history. He died as one of the most popular presidents in the nation's history, yet within a few years became synonymous with corruption and incompetence, a reputation that has persisted for a century despite recent scholarly reassessment.

### The Collapse of Reputation

At the time of his death in 1923, Warren G. Harding enjoyed widespread popularity with the American people.[^83] Some contemporary estimates suggested he may have been the most popular president since Abraham Lincoln.[^84] Even while the press eulogized him as a "man of peace," "an ideal American," and "the greatest commoner since Lincoln," events were in motion that would almost completely destroy his reputation.[^85]

The subsequent exposure of the Teapot Dome scandal and other corruption involving his cabinet members eroded his popular regard, as did later revelations of several extramarital affairs.[^86] By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the scandals were fully public, and the Harding administration became a byword for corruption in the public's view.[^87] Progressive authors in the 1920s and 1930s played a significant role in "destroying" Harding's reputation, creating what some scholars describe as a great disparity between scholarly judgment and objective measures of presidential success.[^88]

### Historical Rankings

Harding has been traditionally ranked as one of the worst American presidents in scholarly assessments.[^89] In a 1948 poll conducted by Harvard University historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr., Harding was ranked last among the 29 presidents considered.[^90] Through seven total Schlesinger surveys, Harding was ranked last every time.[^91] Multiple subsequent presidential rankings have consistently placed Harding in the bottom five, along with Andrew Johnson, James Buchanan, and Franklin Pierce.[^92]

Historians assessing the Harding presidency have traditionally focused on its scandals to the neglect of its progress on certain policy areas, and his tarnished reputation reflects this emphasis on corruption rather than accomplishment.[^93] Most historians rank Harding among the worst of all American presidents, citing his lack of vision and poor sense of priorities in appointments.[^94]

### Recent Scholarly Reassessment

In recent decades, however, many historians have begun to fundamentally reassess the conventional views of Harding's historical record in office.[^95] Various historians have defended Harding, with many arguing that he was merely below average rather than a total failure.[^96] Some revisionists now see him as an important transitional figure whose easy-going ways helped bridge the gap between Wilsonian idealism and the business prosperity of the Coolidge and Hoover years.[^97]

Recent scholarship has highlighted aspects of Harding's presidency that deserve more credit, including his release of political prisoners jailed during the Wilson administration's wartime crackdown on dissent, his restoration of free speech protections, his progressive views on race relations, and his prosperity-promoting economic policies that helped launch the boom of the 1920s.[^98] Defenders argue that Harding's reputation was unjustly destroyed by his association with corrupt subordinates rather than his own actions, and that his genuine accomplishments in foreign policy, economic management, and civil liberties have been unfairly overshadowed.[^99]

### The Harding Paradox

The lasting legacy of Warren G. Harding remains paradoxical: a president who achieved meaningful accomplishments in arms control, economic policy, and governmental reform, yet whose name became synonymous with corruption due to the actions of subordinates he failed to control. Whether future scholarship will continue rehabilitating his reputation or whether he will remain firmly among the failed presidents remains an open question in American historical memory.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Recent historical scholarship has identified several aspects of Warren G. Harding's presidency worthy of rehabilitation and positive recognition. Some historians argue that Harding deserves credit as an important transitional figure whose easy-going ways helped bridge the gap between Wilsonian idealism and the business prosperity of the Coolidge and Hoover years that defined the 1920s.[^100] This perspective emphasizes Harding's role in moving the nation away from wartime mobilization and Progressive Era activism toward a more limited government approach that many Americans desired after World War I.

Harding is increasingly given credit for his progressive views on race and civil rights, particularly his landmark Birmingham speech of October 26, 1921, in which he spoke to a segregated audience about racial equality.[^101] This speech is often identified as the first time a sitting U.S. president condemned lynching in such explicit terms, though it actually represented a much broader discussion of racism and race relations.[^102] W.E.B. DuBois, the prominent African American intellectual and civil rights leader, said of the speech: "In this the president made a braver, clearer utterance than Theodore Roosevelt ever dared to make or than William Taft or William McKinley ever dreamed of."[^103] Harding's support for the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, though ultimately unsuccessful in passage, demonstrated moral courage in addressing racial violence.[^104]

Defenders of Harding's legacy point to his accomplishments in releasing political prisoners who had been jailed during the Wilson administration's wartime crackdown on dissent, his restoration of free speech protections after wartime restrictions, and his prosperity-promoting economic policies.[^105] The Washington Naval Conference stands as a genuine diplomatic achievement that promoted international peace and arms limitation during a critical period.[^106] Some scholars argue that Harding's reputation was destroyed by progressive authors with ideological motivations, leaving a great disparity between harsh scholarly judgment and more objective measures of presidential success.[^107]

### Negative Views

The weight of historical scholarship remains decidedly negative in its assessment of Warren G. Harding's presidency. Critics emphasize that while Harding may not have been personally corrupt, his failure to detect, prevent, or punish the corruption of his subordinates represents a fundamental failure of presidential leadership.[^108] The Teapot Dome scandal and the broader pattern of corruption involving the Ohio Gang revealed a president who either could not or would not exercise adequate oversight of his own administration.[^109]

Historians critical of Harding note that his own lack of vision and poor sense of priorities in making appointments positioned him for failure from the beginning.[^110] His tendency to appoint political cronies and campaign contributors to positions of significant responsibility, rather than selecting individuals based solely on competence and integrity, created the conditions for widespread corruption.[^111] When confronted with evidence of wrongdoing, Harding reportedly expressed anguish but failed to take decisive action, suggesting a fundamental weakness in character and leadership.[^112]

The negative assessment extends beyond corruption to policy substance. Critics argue that Harding's pro-business policies, high protective tariffs, and restrictive immigration quotas served narrow interests rather than the broader public good.[^113] His opposition to the League of Nations, while popular domestically, may have represented a missed opportunity for American leadership in preventing future conflicts.[^114] His "return to normalcy" slogan and governing philosophy are characterized by critics as representing intellectual laziness rather than thoughtful conservatism, a retreat from Progressive Era reforms that had addressed genuine social problems.[^115]

The revelations of multiple extramarital affairs, including an illegitimate child, reinforced the image of a president lacking in moral character and personal discipline.[^116] Scholarly critics maintain that Harding's consistent ranking among the worst presidents reflects legitimate historical judgment rather than unfair bias, based on his administration's corruption, his policy failures, and his fundamental unsuitability for the highest office.[^117] Before Watergate, Teapot Dome represented the gold standard of governmental scandal, and Harding's name remained permanently attached to this symbol of corruption.[^118]
