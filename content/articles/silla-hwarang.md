## Summary

The Hwarang (화랑, literally "Flowering Knights" or "Flower Boys") was a state-sponsored organization for the education of elite young males in the ancient kingdom of Silla, Korea, formally established during the reign of King Jinheung (540-576 CE), with the exact founding date debated between 540 and 576 CE.[^1][^2] This prestigious institution trained aristocratic youth in academic and martial skills, Buddhist and Confucian teachings, music, poetry, and ethics, producing many of Silla's most important generals and administrators who played instrumental roles in the unification of the Korean Peninsula in 668 CE.[^3][^4] The Hwarang followed the "Five Commandments for Secular Life" taught by Buddhist monk Won'gwang, which emphasized loyalty to the sovereign, filial piety, trustworthiness among friends, courage in battle, and discretion in taking life.[^5][^6] After the unification period, the organization lost its military significance and prestige during peacetime, eventually being officially disbanded during the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910), though its legacy continues to influence Korean martial arts and cultural identity today.[^7][^8]

## Early Origins and Formation

### The Wonhwa Predecessors

According to the historical chronicles Samguk Sagi (1145) and Samguk Yusa (c. 1285), the Hwarang were preceded by two groups of women called Wonhwa ("original flowers").[^9][^10] During King Jinheung's reign, approximately 300 young men gathered around two beautiful women, Nammo and Junjeong, who were selected for their beauty and studied filial and fraternal piety, loyalty, and sincerity.[^11] However, this experiment ended in disaster when Nammo and Junjeong became jealous rivals, culminating in Junjeong murdering Nammo, which led to the throne disbanding the Wonhwa organization entirely.[^12][^13]

### Establishment Under King Jinheung

Following the Wonhwa's dissolution, the Silla king issued a new decree, selecting boys from noble families who possessed good morals and renamed them Hwarang.[^14] The foundation of the Hwarang system originated from the mid-6th century during King Jinheung's era, though the exact establishment date remains ambiguous—Samguk Sagi reports 576 CE, while Tongguk t'onggam reports 540 CE, and Sadaham is already recorded as a Hwarang in 562 CE according to Samguk Sagi yeoljeon.[^15][^16] King Jinheung first selected virtuous young men from noble families, adorned them, and named them Hwarang, with Seolwonrang being among the first appointed Gukseon (National Immortal) leaders.[^17][^18] In 576 CE, the year King Jinheung died at age 51, the Hwarang was implemented as an official arm of Silla's military.[^19]

### Original Purpose and Selection

The true purpose of this state-sponsored system was likely to enable the ruling class to select the most talented youths and earmark them for future positions within the state apparatus.[^20] Only sons of the aristocracy were eligible to join, specifically those from the true bone (chin'gol) class of Silla's rigid bone-rank social hierarchy system.[^21][^22] The establishment of Hwarang took place in the context of tightening central state control, serving as a complement to the golpum (bone-rank) system and a symbol of harmony and compromise between the king and the aristocracy.[^23] By the seventh century, the organization had grown greatly in prestige and numbered several hundred bands, each consisting of a few hundred youths.[^24]

---

## Organizational Structure and Leadership

### Hierarchy and Ranks

The Hwarang organization featured a sophisticated hierarchical structure. Each group was usually led by a youth of aristocratic standing, with the state appointing a high-ranking official to oversee the entire organization.[^25] The leader of a single group held the prestigious title of Gukseon or "National Immortal," selected exclusively from the true bone (chingol) class of Silla's rigid social hierarchy.[^26][^27] Some scholars view "Hwarang" and "Gukseon" as synonymous terms, while others interpret Gukseon as the supreme leader among several Hwarang who each led their own groups of followers called Nangdo.[^28]

### Notable Early Leaders

The Hwarang Segi manuscript extract includes biographies of fifteen pungwolju (leaders) of the Hwarang, including Wihwarang, Mijinbu, Morang, Ihwarang, Sadaham, Sejong, Seolwonrang, Munno, Biborang, Miseng, Hajong, Bori, and Yongchun.[^29] Sadaham stands as one of the most documented early Hwarang leaders—he became a Hwarang at fifteen years old under King Chinhung, when his followers numbered more than a thousand.[^30] During military campaigns, Sadaham pleaded with the king to lead the first attack, and was commissioned as a commander, becoming the first to breach the enemy gate and bringing the war to an early conclusion.[^31] Sadaham also exemplified the deep bonds between Hwarang members when he pledged death-companionship with Mugwanrang, later grieving himself to death when his companion died.[^32]

### State Oversight

The state maintained direct control over the Hwarang through appointed high-ranking officials who oversaw the organization's activities, ensuring that the elite youth training aligned with governmental objectives of producing capable administrators and military leaders for the kingdom.[^33]

## Comprehensive Training and Education

### Military and Physical Training

The Hwarang in the later 6th and 7th centuries trained in extensive martial skills including horsemanship, swordsmanship, archery, javelin and stone throwing, polo, and ladder-climbing.[^34][^35] This rigorous physical education prepared them for their future roles as military commanders and warriors. The famed Hwarang underwent training in martial arts that blended physical discipline with ethical cultivation, becoming a model for later Korean military systems.[^36]

### Academic and Cultural Studies

The Hwarang received a comprehensive education far beyond military training. During ancient times in the kingdom of Silla, these elite young males selected from noble families were taught literature, dance, poetry, music, horsemanship, philosophy, science, and the art of war.[^37] The Samguk Yusa records that Hwarang members learned the Five Cardinal Confucian Virtues, the Six Arts, the Three Scholarly Occupations, and the Six Ways of Government Service.[^38] They were highly literate and composed songs and performed dancing, also involving themselves in intellectual and political affairs.[^39]

### Religious and Philosophical Education

The religious component of Hwarang education incorporated a syncretic mix of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism, with probable elements of shamanism which had long been practiced in the Korean peninsula.[^40][^41] A close relationship existed between the Hwarang and Buddhism because it was accepted as a state religion by the royalty and aristocrats within the Silla Kingdom, and Buddhist monks were often mentors for the Hwarang in both physical and spiritual ways.[^42][^43] There were educational institutions as well as social clubs where members gathered for all aspects of study, originally for arts and culture as well as religious teachings stemming mainly from Korean Buddhism.[^44]

### Sacred Mountain Excursions

The Hwarang trained in ethics, music, and nature excursions, with training typically lasting three years.[^45] The boys often met in places of great natural beauty, especially sacred mountains and rivers, where they sang and danced with their faces painted and wore jewelled shoes.[^46] They traveled to specific sacred sites such as Mt. Namsan, Mt. Geumgang, and Mt. Jiri to cultivate patriotism and moral discipline, while also studying geography.[^47] Both the Buddhist monks and the Hwarang would go on journeys to famous mountains to heighten their training and would seek encounters with supernatural beings for protection and prosperity of the Silla Kingdom, reflecting shamanistic beliefs that divine will, especially that of mountain spirits, governed human and national destiny.[^48][^49]

## The Five Commandments: Ethical Code

### Won'gwang and the Five Precepts

Won'gwang (541-630 CE) was a renowned Buddhist monk, scholar, and teacher of the Silla kingdom during the reign of King Jinpyeong.[^50] In 589 CE, Won'gwang went to Sui China, where for eleven years he was educated in the major texts of both Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism, returning to Silla in 600 CE.[^51] Two Hwarang youths, Gwisan and Chwihang, approached the monk Won'gwang seeking spiritual guidance, saying "We are ignorant and without knowledge. Please give us a maxim which will serve to instruct us for the rest of our lives."[^52] Won'gwang replied by composing the Sesok-ogye ("Five Commandments for Secular Life").[^53]

### The Five Commandments

The Five Precepts for Secular Life which became the ethical foundation that the Hwarang embraced were:[^54][^55][^56]

1. **Show allegiance to one's sovereign** - Emphasizing loyalty to the king and state
2. **Treat one's parents with respect and devotion** - Filial piety as a Confucian virtue
3. **Exhibit trust and sincerity amongst friends** - Brotherhood and trustworthiness
4. **Never retreat in battle** - Courage and fearlessness in military conflict
5. **Exercise discretion when taking a life** - Ethical restraint and avoiding indiscriminate killing

These five commandments derived from Confucian and Buddhist teachings and served as moral guideposts for the Buddhist layperson, representing an interesting fusion of Buddhist beliefs and the strong sense of patriotism that characterized Silla Buddhism.[^57][^58] The guiding principle in the education of the Hwarang can be seen in these commandments, which taught loyal service to the king, filial piety, faithfulness to friends, courage in battle, and the evil of indiscriminate killing.[^59] These commandments and teachings of Won'gwang were followed by the Hwarang to protect the Silla Kingdom from rival kingdoms and helped unify the nation of Ancient Korea.[^60]

## Role in the Unification of the Three Kingdoms

### Military Contributions

The Hwarang warriors were said to have played an instrumental role in Silla's conquest of the rest of the Korean Peninsula and in the establishment of the Unified Silla dynasty (668-935 CE).[^61] Although some historians believe that the Hwarang played a significant part in the unification of the Three Kingdoms, some historians remain unclear about the precise role that the Hwarang played in the unification.[^62] The majority of the state's most important politicians and administrators were educated in the Hwarang, providing Silla with a steady stream of capable leaders.[^63]

### Kim Yu-sin: The Most Famous Hwarang

Kim Yu-sin (595-673 CE) was a Korean military general and politician in 7th-century Silla who became the most famous of all Hwarang members.[^64][^65] He was born in Manno county in 595 CE, became a Hwarang warrior at just 15 years old, and was an accomplished swordsman and a Gukseon (Hwarang leader) by the time he was 18 years old.[^66] Kim Yu-sin led the unification of the Korean Peninsula by Silla under the reign of King Muyeol and King Munmu, and is regarded as the driving force in the unification of the Korean Peninsula.[^67][^68] Throughout his life, Kim Yu-sin felt that Baekje, Goguryeo, and Silla should not be separate countries but rather united as one.[^69]

### Major Military Victories

Silla troops led by Kim Yu-sin defeated an elite force of Baekje troops commanded by Gyebaek in the pivotal Battle of Hwangsanbeol in 660 CE.[^70] In 661 CE they attacked the seemingly impregnable Goguryeo kingdom but were repelled; however, in 667 CE another offensive was launched which finally destroyed Goguryeo in 668 CE.[^71] In 668 CE, King Munmu bestowed upon Kim Yu-sin the honorary title of Taedaegakgan, and he reportedly received a village of over 500 households, with 142 separate horse farms spread throughout the kingdom granted to him in 669 CE.[^72] Kim Yu-sin lived to the age of 79 and is considered to be one of the most famous generals and masters of Korean swords in Korean history.[^73]

### Kwanchang's Heroic Sacrifice

Kwanchang represents another famous Hwarang who gave his life bravely in battle against the Baekje kingdom in 660 CE.[^74] During the Battle of Hwangsanbeol, General Kim Pumil sent his young son and Hwarang, Gwanchang (age 16), to single-handedly engage the enemy.[^75][^76] Gwanchang was captured by the Baekje forces at first and was released by enemy general Gyebaek out of respect for his courage.[^77] The young Hwarang then returned to the Silla base only to once again charge out at the enemy; Gyebaek captured him once more, and because he respected his young enemy, he executed Gwanchang and sent his body to the Silla base.[^78] Through Kwanchang's martyrdom, the Silla forces renewed their morale and Kim Yu-sin released a full attack on the dwindling Baekje forces, exemplifying the Hwarang code of conduct which emphasized loyalty to the state and fearlessness in battle.[^79][^80]

---

## International Relations and Cultural Exchange

### Alliance with Tang China

The strategic alliance Silla formed with Tang China played a pivotal role in transforming its fortunes, allowing Silla to bolster its military against Goguryeo and Baekje.[^81] The Tang Dynasty's culture, government systems, and military practices exerted a significant influence on Korean kingdoms, and Korean leaders frequently sought to emulate the more advanced Chinese civilization in various aspects, including governance and cultural practices.[^82]

### Diplomatic and Economic Exchange

The Tang court and Xinluo (Silla) established a friendly relationship, and among other foreign countries having diplomatic relations with China, Xinluo had the most students studying in Chang'an and had the largest trade volume with China.[^83] Both countries benefited from cultural exchanges, with Tang envoys conveying silk, porcelain, Chinese tea and engraving typography to Xinluo, while Xinluo's envoys brought medicinal materials, handicraft articles, Korean ginseng and Korean music to China.[^84]

### Chinese Observations of the Hwarang

A Chinese official recorded that Silla chose fair sons from noble families, adorned them with cosmetics and fine clothes, and called them Hwarang.[^85] A Tang envoy visiting in 768 CE noted that among the noble sons, those of beautiful appearance were chosen and called Hwarang, and all people of the country revered them.[^86] These observations from Chinese officials provide valuable external corroboration of the Hwarang's existence and their distinctive cultural practices.

---

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Historiographical Debates on Function

Whilst some are of the opinion that the Hwarang served a purely military role in the society of Silla, others argue that it had a primarily religious function instead.[^87] Many see the Hwarang as similar to European knighthood or Japanese samurai, but it's a misconception to view them as purely a military organization.[^88] Despite having represented a "noble flag" of Korean nationalism in the course of the twentieth century, Hwarang may actually have been a para-religious order composed of bands of commoners or even low-born subjects acting under the command of aristocratic leaders, though this remains contested.[^89]

### Same-Sex Relationships and Male Bonding

Hwarang was the most overt form of same-sex relationships in ancient Korea.[^90] The sexual prowess of the Hwarang were recorded in the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms, through pieces of Silla poetry such as Changipalang-ga, Mojugjilang-ga, and Ch'oyong-ga.[^91] The "sister" referred to in some texts is in fact a Hwarang boy who adopted a passive role in homosexual acts.[^92] Before the arrival of the Joseon Dynasty in the 14th century and its elevation of Confucian principles, Korea was relatively tolerant of same-sex relationships, with elite warriors during the Silla Kingdom known as Hwarang engaged in homosexual behavior.[^93] The famous soldiers of the Silla Dynasty known as the Hwarang were originally recruited by King Jinheung to wear dresses and serve in his court as Hwanang ("flower girls"), and evolved into an order of fighting men known for their cosmetic-enhanced beauty.[^94]

### The Hwarang Segi Manuscript Controversy

The Hwarang Segi manuscripts, made public in 1989 and 1995, were purportedly discovered and copied by Bak Chang-hwa who was working in Japan for the Japanese government between 1933 and 1945.[^95] Korean scholars are deeply divided on the issue of authenticity because the manuscripts are fundamentally different than the later Goryeo period sources.[^96] Scholar Richard McBride regards it as a forgery, and his study evaluates the authenticity of the Hwarang Segi manuscripts by placing them within the larger context of Pak Ch'anghwa's other fictional writings on Silla, providing strong evidence that Pak composed the Hwarang Segi as historical fiction.[^97][^98]

### Martial Arts Appropriation

There are many martial arts and practitioners who make unfounded claims about their art and its relationship with the ancient Hwarang system, arising from inaccurate historical accounts and in some cases mere fabrications.[^99] There are claims that Korean Tae Kwon Do came from the Silla Hwarang, while other Tae Kwon Do practitioners say that their art came from the ancient Koguryo kingdom, though these claims often lack historical substantiation.[^100]

### Limited Archaeological Evidence

Epigraphic records from Silla, such as inscriptions on bronze bells and stone monuments, reference military exploits and collective youth contributions to campaigns but rarely invoke "Hwarang" by name, and no artifacts directly labeled as Hwarang have been discovered.[^101] Surviving steles and rock carvings from the 6th-8th centuries allude to "rang" (youth) formations in border defenses, but provide no dedicated Hwarang epigraphy to verify organizational roles.[^102] The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok, cast in 771 CE, bears over 1,000 characters detailing royal merits and foundry details, yet omits specific mention of Hwarang groups despite the era's documented military expansions.[^103]

---

## Decline and Dissolution

### Loss of Military Significance

After establishing a Unified Silla through the conquest of Baekje and Goguryeo, followed by the Silla-Tang War and reestablishing relations with the Tang dynasty, the Hwarang lost much of their influence and prestige during peacetime.[^104] This group was reduced to a social club for Silla's elite through various names, no longer serving the vital military and political recruitment function that had characterized their golden age.[^105]

### Official Disbandment

The Hwarang would eventually disappear after the fall of Silla, but they lasted through the Koryŏ dynasty until they officially disbanded at the beginning of the Joseon dynasty (1392-1910).[^106] More specifically, the prominence of the Hwarangdo began to decline with the disintegration of Silla rule, and the Hwarang were officially disbanded during the Chosŏn (Yi) dynasty.[^107]

### Transformation of Meaning

Following the fall of Silla, the term "Hwarang" survived but changed in meaning dramatically.[^108] During the Joseon Dynasty, "Hwarang" came to mean a male shaman, representing a complete departure from its original aristocratic warrior-scholar connotation.[^109] In one 16th-century text, the term Hwarang is even referred to as a male prostitute, demonstrating the degradation of the term's prestige over the centuries.[^110]

---

## Historical Sources and Documentation

### Primary Historical Chronicles

Information on the Hwarang is mainly found in the historiographical works Samguk Sagi (1145) and Samguk Yusa (c. 1285), and the partially extant Haedong Goseungjeon (1215), which is a compilation of biographies of famous monks.[^111] All three of these works cite primary sources no longer existent, including a memorial stele to Nallang by the 9th-10th century Silla scholar Ch'oe Ch'i-wŏn; an early Tang account of Silla titled the Xinluo Guoji by the Tang official Ling Hucheng; and Hwarang Segi (Chronicle of the Hwarang) by Kim Taemun, compiled in the early eighth century.[^112]

### The Samguk Sagi

The Samguk Sagi is a historical record of the Three Kingdoms of Korea: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, completed in 1145, and is well-known in Korea as the oldest surviving chronicle of Korean history.[^113] Its compilation was ordered by King Injong of Goryeo (r. 1122-1146) and undertaken by a government official and historian named Kim Pusik with his team of junior scholars.[^114] Kim and his ten assistants set about gathering older sources, and although specific citations are rare, the bibliography of the Samguk Sagi lists 69 Korean and 123 Chinese works consulted.[^115] The Samguk Sagi, compiled by the general and official Kim Pusik, emphasizes the military exploits of certain Hwarang.[^116]

### The Samguk Yusa

The Samguk Yusa is a collection of legends, folktales, and historical accounts relating to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, compiled by the Buddhist monk Il-yeon in the late Goryeo dynasty, around 1280.[^117] While the author of Samguk Yusa was a devoted Buddhist monk, Samguk Sagi was written by a Confucian scholar-statesman, Kim Pusik, allowing readers to access the two different historical works from the differing perspectives of Buddhist monk or Confucian official.[^118] The Samguk Yusa emphasizes the group's Buddhist activities in contrast to the Samguk Sagi's military focus.[^119]

### Source Limitations

These works are the only remaining Korean sources for the period, making them invaluable for understanding the Hwarang and Korean history during the Three Kingdoms period.[^120] There is a lack of primary sources describing the Hwarang, with secondary literature drawing from lost primary sources, leading to hotly-debated topics among scholars about the true function of the organization.[^121]

---

## Legacy and Modern Influence

### Rediscovery and Nationalist Symbol

The history of the Hwarang was not widely known until after the National Liberation Day of Korea in 1945, after which the Hwarang became elevated to symbolic importance.[^122] This timing has influenced how scholars view the Hwarang's historical role versus their modern symbolic importance, with the organization becoming a powerful symbol of Korean nationalism and martial heritage in the 20th century.[^123]

### Influence on Modern Martial Arts

The ancient Hwarang warriors have significantly influenced modern Taekwondo philosophy and values.[^124] Kukkiwon historians often cite the Hwarang's influence on Taekwondo's values (courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control, and indomitable spirit) as a cornerstone of Korean martial arts identity.[^125] The Hwa Rang Do were responsible for promoting the martial arts of Taekyon and Subak throughout the peninsula of Korea, and lived by principles that are reflected today in the Tenets of Taekwondo and the Taekwondo Oath.[^126]

### Modern Hwa Rang Do Martial Art

Hwa Rang Do is a modern Korean martial art that is inspired by the ancient Hwarang warriors and their legacy.[^127] The modern martial art of Hwa Rang Do was founded by two Korean brothers, Joo Bang Lee and Joo Sang Lee.[^128] Lee Joobang is credited as the founder of Hwarangdo as he was the first to systemize all Hwarang techniques into modern martial arts, introducing this martial art to the public in the late 1950s and being officially recognized by the Korean government in 1960.[^129]

### Popular Culture Representation

In 2016, the South Korean television series "Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth" brought the Hwarang to international attention, starring Park Seo-joon, Go Ara, and Park Hyung-sik, and featuring the acting debut of Kim Tae-hyung (V) from BTS.[^130][^131] The series aired on KBS2 from December 19, 2016 to February 21, 2017, revolving around an elite group of young men called Hwarang who discover their passion, friendship and love in the turmoil of the Silla Kingdom.[^132] The drama is notable for its decidedly modern flavor despite its premise being rooted in history, making a deliberate attempt to portray the historical era in a modern interpretation to attract younger viewers.[^133][^134] Although based on true events, the producers did not focus on giving a historically accurate portrayal, taking creative liberties with history to create an entertaining drama that appeals to contemporary audiences.[^135]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view the Hwarang positively emphasize their crucial role in Silla's military successes and political development. The organization aimed at preparing young males for their future role in society, and the majority of the state's most important politicians and administrators were educated in the Hwarang.[^136] The Hwarang's comprehensive training system—combining martial prowess, ethical education, cultural refinement, and religious teachings—represented an innovative approach to elite education that balanced multiple aspects of human development.[^137] Their educational emphasis on loyalty, filial piety, and courage laid the ideological groundwork for Korean military ethos, and the Hwarang spirit, blending physical discipline with ethical cultivation, became a model for later Korean military systems.[^138]

The syncretic nature of Hwarang education, incorporating Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and indigenous Korean shamanism, demonstrates a sophisticated approach to moral and spiritual development that transcended sectarian boundaries.[^139] The organization served as a symbol of harmony and compromise between the king and the aristocracy, helping to maintain social cohesion during a critical period of Korean history.[^140] Famous Hwarang members like Kim Yu-sin and Kwanchang exemplified the highest ideals of loyalty, courage, and self-sacrifice, providing inspiring models for subsequent generations of Korean leaders and warriors.[^141]

### Negative Views and Critical Perspectives

Critics argue that the Hwarang's historical significance has been exaggerated for nationalist purposes, particularly after 1945 when the organization became elevated to symbolic importance.[^142] Some historians remain unclear about the precise role that the Hwarang played in the unification of the Three Kingdoms, questioning whether their military contributions were as decisive as traditionally claimed.[^143] The organization's exclusive recruitment from the true bone aristocratic class reinforced rigid social hierarchies and class distinctions, providing privileges only to an elite minority while excluding talented youth from lower social strata.[^144]

The controversy surrounding same-sex relationships within the Hwarang organization raises questions about aspects of the institution that have been downplayed or ignored in nationalist narratives.[^145] Some scholars posit that despite being celebrated as elite warriors, the Hwarang may actually have been a para-religious order composed of bands of commoners or even low-born subjects acting under aristocratic command, fundamentally different from the heroic image promoted in popular culture.[^146] The lack of direct archaeological evidence—with no artifacts specifically labeled as Hwarang discovered and epigraphic records rarely invoking "Hwarang" by name—suggests that the organization's importance may have been less prominent in their own time than later historical accounts suggest.[^147]

The authenticity debates surrounding the Hwarang Segi manuscripts, with most scholars considering them fictional works rather than genuine historical documents, further complicate our understanding of the organization and raise concerns about how much modern knowledge is based on unreliable or fabricated sources.[^148] The appropriation of Hwarang heritage by various martial arts schools making unfounded claims about their connection to the ancient organization demonstrates how the Hwarang legacy has been exploited for commercial and nationalist purposes, often with little historical basis.[^149]

## Cultural Significance

The Hwarang represent a unique synthesis of martial prowess, aesthetic refinement, religious devotion, and political service that distinguished them from comparable institutions in other cultures. Their practice of adorning themselves with cosmetics and fine clothing while simultaneously training as fierce warriors challenged conventional masculine stereotypes, creating a distinctive cultural model that valued both beauty and strength. The emphasis on nature excursions to sacred mountains integrated spiritual development with physical training, reflecting indigenous Korean shamanic beliefs about the connection between natural landscapes and divine power.

The Hwarang's educational curriculum—encompassing the Five Cardinal Confucian Virtues, the Six Arts, the Three Scholarly Occupations, and the Six Ways of Government Service—created well-rounded leaders capable of serving in multiple capacities within the state apparatus. This holistic approach to elite education influenced Korean conceptions of ideal leadership for centuries, establishing a cultural expectation that true leaders should possess both martial capabilities and cultural refinement.

The organization's role in facilitating social bonding and creating networks among aristocratic youth helped maintain stability within Silla's rigid bone-rank system, providing young nobles with shared experiences and values that transcended individual family loyalties. The death-companionship pledges, exemplified by Sadaham and Mugwanrang's bond, created intense personal loyalties that strengthened group cohesion and military effectiveness.
