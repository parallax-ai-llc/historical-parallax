## Summary

Raymond Albert Kroc (1902-1984) was an American businessman who transformed McDonald's from a single restaurant in San Bernardino, California, into the world's largest fast-food corporation.[^1] Though not the actual founder of McDonald's, Kroc purchased the company from Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1961 for $2.7 million and revolutionized the franchise industry through standardization, aggressive expansion, and innovative real estate strategies.[^2] His relentless pursuit of growth made him a billionaire and changed American eating habits forever, though his ruthless business tactics and treatment of the McDonald brothers remain controversial.[^3] By his death in 1984, McDonald's operated 7,500 outlets across 31 countries with system-wide sales exceeding $8 billion, cementing Kroc's legacy as both a visionary entrepreneur and a polarizing figure in American business history.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

Raymond Albert Kroc was born on October 5, 1902, in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb near Chicago, to Czech-American parents Rose Mary (née Hrach) and Alois "Louis" Kroc.[^5] His father, originally from the village of Břasy near Plzeň in Bohemia, worked for Western Union telegraph company and eventually rose to a high position within the organization.[^6] Alois was a disciplined man and passionate baseball fan, a love he passed on to his eldest son.[^7] Ray's mother, Rose Mary, was born in Illinois and worked as a homemaker while also earning extra money by teaching piano lessons to children and adults in the community.[^8] From her, Ray learned to play piano and showed a natural affinity for music that would remain with him throughout his life.[^9]

As the eldest of three children, with younger siblings Robert and Lorraine, Ray demonstrated entrepreneurial instincts from an early age.[^10] During his childhood, he operated a lemonade stand and worked at a soda fountain, showing an innate understanding of customer service and business operations.[^11] While attending Lincoln School in Oak Park, he excelled in debates, displaying a remarkable ability to persuade and convince others—a skill that would prove invaluable in his future business endeavors.[^12]

In 1916, at just 14 years old, Kroc and two friends opened the "Ray Kroc Music Emporium," selling sheet music while Ray performed on piano.[^13] Though the venture closed after only a few months, it provided young Ray with his first taste of business ownership and the challenges of entrepreneurship. His family experienced the volatility of American economic life firsthand when his father, who had made a fortune speculating on land during the 1920s boom, lost everything in the stock market crash of 1929.[^14]

At age 15, against his parents' wishes, Kroc made the fateful decision to leave Oak Park and River Forest High School before completing his education.[^15] Eager to serve in World War I, he lied about his age and joined the Red Cross as an ambulance driver.[^16] During his training, he met a young Walt Disney, with whom he would maintain a professional relationship throughout most of his life.[^17] However, the war ended before Kroc made it overseas, and he returned home to begin what would become a long and winding path to eventual success.[^18]

## Rise to Power

Ray Kroc's journey to becoming a fast-food magnate was anything but direct, marked by decades of struggle and perseverance before his transformative encounter with McDonald's. After returning from his brief World War I service, Kroc met Ethel Fleming in 1919, marrying her in 1922.[^19] The couple moved to Chicago, where their only child, daughter Marilyn, was born in October 1924.[^20] Kroc worked various sales jobs, eventually finding stability with the Lily-Tulip Cup Company, where he rose to the position of Midwestern sales manager.[^21]

In 1938, seeking greater independence and income potential, Kroc formed his own company, Prince Castle Sales, selling multimixer milkshake machines that could produce five milkshakes simultaneously.[^22] For the next fifteen years, he traveled extensively across the country, selling these mixers to restaurants and soda fountains. Though successful enough to make a living, Kroc remained a struggling salesman well into his fifties, watching younger men achieve the wealth and recognition that eluded him.[^23]

The pivotal moment in Kroc's life came in 1954 when, at age 52, he visited a hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California, owned by brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald.[^24] The restaurant had ordered an unusually large number of his multimixers, piquing Kroc's curiosity. What he discovered there transformed his understanding of the restaurant business. The McDonald brothers had developed an assembly-line "Speedee Service System" that emphasized speed, efficiency, standardization, and cleanliness.[^25] Kroc was mesmerized by their operation, watching customers receive their orders in seconds and seeing the potential for explosive growth through franchising.

Kroc convinced the reluctant McDonald brothers to allow him to become their franchise agent, and on March 2, 1955, they reached a formal agreement establishing McDonald's Systems, Inc.[^26] Just over a month later, on April 15, 1955, Kroc opened his first McDonald's restaurant in Des Plaines, Illinois, complete with the trademark "Golden Arches."[^27] This model location would serve as the blueprint for all future franchises and the training ground for Kroc's revolutionary approach to fast food.

Kroc's vision extended far beyond what the McDonald brothers had imagined. While they were content with their successful California operation, Kroc saw the potential for a national—and eventually international—empire.[^28] He maintained their efficient Speedee Service System but added his own innovations in franchising, standardization, and quality control.[^29] By 1959, McDonald's had opened its 100th store; by 1960, there were more than 200 locations.[^30]

The relationship between Kroc and the McDonald brothers grew increasingly strained as his ambitions clashed with their more conservative approach.[^31] In 1961, at age 62, when Ray's vision for rapid expansion was no longer compatible with the brothers' preferences, he bought them out for $2.7 million.[^32] With full control of McDonald's Corporation, Kroc was finally positioned to build the empire he had envisioned, transforming himself from a struggling milkshake machine salesman into one of America's most influential business leaders.

## Major Achievements

Ray Kroc's transformation of McDonald's into a global fast-food empire represents one of the most remarkable business success stories in American history, built on revolutionary innovations in franchising, standardization, and corporate strategy. After purchasing the company in 1961, Kroc served as president from 1955 to 1968, chairman of the board from 1968 to 1977, and senior chairman from 1977 until his death in 1984.[^33] Under his leadership, McDonald's grew to serve 19 million customers daily across more than 9,400 restaurants worldwide.[^34]

Kroc's most significant contribution was fundamentally reimagining the franchise business model. Unlike the common industry practice of selling large territorial franchises that provided quick profits but limited control, Kroc insisted on selling only single-store franchises.[^35] This approach gave McDonald's Corporation unprecedented oversight of franchisee operations and ensured consistent quality across all locations.[^36] He recognized that while selling exclusive licenses for large markets was the fastest way to make money, it sacrificed the franchisor's ability to control the chain's development and maintain standards.[^37]

Standardization became Kroc's obsession and the foundation of McDonald's success. He established exacting standards for every aspect of restaurant operations, from food preparation methods and portion sizes to cooking times and packaging.[^38] Every burger had to taste identical whether purchased in Illinois or California. To ensure franchisees understood and adhered to these standards, Kroc created a comprehensive training program in 1961 that later became known as Hamburger University.[^39] This institution trained franchisees not just in cooking hamburgers, but in the complete McDonald's system of operation, quality control, and customer service.

A pivotal innovation came through Kroc's partnership with financial executive Harry Sonneborn, who convinced him that McDonald's couldn't build an empire on a 1.4 percent cut of a 15-cent hamburger.[^40] Instead, Sonneborn proposed that the real money lay in owning the land upon which franchises operated. In 1956, Kroc established the Franchise Realty Corporation to purchase land tracts and serve as landlord to McDonald's franchisees.[^41] This real estate strategy provided steady upfront revenue when agreements were signed, generated capital for expansion, and gave McDonald's control over how franchisees operated their businesses.[^42] The model transformed McDonald's from a hamburger company into a real estate empire that happened to sell hamburgers.

Kroc's product innovations also shaped American food culture. He introduced the concept of the value meal, allowing customers to save money by ordering bundled meals, fundamentally changing how fast food was marketed and consumed.[^43] The Happy Meal, featuring toys alongside food, revolutionized how fast-food chains marketed to children and became one of the industry's most successful marketing concepts.[^44] Under Kroc's leadership, McDonald's also introduced the Big Mac in 1967 and opened its first international restaurant that same year, beginning the company's global expansion.[^45] The Egg McMuffin, introduced within some franchises in 1971, created the fast-food breakfast category that would become enormously profitable.[^46]

Kroc's aggressive expansion strategy drove exponential growth. He set ambitious goals, planning to build a company worth $25 million in less than five years by opening approximately 485 new locations annually through 1979.[^47] By 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public with common shares offered at $22.50 per share, providing capital for even more rapid expansion.[^48] When Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers in 1961, he had established 228 restaurants with sales of $37 million; by his death in 1984, system-wide sales exceeded $8 billion from 7,500 outlets in the United States and 31 other countries.[^49]

Beyond business operations, Kroc demonstrated social consciousness by establishing Ronald McDonald House Charities in 1974, which provides housing and support for families of seriously ill children.[^50] The organization has helped millions of families worldwide and represents one of the most successful corporate charitable initiatives in American history. In 1973, Kroc purchased the San Diego Padres baseball team, fulfilling a childhood dream and demonstrating his continued passion for the sport his father had instilled in him.[^51]

Kroc's influence extended beyond McDonald's to reshape the entire fast-food industry and American business practices. His emphasis on standardization, efficiency, and franchising created a model that countless other businesses have emulated.[^52] He proved that consistency and systems could triumph over culinary excellence, that real estate could be more valuable than the product sold on it, and that rapid expansion through careful franchisee selection could build a global empire.[^53]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his extraordinary business success, Ray Kroc's legacy is shadowed by serious ethical controversies, particularly regarding his treatment of the McDonald brothers and his ruthless business tactics. The most significant controversy centers on his acquisition of the company from Richard and Maurice McDonald. In 1961, Kroc purchased McDonald's for $2.7 million, the figure the brothers requested.[^54] However, the circumstances surrounding this transaction and its aftermath have been sources of enduring criticism.

The McDonald brothers believed they had a handshake agreement with Kroc for a percentage of future profits, but this arrangement was never honored.[^55] While the original franchise agreement specified that 1.9 percent of franchisee profits went to McDonald's Corporation and 0.5 percent went to the brothers, critics argue Kroc systematically undermined this arrangement.[^56] With their 0.5 percent royalty deal, the brothers could have earned $15 million by 1977 and would have eventually been pulling in $305 million annually.[^57] Instead, when the last surviving brother, Dick McDonald, died, he left behind $1.8 million compared to the $500 million fortune Kroc accumulated.[^58]

Perhaps most egregiously, after purchasing the company and its trademark, Kroc prevented the brothers from continuing to use the McDonald's name or insignia at their original San Bernardino restaurant.[^59] They were forced to rename it "Mac's Place" and later "The Big M," but these phases were short-lived because Kroc ordered the construction of a brand-new McDonald's on the same block, deliberately undermining their business.[^60] When confronted about this vindictive act, Kroc reportedly said, "I'm not normally a vindictive man, but this time I'm going to get those sons-of-bitches."[^61]

Kroc's treatment of the McDonald brothers extended to historical revisionism. In his autobiography "Grinding It Out," Kroc held himself out as the creator of McDonald's, portraying his first franchise location in Des Plaines, Illinois, opened in 1955, as the very first McDonald's ever.[^62] He conveniently ignored that the McDonald brothers had opened the first McDonald's seven years earlier in San Bernardino, California, in 1948.[^63] The brothers "were sort of erased from history," and they never fully comprehended that the concept they created would one day operate tens of thousands of restaurants worldwide.[^64]

Beyond his treatment of the McDonald brothers, Kroc's broader business practices have drawn ethical scrutiny from scholars and critics. Business ethics analyses of Kroc's career reveal "a relentless and determined entrepreneur" whose "lack of integrity in dealing with the McDonald brothers raises ethical concerns."[^65] He exploited legal loopholes and manipulated agreements to serve his interests, prioritizing aggressive expansion and financial gains over ethical considerations.[^66]

From academic perspectives examining business ethics, Kroc's story presents troubling implications: "practicing good ethics is evidently not as essential to a company's success as one might be led to believe."[^67] The success of McDonald's despite questionable ethical practices suggests that "achieving success in a free market economy leaves room for poor ethical practices to be beneficial rather than consequential."[^68] Business ethics scholars use Kroc's story to illustrate the harsh reality that "a business can thrive without good ethical practices."[^69]

Kroc's famous quote, "If any of my competitors were drowning, I'd stick a hose in their mouth," exemplifies his cutthroat attitude and ruthless approach to competition.[^70] His handling of business relationships, his willingness to break handshake agreements, and his aggressive tactics to eliminate competition have led critics to characterize him as a "double-dealing, ruthless businessman."[^71]

From a Kantian deontological ethics perspective, Kroc's decisions violated his obligations to the McDonald brothers, essentially allowing him to remove them from the business they created.[^72] He viewed his obligations as obsolete and unnecessary, prioritizing results over principles.[^73] His success came at the cost of exploiting others and rewriting history to position himself as the "founder" of McDonald's, raising the persistent question: does achieving success justify unethical actions?[^74]

## Personal Life

Ray Kroc's personal life was marked by complicated relationships, multiple marriages, and struggles with alcohol that contrasted sharply with his public image as a disciplined businessman. He was married three times, with each marriage reflecting different phases of his life and evolving fortune. His first marriage to Ethel Fleming, whom he met in 1919 and married in 1922, lasted nearly four decades but ended in divorce in 1961, the same year he purchased McDonald's.[^75] Together they had one daughter, Marilyn, born in October 1924, who remained Kroc's only child throughout his life.[^76]

The circumstances surrounding Kroc's third marriage reveal both the complexities of his character and the romantic drama that unfolded alongside his business success. In 1957, while still married to Ethel, the 55-year-old Kroc met Joan Beverly Smith (née Mansfield) in a Minnesota piano bar.[^77] He was instantly smitten with the woman 25 years his junior, despite both being married to other people at the time.[^78] Their relationship involved a remarkable 12-year courtship before they could finally marry, demonstrating Kroc's capacity for patience in his personal life that matched his business persistence.[^79]

Between his divorce from Ethel in 1961 and his marriage to Joan in 1969, Kroc briefly married Jane Dobbins Green in 1963, only to divorce her in 1968.[^80] This intermediate marriage appears to have been a transitional period while Kroc waited for Joan to become available. When Ray and Joan finally married in 1969, their union would last 15 years until his death in 1984, though it was far from the fairy tale one might expect given their lengthy courtship.[^81]

Joan's divorce papers filed in 1971—just two years into their marriage—described Ray's "violent, ungovernable temper," painting a picture of a man whose drive and intensity manifested destructively in his personal relationships.[^82] The couple mysteriously reconciled a couple of months later, but Ray's drinking plagued Joan throughout their marriage, suggesting that his wealth and success brought little domestic peace.[^83] Money, despite its abundance, did little to help Joan cope with her husband's demons.

The most devastating personal tragedy in Kroc's life occurred on September 11, 1973, when his only daughter, Marilyn, died at age 48.[^84] This loss came during a period when Kroc had achieved his greatest business triumphs, demonstrating that his professional success could not shield him from profound personal grief. That same year, he retired from actively running McDonald's and purchased the San Diego Padres baseball team, perhaps seeking new purpose after his daughter's death.[^85]

Kroc's health declined in his final years. In 1980, following a stroke, he entered an alcohol rehabilitation facility, finally confronting the drinking problem that had troubled his marriage to Joan.[^86] He reassigned himself to the role of senior chairman in 1977, a position he held until his death.[^87] On January 14, 1984, Kroc died of heart failure at a hospital in San Diego, California, at the age of 81, leaving behind a fortune estimated at $600 million.[^88]

Despite the turbulence of their marriage, Joan Kroc inherited Ray's fortune and transformed herself into one of America's most significant philanthropists. She spent the rest of her life, until her death in 2003, giving away the $3 billion fortune to organizations ranging from NPR to the Salvation Army.[^89] Ironically, Joan supported liberal causes that would have made the conservative businessman recoil in horror, including her posthumous $235 million gift to NPR and $2 billion gift to the Salvation Army to create recreation facilities.[^90] Her additional $1.6 billion bequest to open Salvation Army Kroc Centers represented the largest one-time gift ever recorded at that time.[^91] She also established and endowed the Joan B. Kroc Institute for International Peace Studies at the University of Notre Dame.[^92]

## Legacy

Ray Kroc's legacy extends far beyond the billions of hamburgers served under the Golden Arches, fundamentally transforming American business practices, eating habits, and global culture in ways both celebrated and criticized. His death in 1984 marked the end of an era, but the empire he built continues to shape the modern world, making him one of the most influential—if controversial—business figures of the twentieth century.

Kroc's most enduring contribution was revolutionizing the franchise model and proving that standardization and systems could create a global empire. As business historians note, "Raymond Kroc proved himself an industrial pioneer no less capable than Henry Ford, revolutionizing the American restaurant industry by imposing discipline on the production of hamburgers, french fries, and milk shakes."[^93] His innovative approach to franchising, emphasis on standardization and efficiency, and transformation of the food-service franchise model shaped not just fast food but countless other industries that adopted his principles.[^94]

The cultural impact of Kroc's McDonald's cannot be overstated. McDonald's became "a national symbol of an American way of life that included the power of American industry, freedom and opportunity, and a mass culture based on the standardization of products and lifestyles."[^95] Through rapid growth and extensive advertising, McDonald's in the early 1970s became the nation's largest fast-food chain and "an easily recognizable feature of the American cultural landscape."[^96] The company he built represents one of America's greatest exports, spreading American culture and business practices to virtually every corner of the globe.[^97]

McDonald's had a profound impact on American eating habits, with the company's emphasis on convenience, speed, and affordability helping to shape the country's fast food culture.[^98] However, this legacy includes a darker dimension: the rise of fast food chains like McDonald's contributed to a decline in the quality of the American diet, with increased consumption of processed and high-calorie foods.[^99] The health implications of the fast-food culture Kroc helped create remain subjects of ongoing debate and concern.

By the time of Kroc's death, the scope of his achievement was staggering. McDonald's had 7,500 outlets in the United States and 31 other countries and territories, with total system-wide sales exceeding $8 billion in 1983.[^100] In amassing a $600 million personal fortune, "the king of the hamburger transformed the nation's cultural landscape and forged an industry that is among America's greatest exports."[^101] Today, McDonald's serves approximately 70 million customers daily across more than 40,000 locations in over 100 countries, a testament to the enduring power of Kroc's vision.

Kroc's legacy in business education and entrepreneurial culture remains significant. His autobiography "Grinding It Out: The Making of McDonald's" is studied in business schools worldwide, and his story is taught as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale.[^102] His famous quotes about persistence, quality, and continuous growth—particularly "As long as you're green you're growing, as soon as you're ripe you start to rot"—continue to inspire entrepreneurs.[^103]

The philanthropic legacy Kroc initiated through Ronald McDonald House Charities in 1974 has helped millions of families worldwide, providing housing and support for families of seriously ill children.[^104] This charitable work represents a counterbalance to criticisms of his business ethics and demonstrates a capacity for compassion alongside his ruthless business tactics. The philanthropic legacy was exponentially expanded by his widow Joan, whose billions in donations to NPR, the Salvation Army, and peace studies transformed his business fortune into social good.[^105]

However, Kroc's legacy remains deeply contested. The controversy over his treatment of the McDonald brothers and his historical revisionism continues to generate debate about business ethics and the cost of success. Critics argue that his story demonstrates how "practicing good ethics is evidently not as essential to a company's success as one might be led to believe," raising uncomfortable questions about capitalism and moral responsibility.[^106] The 2016 film "The Founder" brought renewed attention to these controversies, presenting Kroc as a complex figure whose extraordinary achievements cannot be separated from his questionable methods.[^107]

Ultimately, Ray Kroc's legacy embodies the contradictions of American capitalism: extraordinary innovation and wealth creation alongside ruthless tactics and ethical compromises; the democratization of affordable food alongside concerns about nutrition and health; the spread of American culture worldwide alongside the homogenization of global cuisine and culture. Whether viewed as a visionary entrepreneur who changed the world or a ruthless businessman who exploited others' innovations, Kroc's impact on twentieth-century America and global business culture remains undeniable and continues to shape our world today.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Supporters and admirers of Ray Kroc emphasize his remarkable entrepreneurial vision, persistence, and transformative impact on American business and global commerce. From this perspective, Kroc emerges as a self-made success story who revolutionized an entire industry through innovation, discipline, and unwavering determination. Business historians frequently celebrate him as "an industrial pioneer no less capable than Henry Ford," whose systematization of fast food production represented a genuine revolution in American commerce.[^108]

Admirers point to Kroc's extraordinary persistence and refusal to accept failure as his defining characteristics. His famous quote, "I was an overnight success all right, but thirty years is a long, long night," captures the decades of struggle he endured before finding success with McDonald's.[^109] At age 52, when most men would be contemplating retirement, Kroc was still a traveling salesman; his willingness to bet everything on a new opportunity at that age demonstrates remarkable courage and vision.[^110]

Supporters argue that Kroc's standardization and quality control systems democratized good food, making consistent, affordable meals available to millions of Americans regardless of their location or economic status.[^111] His innovations in franchising created thousands of business opportunities for entrepreneurs who might otherwise have lacked the resources or knowledge to start successful restaurants.[^112] Hamburger University and his comprehensive training programs ensured that franchisees could succeed, creating a mutually beneficial system that generated wealth for many beyond Kroc himself.[^113]

From this perspective, Kroc's purchase of McDonald's from the brothers was a fair business transaction—he paid the $2.7 million they requested and transformed their regional concept into a global phenomenon they could never have achieved themselves.[^114] Defenders argue that without Kroc's vision, drive, and business acumen, McDonald's would have remained a successful regional restaurant rather than becoming an American icon and global empire. His ability to see potential where others saw merely a successful hamburger stand represented genuine entrepreneurial genius.[^115]

Business scholars who view Kroc positively emphasize his contributions to franchise law and practice, his innovations in real estate strategy, and his creation of systems that ensured consistent quality across thousands of locations.[^116] His work establishing Ronald McDonald House Charities demonstrated social consciousness and created lasting positive impact for families facing medical crises.[^117] Supporters note that his widow's extensive philanthropy, funded by the fortune Kroc created, has benefited countless causes and institutions, suggesting that his business success ultimately served broader social goods.[^118]

Admirers also highlight Kroc's philosophy of continuous improvement and growth, captured in his saying "As long as you're green you're growing, as soon as you're ripe you start to rot."[^119] This commitment to never being satisfied, to always striving for better, represents an entrepreneurial mindset that supporters believe drove American economic dominance in the twentieth century. From this perspective, Kroc embodied the American Dream: a man of modest means who, through talent, hard work, and vision, built an empire and changed the world.[^120]

### Negative Views

Critics of Ray Kroc present a starkly different assessment, portraying him as a ruthless opportunist who exploited the innovations of others, betrayed his partners, and prioritized profit over ethics, human relationships, and social responsibility. From this perspective, Kroc's legacy represents the darker dimensions of American capitalism, where success justifies any means and the powerful exploit the trusting.[^121]

The central criticism focuses on Kroc's treatment of Richard and Maurice McDonald, the actual founders whose innovations he appropriated. Critics emphasize that Kroc "was not the founder of McDonald's but rather a franchise agent who eventually bought out the original founders."[^122] His systematic erasure of the brothers from history—claiming in his autobiography that his 1955 Des Plaines location was the first McDonald's while ignoring the brothers' 1948 San Bernardino original—represents historical revisionism designed to aggrandize himself at others' expense.[^123]

Scholars analyzing Kroc's business ethics consistently identify serious moral failings. His "lack of integrity in dealing with the McDonald brothers raises ethical concerns," particularly his exploitation of "legal loopholes and manipulated agreements to serve his interests."[^124] The handshake agreement regarding royalties that Kroc never honored exemplifies what critics call "a clear breach of trust" that defined his approach to business relationships.[^125] His vindictive construction of a McDonald's on the same block as the brothers' renamed restaurant, accompanied by his statement about getting "those sons-of-bitches," reveals a cruel streak that contradicts any claims of fair dealing.[^126]

From academic perspectives on business ethics, Kroc's success despite unethical practices delivers a troubling message: that "achieving success in a free market economy leaves room for poor ethical practices to be beneficial rather than consequential."[^127] Critics argue his story demonstrates that "a business can thrive without good ethical practices," undermining the belief that ethical behavior and business success necessarily align.[^128] This makes Kroc's legacy particularly problematic for those seeking to promote ethical business practices, as he succeeded spectacularly while violating basic principles of fairness and honesty.[^129]

Beyond his treatment of the McDonald brothers, critics condemn the broader social impact of the fast-food culture Kroc created. The emphasis on convenience, speed, and affordability "contributed to a decline in the quality of the American diet, with increased consumption of processed and high-calorie foods."[^130] Public health advocates link the obesity epidemic and related health crises directly to the fast-food culture that McDonald's pioneered and popularized, making Kroc partially responsible for widespread health problems.[^131]

Critics also point to Kroc's personal failings—his "violent, ungovernable temper" as described in his wife Joan's divorce papers, his struggles with alcohol, and his inability to maintain stable personal relationships despite his business success.[^132] His famous quote, "If any of my competitors were drowning, I'd stick a hose in their mouth," reveals a worldview based on ruthless competition rather than ethical business practices or human compassion.[^133]

From deontological ethical perspectives, Kroc's behavior represents clear violations of moral duties and obligations. He "viewed his obligations as obsolete and unnecessary," prioritizing results over principles and demonstrating that his personal advancement justified betraying those who had trusted him.[^134] His success "came at the cost of exploiting others and rewriting history," raising the fundamental question of whether such achievements deserve celebration or condemnation.[^135]

Contemporary scholars note that viewing "The Founder" film about Kroc, many audiences came away believing he was a "double-dealing, ruthless businessman" whose methods should serve as a warning rather than inspiration.[^136] The contrast between the $1.8 million Dick McDonald left behind and Kroc's $600 million fortune powerfully illustrates critics' argument that the wrong people benefited from McDonald's success.[^137] Had the brothers retained their 0.5 percent royalty, they would have eventually earned $305 million annually, suggesting the scale of what critics view as Kroc's theft.[^138]

Ultimately, critics argue that celebrating Kroc as an entrepreneurial hero sends a dangerous message about acceptable business practices and the relationship between success and ethics. They contend that his legacy should include serious examination of the human cost of his ambition, the partners he betrayed, the historical record he distorted, and the public health consequences of the industry he built.[^139]
