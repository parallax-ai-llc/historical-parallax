## Summary

Gian Lorenzo Bernini (1598-1680) was the preeminent sculptor and architect of the Italian Baroque period, credited with creating and defining the Baroque style of sculpture.[^1] Over a career spanning more than six decades, Bernini served eight popes and transformed 17th-century Rome with his grandiose fountains, dramatic sculptures, and monumental architectural projects.[^2] His works—including the Baldachin of St. Peter's, the Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, and the colonnade of St. Peter's Square—established him as "the Michelangelo of his century."[^3] Though his career was marked by extraordinary triumphs and papal favor, it was also punctuated by scandal, professional failures, and fierce criticism that would persist for centuries.[^4]

---

## Early Life and Background

Gian Lorenzo Bernini was born on December 7, 1598, in Naples, Kingdom of Naples, the sixth of thirteen children born to Angelica Galante and Pietro Bernini.[^5] His father Pietro was a Florentine sculptor of modest reputation who had obtained employment on the decorative program of Pope Paul V.[^6] From his earliest years, Bernini displayed extraordinary artistic talent that his father recognized and nurtured with utmost devotion. By all accounts, the young Bernini was a child prodigy who showed an early aptitude for his father's profession; at the age of eight, he is said to have carved a marble head that excited general admiration.[^7]

In 1606, when Bernini was eight years old, his family moved to Rome after Pope Paul V invited Pietro to work on the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.[^8] Growing up in Rome—an epicenter for brilliant painters and sculptors—had a profound impact on Bernini's training and development as an artist.[^9] The principal artistic influences on the young sculptor were, first, his father, who guided and encouraged the boy's early efforts, and second, the Vatican itself, where he drew and studied the masterpieces of ancient sculpture and Renaissance painting.[^10]

When the proud Pietro managed to arrange an audience with Pope Paul V, the budding artist executed a quick and flattering portrait of Saint Paul, eliciting the admiration of the Pope, who believed himself to be in the presence of "the next Michelangelo" and demanded that the boy begin his formal artistic education at once.[^11] Pope Paul V famously remarked, "This child will be the Michelangelo of his age."[^12] When Bernini was not immersed in training as a sculptor, he, like most boys of middle-class families, was learning about the three Rs—reading, writing, and arithmetic—at home.[^13] His precocity earned him the admiration and favor of powerful patrons who hailed him as "the Michelangelo of his century."[^14]

## Rise to Prominence

Bernini's rise to artistic prominence began during his teenage years and accelerated dramatically in his twenties. His talent was recognized early, and by age fifteen, he had already demonstrated both his extraordinary skill and his intense commitment to his craft—reportedly burning his own leg to observe the expression of pain on his face for his sculpture of The Martyrdom of San Lorenzo.[^15] Between 1615 and 1625, Bernini created a series of groundbreaking works that would establish his reputation as the foremost sculptor in Rome.[^16]

The turning point in Bernini's career came with the patronage of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, for whom he created four extraordinary sculptural groups between 1619 and 1625: *Aeneas, Anchises, and Ascanius* (1619), *The Rape of Proserpina* (1621-22), *Apollo and Daphne* (1622-1625), and *David* (1623-24).[^17] These works "inaugurated a new era in the history of European sculpture," displaying an unprecedented dynamism, emotional intensity, and technical virtuosity.[^18] Unlike traditional sculpture that invited viewing from multiple angles, works like *Apollo and Daphne* were intended to be viewed from one spot as if they were a relief, revealing Bernini's theatrical approach to spatial composition.[^19]

In 1623, Maffeo Barberini became Pope Urban VIII, an event that would prove transformative for Bernini's career.[^20] A profound bond had already been formed between artist and prelate when Bernini was only nineteen, even before Barberini became pope; when Barberini returned to Rome he had commissioned Bernini's first masterpiece, *St. Sebastian* (1617).[^21] Pope Urban VIII told Bernini: "You are lucky to see Maffeo Barberini become pope, but we are even luckier because Bernini lives at the time of our pontificate."[^22] The Pope himself famously declared that Bernini was made for Rome and Rome was made for Bernini.[^23]

With the pontificate of Urban VIII (1623-44), Bernini entered a period of enormous productivity and artistic development.[^24] Urban VIII urged his protégé to paint and to practice architecture, expanding Bernini's artistic range beyond sculpture.[^25] In 1624, at the age of twenty-six, Bernini received his first major architectural commission: the design of a symbolic structure over the tomb of St. Peter in St. Peter's Basilica.[^26] Despite objections from some more experienced architects, the Fabric di San Pietro appointed Bernini to the position of Chief Architect of St. Peter's Basilica in 1629, when he was only thirty years old.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Bernini's artistic achievements spanned sculpture, architecture, and urban planning, fundamentally transforming the appearance of Baroque Rome. He created the Baroque style of sculpture and developed it to such an extent that other artists are of only minor importance in a discussion of that style.[^28] His works combined unprecedented technical mastery with theatrical drama and emotional intensity that defined the Baroque aesthetic.[^29]

### Sculptural Masterpieces

Bernini's sculptural works demonstrated a revolutionary approach to marble, making stone appear soft, fluid, and alive. His *David* (1623-1624) depicted the biblical figure the moment immediately before slaying Goliath, twisted back with hands gripping the sling, capturing a dynamic instant rather than the static poses favored by Renaissance masters.[^30] The *Ecstasy of Saint Teresa* (1647-1652), created for the Cornaro Chapel in Santa Maria della Vittoria, is regarded as one of Bernini's greatest pieces and the ne plus ultra work of the Baroque movement, as it most purely distills that style's emphasis on emotionalism, drama, and excess.[^31] The sculpture depicts the saint in a moment of spiritual rapture, with billowing drapery and divine light rendered in gilt bronze rays creating a complete theatrical environment.[^32]

His portrait busts revolutionized the genre through their psychological insight and lifelike presence. The famous *Bust of Costanza Bonarelli* (1636-37), portraying his mistress, was described as extraordinarily sensual, depicting not a modest, chaste woman but a passionate lover, with parted lips and wide-open eyes, her chemise falling open.[^33] During his visit to Paris in 1665 to design the east facade of the Louvre Palace, Bernini created the *Bust of Louis XIV*, starting work shortly after his arrival on June 20, 1665, and unveiling it just before his departure less than four months later.[^34] In 1632, he carved two famous busts of his dying friend, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, capturing the Cardinal's vitality even in his final days.[^35]

### Architectural Triumphs

Bernini's most monumental achievement was the *St. Peter's Baldachin* (1623-1634), a large bronze canopy inside St. Peter's Basilica commissioned by Pope Urban VIII.[^36] Starting work in 1624, Bernini unveiled four 20-meter-tall twisted Solomonic columns three years later, finishing this first major commission in St. Peter's Basilica in 1633.[^37] The Baldachin helped cement Bernini's status as the most distinguished sculptor in Rome and demonstrated his ability to work on an unprecedented architectural scale.[^38]

The pinnacle of Bernini's reconception of public spaces was his reworking of St. Peter's Square, planned beginning in 1656.[^39] He created a space where, in typical Baroque fashion, the visitor becomes part of the dramatic experience.[^40] Bernini's projects were essentially rooted in the Italian Baroque urbanist tradition of relating public buildings to their settings, often leading to innovative architectural expression in urban spaces like piazze or squares.[^41] His design for *Sant' Andrea al Quirinale* (1658-70) showcased his mastery of creating intimate yet dramatic sacred spaces.[^42]

### Fountains and Urban Design

Bernini transformed Rome's urban landscape with his monumental fountains, which combined sculpture, architecture, and water into unified artistic statements. The *Triton Fountain* (Fontana del Tritone) in Piazza Barberini, commissioned by Pope Urban VIII and completed in 1643, features a larger-than-lifesize muscular Triton depicted as a merman kneeling on a large shell, with his head thrown back and arms raising a conch to his lips from which water spurts.[^43]

His most complex fountain project was the *Fountain of the Four Rivers* (Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi) in Piazza Navona, designed in 1651 for Pope Innocent X.[^44] The fountain features a basin from which travertine rocks rise to support four river gods—representing the Nile (Africa), the Danube (Europe), the Ganges (Asia), and the Río de la Plata (Americas)—topped by a Roman copy of an Egyptian obelisk surmounted with the Pamphili family emblem.[^45] The Pope reportedly said, "The only way not to employ Bernini is to never see his designs," after seeing Bernini's design.[^46] The fountain was unveiled to the populace of Rome on June 12, 1651.[^47]

Urban VIII expended vast sums funding various substantial works by Bernini, who was particularly favored during this reign.[^48] The uniqueness of the relationship benefited both parties: Pope Urban was able to share in the artist's glory, while Bernini had the funding and support needed to perform his craft at the highest level.[^49] Through his many followers, apprentices, and students, Bernini's influence spread throughout Europe, and the Baroque style continued to flourish even after his death.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his extraordinary success, Bernini's career was marked by significant failures, professional rivalries, and personal scandals that tarnished his reputation and exposed the limits of his abilities.

### The Bell Tower Disaster

The infamous bell tower affair of 1644-1646 was the biggest failure of Bernini's career, both professionally and financially.[^51] This disaster had to do with Bernini's role in the disastrous project of the new bell towers for St. Peter's Basilica, designed and supervised entirely by him.[^52] Bernini's opponents in Rome succeeded in seriously damaging his reputation and in persuading Pope Innocent X to order the complete demolition of both towers, to Bernini's great humiliation and indeed financial detriment in the form of a substantial fine.[^53] His equestrian statues of Constantine and of Louis XIV were both considered failures as well.[^54]

### Career Eclipse Under Pope Innocent X

In 1644, with the death of Pope Urban VIII and the ascent to power of Pope Innocent X Pamphilj, Bernini's career suffered a major, unprecedented eclipse which was to last four years.[^55] Bernini's rival Francesco Borromini was the man who, with others, convinced Pope Innocent X that Bernini was a bungler and that his bell tower should be torn down.[^56] It was in architecture that Bernini's abilities were most often criticized and doubted.[^57] Only after Innocent's death and the accession of Alexander VII (Fabio Chigi) in 1655 was Bernini restored to full favor.[^58]

### Personal Scandal: The Costanza Bonarelli Affair

Before marriage, in 1636, Bernini began an affair with a married woman named Costanza Piccolomini Bonarelli, the wife of one of his assistants, when the artist was in his late thirties.[^59] Costanza had married the sculptor, restorer, and art dealer Matteo Bonarelli on February 16, 1632, in Rome.[^60] Bernini created a passionate portrait bust of her which he put on full display in 1637; his friend Fulvio Testi described it in a letter as the most beautiful portrait Bernini had ever created.[^61]

In summer 1638, Bernini discovered that Costanza was having an affair with his younger brother Luigi.[^62] He attacked Luigi with a crowbar, breaking two of his ribs, and then with a sword; Luigi saved himself by taking sanctuary in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore.[^63] In a fit of mad fury, Bernini chased Luigi through the streets of Rome and into the basilica.[^64] To punish his unfaithful mistress, Bernini had a servant go to Costanza's house, where the servant slashed her face several times with a razor, a traditional punishment for a woman who had offended a man's honor.[^65] Costanza was also sent to prison on charges of adultery and fornication.[^66]

Pope Urban VIII knew of the public feud but waived Bernini's fine of 3,000 scudi shortly after.[^67] Bernini himself was exonerated by the pope, even though he had committed a crime in ordering the face-slashing.[^68] Bernini was advised by the Pope to marry swiftly in order to move on, advice he took by marrying Caterina Tezio in 1639, a year after the scandal.[^69]

### Artistic Criticisms

Other critics of Bernini complained of over-exaggeration, saying that the expressions on the faces of his sculptures were overdone, hackneyed, and insincere.[^70] To a modern sensibility, Bernini the sculptor at times can seem too much the showman, rummaging through a bag of tricks to please his audience.[^71] His outsized ego plagued him throughout his life: not only maiming a mistress who had been unfaithful to him, but also making impolitic remarks about Louis XIV and Paris while living as the king's guest in France.[^72]

In the eighteenth century, Bernini and virtually all Baroque artists fell from favor in the neoclassical criticism of the Baroque, that criticism aimed above all at the latter's supposedly extravagant (and thus illegitimate) departures from the pristine, sober models of Greek and Roman antiquity.[^73] Scholars like Johann Winckelmann believed art should appeal to the mind whereas Bernini's art appealed excessively to the senses.[^74] Victorian-era critics like John Ruskin were particularly harsh, and Bernini fell out of favor among art critics after his death, only recently receiving praise again.[^75]

## Personal Life

Bernini was known for his easy-going, friendly, and witty personality, though he was a man driven by many passions, possessed of an explosive temper and a hearty sex drive.[^76] His darker impulses manifested early: at the age of fifteen, he burned his own leg to observe the expression of pain on his face for his sculpture of The Martyrdom of San Lorenzo, demonstrating an almost frightening dedication to his art.[^77]

In May 1639, at age forty-one, Bernini wed a twenty-two-year-old Roman woman, Caterina Tezio, in an arranged marriage under orders from Pope Urban VIII.[^78] They stayed married for thirty-four years until she died in 1673, and had eleven children—six girls and five boys, with two dying at birth.[^79] One of their children was youngest son Domenico Bernini, who would later become his father's first biographer.[^80] After his never-repeated episode of stalking and disfigurement by proxy in the Costanza affair, in his subsequent marriage Bernini turned more sincerely to the practice of his Catholic faith.[^81]

Bernini came from a large family himself, being the sixth of thirteen children born to his parents.[^82] He was recognized as a prodigy when he was only eight years old, and he was consistently encouraged by his father, Pietro.[^83] The close relationship with his father shaped not only his artistic development but his entire approach to life and work. After the scandal with Costanza Bonarelli, Bernini's wife Caterina provided stability for the remainder of his long career, though she remains a shadowy figure in historical records compared to the vivid presence of his mistress immortalized in marble.[^84]

## Legacy

Bernini's influence on Western art and architecture proved profound and enduring, despite periods when his reputation waned. Leopoldo Cicognara wrote that "perhaps no one, before or after Gian Lorenzo, has left so deep a mark on such a long period of art history; Bernini is synonymous with the Baroque."[^85] Much of the Baroque grandeur of the Eternal City—its churches, fountains, piazze, and monuments—can be credited to Bernini and his followers.[^86]

Bernini was credited with creating the Baroque style of sculpture and is considered the father of the Baroque style, which influenced both art and architecture across Europe for over 100 years.[^87] His innovative approach to sculpture and architecture defined the Baroque aesthetic, characterized by dramatic movement, emotional intensity, and theatricality.[^88] His dynamic compositions and bold use of space set new standards for artists and architects of the Baroque period, inspiring countless imitators and establishing a visual language that would dominate European art for generations.[^89]

Although by the end of Bernini's life there was in motion a decided reaction against his brand of flamboyant Baroque, the fact is that sculptors and architects continued to study his works and be influenced by them for several more decades.[^90] Through his many followers, apprentices, and students, the Baroque style continued to flourish even after Bernini's death.[^91] Thanks to the support of successive popes, Bernini became the leading sculptor in Rome, and his influence was felt worldwide.[^92]

It was only from the late 19th century that art historical scholarship began to recognize Bernini's achievements and restore his artistic reputation, seeking a more objective understanding within the specific cultural context.[^93] In the early 20th century, studies of Bernini's work multiplied on a small scale, but it wasn't until the 1930s that scholars began seriously cataloguing and analyzing all components of his oeuvre.[^94] In the postwar period, a handful of scholars emerged dedicated to Bernini's study, defining what is important in his oeuvre.[^95] Rudolf Wittkower, together with Hermann Brauer, took a crucial step in cataloguing Bernini's drawings.[^96] Scholar Irving Lavin's articles from the 1970s to the early 21st century set terms of discussion on topics including Bernini's religiosity and approach to Saint Peter's Basilica.[^97]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Modern scholars have come to appreciate Bernini as one of the greatest artists of the Western tradition. Over a long lifetime, Bernini undertook commissions for eight popes, transforming the look of 17th-century Rome as Michelangelo had helped shape Florence and Rome a century before.[^98] Contemporary Bernini scholarship involves interdisciplinary approaches combining art history, literary history, and theoretical analysis.[^99]

Rudolf Preimesberger redirected the study of Bernini's sculpture toward themes of art theory with influential articles that established new frameworks for understanding his work.[^100] Bernini's projects were essentially rooted in the Italian Baroque urbanist tradition of relating public buildings to their settings, often leading to innovative architectural expression in urban spaces.[^101] His ability to create unified artistic environments that combined sculpture, architecture, painting, and theatrical effects represented an unprecedented synthesis of the arts.[^102]

Defenders of Bernini's work emphasize his unparalleled technical mastery, his ability to capture human emotion and movement in stone, and his revolutionary approach to integrating art with architecture and urban space.[^103] His works at St. Peter's Basilica—the Baldachin, the Cathedra Petri, and the piazza colonnade—represent some of the most successful large-scale artistic projects in history, creating spaces that continue to move millions of visitors each year.[^104] His portrait busts are recognized as capturing not merely the physical likeness but the inner character and psychology of his subjects with unprecedented insight.[^105]

### Negative Views

Critics have persistently questioned both Bernini's artistic judgment and his personal character. The neoclassical backlash of the 18th century condemned Bernini's Baroque style as representing supposedly extravagant and illegitimate departures from the pristine, sober models of Greek and Roman antiquity.[^106] Scholars like Johann Winckelmann believed art should appeal to the mind, whereas Bernini's art appealed excessively to the senses, privileging emotion over reason.[^107]

Victorian-era critics like John Ruskin were particularly harsh in their assessments, and Bernini fell dramatically out of favor among art critics after his death.[^108] These critics complained of over-exaggeration, insisting that the expressions on the faces of his sculptures were overdone, hackneyed, and insincere.[^109] To certain modern sensibilities, Bernini the sculptor can seem too much the showman, rummaging through a bag of tricks to please his audience rather than pursuing pure artistic truth.[^110]

His architectural abilities were most often criticized and doubted, as evidenced by the bell tower disaster that led to his temporary eclipse under Pope Innocent X.[^111] His equestrian statues of Constantine and Louis XIV were both considered failures by contemporary and later critics.[^112] Beyond artistic criticisms, Bernini's personal conduct—particularly the violent episode involving Costanza Bonarelli—revealed a deeply flawed character.[^113] His outsized ego led him to make impolitic remarks about Louis XIV and Paris while living as the king's guest in France, damaging his international reputation.[^114]

Some modern scholars have questioned whether Bernini's undeniable technical virtuosity masked a certain shallowness of vision, arguing that his theatrical effects sometimes substituted for genuine spiritual depth.[^115] The very qualities that made him the perfect artist for the Counter-Reformation papacy—his ability to overwhelm viewers with sensory spectacle and emotional manipulation—also made him vulnerable to charges of artistic excess and spiritual superficiality.[^116]
