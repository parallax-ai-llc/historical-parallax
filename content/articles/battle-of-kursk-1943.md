## Overview

The Battle of Kursk (Operation Citadel) was the largest tank battle in history. In July 1943, Nazi Germany launched a massive pincer attack to cut off a Soviet salient (bulge) around the city of Kursk, hoping to encircle the Red Army and regain the initiative after the disaster at Stalingrad. However, thanks to British "Ultra" intercepts and the "Lucy" spy ring, the Soviets knew exactly when and where the attack was coming. They built a defensive network of unprecedented depth (mines, trenches, anti-tank guns). The German Panzers smashed into these defenses and were ground down. The climactic clash at Prokhorovka ended the German offensive, marking the point where the Wehrmacht lost the ability to launch strategic offensives in the East.

## The Battle Phases

### The Wait
Hitler delayed the attack repeatedly (from May to July) to wait for new Panther tanks.
**Consequence:** Gave Soviets months to dig in.
**Lucy Spy Ring:** Soviet spy in Switzerland warned Stalin of exact date (July 5).

### The Northern Pincer (Model's 9th Army)
Generl Walter Model's attack stalled almost immediately in minefields. Advanced only 6-10 km.

### The Southern Pincer (Manstein's Army Group South)
Made more progress. SS Panzer Corps breached formidable defenses but suffered huge losses.

### Battle of Prokhorovka (July 12)
**The Myth:** Hundreds of tanks charging each other at point-blank range in a dusty swirling melee.
**The Reality:**
- Soviet 5th Guards Tank Army counter-attacked the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler division.
- Soviet T-34s charged across open ground. Germans picked them off with 88mm guns from long range. Close combat occurred later.
- **Losses:** Soviets lost ~400 tanks; Germans lost ~80 tanks.
- **Result:** Tactical German success, but they were halted. They could not breakthrough.

## Outcome

**Operation Husky (July 10):**
Allies invaded Sicily. Hitler cancelled Operation Citadel to move SS divisions to Italy.

## Weapons Tech

| Weapon | Description | Performance at Kursk |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Tiger I** (Ger) | Heavy Tank (88mm gun) | Terrifying. Impenetrable frontal armor. Killed T-34s from 2km. |
| **Panther** (Ger) | Medium Tank | Debuted here. Many broke down mechanically (engine fires) before reaching battle. |
| **Ferdinand** (Ger) | Tank Destroyer | Thick armor, big gun. **Fatal Flaw:** No machine gun. Soviet infantry swarmed them with Molotovs. |
| **T-34** (Sov) | Medium Tank | Outclassed by Tigers. Tactic: "Ramming speed" to get close/disable tracks. |
| **IL-2 Sturmovik** | Ground Attack Plane | "The Flying Tank." Used hollow-charge bombs to destroy German armor roofs. |

## Casualties

| Side | Men (Killed/Wounded) | Tanks Lost | Aircraft Lost |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Germany** | ~200,000 | ~760 | ~681 |
| **Soviet Union** | ~860,000 | ~6,000 | ~1,600 |

*Note: Soviet losses were horrific (4:1 ratio), but they could replace them. Germany could not.*
