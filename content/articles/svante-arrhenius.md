## Summary

Svante Arrhenius was a Swedish scientist who received the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his theory of electrolytic dissociation. He was one of the first scientists to predict that carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels would cause global warming. His Arrhenius equation describes the temperature dependence of chemical reaction rates. He was a polymath who made contributions to chemistry, physics, and earth science.
