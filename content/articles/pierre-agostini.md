## Summary

Pierre Agostini is a French experimental physicist who shared the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physics for experimental methods that generate attosecond pulses of light for the study of electron dynamics in matter. His work enabled scientists to observe and measure events occurring at the attosecond timescale (10⁻¹⁸ seconds), opening windows into the ultrafast world of electron behavior.
