## Summary

Andrew William Mellon (1855-1937) was one of the wealthiest and most influential Americans of the early 20th century, serving as United States Secretary of the Treasury under three presidents from 1921 to 1932. As a banker and industrialist, he built a vast financial empire controlling companies like Alcoa and Gulf Oil, becoming the third-richest person in America behind only Rockefeller and Ford.[^1] His tenure as Treasury Secretary during the Roaring Twenties made him a hero to some and a villain to others—praised for tax cuts that fueled economic prosperity, yet blamed for policies that contributed to the Great Depression.[^2] A passionate art collector, Mellon's greatest legacy may be founding the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., donating both his extraordinary collection and the funds to build the museum.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Andrew William Mellon was born on March 24, 1855, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Thomas Mellon and Sarah Jane Negley.[^4] His paternal grandparents were Ulster Scots who migrated from County Tyrone, Ireland, in 1818 and settled in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.[^5] Thomas Mellon established a successful legal practice in Pittsburgh and in 1843 married Sarah Jane Negley, an heiress descended from some of the first settlers of Pittsburgh.[^6] Andrew was one of eight children, with three older brothers—Thomas A., James R., and Samuel—and a younger brother, Richard B. Mellon.[^7]

Young Mellon received his early education at home from a private tutor before attending public schools in Pittsburgh.[^8] He enrolled at Western University of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pittsburgh) but left three months before graduation in 1872.[^9] Despite not completing his degree, Mellon began working at his father's Pittsburgh bank, T. Mellon & Sons, in the early 1870s.[^10] His father recognized Andrew's exceptional business acumen, and in 1882, transferred ownership of the bank to him when Andrew was just 27 years old.[^11]

The foundation of Mellon's business philosophy was shaped by his father's teachings and the competitive industrial environment of late 19th-century Pittsburgh. Judge Thomas Mellon instilled in his son the values of hard work, financial discipline, and strategic investment.[^12] Pittsburgh itself was transforming into America's industrial heartland, creating unprecedented opportunities for financiers willing to back emerging industries with capital and vision.[^13]

## Rise to Power

In the three decades following his acquisition of the family bank, Andrew Mellon built an extraordinary financial-industrial empire by supplying capital for Pittsburgh-based corporations to expand in fields including aluminum, steel, oil, coal, coke, and synthetic abrasives.[^14] His strategy was not merely lending money but taking ownership stakes in promising ventures, transforming him from banker to industrial titan.[^15]

Mellon's first major success came in 1889 when the Pittsburgh Reduction Company (later Aluminum Company of America, or Alcoa) approached him for a loan.[^16] Recognizing aluminum's potential, Mellon provided financing and eventually gained total control of the company, establishing a virtual monopoly on aluminum production in America.[^17] No other firm had ever dominated a metal industry as completely as Alcoa dominated aluminum, from the 1890s until the 1940s.[^18] Through Alcoa, Mellon commandeered the use of an entire element, giving him control not just over aluminum but over all economic sectors dependent on it.[^19]

His second transformative investment came when a Texas oil company struck vast quantities of oil but lacked equipment to extract it efficiently.[^20] Mellon provided capital and, as with Alcoa, gained control of the company, which became Gulf Oil—the largest oil company outside of Standard Oil.[^21] At one point, five Fortune 500 companies owed their lineage directly to Mellon: Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Mellon Bank, Carborundum, and Koppers.[^22] He controlled a network of ninety-nine banks and had interests in coal, steel, chemicals, sleeping cars, railroads, building construction, utilities, magnesium, and airplanes.[^23]

Mellon's business partnerships with fellow Pittsburgh industrialists Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie further cemented his power.[^24] Judge Mellon was the first lender to young Henry Clay Frick, who became Andrew Mellon's best friend and mentor.[^25] In 1887, Frick and Mellon jointly purchased Old Overholt, one of the largest and most respected whiskey distilleries in the country.[^26] When Frick died in December 1919, he left his share to Mellon, making him the distillery's majority owner just as Prohibition began.[^27]

By the early 1920s, Mellon was one of the three wealthiest men in America, and by the end of the decade, he was the third-highest-income taxpayer in the nation, behind only John D. Rockefeller and Henry Ford.[^28] When President Warren G. Harding appointed him Secretary of the Treasury in 1921, Mellon brought to government an intimate understanding of American industry unmatched by any previous Treasury Secretary.[^29]

## Major Achievements

### Treasury Secretary Under Three Presidents

Andrew W. Mellon served as Secretary of the Treasury from March 4, 1921, to February 12, 1932—the third-longest tenure in American history.[^30] He served under Presidents Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover, presiding over the boom years of the Roaring Twenties.[^31] One admiring congressman called him "the greatest Secretary of the Treasury since Alexander Hamilton."[^32]

### Tax Reform and Economic Policy

Mellon's primary achievement was dramatic tax reform aimed at stimulating economic growth. He inherited a federal tax system with top marginal rates of 73 percent, imposed to finance World War I.[^33] Mellon argued that such rates were counterproductive, writing: "The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business."[^34] Between 1921 and 1929, Mellon successfully reduced the top marginal tax rate from 73 percent to 24 percent.[^35]

His tax philosophy anticipated what would later be called supply-side economics: lowering tax rates would stimulate economic activity and paradoxically increase overall tax revenue by encouraging more people to pay their taxes and invest in productive enterprises.[^36] The results appeared to vindicate his approach. The seven years from autumn 1922 to autumn 1929 were arguably the brightest period in American economic history.[^37] Unemployment dropped to 4 percent in 1925 and reached a peacetime century low of 1.9 percent in 1926.[^38] Economic growth soared, and Mellon helped foster remarkable growth in productivity, investment, and innovation.[^39]

### National Debt Reduction

Mellon also presided over a substantial reduction in the national debt during the 1920s, reversing the massive borrowing required by World War I.[^40] Through a combination of economic growth, tax reform, and fiscal discipline, he successfully reduced the government's obligations, earning widespread acclaim during the prosperous 1920s.[^41]

### Art Collection and the National Gallery

Beyond government service, Mellon's most enduring achievement was assembling one of the world's finest art collections and donating it to create the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.[^42] Under the influence of his friend Henry Frick, Mellon began collecting art in the 1910s, acquiring masterpieces including Rembrandts, Van Dycks, and Botticellis.[^43]

In 1930-1931, Mellon made his most spectacular acquisitions, purchasing twenty-one European masterpieces from the Soviet Union's Hermitage Museum in Leningrad for $6,654,052.94.[^44] Soviet dictator Josef Stalin was desperately selling off art treasures to finance rapid industrialization under the first Five Year Plan.[^45] Mellon paid $1,166,400 for Raphael's "Alba Madonna" alone—the highest price ever paid for a single painting at that time.[^46] The irony was profound: Mellon, a staunch anti-communist who had enthusiastically supported America's refusal to recognize the Soviet Union, became Stalin's best customer for looted Russian imperial art.[^47]

In 1937, Mellon donated his 152-piece art collection along with resources to construct a building to the United States government, one of the largest single gifts ever given to a government by a private citizen.[^48] He insisted the gallery not bear his name but the name of the nation, hoping his donation would inspire others to make similar gifts.[^49] His vision succeeded: Samuel and Rush Kress, Joseph Widener, and his own daughter Ailsa Mellon Bruce subsequently donated large collections.[^50]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Tax Policies Favoring the Wealthy

Mellon's tax policies generated intense controversy throughout his tenure. In the 1924 presidential election, Democrats and third-party candidate Robert La Follette denounced Mellon's proposals as "a device to relieve multi-millionaires at the expense of other taxpayers."[^51] Critics noted the concentration of benefits among the extremely wealthy. One senator observed that "Mr. Mellon himself gets a larger personal reduction than the aggregate of practically all the taxpayers in the state of Nebraska."[^52]

The apparent conflict of interest—one of America's richest men designing tax policy that dramatically benefited the wealthy—created lasting resentment.[^53] Critics argued that Mellon used his position to enrich himself and his class while ordinary Americans received comparatively little benefit.[^54]

### Prohibition and the Whiskey License Scandal

When Prohibition began in 1920, Mellon owned Old Overholt whiskey distillery.[^55] After becoming Treasury Secretary in 1921, he suddenly became responsible for administering "medicinal" whiskey licenses that allowed a select few distilleries to continue selling existing stocks to druggists.[^56] Mellon's department granted such a license to his own distillery—an obvious conflict of interest that scandalized prohibitionists.[^57] Under pressure, Mellon sold his share of the company in 1925, profiting handsomely from the medicinal whiskey license before divesting.[^58]

### Administrative Abuses and Political Vendettas

Critics accused Mellon of weaponizing the Bureau of Internal Revenue (precursor to the IRS) against political opponents.[^59] In his most bitter feud, Mellon had the Bureau investigate Republican Senator James Couzens, the wealthiest member of the Senate, after Couzens criticized Mellon's tax policies.[^60] The Bureau leaked information about Couzens's tax returns in an apparent attempt to damage him politically.[^61] Mellon also changed how the Bureau calculated tax liabilities incurred during World War I, benefiting certain taxpayers while hurting others.[^62]

### Monopoly Power and Industrial Concentration

Mellon's control of Alcoa represented one of the most complete industrial monopolies in American history.[^63] Critics argued that such concentration of economic power was fundamentally anti-democratic and harmful to consumers and competitors.[^64] Mellon's vast network of interlocking corporate interests—controlling aluminum, oil, banking, chemicals, and numerous other industries—raised concerns about excessive corporate consolidation.[^65]

### The Great Depression and "Liquidate Everything"

Mellon's reputation collapsed after the 1929 Wall Street crash and onset of the Great Depression.[^66] According to Herbert Hoover's memoirs, Mellon advised him to "liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system... People will work harder, live a more moral life."[^67] While no corroborative evidence has surfaced to confirm Hoover's claim, the quote became infamous as an example of heartless economic dogmatism.[^68]

Critics blamed Mellon's tax cuts for unleashing speculative frenzy that greased America's way into the Great Depression.[^69] Large companies gained power, financial speculation rose, and income inequality grew during the 1920s boom—a giant financial bubble was undergirding economic growth, but it was easy to overlook in the haze of prosperity.[^70] With unemployment approaching twenty percent, Mellon became one of the most "loathed leaders" in the United States, second only to Hoover himself.[^71]

### Impeachment and Tax Fraud Investigations

On January 6, 1932, Congressman Wright Patman of Texas initiated impeachment proceedings against Mellon "for high crimes and misdemeanors."[^72] Patman contended that Mellon violated numerous federal laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest, including an old statute prohibiting the Treasury Secretary from involvement with commerce or seagoing vessels.[^73] Mellon was accused of holding voting stock in more than 300 corporations while serving in public office.[^74] 

President Hoover removed Mellon from Washington by offering him the ambassadorship to the United Kingdom, and Mellon resigned as Treasury Secretary in February 1932 before the impeachment vote.[^75] After Franklin Roosevelt became president, Attorney General Homer Cummings launched a tax fraud inquiry into Mellon's history.[^76] Between February 1935 and May 1936, the Board of Tax Appeals heard a widely covered case accusing Mellon of tax fraud.[^77] A grand jury refused to indict by an 11-10 vote, but a civil tax trial ensued, ending with Mellon's estate paying several hundred thousand dollars in back taxes.[^78]

---

## Personal Life

### Marriage and Divorce

In 1898, while traveling to Europe with Henry Frick and his wife, Andrew Mellon met Nora McMullen, a nineteen-year-old Englishwoman of Ulster Scots ancestry.[^79] After a courtship during which Mellon visited McMullen's home at Hertford Castle in 1898 and 1899, the couple married in 1900.[^80] Nora gave birth to daughter Ailsa in 1901 and son Paul in 1907.[^81]

The marriage was troubled from the start. Nora disliked living in Pittsburgh and was unhappy in the union.[^82] By the end of 1903, she had begun an affair with Alfred George Curphey.[^83] To avoid public scandal, Andrew reluctantly agreed to a separation in 1909.[^84] In 1911, seeking to hold divorce proceedings privately before a judge rather than publicly before a jury, Mellon convinced the Pennsylvania legislature to amend a law that had required jury trials in divorce proceedings.[^85] Nora attacked Mellon in the press, and the divorce proceedings were widely covered by the media.[^86] In 1912, Mellon and Nora finally agreed on a divorce settlement, largely on Mellon's terms.[^87]

Mellon never remarried.[^88] Nora lived in Pittsburgh for several years before settling in the Hudson Valley, and the two children alternated living with either parent.[^89] In 1923, Nora married Harvey Arthur Lee, a British-born antiques dealer fourteen years her junior.[^90]

### Personality and Character

Mellon was known for his reserved, taciturn personality—a stark contrast to the gregarious politicians he served.[^91] He was intensely private, preferring the world of business and art to social engagements.[^92] His daughter Ailsa served as his official hostess during his tenure as Treasury Secretary from 1921 to 1932 and again when he was Ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1932-1933.[^93]

Despite his immense wealth, Mellon maintained relatively austere personal habits, focused on building businesses and assembling his art collection rather than ostentatious displays of wealth.[^94] His passion for art collecting, influenced by Frick, became an all-consuming interest in his later years, ultimately resulting in his greatest philanthropic legacy.[^95]

## Legacy

### The National Gallery of Art

Mellon's most enduring legacy is the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which opened in 1941, four years after his death.[^96] His original gift of 152 paintings and the funds to construct the building inspired subsequent generations of donors.[^97] The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, established by his children in 1969 by merging the Avalon Foundation and Old Dominion Foundation, continues supporting the Gallery and donates approximately $240 million annually to art restoration and museum development.[^98] The Foundation's cumulative support for the National Gallery reached $123 million (not adjusted for inflation).[^99] In 1978, a second building (the East Building) was completed, funded by the Foundation and Mellon's descendants.[^100]

### Family Philanthropic Dynasty

Both of Mellon's children became major philanthropists. Ailsa Mellon Bruce (1901-1969) bequeathed 153 paintings to the National Gallery at her death, primarily 19th-century French works, and established a fund for future acquisitions.[^101] The Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund purchased numerous masterpieces, including the portrait of Ginevra de' Benci—the only Leonardo da Vinci painting in the United States.[^102]

Paul Mellon (1907-1999) established the Old Dominion Foundation in 1941 and the Bollingen Foundation in 1945.[^103] In 1957, Fortune estimated that Paul, Ailsa, and their cousins Sarah Mellon and Richard King Mellon were among the richest eight people in the United States, with fortunes between $400 million and $500 million each.[^104] The Mellon family became patrons to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Yale University, and numerous other institutions.[^105]

### Carnegie Mellon University

In 1913, Andrew and his brother Richard established the Mellon Institute of Industrial Research as a department of the University of Pittsburgh.[^106] In 1967, the Institute merged with the Carnegie Institute of Technology (founded by Andrew Carnegie) to form Carnegie Mellon University, honoring both Pittsburgh philanthropists whose commitment to education and discovery laid the institution's foundation.[^107]

### Economic Policy Debates

Mellon's economic legacy remains intensely debated. Supply-side economists cite his tax cuts as proof that reducing rates on high earners stimulates growth and increases revenue.[^108] Critics counter that his policies increased inequality and contributed to the speculative bubble that caused the Great Depression.[^109] Economists and historians continue debating whether the seeds of the Great Depression were sown by the 1920s economic policies Mellon largely shaped.[^110]

His name became synonymous with both economic enlightenment and economic disaster, depending on one's political perspective—a controversy that endures nearly a century after his Treasury tenure.[^111]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Conservative and free-market economists have praised Mellon as a visionary who understood that high tax rates discourage economic activity and that prosperity benefits society more than redistributive taxation.[^112] Lawrence W. Reed noted that "Mellon's greatest contribution to America was not the vast wealth he created or gave away, but the vast wealth his fiscal policies allowed millions of other Americans to produce."[^113] Economists Richard Vedder and Lowell Gallaway contended that "the seven years from autumn 1922 to autumn 1929 were arguably the brightest period in the economic history of the United States."[^114]

Defenders argue that Mellon cannot be blamed for the Great Depression, which resulted from Federal Reserve monetary policy errors and international economic disruptions beyond Treasury control.[^115] They note that President Hoover rejected Mellon's laissez-faire advice and instead pursued interventionist policies including tariffs and public works programs.[^116] From this perspective, Mellon represents fiscal responsibility and pro-growth policies unfairly scapegoated for a crisis he did not cause.[^117]

His philanthropic legacy—particularly founding the National Gallery—has earned universal acclaim as a model of enlightened giving that enriched American cultural life.[^118] Mellon's insistence that the Gallery bear the nation's name rather than his own demonstrated genuine civic spirit.[^119]

### Negative Views

Progressive historians and economists condemn Mellon as a plutocrat who used public office to enrich himself and his class while ordinary Americans suffered.[^120] They argue his tax cuts primarily benefited the wealthy, increased inequality, and fueled the speculative excess that caused the 1929 crash.[^121] The concentration of economic gains among the top one percent during the 1920s—while Mellon designed tax policy—appears to validate critics' claims that his policies were fundamentally unfair.[^122]

Critics emphasize Mellon's conflicts of interest, from profiting from Prohibition while enforcing it to designing tax policy that dramatically reduced his own taxes.[^123] His weaponization of the Bureau of Internal Revenue against political opponents like Senator Couzens demonstrated corruption of government power for personal vendettas.[^124] The impeachment proceedings and subsequent tax fraud investigations suggest serious ethical lapses inconsistent with public service.[^125]

From this perspective, Mellon exemplifies the "robber baron" tradition—accumulating vast wealth through monopolistic practices (Alcoa), then using political power to protect and expand that wealth at public expense.[^126] His advice to "liquidate everything" during the Depression's onset revealed callous indifference to human suffering.[^127] The Great Depression's severity, critics argue, exposed the bankruptcy of Mellon's economic philosophy.[^128]
