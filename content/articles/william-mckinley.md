## Summary

William McKinley was the 25th President of the United States, serving from 1897 until his assassination in 1901.[^1] A Republican from Ohio, he led the nation during a period of rapid economic growth, industrial expansion, and American territorial acquisition following the Spanish-American War.[^2] McKinley's presidency marked a fundamental transformation in America's role on the world stage, establishing the United States as a global imperial power with overseas territories.[^3] He was assassinated by anarchist Leon Czolgosz on September 6, 1901, in Buffalo, New York, dying eight days later from his wounds.[^4]

## Early Life and Background

William McKinley Jr. was born on January 29, 1843, in Niles, Ohio, the seventh of eight children to reach maturity.[^5] His father, William McKinley Sr., managed charcoal furnaces and operated small-scale iron foundries throughout Ohio, instilling in young William a strong work ethic and respectful attitude.[^6] His mother, Nancy Allison McKinley, was a devout Methodist of Scottish ancestry who served as a guiding influence throughout his life.[^7]

In 1852, the family relocated from Niles to Poland, Ohio, specifically to provide their children access to better educational opportunities.[^8] McKinley attended a school run by the Presbyterian seminary in Poland, where he developed his talents for reading, debating, and public speaking, eventually becoming president of the school's first debate club.[^9] Education held paramount importance in the McKinley household, and William proved an enthusiastic and capable student.

Upon graduation, McKinley entered Allegheny College in Meadville, Pennsylvania, in 1860 at age 17.[^10] However, illness forced him to return home after only a few months, and although his health recovered, declining family finances prevented his return to college.[^11] He subsequently worked as a postal clerk and later taught at a school near Poland, Ohio, to help support his family.[^12]

When the Civil War erupted in 1861, the eighteen-year-old McKinley enlisted as a private in the Twenty-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry under the command of Major Rutherford B. Hayes, who would later become the 19th President of the United States.[^13] McKinley served with distinction at the Battle of Antietam in 1862, where his bravery earned him promotion to second lieutenant.[^14] He participated in campaigns throughout the Shenandoah Valley and remained in military service for four years, rising through the ranks until he was mustered out as a brevet major in July 1865.[^15] McKinley would be the last president to have served in the Civil War and the only one to begin service as an enlisted man and end it as a brevet major.[^16]

## Rise to Power

After the war, McKinley pursued a legal career, reading law in the office of Charles Glidden, a prominent Ohio attorney, and spending a term at Albany Law School in New York.[^17] He was admitted to the Ohio bar in March 1867 and opened a law practice in Canton, Ohio, where he would maintain a home until his death.[^18]

McKinley's entry into politics began in 1867 when he campaigned on behalf of his former commanding officer, Rutherford B. Hayes, who was running for governor of Ohio.[^19] In 1869, McKinley successfully ran for prosecuting attorney of Stark County, an office historically held by Democrats, winning an unexpected victory.[^20] He was defeated in his 1871 reelection bid by just 143 votes.[^21]

McKinley's high-profile defense of striking coal miners arrested after a clash with strikebreakers significantly raised his standing among laborers, a crucial constituency in Stark County.[^22] He took the case pro bono and successfully obtained acquittals for all but one of the miners.[^23]

In 1877, McKinley began his long congressional career as representative from Ohio's 17th district.[^24] He served in the House of Representatives until 1891, losing reelection only twice—in 1882 in an extremely close election, and in 1890 when Democrats gerrymandered his district.[^25] After President James Garfield's election in 1880, McKinley was selected to fill a vacancy on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee after serving only two terms.[^26] By 1886, McKinley, Senator John Sherman, and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the triumvirate leading the Ohio Republican Party.[^27]

The McKinley Tariff of 1890, which McKinley authored as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, raised average duties on imports to nearly 50 percent.[^28] McKinley earned the sobriquet "Napoleon of Protection" for his strong protectionist advocacy.[^29] However, many voters perceived the tariff as benefiting wealthy industrialists at their expense, and registered their displeasure in the fall 1890 elections, with House Republicans losing 93 seats and McKinley himself losing his seat.[^30]

Stunned by his defeat, McKinley returned to Ohio and successfully ran for governor in 1891, though by a narrow margin.[^31] With support from wealthy industrialist Mark Hanna, who would become his closest political adviser, McKinley won two terms as governor (1892-96).[^32] As governor, McKinley worked to mediate discord between management and labor, developing an arbitration system to settle labor disagreements and convincing reluctant Ohio Republicans to acknowledge workers' rights.[^33] He also procured legislation establishing an arbitration board, passed laws protecting railroad workers, addressed child labor issues, and fined employers who fired workers for union membership.[^34] He was easily reelected in November 1893, receiving the largest percentage of the vote of any Ohio governor since the Civil War.[^35]

McKinley's strong gubernatorial performance, combined with his nationwide support for Republican candidates, positioned him favorably for a presidential run in 1896.[^36]

## Major Achievements

### The 1896 Presidential Campaign

The 1896 presidential campaign revolutionized American political campaigning. While Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan traversed the country delivering impassioned "Cross of Gold" speeches, McKinley conducted an innovative "front porch campaign" from his home in Canton, Ohio.[^37] Mark Hanna orchestrated the campaign with unprecedented efficiency, arranging trainloads of voters to travel to Ohio at the campaign's expense to meet McKinley.[^38] Throughout the campaign, McKinley delivered more than 300 speeches to over 700,000 supporters who visited his Canton home between July and October 1896.[^39]

McKinley explained his strategy: "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. I have to think when I speak."[^40] Hanna raised millions for an educational campaign, distributing trainloads of pamphlets arguing that free silver would harm the economy and promoting protectionism.[^41] The strategy proved victorious on November 3, 1896, establishing the front porch campaign model and turning Hanna into a national symbol of political power.[^42]

### Economic Prosperity and Domestic Policy

McKinley assumed office during the waning days of the Great Depression of 1893-1897 and ushered in a period of remarkable economic growth and recovery.[^43] All economic indicators turned positive in 1897, and McKinley's economic policies accelerated the recovery.[^44]

McKinley called a special session of Congress to revise tariffs upward, having campaigned on increasing tariff revenue to reduce internal taxes and encourage domestic industry expansion and American employment.[^45] On July 24, 1897, he signed the Dingley Tariff, raising rates to an average of 49 percent—the highest protective tariff in American history to that point.[^46]

McKinley deftly maneuvered the United States onto the gold standard, fixing the dollar's value and reassuring investors in American assets.[^47] After successful economic conditions in 1900, McKinley urged Congress to pass legislation formally establishing the gold standard, and on March 14, 1900, he signed the Gold Standard Act using a gold pen, backing all currency with gold at a fixed price of $20.67 per ounce.[^48]

His administration held back on antitrust enforcement, enabling a massive wave of industrial combinations that brought economies of scale and widespread technological change.[^49] Under McKinley's leadership, nationwide unemployment fell, wages gradually rose, and inequality dropped to its lowest levels in fifteen years.[^50] Rapid economic growth and declining labor conflict characterized his presidency.[^51]

Interestingly, McKinley's views evolved during his presidency. Only a day before his assassination in 1901, he announced support for reciprocal trade treaties, representing a considerable shift from his earlier protectionist stance.[^52]

### The Spanish-American War

From the beginning of his administration, McKinley expressed concern about the Cuban insurrection against Spanish rule.[^53] When the USS Maine exploded and sank during an official visit to Havana on February 15, 1898, pressure for war intensified.[^54] Wary of conflict, McKinley urged Spain to agree to an armistice with Cuban rebels and demanded an end to civil rights abuses against the Cuban people.[^55] When the Spanish government wavered under pressure from its own public opinion, McKinley asked Congress on April 11, 1898, for authority to take military action against Spain in Cuba.[^56]

The United States declared war on April 25, 1898.[^57] The conflict lasted only ten weeks from declaration to the signing of the peace protocol in August 1898.[^58] During the fighting, McKinley operated a war room from the White House, equipped with detailed maps and a battery of telephones through which he maintained constant contact with his generals in the field.[^59] His actions represented a significant expansion of presidential power at the turn of the century.[^60]

Under the peace treaty signed in Paris on December 10, 1898, Spain relinquished Cuba and ceded Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines to the United States.[^61]

### Territorial Expansion and Imperial Policy

McKinley successfully led the United States through annexations of Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, and American Samoa, fundamentally transforming America's global position.[^62] The annexation of Hawaii proved particularly contentious. McKinley came to office supporting annexation and lobbied Congress aggressively, warning that inaction would invite a royalist counter-revolution or Japanese takeover.[^63]

When a treaty of annexation failed to achieve the required two-thirds Senate support, McKinley supported Representative Francis G. Newlands's effort to accomplish annexation through a joint resolution requiring only simple majorities in both houses.[^64] The Spanish-American War strengthened the annexationist argument by establishing Hawaii's strategic value as a mid-Pacific fueling station and naval installation.[^65] On July 7, 1898, McKinley signed the Newlands Resolution, officially annexing Hawaii despite a petition signed by 21,269 native Hawaiians—more than half the native Hawaiian population—opposing annexation.[^66]

### The Open Door Policy

In 1898, McKinley announced his desire for a policy allowing all countries equal access to trade with China.[^67] The United States' sphere of influence in China was not as well-established as those of European powers and Japan, and McKinley worried that other foreign powers would limit or block American trade with China.[^68]

In 1899, Secretary of State John Hay, serving under McKinley, circulated diplomatic notes among major world powers (Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Japan, and Russia) seeking formal approval for the Open Door Policy.[^69] This circular strongly expressed American desire to place all commercial nations on equal footing in China, unencumbered by discriminatory tariffs or restrictions, and declared U.S. support for a non-colonized and independent China.[^70]

During the Boxer Rebellion, Hay issued a second Open Door note warning America's expeditionary partners that the United States supported intervention only to rescue diplomats, not to bring China under European and Japanese control.[^71] The Open Door Policy established the United States as equal to the great European powers and placed America on the world's list of major powers.[^72]

### The 1900 Reelection Campaign

McKinley faced William Jennings Bryan again in the 1900 presidential election, held on November 6, 1900.[^73] With Vice President Garret Hobart having died in 1899, the Republican convention chose New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt as McKinley's running mate.[^74] Although Roosevelt considered the vice presidency relatively trivial and powerless, his great popularity among Republican delegates led to his selection.[^75]

McKinley again campaigned from his Canton front porch, greeting sixteen delegations and 30,000 supporters in a single day at the campaign's peak.[^76] Meanwhile, Roosevelt campaigned energetically across 24 states, covering 21,000 miles by train and attracting unusual attention that brought considerable votes to the Republican ticket.[^77]

The return of economic prosperity and recent victory in the Spanish-American War helped McKinley secure a decisive victory, receiving 7,218,491 votes (51.7 percent) to Bryan's 6,356,734 votes (45.5 percent).[^78]

## Controversies and Criticisms

### Imperialism and the Philippine-American War

McKinley's imperial policies generated intense controversy and opposition. He set the United States down the path of imperialist conquest, with the nation acquiring overseas territories and emerging on the world stage in unprecedented ways.[^79] McKinley justified Philippine annexation by claiming Filipinos were "unfit for self-government" and that the United States needed to "educate the Filipinos, and uplift and civilize and Christianize them."[^80] This paternalistic rationale reflected racial attitudes of the era but was deeply controversial even at the time.

On December 21, 1898, McKinley proclaimed a policy of "benevolent assimilation" toward the Philippines, declaring the U.S. would "exercise sovereignty" while aiming to "win the confidence, respect, and affection of the inhabitants."[^81] However, Filipino revolutionary leader Emilio Aguinaldo had already declared Philippine independence and established a revolutionary government.[^82] This standoff erupted into the Philippine-American War in early 1899.[^83]

The war involved significant brutality, with U.S. forces at times burning villages, implementing civilian reconcentration policies, and employing torture on suspected guerrillas.[^84] The conflict resulted in over 4,200 American deaths, over 20,000 Filipino combatant deaths, and as many as 200,000 Filipino civilian deaths from violence, famine, and disease.[^85] The conflict has been described as "a war of indiscriminate slaughter, institutionalized torture, and concentration camps."[^86]

### Anti-Imperialist Opposition

The anti-imperialist movement vigorously opposed McKinley's expansionist policies. Prominent figures including industrialist Andrew Carnegie, writer Mark Twain, former Democratic presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan, and dissident Republicans mounted a nationwide campaign.[^87] The Anti-Imperialist League grew into a mass movement with half a million members.[^88]

Mark Twain became vice president of the Anti-Imperialist League of New York in January 1901 and emerged as the movement's highest-profile critic through his writings and speeches.[^89] In his famous 1901 essay "To the Person Sitting in Darkness," Twain taunted McKinley as the "Master of the Game," satirizing American imperialism in the Philippines, the Boxer Rebellion, and the Boer War.[^90] Twain wrote to a friend expressing his distress that McKinley had "blundered up to his neck in the Philippine mess" and his grief that "this great big ignorant nation" stood "in disgrace before the sarcastic world."[^91]

Opposition came from diverse quarters—some found colonialism morally wrong, while others feared that annexation might permit non-white Filipinos a role in American government.[^92] The Senate vote on Philippine annexation came to 57 to 27, a one-vote margin above the required two-thirds majority for the annexationists.[^93]

### Racial Violence and Civil Rights Failures

One of McKinley's most significant failures involved his response to racial violence during the height of the Jim Crow era.[^94] When black postmasters were assaulted in Hogansville, Georgia, in 1897, and Lake City, South Carolina, in 1898, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation.[^95] Black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, though supporters claimed there was little the president could do to intervene federally, while critics countered he could at least publicly condemn such events.[^96]

Most damningly, when white supremacists violently overthrew the duly elected government of Wilmington, North Carolina, on November 10, 1898, McKinley refused requests by black leaders to send federal marshals or federal troops to protect black citizens and ignored residents' appeals for help.[^97] This failure to act against racial terrorism represented a profound moral failing of his administration.

### Historical Perception as Mediocre

For decades, McKinley was considered a mediocre president, controlled by political cronies and pressured into war with Spain by the press.[^98] He consistently ranks in the middle tier of presidents in historical surveys and rarely makes it into the top fifteen.[^99] In the 1960s, revisionist historians portrayed McKinley as a cunning and manipulative leader bent on expanding American influence through imperial conquest.[^100]

Critics note that McKinley's eponymous 1890 tariff preceded a Democratic wave in the 1890 midterm elections that cost him his House seat and was eventually replaced by a federal income tax.[^101] Some have argued that McKinley had failures in trusting the military in the Philippines and Cuba, sometimes making war worse than necessary.[^102]

## Personal Life

William McKinley married Ida Saxton on January 25, 1871, at the newly built First Presbyterian Church in Canton, Ohio, in a joint Methodist-Presbyterian service attended by one thousand people.[^103] Ida, age 23, was considered the belle of Canton, while William was 27.[^104] The first two years of their marriage were reportedly happy, with Ida affectionately calling William "major" in public and "dearest" in private.[^105]

The McKinleys had two daughters. Their first child, Katherine "Katie," was born on Christmas Day 1871.[^106] In April 1873, they had a second daughter, also named Ida.[^107] Tragically, both Ida's mother and her infant daughter died within months of each other in 1873, and two years later their only surviving daughter, Katie, succumbed to typhoid fever at age three.[^108]

Following these devastating losses, Ida developed a neurological condition later identified as epilepsy, experiencing seizures for the remainder of her life.[^109] She became increasingly reliant on her husband, living with significant health challenges that required constant care.[^110] William felt duty-bound to love and care for her in every way, never deferring any kindness he could extend.[^111] During short absences, he would write his wife, ending his letters, "Always your lover."[^112]

The devotion between William and Ida was evident throughout their life together, underscored by their mutual affection and Christian beliefs.[^113] When President McKinley was shot in Buffalo, New York, in 1901, his immediate thoughts were of Ida. As he fell, he whispered to an aide, "My wife, be careful…how you tell her—Oh be careful."[^114] His last words before dying were: "Goodbye, good-bye to all. It is God's way. His will be done – not ours."[^115]

McKinley's character has been described as gentle, generous, and true, seeking the welfare of his fellow men.[^116] His devoted and unflagging attentiveness to his chronically ill wife exemplified his desire to care for those less fortunate.[^117] By temperament, McKinley seemed bland, but he used an almost-insipid manner to mask his motivations, always giving himself room to maneuver while making interlocutors believe they shared his point of view.[^118] He was an affable man and an astute, patient politician whose skills and confidence enabled him to make firm decisions even when unpopular.[^119]

## Legacy

McKinley's assassination on September 6, 1901, by anarchist Leon Czolgosz at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo shocked the nation.[^120] Czolgosz, a 28-year-old Detroit resident of Polish heritage and unemployed mill worker, had embraced anarchism after losing his job during the Panic of 1893.[^121] He believed there was great injustice in American society, allowing the wealthy to exploit the poor, and concluded the structure of government was to blame.[^122] Czolgosz regarded McKinley as a symbol of oppression and felt it his duty as an anarchist to kill him.[^123]

Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen while the president stood in a receiving line shaking hands with the public.[^124] McKinley died eight days later on September 14, 1901, from gangrene caused by the wounds.[^125] Czolgosz was executed in the electric chair at Auburn Prison on October 29, 1901, his last words being: "I killed the president because he was the enemy of the good people—the working people."[^126] Theodore Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as president.[^127]

Under McKinley's leadership, the United States became one of the world's colonial powers, fundamentally transforming America's role on the world stage.[^128] His foreign policy created an overseas empire and put the United States on the world's list of major powers.[^129] McKinley helped create the modern presidency through his use of the telephone, the press, and publicity to conduct and manage war and political campaigns.[^130]

McKinley's economic legacy proved substantial. Characterized as one of the most economically successful presidents, his developmental state approach prioritized industrial growth and established a stable monetary system that laid groundwork for early 20th-century prosperity.[^131] His administration's policies enabled massive industrial combinations that transformed the American economy.[^132]

Recent scholarship has revealed a previously unexamined facet of McKinley's presidency: an ongoing dedication to African American advancement.[^133] During his first two years in office, McKinley named nearly as many African Americans to federal office as all his predecessors combined, including U.S. ministers to Haiti and Liberia, postmasters, consuls, midlevel agency appointees, and military officers.[^134] He acted on many fronts to stiffen federal penalties for participation in lynch mobs and support measures promoting racial tolerance.[^135] Some scholars suggest McKinley might be considered the first "civil rights president," especially compared to his next five successors, though his succumbing to political pressure limited his effectiveness in this area.[^136]

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Current scholarship views McKinley as a president who tried mightily to avoid war over Cuba despite public pressure, acted decisively when diplomatic options were exhausted, and asserted great presidential authority over his cabinet and generals.[^137] A consensus is emerging among scholars that McKinley helped create the modern presidency through his innovative use of communications technology and media management.[^138]

Presidential historians have taken a more thoughtful examination in recent years, viewing McKinley as a decisive leader who first put America on the road to world power.[^139] His economic management during a transformative period receives particular praise, with his Gold Standard Act and support for industrial growth credited with creating conditions for unprecedented prosperity.[^140]

Scholars now recognize McKinley as the chief determinant and mover of Republican domestic and foreign policy in the last years of the nineteenth century, not merely a tool of political bosses.[^141] His intelligence, attractive personality, and exemplary character made him an effective political leader capable of navigating complex challenges.[^142] McKinley was an affable man and astute politician whose skills enabled firm decision-making even on unpopular matters.[^143]

Benjamin R. Justesen's research reveals McKinley's previously unrecognized commitment to African American advancement, suggesting his civil rights work proved far more significant than previously thought and was halted only by his untimely death.[^144]

### Negative Views

Critics argue that McKinley set the United States on a path of imperial conquest that betrayed American ideals of self-determination and democracy.[^145] His paternalistic justifications for Philippine annexation—claiming Filipinos were "unfit for self-government" and needed to be "civilized and Christianized"—reflected racist assumptions that even contemporaries found objectionable.[^146]

The brutality of the Philippine-American War, including torture, village burning, and civilian reconcentration that caused massive civilian casualties, represents one of the darkest chapters in American military history, occurring under McKinley's command.[^147] Mark Twain and other anti-imperialists condemned what they saw as a betrayal of American principles, with Twain characterizing McKinley's policies as "a powerful nation being driven by brute expansionism, camouflaged by a cultural atmosphere of altruism."[^148]

McKinley's failure to protect African Americans from racial violence, particularly his refusal to intervene in the Wilmington coup of 1898, represents a profound moral failure that enabled the consolidation of Jim Crow oppression.[^149] While his appointments of African Americans to federal office were significant, his unwillingness to use presidential power to condemn or prevent racial terrorism undermined these efforts.[^150]

Some scholars maintain that McKinley's tariff policies failed, noting that the McKinley Tariff of 1890 contributed to Republican electoral losses and was eventually replaced by different revenue systems.[^151] His administration's lack of antitrust enforcement enabled monopolistic consolidation that created economic problems for future administrations to address.[^152]

The Hawaiian annexation, accomplished through a joint resolution to circumvent treaty requirements despite opposition from the majority of native Hawaiians, represents what critics view as an illegitimate imperial acquisition.[^153]
