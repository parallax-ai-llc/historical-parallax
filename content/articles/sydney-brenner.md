## Summary

Sydney Brenner was a South African-born British biologist who shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contributions to understanding genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death using C. elegans. He was one of the founders of molecular biology, helping to decipher the genetic code and discover messenger RNA. Brenner established C. elegans as a model organism for biological research.
