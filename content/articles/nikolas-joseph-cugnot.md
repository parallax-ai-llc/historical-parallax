## Summary

Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot was a French inventor who built the first self-propelled mechanical vehicle, a steam-powered tricycle (fardier à vapeur) in 1769. His steam wagon, designed to haul artillery for the French army, is considered the first automobile. He also may have caused the first automobile accident when his vehicle ran into a wall. His original vehicle survives in the Conservatoire national des arts et métiers in Paris.
