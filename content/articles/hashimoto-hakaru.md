## Summary

Hashimoto Hakaru was a Japanese physician who first described the autoimmune thyroid condition now known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 1912. His detailed histological observations identified the lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland. This was one of the first autoimmune diseases to be recognized, though the autoimmune mechanism was not understood until decades later.
