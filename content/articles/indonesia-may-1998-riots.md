## Summary

On May 12, 1998, soldiers opened fire on student protesters at Trisakti University in Jakarta, killing four. Their deaths ignited Indonesia's most destructive civil unrest since the 1960s. Over three days of rioting, more than 1,000 people died—many burned alive in looted buildings. Ethnic Chinese Indonesians were systematically targeted; women were gang-raped. On May 21, President Suharto resigned after 32 years of authoritarian rule. The Reformasi era had begun.[^1]

The immediate trigger was the Asian Financial Crisis, which had destroyed Indonesia's economy: the rupiah lost 85% of its value. But the underlying cause was three decades of corruption, repression, and a regime that had outlived whatever legitimacy it once possessed. Students had been protesting for months; the Trisakti massacre turned protest into revolution.[^2]

The May 1998 riots remain deeply traumatic, particularly for Chinese Indonesians. The systematic sexual violence—documented by investigators but long denied by the government—has never been fully acknowledged. No one has been held accountable for orchestrating the violence, which many believe was planned to discredit the reform movement. Indonesia became a democracy, but Reformasi is incomplete without justice.[^3]

## Historical Background

### Suharto's New Order

Suharto came to power amid mass violence in 1965-66:

- **1965-66:** Anti-communist massacres; 500,000-1,000,000 killed
- **New Order:** Authoritarian development regime from 1967
- **Economic growth:** Rapid industrialization; "Asian Tiger" aspirations
- **Repression:** Political opposition crushed; press controlled
- **Corruption:** Suharto family controlled vast economic empire
- **By 1998:** Suharto had ruled for 32 years[^4]

### Asian Financial Crisis

**1997-98:** The crisis devastated Indonesia:

- Rupiah fell from 2,600 to over 14,000 per dollar (85% collapse)
- IMF bailout with harsh conditions
- Food prices soared; unemployment surged
- GDP contracted ~14% in 1998
- Poverty rates jumped dramatically

The crisis exposed the regime's cronyism and corruption.[^5]

### Student Movement

**February-May 1998:**

- Student protests grew at universities nationwide
- Demands: Reformasi (reform), end corruption, presidential change
- Chanted: "Turunkan Suharto!" (Bring down Suharto!)
- Regime initially tolerated campus protests but not street marches

## The Event

### Trisakti Massacre (May 12)

**May 12, 1998:** Trisakti University, Jakarta

Students marched on campus; soldiers present nearby.

**Afternoon:** Soldiers opened fire on unarmed students.

**Four killed:**

- Elang Mulia Lesmana
- Heri Hertanto
- Hafidin Royan
- Hendriawan Sie

The killings outraged the nation. Who gave the order remains disputed.[^6]

### The Riots (May 13-15)

**May 13-15:** Three days of destruction

- Riots erupted across Jakarta, spreading to Medan, Surakarta, and other cities
- Looting of shopping centers (especially Chinese-owned)
- Arson: buildings, vehicles, homes burned
- **Death toll:** 1,000-1,200+ killed
  - Most died trapped in burning buildings
  - Some shot
- Property destruction: thousands of buildings

### Anti-Chinese Violence

Chinese Indonesians were systematically targeted:

- Long-standing racism; scapegoated for economic crisis
- Shops and homes specifically attacked
- Families assaulted; some killed
- **Mass exodus:** Tens of thousands fled to Singapore, Australia

### Sexual Violence

**Documented atrocities:**

- Mass rape, primarily targeting Chinese Indonesian women
- Gang rapes, often while husbands/families watched
- Brutal assaults, some fatal
- Rape accompanied by anti-Chinese slurs

**Official investigations:**

- Joint Fact-Finding Team (TGPF): Confirmed 52 rapes, 14 rape with assault, 10 sexual assaults
- National Human Rights Commission: 168 victims reported
- Actual numbers likely higher

The systematic nature suggests organization—though by whom remains officially unresolved.[^7]

## Suharto's Fall

### Parliament Occupation

## Historical Assessment

### Reformasi Perspective

**Democratic Victory:** The May 1998 events, despite their horror, ended 32 years of authoritarian rule and launched Indonesia's democratic transition. Students and civil society forced the regime out. Indonesia became Southeast Asia's largest democracy.[^10]

**Unfinished Justice:** The perpetrators of violence—especially the sexual violence—have never been held accountable. The riot's organization (suspected military involvement) remains officially uninvestigated. Without justice, Reformasi is incomplete.

### Chinese Indonesian Perspective

**Trauma and Exodus:** The targeted violence left deep scars. Tens of thousands left Indonesia permanently. Those who stayed live with memories of betrayal by neighbors and abandonment by the state. The denial of rapes compounds the trauma.

### Official/Military Perspective

**Denial:** Successive governments have avoided full accountability. The role of military figures (including Prabowo, now President) remains disputed. Some officials have denied the mass rapes occurred at all.[^11]

## Aftermath

### Immediate

- Habibie presidency (1998-1999): Transitional reforms
- Press freedom restored
- Political prisoners released
- East Timor allowed independence referendum (1999)

### Long-Term

**Democratic Progress:**

- First free elections (1999)
- Constitutional amendments
- Direct presidential elections (2004)
- Decentralization; regional autonomy

**Justice Deficit:**

- No prosecutions for Trisakti
- No accountability for anti-Chinese violence
- Sexual violence officially uninvestigated
- Prabowo never tried; elected President 2024

### Memorialization

- May 12 commemorated (Trisakti)
- Monuments to the four students
- Rape survivors largely invisible in national memory[^12]

## Legacy

### For Indonesia

- End of New Order
- Democratic transition (imperfect but significant)
- Trauma for Chinese Indonesian community
- Unresolved questions about military role

### For Democracy

- Student movements can topple dictators
- Economic crisis can accelerate regime collapse
- Democratic transitions don't guarantee justice

### The Unfinished Reckoning

Indonesia has achieved democracy without accountability for 1998. The same figures implicated in the violence now hold the highest offices. This represents Indonesia's fundamental challenge: how to build a just democracy on a foundation of impunity.[^13]
