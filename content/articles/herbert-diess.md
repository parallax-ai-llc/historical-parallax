## Summary

Herbert Diess served as CEO of Volkswagen Group from 2018 to 2022, leading the company's transformation toward electric vehicles after the dieselgate emissions scandal. He championed the ID. family of electric vehicles and VW's massive investment in EV manufacturing. His confrontational management style and push for rapid transformation created friction with labor unions and the Porsche-Piëch controlling family, ultimately leading to his departure.
