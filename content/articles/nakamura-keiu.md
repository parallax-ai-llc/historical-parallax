## Summary

Nakamura Keiu (中村 敬宇), also known by his given name Nakamura Masanao (中村 正直), was a pioneering Japanese educator, translator, and intellectual who played a crucial role in introducing Western thought to Japan during the Meiji period. Born to a samurai family in Edo in 1832, he began as a Confucian scholar before traveling to England in 1866, where he mastered English and encountered Victorian ideas that would shape his life's work.[^1] His translations of Samuel Smiles' *Self-Help* and John Stuart Mill's *On Liberty* became bestsellers and profoundly influenced an entire generation of Meiji-era Japanese leaders.[^2] A founder of the Meirokusha intellectual society and a progressive advocate for women's education and education for the blind, Nakamura uniquely synthesized Confucian values with Victorian liberalism, though his work has often been overshadowed by contemporaries like Fukuzawa Yukichi.[^3]

## Early Life and Background

Nakamura Masanao was born on June 24, 1832, in Edo (modern-day Tokyo) to a family serving the Tokugawa shogunate—his father worked as a policeman for the bakufu.[^4] From his early childhood, Nakamura demonstrated exceptional intellectual aptitude, showing a natural talent for learning that would define his life's trajectory.[^5] Growing up in the late Tokugawa period, a time when Japan remained largely isolated from Western influence, young Nakamura received a traditional education steeped in Confucian philosophy and Chinese classical learning.

In 1848, at the age of sixteen, Nakamura entered the prestigious Shoheiko (Shōheizaka Gakumonjo), the shogunate's official school for Chinese studies in Edo.[^6] The Shoheiko represented the highest seat of learning in Tokugawa Japan, focusing on Neo-Confucian canon taught in *kanbun*, a style of classical Chinese, and serving as a model for fief schools throughout the country.[^7] As a governmental school under direct control of the shogunate, it catered to the upper military class of the samurai, providing Nakamura with an elite education that grounded him deeply in Confucian thought, ethics, and classical Chinese scholarship.[^8]

During his formative years at the Shoheiko, Nakamura immersed himself in the works of Confucian masters, developing a philosophical foundation that emphasized duty (*shokubun*), social harmony, and moral cultivation. This traditional education shaped his worldview, yet it also prepared him to engage critically with new ideas when the opportunity arose. The combination of his samurai family background and rigorous Confucian training created a unique intellectual identity—one that would later enable him to serve as a bridge between Eastern and Western thought during Japan's tumultuous modernization.

The young scholar's life in Edo during the 1840s and 1850s coincided with mounting external pressures on Japan. The arrival of Commodore Perry's "Black Ships" in 1853 and subsequent forced opening of Japan to foreign trade created an atmosphere of crisis and urgent debate about how Japan should respond to Western power. This historical context would profoundly influence Nakamura's later decision to study abroad and his conviction that Japan needed to understand Western learning not merely as "skills and techniques" but as a comprehensive system encompassing both material and spiritual dimensions.[^9]

---

## Rise to Prominence

Nakamura's transformation from traditional Confucian scholar to pioneering advocate of Western learning began in 1866 when he was selected by the Tokugawa bakufu to accompany a group of fourteen students to study in Great Britain.[^10] Serving as academic supervisor for these young scholars, the thirty-four-year-old Nakamura seized the opportunity to master the English language and immerse himself in Victorian culture at a critical juncture in Japanese history. During his two years in England (1866-1868), Nakamura developed what he called an "integrated vision of Western learning," recognizing that Western civilization's strength derived not merely from technological superiority but from underlying philosophical, ethical, and spiritual principles.[^11]

Before departing for England, Nakamura wrote "A Letter Expressing My Aspiration to Study Abroad," in which he articulated a departure from the conventional view of "Western studies" as solely a practical discipline focused on material technology. He argued that Western learning encompassed ethics, politics, law, and other "spiritual disciplines," demonstrating a sophisticated understanding that would guide his subsequent intellectual work.[^12] This perspective positioned him as more intellectually ambitious than many contemporaries who viewed Western knowledge primarily as a means to military and industrial modernization.

The downfall of the Tokugawa regime in 1868 brought an abrupt end to the students' studies in London, forcing Nakamura to return to Japan in June of that year.[^13] However, during his time in England, he had received a copy of Samuel Smiles' *Self-Help* from his British friend H. Freeland—a book that would become central to his life's mission.[^14] Upon his return to a Japan undergoing revolutionary transformation under the Meiji Restoration, Nakamura immediately began work on translating Western texts that he believed could guide Japan's modernization while preserving its moral foundation.

In 1871, Nakamura published his translation of Smiles' *Self-Help* under the title *Saigoku Risshihen* (西国立志編), which was received as the "gospel" of a new age.[^15] The translation proved phenomenally successful, selling over one million copies by the end of the Meiji era and becoming what is believed to be the first self-development book in modern Japan.[^16] The following year, in 1872, he published *Jiyū no Ri* (自由之理), his translation of John Stuart Mill's *On Liberty*, which became equally influential and was "reportedly read by the entire generation of educated Japanese who came of age during the restoration."[^17] These translations established Nakamura as one of the foremost interpreters of Western thought in Meiji Japan.

In 1873, Nakamura founded the Dōjinsha, a private school in Koishikawa, Tokyo, where he taught English and Chinese.[^18] The school became one of the three major Western-style educational institutions in Japan during the Meiji period, alongside Keio Gijuku and Sansagakusha.[^19] That same year, he joined Mori Arinori, Nishimura Shigeki, Fukuzawa Yukichi, and other leading intellectuals in forming the Meirokusha, an association of scholars intended to "promote civilization and enlightenment" (*bunmei kaika*).[^20] The society played a prominent role in popularizing Western ideas through public lectures and its influential journal, the *Meiroku Zasshi*, to which Nakamura contributed prolifically—translating seven of the sixteen translated articles published in the bulletin, making him one of the journal's most active translators.[^21]

## Major Achievements

Nakamura Keiu's most enduring achievement was his role as a cultural translator who made Western ideas accessible to Japanese audiences while carefully adapting them to resonate with Japanese values and traditions. His translation of Samuel Smiles' *Self-Help* as *Saigoku Risshihen* fundamentally shaped Meiji Japan's conception of individualism, self-improvement, and personal responsibility. The book inspired a generation of entrepreneurs and leaders, including prominent figures such as Shibusawa Eiichi and Okura Kihachiro, who set up several major companies and credited Nakamura's translation with providing the philosophical foundation for their work.[^22] When the modern school system was established in 1872, *Saigoku Risshihen* was adopted as a textbook, though the Ministry of Education later disqualified it in 1880.[^23]

However, Nakamura's translation was not a literal rendering but a creative adaptation that revealed his sophisticated understanding of cross-cultural communication. Comparing *Saigoku Risshihen* with the original *Self-Help* reveals many omissions and free translations, as Nakamura judged some content unsuitable for Japanese audiences and other passages too difficult to translate effectively.[^24] Significantly, he used the Neo-Confucian term *shokubun* to translate the concept of "duty," breathing new life into this traditional concept while making Smiles' Victorian ethics comprehensible within a Confucian framework.[^25] This creative synthesis exemplified Nakamura's broader intellectual project of harmonizing Eastern and Western thought.

His 1872 translation of John Stuart Mill's *On Liberty*, titled *Jiyū no Ri* (or *Jiyū no Kotowari*), represented one of the most influential treatments of individual liberty during this formative period in Japanese history.[^26] The work introduced Mill's ideas about individual freedom, the harm principle, and the dangers of social tyranny to Japanese readers grappling with questions about the relationship between individual rights and collective obligations. Nakamura's interpretation placed liberty within the greater interests of society according to the ideal of duty, thereby expanding the meaning of both the Japanese concept and "liberty" in the Western sense.[^27] However, scholars have noted that Nakamura's translation of Mill's concept of "eccentricity" framed it negatively, influencing Meiji ideologues like Fukuzawa Yukichi and suggesting that his translation choices had significant ideological impact on how Western concepts were understood in Japan.[^28]

Beyond translation, Nakamura made pioneering contributions to education, particularly advocating for the education of women and marginalized groups. In 1875, he became a teacher at the Tokyo Girls' Normal School and later at Tokyo Imperial University.[^29] He also established a Dōjinsha girls' school in 1875, demonstrating his commitment to women's education at a time when such opportunities were severely limited.[^30] In a speech delivered on March 16, 1875, Nakamura coined the phrase *ryōsai kenbo* (良妻賢母), meaning "Good Wife, Wise Mother," which became a foundational concept in Japanese women's education policy.[^31] Contrary to assumptions that this represented traditional Confucian values, *ryōsai kenbo* was actually a modern construct influenced by European ideas about women's education and domestic roles.[^32]

Nakamura also worked with Scottish physician and missionary Henry Faulds to establish Rakuzen-kai in 1875, which became Japan's first society for the blind.[^33] Faulds helped found a school for the blind in 1880 and devised a Bible for the blind to read using raised letters—a forerunner of Braille—with Nakamura's support and advocacy.[^34] This work reflected Nakamura's humanitarian commitment to education for disabled children and his broader vision of enlightenment that extended to all members of society.

Through his work with the Meirokusha and contributions to the *Meiroku Zasshi*, Nakamura promoted Western political and philosophical ideas under the motto *bunmei kaika* (civilization and enlightenment).[^35] He contributed an article titled "On Changing the Character of the People" based on a speech from February 16, 1875, and took positions on key political debates of the era.[^36] Regarding the establishment of parliament, Nakamura supported the theory of gradual advance, arguing that civilization through enlightenment should be realized first before democratic institutions could function effectively.[^37] This position reflected his belief that cultural and intellectual transformation needed to precede political reform.

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite his contributions to Japanese modernization, Nakamura Keiu's work attracted significant criticism, both during his lifetime and from subsequent scholars. As one of the more radical members of the Meirokusha, Nakamura's views on Christianity and traditional beliefs generated controversy.[^38] He viewed Christianity as the foundation for the military and economic strength of Western nations and stated that Japan needed to discard its traditional beliefs as a necessary step in strengthening the nation.[^39] This position placed him at odds with conservatives who valued Japan's indigenous religious and philosophical traditions and saw Nakamura's advocacy as cultural betrayal.

His concept of *ryōsai kenbo* ("Good Wife, Wise Mother"), while initially progressive in advocating for women's education, became deeply controversial as it evolved into a tool for limiting women's social and political participation. The Meiji and Taishō governments used the *ryōsai kenbo* ideology to regulate women's activities, passing laws in 1890 and 1900 that prohibited women from attending political meetings and being involved in political organizations.[^40] Previous academic studies have interpreted *ryōsai kenbo* thought as a "backward," "feudal," or even "reactionary" view of women, arguing that it confined women to domestic roles rather than promoting genuine equality.[^41] Early feminist movements criticized the concept for limiting women's opportunities and reinforcing patriarchal structures, even as Nakamura himself had intended it to elevate women's education and social status.

Nakamura's translation methodology also faced scholarly criticism. His rendering of *Self-Help* and *On Liberty* involved significant omissions and free translations that altered the meaning of the original texts.[^42] Research has identified "a lack of unity in terms of translation in *Saigoku Risshihen*," suggesting inconsistencies that may have confused or misled readers about Smiles' original arguments.[^43] More significantly, Nakamura's negative framing of Mill's concept of "eccentricity" in his translation of *On Liberty* had ideological consequences, potentially influencing Meiji intellectuals to view individual nonconformity with suspicion rather than as a social good.[^44] This translation choice may have reinforced collectivist tendencies in Japanese society and undermined Mill's argument for protecting individual difference.

Furthermore, Nakamura's status and influence have been questioned by modern historians. While he was undoubtedly important during his lifetime, he has been overshadowed by contemporaries like Fukuzawa Yukichi, who was also a member of the Meirokusha. As one scholar notes, "sadly, in comparison with Fukuzawa Yukichi, he is generally only remembered today for his translation of Self-Help."[^45] This relative obscurity raises questions about whether his contributions were as transformative as those of other Meiji intellectuals or whether his attempts to synthesize Eastern and Western thought ultimately satisfied neither traditionalists nor modernizers.

Critics have also examined Nakamura's religious conversion and philosophical inconsistencies. His attempt to harmonize Christianity with Confucianism represented "a slight change of course," with some scholars arguing that the basis of his thought was "Christianized Confucianism" or "explaining Christianity from the perspective of Confucianism."[^46] This syncretism, while intellectually interesting, may have diluted both traditions and created a hybrid philosophy that lacked coherence. His conversion to Christianity in 1874, becoming the first prominent public figure to take this step, was seen by some as opportunistic—an attempt to align with Western power rather than a genuine spiritual transformation.[^47]

## Personal Life

Information about Nakamura Keiu's personal and family life remains limited in English-language sources, with most available materials focusing primarily on his professional accomplishments and intellectual contributions.[^48] Born in Edo (Tokyo) as the son of a policeman serving the Tokugawa shogunate, Nakamura came from a samurai family background that shaped his early education and social status.[^49] However, details about his wife, children, or domestic relationships have not been extensively documented in readily accessible historical records, suggesting that biographical works in Japanese may contain more comprehensive information about his private life.

What is known is that Nakamura's public persona was characterized by intense intellectual commitment and moral seriousness. His conversion to Christianity in 1874, when he was baptized and became the first prominent public figure in Meiji Japan to embrace the faith publicly, represented a profound personal transformation that integrated with his professional mission.[^50] Nakamura was one of the first prominent Japanese philosophers to convert to Christianity, which he tempered with Confucian humanism and belief in the innate goodness of humanity, creating a distinctive personal philosophy that rejected neither tradition entirely.[^51]

His religious beliefs were closely tied to his understanding of Western civilization's foundations. Nakamura viewed Christianity not merely as a personal faith but as the spiritual and moral foundation for the military and economic strength of Western nations.[^52] This utilitarian understanding of religion reflected the pragmatic dimensions of his thought, even as he appears to have held genuine conviction about Christianity's moral and spiritual truth. His attempt to harmonize Christian and Confucian teachings represented not just an intellectual exercise but a personal quest to integrate the different dimensions of his own identity and education.

Nakamura's personality appears to have been marked by a pedagogical commitment that extended beyond formal institutions. His advocacy for the education of women, children, and the blind reflected humanitarian values that went beyond mere professional duty.[^53] The fact that he personally established schools, taught at multiple institutions, and collaborated with foreign missionaries like Henry Faulds on charitable projects suggests a man driven by genuine compassion and a sense of moral responsibility to improve society through education.

His intellectual journey from traditional Confucian scholar to pioneering translator of Western liberal thought to Christian convert reveals a personality willing to transform radically in response to new ideas and historical circumstances. Yet throughout these changes, Nakamura maintained certain core commitments—to education, to moral cultivation, and to finding synthesis between competing worldviews rather than simply rejecting one for another. This intellectual flexibility and synthetic approach defined both his personal philosophy and his public work.

## Legacy

Nakamura Keiu's legacy is complex and multifaceted, encompassing both celebrated contributions to Japanese modernization and controversial influences that continue to provoke scholarly debate. His translations of *Self-Help* and *On Liberty* fundamentally shaped how an entire generation of Meiji Japanese understood concepts like individual improvement, liberty, and the relationship between the individual and society.[^54] The million-copy success of *Saigoku Risshihen* and its adoption as a textbook in Japan's new educational system meant that Nakamura's interpretation of Victorian self-help philosophy directly influenced the thinking of countless students, entrepreneurs, and leaders who built modern Japan.[^55]

The educational institutions Nakamura founded or led have left enduring imprints on Japanese society. His Dōjinsha school, which operated from 1873 until his death in 1891, was one of the three major Western-style schools teaching English during the Meiji period.[^56] More significantly, he headed what later became Ochanomizu University, today a prominent national women's university in Tokyo.[^57] Through these institutions and his teaching positions at Tokyo Girls' Normal School and Tokyo Imperial University, Nakamura directly educated and influenced numerous students who would carry forward his vision of synthesizing Eastern and Western learning.

His role in establishing Rakuzen-kai, Japan's first society for the blind, and the school for the blind in 1880 pioneered special education in Japan and demonstrated his commitment to inclusive education.[^58] The development of raised-letter texts as forerunners to Braille represented practical humanitarian work that complemented his broader philosophical contributions, showing that his vision of enlightenment extended to all members of society, including those most marginalized.

However, Nakamura's legacy is complicated by the controversial evolution of concepts he introduced. The *ryōsai kenbo* ("Good Wife, Wise Mother") ideal he coined in 1875, while initially intended to promote women's education, became a tool for limiting women's political and social participation.[^59] Governments used this ideology to justify laws restricting women's political activity, and feminist movements later criticized it as perpetuating patriarchal structures.[^60] This demonstrates how ideas can be appropriated and transformed in ways their originators might not have intended or endorsed, raising questions about intellectual responsibility and historical contingency.

In scholarly assessment, Nakamura is increasingly recognized as an "alternative" representative of modern Japanese enlightenment thought, notable for his familiarity with both Confucian and Western learning.[^61] Unlike mainstream Meiji intellectuals like Mori Arinori, Kato Hiroyuki, and Fukuzawa Yukichi, who largely embraced evolutionism and advocated abandoning traditional East Asian culture rooted in Confucianism, Nakamura formed the idea of "worship of Heaven and love for mankind," which he held was universal and formed ideological elements of both Eastern and Western culture.[^62] This synthetic approach represents an intellectual road not taken—a modernization that might have preserved greater continuity with tradition.

Earl H. Kinmonth's influential scholarly article "Nakamura Keiu and Samuel Smiles: A Victorian Confucian and a Confucian Victorian" has helped revive academic interest in Nakamura's work, framing him as a figure who embodied productive tensions between different cultural traditions.[^63] This scholarship positions Nakamura as more than a simple translator or imitator of Western thought, but rather as a creative thinker who adapted and transformed ideas across cultural boundaries.

Yet despite renewed scholarly attention, Nakamura remains relatively overshadowed by his contemporary Fukuzawa Yukichi, with one historian noting that "sadly, in comparison with Fukuzawa Yukichi, who like Nakamura was a member of the famous group of intellectuals in the Meirokusha, he is generally only remembered today for his translation of Self-Help."[^64] This relative obscurity in popular historical memory, despite his significant contributions, raises questions about how historical importance is determined and remembered.

Nakamura died on June 7, 1891, at the age of fifty-eight, and is buried in the Tendai temple Ryōgon-ji in Taitō, Tokyo.[^65] His death came at a moment when Japan was consolidating the Meiji reforms and moving toward more nationalistic and less cosmopolitan positions than those he had advocated. The tensions between Western learning and Eastern tradition that he spent his life trying to reconcile would continue to animate Japanese intellectual and political life well into the twentieth century.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

Scholars who view Nakamura Keiu favorably emphasize his unique role as a cultural synthesizer who attempted to bridge Eastern and Western thought during Japan's critical modernization period. Earl H. Kinmonth's seminal article "Nakamura Keiu and Samuel Smiles: A Victorian Confucian and a Confucian Victorian" presents Nakamura as a sophisticated thinker whose approach to translation and cultural adaptation demonstrated both deep understanding of Western ideas and creative fidelity to Japanese values.[^66] This perspective positions Nakamura not as a mere imitator or transmitter of Western thought but as an intellectual innovator who transformed ideas across cultural boundaries.

Contemporary historians increasingly recognize Nakamura as an "alternative" path within Japanese modernization—one that sought to preserve the best of Confucian tradition while incorporating Western learning, rather than wholesale rejection of Eastern culture.[^67] His concept of "worship of Heaven and love for mankind" as a universal principle shared by both Eastern and Western civilizations represented a cosmopolitan vision that contrasted with the more evolutionist and Western-centric views of mainstream Meiji intellectuals.[^68] Scholars argue that this approach offered a more balanced and sustainable path to modernization than the aggressive Westernization advocated by figures like Fukuzawa Yukichi.

Nakamura's contributions to education, particularly for women and the disabled, earn consistent praise from historians. His founding of educational institutions and advocacy for inclusive education demonstrated humanitarian values that transcended narrow intellectual debates.[^69] The fact that his institutions evolved into enduring educational establishments, including what became Ochanomizu University, testifies to the practical value of his vision.[^70] Supporters argue that his concept of *ryōsai kenbo*, while later misused, originally represented a progressive attempt to elevate women's status through education in a society that had traditionally devalued women's learning.[^71]

Admirers of Nakamura's translation work note that his creative adaptations, such as using the Confucian term *shokubun* to translate "duty," demonstrated sophisticated cross-cultural communication that made Western ideas comprehensible and relevant to Japanese audiences.[^72] The phenomenal commercial success of *Saigoku Risshihen*—selling over one million copies—and its direct influence on major entrepreneurs and leaders suggests that Nakamura's approach, while not literal, was highly effective in achieving its goal of inspiring self-improvement and modernization.[^73] His translations are credited with providing spiritual and philosophical guidance to an entire generation navigating the profound dislocations of the Meiji Restoration.

Recent scholarship examining Sino-Japanese cultural exchange has positioned Nakamura as an important node in transnational intellectual networks. His translations influenced Chinese reformers like Liang Qichao, who drew on Nakamura's work in formulating their own visions of modernization, demonstrating that his impact extended beyond Japan.[^74] This regional influence suggests that Nakamura's synthetic approach to Eastern and Western thought had broader resonance in East Asian contexts where similar tensions between tradition and modernity were being negotiated.

### Negative Views

Critics of Nakamura Keiu emphasize the problematic aspects of his legacy, particularly the ways his ideas were appropriated to serve conservative and patriarchal agendas. The evolution of *ryōsai kenbo* from an educational ideal into an ideology used to restrict women's political participation represents a significant failure, whether or not Nakamura intended this outcome.[^75] Feminist scholars and historians have characterized *ryōsai kenbo* thought as "backward," "feudal," and "reactionary," arguing that it fundamentally limited women's opportunities and reinforced domestic confinement at precisely the moment when modernity might have opened new possibilities for gender equality.[^76] The fact that governments used this concept to justify laws prohibiting women from political activity in 1890 and 1900 demonstrates its pernicious political consequences.[^77]

Scholarly analysis of Nakamura's translation work has revealed significant methodological problems. Research documenting "a lack of unity in terms of translation" in *Saigoku Risshihen* suggests inconsistencies that undermined the coherence of Smiles' arguments.[^78] More seriously, Nakamura's negative framing of Mill's concept of "eccentricity" in his translation of *On Liberty* may have distorted Mill's defense of individual nonconformity, potentially influencing Meiji intellectuals to view individual difference with suspicion rather than as beneficial to society.[^79] Critics argue that these translation choices reveal either incompetence or ideological bias that corrupted the very liberal ideas Nakamura claimed to be introducing.

From a modernization perspective, some historians view Nakamura's attempts to synthesize Confucianism and Western thought as ultimately incoherent and ineffective. His "Christianized Confucianism" or "explaining Christianity from the perspective of Confucianism" satisfied neither traditionalists, who saw his Christian conversion as betrayal, nor reformers, who viewed his continued attachment to Confucian concepts as holding Japan back from necessary transformation.[^80] His position that Japan needed to "discard its traditional beliefs" to strengthen the nation contradicted his simultaneous efforts to preserve Confucian values, revealing philosophical inconsistencies that undermined his credibility.[^81]

Critics also point to Nakamura's relative historical obscurity compared to contemporaries like Fukuzawa Yukichi as evidence that his contributions were ultimately less significant or transformative.[^82] While Fukuzawa's educational and intellectual legacy remains vibrant and influential, Nakamura is "generally only remembered today for his translation of Self-Help," suggesting that his broader philosophical project failed to achieve lasting impact.[^83] This relative marginalization in historical memory implies that his synthetic approach was less compelling or relevant than the more thoroughgoing Westernization advocated by other Meiji intellectuals.

Chinese intellectual critics, including prominent figures like Lu Xun and Zhu Ziqing, criticized concepts similar to *ryōsai kenbo* in Chinese contexts, viewing them as tools for perpetuating women's subordination under the guise of education and modernization.[^84] This regional criticism suggests that the problems with Nakamura's ideas were not merely Japanese phenomena but represented broader failures of attempts to modernize women's roles while maintaining patriarchal structures.

Some scholars question whether Nakamura's Christian conversion represented genuine spiritual commitment or opportunistic alignment with Western power. His utilitarian view of Christianity as "the foundation for the military and economic strength of the western nations" suggests instrumental rather than spiritual motivations, potentially undermining the authenticity of his claimed religious beliefs.[^85] This criticism portrays Nakamura as an intellectual opportunist who adopted fashionable Western ideas without deeply internalizing their values or understanding their implications.
