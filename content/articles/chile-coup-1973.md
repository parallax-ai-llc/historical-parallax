## Overview

The Chilean coup d'état of September 11, 1973, was one of the Cold War's most dramatic and consequential events. The Chilean military, led by General Augusto Pinochet and backed by the United States, overthrew the democratically elected socialist government of President Salvador Allende. Fighter jets bombed the La Moneda presidential palace. Allende died inside—officially by suicide. What followed was 17 years of brutal military dictatorship: 3,000+ killed or "disappeared," 40,000+ tortured, and Chile transformed into a laboratory for free-market economic policies. The coup symbolizes Cold War intervention and the violent suppression of democratic socialism.
