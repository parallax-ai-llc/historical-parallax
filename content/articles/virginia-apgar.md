## Summary

Virginia Apgar was an American obstetrical anesthesiologist who developed the Apgar score, a quick method for assessing the health of newborn babies. The Apgar score, introduced in 1952, evaluates five criteria (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) and has saved countless infant lives through early identification of distress. She later became an executive at the March of Dimes and was a major figure in the prevention of birth defects.
