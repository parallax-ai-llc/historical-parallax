## Summary

Samuel Crompton invented the spinning mule in 1779, which combined the features of the spinning jenny and the water frame to produce a stronger, finer, and more consistent yarn. His invention was fundamental to the British textile industry and the Industrial Revolution. He never profited from his invention as he could not afford a patent.
