## Summary

Zhu Xi was a Song Dynasty Neo-Confucian philosopher whose scientific observations included early concepts of geological change, fossils, and natural philosophy. He observed that marine fossils found on mountaintops proved the land had once been undersea, centuries before Western geologists made similar observations. His systematic approach influenced East Asian intellectual tradition.
