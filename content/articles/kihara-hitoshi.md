## Summary

Kihara Hitoshi was a Japanese geneticist and cytologist who discovered the genome analysis method for determining wheat phylogeny. He identified that bread wheat is a hexaploid with three ancestral genomes (AABBDD) and traced the evolutionary history of wheat species. His work was foundational for modern cereal crop genetics and breeding.
