## Summary

Munjong (born November 15, 1414; died June 1, 1452) was the 5th King of the Joseon Dynasty, reigning from 1450 to 1452.[^1] The eldest son of **King Sejong the Great**, Munjong is often remembered as a brilliant but physically frail monarch whose early death paved the way for the tragic usurpation by his brother, **Sejo**. Before becoming king, he served as Crown Prince for 29 years, actively assisting his father in inventing the Hangul alphabet and the **water gauge** (Chugugi). He was a capable administrator and military reformer who revised the military system, but his reign was cut short by illness after only two years.[^2]

## The Perfect Crown Prince

Munjong holds the record for the longest tenure as Crown Prince in the Joseon Dynasty (1421–1450).
*   **Proxy Regent:** Because King Sejong suffered from diabetes and eye problems in his later years, Munjong handled most state affairs as a proxy regent for eight years (1442–1450).
*   **Achievements:** He is credited with personally inventing the **Chugugi** (the world's first standardized rain gauge) and helping develop the **Hwacha** (a mobile rocket launcher) to defend the northern borders.[^3]

## Short Reign and Anxiety

Upon ascending the throne in 1450, Munjong was already in poor health.
*   **Succession Worries:** His biggest worry was his young son, the future King **Danjong**. Knowing he wouldn't live long, Munjong famously gathered his most trusted scholars (including Seong Sam-mun) and General **Kim Jong-seo**, begging them to protect the young Crown Prince after his death.[^4]
*   **Death:** He died of a carbuncle (tumor) on his back at the age of 37, leaving the throne to his 11-year-old son, setting the stage for the bloody power struggle that followed.[^5]
