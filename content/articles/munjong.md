## Overview

**Munjong** (1414–1452) was the 5th King of Joseon and the eldest son of the Great King Sejong.
He is considered one of the most tragic figures in Joseon history. He was the perfect Crown Prince—handsome, brilliant, scholarly, and benevolent. He served as Crown Prince for 29 years, actually running the country during the final years of Sejong's illness.
However, because he worked so hard alongside his father, his own health deteriorated. He reigned as King for only 2 years before dying of tuberculosis at age 37, leaving behind a 11-year-old son (**Danjong**) to face a pack of hungry wolves (ambitious uncles).

## The Inventor King?

While Sejong gets credit for the **Cheugugi (Rain Gauge)**, the Annals suggest it was actually the Crown Prince (Munjong) who invented the concept to measure rainfall scientifically for agriculture.
He also revised the military system and edited the *Goryeo-sa* (History of Goryeo).
He was physically impressive in his youth and famously handsome (described as looking like a scholarly god).

## The Tragedy of Divorces

Munjong had terrible luck with women (Crown Princesses), which destabilized the succession.
1.  **Lady Kim:** Divorced for using witchcraft (burying shoes) to gain his love.
2.  **Lady Bong:** Divorced for being a lesbian (sleeping with her maid, So-ssang).
3.  **Queen Hyeondeok:** His third wife, whom he loved. She gave birth to Danjong but died of puerperal fever shortly after.
Thus, when Munjong became King, he had no Queen to protect the young prince. When Munjong died, Danjong was an orphan with no powerful Queen Dowager to act as regent. This created the power vacuum that allowed his brother **Suyang (Sejo)** to usurp the throne.

## Legacy

If Munjong had lived 20 years longer, the Joseon Dynasty might have seen a "Golden Age Part 2" continuing Sejong's stability. His death is considered the "End of the Era of Peace" and the beginning of the "Era of Purges."
