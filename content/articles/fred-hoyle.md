## Summary

Fred Hoyle was a British astronomer who made important contributions to the theory of stellar nucleosynthesis and coined the term 'Big Bang' (originally as a derisive term). He showed how elements heavier than helium are created inside stars. Although his steady-state theory of the universe was superseded by the Big Bang theory, his work on nucleosynthesis was groundbreaking. He controversially did not share the Nobel Prize awarded to his collaborator William Fowler.
