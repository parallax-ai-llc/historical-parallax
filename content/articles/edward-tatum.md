## Summary

Edward Tatum was an American geneticist and biochemist who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with George Beadle for demonstrating that genes regulate chemical processes. Their experiments with the bread mold Neurospora crassa showed that specific genes control specific enzymes. He later contributed to bacterial genetics and recombination research with Joshua Lederberg.
