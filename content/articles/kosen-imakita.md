## Summary

Kosen Imakita was a Japanese Rinzai Zen master who was the abbot of Engakuji Temple and the teacher of Shaku Soen, who in turn became D.T. Suzuki's teacher. He opened Zen practice to lay practitioners, a revolutionary move that helped democratize Zen in modern Japan. He was one of the first Zen masters to engage with Western philosophy. His reforms laid the groundwork for Zen's eventual transmission to the West.
