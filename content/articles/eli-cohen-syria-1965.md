## Overview

Eli Cohen is Israel's national hero. An Egyptian-born Jew, he joined Mossad and created a fake identity: **Kamel Amin Thaabet**, a wealthy Syrian businessman returning from Argentina. He moved to Damascus in 1962.
He threw lavish parties for Syrian generals and politicians. He was so trusted that he was considered for the post of **Deputy Minister of Defense**.
From his apartment, he radioed top-secret military intelligence to Tel Aviv every day.

## The Eucalyptus Trees

His most famous coup.
He toured the Golan Heights fortifications (off-limits to civilians) with Syrian officers.
He pretended concern for the soldiers standing in the sun: *"Why not plant eucalyptus trees to give them shade?"*
The Syrians agreed.
**Result:** During the 1967 Six-Day War, the Israeli Air Force used the eucalyptus trees as **target markers**, knowing exactly where every bunker was. They captured the Golan Heights in two days.

## Discovery and Death

In 1965, Syrian counter-intelligence (with Soviet help) tracked his radio signal during a blackout.
He was caught mid-transmission.
Despite pleas from the Pope and governments worldwide, Syria publicly hanged him in Marjeh Square. His body was left hanging for six hours. Syria still refuses to return his remains.
