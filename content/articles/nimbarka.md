## Summary

Nimbarka was a Hindu philosopher and theologian who founded the Dvaitadvaita (dualism-non-dualism) school of Vedanta. He taught that God (Brahman), individual souls, and the world are both different and non-different from each other simultaneously. He was a devotee of Radha-Krishna and established the Nimbarka Sampradaya. His philosophy balanced the insights of both dualism and non-dualism, creating a distinctive theological position.
