## Summary

Husayn ibn Ali (626-680 CE) was the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad through his daughter Fatima and Ali ibn Abi Talib, the fourth caliph of Islam. Regarded as the third Imam in Shia Islam, Husayn refused to pledge allegiance to Yazid I, the Umayyad caliph, viewing his rule as unjust and tyrannical. His principled stand led to the Battle of Karbala on October 10, 680 CE, where he and approximately 72 followers were killed by a vastly superior Umayyad force. This martyrdom became a defining event in Islamic history, particularly for Shia Muslims, who view Husayn as a symbol of resistance against oppression and injustice.[^1][^2][^3]

## Early Life and Background

Husayn ibn Ali was born on January 11, 626 CE (3rd Sha'aban, 4 AH) in Medina, Arabia, into one of the most distinguished families in Islamic history.[^4] He was the second son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, who would later become the fourth caliph of Islam, and Fatima, the beloved daughter of Prophet Muhammad. His older brother was Hasan ibn Ali, who would precede him as the second Imam in Shia tradition. When Husayn was born, the Prophet Muhammad himself came to his daughter's house, took the newborn in his arms, and recited the Azan (call to prayer) and Iqamah in his ears, following Islamic tradition.[^5]

According to Islamic sources, when people saw tears in Muhammad's eyes while holding the infant Husayn, Fatima asked why he was crying. The Prophet told her that her son would achieve martyrdom, but consoled her by saying God would create a nation who would mourn Husayn until the Day of Judgment.[^6] This prophetic tradition would take on profound significance after Husayn's death at Karbala. Muhammad described both Husayn and his brother Hasan as "the leaders of the youth of paradise," establishing their spiritual significance from childhood.[^7]

Husayn spent the first seven years of his life in close proximity to his grandfather, the Prophet Muhammad, who died around 632 CE.[^8] These formative years in the Prophet's household profoundly shaped Husayn's character and religious understanding. Husayn is described in Islamic sources as resembling his grandfather Muhammad in appearance, though not as much as his older brother Hasan.[^9] He is a prominent member of the Ahl al-Bayt (the household of the Prophet) and is considered a participant in significant events such as the Mubahala, where Muhammad brought his closest family members to meet with Christian delegates from Najran.[^10]

The next twenty-five years of Husayn's life were spent in Medina with his father Ali, his brother Hasan, and other siblings in an extended family setting.[^11] During the caliphate of his father Ali (656-661 CE), Husayn accompanied him in military campaigns, gaining experience in warfare and political leadership.[^12] This period exposed him to the complex political divisions within the early Muslim community, particularly the conflicts between Ali and his opponents that would ultimately shape the Sunni-Shia divide. After Ali's assassination in 661 CE, Husayn supported his brother Hasan's brief caliphate and respected the controversial peace treaty Hasan made with Muawiya I, despite being advised by some to oppose it.[^13]

---

## Rise to Power

Husayn's path to political and religious leadership was gradual and marked by patience and principle rather than ambitious pursuit of power. After the death of his brother Hasan in 670 CE, possibly by poisoning, Husayn became the head of the Banu Hashim clan and the most prominent member of the Prophet's family.[^14] For the next nine years, during Muawiya I's caliphate, Husayn and many of Ali's supporters lived quietly in Medina, largely staying out of politics in accordance with Hasan's peace treaty with Muawiya.[^15] This period of political quietism did not diminish Husayn's moral authority or spiritual significance among those who revered the Prophet's family.

The critical turning point came in 680 CE when Muawiya I died and his son Yazid I succeeded him as caliph, transforming the caliphate from an ostensibly consultative position into a hereditary monarchy.[^16] The nomination of Yazid was contested by several prominent figures, including Husayn, who viewed Yazid as unqualified and his rule as illegitimate.[^17] Yazid demanded that Husayn and other dissidents pledge allegiance (bay'ah) to him, which Husayn refused to do in April 680.[^18] Husayn's refusal was based on principle: he believed Yazid lacked the moral and spiritual qualifications to lead the Muslim community and represented a corruption of Islamic values.

Faced with pressure and potential violence in Medina, Husayn left for Mecca without acknowledging Yazid, arriving at the beginning of May 680 and staying there through the summer.[^19] Mecca, as a sanctuary city, provided temporary refuge. While in Mecca, Husayn received an extraordinary outpouring of support from the people of Kufa, an Iraqi garrison town that had been the capital during his father Ali's caliphate.[^20] The Kufans were averse to the Syria-based Umayyad caliphs and had a long-standing attachment to the house of Ali.[^21]

The correspondence from Kufa was extensive and persuasive. In just one day, Husayn received around 600 letters from Kufa, with a total of approximately 12,000 letters arriving during his stay in Mecca.[^22] These letters invited him to Kufa, asked him to be their Imam, and pledged allegiance to him.[^23] The Kufans wrote that they were tired of the Umayyad rulers, had no rightful leader, and asked him to lead a revolt against Yazid.[^24] They presented Husayn's leadership as both his right and their need. In response to their call, Husayn sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqeel to Kufa to investigate whether the Kufans were sincere in their intentions and to assess the political situation.[^25]

Initially, Muslim's mission appeared successful, with thousands of Kufans pledging allegiance to Husayn. However, the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, newly appointed to Kufa, moved swiftly to suppress the pro-Alid movement through intimidation and violence. Muslim was captured and executed, and the Kufa supporters melted away under pressure.[^26] Despite receiving news of these dire developments, Husayn decided to proceed toward Kufa, believing he had a moral obligation to respond to those who had called upon him, even if the political situation had deteriorated.[^27]

## Major Achievements

Husayn ibn Ali's most significant achievement was his unwavering stand for principle in the face of overwhelming force, an act that would transform Islamic history and religious consciousness. His decision to refuse allegiance to Yazid I was not merely political dissent but a moral and theological statement about justice, legitimate authority, and the proper conduct of Islamic leadership.[^28] Husayn articulated his mission clearly, stating: "I have not risen up in revolt out of evil intent or greed, neither to perpetuate corruption nor wrongdoing. Rather I did so in quest of establishing right orders in the community of my grandfather. I wish to command right and forbid wrong and follow the example of my grandfather and my father Ali Ibn Abi Talib."[^29]

This declaration established Husayn's uprising as a reformist movement aimed at restoring what he viewed as authentic Islamic governance. His achievement was in maintaining moral clarity and refusing to compromise his principles even when faced with certain death. When given the option to submit to Yazid's authority and receive safe passage, Husayn declined, viewing submission as a betrayal of Islamic values and his responsibility as a member of the Prophet's family.[^30]

The stand at Karbala itself represents Husayn's greatest accomplishment, though it ended in his death. On October 2, 680, Husayn's caravan of about 72 men, along with women and children, was intercepted by a 1,000-strong Umayyad army and forced to encamp on the plain of Karbala.[^31] A larger army of approximately 4,000 soldiers soon arrived.[^32] Negotiations failed when Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad refused safe passage without Husayn's submission, a condition Husayn declined.[^33] Despite being vastly outnumbered and cut off from water, Husayn and his companions maintained their position.

On October 10, 680 (the 10th of Muharram, 61 AH), the Battle of Karbala took place. The engagement lasted from sunrise to sunset, with Husayn's small band fighting against overwhelming odds.[^34] Husayn watched as his companions and family members were killed one by one, including his son Ali Akbar, his half-brother Abbas (who was killed trying to bring water to the thirsty camp), and the sons of his extended family.[^35] At one point, a young child of Husayn's, sitting on his lap, was hit by an arrow and died.[^36] Finally, Husayn himself was killed and beheaded at age 57.[^37]

The aftermath was equally significant to Husayn's achievement. The bodies were left for three days without burial, and all the heads were taken along with the surviving members of Husayn's family as prisoners to Syria to be presented to Yazid.[^38] This brutality shocked the Muslim community and created a profound moral crisis for the Umayyad caliphate. Husayn's body was eventually buried in Karbala, near the site of his martyrdom, which became one of the holiest shrines in Shia Islam.[^39]

Husayn's achievement was transforming a military defeat into a moral and spiritual victory. His martyrdom gave the early pro-Alid political movement a distinct religious identity and helped transform it into a distinct religious sect—what became Shia Islam.[^40] For Shia Muslims, Husayn's death at Karbala is understood as a sacrifice made to prevent the corruption of Islam by tyrannical rulers and to protect Islamic ideology.[^41] His stand established the principle that Muslims have a duty to resist oppression and injustice, even at the cost of their lives.

The revenge for Husayn's death became a rallying cry that helped undermine the Umayyad caliphate and gave impetus to the rise of a powerful Shiite movement.[^42] Throughout subsequent Islamic history, Husayn's example has been invoked by those resisting oppression. In the 20th and 21st centuries, Shiites in countries such as Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon have interpreted Husayn's martyrdom at Karbala as symbolic of religious and political resistance against oppression, viewing Husayn as a role model in their daily lives.[^43]

## Controversies and Criticisms

Despite Husayn's veneration by the majority of Muslims, his decision to march toward Kufa and the events leading to Karbala have generated historical debate and criticism. Some Sunni scholars have criticized Husayn for his uprising against Yazid, with figures like Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi accusing him of dividing the Muslim community (ummah) during a time when unity was essential.[^44] These critics argue that Husayn's revolt violated the principle of avoiding fitna (internal strife) and that he should have prioritized communal stability over his objections to Yazid's leadership.

Several wise companions who loved Husayn advised him not to go to Iraq, including Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar, Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri, and others.[^45] These advisors warned him that the people of Kufa were unreliable and had previously betrayed his father Ali and his brother Hasan. The fact that their warnings proved accurate—the Kufans abandoned their pledges when pressure was applied—has led some to question Husayn's political judgment. Critics argue that he walked into a trap that could have been avoided with more cautious assessment of the situation.

A more controversial objection, though one largely rejected by scholars, is the notion that Husayn was after worldly gain or political power for its own sake.[^46] Some Christian critics in medieval polemical literature alleged he fought to satisfy worldly desires and ambitions.[^47] However, there is nothing in credible historical and hadith literature that proves Husayn was after power rather than principled reform. His refusal of offers of safe passage in exchange for submission, and his willingness to face certain death, contradict accusations of mere power-seeking.

Only Umayyad adherents who considered Husayn "a rebel against the established authority" condoned his murder by Yazid, but their opinion was opposed by the majority of Muslims, according to scholar Laura Veccia Vaglieri.[^48] Even those who questioned Husayn's political strategy generally acknowledged his honorable intentions and his status as the Prophet's grandson.

The historical narrative of Karbala itself has been subject to scrutiny. Scholar Henri Lammens argued there was no extended battle at all but rather a quick massacre based on an official report to Caliph Yazid.[^49] However, historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri countered that contemporary accounts form "a coherent and credible narrative" and criticized Lammens' hypothesis as based on a single isolated report.[^50] Scholars Madelung and Wellhausen assert the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset and that the overall account is reliable.[^51]

The question of responsibility for Husayn's death has caused significant sectarian tension throughout Islamic history. Different communities blame different actors—some emphasize the Kufans' betrayal, others focus on Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's cruelty, while others hold Yazid ultimately responsible.[^52] This question has caused anger and violence, with people even being killed because of the version of history they believe.[^53]

Some commemorative practices associated with Husayn have also generated controversy within the Muslim community. Extreme forms of self-flagellation practiced during Ashura mourning rituals, sometimes involving self-inflicted bloodshed, are highly controversial and condemned by many Shia scholars as innovative practices that damage the reputation of Shia Islam.[^54] Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned such practices in Iran in 1994.[^55] These rituals, rather than Husayn's actions themselves, represent the controversial aspects of his legacy.

## Personal Life

Husayn ibn Ali married five times and had several children who played significant roles in Islamic history.[^56] His first wife was Shahrbanu (also called Shahr Banu or Shahezanan), daughter of Yazd Gurd, the last Sasanian emperor of Iran.[^57] She was the mother of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin (born 658/659 CE in Kufa), who would become the fourth Imam in Shia tradition and the only adult male of Husayn's family to survive Karbala due to illness that prevented him from fighting.[^58] Shahrbanu died within ten days of giving birth to Ali Zayn al-Abidin.[^59]

His second wife was Layla, daughter of Abu Murra ibn Urwah ibn Masud al-Thaqafi, who was the mother of Ali al-Akbar (Ali the Elder).[^60] Ali al-Akbar fought valiantly at Karbala and was killed during the battle, his death being one of the most mourned in Shia tradition. Husayn's third wife was Rabab, daughter of Imru al-Qays ibn Adi al-Kalbi, who was the mother of Sakina (also spelled Sukayna), Husayn's beloved daughter.[^61] Rabab was renowned as one of the best and most learned women of her time. After Husayn's martyrdom, many suitors sought her hand, but she refused all proposals, saying, "I do not desire to have anyone as my father-in-law after the Prophet of Allah."[^62]

His fourth wife was Umm Ishaq, daughter of Talha ibn Ubaydullah al-Taymi.[^63] She was previously married to Husayn's brother Hasan and gave birth to two sons and one daughter. When Hasan was poisoned, he advised Husayn to marry Umm Ishaq, which he did. Husayn's fifth wife was from the tribe of Qudha'ah, though her name is not recorded in historical sources.[^64] She gave birth to one child, Ja'far, who died in childhood.[^65]

All historians agree on at least six children of Husayn: Imam Zayn al-Abidin, Ali al-Akbar, Ali al-Asghar (Ali the Younger, an infant), Ja'far, Fatima, and Sakina.[^66] The tragedy of Karbala deeply affected Husayn's family structure. Ali al-Akbar was killed in battle, and according to tradition, Ali al-Asghar, who was an infant sitting on Husayn's lap, was struck by an arrow and died.[^67] Husayn's half-brothers were also killed at Karbala, including the renowned Abbas ibn Ali, and the sons of Aqil ibn Abi Talib, Jafar ibn Abi Talib, and Hasan ibn Ali were slain.[^68]

The survivors of Karbala, including Ali Zayn al-Abidin (who was too ill to fight), the women, and children, were taken as captives before Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad in Kufa and then before Yazid in Damascus.[^69] According to accounts, Yazid treated them relatively well and eventually sent them back to Medina.[^70] The women of Husayn's family, particularly his sister Zaynab bint Ali, played crucial roles in ensuring the message of Karbala reached the wider Muslim community through their testimonies and speeches while in captivity.

Husayn's personality is described in Islamic sources as combining courage with compassion, firmness in principle with gentleness in personal relations. Scholar Wilferd Madelung suggests that Husayn might have inherited his father Ali's "fighting spirit," contrasting him with his brother Hasan, who is described as more pacifist in temperament.[^71] Yet Husayn also demonstrated patience, having waited nearly twenty years after his father's death before taking active opposition to the Umayyad caliphate. His decision to bring his family with him on the journey to Kufa has been interpreted variously—some see it as confidence in success, others as a demonstration that he was not leading a military rebellion but rather making a principled migration, and still others as an acceptance of inevitable martyrdom that he wanted witnessed and transmitted.

## Legacy

Husayn ibn Ali's legacy profoundly shaped Islamic history, religious practice, and political thought, particularly within Shia Islam but also resonating across the broader Muslim world. His martyrdom at Karbala became one of the central defining elements of Islamic heritage and is commemorated annually through the Ashura festival by Shia Muslims worldwide.[^72] The killing of the Prophet Muhammad's grandson shocked the Muslim community and created a watershed moment in Islamic consciousness.[^73]

For Shia Muslims, Husayn's martyrdom is the paradigmatic story of existential tragedy, of injustice in this world triumphing over justice temporarily, and of the duty a true Muslim has to sacrifice oneself for principle.[^74] His death is understood not as a military failure but as a spiritual triumph that established eternal principles about resistance to tyranny and the preservation of authentic Islam. Husayn's martyrdom provides an example of selfless sacrifice in the cause of divine justice in the face of human oppression.[^75]

The impact of Karbala on Shia identity cannot be overstated. The event gave the early pro-Alid political party a distinct religious identity and helped transform it into a distinct religious sect, crystallizing what would become Shia Islam.[^76] The battle helped secure the position of the Umayyad dynasty in the short term, but among Shiite Muslims, the 10th of Muharram became an annual holy day of public mourning that continues to the present day.[^77]

The mourning of Muharram, particularly the Day of Ashura (the tenth day), became the most significant religious observance in Shia Islam. Shiite Muslims observe the first ten days of Muharram as days of lamentation, culminating in Ashura.[^78] Millions of Shia Muslims commemorate Husayn's sacrifice during this annual mourning ritual through gatherings, speeches, poetic recitations, and processions.[^79] In Karbala itself, the tawarij march sees male and then female mourners walk barefoot to Husayn's shrine in the afternoon of Ashura.[^80]

The main component of mourning ceremonies is the recitation of Karbala narratives (maqtal literature) intended to raise the sympathy of audiences and move them to tears, while elegies (nawha) and dirges (marsiya) are chanted as participants strike their chests to share in Husayn's pain.[^81] Processions of mourners annually march the streets during Muharram, especially on Ashura, chanting dirges and elegies.[^82] Theatrical reenactment of Karbala narratives (ta'ziyeh) is a historically significant ritual found mostly in Iran, where the "martyrdom of Husayn" is reenacted on Ashura.[^83]

The physical symbols associated with Husayn's martyrdom hold deep significance. The alam signifies the battle standard of Husayn at Karbala carried by his brother Abbas ibn Ali, while nakhl signifies the bier of Husayn.[^84] The shrine of Husayn in Karbala became one of the holiest sites in Shia Islam, attracting millions of pilgrims annually, particularly during Muharram and Arbaeen (the fortieth day after Ashura).

Beyond religious ritual, Husayn's legacy has profoundly influenced political movements and resistance to oppression. Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shiites in countries such as Iran, Iraq, and Lebanon have interpreted Husayn's martyrdom at Karbala as symbolic of religious and political resistance against oppression.[^85] The Iranian Revolution of 1979 extensively used Karbala symbolism, with protesters viewing the Shah's regime as analogous to Yazid's tyranny and themselves as following Husayn's example of resistance. Revolutionary speeches and literature were saturated with references to Karbala and martyrdom.

In contemporary Shia thought, Karbala symbolizes the eternal struggle between good and evil, the pinnacle of self-sacrifice, and the ultimate defense of Muhammad's prophetic mission against corruption.[^86] Mourners participate in commemorations not merely to remember historical events but to share in Husayn's pain and hope to benefit from his intercession on the Day of Judgment, while viewing mourning for Husayn as an act of protest against oppression.[^87]

The legacy extends beyond Shia communities. Almost all Muslims, regardless of sectarian affiliation, consider Husayn honorable because he was the grandson of Muhammad and because of the belief that he sacrificed himself for principle.[^88] His stand has been interpreted across Islamic history as establishing the principle that Muslims must resist unjust authority and that the preservation of Islamic values takes precedence over personal safety.

## Historical Assessment

### Positive Views

The overwhelming majority of Islamic scholarship across sectarian lines views Husayn ibn Ali as a noble figure who made the ultimate sacrifice for principle. According to scholar Laura Veccia Vaglieri, only Umayyad adherents who considered Husayn "a rebel against the established authority" condoned his murder by Yazid, but their opinion was opposed by the majority of Muslims.[^89] Almost all Muslims, including Sunnis, consider Husayn honorable because he was the grandson of Muhammad and because of the widespread belief that he sacrificed himself to preserve Islamic integrity.[^90]

Leading contemporary Islamicist Professor Wilferd Madelung has made significant contributions to modern scholarship on Husayn and the events of Karbala.[^91] Madelung and other scholars emphasize Husayn's moral courage and his refusal to compromise on fundamental principles. They view his uprising not as a reckless political adventure but as a necessary stand against the transformation of the caliphate into dynastic tyranny. These scholars argue that Husayn's martyrdom preserved the prophetic tradition's emphasis on justice and moral leadership.

Scholar Vaglieri noted that contemporary accounts of the Battle of Karbala form "a coherent and credible narrative," defending the historical reliability of the traditional account against revisionist attempts to minimize the event.[^92] Madelung and Wellhausen assert that the battle lasted from sunrise to sunset, contradicting claims that it was merely a quick massacre, and they affirm that the overall account is reliable.[^93] This scholarly consensus establishes Karbala as a well-documented historical event rather than pious legend.

From a Shia perspective, Husayn is viewed as infallible (ma'sum) as the third Imam and his decisions are seen as divinely guided. Shia scholars emphasize that Husayn knew he was marching toward martyrdom but chose this path because it was necessary to awaken the Muslim community to Umayyad corruption and to establish a permanent example of resistance to tyranny. They interpret his willingness to bring his family as evidence of his confidence in the ultimate spiritual victory of his cause, despite military defeat.

Husayn's famous statements articulating his mission are cited approvingly by scholars across traditions. His declaration that he rose "in quest of establishing right orders in the community of my grandfather" and wished to "command right and forbid wrong" is viewed as a clear articulation of Islamic reform principles.[^94] His statement that "death with honor is better than a life of degradation" has become a widely admired expression of moral courage.

Historians note that Husayn's martyrdom had the profound effect of giving the pro-Alid movement a distinct religious identity and helping transform it into Shia Islam as a distinct sect.[^95] Rather than viewing this as divisive, many scholars see it as a necessary development that preserved important aspects of Islamic thought and practice that might otherwise have been lost. The revenge for Husayn's death became a rallying cry that helped undermine the Umayyad caliphate, demonstrating the political consequences of moral failure.[^96]

The Battle of Karbala was documented even by early Christian sources, including a history by the Syriac Christian scholar Theophilus of Edessa, who was chief astrologer in the Abbasid court between 775 and 785.[^97] This external documentation supports the historical significance and reality of the events. Scholars emphasize that Husayn's stand influenced not only Islamic religious development but also Islamic political theory, establishing principles about legitimate authority, the right to resist tyranny, and the limits of obedience to unjust rulers.

### Negative Views

While Husayn himself is generally respected, some scholars have criticized his political judgment and the decision to march toward Kufa despite warnings. Several wise companions who loved Husayn advised him not to go to Iraq, including Abdullah ibn Abbas, Abdullah ibn Umar, and Abu Sa'eed al-Khudri, warning him that the Kufans were unreliable and had previously betrayed his father and brother.[^98] Critics argue that Husayn's decision to ignore this sound advice demonstrated poor political calculation and resulted in an avoidable tragedy.

Some Sunni scholars, particularly those seeking to maintain communal unity, have criticized Husayn's uprising against Yazid as divisive. Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi accused him of dividing the Muslim community (ummah) at a time when unity was essential for Islamic strength.[^99] These critics argue that the principle of avoiding fitna (internal strife and civil war) should have taken precedence over objections to Yazid's character or qualifications. They suggest that Husayn should have followed the example of his brother Hasan, who made peace with Muawiya to preserve unity, even at the cost of accepting less-than-ideal leadership.

A more polemical criticism, though largely rejected by serious scholarship, alleged that Husayn was motivated by worldly ambition rather than principle. Some medieval Christian polemicists claimed he fought to satisfy worldly desires and political ambitions.[^100] However, there is no credible evidence in historical and hadith literature to support the claim that Husayn was after power for its own sake.[^101] His refusal of safe passage in exchange for submission to Yazid, and his willingness to face certain death, directly contradict accusations of mere power-seeking. Most scholars, including critics of his political strategy, acknowledge his sincere motives.

Scholar Henri Lammens presented a revisionist interpretation arguing there was no real battle at Karbala but rather a quick massacre, based on a single official report to Caliph Yazid.[^102] However, this hypothesis was strongly criticized by historian Laura Veccia Vaglieri, who pointed out that Lammens based his argument on a single isolated report while ignoring the broader coherent narrative from multiple contemporary sources.[^103] Madelung and Wellhausen's research supports the traditional account of an extended battle lasting from sunrise to sunset.[^104]

Some historians have questioned whether Husayn adequately assessed the military and political realities before setting out for Kufa. They argue that he placed too much trust in the letters from Kufa without sufficient verification, despite having sent his cousin Muslim ibn Aqeel to investigate. When news of Muslim's execution and the collapse of Kufa support reached him, critics suggest he should have abandoned the journey rather than proceeding to what had become certain death. They question whether martyrdom, however noble, was the most responsible choice given his obligations to his family and followers.

The question of who bears ultimate responsibility for Husayn's death has generated debates that sometimes turn into critiques of Husayn's decision-making. Some emphasize the Kufans' betrayal and unreliability, suggesting Husayn should have known better than to trust them.[^105] Others focus on Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad's cruelty or Yazid's ultimate responsibility as caliph. These debates about responsibility sometimes implicitly criticize Husayn for creating a situation where such a tragedy could occur.

Certain commemorative practices associated with Husayn, rather than his actions themselves, have drawn criticism. Extreme forms of self-flagellation during Ashura mourning, sometimes involving self-inflicted bloodshed, are controversial and condemned by many Shia scholars as innovative practices that damage Islam's reputation.[^106] Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei banned such practices in Iran in 1994.[^107] While these criticisms target mourning practices rather than Husayn himself, they reflect ongoing debates about the appropriate way to honor his memory.
