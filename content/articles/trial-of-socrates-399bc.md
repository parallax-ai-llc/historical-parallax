## Overview

In 399 BC, 70-year-old Socrates was put on trial in democratic Athens.
**The Charges:**
1.  Corrupting the youth.
2.  Impiety (not believing in the gods of the state and inventing new deities).
**Real Reason:** Political retribution. Socrates had associated with the "Thirty Tyrants" who briefly overthrew the democracy (like Critias). He was a "gadfly" stinging the lazy horse of Athens.

## The Apology

(Recorded by Plato).
Socrates refused to beg for mercy or bring his weeping children to court (the standard tactic).
Instead, he lectured the jury of 501 citizens.
He claimed he was the wisest man because *"I know that I know nothing."*
He claimed he was a gift from God to the city.

## The Vote and Sentence

**Guilty:** 280 to 221. A close vote.
**Penalty Phase:**
The accusers proposed death.
Socrates could have proposed exile or a fine. Instead, he sarcastically proposed that he be given **"free meals for life at the Prytaneum"** (like an Olympic hero).
The jury was furious. They voted for death by a larger margin than the guilty verdict (360 to 141).

## The Hemlock

His friends (Crito) bribed the guards and arranged an escape.
Socrates refused. He argued that he had lived under Athens' laws all his life and accepted their benefits; strict obedience to the law (Social Contract) required him to accept their punishment now.
He drank the cup of poison hemlock calmly, discoursing on the immortality of the soul until his legs went numb and reached his heart.
**Last Words:** *"Crito, we owe a rooster to Asclepius. Please, don't forget to pay the debt."* (Asclepius was the god of healing; implying death is the cure for life).
