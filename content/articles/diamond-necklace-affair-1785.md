## Overview

A complex con game that brought down the French Monarchy.
**The Necklace:** A monstrous piece of jewelry with 647 diamonds (2,800 carats), worth a battleship. King Louis XVI offered it to Marie Antoinette, but she refused ("We have more need of Seventy-Fours [ships] than of necklaces").
**The Con:**
A con artist posing as a countess, **Jeanne de la Motte**, convinced the Cardinal de Rohan (who was desperate to gain the Queen's favor) that the Queen secretly wanted the necklace but couldn't buy it publicly.
She forged letters from the Queen. She even hired a prostitute who looked like the Queen to meet the Cardinal in the gardens of Versailles at night.

## The Scandal

The Cardinal broke the necklace up and gave the diamonds to Jeanne (who sold them).
The jewelers eventually demanded payment from the Queen.
The Queen knew nothing.
**The Trial:**
The King foolishly arrested the Cardinal and put him on public trial.
The trial exposed the naivety of the Cardinal and the "loose morals" of the court.
Although the Queen was innocent, the public believed she had used the Con to destroy her enemy (the Cardinal).
She was nicknamed *"Madame Deficit"* and hated more than ever. Napoleon later said this scandal was one of the three causes of the French Revolution.
