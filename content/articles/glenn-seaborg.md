## Summary

Glenn Seaborg was an American chemist who shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discoveries of transuranium elements. He co-discovered ten elements including plutonium, americium, curium, and seaborgium (named after him while still alive, a unique honor). He served as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission under three presidents. Seaborg's actinide concept reorganized the periodic table.
