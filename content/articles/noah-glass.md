## Summary

Noah Glass is often cited as the overlooked co-founder of Twitter who coined the name 'Twitter' and championed the idea internally at Odeo. He was pushed out of the company early and rarely received credit for his foundational role. After Twitter, he founded Olo, a digital ordering platform for restaurants that went public in 2021. His story illustrates how startup founding narratives often obscure key contributors.
