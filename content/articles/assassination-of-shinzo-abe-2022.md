## Overview

On July 8, 2022, Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving Prime Minister, was assassinated while delivering a campaign speech in Nara, Japan. Tetsuya Yamagami approached Abe from behind and fired two shots using a homemade firearm. Abe was airlifted to hospital but died from blood loss several hours later. The assassination—the first of a former Japanese Prime Minister since 1936—shocked a nation known for exceptionally low gun violence and exposed unexpected connections between Japanese politics and the Unification Church.
