## Overview
On July 8, 2022, Shinzo Abe, Japans longest-serving Prime Minister, was assassinated in Nara while campaigning for a Liberal Democratic Party candidate.

## The Event
Tetsuya Yamagami approached Abe from behind and fired two shots with a handmade double-barreled shotgun. Abe was airlifted to a hospital but later died from his injuries. The motive was linked to Abes alleged connections to the Unification Church.

## Aftermath
The event stunned Japan, a nation with strict gun control laws. It led to investigations into the Unification Churchs political influence and a re-evaluation of security protocols for public figures.
