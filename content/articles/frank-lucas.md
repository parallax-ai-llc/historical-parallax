## Summary
Frank Lucas was an American drug trafficker who operated in Harlem, New York during the late 1960s and early 1970s. He claimed to have smuggled heroin from Southeast Asia in the coffins of dead American soldiers. His story was dramatized in the 2007 film 'American Gangster.'

## Early Life
Born September 9, 1930, in La Grange, North Carolina. He moved to Harlem as a teenager and became the right-hand man of Harlem crime boss Bumpy Johnson. After Johnson's death in 1968, Lucas took over. [^1]

## Criminal Career
Lucas established a direct connection with heroin producers in the Golden Triangle of Southeast Asia, bypassing traditional Mafia middlemen. He claimed to smuggle heroin into the US in the coffins of dead American servicemen returning from Vietnam. His brand, 'Blue Magic,' was known for its high purity. He amassed a fortune estimated at $52 million. [^2]

## Capture / Downfall
Lucas was arrested in 1975 by a federal task force. He was convicted of drug trafficking and sentenced to 70 years in prison. He cooperated with prosecutors, providing information that led to over 100 convictions, and his sentence was reduced. He was released in 1981 but arrested again in 1984. He was finally released in 1991. He died May 30, 2019. [^3]
